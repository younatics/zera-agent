"By . Chris Greenwood . A payout of £4,500 to Milly Dowler’s killer provoked outrage among MPs and campaigners last night. Levi Bellfield was granted compensation for a prison attack when a fellow inmate attempted to blind him. He suffered only minor cuts to his face. He sued the Government for failing to protect him at high-security Wakefield Prison and won a three-year legal battle after the Ministry of Justice admitted full liability at a county court hearing. Payout: Levi Bellfield (left), who was jailed in 2011 for the murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler (right), has been awarded £4,500 in compensation after being attacked by an inmate at Wakefield Prison in Yorkshire . It is understood that the long dispute, as civil servants tried to contest his claim, has run up a substantial legal bill which will be met by taxpayers. Bellfield has told friends he will spend the money renting a caravan in Kent for his elderly mother. Last night Labour MP Ian Austin condemned the payout as ‘disgusting’ and promised to raise it with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. He said: ‘This is a complete and utter disgrace. I will be asking Mr Grayling how this evil child murderer could possibly be awarded such a huge sum of money. Every right-thinking person will agree this is distasteful and wrong.’ National Victims’ Association founder David Hines added: ‘It really gets us that murderers claim for being attacked and get rewards. It’s a sin.’ Bellfield was told in 2011 that he would die behind bars for the murder of the 13-year-old in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, nine years earlier. Attack: Bellfield won the compensation after being attacked by an inmate with a makeshift weapon at Wakefield prison in Yorkshire (pictured) in 2009 . Outrage: Labour MP Ian Austin, pictured, condemned the payout as 'disgusting' and promised to raise it with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling . He was already serving a whole life term handed down in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell. Bellfield lured Milly back to his flat before killing her and dumping her body in remote woodland in Hampshire where he used to walk his dog. The teenager’s skeletal remains were found six months later. A series of police blunders left Bellfield free to stalk and kill two more victims and attempt to kill a third. The compensation is likely to enrage the Dowler family, who were forced to relive their ordeal during the Old Bailey trial. Speaking after Bellfield’s conviction, her mother Sally said she hoped the killer would receive the ‘same brutality’ in prison that he used against his victims. ‘The length to which the system goes to protect his human rights seems so unfair compared to what we as a family have had to endure,’ she added. The attack took place when an inmate with a makeshift weapon tried to stab Bellfield in the eye at the West Yorkshire prison in 2009. Victims: Bellfield got a whole life term in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange (left), 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell (right) The burly former bouncer and wheel clamper only suffered a minor scrape but claimed prison guards should have protected him. Ministry of Justice lawyers spent three years trying to stop Bellfield receiving any taxpayer-funded compensation. But earlier this week he was awarded the cash at Durham County Court after they were forced to admit full liability. A source close to Bellfield’s family said: ‘Levi will transfer the funds to relatives. He wants them to use it on the caravan. ‘He’s angry that prison guards let him in that part of the prison. He says by putting him in that wing, it was just asking for an attack to happen. Another inmate waited for him outside one of the bathrooms. The inmate went for his eye but missed. It was pretty tame.’ A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘We are hugely disappointed that Levi Bellfield was awarded £4,500 by a judge following an assault by a prisoner in 2009 at HMP Wakefield.’","Levi Bellfield wins compensation after he was attacked by fellow inmate .

"By . Leon Watson . Their iconic shape has remained largely the same for more than 100 years. But time is finally catching up with the instantly-recognisable cast iron fire hydrant, seen on so many street corners. Now, the humble hydrant is to get a makeover. A new tamper-proof and incredibly durable model has been designed that will replace the old ones that apparently continually break down. It won't break, leak or freeze and, its makers say, will save lives. Sigelock fire hydrant is designed to be more reliable than its predecessor, which has remained largely the same for 100 years . Not a sprinkler: When it gets hot, residents have been known to open up fire hydrants to relieve themselves from the sweltering heat . The Sigelock Spartan was designed by a former New York firefighter and is intended to work when people need them. George Sigelakis, founder of a company called Sigelock Systems, told Jessica Hullinger of Fastcoexist.com: 'It would shock you how often fire hydrants don’t work when you need them. 'People live under a false sense of . security. People don’t realize they need it until they need it, and when . they need it, it doesn’t work.' In April, a Channel 2 Action News investigation in Atlanta, Georgia, revealed that many of the city's hydrants are running dry. It found Georgia does not have a standard dictating how often public fire hydrants should be checked. Mr Sigelakis, who retired from the NYFD in 2000, spent 20 years researching, developing, and perfecting his prototypes.

'This is a maintenance-free hydrant.' There are currently 150 Sigelock hydrants installed across 11 states.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Romanian society girl who announced in a blaze of publicity that she was adopting a boy from an orphanage has secretly returned him after just one day. Monica Columbeanu, 26, whose friends include Paris Hilton, vowed to give three-year-old Alex Gabriel a life 'in which he would want nothing'. But she took him back after spending just one night at her mansion reportedly because his crying kept her awake. Handed back: Romanian socialite Monica Columbeanu is pictured with three-year-old Alex Gabriel (right) whom she adopted but returned to his orphanage after one day reportedly because his crying kept her awake . Stefan Cristofor, a businessman from Bucharest who runs a charity helping orphans with his daughter Mihaela, confirmed they had arranged the meeting between Monica and Alex. Mihaela said: 'Monica wanted to spend a weekend with the boy that she wanted to adopt. But the child could not adapt. 'In the evening, when she put him to bed, he began to cry and could not sleep. The next day she took him back to the orphanage. 'The question of adoption was simply stopped at that point because quite simply she didn't want him any more.' Change of heart: Monica Columbeanu (pictured playing with Alex, right, and left with Paris Hilton) told media at the time of the adoption that she wanted to the boy a life 'in which he would want nothing' Monica has been in the public spotlight since she was 18 when she married multi-millionaire businessman Irinel Columbeanu, then aged 56. To rebuff claims she had only married him for his money, Monica started a PR tour that included a visit to the Jiu Placement Center for Orphans in Bucharest. There she met three-year-old Alex and announced it was wrong for children to be kept in institutions – and set about the process of adopting him. She told the media: 'I'll make sure he won't lack anything and by that I mean primarily parental love.' Monica Columbeanu (second right) joins Paris Hilton (third left) to open a  milk shake store in Shanghai in May . As a result, Alex was whisked away to enjoy a weekend in the luxurious Izvorani family mansion. But after he reportedly failed to sleep at night in his new bed and kept his new mother awake, he was quietly taken back to the orphanage and the adoption process was dropped. Alex is now currently preparing for his first year at school. Since splitting with her former husband, Monica has become one of the hottest society girls in Romania and she still has a taste for wealthy lovers. Her current boyfriend, according to Romanian media, has given her a £90,000 car and she has been seen partying with Paris Hilton.","Monica Columbeanu vowed to give boy, 3, new life after learning of his plight .

"A woman has died and six other people have been injured, one critically, when a tourist bus left Victoria's Great Ocean Road and plunged down a ravine. The bus carrying Korean tourists came to a stop at the bottom of a 20-metre gap. The woman, a passenger, died at the crash site at Princetown. 'We believe that most of the patients are Korean nationals. They were on a sightseeing tour on The Great Ocean Road,' Ambulance Victoria spokesman Paul Holman told Fairfax Radio. The mini-bus reportedly plunged down a 20-metre ravine . The accident happened at Gellibrand Lower, approximately three hours south-west of Melbourne . 'It is quite a remote scene and getting resources in there has been difficult.' Emergency crews have freed the survivors and a critically-injured male passenger is being airlifted to Melbourne's The Alfred hospital. The male driver and one passenger with serious injuries will also be airlifted to hospital, police say. Three other passengers have minor injuries and are being taken by ambulance to Geelong Hospital. The Great Ocean Road, a popular tourist drive, was closed to traffic between Princetown and Gellibrand River roads after the accident, which happened about 1.40pm on Thursday.","Bus was travelling from Melbourne and crashed at Gellibrand Lower .

"One target had the grave of his mother dug up and her urn stolen . By . Chris Greenwood . Debbie Vincent, a former soldier who became an animal rights commander was today jailed for her part in a conspiracy to blackmail a laboratory testing with a campaign of terror . A former soldier who became an animal rights commander was today jailed for her part in a conspiracy to blackmail a laboratory testing with a campaign of terror. Debbie Vincent - who underwent a sex change after leaving the Army - was jailed for six years for her involvement in the Europe-wide conspiracy by the Stop . Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac) group against Cambridge-based . Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS). The campaign of terror involved the use of improvised explosive devices and the desecration of graves. One target of the activists even had the grave of his mother dug up and the urn containing her ashes stolen and never returned. Vincent, who served in the Army and fathered a son before undergoing a sex change, rose through the ranks of extremists as others were jailed. She was finally brought to justice after being recorded by an undercover police officer as she tried to broker a deal in which one company agreed to stop dealing with HLS. Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the jury during her trial that the protests, which targeted suppliers and customers of HLS, also included falsely accusing staff members of being paedophiles, sending incendiary devices and hoax bombs, posting sanitary towels claimed to be infected with Aids, and causing criminal damage to people’s homes and cars. He said the aim of the campaign was to put HLS out of business through cutting off its suppliers by creating a 'climate of fear'. The damage from arson attacks and other criminal damage as well as from extra security for the companies involved topped £1 million, he said. Sentencing the 52-year-old, who acted as the public spokeswoman for Shac, Judge Keith Cutler said: 'It is difficult for a judge to calculate the repugnance felt by society to such appalling acts. 'Nothing at all could justify such attacks.' He added: 'You express no shred of remorse or condemnation for the incidents of extreme terror and desecration which have been caused. 'There is not an inkling of understanding the distress those actions must have caused.' Animal rights activists gather on the steps outside Winchester Crown Court today. Vincent has been jailed for her involvement in the Europe-wide conspiracy by the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac) group against Cambridge-based Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) She was also handed her a five-year anti-social behaviour order (Asbo) to commence on her release from prison. Judge Cutler said that Vincent was of good character and had received positive character references, but that she had been involved in a conspiracy which terrorised its victims. 'Not a shred of remorse': Debbie Vincent . He said: 'You could not care less for the pain, distress and loss the conspiracy was causing others.' He added: 'These measures were used with the fear and terror they caused, indeed some aspects of the case indicate the activists enjoyed causing such terror.' Judge Cutler said: 'I come to a conclusion you are a lady of very good character indeed, if it wasn’t for your complete obsession with your cause and an inability to accept its limits within law, there was so much good you have been able to do for other people you have met in your life and for all the animal welfare work you have done. 'There is so much there but sadly you have to face a considerable custodial sentence.' Vincent showed no emotion as the sentence was handed out to her. Mr Bowes said: 'There is no evidence that Debbie Vincent was present at the scene of any of the attacks or indeed in Europe or any evidence she was outside of the UK at the time of these attacks. 'She was however a knowing participant in the conspiracy to blackmail which did involve these attacks. 'Debbie Vincent’s role grew and she was in the later period involved in the running of Shac.' James Wood QC, defending, said that Vincent was suffering with her health and that  she had also lost her sister shortly after the trial concluded. Describing her as 'vulnerable', he said: 'Prison for her is going to be extremely hard to endure, the publicity which surrounded this trial focused upon that feature of her background that was unique and unusual and the very frank way in her evidence she spoke of that background identifying in graphic terms her former role as a male soldier, her marriage and fathering of a child.' Most of the crimes commited against the Huntingdon Life Sciences research centre were trying to destroy it. Some of the incidences were incredibly violent crimes, including blackmail and allegedly trying to infect people with the AIDS virus . Mr Bowes said that the main tactic used was to publish the names of companies linked to HLS, and even those which are linked solely to its suppliers, on the Shac website which would then lay these firms open to the illegal acts of intimidation and violence. He said: 'The threat was chillingly basic, companies were told they were on the website until you publish your surrender and once you do we will very kindly take you off.' Mr Bowes said that Vincent worked alongside the masterminds behind Shac, Greg and Natasha Avery, at their headquarters near Hook, Hampshire, and she was even given access to the computer used to co-ordinate the illegal actions. The pair were among seven defendants jailed for a total of 50 years in 2009 for their part in the conspiracy. The jury was shown an interview given by Vincent to the BBC during the following month. She said during the interview: 'People are frustrated over the inaction of the government and the vested interest from the vivisection industry in addressing these important issues. 'And there will be more direct, what people call clandestine action.' Mr Bowes explained that the actions of Shac went beyond the right to protest or freedom of expression. He said: 'People are entitled to hold strong views in this country and freedom of expression is one of our most cherished liberties but what people are not entitled to do is menace others with their demands and this is about the making of unwarranted demands with menaces.' The case against Vincent was that she was aware of the militant actions but did not allege that she took part in them. Vincent was arrested in July 2012 at the same time as Swiss-born Sven van Hasselt and British woman Natasha Simpkins, who was born in Germany. Vincent showed no emotion as she was jailed for six years . The pair were detained in the Netherlands and are still awaiting extradition to the UK to face the same charge. In April 2008 Vincent helped to organise and gave a speech at a demonstration held at the premises of Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis, a supplier of HLS, in Horsham, West Sussex, the court heard. He went on to detail a series of vandalism attacks on the homes of employees of Novartis including some in Germany where slogans such as 'murderer' were painted on their homes. The jury was shown photographs of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which had been placed underneath the cars of employees. He also described how in May 2009, the then chairman of the board of directors at Novartis, Dr Daniel Vasella was targeted. The grave of his mother in Switzerland was desecrated and dug up and the urn containing her cremated remains was stolen. Mr Bowes said the urn was never recovered. Two crosses were placed in the ground, daubed in red paint, and the 'death date' of Dr Vasella’s wife was written on one of them, he said. An email sent to Dr Vasella on August 18 2009 said: 'You have 2 choices Mr Vasella: lose HLS or lose the urn.' The court was also told during the trial that an undercover police officer had infiltrated the group to gather evidence for the prosecution. A CPS spokeswoman confirmed that the 'undercover law enforcement officer', who used the pseudonym James Adams, gave evidence concerning meetings between Vincent and Novartis . Describing the undercover officer’s involvement in the prosecution, a CPS spokeswoman said: 'An undercover law enforcement officer known under the pseudonym ‘James Adams’ was involved in the case and he gave evidence during the trial as to his involvement in meetings that had taken place between Debbie Vincent and representatives of Novartis. 'Nothing further about his identity was revealed during the court proceedings.' The CPS spokeswoman also confirmed that during her evidence, Vincent gave her birth name as Peter Vincent and said that she had been a soldier in the British Army before undergoing gender re-assignment surgery. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Service said that it did not comment on the activities of undercover police officers.","Debbie Vincent found guilty of blackmailing animal testing companies .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Birmingham City Council has questions to answer about claims it ignored warnings about a Trojan Horse takeover of schools by Islamic extremists, Michael Gove said today. The Education Secretary said that it was essential that extremists were denied a platform in schools and other public institutions to push their agenda. A major report by former top counter-terror police officer Peter Clarke is expected to criticise officials in Birmingham and Whitehall for failing to act on concerns about teaching in some schools. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the council in Birmingham and his own department in Whitehall had questions to answer over the way they responded to concerns about schools in the city . The investigation came after allegations of a takeover plot in Birmingham schools by hardline Muslims. Head teachers told Ofsted there was an organised campaign to impose a ‘narrow, faith-based ideology’ at some schools in the city. It placed five of the city’s schools in special measures after ‘deeply worrying’ findings. Mr Clarke was brought in to carry out a review of the way complaints were handled an acted upon during more than a decade. The inquiry has identified up to 25 state schools, some directly run by the council, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Former top counter-terror police officer Peter Clarke was asked to review the handling of extremism in schools over more than a decade . Mr Gove told BBC One’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘There are broader questions about the extent to which these activities were coordinated and the extent to which those responsible for these activities may have had a broader agenda. ‘Peter is looking into that and we have to wait to see what he concludes... ‘There are questions for the local authority and of course for my department, the Department for Education about what was known and what was done.’ He defended his decision to appoint Mr Clarke, the former Scotland Yard head of counter-terrorism, to lead the investigation. ‘There was some criticism, right at the beginning of this process, when I appointed Peter. People felt that it was in some respects, too dramatic and authoritarian a step. 'But the view that I took was if you have a police officer of unimpeachable integrity to conduct these investigations, if people are at the end of this process cleared, given a clean bill of health, then that is the most effective way of ensuring that public confidence can be restored.’ Mr Clarke’s report is expected to be published later this summer. The government has announced that schools will be shut down if they fail to promote British values. Mr Gove called for a 'robust' defence of liberal values in the face of the challenge from Islamist extremists. 'Islamism is a perversion of Islam in the same way that communism was a perversion of socialism and fascism is a perversion of nationalism,' he said. The inquiry is said to have identified up to 25 state schools in Birmingham, some directly run by the council, where concerns ere raised about the influence of extremists . 'If liberalism is to survive - and I believe liberalism is the way in which we approach these issues, liberal values are our best protector - we need to be robust. 'We need to challenge those views and we need to make sure that people who have views that are inimical to liberal values and wish to use institutions to push an agenda which is inimical to liberal values are not in a position where they can use public money or the public square in order to push their views.' Mr Gove - who has previously clashed publicly with Home Secretary Theresa May over the Government's handling of the issue - went out of his way to praise her. 'No Home Secretary has been as vigilant in dealing with the terror threat as Theresa May,' he said. 'I think she has done a very good job in this area.'","Education Secretary defends inquiry into Islamic extremism in the classroom .

A popular show's final episode has become a cultural touchstone and a point of debate with hits such as The Sopranos, Dexter and Seinfeld raising eyebrows with their controversial endings. The 75-minute final episode of Breaking Bad was written and directed by show creator Vince Gilligan and it somehow managed to live up to the hype. Scroll below for video... Final episode: Bryan Cranston's Walter White character wrapped up loose ends on Sunday in the series finale of Breaking Bad before succumbing to a gunshot wound . The New York Times weighed in and called it a 'fitting ending, and predictable in only some ways.' Reviewer Alessandra Stanley added: 'So many shows, notably The Sopranos and Lost, have gone dark without anything approaching . finality. Here, the writers were so determined to not leave unfinished . business that the last episode was called 'Felina,' an anagram of . finale.' The review noted that the only question that remained to be answered was why Bryan Cranston's Walter White character became such an over-qualified chemistry teacher in the first place. Variety said the show's finale 'perfectly capped a final arc that was all forward momentum, with barely an ounce of fat on it, and almost nary a false note.' Violent end: Walter went back to New Mexico to confront foes and make amends . Brian Lowry added: 'From the first frame to the last on a . series that absolutely belongs in the conversation of the best ever, . Vince Gilligan knew what he was doing. 'There was a lot of closure in Breaking Bad. You can say that Gilligan gave most of the viewers what they wanted (and, impressively, he did that by staying true to himself and the story without selling out or becoming unrecognizably saccharine as he tied the bow).'Tim Goodman, Hollywood Reporter . ------------------------------------------------------------ . 'Perhaps the best thing about the finale of Breaking Bad is that it actually ended. So many shows, notably The Sopranos and Lost, have gone dark without anything approaching finality.

In some cases, a little too tightly, and in others, not quite as much.'Alessandra Stanley, New York Times------------------------------------------------------------ . 'In what may be the first recorded (and distinctly over-tweeted) perfect finale in television history, AMC's Breaking Bad came to a close Sunday night.

'From the first frame to the last on a series that absolutely belongs in the conversation of the best ever, Vince Gilligan knew what he was doing.

'Tense, witty, violent, oddly tender and, in its own strange way, as close to a 'happy' ending as a story this dark could hope, this last episode brought the story to a straightforward, definitive conclusion, without the spirituality of Lost or the ambiguity of Sopranos.'Robert Bianco, USA Today .

"By . David Kent . Eintracht Frankfurt have signed midfielder Lucas Piazon on a season-long loan from Chelsea. The Brazilian has found it difficult to break into the first team at Stamford Bridge since his arrival in 2012 and spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem where he scored 11 goals in 29 appearances. The 20-year-old previously spent time on loan at Malaga, where he made his Champions League debut, and Frankfurt sporting director Bruno Hubner is delighted to have secured his services. On the move again: Lucas Piazon will spend next season at Eintracht Frankfurt . 'We are glad that we were able to reach an agreement after lengthy but very fair negotiations with Chelsea and Piazon will strengthen us in the coming season,' he told the club's official website. 'He has played on the left wing, he can play on the right and be used as an attacking midfielder.'

"By . Anna Edwards . Instead of giving their real names, the cheeky police note was signed 'Love from Cagney and Lacey' Being drunk and running into the police would normally spell trouble for most revellers. But one man found that instead of being slapped with a fine after getting a little worse for wear, instead he got a humorous handwritten note from concerned police officers who had driven him home. A man, known only as David from Watford, woke on Sunday morning following a heavy night out to discover a note from 'Cagney and Lacey' who had given him a lift after discovering him too drunk to stand. But instead of giving their real names, the note referred to the 1980s series about female New York detectives starring Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless. The letter, on Hertfordshire Constabulary notepaper and addressed to David, explained he had been found barely able to stand shortly after 2am on Sunday (January 12). It said: 'We found you staggering in the road on your way home from Watford. 'You were so drunk we were worried you wouldn’t get home in one piece! So we gave you a lift home. 'Please don’t get that drunk again.' The humorous message was won praise after it was posted on the UK Cop Humour Facebook page with more than 22,000 people ‘liking’ the comment. One user and fellow Watford police . officer Charlie Davison commented: 'And this is why I am proud to be a . Watford officer, public order is pants but everyone does a great job!' A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said it was aware of the letter, but are yet to comment . Mel Cable wrote: 'Absolutely fantastic, kudos to Cagney and Lacey, David struck it lucky to get such good officers willing to help rather than condemn.' However, other users criticised the officers for intervening at all. Gurpal Sindhar wrote: 'And if he then tripped over the front door and banged his head the police would get the blame because if they had let him walk home he’d have been sober by the time he got there.'

"By . Deborah Arthurs . His Christmas menu last year consisted of edible fairy lights, tasty tinsel, pork baubles and a partridge in a pear tree. And, odd as it may sound, the limited edition festive feast, served at Heston Blumenthal's restaurant Fat Duck in Bray, was such a success that the experimental chef is set to roll it out for a second year. This year, the festive menu, created by Blumenthal, Head Chef Lake and their Experimental Kitchen team,  is different - but no less strange. Festive spirit: Last year's Christmas menu was such a success that Heston Blumenthal will be hosting a special Christmas lunch in his flagship restaurant in Bray, The Fat Duck, for a second year . Plum porridge, Gold, Frankincense and Myhrr and . an advent candle are on the menu, with many of the dishes, Fat Duck Head Chef Jonny Lake tells MailOnline, inspired by (but not faithfully recreating) historic festive recipes. 'With any of these things it’s more about the idea,' he said. 'If you actually tried to follow the recipe, they wouldn't taste very nice. 'In fact, they are not recipes as we know them now; they sound more like a story. We adapt it; we make something new from it.' The advent candle, which burns throughout the meal, is cut and served at the end - and found to be made of chocolate with a passionfruit caramel centre. Mince pies with real spiced, sweetened meat are served towards the end of the meal, and plum porridge - which is a beef broth spiced with orange - served at the beginning. A standard Christmas turkey lunch.....very unlike what you will get in Bray this December . And . the Gold, Frankincense and Myhrr, which Jonny says was created by . Blumenthal as one of his first festive dishes, consists of lobster . consommé reduced until it is a jelly, wrapped in gold leaf and served . like a gold bar in a stock made aromatic with frankincense (a resin from . the Boswellia tree) and accompanied by a whiff of myhrr. But will Jonny be bringing some of his wild concoctions into his own home on Christmas day? 'I'll be cooking a turkey,' he said. 'Cover it in gold? Nope. The most unusual thing I'll be doing with it is brining it.' The .

"By . Euan Crumley . For anyone involved in Glasgow 2014, there’s no denying that the nerves are starting to kick in. The tension has moved up a notch and, as the Commonwealth Games move closer, it can only increase. For swimmer Craig McNally, however, that’s just how he likes it. The more nervous he is before competing, the better. After months of painstaking training, during which he pushed himself to new limits with a schedule designed to getting him used to competing tired, the 21-year-old now finds himself in the strange position of feeling like he has energy to burn as he tapers down towards the action at Tollcross. Nerves of steel: Craig McNally aims to win medals for Team Scotland in the pool at the Commonwealth Games . McNally holds the Scottish record for the 200metres backstroke, but he also has his eyes on the top prize in the 100m, an event which gets under way on Thursday, the first day of competition. The hard work has been done. Now it’s a case of ticking over and keeping mind and body attuned but, when asked whether exhaustion or over-exuberance is easier to handle, the answer is unequivocal. ‘Being knackered is easier to deal with because you can just go and lie down for a bit whereas, if you’ve got too much energy, you can go and lie down but all you want to do is go and bounce around,’ he says. ‘I just want to keep on doing stuff at the moment, whereas normally I’d be trying to conserve all my energy because I’d have very little of it and be trying to make sure I had enough for the next few training sessions. ‘I’m still trying to conserve it now but it’s so I can use it on race day.’ Focused: McNally (second right) prepares to dive into the pool at the 2013 swimming World Championships . However, he adds: ‘I find nervous energy is the best thing, that’s the thing I love before the race and I try to focus on getting as nervous as possible before the race because that’s what helps me go out fast and not feel the pain until the later stages of a race.’ McNally and his team-mates will move from their Aberdeen camp into the athletes’ village in Glasgow on Sunday, the latest indication of how large these long-awaited Games are looming. ‘It’s definitely starting to sink in now, having got the kit, having been with the team and with everyone tapering down and getting loads of energy,’ he continues. ‘It’s starting to feel like we should be at the competition — it definitely feels time for it now, which is good, and everyone is excited.’ With a place in the 4x100m relay team, too, McNally will compete over the whole duration of the competition. ‘I have a day or two in the middle to recover from the 100m and get ready for the 200m so it’s quite full-on,’ he says, while clearly relishing the chance to get into the action right from day one. Splash: McNally will aim to win medals in the 100m backstroke, 200m backstroke and 4x100m relay . ‘I’ll be trying my hardest for both (the 100m and 200m). The 200 is my better event and that’s the one I’m hoping to do my best on but I’m focusing on the 100 equally as much, just because that’s the first event, it gets me into the meet and I never know what will happen. ‘For me, it doesn’t really matter whether I’m racing at the start of the meet or the end of the meet, it’s just about getting myself switched on.’ The McNally clan will be out in force, along with the rest of what will be the most partisan of crowds, to cheer him on. A medal or two - and a record-breaking performance - would be the perfect token of gratitude. The good news is that, apparently, the refurbished Tollcross venue will be perfectly suited to fast performances. ‘I’m not really sure how it all works but I know that Tollcross Pool has always been thought of as a fast pool, so I think there will be very fast times,’ says McNally, who will cast his eyes to Olympic qualification for Rio once all this is over. ‘Every time I get in, when I try to perform at my peak, I’ll be trying to improve on my Scottish record and trying to get the most out the race that I possibly can at that moment. ‘I’m looking forward to some fast times. Hopefully I’m able to get high up on the podium.’ Quick as they come: McNally holds the Scottish record for the 200m backstroke .","Scottish swimmer believes the more nervous he gets, the better he is .

"By . Derek Hunter . Michael Jamieson's silver medal was a rare highlight for British Swimming at London 2012. At the Commonwealth Games he will go for gold for Scotland on the opening evening, and might need to break the world record to get it. Despite receiving £25m in funding during the four-year build up to the Games, Team GB returned a paltry three medals. Focused: Scottish swimmer Michael Jamieson is determined to win gold after grabbing silver at London 2012 . Decent bet: Commonwealth and Olympic medalist Steve Parry has backed Jamieson, pictured, to shine . The other two were bronze, both won by Becky Adlington. They fell two medals short of their pre-games target and had their funding slashed by 15% ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics. But Steve Parry, who won one Olympic and three Commonwealth medals during his career, claims British swimmers are about to bounce back in Glasgow. ‘At the Olympics we were always there or thereabouts, but we didn’t get medals and obviously that looked like the British swimmers had underperformed,’ said Parry, ‘But there are over 200 countries that compete at the Olympics — it is incredibly competitive and Britain have never managed to get more than three medals since the mid-80s. So it wasn’t a disastrous Games for us. ‘But Glasgow is a massive opportunity to put that right. It’s still on home soil and that will be a benefit. There will be a great deal of energy in there and it’s up to the athletes to feed off that and fulfil their potential.’ Jamieson will lead the charge in the 200m breaststroke. His Olympic final, where he came second behind Hungary’s Daniel Gyurta, was screened live at Parkhead before his beloved Celtic’s European clash with HJK Helsinki that same night. He will take centre stage on Thursday evening when the action gets underway. Form: Jamieson, right, poses with Ross Murdoch and Adam Peaty after the British Championships . Formidable: Jamieson competes at Tollcross for European Allstars in December last year . Swimming legend Mark Foster says Jamieson will be aiming for a world record. ‘He’s got the body to do it, he’s got the ability to do it, he’s got the mind to do it,’ Foster said, with Jamieson’s PB standing at 2:07.43mins — just 0.42seconds outside the world record. ‘There’s no reason why he can’t do it. Jamieson might have to break the world record to win gold, such is the quality of the field. Australian Christian Sprenger, the Olympic silver medallist in the 100m, will be a threat as will the Scot’s training partner, Englishman Andrew Willis. If Jamieson can win gold, it could the pave the way for further glory in the years to come, with the Rio Olympics just two years down the line. Given that Adlington, now retired, won over half of Team GB’s swimming medals at the last two Olympics, British Swimming could struggle in Brazil. But Adlington thinks it’s back on the right track. Faith in British Swimming: Steve Parry and Rebecca Adlington think performances will improve in Glasgow . ‘I don’t see the amount of medals in Rio being hugely different because we have never won more than three, it’s predicting the colour that’s hard,’ said Adlington, who was speaking at an Everyone Active, Fit For Sport and Legacy Games Day. ‘Michael Jamieson is likely to still be up there and there are good youngsters coming through. To have something like the Commonwealth Games is such an amazing stepping stone so hopefully there’ll be a roll-on effect. We’re definitely in a better place than we have been in a long time. ‘My old coach Bill Furniss is now Head Coach and Chris Spice is Performance Director. We should have had them for the last ten years. We’ve been attempting to replicate America and Australia, now we’ve got our own plan. ‘Let’s not follow, let’s lead.’","Jamieson finished second in the 200m breaststroke at London 2012 .

The 24-year-old sustained the injury in the 100 metres at the Glasgow Grand Prix on July 11. Taken away: Yohan Blake left the track in a wheelchair after injuring his hamstring . Spectator: Blake had to watch the rest of the race from the floor . 'Right now he's on crutches, he had to have an operation a couple of days ago,' coach Mills said on Tuesday. 'The injury was quite severe and the original prognosis was misdiagnosed. 'He went to Germany and when they had a good look, they realised that it was more serious and required surgery, so he'll be out for quite a long time.' Blake, who could not defend his 100m world title in Moscow last year because of a hamstring injury, had opted against racing at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow starting on Wednesday to concentrate on his build-up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

"By . Mike Dawes . Zoe Smith is relishing the prospect of an England-Wales battle for gold with childhood inspiration Michaela Breeze at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. Smith, 20, bagged a bronze in Delhi four years ago to become England's first female Commonwealth Games medallist. Now she has her sights set on 58kg gold and thinks 34-year-old Breeze, who won gold in 2002 and 2006 and came out of retirement to compete at Glasgow 2014, is the main obstacle in her path. Excited: Zoe Smith is relishing an England-Wales battle for gold at the Commonwealth Games . Champ: Smith has her sights on 58kg gold and thinks Breeze is her main obstacle to achieve it . 'I think the gold may potentially be between myself and Michaela,' said Smith. 'I like Michaela. When I was young she was a bit of an idol for me and going head to head with her will be very exciting. There's no animosity between the two of us. It's a friendly Games and, if I don't win, I'd want her to.' Smith had a spell out through injury in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics but is firing on all cylinders again now and is enjoying training under new coach Sam Dovey. 'I've been working very well with him. He believes I've got a chance to perform really well here and so do I,' she said. 'I'm a little bit nervous because body weight isn't going down the way I kind of I hoped it would but, other than that, everything is really good. 'I'm feeling well prepared and training well. Now I've just got to go out there and do what I usually do.' Smith admits there are a lot of similarities between her Games debut in Delhi and that of 15-year-old schoolgirl team-mate Rebekah Tiler, who competes at 69kg. 'She's a similar age and she'll have the same kind do expectations and pressure from team-mates and the general public but I'm sure she will perform,' said Smith. 'I feel a lot more experienced this time. I'm four years older, I would say four years wiser too but I guess that' s up for debate!' Tiler seems remarkably unfazed at the prospect of stepping into the Commonwealth Games spotlight. Competition: Michaela Breeze could stand in Smith's way to a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games . In Smith's way: One highlight of the Commonwealth Games could be a potential head to head in Glasgow . 'Things are going good, I'm training hard,' she said. 'I'm not nervous now, I think it will hit me on the day when I'm on the platform. 'I'll have plenty of support though. My family, my neighbours, friends and teachers.' Smith may have more experience under her belt this time round but she still gets nervous and feels that often works to her advantage. 'I'm always a nervous wreck,' she said. 'I'm always nervous about everything. I do get the adrenaline kick and sometimes it will keep me up at night. 'The adrenaline will kick in after the weigh-in and when you're warming up. I find it's often a good thing to be honest. I can be warming up in the back room and feeling a bit heavy but then get out on the platform and the weights are flying.' Smith, who had her funding cut by British Weightlifting shortly after her Delhi bronze because the governing body felt she was overweight, is confident that she, and other women lifters, are helping to make the sport more appealing for women. 'I think there's less of a stigma around it now,' she added. 'Lifting weights is becoming more of a normal thing for women to do. It's becoming a lot more fashionable so ideally we can be an inspiration to breaking down the social stigma around it. If the guys can do it, why can't the girls?' Ready? Smith admits she still becomes 'a nervous wreck' but works it to her advantage when competing . Meanwhile British record holder Jack Oliver (77kg) is expecting a tight battle for the medals in his class. 'I'm in good shape and I think there will only be a couple of kilos between first and fifth in 77kg,' he said. 'That should make it a good competition to watch. It's harder if you're in it knowing one lift will make the difference between first and fourth but we do want weightlifting to be exciting. 'You get people coming to the Games who haven't seen weightlifting live before and I think they find it pretty impressive when they see what the women and men are capable of lifting above their heads and the speed of it. It's not something you see every day.'","Zoe Smith on 58kg category at Commonwealth Games: 'I think the gold may potentially be between myself and Michaela (Breeze)'

"By . Euan Crumley . When it comes to race day, Katie Archibald likes to be organised. From what time she awakes, to when she will eat and warm up, no stone is left unturned. It’s not a surprise then to hear that everything - right down to the colour she will dye her trademark technicolour hairstyle - has been planned ahead of her return to the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. Recent preparations have been made at the Team GB base in Manchester and an excursion to France for some outdoor velodrome racing with Laura Trott. Going for gold: Katie Archibald is competing in five events at the Commonwealth Games for Team Scotland . All bases covered: Archibald will race both on the track and the road as she looks for glory in Glasgow . After being prepared for the impending competition, however, the arena which bears the name of one of Scotland’s favourite sons and the most decorated British Olympian ever is reopening its doors - and the 20-year-old from Milngavie admits that only when she reaches home and dons the Scotland colours again will she start to realise how far she has come and what she is about to do. Archibald is no longer the unknown running rings around the opposition on grass tracks at the Highland Games, she’s a reigning World and European team pursuit champion who has more than justified her place with the elite British squad. This is a star in the making who, with five chances of striking gold at Glasgow 2014 - on the track she will contest the 3,000m individual pursuit, points race and scratch race, whilst she will also hit the streets to tackle the time trial and road race - stands every chance of becoming a national hero. An intriguing subplot reveals itself when asking her to assess her medal chances, however. As part of her everyday life, Archibald trains with the rest of Team GB in Manchester and that was still the case as recently as last Thursday when she was ‘doing team pursuit training as a GB squad, so that’s in the background’. Familiar faces: Archibald (left) will face World and European team pursuit gold medal team-mates Laura Trott (second right), who will represent Team England, and Elinor Barker (second left) who will represent Wales . Competition: World and European team-mates Trott (left) and Barker (right) will be Archibald's rivals . Her team-mates, such as English double Olympic champion Trott, and Welsh flatmate Elinor Barker, will be the competition. ‘I’ve got to feel good,’ says Archibald of the mission which lies ahead. ‘With the pursuit, it’s kind of odd that I’m training with some of the English girls and some of the Welsh girls and we’re all aware of the splits that everyone is doing. ‘I think we’re kind of ranking each other in our heads - and it’s close! I don’t know which way it’s going to go and, with the Aussies and the Kiwis, all we can work off is PBs. It’s going to be a tight cluster, with some close times. ‘Because we are all going well, I think it would be a bit awkward and tense if there was a clear disparity between us and it was obvious that someone was getting well beaten, but that’s not the case. ‘It’s all good competition. Nobody’s thinking: “Oh, I’m way ahead” and nobody’s getting angry, thinking: “Oh God, I’m really not going well”. It’s healthy but when we split and we’re all in our little pens, then I think you’ll get a few people taking sneaky splits and seeing what other people are doing!’ Closely-fought: Archibald is experienced and expects there to be a lot of tough competition in Glasgow . That’s not to suggest Archibald feels she has anything to fear. In fact, she has every intention of embracing any pressure which falls on her young shoulders. ‘I don’t think anyone loves that horrible feeling you get in your stomach, but I see the use of it,’ she continues. ‘I wouldn’t shy away from people talking about success because obviously I want to win. ‘Whether that’s realistic or not, it’s the attitude you’ve got to go to the start line with, so it would be fairly hypocritical if I turned round and tried to calm people and say: “Don’t go saying I’m going to get medals”. ‘When I was younger, I used to do that with my mum. I would tell her to be quiet because she’d lift you up so that you’re on top of the world and tell you you’re amazing and I didn’t deal well with it. I think, this time around, if people believe in me then that’s good. Patriotic: Archibald is proud to represent Team Scotland and will give her all for her nation in Glasgow . ‘I’ve got my mum, my dad, my gran and my brother coming (to the velodrome). I took my dad to a World Cup once and he got bored and left halfway through, so I’ m hoping there won’t be a repeat!’ With such a packed schedule, which encompasses the entirety of the Games, there will be little chance for Archibald to take stock or dwell on any achievements. ‘It’s not the British way, I don’t have time for reflection,’ she laughs. ‘I think we’re always looking for the next goal and the next target. ‘I guess the ultimate reward would be the Olympics, wouldn’t it, and the Commonwealths will have that same feel to it. I think, after this big event, it will be a test of whether I can embrace some success afterwards.’ Famous face: The track cycling at the Games will take place in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome .","Archibald will compete in five cycling events for Team Scotland in Glasgow .

"By . Mike Dawes . Sir Bradley Wiggins has revealed he will remain at Team Sky next season in order to target Paris-Roubaix and the Hour Record, but said he does not expect to return to the Tour de France. With his contract up at the end of the season, Wiggins' future has been the subject of much speculation since Sky team principal Sir Dave Brailsford chose to leave the 2012 Tour winner out of the squad for this year's race - a decision brought under renewed focus when the defending champion Chris Froome was forced to withdraw on stage five. Scroll down for video . Sky's the limit: Bradley Wiggins has confirmed he will sign a new deal with Team Sky . Absent: Wiggins was left out of the team for this year's Tour de France . VIDEO Wiggins in Team Sky talks . But in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport at a sponsor's event in Italy, Wiggins said he planned to sign a new deal with Sky. 'It's true, I'm thinking about it (the Hour Record),' Wiggins said. 'Not this year but I'll try next year. And I'll do it on these bikes because I'm going to stay at Sky. 'My time as a Grand Tour rider is over. I'll still ride them but not to win them. I'll sign up now for this event next year. If Sky doesn't take me to the Tour, I'll be back.' It has been reported that Wiggins will sign a contract until 2016 with Team Sky. He had been linked with a move to either Orica-GreenEdge or Garmin-Sharp if he had moved on. Wiggins is due to ride for England at the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in July and also told Gazzetta he plans to ride in the Vuelta a Espana - a race which has also been mentioned as a possible comeback for Froome after injury forced to him to quit the Tour, perhaps setting up another edition of the long-standing drama regarding the relationship between the two Tour winners.'

"By . Euan Crumley . His first outing on Hampden’s glistening new track could hardly have gone better, but Chris O’Hare still wasn’t completely happy with his performance. ‘I can’t be mad with it because it was a personal best, but if I’d held back a bit on the back straight and really gone for it with 200 metres to go then I think I could have maybe gone 3.33 high/3.34 low,’ he says of his 1,500m display at the Glasgow Grand Prix meeting, which saw him finish fifth in a time of 3:35.06. Such is life when you’re a young athlete looking to scale new heights in front of an expectant home crowd in the biggest event of your career. Going for gold: Chris O'Hare will compete for Team Scotland in the 1,500m at the Commonwealth Games . Cycling innovator Sir Dave Brailsford calls them ‘marginal gains’, the tiny details which can all add up to a huge performance. As O’Hare gears up for Glasgow 2014, he’s all too aware of just how important even the smallest of changes can be. ‘I always seem to come out of a season thinking: “If I’d done something a wee bit different, I could have maybe run a second faster”,’ he admits. ‘I’m the least patient person when it comes to running. ‘Patience is key, though, over the 1,500m as you only get one or two moves and, if you do them at the wrong time, then you’re out of luck. I need to be a bit more patient in a championship setting. ‘I’m happy with where I’m at physically and I just have a couple of things I need to tune up. I need to get my head sorted out and prepare myself for being patient, basically. ‘At the Diamond League, I got excited and went for it with 300m to go because the crowd were going crazy and I thought: “I’m just going for it”. But that’s then probably the biggest lesson I’ll take away from it - to not let the crowd influence my moves.’ Familiar: O'Hare ran at Hampden Park in the Diamond League meeting and earned a personal best . The final stages of ‘tuning up’ will take place largely at Team Scotland’s athletics base in Kilmarnock, where the 23-year-old from West Linton will join up with a squad which clearly means business. As a sign of their growing strength, seven Scots - including O’Hare and fellow 1,500m runner Jake Wightman - have been included in the Great Britain squad for next month’s European Championships. ‘I remember saying this time last year that British athletes in general have really stepped their game up,’ continues O’Hare. ‘They knew that Glasgow was what they wanted to do and that’s what they’ve put all of their efforts into. Everyone has done a good job of preparing themselves. ‘This is by far the strongest Scotland team that I’ve seen going to a Commonwealth Games - and by far the most professional. ‘I’m excited to go to Glasgow and be part of that team that has expectations and nobody’s scared to say: “I want to be in the final”. That’s great to see. Company: O'Hare will be joined on the track by fellow Scottish 1,500m runner Jake Wightman . ‘Yes, it’s going to be great being in Hampden but we’re looking to that as an inspiration to go above and beyond what’s expected of us.’ O’Hare was hugely impressed by his first visit to the home of Scottish football in its current guise as an athletics arena, but it wasn’t the only thing with a Caledonian background to have caught his attention. The 20-year-old Wightman was on his shoulder at the finish line and O’Hare could not be more enthusiastic about the ‘Scottish 1,500m force’ which is beginning to emerge. ‘He’s three years younger than me, so to see him running that time was fantastic,’ he adds. ‘He’s a massively talented guy and he’s raced a lot this year and, at that age, that’s sometimes what you need to do. ‘He qualified outright for the Commonwealths and he’s qualified comfortably for the Europeans. It’s exciting to be part of a Scottish 1,500m force that is coming through and, more importantly, a massive step up in British 1,500m running.’ Celtic: Seven Scottish athletes have been included in Great Britain's squad for the European Championships . Provided everything goes to plan, O’Hare’s big moment will come on the last night of the athletics competition in Glasgow. It’s the same session in which Usain Bolt is expected to run for Jamaica in the 4 x100m relay, so the recipe of a world superstar strutting his stuff and a Scottish hope aiming to medal could be something for a capacity crowd to feast on. As you would expect from someone so focused, however, O’Hare is not getting ahead of himself. ‘Yes, that’s if I make the final, which is the first step on the agenda,’ he says. ‘When you go and have a good run and you’re down the back straight with someone like Silas Kiplagat, everybody steps their expectations up for you. ‘It’s a fantastic opportunity and I think everybody will be thinking: “I don’t want to look back when I retire and think I could have done a whole lot better in Glasgow”. Excited: O'Hare is looking forward to running in front of an expectant home crowd at Glasgow's Hampden Park .","O'Hare was not happy with his first taste of the Hampden Park track despite running a 1,500m personal best of 3:35.06 and finish fifth in a high-class field .

The Championship club were forced to cancel a trip to La Manga due to a shortage of players, and there has been speculation that manager Jose Riga is ready to quit the club in protest at the mess. Blackpool begin the new season on August 9 at Nottingham Forest and will be forced to sign a raft of new players before then if they are going to be competitive.

Nathan Delfouneso, Faris Haroun, Elliott Grandin, Martin Cranie, Jacob Mellis and Angel Martinez and former Tottenham goalkeeper Ben Alnwick are believed to be among the trialists. Chairman Karl Oyston downplayed the situation, claiming a number of new players were set to arrive at the club. He told the club's official website: “I see absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be able to recruit sufficient numbers and quality to be able to compete in The Championship. The main thing people want to see is players signing for us and I think once we get some signed, and everything settles down, then we’ll soon forget about some of the problems. 'We’re finding it difficult to land some of the players we’ve been chasing. That’s always the case, but unfortunately it’s with backdrop of not having many players, so it probably focuses things a little more than would normally be the case.' Blackpool quickly took a 3-0 lead against Penrith thanks to two goals from trialist Delfouneso and one from Sergei Zenjov.

The Blackpool winger, who has been on loan at Crystal Palace since January, is weighing up several offers from clubs across Europe.

Inter Milan have admitted their interest in signing Blackpool winger Tom Ince . Making waves: Ince has been on loan at Crystal Palace from Blackpool since the January transfer window . Ince is 22, meaning that even though he is available on a free transfer, any club wanting to sign him would have to pay the Seasiders some compensation via a tribunal. That figure would be in the millions if a Premier League side agreed a move, but severely reduced if Ince were to go abroad, where he may command a fee of just £155,000. 'He's a young player with an expiring contract who is weighing up several offers,' Ausilio said on Saturday. 'It's definitely not a done deal for Ince.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton spearheaded another one-two for Mercedes in practice, but Daniel Ricciardo is threatening to spoil the German manufacturing giant's party on home soil. It was a close run thing between the two championship protagonists as Hamilton finished just 0.024 seconds clear of German team-mate Nico Rosberg following the two 90-minute sessions at a hot Hockenheim ahead of the German Grand Prix. In scorching temperatures of 32 degrees centigrade, and with the track thermometer hitting a searing 58, Hamilton finished with a time of one minute 18.341 seconds after finally getting to grips with the circuit and the loss of FRIC. VIDEO Scroll down to ride on board with Lewis Hamilton around the German GP circuit . Getting ready: Lewis Hamilton was fastest in the second session as he bids to secure back-to-back wins . Hiding? The 29-year-old Briton topped the timesheets in the final session on Friday at Hockenheim . Ahead of this race FIA race director Charlie Whiting caused a stir amongst the teams by sending a letter threatening to outlaw the front and rear interconnected (FRIC) device. FRIC enables the cars to maintain a constant ride height, and is believed to have played a role in Mercedes' dominance so far this season. Following a detailed investigation of most of the systems, Whiting felt FRIC contravenes one of the FIA's catch-all regulations with regard to moveable aerodynamic devices. In fear of a rival launching a protest, the FIA confirmed all teams had opted to remove the device prior to practice. Home advantage: Nico Rosberg takes to the Hockenheim circuit ahead of the German Grand Prix . On the ball: Rosberg enjoys a spot of keepy-up before getting into his car for the morning's first session . On track it was immediately apparent as to its benefits as a number of cars ran wide in the slow corners due to them being forced to run a higher, stiffer front suspension. The Mercedes' of Rosberg and Hamilton were high amongst those who suffered difficulties during the first session, in particular the latter. Hamilton was comfortably fastest in the opening two sectors, but in the third was off the pace, and so had to settle for second best behind Rosberg. Come FP2, and after getting used to the new feel of the car, the 29-year-old hit back to narrowly pip Rosberg, who is aiming to complete the best week of his life. Rosberg, who over the past few days has got married, watched Germany win the World Cup and signed a new long-term deal with Mercedes, is determined to land victory in front of his fans. Ricciardo, however, may yet throw a spanner in the works as the Red Bull driver finished just a tenth of a second adrift, as close as anyone has got to Mercedes at the end of Friday practice. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, fit again after damaging ribs and sustaining bruising following his heavy-impact shunt into a barrier on the first lap of the British Grand Prix a fortnight ago, was a distant fourth, half a second down. Kevin Magnussen - driving a McLaren sporting a new rear wing - and Felipe Massa for Williams were both over 0.6secs adrift, followed by Jenson Button in his McLaren, with the Briton 0.880secs off the pace. Life in the fast lane: Ricciardo finished third in final practice on Friday. He has impressed for Red Bull this term . Button was in good company as he was followed by two other world champions in Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. After a successful practice outing for Williams development driver Susie Wolff in FP1, Valtteri Bottas returned to the car for FP2 and was a second adrift in 10th. Wolff, meanwhile, conjured a strong performance in FP1, finishing only a quarter of a second behind Massa, although was handed two fines for pitlane speeding. There was also an electrical glitch on her opening installation lap that threatened to scupper the 31-year-old Scot's outing, which would have been an injustice given an engine issue ruined her maiden run at Silverstone after just four laps. Marussia's Max Chilton finished 3.5secs behind Hamilton in 21st, with Kamui Kobayashi propping up the timesheet after his Caterham caught fire out on track.","Hamilton was marginally quicker than F1 title rival Rosberg in practice .

"By . Mark Prigg . An ancestor of the elephant once believed to have disappeared from North America before humans ever arrived there roamed the continent longer than previously thought – and was hunted by early man. Archaeologists have discovered artifacts of the prehistoric Clovis culture mingled with the bones of two gomphotheres – an ancient ancestor of the elephant – at an archaeological site in northwestern Mexico. The discovery suggests that the Clovis – the earliest widespread group of hunter-gatherers to inhabit North America – likely hunted and ate gomphotheres. These sculptures, made by Mexican artist Sergio de la Rosa, show three elephant ancestors: (from left to right) the mastodon, the mammoth and the gomphothere. Archaeologists have discovered artifacts of the prehistoric Clovis culture mingled with the bones of two gomphotheres ¿ an ancient ancestor of the elephant ¿ at an archaeological site in northwestern Mexico. Gomphotheres were smaller than mammoths – about the same size as modern elephants. They once were widespread in North America, but until now they seemed to have disappeared from the continent's fossil record long before humans arrived in North America, which happened some 13,000 to 13,500 years ago, during the late Ice Age. However, the bones that Holliday and his colleagues uncovered date back 13,400 years, making them the last known gomphotheres in North America. Beginning about 5 million years ago, they were gradually replaced by modern elephants . The members of the Clovis culture were already well-known as hunters of the gomphotheres' cousins, mammoths and mastodons. Although humans were known to have hunted gomphotheres in Central America and South America, this is the first time a human-gomphothere connection has been made in North America, says archaeologist Vance Holliday of the University of Arizona, who co-authored a new paper on the findings, published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 'This is the first archaeological gomphothere found in North America, and it's the only one known,' said Holliday, a professor of anthropology and geology at the UA. Holliday and colleagues from the U.S. and Mexico began excavating the skeletal remains of two juvenile gomphotheres in 2007 after ranchers alerted them that the bones had been found in northwestern Sonora, Mexico. They admit they didn't know at first what kind of animal they were dealing with. 'At first, just based on the size of the bone, we thought maybe it was a bison, because the extinct bison were a little bigger than our modern bison,' Holliday said. Then, in 2008, they discovered a jawbone with teeth, buried upside down in the dirt. 'We finally found the mandible, and that's what told the tale,' Holliday said. Gomphotheres were smaller than mammoths – about the same size as modern elephants. A clear quartz Clovis point found near the bone bed at El Fin del Mundo. Although very difficult to shape into a tool, quartz was used by Clovis tool makers at several sites. They once were widespread in North America, but until now they seemed to have disappeared from the continent's fossil record long before humans arrived in North America, which happened some 13,000 to 13,500 years ago, during the late Ice Age. However, the bones that Holliday and his colleagues uncovered date back 13,400 years, making them the last known gomphotheres in North America. The gomphothere remains weren't all Holliday and his colleagues unearthed at the site, which they dubbed El Fin del Mundo – Spanish for The End of the World – because of its remote location. As their excavation of the bones progressed, they also uncovered numerous Clovis artifacts, including signature Clovis projectile points, or spear tips, as well as cutting tools and flint flakes from stone tool-making. The Clovis culture is so named for its distinctive stone tools, first discovered by archaeologists near Clovis, New Mexico, in the 1930s. Radiocarbon dating, done at the UA, puts the El Fin del Mundo site at about 13,400 years old, making it one of the two oldest known Clovis sites in North America; the other is the Aubrey Clovis site in north Texas. The position and proximity of Clovis weapon fragments relative to the gomphothere bones at the site suggest that humans did in fact kill the two animals there. A Gomphothere mandible in place, upside down, at El Fin del Mundo excavation site. The bones the bones uncovered date back 13,400 years, making them the last known gomphotheres in North America. Of the seven Clovis points found at the site, four were in place among the bones, including one with bone and teeth fragments above and below. The other three points had clearly eroded away from the bone bed and were found scattered nearby. 'This is the first Clovis gomphothere, it's the first archaeological gomphothere found in North America, it's the first evidence that people were hunting gomphotheres in North America, and it adds another item to the Clovis menu,' Holliday said.","Archaeologists have Clovis arrowheads  mingled with the bones of two gomphotheres in northwestern Mexico .

"By . Sam Webb . The grim reality of Britain's housing crisis has been laid bare by these pictures of the slum-like conditions endured by the most desperate people in UK society. For just £20 per week, migrant workers and jobless locals live in 'beds in sheds' - windowless garages and outhouses turned into an austere living space. The images were taken in the Whetley Hill area of Bradford, West Yorkshire, by a builder who was horrified that people are forced to live in such a degrading manner. The slum that shames Britain: These pictures, taken in Bradford by a builder in the Whetley Hill area of the West Yorkshire city, show the grim conditions endured by the most desperate people in the UK who are living in converted sheds and garages . One of the pictures shows a mattress on . the floor of a breeze-block shack, with a bucket acting as a toilet, The . resident's paltry possessions are seen on metal shelves lined with . newspaper. The builder, who was told the occupant is an Eastern European immigrant who sells scrap metal, told the Daily Star Sunday: 'It beggars belief that someone can be so desperate that they would live like this. 'Surely his life back home can’t have been any worse than sleeping on a mattress in a breeze-block shack in Bradford. I’m told he is paying £20 a week for this.' A mattress on the floor of a breeze-block shack, next to a bucket that acts as a toilet. The resident's paltry possessions are seen on metal shelves lined with newspaper . The rickety dwellings are a stark contrast to the upmarket Saltaire area of the city, where properties can sell for upwards of £250,000. The scourge of these often rickety, cramped and unhygienic buildings looks set to grow as the country struggles to accommodate the huge numbers of immigrants arriving here – both legally and illegally. But some authorities are fighting back. Officials in Harrow, north-west London used an aircraft equipped with a thermal camera to fly over the borough to pinpoint the illegal structures. 'The beds-in-sheds phenomenon means there is a hidden community springing up in the back gardens of our cities - in our borough alone the thermal pictures we receive suggest there are four times as many as we first suspected,' said Susan Hall, the Conservative leader of Harrow council at the time. 'The pressures of migration in London, fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from eastern Europe, are creating new stresses on local authorities that we just haven't had to contend with before. 'What was once thought, even just 18 months ago, to be a problem for the centre of big cities is now rippling out to the suburbs.' She added: 'These are people who use council services - like bin collection - but for whom we receive no extra funding.' Earlier this year, Ealing Council estimated that the inhabitants of beds in sheds has pushed the area’s population up by 60,000 to nearly 400,000. David Shepherd, Bradford Council’s Assistant Director for Housing, Employment and Skills, said Bradford Council has received no complaints about sub-standard accommodation of thew type in the Whetley Hill area. He added: 'Standards in rented property are governed by the Housing Act 2004 which gives Local Authorities powers of enforcement to deal with sub-standard accommodation. 'If we discover people living in the conditions described we would use enforcement powers to prevent the use of the property and prosecute any person who failed to comply with a Prohibition Order. 'A Landlord could face a fine of up to £5,000 for breaching the order. 'Bradford Council would be happy to investigate these allegations and would appreciate further details on the location of these properties.' The occupant of this shack, believed to be an Eastern European selling scrap metal, pays £20 a week rent . Refuse: When the occupant's move out, landlords often simply dump the mattress on the street . The houses are a stark contrast to the upmarket Saltaire area of the city, where properties can sell for upwards of £250,000 .

"By . Emma Thomas . This is no child's play - an intricate sculptor has spent hours creating iconic characters of television and film out of crayons . Hoang Tran, from California, USA, left dentistry school to become an artist creating these amazing mini masterpieces. From a bride and groom carved in miniature detail to the sigils of all the houses from the Game of Thrones TV series, Mr Tran has recreated their likenesses perfectly. Skill: Hoang Tran (pictured here with some of his crayon creations) painstakingly creates miniature masterpieces from the crayons. The sculptures include well-know film and television characters . Adventure Time: Characters from the popular Cartoon Network cartoon series have been carved in their corresponding colours .

Use the force: Star Wars characters are intricately carved out of the tiny crayons . Every minute detail of the figures is painstakingly recreated in the children's colouring sticks. The 28-year-old says he owes all his skill to his dentistry training and tools his still uses every day. He said: 'I had a lot of experience carving wax, in dental school we had to learn how to carve wax teeth for the fabrication of gold crowns. 'Depending on the difficulty of what I'm trying to carve, it takes me about two to three hours to mostly finish one - a lot shorter than when I first started.

"By . Alex Gore . A mother has told how her son wrote a suicide note on the back of a bank letter demanding the repayment of his £3,000 overdraft. Toby Thorn, 23, took his life after racking up the overdraft on top of a £5,000 student debt. On the reverse of a letter from Barclays, he wrote simply: ‘Thank you to all my friends I appreciate all your support, Later ANON.’ His body was found soon afterwards. Beloved: Anne Thorn has become a trustee of Papyrus following the death of her son Toby . Yesterday his mother Anne said she had no idea her son was so anxious about his financial situation. Toby had dropped out of a degree . course in computing in his third year and was hoping to start a . business. But as he moved into a flat with friends, he was apparently . agonising over his £8,000 debts. Single mother Mrs Thorn, 56, said: ‘Young people can’t find jobs, so they can’t see a way out of debt. 'It’s unbearable to think that Toby didn’t know how much he was loved.’ Determined: Anne wants to help other young people with financial worries . Debt: Paperwork shows Toby Thorn's £3,000 overdraft and outstanding student loan . An inquest ruled that Toby’s debt was a major contributory factor in his suicide. Mrs Thorn said: ‘He said university . just wasn’t for him, so we looked at other options. I had no idea his . debts were bothering him so much. I don’t believe that’s the only reason . why he took his own life but it must have been a big contributing . factor. ‘People don’t realise that suicide is . so common in young people, especially young men. Men  don’t talk about . their feelings. They keep it all bottled up which can lead to . depression.’ According to a YouGov poll, money was . the most common worry across the UK last year, and calls to the . Samaritans’ helpline about financial concerns have doubled in the past . three years. Following her son’s death in  July . last year, Mrs Thorn, a customer relations officer, became a trustee for . the charity Papyrus, which aims to prevent suicide in the young. Statistics released by the charity . show that around 1,400 under-35s kill themselves in the UK every year, . and three-quarters are men. Mrs Thorn said: ‘It is a national . scandal that the Government is not doing more. Although they have . promised £1million for research, there is no action and no . implementation plan.

"By . Vanessa Allen . Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson arrives at the Old Bailey in London today. He has denied claims from a former colleague that he was there when a phone message from Sienna Miller to Daniel Craig was played . Andy Coulson had meetings with four Cabinet ministers on the day he supposedly listened to a hacked voicemail, he told his trial yesterday. The former News of the World editor insisted his busy diary meant he could not have heard a message in which actress Sienna Miller told James Bond star Daniel Craig: 'I love you'. Journalist Dan Evans had told the hacking trial he played the message to Coulson in the tabloid's newsroom in London and claimed the editor ordered a cover-up to allow the newspaper to expose the affair without revealing its illegal source. But Coulson, who later became David Cameron's communications chief, flatly denied hearing the tape and said the newspaper had legitimate sources for the scoop about Miss Miller, who was engaged to the actor Jude Law at the time. These sources included one of Law's relatives and his film publicist. He told the jury about the alleged incident in the newspaper offices, in Wapping, east London, saying: 'Andy came over and wanted to hear the tape. 'Certainly Andy was there. I played him the tape a couple of times and listened to it. 'I was over there playing the tape and Andy was standing next to me.' Evans, 38, has also claimed that Coulson knew about his activities and told him a voicemail he taped from Ms Miller to Mr Craig exposing their alleged affair was 'brilliant'. Coulson denied ever being aware that convicted hacker Glenn Mulcaire - who had . been employed by the now-defunct Sunday tabloid - was illegally . listening in to voicemail messages. Love triangle: Jude Law and Sienna Miller pictured together with Daniel Craig in North London in 2004 . He also hit out at the claim that he had 'bullied' co-defendant and former colleague Clive Goodman. Coulson, giving evidence for a fourth day in the phone-hacking trial at the Old Bailey, said Evans’ account was wrong. His counsel, Timothy Langdale QC, asked Coulson: 'Dan Evans told the court that in September 2005 there was an occasion when he played to you a voicemail message left on Daniel Craig’s telephone by Sienna Miller. Did any such incident take place?' The defendant replied: 'No, it did not.' The notes of Coulson's PA from September 27, 2005, the day he is accused of listening to the voicemail, show he met with cabinet ministers Alan Milburn, Jack Straw, Charles Clarke, and Tessa Jowell, before listening to Prime Minister Tony Blair's keynote speech. He then attended a News International party in the evening, after several days of networking at the conference. 'I can remember meeting these people in Brighton', he said. 'I'm pretty sure I went to Blair's speech.' Journalist Dan Evans also claimed that Coulson knew about his phone hacking activities . Coulson said he could not remember having any specific dealings with Evans - who the tabloid recruited in January 2005 - during their time on the paper, but said they may have spoken. He told the court: 'I am sure we would have spoken to each other. 'If a new member of staff arrives I would normally make the point of saying hello and having a chat with them. 'I am sure that happened, but none (conversations) stick in my memory.' Coulson said his personal involvement as editor with stories and the reporters 'varied'. He said: 'There was no hard and fast set of rules in the way the story was researched and prepared.' Coulson, 46, of Charing, Kent, is charged with conspiring to hack phones with Rebekah Brooks and former managing editor Stuart Kuttner, and conspiring with former royal editor Clive Goodman to commit misconduct in a public office. All seven defendants deny all charges against them. Coulson also said he was aware of three contacts held by journalists on the NotW in relation to Sienna Miller and her then-partner Jude Law. In an email to Coulson, he is told the paper had 'good inside knowledge' from the 'camp' of Ms Miller's stepmother, Dragon's Den star Kelly Hoppen, and credited Evans with making 'special checks' on the story. Coulson told the court: 'Good inside stuff from Kelly Hoppen's camp is a clear indication he had got some sources, or a source . 'Special checks"" doesn't mean anything to me at all, but all reporters think their checks are special.' Their identities were not disclosed in court, though it has already been reported that a relative of Mr Law had been supplying information about the British actor. At an earlier hearing the court heard that Law was caught having a fling with nanny Daisy Wright before Miss Miller’s affair with Craig in 2005. Miss Miller said she had been through a ‘difficult’ time and she turned to Craig, one of her closest . friends, for comfort. She . said: ‘I think the thing that’s been slightly misconstrued about this . voicemail message is that I said “I love you”... I always ended my phone . calls with him with “I love you”, just like I did with all my friends . and family. ‘Whether I was or was not in a relationship with Daniel Craig - it was never a relationship, it was a very brief encounter. ‘He . was my best friend. Me saying “I love you” – whether anything romantic . had happened briefly or not – that was always the way I communicated . with him, whether Jude was present or not. 'It’s been turned into this . titillating piece of information.’ All three contacts were in the 'Jude Law camp', Coulson said. He added: 'People in and around celebrities - their relatives, their agents, their PRs - will talk to newspapers.' He . said he had asked staff working on the story not to refer to Mr Law as . either a 'sex addict' or a 'love rat' in copy due to the paper’s . relationship with sources in his camp. He said he also believed Mr Law was aware that some of those close to him were talking to the press. Former News International Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks arrives at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court in London today . Asked . by Mr Langdale if there was anything to suggest information contained . in memos for Coulson by his reporters had been obtained by illegal . hacking, he replied: 'No, not at all.' Coulson said the NotW’s front page exclusive about Ms Miller and Mr Craig had come in the same week in 2005 when he had been busy overseeing a serialisation of British boxer Frank Bruno’s biography. He told the court: 'It was a long, complicated book serialisation. I remember the publishers insisted on making changes quite late in the day, and I think the lawyers were involved as well. 'It took up a lot of my time.' Responding to suggestions earlier in the trial that he had bullied then-NotW royal editor Goodman by demoting him and reducing his responsibilities, Coulson said: 'I’m not a bully. 'If I made a remark in conference or said something - it’s a newspaper, that happens - I would apologise for it. 'I did nothing to undermine or attack Clive Goodman.' Last week, Coulson admitted he had been played hacked voicemails left by Home Secretary David Blunkett for his married lover in 2004. He said he initially demanded the paper's chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck cease his investigation into the politician as it was a 'breach of privacy'. However, Coulson said he reconsidered the story when he heard Mr Blunkett discussing security issues and appearing distracted from his Cabinet role. Coulson quit as editor of the News of the World in January 2007 after the convictions of Royal editor Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking. Six months later, he was appointed director of communications and planning for the Conservative Party, retaining the post when David Cameron became Prime Minister. However, he was forced to resign over hacking again in January 2011, as the police investigation got under way.

"By . Alexandra Williams . Fans of Formula One legend Michael Schumacher have been warned that they will 'never have any good news' concerning his condition. Schumacher, 45, suffered a near-fatal head injury in a skiing accident in Meribel, France, on December 29 last year. It has been two months since the family relayed any information on the tragic sportsman’s health. Scroll down for video . Gary Hartstein,  left, F1 sport's chief doctor between . 2005 and 2012, said:  'I'm quite afraid (and virtually certain) we will never have any good news about Michael' (pictured right) Their silence has led fans and commentators to fear the worst. Gary Hartstein, a former F1 doctor, said: 'I'm quite afraid (and virtually certain) we will never have any good news about Michael. 'At this point, I rather dread seeing that the family has put out a press release.' Writing on his blog, he added: 'I can conceive of no possible reason that Michael's entourage, understandably extremely protective of his and their privacy, would not tell his fans if significantly good things have happened.' Roger Benoit, a respected and long-serving member of the F1 media, said: 'Slowly, everybody is really worried. Grenoble and the family have been silent for weeks. Why?' Schumacher’s manager, Sabine Kehm, last issued a statement on April 4. It read: 'Michael is making progress on his way. He shows moments of consciousness and awakening. We are on his side during his long and difficult fight, together with the team of the hospital in Grenoble, and we keep remaining confident.' She has been criticized by some for failing to release more information but in the past she has said this is what he would want. She said: 'Michael Schumacher is in a coma and cannot decide what is reported about him. 'We, of course, know how he deals with such things and try in his interest to handle these matters for him.' Since these statements there has been no news. Corinna, with whom he has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside . This is the longest period of silence since the accident. It will be 23 weeks ago on Sunday that Schumacher suffered his life-threatening accident while skiing in Meribel, where he owns a chalet. Doctors began the process of gradually awakening him more than 18 weeks ago. Ms Kehm has said it is 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 'banal situation'. The accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in a small, rocky off-piste area. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son when he lost control after hitting a rock. He ended up smashing his head into a boulder 34 feet further down the mountain. He is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive care in Grenoble University Hospital. Corinna, with whom he has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. In February French investigators closed the official inquiry into his accident, ruling out any criminal wrongdoing.

"By . Deborah Arthurs At London Fashion Week . There is one word to sum up Julien Macdonald, and it's an obvious one, given that it's his favourite: fabulous. And that, as ever, is the best way to describe the Welsh designer's catwalk show. This is a man, after all, who has crystal balls in his kitchen and wears gold kaftans to Tesco (probably). His show today was a feast of glitter and glamour: gold gowns sprinkled with shimmering paillettes; chiffon dresses in palest oyster with sparkling silver mesh; backless pieces with sweeping trains and sheer cut-out sections revealing a glimpse of (beglittered) skin beneath. Scroll down for video . Showstoppers: Julien Macdonald's collection was, as ever, all about . metallics, high shine and unapologetic glamour. 'The people who buy my . clothes don't worry about money,' he said. 'They buy the best, they love . diamonds, jewellery.' CENTRE: Stand out: The leotard Pixie Lott was . eyeing up, saying, 'it would look amazing in a music video'. RIGHT: The collection was incredibly intricate and had taken hours to finesse . Hard work: Welsh designer Julien Macdonald says creating a collection is 'painful' - with hours of embroidery and sewing on beads - but the results are stunning . Feminine: Inspiration came during a friend's 40th birthday party in Marrakech, where Julien says he dressed in gold kaftan, gold slippers and wandered through the Souk, disregarding the laughter. 'I'm on my holidays, and if I want to wear a gold kaftan I will,' he said today . Spectacular:  Delicate lace and shimmering embellishment on chiffon were the order of the day . I loved a silver gown with crackled mirror finish; a long-sleeved, space-age sequin beauty with centre split and a chiffon dress with intricate blue and silver embroidery that looked to have been stitched by elves. Pixie Lott, who sat front row, loved a rather daring leotard made of nothing more than chiffon and some judiciously placed beads and sequins. 'It'd be amazing for a music video,' she said. Abbey Clancy, wearing Macdonald, said the entire show was 'amazing', but in particular she adored a long black macro-crochet dress. 'But if I go out in it I'll definitely wear underwear,' she says. After the show, which also saw Paloma Faith, Eliza Doolittle, Laura Whitmore, Pixie Lott and Melissa Odabash perch front row in JM designs, Julien said the show was inspired by a recent trip to Morocco. 'We all went to Marrakech for my friend's 40th birthday party,' he says, holding court among his Strictly pals - none of whom can rival him in the body glitter stakes. 'I was so inspired by the colours, the textiles, the flowers, the femininity. 'But I was even more inspired in the evening when people went home and changed into the most glamorous outfits they wanted and they partied the night away under a very exotic sky.' Glamour: A red carpet ready dress on the runway . Exotic: Macdonald says he was inspired by a trip to Morocco . Magical: The fairytale collection included lashings of silver mesh . 'Fabulous': Abbey Clancy said from the FROW that this black crochet dress was her favourite - but she'd be wearing it with underwear - while right, metallic embroidery elevated gowns into the spectacular . Recession proof: Julien says his customers are the sort who buy diamonds - they're not phased by the poor economy . Make-up, by Val Garland, was ethereal, like a tribe of exotic fairies on a big night out.Models' skin dazzled with a layer of gold glitter, their hair (by Martin Cullen at Streeters) slicked back. Shoes were by Gina (models were slipping on sliding on the Perspex floor: 'Whatever! They looked fab-u-lous', said Julien afterwards). Julien, being Julien, wore a showstopper, of course. 'I was actually wearing - you're going to love this - a gold kaftan, with a gold belt, a gold Moroccan slipper, and a little pochette. 'And I walked through the Souk to my friend's birthday party. They all thought I was mad and everybody laughed at me. 'But I thought, you know what? I don't care. I'm on my holidays, I'm in Morocco. If I want to wear a gold kaftan... and I did actually wear a gold kaftan. I did it. And I loved it.' So when can the rest of us get away with wearing showstoppers like Julien's? 'You know what?' he says with typical enthusiasm. 'Any time, any place, anywhere. Just have fun with fashion, enjoy it. Enjoy yourself and be a woman. So what?' For Julien though, while he may be the very embodiment of mischievous devil-may-care once the work is done, nothing about the planning for his show is 'so what'. The preparation and backbreaking work that goes into creating such an extravagant show is no mean feat. Indeed, Julien has one word for it: Pain. 'It's a painful, arduous task of embroidery and sewing,' he laughs. 'It is a total nightmare that looks like a total dream at the end. It's a lot of hard work. We were doing the hair and make-up test in my kitchen at half past four this morning. 'In the end I was like, ""guys, it's half past four, I'll see you at the venue tomorrow. If it's not working, we'll start all over again.""' Take a bow: Julien enjoys the applause at the end of his enjoyable (and incredibly glamorous) show .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . If you've recently bought an Amazon Fire TV box, you may have noticed the amount of data you’re using has jumped. This is due to a bug in the streaming box’s screensaver feature that means picture files aren’t being cached correctly. Screensaver images are taken directly from a user’s cloud storage, and the bug causes the full picture size to be used - rather than a compressed version - each time the screensaver refreshes. Amazon Fire TV users have complained that the streaming box is draining their internet data. Amazon said this is due to a bug in the streaming box's screensaver feature (pictured) that means . image files aren't being cached properly. It is working on fixing the problem and has advised users to disable the feature temporarily . Any photos and videos uploaded to Amazon Cloud Drive are automatically available on Amazon Fire TV. These images can be used to create a screensaver for the streaming box. The screensaver launches when Amazon Fire TV is left idle, and the default screensaver uses a slideshow of images. The 'mosaic' screensaver, instead, shows these images as an ever-changing grid. The data use flaw was only discovered in this mosaic layout. To disable this feature, press the Home button, select Settings, select System, and then select Screen Saver. And each time an image is taken, the box uses data to extract the file. Amazon told MailOnline it is aware of the . problem and is working on getting it fixed. It added that affected . users can disable the feature in the meantime. The issue was raised by California-based Tyler Hayes, who complained to Amazon about data use on his Fire TV after discovering the streaming box was using more than 60GB of data a day. Once he unplugged the device, data barely peaked above 20GB. Other users have similarly complained on forum threads including Hacker News. The amount of data the bug drains depends on how many photos are being used in the screensaver, so it can vary. People with unlimited data packages may not be charged extra for the additional use, but they're speed may be capped - depending on the deal they have with their service provider. Users who have a set data limit may find themselves exceeding their monthly caps and could be charged extra. Hayes initially blamed Amazon Fire TV’s Advanced Streaming and Prediction (ASAP) feature for draining his data. ASAP learns what movies and shows users like, and gets them ready to be watched. This is designed to remove buffering, but means data is used in the background to prepare these shows. This tool can’t be switched off. But, after alerting Amazon to the problem, the retailer discovered it was actually a fault in the ‘mosaic’ screensaver feature.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A gym teacher is retiring after a 40-year career - and taking his trademark yearbook outfit with him. Dale Irby, 63, accidentally wore the same clothes - a brown v-neck sweater and groovy white patterned shirt- for the school yearbook photo in both 1973 and 1974. When his wife Cathy, also a teacher, dared him to wear the outfit for the third-year running at  Prestonwood Elementary in Texas, Mr Irby accepted the challenge - and ran with it.

He told the Dallas Morning News: 'I was so embarrassed when I got the . school pictures back that second year and realized I had worn the very . same thing as the first year... After five pictures, it was like: ''Why . stop?''' He said that he wore the outfit because he had been instructed to smarten up instead of wearing his usual gym shorts for the school picture. With each passing year, the frames change, the mustache gets a little bushier and the hair begins to grey - but the outfit stays the same. Mr Irby added that it is the same shirt he's been using for every photograph which he can still get into - as long as he sucks his stomach in a little. The school principal said Mr Irby's legacy would be that he taught all his school children the value of good sportsmanship and to respect others. The school gym has been renamed in his honor.

"By . Stephanie Linning . The seaside house immortalised in the classic film The French Lieutenant's Woman has been sold to the former Lord Mayor of London, Sir Roger Gifford. Ware House, which is situated on 17 acres of sprawling land, boasts some of the most stunning views in Britain - looking out over 26 miles of coastline, with not a single property in sight. The six-bed Regency house in Lyme Regis, Dorset, featured in the 1981 movie as the home of Meryl Streep's troubled character. It was put on the market last year by . owner Minnie Churchill, the granddaughter-in-law of former Prime . Minister Winston Churchill. Secluded: Miss Churchill and her partner Simon Bird bought the 200-year-old home in 1999 but are moving to Berkshire to be near her children and grandchildren .

Sir Roger and Lady Gifford are believed to have paid almost £3millon for the stunning property. The Lord Mayor is elected annually as head of the City of London Corporation and former banker Sir Roger became the 685th person elected to the role between 2012 and 2013. It's different to the Mayor of London's role. Currently Boris Johnson, he leads the Greater London Authority (GLA) and is responsible for the strategic governance of Greater London.

'It has to be one of the best views in the country and it is a beautiful location.' The impressive property was featured as the main house in the French Lieutenant's Woman - a film based on a novel by John Fowles that was later adapted for the screen by playwright Harold Pinter.

One has marble floors and a chandelier in the bathroom, another has a glorious balcony overlooking its beautiful lawn and a third was featured in a popular cookery television show. But these amazing houses are not competing against each other - rather their occupants are - as these are the seven homes of six men and one woman running in the Republican presidential race. Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum own a wide range of houses which were analysed in a New York Times feature yesterday. Newt Gingrich: The home of the former House Speaker in McLean, Virginia. His bathroom has many mirrors . Jon Huntsman: The former Utah governor's townhouse in the Kalorama neighbourhood of Washington D.C. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has a 5,206 sq ft estate built only 24 years ago in McLean, Virginia, and it is notable for its master bathroom which has some impressive features. The bathroom features a marble floor with a dark granite and gold vanity fitting below brass brackets and a chandelier, while there are decorated windows and many mirrors dotted around. But House Beautiful editor Newell Turner told the New York Times: ‘His house sits so awkwardly on its site... The lots and the neighbourhood are too tight for such a fidgety house.’ Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman has a five-bedroom townhouse in Washington D.C., once used by contenders on series seven of Bravo TV show Top Chef, reported the New York Times. Mitt Romney: The ex-Massachusetts governor's home on Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire . Rick Perry: The entrance to the gated community where the Texas Governor has a home near Austin, Texas . Ron Paul: The former home of the Texas Representative, advertised online, is seen in Lake Jackson, Texas . His previous home appeared in Home and Design magazine nine years ago and it was redecorated  in a pattern of red, yellow, fuchsia and blue, while plenty of traditional furniture was placed inside too. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has . the most houses of all candidates - no surprise given he is by far the . richest too. His pictured home is on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. He has recently sold houses in Belmont, Massachusetts and Park City, Utah, but he also has a beautiful oceanfront home in California as well as the New Hampshire abode, reported the New York Times. The Romneys’ Belmont house was praised for its creme fabric and curved ceiling in the bathroom, while the Lake Winnipesaukee compound was labelled by its architects as ‘casually comfortable’. Texas Governor Rick Perry’s gated home in Austin, Texas, boasts five bedrooms, seven baths, three dining rooms and a 1,100 sq ft guest house, reported the New York Times. The home is worth around $2million and features a balcony overlooking a well-maintained lawn. Texas Representative Ron Paul put . his four-bedroom ranch house in Lake Jackson, Texas, on the market by . creating a website for buyers, which showed its pool surrounded by the . u-shaped home. Michele Bachmann: The Minnesota Representative's charming home in Stillwater, Minnesota, is pictured .

Presidential candidates: (Left-to-right) Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Jon Huntsman pose before a debate in Sioux City, Iowa, earlier this month .

'His house sits so awkwardly on its site... The lots and the neighbourhood are too tight for such a fidgety house' Newell Turner on Newt Gingrich's home . Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann bought a house in 2008 for $760,000 in West Lakeland Township, Minnesota, which was built a year earlier for a charity construction project. It was in fact originally listed at $1.75million so it appears she got quite a bargain for the home, which features a sunroom, breakfast room and large living room, reported the New York Times. Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum has the most traditional of all the houses and his  Great Falls, Virginia, abode is designed in a 1970s colonial style. It cost him $2million in 2007.","Gingrich has 5,206 sq ft estate in Virginia with mirrors around the bathroom .

"By . Vanessa Allen . Britain has become the super-rich capital of the world – with more than 100 billionaires living in the UK for the first time. A total of 104 billionaires now call Britain home, with a combined wealth of £301billion between them, it was revealed yesterday. It means the UK has more billionaires per head than any other country. Moving here: French businessman Francois Henri Pinault with his wife Salma Hayek . Super-rich: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, pictured here with his girlfriend Daria Zhukova, has a fortune of £8.52 billion, down £780 million from last year . Top of the rich list: Srichand Hinduja and Gopichand Hinduja have been named the richest pair in Britain by the Sunday Times Rich List . And the vast majority have their homes in London, meaning the capital boasts the greatest number of billionaires of any city in the world, beating New York and Moscow to the top spot. London has become such a hub for the super-rich that it now accounts for 72 billionaires – almost 10 per cent of all the billionaires in the world. Moscow has the second highest billionaire population with 48, followed by New York with 43, then San Francisco, Los Angeles and Hong Kong. But only a third of Britain’s billionaires were actually born British, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Indian-born brothers Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja top the UK rich list, with a combined wealth of £11.9billion from their global conglomerate. They are followed by international tycoons and oligarchs who made their fortunes in aluminium, oil and coal, including Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov and Queens Park Rangers stakeholder and steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal also feature. The only British-born billionaire in the top ten is the Duke of Westminster, who owns swathes of central London and takes tenth place in the list with his £8.5billion fortune. Britain’s reputation as a financial capital and its relatively low tax regime have been credited for attracting ‘non-dom’ residents, keen to invest in property in London and the South East. The country now has one billionaire for every 607,692 residents, compared to one for every 1,022,475 in the US, which has the second highest number of billionaires per capita. Unlike America, Britain does not tax its non-domicile residents on their global wealth, meaning they pay tax only on their UK income. Francois-Henri Pinault, head of the Gucci fashion empire, is moving to London from France with his actress wife Salma Hayek after the French government introduced a 75 per cent tax rate for the most wealthy, though the couple say this is not the reason for their move. The number of billionaires in Britain has more than tripled in a decade and their total wealth has now overtaken pre-recession levels of 2008, when the UK’s 75 billionaires were worth £201billion. Among new British-born members of the billionaire club is West End producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who saw his fortune rise to £1billion in the past year. Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and his wife arrive for the re-opening ceremony of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow . Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley came in 23rd on the list . Here is the Sunday Times 2014 Billionaire List: . Rank, name, wealth, increase/decrease in wealth . 1.

The country's leaders took time out of their busy schedule to send a thoughtful congratulatory letter to the Queen on her official birthday. The wishes were sent by the country's second most powerful man Kim Yong-nam, the president of the Presidium of the Supreme Assembly of North Korea, on June 14. The second-in-command to Kim Jong-Un, pictured right, sent a congratulatory letter to the Queen, pictured right, to mark her official birthday on June 14 . The official Korean Central News Agency reported that the message 'wished the queen good health and happiness'. The letter also reportedly wished 'well-being and prosperity' to the British people. According to the KCNA, the British embassy in Pyongyang even marked the occasion with a reception which was attended by the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade. According to experts, the move shows North Korea is looking for 'new friends', particularly as China moves closer to forging an alliance with South Korea. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told The Telegraph: 'North Korea is looking for new friends, . while they have also sent officials to London to make money on the . stock market and seek development aid. 'But there is also real concern in the leadership there that the regime could collapse without China's support, so they are looking for a country that might provide them with political asylum. It is possible that they think Britain might provide that.' North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was yesterday pictured on board a submarine . as he inspected a navy unit stationed on the east coast of the country . China, North Korea's most significant ally, has attempted to bring Kim Jong-un's regime to heel, over growing anger at the country's refusal to stop the development of nuclear warheads. In January, Beijing stopped sending important oil over the border. On June 5, KCNA reported that Kim Jong-un sent a message to Bashar Al-Assad, congratulating the Syrian president on his re-election. The self-promoting photos of the dictator were released by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party . Meanwhile, Kim Jong-Un was spotted out and about on a submarine in his latest show of self-promotion. The images, released by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, show the North Korean leader leading a drill on the vessel, while also teaching the captain of the North Korean Navy Unit 167 how to navigate. The posed-up shots also show the leader riding on top of the submarine as it remained above water and being shown around inside.","Kim Yong-nam, the country's second most powerful man, sent the wishes .

Hundreds of Albanian police, backed by armoured vehicles, stormed a lawless southern village after suspected marijuana growers allegedly fired rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and machine guns at officers during a drug raid. Four people - a policeman and three villagers - have been hurt so far, suffering light gunshot injuries in the hostilities in and around Lazarat, a major marijuana-producing centre 230 kilometres (140 miles) south of the capital, Tirana, on Monday and Tuesday. Gangs based in Lazarat are believed to produce about 900 metric tons of cannabis a year, worth about 4.5 billion euros (£3.5 billion/ $6.1 billion) - roughly half of the small Balkan country's GDP.

"By . Nick Enoch . Richard Walton, 32, kept Milo the marmoset in a faeces-covered birdcage where he had little daylight and no toys to play with . A man is facing jail for causing unnecessary suffering to a marmoset - after he was caught taking it to the pub. Richard Walton, 32, kept three-year-old Milo in a faeces-covered birdcage where he had little daylight and no toys to play with. Walton, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, had already been banned from owning animals for two years for neglecting a dog which had claws so overgrown it couldn’t walk. When he started taking Milo to his local pub on a lead, concerned drinkers informed the RSPCA. The common marmoset was so badly malnourished and deprived of sunlight that he weighed the same as an orange when he was rescued, and was developing the bone condition rickets. Instead of feeding him a varied diet of fresh and dried fruit, vegetables, seeds and vitamin-enriched baby food, Walton gave Milo only cherries and grapes. Walton pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court and will be sentenced in January. In their natural home in the Brazilian rainforest, marmosets are highly social creatures who mate for life and live in tight-knit family communities. Dr Alison Cronin, director of Monkey World animal sanctuary, helps to rescue Milo (being carried in the container, above). The RSPCA was alerted after receiving a tip-off that Walton had taken Milo to the pub on at least two occasions . The common marmoset was so badly malnourished and deprived of sunlight that he weighed the same as an orange when he was rescued. Above, the cage in which he was kept . But Milo lived in isolation in his cage apart from when he was taken to the Portsmouth Arms in Basingstoke, where Walton would pose with his pet on his shoulder. The RSPCA was alerted after receiving a tip-off that heavily tattooed Walton had taken him to the pub on at least two occasions. After he was rescued, Milo was taken to Monkey World animal sanctuary in Wareham, Dorset, where he has now returned to full health. Director of the sanctuary, Dr Alison Cronin, said: 'In the wild, they come from Brazil and live in extended family groups. Milo lived in isolation in his cage apart from when he was taken to the Portsmouth Arms in Basingstoke, where Walton would pose with his pet on his shoulder . After he was rescued, Milo was taken to Monkey World animal sanctuary in Wareham, Dorset, suffering from rickets but has now recovered . When Milo was rescued in June, he weighed just 280g but is now up to a healthy 350g. Dr Cronin said: 'Milo was also starved of the companionship and interaction that marmosets crave' Marmosets, the . world's smallest monkeys, are named after the French word 'marmouset', . meaning dwarf - because they measure just six inches tall. Their mixed-colour coats gives them camouflage in the trees of the Amazon rainforest in South America. Like monkeys, marmosets are tree-dwelling primates that move in a quick, jerky manner. They live in tight-knit families and always need a social group. 'They are a species of marmoset that mate for life, and almost always have twins, and the male is very important to the family group, because they help care for the infants. 'Milo was starved of the companionship and interaction that marmosets crave. 'They live in very tight family groups and should always live in a social group, no matter what the circumstances. 'Thankfully, he was rescued just in time. He is one of the lucky ones because we got hold of him and saved him while he was relatively young. 'His rehabilitation wasn’t too difficult and he hopefully has a long and happy life ahead of him.' When Milo was rescued in June, he weighed just 280g but is now up to a healthy 350g. He has also found love while at the sanctuary with another rescued marmoset called Clydie. Dr Cronin criticised the animal traders . who are selling the monkeys for upwards of £1,200 with little or no . proper care instructions. Milo (pictured) is now living happily at Monkey World - and has also found love there, with another rescued marmoset called Clydie . She said: 'Over the past 18 months, we have collected 25 monkeys from the British pet trade. '[They carry out] unscrupulous pet deals pushing exotic pets onto the British public who don’t know what these exotic animals need. 'Marmosets are common victims because mothers almost always give birth to twins, who are taken away as babies before the mother’s hormones can change back so she falls pregnant as soon as possible afterwards.' Sentencing of Walton was adjourned until January 16 pending a psychiatric report. The maximum sentence for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is six months in jail.","Richard Walton, from Basingstoke, Hants, kept Milo the marmoset in cage which saw little daylight .

"By . James  Nye . A graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who went missing more than a week ago in northern India has been found dead in a ravine after she reportedly slipped while jogging and fell several hundred feet off a cliff, MIT officials said Sunday. Kaitlin Goldstein, 28, a native of Providence, Rhode Island, was found dead Saturday in a remote region of northern India known as Ladakh, in a ravine below a trail where she went running on June 14. She hadn't been seen since. Her parents, who went to India to look for their daughter, told MIT officials that she apparently slipped on some loose rock before falling off the cliff. Kaitlin Goldstein, 28, a native of Providence, Rhode Island, was found . dead Saturday in a remote region of northern India known as Ladakh . Goldstein, a competitive runner, was working on a doctorate in architecture at MIT in Cambridge. She arrived in India on June 7 to take part in a workshop on energy and development on the campus of the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh near the city of Leh. The workshop was organized by the MIT-affiliated Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values and the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi. She had been scheduled to stay after the workshop and help install solar panels at a nearby Buddhist monastery, MIT officials said. Education: Goldstein was studying at the campus of the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh near the city of Leh . MIT President L. Rafael Reif sent an email to the members of the MIT community on Sunday notifying them that Goldstein had died and that counseling services were available on campus. 'She was passionately interested in energy solutions for the developing world, a subject she was exploring in a remote region of northern India at the time of her death,' Reif wrote. 'The death of someone so young and promising is a terrible loss; we should all take time to reach out to those around us.' Goldstein was last seen on June 14 heading out for an early morning run up a mountain trail. When she didn't return, students and instructors at the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh went looking for her. Tragedy: The promising student has been missing for more than a week and her parents flew to India to search for her . The search grew to include local police, the Intelligence Bureau of India, the American embassy in New Dehli, the U.S. State Department and the FBI. MIT also hired a private security firm based in Mumbai, MIT officials said. Goldstein's parents, Drs. Jack Goldstein and Jean Plover, went to India to search for their daughter. Before her body was found, Goldstein's brother, Adam Goldstein, told WPRI-TV in Providence that he was worried she may have been kidnapped, and was concerned because of highly publicized gang rapes in India. Adam Goldstein said his sister was 'really passionate about helping poorer places out.'","Rhode Island native Katilin Goldstein, 28, discovered dead in Leh, in northern India .

"By . Tamara Cohen . The BBC licence fee is outdated and could be abolished in as little as two years, BBC managers have been told. John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which is looking at new ways to fund the broadcaster, has told executives it will ‘not survive’. It could be axed at the next renewal of the BBC Charter in 2016, or if no alternative is agreed on, it may be kept for part of the next Charter period – which ends in 2026 – but no longer, he said. Prediction: Tory MP John Whittingdale, left, told BBC bosses including head of news James Harding, right, that the days of the licence fee are numbered . The Tory MP has long been critical of the licence fee, but at a private meeting in parliament he made clear it imminently faces the chop. The licence fee has been set at £145.50 since 2010. Mr Whittingdale told BBC bosses including James Harding, the director of news and current affairs, and Peter Horrocks, the head of the World Service: ‘I don’t think the licence fee will survive. ‘There are lots of people already debating the terms of funding models. That’s exactly what my committee is doing’. After the meeting, Mr Whittingdale told the Mail that the licence fee was no longer a feasible model as so many people watch programmes online via iPlayer and do not have to pay. The decision on when to replace it will be made by the Government after his cross-party committee present their recommendations in a report due out this Autumn. Suggestions include introducing a banded ‘TV tax’, or a subscription system. However, Mr Whittingdale said the case for public funding ‘remains very strong’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Support for the licence fee has risen by 22 per cent since 2004 and it remains the most popular way of funding the BBC.’ Yet a poll last year found that 49 per cent of the public want the licence fee abolished.","Tory MP John Whittingdale told executives the fee will 'not survive'

"By . Louise Cheer . Extraordinary footage has emerged of a 'Spiderman' group of thrill seekers who jump on moving trains and scale the roof tops of high rise buildings. The trio call themselves Public Enemy and in an 11-minute video they show off ways to experience unrivalled views of Melbourne by scaling buildings and trains. In the footage, they are seen using hidden or restricted staircases to gain access to the rooftops of the city's high rises - including the Melbourne GPO, Rydges Hotel, Crowne Plaza and The Langham - as well as one of Australia's largest construction sites, the 72-storey Prima Pearl. Scroll down for video . The group called Public Enemy have released an 11-minute video on YouTube of their adventures . In the footage, they provide unique views of Melbourne's CBD - including some of its iconic buildings . From the rooftops of these buildings, they get a bird's eye view of some of the city's best known landmarks - including Flinders Street Station, Southbank and St Paul's Cathedral. But what has alarmed Victoria Police the most are the group's train-surfing antics, where they are seen jumping off station platforms and latching themselves onto the outside of moving trains as well as breaking into the train driver's compartment. The footage - which has so far garnered more than 8,000 views - emerged just days after the body of a naked 25-year-old man was retrieved by police in a stunt gone wrong. It is thought the man was electrocuted by power lines after he climbed to the roof of a moving train while it was pulling into Balaclava station, near St Kilda, in Melbourne's south-east. In the footage, you can see them scale buildings as well as trains in Melbourne . Victoria Police said they are now investigating the alarming footage . The group have also filmed themselves breaking into the train driver's compartment . Victoria Police Inspector Darren Cooper said the kind of videos released by Public Enemy was 'glamourising' risky - and sometimes life-threatening - behaviour. 'I consider this [behaviour] as very, very risk, quite silly in many ways,' he said. 'I think it's becoming more and more public. Online creates an audience [where] you've got access to tens of thousands of people instantaneously. 'Sometimes it's the motivation for these individuals...to increase their profile.' Police say most of this behaviour was graffiti-related . They have warned people against putting themselves in such risky situations . Police say the online culture gives them access to a wider audience which is a possible motivator for this behaviour . Insp Cooper also shed some light on how they were gaining access to areas that are not open to the public. 'Some of these people are quite sophisticated, they operate in crews,' he said. 'They have got a different range of techniques - [including] access keys. We've seen in the past they tended to be Metro [train operator] workers.' Insp Cooper confirmed police would be investigating the video to catch offenders. He said a lot of the behaviour seen in the video was graffiti related and there were teams dedicated to investigating these crimes. The release of the footage comes just days after a 25-year-old died in a stunt gone wrong where he climbed on top of a Melbourne train . Police say groups like Public Enemy use many different techniques to gain access to restricted areas - in the past, some have found to be Metro train staff .

"By . Mike Merritt . A castle that was Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother’s beloved Highland hideaway is being rented out to paying guests — at the price of £50,000 for a long weekend. It is the first time that a royal residence has ever been let out. The Castle of Mey was the only residence directly owned by Queen Elizabeth. Queen Elizabeth in 1986 with her beloved corgis in the grounds of the Castle of Mey, the only residence she  personally owned. Her late Majesty ceased to be the Queen Mother on her death . Over the decades, she filled her holiday home with distinctive knick-knacks and personal flourishes. Now, 12 years after her death, the castle in the north of Scotland is being let out to carefully-vetted guests. The Mail on Sunday understands that for £50,000 up to a dozen people can spend a long weekend in the imposing 16th Century building where Prince Charles is still a regular visitor. The Queen’s own party planner provides a full programme of events for guests to enjoy, including stalking and salmon fishing. The one room guests cannot stay in - Her late Majesty's bedroom in the Castle of Mey, the most northerly castle in Britain . This was HRH Princess Margaret's room when she stayed at the Castle of Mey . The desk of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth with her writing paper, envelopes, reading glasses, letter opener and photographs of her husband, the late king . The Castle of Mey was first seen by Queen Elizabeth in 1952 when she was mourning the death of her husband HM King George VI. It was the only residence she privately owned . Guests can eat at the same dining table used by Queen Elizabeth, and sit in her favourite chair. On the dining room walls are landscapes painted by Prince Philip. The drawing room has a carpet that was given to Queen Elizabeth in 1990 by her daughter the Queen as a 90th birthday present. The grounds of the Castle of Mey which is about six miles west of John o' Groats . The kitchen in the Castle of Mey which having catered for royal guests for sixty years will now be preparing meals for those who can afford £50,000 for a weekend . Castle managing director Shirley Farquhar said: ‘As soon as you walk  in, you can feel the Queen Mother’s presence, as it was her home.’ The one part of the castle that is off limits is the late queen’s bedroom. The weekends have been introduced as a fund-raising venture by the Queen Elizabeth Castle of Mey Trust – of which Prince Charles is President – which owns the castle and runs it in memory of his grandmother. The ‘Mey Occasions’ (as the weekends are dubbed by the trust) are not advertised. Instead, invitations are extended to a small circle of wealthy business-people and philanthropists. The trust plans just ‘two or three’ weekends a year. A trial weekend was run last October in which selected guests stayed for free. Last month, the first paying guests were the family and friends of a foreign businessman, who re-booked for next year. The next guests – in October – are American. Numbers are limited to no more than 12 guests, served by a staff of 20, some flown up from London. The breaks are designed by Royal party planner Lady Elizabeth Anson, an honorary patron of the trust. Amid the royal grandeur of the Castle of Mey, a curious selection of tacky knick-knacks are testament to the late Queen’s sense of fun and mischief. Her delight in such novelties was well-known and her Private Secretary, Sir Martin Gilliat, would encourage guests, especially the young royals, to bring back unusual souvenirs for their hostess. In the drawing room above a 16th Century Flemish tapestry, is a small Loch Ness monster cuddly toy in a tartan dress , while on the mantelpiece lies a porcelain figure of a drunken Scotswoman clinging to a lamppost. Elsewhere, there’s a ceramic bagpiper (above right), a wooden axe-wielding clansman  and toy versions of a sheep (right), a Highland cow and a haggis. Lady Elizabeth organised a dinner for 40 members of the Royal family  on the eve of the Duke and Duchess  of Cambridge’s wedding. Sir Mick Jagger, President and Mrs Clinton and the late Baroness Thatcher have also asked her to organise parties. Inside, the castle has had a £250,000 makeover, overseen by former Olympic skier Baron Piers Von Westenholz, a close friend of Prince Charles. Ashe Windham, who served as the Queen Elizabeth’s equerry at the castle – and is now chairman of Mey Trust – said the venture would help the castle meet its running costs and was a fitting honour to the late queen. He added: ‘A complete makeover was finished in April. This was long overdue, as the place was beginning  to take on a careworn air.’ Queen Elizabeth first saw what was then Barrogill Castle in 1952, while mourning her husband, King George VI. Falling for its isolated charm, she bought the most northerly  castle on the British mainland, restored it and created beautiful walled gardens. Queen Elizabeth, who died in March 2002, aged 101, enjoyed a low-key lifestyle there. Even the ancient refrigerator she refused to part with still works perfectly 60 years on.","Her late Majesty bought the 16th Century castle in 1952, while mourning her husband King George VI .

Ed Miliband was confronted by an angry campaigner yesterday who said his elderly mother had died after suffering neglect under the Labour-run NHS in Wales.

"By . Sebastian Shakespeare . Ready to score: Judith Weir is in the running to be the new Master Of The Queen's Music . For almost 400 years, it is a role that has been filled by celebrated male composers, including Sir Edward Elgar and most recently Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, but now the Queen could have made a radical new departure. I hear that the new Master Of The Queen’s Music has been chosen — and it is likely to be a woman. ‘The name will be announced next month,’ says my man at the Palace. ‘The word is that it will be the first Mistress Of The Queen’s Music.’ One of the most likely candidates to succeed Sir Peter is Judith Weir, who was awarded the Queen’s Medal for Music in 2007. The 60-year-old Cambridge graduate trained with the late Sir John Tavener, whose Song For Athene was performed at Princess Diana’s funeral, and is best known for her operas, such as The Vanishing Bridegroom. It would not be the first time that the Queen has broken tradition by appointing a woman to an artistic role. In 2009, Carol Ann Duffy became the first female Poet Laureate. However, the Gorbals-born versifier has done little to endear herself to the monarch. The role involves writing poems for important royal occasions, but Duffy, whose predecessors include Ted Hughes and Sir John Betjeman, has yet to compose an ode to mark the birth of Prince George. Another possible candidate for Mistress Of The Queen’s Music is Sally Beamish, 57, whose work spans film and TV to pieces for the BBC Proms. Establishment rivals for the post include Michael Berkeley, a godson of Benjamin Britten, who was elevated to the Lords as a crossbencher last year, and John Rutter, the composer of an anthem for Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding in 2011. Traditionally, the Master Of The Queen’s Music, who is expected to compose tunes to commemorate important royal events, holds the post for life. However, Sir Peter, who has been treated for leukaemia, accepted it for just ten years. The 79-year-old composer, completed that term in March, but agreed to continue until a successor was found. A Palace spokesman says an announcement about the post, for which the holder is paid an honorary stipend, will be made in ‘due course’. Rushing, arms outstretched, Prince Harry’s ex, Cressida Bonas, gave her old Stowe headmaster Anthony Wallersteiner a big hug at a gala in aid of Children In Crisis. Dr Wallersteiner, who was on the gala committee, tells me: ‘She called me “Headmaster” and said she was pursuing her career as an actress, having been inspired by our head of drama, Nick Bayley. ‘When Cressida came to Stowe last summer, she was desperate to find Nick to thank him in person. We spent about 20 minutes after the concert looking for him.’ Having won over the British Royal Family — the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge revealed they are ‘huge fans’ of the show — Downton Abbey has set its sights on royals abroad. Yesterday, Downton stars Joanne Froggatt, Sophie McShera and Lesley Nicol posed with Prince Albert of Monaco (right) at the 54th Monte Carlo Television Festival.

The Pelty gets its name from something known as the ‘Peltier effect’, the physical process that powers the speaker. Scroll down for video . If you’re looking for your next must-have ‘glamping’ accessory – then this Pelty bluetooth speaker could be it. Not only does it provide ambient lighting, but it can also play your favourite tunes using nothing but the power of a candle . The Pelty gets its name from something known as the ‘Peltier effect’, the physical process that powers the speaker. The phenomenon describes the temperature difference created by applying a voltage between two electrodes connected to a semiconductor material. On the Pelty, the effect provides power using a thermoelectric effect, where a voltage is produced using a device with contrasting temperatures. This is a thermoelectric effect where a voltage is produced using a device with contrasting temperatures. No batteries or charging cables are required. Noise from the speaker will last as long as the candle, and a user can switch it off by blowing out the flame. Milan-based inventor, Gianluca Gamba, came up with the idea for the device as he was organising a dinner on his terrace for his fiancée. The Pelty gets its name from something known as the ‘Peltier effect’, the physical process that powers the speaker. Milan-based inventor, Gianluca Gamba, came up with the idea for the device as he was organising a dinner on his terrace for his fiancée . He needed some music to create the right mood, but he realised his traditional bluetooth speaker wasn't appropriate for the occasion. What he came up with, instead, was a design that was made from ceramic, wood, and glass. According to Gamba, the system can connect to a musical player within a few seconds of the candle being lit. The designers claim a typical candle can last up to five hours and the loudness of the system is comparable to any other docking station. The Pelty is currently trying to attract funds via Indiegogo and is aiming for a $100,000 (£58,900) goal. The regular pledge price for a Pelty is $269 (£158) but an early pledge of at least $199 (£117) will secure you a model.

"By . Associated Press . Updated: . 15:15 EST, 12 January 2012 . Prosecutors say Kenneth Shong founded a fake university while in prison. If convicted, Shong ¿ whose criminal past dates back two decades and includes fleeing the U.S. ¿ could face up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine . A con man is accused of starting a fake university and churning out fake diplomas – while in prison. Kenneth Shong, 45, who is currently serving time in a Wisconsin prison appeared in court on Tuesday to face a fraud charge, years after the complex scheme was uncovered. He is alleged to have worked with associates outside the prison walls to operate a suspected diploma mill that was recruiting students for at least two years before investigators caught on. Shong, described by a judge in 2005 as having a history of 'outwitting, outplaying and outlasting authorities,' was set to be released from prison last Saturday on a forgery conviction. He was instead taken into custody and charged Thursday with fraudulent writings in Winnebago County. A hearing to determine whether he will stand trial is scheduled for Jan. 19. His public defender, Katena Roberts-Turner, did not immediately return a call for comment Tuesday. If convicted, Shong – whose criminal past dates back two decades and includes fleeing the US – could face up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. According to the criminal complaint, Shong was at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in 2006 when he encouraged another inmate, Kenneth Fleming, who wanted to become a paralegal, to enroll in 'Carlingford University.' Shong allegedly said the school was accredited, incorporated in Delaware and Alabama and degrees were granted through their London campus. Fleming later arranged for his mother to send a $1,740 tuition payment to a post office box in Mobile, Alabama. Back in the clink: Shong was already in prison for fraud and tax evasion charges. He faces up to six more years behind bars . The complaint said the inmate became suspicious of 'poor business practices and unresponsiveness' in relation to the school returning his grades and giving further lessons. The inmate later learned the university was not incorporated in Delaware and Alabama and complained to the state in 2008. Two other inmates from the Oshkosh prison also complained about the 'university' and Shong, who has several aliases, including Kenneth Onapolis, investigators said. The complaint also noted that Carlingford University's website had statements that were misleading and erroneous. Shong also had convicted sex offender David Kaster, whom he met in prison, help him start a post office box in Green Bay after Kaster was released that Shong used to claim he had a Green Bay ""Regional Training Center,"" according to the complaint. Shong transferred to the Racine Correctional Institution in the fall 2007, and officials there began getting suspicious of his activities and started to investigate. The Wisconsin Educational Approval Board determined that Carlingford University was operating in Wisconsin without necessary approval, and issued a cease-and-desist order. The Department of Justice's investigation is ongoing. Charges took so long because the case was complex and was recently reassigned to a new prosecutor, said Justice Department spokeswoman Dana Brueck. Shong's criminal past includes convictions for bank fraud, theft and other financial crimes. After years on the run, he was captured in 2002 by US marshals in Vanuatu, a small island near Australia, and returned to the US to face federal fraud and tax evasion charges. When that prison term ended, Wisconsin authorities brought him back to finish serving a 12-year sentence on a 1989 sentence on forgery charges. He had escaped while on parole in 1993. At a court hearing in 1989, Dane County prosecutor Ann Sayles said Shong used fake checks, obtained bank credit to buy an expensive car, and defrauded companies to buy plane tickets under a fake name. She called him 'a professional con man' and said his shady business activities were continuing in jail. 'I'm not so certain the public is safe even with him in prison,' she said.","'Encouraged fellow inmate to enroll in ""Carlingford University"" '

"By . Martha De Lacey . We're taught to stay away from the bedrooms of our exes at all costs, and frequently reminded that nothing that goes on in there post-breakup can ever be a good thing for our mental well-being. But received wisdom of this ilk is being shattered by new findings suggesting that 'ex-sex' can, in some cases, be a good idea. Divorced partners who have slipped up and fallen back into the marital bed report that sex with an ex can actually lessen the psychological distress caused by the break-up. Sex with a former lover can ease the pain of the split, says new research conducted at the University of Arizona and published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology . In a recent study published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, researchers at the University of Arizona examined a group of 137 recently divorced adults and asked how many had had the occasional post-conjugal visit after their divorce papers had been signed. Findings found that most participants (82.5 per cent) remained in contact with their ex after the separation, and almost one-fifth (21.9 per cent) had sex. Whether or not the ex-sex actually helped a partner get over the end of their marriage depended on how 'over' it they already were. Partners who hadn't accepted the break-up found the intimate encounters actually helped lessen the pain of divorce. We're always taught that sex with an ex is an emotional minefield, but new research suggests it could actually help partners having difficulty coming to terms with a break-up . Meanwhile, partners who had accepted the break-up found sex made no difference at all to how they dealt with it, indicating that 'ex-sex' may not be quite as emotionally detrimental as we had previously thought, and that it can, in fact, have benefits for those who are not-quite over their relationship. Psychologists believe that break-ups can leave us with attachment needs that go unfulfilled, and that sex with an ex helps to provide some sense of security, and at least partial fulfillment of those needs. Sex toy firm Lovehoney found that more women than men look back with longing on past relationships and admit to having had better sex with an ex than with their current partner. The survey  of 1,100 adults found that 38 per cent of women said the best sex of their lives was in a previous relationship. Sex and relationship expert Tracey Cox said this 'grass is greener' syndrome is not new. Cox said many women benefited from having sex with their ex because it ultimately gave them 'closure' on the relationship. Tracey Cox, sex expert, said: 'I still think it's dodgy ground if there's a lot of emotion involved - iif a much-loved partner who has left is interested in sex with you it sends of message of hope - and that could be false hope' She said: 'Sometimes we need to go back to move forward, and revisiting the sexual side of the relationship can sometimes make us see very clearly that we've idealised the relationship or feel much less pain than we thought. So there's a sense of closure that can be helpful.' Cox, who has her own range of sex toys with Lovehoney, warned women to wary before jumping into bed with their ex. She said: 'But I still think it's dodgy ground if there's a lot of emotion involved. If a much-loved partner who has left is interested in sex with you it sends of message of hope - and that could be false hope. 'On their side it's a trip down sexual memory lane, on your side, it's make-up sex with a view of rekindling. 'If you're going to do it, make sure you go into it with a clear understanding of what it means to the other person.' In the hit movie It's Complicated, Meryl Street and Alec Baldwin star as exes who start sleeping together years after they divorce.","Study at University of Arizona found someone not over divorce will benefit .

"By . Catherine Eade . The digital revolution is coming... to a hotel near you. Well in the States anyway, where virtual currency Bitcoin is now being accepted as a form of payment for hotel bookings through travel website Expedia. For Expedia customers in the US making a hotel booking, bitcoins are now offered as a payment method alongside Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Paypal. Expedia's global vice-president, Michael Gulmann, said the company was in a good position 'to solve travel planning and booking for our customers and partners alike by adopting the latest payment technologies.' Travellers making hotel bookings through Expedia in the US will now be able to use digital currency bitcoin alongside the usual payment methods . The company is only accepting the currency for hotel bookings to begin with, and is currently restricting the trial to its US site. But travel experts predict the company will expand the payment option for other services depending on the success with hotels. While Expedia is one of many to begin accepting the crypto-currency, it is the largest travel company to accept it so far. Other lodging companies that accept Bitcoin include MGM Resorts International and HomeAway, a vacation rental booking site. by No major airline carriers have approved the currency for payments. But banks across the world have raised concerns about the virtual currency over recent months, and it has been plagued by technological problems and security issues. Bitcoin: Coming to a hotel near you? It has also been the subject of much controversy since its launch, with fears that it can be manipulated by money launderers and black marketeers, and used to 'hide' wealth. Expedia will use Bitcoin exchange Coinbase for processing transactions, but Gulmann says the company will not store the currency, but convert Bitcoin deposits back into US dollars every 24 hours. Expedia is the first company in the travel sector to embrace the virtual currency, although an increasing number of companies are beginning to adopt Bitcoin: Google's Android platform already accepts the digital money, and Apple is looking into using it for downloads or in-app purchases from the Apple App Store. Virtual currencies are built around shared software, with users carrying out transactions directly, without having to go through a bank or other company. Coins are transferred directly from person to person and are kept in a digital wallet that can be accessed on a computer or mobile device. Creating . new coins is done through a process called 'mining' where users are . rewarded with new coins by taking part in mathematical . operations within the system using cryptography. As a result, Bitcoin is . more accurately known as a cryptocurrency. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. What is a bitcoin?Bitcoins . are just lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time . they travel from one owner to the next. They are the basic unit of a new . online economy which runs independently of any company, bank, or . government. Because Bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third . party getting involved, they have become popular with libertarians as . well as technophiles, speculators and criminals.Who's behind the currency?It's . a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people . operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and then adopted by a small . clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as Bitcoin began to . attract widespread attention, but proponents say that doesn't matter; . the currency obeys its own, internal logic.What's a bitcoin worth?Like . any other currency, Bitcoins are only worth as much as you and your . counterpart want them to be. In its early days, boosters swapped . Bitcoins back and forth for minor favors or just as a game. One website . even gave them away for free. As the market matured, the value of each . Bitcoin grew. At its height three months ago, a single Bitcoin was . valued at $1,200. On Tuesday, it was around $500.Is the currency widely used?There are currently around 11 million bitcoins in existence. Businesses ranging from blogging platform Wordpress to . retailer Overstock have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of . media coverage, but it's not clear whether the currency has really . taken off. On the one hand, leading Bitcoin payment processor BitPay . works with more than 20,000 businesses - roughly five times more than it . did last year. On the other, the total number of Bitcoin transactions . has stayed roughly constant at between 60,000 and 70,000 per day over . the same period, according to Bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info.","Bitcoin is entirely virtual currency that works without need for central bank .

Matthew Hudson-Smith is just 19 and had only run five 400 metre races this season before he took an astonishing 0.83 seconds off his personal best to become the quickest British athlete of 2014 over a lap of the track. The teenager’s 44.97sec performance to finish third at the Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix was also the second fastest time by a European athlete this season. It was a quite extraordinary breakthrough for a runner who only moved up to the 400m this season and he was rendered wide-eyed and almost speechless by his achievement. Hudson-Smith was only invited to take part in the prestigious Diamond League event five days before the race and ran blind from lane eight, yet finished with such a powerful surge on Saturday that there is surely more to come from this teenager. Bright future: Matthew Hudson-Smith reacts after finishing third in the 400m at the Glasgow Grand Prix . On the run: Hudson-Smith (far left) finishes strongly at the Diamond League meeting at Hampden Park . 1. Hudson-Smith is currently on a gap year, but plans to go to Worcester next year to study sports science. 2. His personal best of 44.97sec was the second quickest ever by a British teenager and ranks fifth of all time at Under 23 level. 3. The Birchfield Harrier dedicated Saturday’ssuccess to his coach, Tony Hadley, and his mum, and celebrated with a roast dinner at his nan’s. 4. Hudson-Smith won bronze medals in the 200m and 4x400m at the European JuniorChampionships last year, despite having run only one relay leg for his club before joining the British quartet. 5. He said he felt like ‘a jaguar being chased by a lion’ as he went under 45 seconds for the first time. ‘I surprised myself more than anything,’ he said. ‘I knew I would get to 300m fine but I seemed  to find a different gear so I just kept going. ‘It’s my first Diamond League event and I’ve set the bar pretty high. I’ve literally just moved  up from 200m. It was my sixth 400m of the year and it’s unbelievable.’ His coach, Tony Hadley, was not surprised. Hadley guided 1994 European 400m champion Du’aine Ladejo and world 4x400m champion Derek Redmond and knows a decent  one-lap runner when he sees one. It was Hadley who looked after Jim Redmond’s camera when he fought his way on to the track to help injured son Derek complete  his 400m semi-final at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Hudson-Smith won a European junior bronze medal over 200m last year, but turned heads in the 4x400m relay by running a 45.9sec split. He has since been selected to represent England in the relay at the Commonwealth Games, but now hopes to secure a place in the individual 400m at the European Championships when the selectors meet today. He might be the quickest British man this season but he was disqualified in the heats of the British Championships after stepping out of his lane and will therefore be reliant on the selectors’ discretion. ‘He was very angry about what happened at the trials,’ said Hadley. ‘It was like he got all dressed up for the party and then someone said, “You can’t come in”. Aiming high: Hudson-Smith is hoping to be selected for the European Championships after his recent displays . ‘We knew he had a quick time in him because I hadn’t seen the times he was running in training since Ladejo and Redmond. ‘He didn’t really distribute his speed very well on Saturday and he left some energy in the tank that could have been used on the back straight. ‘So he can go very, very fast if he keeps on working hard.’","Hudson-Smith ran 44.97sec at the Glasgow Grand Prix .

And cruise holidays are the most hassle-free form of break, according to a study. Climbing aboard a cruise ship pipped both city breaks and beach holidays to the post, when it came to the most popular type of holiday, with Britons saying they had the friendliest staff, there are fewer delays and the facilities are much cleaner than on other holidays. Stress-free: Almost a third of Britons polled said they were planning a cruise for their next holiday . The study asked participants the type of holiday they had been on in the past three years that they found to be the most reliable in terms of all-round planning and enjoyment, involving the least hassle. Cruise holidays were seen as having the cleanest facilities, less delays, friendlier and more engaging staff, better entertainment and no cancellations. And of those polled, almost a third, (31 per cent) stated that they had either already booked a cruise, or were planning one for their next holiday, in order to cut out the unnecessary stress and planning of alternative trips. When asked what they perceived to be the most reliable types of holiday, 52 per cent of participants said cruise holidays, 23 per cent said city breaks, 11 per cent said beach holidays and 8 per cent said skiing holidays. The research polled a total of 1,438 adults aged 18 and over, who had all been on both a cruise holiday as well as other types of holidays within the past three years.

England were given a boost on Saturday when it was confirmed that Phil Jones should be fit to play in the World Cup and that his Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney will be in peak condition for Brazil. Manager Roy Hodgson names his squad on Monday and it was feared Jones would be unavailable after injuring his left shoulder in United’s win over Hull on Tuesday. However, the defender has suffered only bruising and minor ligament damage, and United’s interim boss Ryan Giggs expects him to be fit in time, even though he will miss the club’s final game of the season at Southampton tomorrow. Scroll down for videos... England boost! Wayne Rooney (L) and Phil Jones will recover from injury in time for the World Cup . ‘Phil’s injury isn’t as bad as I thought on the night,’ said Giggs. ‘He’s obviously out for Southampton but should be OK for the World Cup. We are still monitoring it but it doesn’t look too bad.’ Rooney will also miss the trip to St Mary’s, meaning he will have failed to play in United’s last three games of the season after aggravating a groin injury in training last week. It has inevitably raised concerns over the fitness of England’s talisman, but Giggs believes Rooney will benefit from the break after going into the last two World Cups struggling with injury. ‘Sunday probably will be a bit too soon for Wayne but he’ll train and be fine for the World Cup,’ said Giggs. ‘He has had a fantastic season and I think he is ready to make an impact. The injury was just a little groin strain but he’s fine. ‘He has done all the work in the gym, he trained yesterday and he’s going away next week to work on his fitness as well so the injury has probably done him a favour. He will be going into it relatively fresh.’ Lucky break! Phil Jones' injury is not as bad as first feared, although he will not appear in United's final game . Asked if this will be Rooney’s last chance to make an impact on a World Cup, at the age of 28, Giggs said: ‘Yes I think it is. Wayne is a top player and I think he is at a good age and at the peak of his powers. ‘I know he cannot wait for it. It’s exciting, a World Cup in Brazil. We have all watched Brazil teams over the years so to play in a World Cup in Brazil is something I wish I had the pleasure of doing.’ Tomorrow sees Giggs’s last game in charge as United prepare to appoint Louis van Gaal next week. They need to beat Southampton and for  Tottenham to lose at home to Aston Villa to clinch sixth place and qualify for the Europa League. Up in the air: Ryan Giggs' future at Old Trafford will be decided by the next boss, expected to be Louis van Gaal . Giggs’ future remains uncertain, both in terms of prolonging his playing career at the age of 40 and joining Van Gaal’s backroom team. He indicated on Friday that he would like to play on after extending his appearance record to 963 on Tuesday, but said the decision will rest with the new manager. ‘I loved it the other night coming on,’ he said. ‘I still enjoy training, even though I haven’t done much of it over the last couple of weeks. ‘I think it will be difficult to stop playing. It’s probably easier when you’ve had injury problems but I’ve never really had those.’ Meanwhile, England  doctors have visited Tottenham to assess full-back Kyle Walker’s fitness.‘He has not trained at all,’ said Spurs boss Tim Sherwood. ‘I suppose Roy is going to see if he wants to give Kyle time to get himself ready.’","England pair Wayne Rooney and Phil Jones are expected to return from injury in time for the World Cup .

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Leeds full-back Zak Hardaker has vowed to mend his reputation for the second time in seven months after being found guilty of homophobically abusing a referee. An independent Rugby Football League tribunal imposed a five-match suspension on the 22-year-old England international for making the offensive comments during the Rhinos' 24-6 Super League defeat at Warrington 12 days ago. Hardaker, who last week issued a public apology, admitted the offence when he appeared in front of the tribunal but claimed his remarks were aimed at Warrington captain Michael Monaghan rather than referee James Child and that he was unaware of their connotations. Disciplined: Zak Hardaker has been hit by a five-game ban after being found guilty of homophobic abuse . The tribunal accepted the player is not homophobic but were satisfied that the remarks were made to the match official. Hardaker was also fined £300 but the punishment could have been worse. The grade E charge he faced carries a ban of between four and eight matches. An RFL spokesman said: 'In handing down a five-match ban and £300 fine, the tribunal took into consideration the player's contrition, his guilty plea and evidence that he is undertaking voluntary work within the LGBT community.' Hardaker hit the headlines last November when he was thrown out of England's World Cup squad for a breach of discipline and was subsequently given a £2,500 fine and a warning by his club. The player responded with a series of impressive displays that earned him a recall to the England squad, although it is not known whether his suspension will affect his appearance at a mid-season training get-together in Loughborough this weekend. Bad boy: Hardaker was thrown out of England's World Cup squad last year after a breach of discipline . Hardaker, who will start his suspension when Leeds host Huddersfield in a Super League game at Headingley on Thursday night, pledged to learn from his latest mistake. 'Firstly, I would like to once again say sorry for any offence my comments during the Warrington game have caused,' he said in a statement posted on the club website. 'I maintain that I did not say the remark to referee James Child, however I know that I made a mistake and it does not matter who I directed the comment at, as it still causes offence to those who saw or heard it. 'I will accept the findings of the disciplinary panel and will look to put this experience to good use in terms of my professional and personal development. 'I would also like to thank all those who have shown faith in me and offered to help me, in particular Martin Owens from the Canalsiders amateur club, and hopefully the issues raised in this case will make everyone, players, officials and supporters alike more aware of the harm their words can cause.' Support: Brian McDermott says Leeds will stand by Hardaker . 'As a club and a game, we have always prided ourselves on how inclusive and welcoming our sport is and this incident, and the reaction to it, shows how seriously we all take this matter. 'We were pleased that the panel made a particular point of saying that they did not believe that Zak had meant his comment as a homophobic remark and that they considered that Zak was not homophobic. 'The club has worked hard to raise the issue of anti-homophobia in the past and we remain committed to working against all forms of discrimination.'","England star also fined £300 by RFL independent disciplinary tribunal .

"By . James Chapman . and Tamara Cohen . ED Miliband’s personal ratings are worse than those of Gordon Brown and he has ‘nothing to say’ about the issues voters care about such as immigration and welfare, senior Labour MPs are warning. Mr Miliband is facing mounting unrest over an alleged ’35 per cent strategy’, which aims to deliver victory thanks to the votes of disaffected Liberal Democrats and Commons boundaries which favour Labour. One unnamed ‘senior party staffer’ was yesterday said to have declared of Labour’s vanishing poll lead: ‘If we draw we still win.’ Ed Miliband's ratings are worse than those of Gordon Brown and he has 'nothing to say' on key issues, senior Labour MPs are warning . Labour jitters over its prospects at next year’s general election have been increased by two polls showing they have fallen behind the Conservatives for the first time for more than two years. Mr Miliband yesterday sought to dismiss questions about his suitability to lead, insisting that he and his party were focusing ‘on the issues the country is facing’. ‘The cost of living crisis, how we create good jobs with good wages in this country, including with successful British industry, how we improve the NHS - that's where Labour's focus is and that's where it will remain,’ he insisted. But he is being confronted with calls to toughen his messages on areas including immigration and welfare, where the Conservatives are seen as having outflanked Labour. One former Labour minister told the Daily Mail: ‘Ed Miliband is comfortable talking about how bad business is and rent controls and the bedroom tax. ‘He has got nothing to say about the issues that public is concerned about. He doesn’t talk about immigration. He doesn’t talk about welfare. We’re about to go into a national election [for the European parliament] under his leadership and we are not going to win it. ‘It’s not inconceivable that we could end up coming third. That would be calamitous. MPs are in a tailspin. Plenty of them are panicking. ‘Ed Miliband has had four years and hasn’t managed to shift his personal ratings and public perception of him one iota. His numbers are catastrophic – worse than IDS [Iain Duncan Smith] or Gordon Brown. No-one has ever gone on to win an election with ratings as bad as this.’ The latest ICM poll puts Labour on just 31 per cent, the lowest level of support for an opposition party a year out from a general election . It is the first time the Tories have been ahead in the polls since before the disastrous 'omnishambles' budget in 2012 . Labour MP Simon Danczuk said the two opinion polls showing the Tories back in the lead should serve as a ‘wake-up call’. ‘We’ve got some good policies - the energy price freeze, house-building, the jobs guarantee, cutting GP waiting times, helping those in the private rented sector - but we need to make sure people understand what they are,’ he said. ‘We have to make sure people understand what a Labour government will do for them. And we need people to believe what we are telling them.’ Mr Danczuk said Labour needed a strong economic message that it should ‘get out there in a clearer and sharper way’. ‘If we are to draw any positives from this, it’s good that its happened in 2014, twelve months before the election. One could argue the Tories are peaking too soon and we have time to get things moving in the right direction so it’s still all to play for.’ Labour's jitters over its prospects at next year's general election have grown, after two polls showed it had fallen behind the Tories for the first time in more than two years. But Mr Miliband yesterday insisted he and his party were focusing on 'the issues the country is facing' Mark Ferguson, editor of the unofficial party website LabourList, said: ‘No-one can say that this hasn’t been coming through. Labour’s poll share has fallen from the relative comfort of the low forties and the high thirties to the uncomfortable territory of the mid-thirties, and now downwards into the low thirties – nearing the Gordon Brown zone. ‘If these dreadful polls achieve anything, I hope it’s to shake the party – politicians, staff and activists alike – out of the torpor which appears to have overcome it. Two years of poll leads have led to drift, a lack of energy and a deficit of imagination. These polls show that Labour cannot coast to victory – in fact, they show that defeat, and a painfully crushing one, is possible.’ Mr Ferguson attacked the ‘keep calm and carry on brigade’ who ‘note without concern that Labour could still have the most seats with only 32 per cent of the vote and a two-point Tory lead’. He claimed one ‘senior party staffer’ had recently told him: ‘If we draw we still win’. Mr Ferguson condemned that attitude as ‘complacent beyond belief’. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband’s calculated political gimmicks all show the same thing. Labour hasn’t changed. They haven’t learned. They would crash our economy all over again, because they still want the high spending, borrowing and taxes that brought Britain to its knees.” ‘It is only by sticking with David Cameron and the Government’s long-term economic plan that we can ensure a more secure future for Britain, and for our children.’ A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: ‘This is a four-party dynamic. We have been talking about welfare and immigration and we will have more to say about Ukip and the reforms we want to see in Europe. ‘A 35 per cent strategy never existed. I have never heard anybody mention it. We want to win as many votes as possible.’","Labour leader faces unrest over an alleged ‘35 per cent’ election strategy .

"By . Stephen Wright . and James Slack . Madeleine: She was abducted six years ago in Portugal . Scotland Yard is to take control of the Madeleine McCann case from the Portuguese authorities, the Daily Mail can reveal. In a significant development, Home Secretary Theresa May has agreed to fund a full-scale Metropolitan Police investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance in Portugal six years ago. It follows a two-year, £5million Met review of her disappearance. This has identified more than 20 potential suspects and dozens of new leads – but despite the progress made by the review team, the Portuguese authorities have refused to reopen their inquiry. Officials in Portugal say that under the country’s laws they can only reopen the case if there is new evidence, and the new leads do not provide sufficient grounds. But Met detectives insist their leads could, if properly investigated, result in new evidence and perhaps the case being solved. With no sign of the deadlock being broken, the Met asked Mrs May to provide Home Office funding for a Scotland Yard investigation into Maddie’s disappearance. It is understood she has approved the request. It is not known how much additional funding was sought but it is believed it could run into millions of pounds. A statement announcing the Met-led investigation is expected in the next few weeks. It will endeavour not to upset the Portuguese authorities, who – privately at least – are likely to be unhappy about playing second fiddle to British police. Under the plan, Yard detectives will seek the assistance of the Portuguese to carry out some inquiries on their behalf. British police do not have jurisdiction in Portugal but they have the right to investigate and prosecute any British suspects who might be linked to Madeleine’s disappearance. Taking over: Scotland Yard is to take control of the Madeleine McCann case from the Portuguese authorities . Partnership: It is understood that Scotland Yard would ask Portuguese authorities to put any suspect on trial . Sources said that should Scotland Yard gather  sufficient evidence to prosecute a foreign national who lives overseas, they will ask the Portuguese authorities to put the suspect on trial. Madeleine was nearly four when she went missing from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on the Algarve in 2007 as her parents dined with friends nearby. The shambolic Portuguese inquiry was shelved in 2008 but Scotland Yard began a Home Office-funded review in 2011 following the intervention of David Cameron. He had been lobbied by Madeleine’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann – who were falsely accused by Portuguese police of being behind her disappearance. Officials said the progress made by the Yard review vindicated Mr Cameron’s decision to intervene. A review by the Met police identified 20 potential suspects and dozens of new leads into the disappearance of Maddy McCann . Last year the officer in day-to-day charge of the review, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, said his team had identified 195 potential leads. It emerged last month that the review had identified more than 20 people ‘of interest’, including Britons, who have not been eliminated from  the case. Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell, who supervised the Met’s review said there were a ‘good number’ of individuals who should be questioned. Well-placed sources said at least 20 potential suspects – including a number of Britons who were in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance – had not been properly eliminated. One authoritative source said last night: ‘These people include a couple of known child sex offenders who are thought may have been in the Algarve when Madeleine disappeared. More work needs to be done on establishing their movements around the time she vanished. It cannot be disputed that the Portuguese police investigation was very poor. ‘They put all their eggs in one basket in terms of the McCanns being responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance. When they were rightly eliminated, they simply closed the inquiry rather than starting again.’ It is understood that, contrary to some media reports, the Portuguese inquiry did identify everyone who was staying at the Ocean Club when she vanished. Most were British tourists. The Yard is ‘tidying’ up this aspect of the initial inquiry, trying to nail down people’s movements there. The fact that so many investigative opportunities were missed has galvanised British detectives who believe there is a real possibility they could unravel the mystery. Last month, the Mail revealed how as part of the review, Yard detectives had flown to Switzerland to probe the movements of one of the country’s most notorious child snatchers, Urs Hans von Aesch. The 67-year-old was one of many potential suspects dismissed prematurely by Portuguese police. Von Aesch kidnapped and murdered a five-year-old girl in his native Switzerland less than three months after Madeleine was abducted. He took his own life after killing his victim, who looked remarkably like Maddie.","Home Secretary Theresa May has agreed to fund full-scale Met inquiry .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Debate is currently raging over how some intricate and mysterious crop circles appeared overnight in a Californian field on Monday. The giant markings caused believers to claim that aliens had landed in Salinas Valley, while crop circle experts were quick to claim that the shape, which resembles a computer chip, is a hoax. An anonymous video has surfaced on YouTube that claims to show the first discovery of the circle, after two friends noticed flashing lights in a field and got out of their car to investigate. The first impressive pictures of the markings were taken by photographer Julie Belanger of the 111th Aerial Photography Squadron who flew over the site near Chualar, ten miles south of Salinas. Scroll down for videos . Mystery: This intricate marking cropped up in a field in California on Monday morning . Debate: Some people see the crop circle as proof of alien visitation while others think it was made by humans . Discovery? A YouTube video uploaded by an anonymous user claims to show the first finding of the circle when two friends noticed a flashing green light in the field beside the road . Berlanger told KSBW: 'It was beautiful. Quite beautiful... I believe it's possible that aliens exist, but I don't know if they would bother making a crop circle to give us a message.' The YouTube video claims to show two men finding the markings after they witnessed green flashing lights next to the road. The footage shows the men leaving their car and climbing over the fence into the field. While the green lights flicker few more times the cameraman focuses on the flattened plants. At one point one of the friends says: 'Dude, are you seeing this? Dude, this is a crop circle.' After walking in the field for a couple of minutes the men appear the panic and run back to their vehicle. 'A friend and I were driving on Chualar Canyon Road south of Salinas, California before sunrise, and THIS happened,' the YouTube user known only as Cannot Say commented on the video. View from above: Aerial photographer Julie Belanger shot the circle from a helicopter . Impressive sight: 'It was beautiful. Quite beautiful,' said the aerial photographer who shot the marking . 'Needless to say, pretty wild, but we slipped away and it's too good not to share. Created this account since I don't want this tied to me. Still not sure what to make of it.' Many people were not convinced that the markings were proof of an alien visitation. The Monterey Herald reported that the site was being protected by security guards on Monday, but they would not name the client they were working for. Jeffrey Wilson of the Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association also told the paper that there were several signs that the circles were made by human rather than extra-terrestrial life. Wilson pointed out that the marking was too well aligned with the road, the center of the circle resembled braille and that the YouTube video could have been a form of viral marketing. 'My guess is that ... it is commissioned work for an advertisement,' Wilson explained to the Herald. 'Or a commissioned work for a production company making a documentary on crop circles or for some kind of film.' Proof? The YouTube video concentrated on the flattened plants in the the field that make up the crop circle .","Complicated crop circle appeared in Salinas Valley, California, on Monday .

"By . Wills Robinson . A teenager has suffered a social media backlash after taking a selfie at Auschwitz. Breanna Mitchell, who is thought to be an American who recently graduated high school, uploaded the controversial image on Twitter with the message: 'Selfie in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp', followed by a blushing smiley face symbol. The photo has been retweeted more than 3,000 times alongside hundreds of messages of criticism. Backlash: Breanna Mitchell has received hundreds of messages of criticism after taking this selfie at Auschwitz, Nazi Germany's biggest concentration camp . But she seems to have taken the unexpected fame in her stride by sharing a news article condemning her actions with the message, 'I'm famous yall.' Originally, Mitchell said she wished people would stop tweeting about the photo. She said: 'Omg I wish people would quit tweeting to, quoting, retweeting, and favoriting my picture of my smiling in Auschwitz Concentration Camp. Like apparently is such a big deal that I smiled. Good Lord.' However she then said: 'Over 2,000 retweets on a pic that wasn't supposed to get this much attention.' As the image spread, she shared an article by Business Insider  criticising her actions with her followers. Mitchell claims she took the photo after studying the Holocaust for years with her father, who died a year ago. She said: 'That trip actually meant something to me and I was happy about it,' she tweeted, explaining the reasoning behind the smiling selfie.' The teenager has also retweeted 150 people who have supported her reason for taking the image. The complex, which consists of two areas - Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau - was originally used to house Polish political prisoners. But from spring 1942, it became the largest concentration camp operated by the Third Reich. More than 1,100,000 men, women, and children lost their lives there . According to the museum’s website, visitors are allowed to take pictures on the grounds – with the exception of a hall that contains the hair of victims, the basements of Block 11 and the gas chamber. Fame: The teenager kept her social media followers update - writing this post when the image at been retweeted 2,000 times . Excitement: She shared an article by Business Insider which condemned her controversial photo . Rules: According to the museum's website, visitors can take photos inside the grounds. However cameras are banned in gas chambers and the hall that contains the hair of victims . The camp in Nazi-occupied Poland has become a symbol of terror and genocide around the world. More than 1,100,000 men, women, and children lost their lives there . It was set up in 1940. Its first purpose was to house the increasing number of Polish prisoners arrested by Hitler's forces. But in 1942 it became the largest death camp operated by the Third Reich, with Jews, gypsies and Soviet prisoners of war also being sent. At the height of its operation, there were three main camps with thousands of prisoners in each. Inmates were subjected to inhumane conditions with no food or sanitation. Many were victims of brutal medical experiments or died in gas chambers. As the Soviet forces approached Auschwitz in January 1945, most of its population was evacuated and sent on a 'death march'. The small number who survived were liberated. In the course of the war, the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), approximately 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways remains controversial.

"By . Luke Garratt . Ms Yang posed as globetrotting Interpol agent 'Mr Li' in order to con various middle-aged single women out of money and possesions . A 54-year old Chinese woman conned victims out of thousands by claiming she was a 'superhuman' male police officer who could turn himself invisible. The con-woman, identified only as Ms Yang, duped her victims out of at least £12,000 by pretending to be 'Mr Li', an officer of Interpol and member of the Chinese Ministry of Finance with superhuman powers. According to the Telegraph, she would use this alter-ego to seduce people she met on a forum for middle-aged singles, before stealing from them. When Ms Yang became short on cash in early 2013, she allegedly faked documents to access and post on the internet forum, where she posed as 'Mr Li' a senior communist party official. She would identify her marks, chat with them, and establish the lie that she was a superhuman police officer. Her first victim was Ms Zhang, a 48-year-old woman who began a relationship with 'Mr Li' in March 2013, and by June, the couple had moved in together. Ms Zhang, who was, according to the Beijing News 'quite suspicious' was allegedly utterly taken in by the lies. The lie was continued to the point that Ms Yang would cut her hair short and deepen her voice when telling stories to Ms Zhang about how she (as Mr Li) had cracked 'major' interpol cases using his superhuman powers. The thievery began when 'Mr Li' claimed he had lost his wallet and needed money to 'recieve international friends'. Ms . Zhang lent her partner around £11,800 (120,000 yuan) under the guise . that Mr Li would repay her, and that the money would 'help him do things . for the country'. Ms Yang's fabricated character 'Mr Li' more closely resembled a comic book character like Susan Storm (The Invisible Woman) than a real-life Interpol agent, but she still managed to con thousands out of her marks . The debt was never settled, and in August 'Mr Li' vanished from Ms Zhang's life. When Ms Zhang, heartbroken, went to look for 'Mr Li' at the Ministry of Finance, she was told that he did not exist. 'Mr Li' then moved on to another person, conning a mark, a 52-year-old woman named Ms Song, out of a laptop computer. A third victim, a pensioner, was conned out of £400. Her cover was eventually blown when her first lover, Ms Zhang, approached the police looking for 'Mr Li', beofre being told that 'Mr Li never existed, and was actually a 54-year-old woman. Ms Yang had previously spent 11 years in jail for fraud, and will not go on trial for the second time.

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Martin Robinson . A reporter has admitted phone hacking while at the Sunday Mirror. Dan Evans said he was involved in illegal hacking at the newspaper before he was recruited to join its rival the News of the World. He has pleaded guilty to two charges of phone hacking at the two papers – the first journalist to admit hacking outside of the News of the World. Job offer: Dan Evans, left, said he secured a £53,000-a-year role with the News of the World after a meeting with Andy Coulson, right, who he says knew he had hacked phones, the Old Bailey heard yesterday . Evans, 38, told the Old Bailey . yesterday he was ‘tasked’ with targeting the phones of celebrities after . he was given a staff job on the Sunday Mirror in 2003. The illegal . hacking won him a string of exclusives and he was then approached to . join the News of the World and interviewed by its then editor Andy . Coulson. Evans said he had discussed the illegal practice with . Coulson at the interview in 2004. He said: ‘I moved on to voicemail . interception, told him how I had a lot of commercially sensitive data . inside my head, my lists... that I could bring him big exclusive stories . cheaply. ‘It was a ker-ching moment really: Big exclusive stories cheaply equals job.’ Evans . said Coulson, who later became David Cameron’s communications chief, . had seemed ‘really pleased’ and he had got the job. Mr Evans said: 'I told him about my . background, the sort of stories I had been doing. Almost the sort of . stuff I had been through before. 'I . got onto voicemails and interception and I told him I had a lot of . commercially sensitive data in my head and how things worked at the . Sunday Mirror and I could bring him big exclusive stories cheaply which . was the kerching moment. Bring exclusive stories cheaply equals job.' Criminality: Evans, pictured leaving court, said he had intercepted voicemails at the Sunday Mirror but did not want to become the News of the World's 'pet phone hacker' Over breakfast he said he told . Coulson: 'You could go out on an investigation, spend a long period of . time getting under the skin of a greasy public interest issue. 'The . other is you dial up somebody's phone and call the list, work out who . they are having a relationship with, hack their phones, voicemails and . pin down exclusive photos'. The term ‘phone . hacking’ was not used then, he said, but added: ‘Andy knew what the . context of it was.’ Evans had turned down chances to leave . the Sunday Mirror because he did not want to become a 'pet phone . hacker', for James Weatherup, who was already working at the NotW, he . said. Evans discussed . the practice with staff from the newspaper when they had their first . meeting to discuss a possible job, the court heard. He . said: 'Voicemail interception became part of the conversation. It was . not referred to as phone hacking - that phrase did not exist then.' At a second meeting at the same bar with Weatherup, they were joined by another NOTW staff member, who cannot be named. Evans said: 'He sat down and said ""I know you can screw phones, what else can you do?' ' To which Evans, 38, replied: 'Quite a lot, actually. I told him I was an investigative reporter.' His third meeting was with Andy Coulson, he said. Mr Evans was offered the job the same day and he started at NOTW on January 5 2005 on a salary of £53,000 and was given a list of around 100 targets including Simon Cowell, . David Beckham, Michael Barrymore and Michael Jackson, he told the jury. On his first day, Mr Evans said he was taken into a meeting room and handed a contacts list by a NOTW journalist who cannot be named. He started at the News of the World in January . 2005 . He said he probably hacked phones more than 1,000 times. Job: Evans said he was 'crestfallen' when on his first day at the NotW he was handed a contacts list of celebrities to try to target, including Simon Cowell and Chris Evans, the court heard . He was given . a cash advance to buy pay-as-you-go phones that were nicknamed . ‘burners’ because they were used for ‘illicit activities’ and would be . destroyed or ‘burned’. Evans said he was discovered when he used his . work phone, not a ‘burner’, to target interior designer Kelly Hoppen. She won a court order forcing Vodafone to reveal the identity of her . would-be hacker. Among . the names were Heather McCartney, Simon Cowell, Esther Rantzen, Chris Evans, Ed . Balls, Ronnie Biggs, Elle Macpherson, Katie Price, Jodie Marsh, Michael Parkinson, John Leslie, Geri Halliwell and Michael . Jackson. Convicted hacker Dan Evans told the court he was caught after a 'moronic' mistake. The 38-year-old had tried to access the voicemails of designer Kelly Hoppen (right) - but accidentally used his own phone which was later traced. He said: 'I made a fundamental blunder. In a moment of panic I tried to hack her phone and failed miserably and she re-set the security system. 'She received an alert that someone had tried to enter the wrong PIN number in the system.' Hoppen then got a legal order to find out which phone number had called her, and this was Evans' work phone. He told the court that in the past he would have used a phone that could be discarded, or 'a burner', but due to budget constraints and following the conviction of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and former NoTW royal editor Clive Goodman for phone hacking in 2007 no longer had access to such handsets. When asked why he had used his own handset, Evans told the court: 'I was a moron.' Mr Evans said he was rather 'crestfallen' at being given the task. Asked . how many of the numbers he hacked, Mr Evans said there were 80-100 . names on the list and his department were spending a 'couple of grand a . week' on data, including phone numbers. Mr Evans told the court that he . would hack phones 'probably most days' while at the News of the World, . and that he had accessed voicemails more than 1,000 times. 'Not as many as at the Sunday Mirror but quite a lot,' he said. He claimed . that the newspaper used a company that could provide personal . information including phone humbers, credit activity, telephone bills, . medical and tax records within three hours. Most of the NoTW features department's budget went on paying for stories like kiss and tells, Mr Evans told the jury. He said: 'Dark arts were applied to generate leads and tips which would often be locked down with the aid of a cheque book.' The court heard that Evans has already admitted conspiracy to hack phones at the Sunday Mirror between February 2003 and January 2005, and the same offence at the News of the World between April 2004 and June 2010. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office between January 2008 and June 2010, and perverting the course of justice by giving a false statement in High Court proceedings. Evans told the jury that he was involved in hacking at the Sunday Mirror for about a year and a half from 2003 when he was given a staff job, but it had been going on before that. Asked by prosecutor Andrew Edis QC what his job at the Sunday Mirror was, Evans said: 'I was a news reporter. Principally I was tasked with covering news events, investigations, undercover work, latterly with hacking people's voicemail.' Accusations: Evans told the court that he hacked phones 'most days' while at the News of the World but did it more at the Sunday Mirror . Former NotW editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks are on trial accused of conspiring with others to hack phones and misconduct in a public office. Brooks is also charged with perverting the course of justice. The pair deny the charges against them along with five other defendants in the case. The trial continues.

"By . James Tozer . Criticism: Barrister Kate Blackwell, who was criticised for the tough questioning of a sex assault victim who later committed suicide tried to claim the case's notoriety meant she should escape a driving ban . A barrister criticised for the tough questioning of a sex assault victim who later committed suicide tried to claim the case’s notoriety meant she should escape a driving ban. Kate Blackwell QC argued she had been ‘vilified’ after the case and insisted it would not be safe for her  to use public transport because she and her children had been sent threatening letters. But her argument, after she was caught speeding at 63mph in a 40mph zone, failed when magistrates rejected her claims that the publicity had left her vulnerable. Miss Blackwell defended former choirmaster Michael Brewer last year at his trial for sex offences. But she was attacked for her tough cross-examination of violinist Frances Andrade – whom Brewer abused as a schoolgirl. Less than a week later Mrs Andrade, a 48-year-old mother of four, took a fatal overdose. Her family said she had not been able to face being called a ‘liar’ and a ‘fantasist’ in court. Brewer and his wife Hilary were later both found guilty of indecent assault, with the judge stressing he had no concerns about Miss Blackwell’s line of questioning. This week the barrister, 44, attempted to use the public anger the case provoked to avoid receiving a driving ban. Blackwell, herself a mother of four, was recorded speeding in south Manchester last September. With nine points already on her licence, the QC – who appeared under her married name, Katherine Rogelj – faced an automatic ban. But Buxton magistrates were  told a ban would be an exceptional hardship, particularly with her now ex-husband spending most of his time  living in Slovenia. Miss Blackwell claimed publicity around the Brewer trial had left her fearful of using public transport. She told magistrates: ‘I was representing the defendant facing historical sexual offences and shortly after I cross-examined the complainant she committed suicide.’ Richard Silver, defending, told the court: ‘She hadn’t done anything other than her correct duty.’ Miss Blackwell was asked by Mr Silver: ‘Is it right you were vilified in the Press for that case.’ She replied: ‘Yes.’ He continued: ‘And received threatening letters in which you and your children were threatened? And your photograph was published in the papers?’ She replied: ‘Yes. I was also followed back to chambers on several occasions.’ Mr Silver went on: ‘Do you have a concern if you have to use public transport?’ Miss Blackwell replied: ‘Yes.’ Tough: Miss Blackwell was attacked for her tough cross-examination of violinist Frances Andrade (right) during the trial of former choirmaster Michael Brewer (left). Less than a week later Mrs Andrade took a fatal overdose . He added a road ban would make it almost impossible for her to get to various courts with her heavy caseload. But chairman of the bench, Hilary Batterbee, rejected his argument, telling Miss Blackwell: ‘The reason you work in various locations and are transporting large amount of boxes and files will be very difficult, but we believe other arrangements would be made.’ Miss Blackwell, of Didsbury, Manchester, had five points imposed and was banned for six months, although this was suspended pending appeal. She was ordered to pay a £650 fine and £100 costs. Brewer, now 69, who was director of music at renowned Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester in the 1980s, was convicted of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade when she was 14 and 15 but cleared of raping her. His ex-wife was jailed for 21 months after she was convicted of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade when she was 18. After the death of Mrs Andrade, who taught the violin at a £25,000-a-year girls’ school in Surrey, rape support groups said judges needed to do more to ensure trials were not ‘reduced to an attack on the witness’. In April a review concluded Mrs Andrade’s suicide ‘could and should have been prevented’, directing particular criticism at mental health teams for refusing her therapy until after the trial despite previous overdoses. It also recommended police and prosecutors remain in contact with vulnerable witnesses after they have finished giving evidence.","Kate Blackwell QC criticised for questioning of victim Frances Andrade .

"By . Jill Reilly . A New York teenager has opened the world's first sneaker pawnshop where other youngsters can  deposit their valuable trainers in return for cash. The shop, which is the brainchild of Chase Reed, 16, from Harlem, stocks high-end designer models which are often high value because they are limited edition. Chase came up with the idea for Sneaker Pawn after asking his father, Troy, if he could borrow $50 (£29) just days after being bought a pair of expensive trainers. A New York teenager has opened the world's first sneaker pawnshop where other youngsters can  deposit their valuable trainers in return for cash. Pictured: Nike Air Yeezys designed in collaboration with the rapper Kanye West . Troy told the New York Post: 'I was like, ‘Are you serious?’ I’m holding these sneakers until I get my $50 back.' The pair then opened the store - Chase sold his own 200-strong collection of trainers to raise funds for the opening. Troy works in the shop during school hours, but the 10th grader works there after school and at weekends. Shoes are only admitted once they have passed the smell test and owners are then given cash - they can redeem their sneakers at a later date or allow them to be sold. Before any sale owners have first refusal and receive 80 per cent of the proceeds if they decide for it to go ahead. Customers usually borrow around $100 per pair of lightly-worn trainers, although one was lent thousands of dollars after taking in a pair of sought-after Nike LeBron Crown Jewels and two pairs of Nike Air Jordans. They must repay the loan at a rate of 20 per cent. The shop, which is the brainchild of Chase Reed, 16, from Harlem, stocks high-end designer models which are often high value because they are limited edition (file photo) Mr Reed said: 'Young kids don’t have jewellery. They don’t have cars. But what they do have is the thousands of dollars worth of sneakers in their house. 'After we evaluate them, we’ll give the kid, say, $100 for the sneakers. If he wants them back, he’ll pay the $100, plus $20 for storing the sneakers.' The pair said customers have pawned trainers for reasons indulging funeral costs,  and two teenage girls who wanted cash to buy prom dresses. The owner of the LeBron Crown Jewels used the money to move to the Bronx from Brooklyn. In recent years limited edition and exclusive trainers have become big business. A pair of Air Jordan 1s that were . autographed by the basketball great himself once sold at auction for . $60,000 - so Kanye West is a long way off entering the 'most expensive . sneaker hall of fame'. However, . it took just 11 minutes for the hip hop mogul's special edition Nike . sneakers to sell out after a surprise release was announced by . the shoe giant - and about the same time for them to start and be . hawked on eBay. The shoes, called the Air Yeezy II Red Octobers, retailed for $245. They are currently on sale on eBay for between $1,700 and $15,000. In December chaos followed the release of Nike's Air Jordan 11 Gamma Blue sneaker as fights broke out in stores across the country between customers keen to get their hands on a pair. Each year, the highly anticipated release of a new version of limited edition Air Jordans is released and each year, a spate of robberies, assaults, riots and even deaths occur. In 2012, Joshua Woods, 22, was killed in Houston, Texas shortly after buying a pair of newly-released Air Jordans by four men who followed him from the mall. His mother, Dazie Williams, has launched a campaign called Life Over Fashion which aims to change the way Nike distributes its sought-after sneakers. 'Nike nor Michael Jordan didn’t pull the trigger that killed my son, but with great power comes great responsibility. It’s product liability. If your name is on a product, you have to stand up. 'The first person that got killed [for Jordans] was in 1989, and here we are in 2013,' she said.","The shop, which is the brainchild of Chase Reed, 16, from Harlem .

"By . Emily Crane . A wearable sensor made of gold wires has been created by Australian scientists and could help develop an electronic skin capable of monitoring a person's blood pressure, pulse and heartbeat. The highly sensitive wire used for the pressure sensor is as thin as human skin and could also potentially be used to design cheap phone or tablet touch screens that are prone to cracking. Monash University's Dr Wenlong Cheng said the sensor had great potential for monitoring people's health anytime and anywhere. Scroll down for video . The highly sensitive wire could help develop an electronic skin capable of monitoring a person's blood pressure, pulse and heartbeat . Monash University's Dr Wenlong Cheng said the sensor had great potential for monitoring people's health anytime and anywhere . 'The sensors are flexible, yet robust and our testing showed they could be used for checking such things as blood pressure, blood pulse and heartbeat. These results have particular implications for future ""at-home"" diagnostic tools for elderly or disabled people,' Dr Cheng said. The researchers from the university and the Melbourne Centre for Nanofabrication used the thinnest gold wire produced to design the sensor, which is about two nanometres thick – a nanometre is one billionth of a metre. 'We chose the ultrathin gold nanowires because they are mechanically flexible and have good conductivity, yet are very robust which makes them highly suitable for wearable devices,' Dr Cheng said. The sensor's robust flexibility means it could be worn as a diagnostic device to detect blood pressure or pulse in real time and under various conditions, including during exercise or sleep. Dr Cheng said while the team had only produced a patch-size sensor at this stage, the fabrication process could easily be replicated on a much larger scale. The research was published in Nature Communications.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Loss: Edward Harris, 3, died after climbing into a pool behind his daycare center on Thursday . A three-year-old boy has drowned in a swimming pool at the New York daycare where his mother works. Edward Harris had wandered past a gate and into the garden while his mom, Maria Johnson, 22, was inside the Mother Byrd Family Day Care Center on Staten Island on Thursday. At around 5.40pm, she realized her son was not with his grandfather, who had just taken them on an errand, and saw the boy floating in the water and pulled him out, the New York Times reported. His grandfather, Robert Battipaglia, a former lifeguard, rushed to the boy and attempted to give him CPR and the youngster vomited over him as he did so - but still he could not be revived. Battipaglia, . who thought that Johnson was watching her son through a window . overlooking the yard, said he was struggling with the knowledge he had . not reached his step-grandson quick enough. 'I . was the first person to respond, but I got there too late,' he said. 'I'll never be able to live this down 'til the day I die.' When paramedics arrived, Edward was in cardiac arrest and responders tried to revive him. Tragedy: A police car sits outside the Staten Island daycare center where the tragedy unfolded . He was rushed to Richmond University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. 'He was a good, happy boy, his mother told the New York Daily News. 'He was my only son.' Edward had taken off all of his clothes before jumping in the pool, Johnson's cousin Anjie Johnson said. Sources told the New York Post the boy had stacked up boxes, climbed them and jumped in. Danger: There is only a fence (seen top) to separate the daycare from the swimming pool. The boy was found floating in the water about 10 minutes after he was last seen and could not be saved . 'He was a very fast-moving kid,' she said. 'In a second, if you look away he won't be where you told him to be... She's trying hard to deal with it, but it's hard.' The daycare center, owned by Sherris Byrd, is licensed to take of 12 children, according to records of the Office of Children and Family Services. A police spokesman said investigators believed the boy's death was an accident. The medical examiner has yet to release the cause of death.

"By . Lina Das . As half of the singing duo Simon & Garfunkel, Art Garfunkel has been described as having one of the greatest voices in pop. Alongside songwriter Paul Simon, his angelic tones on hits such as Bridge Over Troubled Water, The Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair and Mrs Robinson helped to turn them into one of the most popular singing duos in the world. So when Garfunkel suffered serious vocal chord problems four years ago, leading to the loss of his trademark sound and cancellation of the duo’s 2010 tour, you might have expected Simon to have been supportive. Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon in happier times in 1984 performing at Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles . Simon and Garfunkel during a live performance on NBC's Saturday Night in 1975 in New York . ‘He wasn’t particularly. But no, I’m not upset,’ says Garfunkel tersely. He pauses, then adds: ‘But I’m used to the fact that we’re just different characters.’ The duo may have harmonised exquisitely on stage but their 60-year relationship off it — they met at junior school and were trying to broker a record contract together by the time they were teenagers — has been stormy. You can ask Garfunkel, 72, about anything — his friendship with Jack Nicholson, his love affairs, even the suicide of an ex-girlfriend — and he will answer. It is only when the topic of Paul Simon crops up that the temperature starts to chill slightly. They broke up spectacularly, and very publicly, in 1970, soon after the release of their seminal album Bridge Over Troubled Water. Simon is said to have resented his dependence on Garfunkel to interpret the songs he wrote, and Garfunkel resented Simon’s resentment. There was a row over a tour. The duo, who had a very public falling out in the 1970s, performing at Madison Square Garden in 1972 . ‘That was our worst-ever fight,’ says Garfunkel. ‘After all that shouting we called it quits.’ They have reunited to perform and even tour together several times over the decades since, but Simon said recently that he will never record with Garfunkel again ‘because that would be revisiting the past’. Garfunkel once said that his relationship with Simon ‘causes me far more pain than my relationships with anybody else I could name’, although now he demurs. ‘Did I say that? That doesn’t feel right, although I guess we are deep old friends, and when there’s depth there, there’s going to be shade as well as light.’ Garfunkel once said that his relationship with Simon 'causes me far more pain than my relationships with anybody else I could name' When Garfunkel was pursuing a successful solo career in 1979 — his single Bright Eyes, from the film Watership Down, was the UK’s biggest seller that year — his girlfriend, 25-year-old actress Laurie Bird, committed suicide. The couple had been together for several years and Garfunkel took the loss hard. During performances of Scarborough Fair, Bird would often come to his mind. ‘Especially when I sang the line Remember me to one who lives there / She once was a true love of mine,’ he says. ‘I don’t feel the loss as palpably as I did years ago, but the first four or five years were life-stopping. I was very introverted in the Eighties. I stayed at home and communed with my memories and Laurie’s diaries, and read Dylan Thomas and Yeats. ‘I went all “high artist” on myself and couldn’t face the world. ‘Then I started hanging out with Penny Marshall. She’s a great film director and actress who’s just so light and funny that she helped bring me out of myself. We had a million laughs, the sex was good and it got me out of my introversion. We’re still friends, but I’m a married guy now — my heart is elsewhere.’ These days Garfunkel’s heart belongs to actress and singer Kim Cermak, 56, his wife of 25 years. Garfunkel with his wife Kim Cermak at the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award's in Los Angeles in 2008 . Of the 16-year age gap between them, he says: ‘It doesn’t seem to bother us at all and, actually, I love that she’s younger than me. There’s a nice amount of differentness between us: I’m urban and she’s Midwest; I’m much more cerebral and she’s way sweeter than I am and free of a lot of my thorniness. We slip together pretty naturally.’ It’s his second marriage. His first, to architect Linda Marie Grossman, ended in the Seventies after just three years. He and Kim have two children — James, 23, who is also a singer (‘he’s better than me and sings higher than I do!’) and eight-year-old Beau Daniel, who was born via a surrogate. ‘We wanted a second child and I sometimes wondered if it would ever happen. But it finally did 15 years later, which is lovely and  very unusual. Garfunkel in the 1980 movie Bad Timing alongside Theresa Russell . ‘At my age, it was a wonderful shot of new life and I can say to all daddies who are getting on in years, it’s spiritually and poetically magnificent to have a child later in life. ‘Now that I’m older, the godliness of a child speaks powerfully to me. In my 20s I was chasing the charts and the fun of artistic projects, and in my 30s I was self-involved. It was only once I hit my mid-40s that I realised it wasn’t all about me and that life was about giving life.’ Garfunkel’s pursuit of artistic projects wasn’t limited to music. After recording the soundtrack to the Mike Nichols film The Graduate, which included the 1968 hit Mrs Robinson, both Garfunkel and Simon — who went on to marry actress Carrie Fisher — began to harbour acting ambitions. Nichols signed the duo to act in his 1970 movie adaptation of Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22, but Simon’s minor part in it ended up on the cutting-room floor. That Garfunkel was given fourth billing was said to be another factor in their parting. Simon has said he will never record with Garfunkel again as that would be like 'revisiting the past' In 1971, Nichols put Garfunkel into Carnal Knowledge, co-starring with Jack Nicholson as college room-mates. ‘We became buddies,’ Garfunkel says. ‘He’s not the frivolous man people think he is. But those were fun times and fame was a big kick. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!’And the best part of fame? ‘The girls were a big thing,’ he says after a moment’s reflection, ‘because suddenly you’re not such a loner and not so different from everyone else.’ Growing up in New York, that incredible voice initially set him apart from the other kids. ‘I started singing in echoing apartment block stairwells when I was five and I knew I was different from a very young age,’ he says. ‘I was a loner and I was lonesome. ‘Then I met Paul Simon at  school when I was 11. He was another guy who loved music. Finally, I felt understood.’ And for all their ups and downs, it’s that memory that remains. ‘Forget the other stuff,’ says Garfunkel gently. ‘This is what Simon & Garfunkel is all about.’ Could the pair ever work together again? ‘Well, we don’t speak that often, but I think the world of him as a great musician and an interesting cat,’ he says carefully. ‘But it takes two to tango. We’ll just have to see what chance brings.’ Garfunkel — minus Simon — will be touring the UK in September. While the hair might not be the blond halo it once was, his honeyed tones are still much in evidence. ‘When I had vocal problems for a few years, I’ll admit I didn’t know how to be me,’ he says. ‘It’s a real thrill to have my voice back and to shape this new show. ‘There are three parts to it: I’ll sing and I’ll be doing some of our old hits; I’ll read some things I’ve been writing for the past 30 years; then I’ll answer questions from the audience. I try to be candid and it’s nice to share all these memories. I mean, ain’t I a lucky duck?’* Art Garfunkel’s UK tour starts on September 5.

"By . James Tozer . Two drivers have been arrested after a young couple died when a pair of high-powered Audis crashed into their car while allegedly racing at 90mph. Witnesses spoke of a horrifying screech of brakes, followed by bangs after the black sports cars smashed into a Vauxhall Corsa pulling out of a side road. The crash left Aaron Jones, 19, and his 22-year-old girlfriend Amy Hobson fatally injured. Two drivers have been arrested after Amy Hobson, 22, and Aaron Jones, 19, died after two Audis collided with their Vauxhall Corsa in Swinton, near Manchester . Would-be rescuers said they were met by a horrific scene, with the Corsa hit so hard its engine was flung from the vehicle. As police were preparing to question the two men on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, Mr Jones’ distraught parents said they were still half-expecting him to walk through the front door and say: ‘Aha – fooled you.’ The tragedy happened as his white Corsa pulled on to the A580 in Swinton, Greater Manchester on Sunday afternoon with mother-of-one Miss Hobson in the front passenger seat. Witnesses . said an Audi RS3, which is capable of doing  155mph, and a 151mph Audi . S3 were being driven at high speeds when the drivers lost control. They smashed into the victims’ car, with the passenger side taking the brunt of the impact. The . RS3 rolled several times before hitting the central reservation and . finally a lamp post. One of the Audis is said to have burst into flames. According to witnesses, the two Audis were travelling at speeds of up to 90mph before the collision . Mr Jones died at the scene while his girlfriend, who had a three-year-old son called Alfie, was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead a short time later. One witness said: ‘I heard the impact, a horrifying screech of brakes then bangs and dust flying up. Aaron Tulsa Jones, 19, and girlfriend Amy Louise Hobson, 22, were driving along the A580 East Lancs road in Salford, Manchester when two Audis ploughed into them . Both Audis were damaged but one caught fire. People were running out of a nearby golf club to help. We believe one clipped the other before the crash. It was just a horrible sight.’ Motorist Lynne Scanlan said: ‘We saw a lady being given CPR on the road and there looked to be cars just strewn everywhere.’ Yesterday, Mr Jones’s father Rob, 49, said: ‘He had a heart of gold. He had lots of friends. Everybody he met just took to him. ‘I just can’t believe he’s gone. I keep expecting him to walk through the door.’ The couple had been together for about a year after meeting while working at McDonald’s in Pendlebury. Mr Jones’s father said the family were desperate to contact Miss Hobson’s so they could support each other and return some of her precious belongings. Their son was also a black-belt in karate. He and Miss Hobson were instructors at a local club. Clare Lord, operations manager north for McDonald’s UK, said: ‘Aaron and Amy were popular, valued friends and colleagues and will be dearly missed.’ On Twitter, Jack Hinds posted: ‘R.I.P Amy Hobson & Aaron Jones. Racing cars on public roads is totally wrong.’ Police have appealed for witnesses.  The suspects are aged 27 and 25. One suffered a back injury in the crash. He was in hospital last night as detectives wait until he is well enough to be questioned. The other was  in  custody. Films in the Fast and Furious series have been blamed for glamorising street racing. Police forces around the country have placed exclusion orders on popular gathering sites for racers. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years in prison.

The 25-year-old smiled and laughed while walking into the stadium ahead of boyfriend Andy Murray’s third-round match against Roberto Bautista Agut of Argentina on Centre Court today. Keeping her long hair in its straight, sleek style, Kim chose a below-the-knee white linen skirt from Hobbs, teamed with a laid-back cropped Levi denim jacket, black lace top, and funky leopard-print ballet pumps.

Once again the artist, who has been dating Murray for nine years and lives with him in Surrey, carried her beloved £1,395 cream Marylebone tote from Aspinal of London, which she has so far brought to every game. Her cheerful attitude is no doubt a result of Andy’s stellar performances in Wimbledon thus far, having won his last two games - the last one in incredible straight sets. And, as with most of the tennis champion’s matches throughout his career, Kim has been avidly watching each set from the side-lines. Despite the media spotlight, Kim has not once faltered when it comes to fashion choices, choosing a white lace dress with cork wedges and a block print swallow dress with the same shoes for Andy's previous victorious matches.

Despite his excellent form so far, Murray's game against Agut promises to be a nail-biting match, with his place in Wimbledon - where he is defending his title - hanging in the balance. However, despite the undoubted pressure he is no doubt feeling, having Kim by his side will be a comfort. Murray, 27, has famously praised her ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship.

"By . Richard Moore . There could still be a place for Sir Bradley Wiggins at Team Sky despite saying his Grand Tour days are behind him, insists Sir Dave Brailsford. The Team Sky chief was responding to the rider’s claim that road cycling is cut-throat, whereas the track ‘feels more like a family and a closer-knit group of people.’ He said: ‘We’re talking to Bradley and his management team and ideally we’d like to find a solution to support him through to Rio (the 2016 Olympic Games).

Brailsford was performance director of British Cycling, a position he left this year, but he said he would still be willing to support Wiggins’ track ambition. It would be on a drastically reduced salary, though. Wiggins is paid around £3million a year by Sky, a deal agreed after he won the 2012 Tour de France and which ends in December. Whether or not he stays could depend on whether he is willing to stay for a fraction of that. ‘I think he’s made it quite clear himself he’d like to finish his career in Rio,’ added Brailsford. ‘If you want to get there at the level required, they saw (in Glasgow) that they’ve got some good foundations but they’ve got work to do as well.’ Brailsford didn’t rule out a return to the Tour de France by Wiggins, saying: ‘Physically he has another Tour in him, I’m sure, but it’s hard work to get ready for a Grand Tour.

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Manchester United players looked to be in a relaxed mood as they headed out for another pre-season training session in Los Angeles on Monday. The likes of Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Darren Fletcher were all smiles as Japan star Shinji Kagawa signed autographs for fans outside the team's hotel. Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata enjoyed a trip to the famous Beverly Hills sign as the attacking pair posed for photographs before chatting to MUTV. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal and his new squad touch down in the US . Tourists: Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata pose in front of the Beverly Hills sign as part of their pre-season tour . All smiles: The Manchester United players looked in a relaxed mood as they left the Beverly Wilshere Hotel . Ed Woodward has told United fans to expect new signings and several departures over the next few weeks. Louis . van Gaal has already spent upwards of £50million on Luke Shaw and Ander . Herrera, but the new United boss looks set to add more faces before the . season begins. The Dutchman has been linked with Arturo Vidal, Daley Blind, Kevin Strootman and Thomas Vermaelen since taking charge in May. Van Gaal is already making space for new acquisitions by off loading Patrice Evra, who may seal his transfer to Juventus on Monday. Woodward says there is plenty of cash available to Van Gaal if he decides he needs to strengthen further. 'There is no fixed budget. Financially we are extremely strong, we have funds available,' United's executive vice-chairman told MUTV in an interview filmed on the club's pre-season tour of the United States. 'Louis is the boss and is assessing what's going on but we have been in dialogue for some time about targets so there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes... we're continuing to move forward on some of those targets... so watch this space. Happy faces: The United stars pose with fans during their pre-season trip . 'The time he (Van Gaal) spends here as well (in America) he'll be able to assess more what he's got and continue to tweak the decisions if we need to.'We want to do what it takes to win the title.' United finished seventh under David Moyes last year, meaning they will be without European football this term for the first time in almost two decades. Woodward does not believe that will put potential signings off a move to Old Trafford, though.He added: 'I've experienced a lot of conversations with agents and players and we are still a huge attraction to top football stars around the world - there is no doubt about that. 'We've already invested in two new fantastic players.' As a consequence of the club's failure to qualify for Europe, United will play a vastly reduced number of matches this season. In charge: Louis van Gaal (left) and Ryan Giggs watch on during a United training session . Van Gaal will therefore need fewer players, so there is a high possibility that some squad members will be moved on before the transfer window closes. Evra will follow Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic out of the door despite only signing a new contract two months ago. Press Association Sport understands the France international is closing in on a move to Turin and could even be announced as a Juventus player on Monday. Midfielder Anderson, who was loaned to Fiorentina last season, and misfiring striker Bebe are free to leave. The likes of Javier Hernandez, Wilfried Zaha, Marouane Fellaini, Anderson and Tom Cleverley all have question marks over their futures. Nice to see you: Shinji Kagawa signs autographs for fans outside the team hotel . When asked whether players would leave, Woodward said: 'Yes, I think so. 'The manager makes that decision and a few players have already gone and there may well be a few others that go. 'It's also worth commenting that we're not in Europe this year (so) there's less games, maybe the manager takes the view that he wants a tighter squad to bed in. 'If you do the analysis over last year, Liverpool performed extremely well with a smaller number of players but that's a decision for the manager.' Woodward is convinced the United boss will not shy away from making any tough calls. Eyes elsewhere: Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley watch on with Van Gaal as they grab a breather . Ready for the new season: Rooney talks to MUTV during his visit to Beverly Hills . 'We've got someone who has confidence in himself about making difficult decisions and, when you boil down what makes a great manager, one of the key characteristics is making difficult decisions and we've clearly got a manager who can do that,' Woodward added. 'I've personally found him very warm. He's a very clear communicator and very direct. I like that in people; I'm a very direct person myself.' Failing to qualify for Europe was a big blow to United, who have won the Champions League on three occasions. Charges: Van Gaal is expected to name a strong side for United's pre season opener against LA Galaxy . Together: The United players leave the Beverly Wilshere hotel ahead of training . Woodward wants an instant return to the biggest competition in European football, but he also stressed his desire for United to challenge for the Barclays Premier League too. 'We're a club that absolutely should be in the Champions League,' he said. 'That's what our fans want, that's what our players want and that's what every member of staff wants. Good laugh: Luke Shaw and Wilfried Zaha head down to the training field ahead of a session with Van Gaal . Pre-season: Wayne Rooney looked in a relaxed mood as he boards the Manchester United team coach . 'We have to strive to win. We're not here to be an also-ran; we're here to win trophies to add to that huge, incredible list that we've won over many years.' Van Gaal may have been in his post for only five days, but Woodward says the 62-year-old, who led . Holland to the last four of the World Cup, has already made a big impact. 'I'm hearing a lot of good feedback from a lot of people about him and there is a huge amount of goodwill towards him and the coaching staff,' Woodward said. 'Every interaction he's having with people is leaving an imprint, which is superb.' Support: United fans line-up outside their team's hotel as they hope to catch a glimpse of the players .

"By . Associated Press . An Ohio woman has been sentenced to 32 years in prison for enslaving a mentally disabled woman in her home for nearly two years through intimidation, threats and abuse. Jessica Hunt, 33, was convicted in March of forced labor, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to illegally obtain prescription drugs. She was sentenced on Thursday. Hunt's boyfriend, 28-year-old Jordie . Callahan, was sentenced on Tuesday to 30 years in federal prison for those . same charges. Both are from Ashland, about 70 miles southwest of . Cleveland. This undated file photo released by the Ashland County Sheriff's Office shows Jessica L. Hunt. A jury in March found Jordie Callahan, 27, guilty of forced labor, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and a drug charge . The couple were accused of holding the woman captive from early 2011 to late 2012. Prosecutors alleged that they threatened to harm the woman's young daughter if the woman did not do chores, shop and clean up after their pit bull dogs. The couple also used the dogs and a python to threaten the woman into complying, prosecutors said. The couple's attorneys have argued that government witnesses were unreliable, including the victim in the case, who suffers from the effects of a traumatic brain injury suffered in a car accident. The woman had numerous opportunities to tell people she was being mistreated, including appointments at social service agencies, attorneys for Hunt and Callahan have said. After the woman was caught stealing candy in late 2012, she told police she wanted to go to jail because people were being mean to her. Prosecutors say the couple lured her into the home knowing she received government assistance. Prosecutors alleged that Callahan had sex with the woman and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. The couple also were accused of injuring the woman and forcing her to go to the emergency room so they could take any painkillers that would be prescribed to her, trial testimony and documents showed. Two more people were convicted in the case for helping the couple enslave the woman. They pleaded guilty and agreed to testify at the trial. Dezerah McGuire, 33, formerly Dezerah Silsby, received a 45-month prison sentence in April.

"By . James Tozer . 'Extreme views': Suspected Boko Haram ringleader Aminu Sadiq Ogwuche appears to  ave become radicalised while studying at a university in Wales . A leading figure in Islamist terror group Boko Haram was born in Britain and first radicalised at a Welsh university. Aminu Sadiq Ogwuche, 29, was arrested in Sudan this week on suspicion of killing more than 90 people in bomb attacks in Nigeria. He will also be quizzed on what he knows about the more than 270 schoolgirls kidnapped and held hostage in the rainforest by Boko Haram. It has now emerged that Ogwuche called himself ‘The Lion of God’ while at the University of Glamorgan, and threatened to chop off the hands and feet of Christians and atheists. He began studying for a degree in business science in 2007 before dropping out three years later and his Facebook postings show how he became more extreme over time. By 2011 he was writing: ‘The only punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is that they should be murdered, or crucified, or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides, or they should be imprisoned.’ Yesterday former friends expressed their shock at his alleged involvement in a terror group fast becoming one of the most feared in the world. Ogwuche was caught in Sudan after a reward of £100,000 was offered for his capture over two bombings in the Nigerian capital Abuja last month. He was born in Britain before joining the Nigerian Army, where he worked in an intelligence unit. Ogwuche deserted in 2006 – and then returned to Britain for his university studies. While studying he lived in Pontypridd, and claims he was a member of his university debating society. On an online profile he says: ‘I used to be in the military back at home and my goal now is to be a successful businessman.’ Scroll down for video . Terrified: Boko Haram are holding nearly 300 schoolgirls hostage (above) after kidnapping them from a school in Nigeria last month .

"By . Gareth Rose . Alex Salmond has broken his promise not to politicise the Commonwealth Games quicker than a Usain Bolt sprint by declaring Glasgow will become the ‘Freedom city’. As Scotland’s athletes prepared for the 11 biggest days of their lives, the First Minister resorted to his tired old ‘Braveheart’ rhetoric. He claimed he was confident Glasgow would vote Yes in the referendum – in the same breath as insisting he would not use the Games as a campaigning pawn. Scroll down for video . First Minister Alex Salmond appears to have broken his promise not to use the Commonwealth Games to push his campaign for independence . Mr Salmond joined the Queen and Prince Philip to watch the spectacular opening ceremony . David Cameron also slipped pro-Union lines into his speech to the Commonwealth Games Business Conference, in which he praised ‘the UK – with Scotland at its heart’. And as Scotland’s biggest city welcomed competitors and spectators from around the world, the First Minister snidely toasted Chancellor George Osborne’s return to London. ‘I’m on this self-denying ordinance, so I’m trying not to get drawn into argy-bargy with George Osborne. He’ll go back to London and then we’ll all get on with enjoying ourselves at the Games,’ Mr Salmond told the Evening Times newspaper. ‘That’s what I intend to do over the next 10 days and I’m sure I speak for everybody in Glasgow and Scotland. What I would say is I’m confident Yes will win in Glasgow. ‘(The) latest poll indicated that swing last week and I’m confident we will win the city of Glasgow so I suppose you could call Glasgow Freedom city.’ His bravado came despite the most recent poll of polls showing a 14-point lead for the No campaign. The opening ceremony at Celtic Park was dominated by tartan and references to Scottish heritage and culture . In one of the more bizarre moments, giant Tunnock's Tea Cakes were seen dancing around the arena . The polls have also shown that Scots are desperate for a hiatus from the frequently bitter independence debate while the Games is on – but the First Minister - who tried to coin the term ‘Scolympians’ to refer to Scottish competitors in the GB team at London 2012 - could not help himself. He said: ‘I think Sir Harry Burns put his finger on it. The Chief Medical Office, recently retired believes the key to success in facing the deep-seated health problems of this city and this country because it’s not specific to Glasgow, is the sense of empowerment that independence will bring. ‘He thinks it will change people’s lives for the better, not just the country and the economy, but people’s lives and that was a very powerful message from Scotland’s most respected physician. ‘Also practical things, we won’t have bedroom taxes and oppression of the poor which is what happens from Westminster at present so we won’t have regressive policies that bear down on the poor, led by people like George Osborne. ‘The amount of money he has taken out of this city is huge.’ Prime Minister David Cameron and wife Samantha were seen chatting with Mr Salmond during a reception at the opening of the Games . During his visit, Mr Osborne pledged £24million to health technology, the arts and business in Glasgow, promising to turn the city into a ‘global powerhouse’. Earlier this month, the UK Government promised Glasgow would receive a £500million windfall – which was then matched by the Scottish Government – for major infrastructure projects, which will help create 15,000 construction jobs and 28,000 permanent jobs once work is over. At the business conference, the Prime Minister also stressed the importance of London to Edinburgh’s financial district. ‘One of the UK’s greatest strengths is financial services. It’s a Scottish strength, too, supporting 200,000 jobs here,’ he said. ‘And there is an inextricable link between the success of the City of London and the globally renowned financial centres of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow.’ Mr Cameron used a speech in Glasgow to insisted he wanted Scotland to remain in the UK . Political opponents urged Mr Salmond to leave the point-scoring to the athletes while the Games is on. Willie Rennie MSP, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader said: ‘This is desperate stuff from Alex Salmond who is now reverting to type as a chest-beating Braveheart cheerleader. ‘This is tired old rhetoric from a desperate politician trying to shore up support. The people of Glasgow have heard it all before. ‘It was free by 93, free by 2003, but none of it happens. He should focus on giving the answers to people’s questions and cut the cheesy movie lines.’ Patricia Ferguson MSP, Scottish Labour’s culture and sport spokeswoman, added: ‘These comments are offensive and misleading. Glasgow is already a free city and certainly doesn’t need Alex Salmond to liberate it. ‘At a time when Glasgow is pulling together to put on the Commonwealth Games, the First Minister should not be playing politics. ‘The Commonwealth Games are in Glasgow because politicians of all parties worked together but Alex Salmond seems to have broken his own promise to stop campaigning during the events on day one.’ He was also accused of complacency in claiming victory in the host city. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ‘Alex Salmond should not take the voters of Glasgow for granted. ‘He hailed victory in the city before the results of the 2012 council elections were officially announced and lost, and will be defeated again in September.’ Justine and Ed Miliband were at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games last night, but today she will be campaigning against Scottish independence on her own . A Better Together spokesman added: ‘Alex Salmond not talking about his obsession for 10 days? He can’t even manage 10 seconds. ‘We have been debating the referendum for over two years. It surely can’t be beyond even Alex Salmond to take a step back and let Glasgow’s Games take centre stage.’ Meanwhile, Justine Miliband is to hit the campaign trail without husband Ed today in a move which will dramatically raise her profile. The environmental lawyer will climb aboard Labour’s battlebus in Glasgow to urge voters to reject Scottish independence. In an unusual development, Mr Miliband will not join be by her side, in what will be seen as a trial run for his wife to play a central role in next year’s general election campaign. A Labour source said: ‘She is up in Scotland and wanted to take part in a bit of Better Together campaigning. Like lots of people in Labour, she feels strongly that the UK should stick together. 'It is a big question on the future of our country and she wants to take part in the campaign.","First Minister had promised not to use the Games to score political points .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Nasa’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite was getting ready to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California today at 10:56am BST (05.56 EST). But the launch was cancelled, despite Nasa saying there was a zero per cent chance of failure, when a water flow problem was discovered. The next launch window for OCO-2, which will be the first dedicated Nasa mission to monitor atmospheric carbon dioxide on global scales, could be as early as tomorrow. Scroll down for video . This long exposure photo shows the United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite onboard, at the Space Launch Complex Two, of the Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The launch took place at 10:56am BST today . The satellite had to be launched at exactly the right time to ensure it entered the right orbit. The issue was with the pulse suppression water system. This protects the launch mount holding the rocket from the high temperatures of a launch. And it helps protect from the shockwave of ignition from the engine. The water flow would have begun at T-minus 45 seconds. But when it was found not to be working properly, the launch had to be cancelled for safety reasons. The soonest next launch could be tomorrow in what is known as a '24 hour recycle'. This will bring it in line with a series of other Earth-observing satellites known as the ‘A-train’. In fact, the orbit is so precise that there is only a 30 second launch window within which it can take off; any delays and Nasa will have to try again another day. That is the reason why today's launch was cancelled, as the problem delayed the rocket lifting off by more than 30 seconds. Launch cancellations of this sort are not uncommon though. Rockets are a very dangerous business, so great care must be taken before attempting a launch and a host of safety checks must be met. Even the most minor of faults can lead to a cancellation; after all, Nasa and other agencies would rather delay a launch by a day or two than lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. Just a week ago, for example, private company SpaceX delayed the launch of its own Falcon 9 rocket when an issue was discovered that threatened the success of the flight. OCO-2 (illustration shown) is Nasa's first mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide, the leading human-produced greenhouse gas driving changes in Earth's climate according to Nasa. It will collect 24 measurements every second, totaling about a million every day . Nasa . Launch Manager Tim Dunn of the agency's Launch Services Program had . previously told the launch team this morning that the countdown and . conditions 'look very, very good'. Lift-off (zero seconds): Three solid rocket motors are ignited. 100 seconds after launch: The solid rocket motors are jettisoned as the rocket climbs to space. Four minutes: Main engine is cut off. Four minutes and eight seconds: Rocket splits in two as the stages separate. Five minutes: Nose cone opens up. 10 minutes: Second engine cuts out (Seco-1). 11 minutes: The satellite coasts in space for 40 minutes. 51 minutes: A second engine fires to place the satellite into the right orbit. 56 minutes: Final rocket engine separates from the satellite. 45 days: First science observations of carbon dioxide levels on Earth begin. When the launch does take place, OCO-2 will be carried into space by the United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket. It is the second of five Nasa Earth . science missions to be launched this year. Nasa monitors Earth's vital . signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and . airborne and ground-based observation campaigns. OCO-2 . is Nasa’s first mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon . dioxide, the leading human-produced greenhouse gas driving changes in . Earth’s climate according to Nasa. It will collect 24 measurements every second, totaling about a million every day. Of these, about 100,000 are expected to be sufficiently cloud free to provide highly usable carbon dioxide data. The . best carbon dioxide-observing satellite currently in orbit takes 4 . seconds to make one such observation and collects fewer than 20,000 . pieces of data per day, with about 500 of those being highly useful. OCO-2 studies carbon dioxide by looking at the colors (or wavelengths) of sunlight that carbon dioxide absorbs. To identify very small changes in this absorption from one wavelength to the next, the OCO-2 instrument separates light into many narrow bands of wavelengths. But OCO-2's field of view is only about one . square mile (three square kilometers) - smaller than New York City's . Central Park. This allows it to dodge clouds, which regularly cover . about two-thirds of Earth; even a tiny wisp of cloud in OCO-2's view . compromises the measurement. Six to seven weeks after launch, OCO-2 will be maneuvered into its final operational orbit in the A-Train constellation, 438 miles (705 kilometers) above Earth. And the first science observations of carbon dioxide levels on our planet are slated to begin about 45 days after launch. Technicians are seen making last minute preparations before the launch of the rocket. Nasa had said there was zero chance of the launch being cancelled today. OCO-2 will be able to pinpoint where the planet's forests and ocean are reabsorbing atmospheric carbon, a cycle that is key to Earth's temperature . Pictured here is Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The upper levels of the launch gantry can be seen, surrounding the United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite onboard, at the Space Launch Complex 2 on 29 June 2014 . 'Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a critical role in our planet's . energy balance and is a key factor in understanding how our climate is . changing,' said Michael Freilich, director of Nasa’s Earth Science . Division in Washington. 'With the OCO-2 mission, Nasa will be . contributing an important new source of global observations to the . scientific challenge of better understanding our Earth and its future.' Michael Gunson, OCO-2 project scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California, added: 'Knowing what parts of Earth are helping remove carbon from our atmosphere will help us understand whether they will keep doing so in the future. 'Understanding the processes controlling carbon dioxide in our atmosphere will help us predict how fast it will build up in the future. 'Data from this mission will help scientists reduce uncertainties in forecasts of how much carbon dioxide will be in the atmosphere and improve the accuracy of global climate change predictions.' The United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite onboard sits at the launch pad at the Vandenberg Air Force Base. About five minutes after launch the nose cone, pictured, will open up, unleashing the satellite into space and allowing it to enter its final orbit . Dave Crisp, OCO-2 science team leader at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), left, and Annmarie Eldering, OCO-2 deputy project scientist, also at JPL, are seen during a science briefing on 29 June 2014 ahead of the launch of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite . The spacecraft will sample the global geographic distribution of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide and allow scientists to study their changes over time more completely than can be done with any existing data. Since 2009, Earth scientists have been preparing for OCO-2 by taking advantage of observations from the Japanese Gosat satellite. OCO-2 replaces a nearly identical Nasa spacecraft lost because of a rocket launch mishap in February 2009. That was when the original Orbiting Carbon Observatory failed to separate during ascent, and subsequently re-entered the atmosphere, crashing into the Indian Ocean near Antarctica. At approximately 400 parts per million, atmospheric carbon dioxide is now at its highest level in at least the past 800,000 years, according to Nasa. The burning of fossil fuels and other human activities are currently adding nearly 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year, producing an unprecedented buildup in this greenhouse gas. OCO-2 measurements will be combined with data from ground stations, aircraft and other satellites to help answer questions about the processes that regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide and its role in Earth’s climate and carbon cycle. Mission data will also help assess the usefulness of space-based measurements of carbon dioxide for monitoring emissions.

I don’t think people see that side. If you don’t make . the weight you don’t fight. I’m not going to say how much weight I had . to lose but it was a lot, most people would have cried. ‘I . did a lot of exercise before breakfast that sped my metabolism up. My . carbohydrate intake was almost zero and all I was eating was six tiny . saucers of food every day, drinking lots of water then starting the . dehydration process. It wouldn’t normally have been so drastic.’ Williams, . a sport coaching student at Anglia Ruskin University, was a late . replacement for his injured team-mate Ben Fletcher. He defeated New . Zealand judoka Adrian Leat by one Waza-ari score. ‘It . feels incredible,’ he said, ‘I think the medal is just a bonus, the . crowd were phenomenal. It could have been in England the way the crowd . got behind me.’ Champion: England's Williams beat New Zealand's Adrian Leat in the under-73kg final in Glasgow . Confession: Williams says 'I'm not going to say how much weight I had to lose but it was a lot' Williams . greeted victory by ripping open his Gi (the jacket-like outfits worn by . the judokas) to reveal his heavily-tattooed chest. Asked if he planned . any more celebratory tattoos, he replied: ‘They’re all planned so . there’s no more room.’ After . the biggest victory of his career, Williams said he planned to . celebrate with a ‘can of Fosters or maybe some Guinness’. He also paid . tribute to his coach Luke Preston, who also coaches gold medallist . Ashley McKenzie. ‘Luke brought me through,’ said Williams, ‘and I’m not . the easiest person to deal with.’ There was also gold for Megan Fletcher who beat six-time Oceania champion Moira de Villiers of New Zealand. And . there was a bronze for Katie Yeats-Brown, who until a few days ago, . planned to be at a local bowling alley last night. In fact she spent the . early part of last night beating Canada’s Beatrice Valois to win a . bronze medal. She said: ‘I got the call on Tuesday morning at seven. I . was quite annoyed because my mum said I could have a lie-in, then shook . me awake and asked if I would like to fight at the Games. I thought my . mum had lost the plot because selection was a couple of months ago. ‘But it was OK once I found out and obviously I’d choose a medal over Laser Quest.’ Bronze: Katie Yeats-Brown (in the blue) came third and said she got the call up at 7am on Tuesday .","Danny Williams wins Commonwealth Games gold against Adrian Leat .

"By . Allan Hall . Corinna Schumacher is selling the private jet her husband Michael used to fly around the world in for £12million. The sale - 207 days since his life changed forever in a ski accident in the French Alps - is seen as proof that, whatever the outcome of his rehabilitation may be, he will never be the globetrotter he once was. Schumacher, 45, lies mute and immobile in a Lausanne clinic in Switzerland with long years of therapy ahead of him as he struggles to get back some of his old life that was shattered when he smashed his head on to rocks on December 29 last year. Scroll down for video . Corinna Schumacher is selling the private jet her husband Michael used to fly around the world in for £12million . Corinna Schumacher is offering her husband's grey Falcon 2000EX private jet, which is capable of flying at 920 km/h, for sale. Michael Schumacher is pictured arriving in Cannes in 2012 . Corinna is now offering his grey Falcon 2000EX private jet, capable of carrying eight passengers and flying at 920km/h, for sale. It still has Schumacher's initials on the tailplane. Germany's Bild newspaper commented: 'The reasons for the sale are obvious: during his active time as a Formula One driver, Schumi jetted between 300 and 400 hours annually with the aircraft around the world. 'Even in his break of three years (2007-2009), he used the Jet for many family vacations with Corinna and the children Mick, 15, and Gina Maria, 17. 'But now everything is different. The world of the Schumachers has changed.' It was reported at the weekend that Schumacher is continuing to make good progress in the Lausanne clinic following his re-emergence from a medically induced coma last month. Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick reported: 'There are signs that Michael will leave the clinic soon and be cared for at home.' It was reported at the weekend that Schumacher (pictured with Corinna in 2006) is continuing to make good progress in the Lausanne clinic following his re-emergence from a medically induced coma last month . Four months ago it was reported that his devoted wife Corinna and his family had invested heavily in transforming parts of their mansion home in Gland into a medical centre for him, complete with state of the art machines and a seperate building for carers to live in. The newspaper reported that a new building with no outside steps has been constructed on the grounds of the mansion. It is thought that this will be used as the long-term care home for Schumacher. Some experts say that such home-care for a coma patient is unwise. But with an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. Michael Schumacher was transferred to the University Hospital Lausanne, in Switzerland, on June 16 to begin rehabilitation . Four months ago it was reported that his devoted wife Corinna and his family had invested heavily in transforming parts of their mansion home in Gland into a medical centre for him . This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts. Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month following the accident in the French Alps in December. It is understood that he remains paralysed and communicates with his wife and children Gina-Maria, 17, and son Mick, 15, by fluttering his eyes. Doctors at the Lausanne clinic hope to have Michael sitting upright in an advanced electronic wheelchair that he can control via his mouth within a few weeks.

"By . Ian Drury . Police in Manchester admit the city centre is now ‘too dangerous’ after midnight because of the mayhem caused by Labour’s 24-hour drinking laws. Public safety can no longer be guaranteed because of rocketing alcohol-fuelled violence, said a senior officer. Inspector Ian Hanson said continental-style licensing since 2005 had led to chaos ‘spiralling out of control’. Offenders are now being allowed off the hook because there are too many violent incidents and too few officers because of budget cuts, he said. Unsafe: Continental-style licensing laws implemented in 2005 had led to chaos 'spiralling out of control' in places like the aptly named Shambles Square in central Manchester . He spoke out as a drunken thug was jailed for savagely stamping on a scientist in an unprovoked attack in Manchester city centre in December last year. Dr Dominic Henry, 32, had started a conversation with strangers Alan Croydon and Arron Buckley as he waited to get a cab home but was suddenly punched to the ground before being kicked up to 15 times as he lay defenceless. Labour talked of bringing a peaceful 'café culture' to the UK when it introduced round-the-clock opening in late 2005. But many towns and cities are now blighted by booze-fuelled thuggish behaviour with trouble ranges from fighting and drug dealing to pick pocketing and street robbery. Insp Hanson, 47, said he would no longer go into central Manchester late at night when the weekend drinking culture is in full swing at the city’s 300 pubs, bars and nightclubs. Chaos: Offenders are now being allowed off the hook because there are too many violent alcohol-related incidents in the city centre, said Manchester police's Ian Hanson . He said: ‘I would not be there past midnight now. I do not believe it is safe there. The situation is at crisis point - we cannot guarantee anyone’s safety after midnight.’ ‘We have got the fastest-growing night-time economy outside London with a new bar opening every weekend. There are a quarter of a million people coming into the city centre to enjoy themselves every weekend. ‘But at four o’clock in the morning we will have just half a dozen police officers on duty in the city centre, or even as few as four officers, which is beyond belief. ‘Cops are getting called to nightclubs to break up fights at 6am on a Sunday morning. The situation is spiralling out of control. Sooner or later something horrific is going to happen.’ Insp Hanson, who is chairman of the local Police Federation, said the force was so stretched in the early hours they let violent yobs walk free rather than take officers off the street to process the crimes. No problem: Labour councillor Pat Karney said he does not understand police critique of the drinking in Manchester . He said: ‘Officers have to take a pragmatic view about offences of disorder. ‘I am told regularly by colleagues that public order offences are not being acted upon because there are so few officers on duty and making an arrest would take them off the street for hours.’ The problem was worsened by cuts to police budgets and rank-and-file officers, he said. Dr Henry, a senior metallurgist with a chemical firm, had been out socialising with friends at the city’s Malmaison Hotel and a bar in the city's trendy Northern Quarter district before he the unprovoked attack. In a statement to Manchester Crown Court he said: ‘I was talking to them for a few minutes before they started punching. The attack was brutal, violent, beyond the scope of my imagination. I was an innocent, hardworking man that didn't deserve what I got.’ Croydon, 25, from Manchester, was jailed for 12 months after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm. A warrant was issued for Buckley, 25, who has gone on the run. The Mail has repeatedly highlighted the full scale of the misery and loutish behaviour inflicted on the public by Tony Blair’s government’s 24-hour drinking laws. Home Office figures show the number of town centres and neighbourhoods officially classed as being overrun by problem pubs and bars has rocketed by 150 per cent – from 71 in March 2007 to 175 last year. The situation in these areas is considered so bad councils have special powers to turn down planning applications for yet more bars to protect the public from further disorder. It has also led to a massive increase in so-called cumulative impact zones – the official term for an area ravaged by alcohol-fuelled mayhem. The Association of Chief Police Officers wants to be able to put drunks in holding cells where they will be charged up to £400 a night. Since round-the-clock drinking was brought in, police officers have dished out an estimated 400,000 fines for drunk and disorderly behaviour. Ministers have given councils new powers to limit the harm of excessive drinking but they have stopped short of returning to the traditional closing time of 11pm or midnight. But Councillor Pat Karney, Manchester’s city centre spokesman, said: ‘As somebody who lives in the city and is regularly out after midnight, it’s not dangerous. If the police have problems with any licensed premises they can come to the town hall and ask for it to be reviewed.’","Manchester police warns the city centre is not safe after midnight .

"By . Paul Bracchi . Almost every morning, Rolf Harris turned up at court arm-in-arm with his family. But behind the show of unity, his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi knew, better than anyone, that his near-saintly public image bore little resemblance to the real Rolf Harris. Devoted husband? He had an affair with his live-in housekeeper-cum-chauffeur back in the Nineties, which had left Alwen ‘devastated’, it emerged during the trial. Scroll down for video . Proud: Rold Harris pictured with his wife Alwn and daughter Bindi at Buckingham Palace in 1969 . Loving father? We now know he abused his daughter’s best friend from the age of 13 in the late Seventies and early Eighties. Harris had told Bindi that the ‘relationship’ started when the girl was 18, not 13. When she went into the witness stand to give evidence for him, Bindi told the court she believed him. But what daughter would want to believe their own father was guilty not just of adultery with her best friend, but of something much worse as well? So Bindi - and her mother - stood by him. From the very start, though, the daily show of ‘family unity’ looked suspiciously choreographed. Under cross examination, the jury learnt that the limousine bringing Harris and his wife to court stopped en route at a local cafe each day to pick up Bindi, so they could all arrive together. It was all for the benefit of the assembled TV crews and photographers. Proof, maybe, that the camera does sometimes lie. Harris’s . complex relationship with his wife and daughter, and their sometimes . unconventional behaviour, was the sub-plot to the case. Alwen, 82, a . sculptress and jewellery-maker in her heyday, sat in the public gallery . with other members of the family, just yards from her husband. She had to listen as his reputation - and, by implication, their 56-year marriage - was dismantled allegation by allegation. Deceived: Rolf Harris pictured with his daughter Bindi . After one especially harrowing day of evidence, she allowed him to step straight from the dock and kiss her on the lips. Only once did Alwen show any visible sign of emotion. When the jury was told about Harris’s fling with the housekeeper, Alwen appeared to wipe away a tear. Her eccentric streak was apparent from the first day, when she brought a novelty cushion (featuring the face of a gerbil-like creature wearing a crown) to sit on. It was as if to say she was the same Alwen who, in her younger days, chose her pet poodle to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. Bindi Nicholls — as she is now — was only allowed to take her place sitting near her mother in court once she had testified (her mother did not give evidence). During his summing up, the judge reminded the jury of the testimony of Mrs Nicholls’ childhood friend by referring to the victim’s statement:  ‘He hugged and tickled me. It was creepy’ … ‘He walked his fingers up my back’ … ‘His hand went inside the towel’ … ‘He spat on his fingers’ [before indecently assaulting the girl]. From 50-year-old Mrs Nicholls, herself an artist, there was not the slightest reaction; not a shake of the head nor the hint of an anguished expression. Nothing. She looked like a disinterested spectator, constantly fiddling with her mobile phone on her lap. Indeed, there were times during the trial when Mrs Nicholls appeared to be trying too hard to act normally. Quirky bride: Rolf harris and his wife Alwen - with her pet poodle as 'bridesmaid' - are pictured in March 1958 . Once, she wore a bright red flower in her hair; on another occasion, an almost fluorescent yellow scarf with black polka dots. Before she gave evidence, she could often be found in the canteen with her headphones on. During breaks in the proceedings, Rolf Harris became a ‘father’ and ‘husband’ again, joining his wife, daughter, other relatives and his agent in the waiting room outside Court Two, or in the canteen. At least two private security guards hovered in the background. Alwen and Bindi have always shunned the limelight, so the past few weeks must have been particularly painful. In one way or another, though, they have been victims of Harris’s stardom all their lives. Her husband’s non-stop work schedule left Alwen desperately lonely, particularly during the early years of their marriage, prompting her to confide in her diary: ‘I feel like killing myself, I’m so bored.’ In his 2001 autobiography, Harris says he only discovered how unhappy she was when, many years later, he found her old diary. ‘I had been so absorbed in my own career … that I had totally forgotten about Alwen. I am crying inside now as I write this.’ He recalled how he’d boarded a plane to go on a tour of the U.S. within a few hours of Bindi’s birth: ‘Right up until the last minute, Alwen expected me to cancel,’ he admitted. Rolf Harris leaves Southwark Crown Court, with his wife Alwen, left, and daughter Bindi, right . We now know that his failings went much deeper than merely putting his career first. Even so, his celebrity and long absences had a devastating effect on his daughter. In a rare interview more than a decade ago, Mrs Nicholls spoke about being desperately lonely as a child when her father was away. ‘I would be sitting on people’s doorsteps saying: “Can I play with you?” and, until recently, had never even displayed a picture of him in the house because of the inevitable reaction from visitors. ‘The conversation would go straight to my father and I’d think: “Oh, no, not again.”’ Mrs Nicholls, who has an 18-year-old son from a previous relationship, now lives in north London with her husband, Craig Nicholls. When she gave evidence, she said she was still having counselling to deal with the legacy of her relationship with her father. ‘It is really difficult having to be the daughter of a famous man, having to be the single child and dealing with that all on your own,’ she said. She said she had come to terms with his ‘affair’ with her best friend after finding out about it from the girl herself in 1997. But that was when she — and her mother — thought the relationship began when her friend was a young woman, not still a child.","Shows of family unity outside court looked 'suspiciously choreographed'

"By . John Lloyd . The most worrying thing about Andy Murray’s exit is the fact it suggested a regression in the mental side of his game to the pre-Ivan Lendl days. He lost meekly and there was no fighting spirit. It was a 1/10 performance from a mental point of view — the sort of display that you would never conceive of from a great player like he is. Andy had the demeanour of a first-round loser rather than a defending champion and he deserves to be criticised for his poor attitude. He was grumbling right from the start of the match and giving all the wrong signals to his opponent Grigor Dimitrov, who himself was nervous and there for the taking at times. Anger: Andy Murray was out of sorts against Grigor Dimitrov and seemed to lose his head . Control: Murray (left) must get back the grasp of his emotions he had under Ivan Lendl (right) Support team: Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo (right) and Dani Vallverdu at Wimbledon . Fallout: Murray's quarter-final exit at Wimbledon has led to him having to re-assess his team . I don’t know why Andy was shouting ‘f****** five minutes before the match,’ up at his box but that is the sort of negative thing he cut out under Lendl and it’s creeping back in again. I don’t think he’ll end his partnership with Amelie Mauresmo immediately and she deserves some time but it hasn’t been an immediate success. There were concerning signs from the start. Andy said he’d appointed her because she was a ‘good listener’. Well I’ve got news for him – it’s you who should be doing the listening, not the other way round. Amelie is a Grand Slam winner and was tactically very good throughout her career but Andy needs someone who will set standards and enforce rules, not simply someone to lend an ear. After the match he said he was going to go away and work on certain aspects of his game but I think he was playing the best tennis of his life in the opening three rounds - there didn’t seem to be any problems with his form. It is 90 per cent mental with Andy and that’s the area he needs to address because if he doesn’t get back to how he was in the Lendl days he won’t win another Slam. Error: Mauresmo looks glum on Centre Court as Murray crashes out in the quarter-finals . Pushing himself? Or maybe, the disastrous performance was all down to Murray himself? Lendl cut out his main weakness, which was the mental side, and him not being in his corner this time round was a big negative. I don’t think dropping down to 10 in the world is a big crisis for Andy but he does need to get back on the right track quickly. If Amelie doesn’t stay around I think he still needs a Grand Slam winner as his coach, someone who has been as good, if not better, than he is. He might look towards someone like Mats Wilander, Jimmy Connors or even John McEnroe, if they would do the job and commit to the travelling. His assistant coach and hitting partner Dani Vallverdu has been a big part of his success over the years. They first met at a Barcelona tennis academy and he has been by Murray’s side almost constantly for the last four years. But in football the assistant manager usually wants to move up and be the boss eventually. Dani might be getting frustrated about being told ‘you’re doing a good job but I need someone extra, a big name to be the main coach’. That’s possibly a source of friction. Experience: Murray could look to a former Grand Slam champion like Mats Wilander (pictured) as a coach . Kyle Edmund is our top young prospect in the men’s game and we’ve got a lot riding on him. He’s 320 in the world but is still only 19. The question is whether his coach Greg Rusedski has the credentials to take him to the next level. I’m not sure how many days Greg is contracted to work with Kyle but at this stage in his career he needs someone there all the time and I’m not sure having a part-time coach is the best idea. Greg plays a lot of seniors matches, does TV work and makes a lot of corporate appearances so I’m not sure he’s in the position where Kyle is his priority week in, week out. Kyle has the potential to be a top player but what you don’t want to see is him regressing because he doesn’t have the right team around him. Potential: Kyle Edmund is the top British prospect and Greg Rusedski could be great for him . Roger Federer is a great story - to be one game away from being an eight-time Wimbledon champion is absolutely mind-boggling. He loves the game more than anyone and that has been clear this fortnight. The fact that he is still at the top of his game as a father of four is credit to the team he has around him, particularly his wife Mirka. Everything is very regimented with Roger as I understand - every part of his life, from training to eating to spending time with his kids, is mapped out with military precision . Often parents on tour feel torn because their family stay at home while they travel but Roger’s family go everywhere with him so he doesn’t have that dilemma. I heard that he and his wife have never spent a night apart since they married and she is definitely his rock. The crowd are likely to be heavily behind Roger but I think Novak Djokovic will be holding the winner’s trophy - he might just get too many balls back into play to counteract Roger’s serve. Incredible: Roger Federer is one win away from a record eighth Wimbledon title . Regimented: Federer and his wife, Mirka (pictured), have his life mapped out to the minute .","Lendl had helped Murray to cut out petulance from his game .

"By . Vanessa Allen . A buy-to-let tycoon has banned housing benefit tenants in favour of Eastern European migrants who he says are more likely to pay their rent on time. Fergus Wilson has sent eviction notices to 200 tenants on housing benefit and said he would not accept any more welfare applicants. The former maths teacher, who built up one of Britain’s biggest buy-to-let empires with his wife Judith, said his decision was based on experience as he had found Eastern Europeans were less likely to default on rent payments than Britons on housing benefit. Fergus Wilson has sent eviction notices to 200 tenants on housing benefit and said he would not accept any more welfare applicants. The former maths teacher built up one of Britain's biggest buy-to-let empires with his wife Judith . He said many other private landlords had taken the same decision, a claim echoed by housing charities including Shelter. It warned ‘benefit blackspots’ were forming across Britain as claimants have been forced to move out of popular areas. Private landlords have the right to refuse or accept tenants, and recent evidence suggests they do not want those who rely on housing benefit. Research from the National Landlords Association in December revealed that the number of private landlords letting to people on benefits had dropped to just one in five. Mr Wilson, 65, said housing benefit rates had gone down in recent years, while private rent had gone up. ‘The gap is such that I have taken the decision to withdraw from taking tenants on housing benefit,’ he told The Guardian. ‘From what I can gather just about all other landlords have done the same. Our situation is that not one of our working tenants is in arrears – all those in arrears are on housing benefit.’ Mr Wilson said the housing shortage in the South East meant there was strong competition for rental properties, and he now preferred tenants from countries like Poland, who were more likely to pay their rent on time. He said private landlords run their properties as a business and have to make decisions based on economic factors. Mr Wilson said his decision was based on experience as he had found Eastern Europeans were less likely to default on rent payments than Britons on housing benefit. He said many other private landlords had taken the same decision, a claim echoed by housing charities including Shelter . ‘Tenants on benefits are competing with Eastern Europeans who came to the UK in 2005 and have built up a good enough credit record to rent privately,’ Mr Wilson said. ‘We’ve found them to be a good category of tenant who don’t default on the rent. With tenants on benefits the number of defaulters outnumbers the ones who pay on time. ‘Single mothers on benefits have been displaced to the bottom of the pile; sympathy for this group is disappearing. There aren’t enough places for people to live.’ Mr Wilson and his wife, also a former maths teacher, started their property empire in 1986. They were said to have been on the brink of financial ruin in 2008 after banks stopped lending in the credit crunch, but were saved when the Bank of England slashed interest rates and held them at a historic low. They now own nearly 1,000 properties around Ashford in Kent and their property empire has been valued at an estimated £225million. Around nine million people pay rent to a private landlord. Shelter said some 500,000 claim housing benefit. Its spokesman Roger Harding said the refusal of some private landlords to accept welfare claimants as tenants meant they were forced to leave desirable locations and accept poor quality housing.

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Mark Duell . Andy Coulson told the phone hacking trial yesterday that his affair with Rebekah Brooks was ‘wrong’ and ‘shouldn’t have happened’. Speaking for the first time about the on-off relationship, the former newspaper editor said he felt responsible for the pain it had caused his wife Eloise Patrick. Coulson arrived at the Old Bailey hand-in-hand with his wife, and the mother of three watched from the public gallery as he gave his evidence, while Brooks looked on impassively from the dock. Evidence: Former Editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson and his wife Eloise arrive at the Old Bailey . The affair between Coulson and Brooks was revealed by the prosecution last year amid claims that it lasted for six years. The . jury has already heard Brooks, 45, admit the ‘dysfunctional’ fling. She . wrote an emotional love letter to Coulson in 2004 in which she . described him as her ‘very best friend’ and told him: ‘I love you.’ Outside court: Coulson followed Rebekah Brooks (pictured) as editor of the now-defunct Sunday tabloid between 2003 and 2007 . Coulson, . 46, who later became Prime Minister David Cameron’s director of . communications, spoke of his regret over the affair, which began in . 1998. He told the court: ‘There was an affair that started in 1998 and . ended quite soon after, but it did restart, as the court has heard. ‘It . was not by any means continual. There were very long periods – very . long periods – where the relationship was what it should have been, a . good friendship. 'I don’t want to minimise it or excuse it. It was wrong . and it shouldn’t have happened and I take my full share of . responsibility for the pain it caused other people, not least my wife.’ Coulson . admitted that the affair meant he shared confidences with Brooks, who . later became editor of the Sun while he was editor of the News of the . World. But he denied the intimacy meant they had breached ‘professional standards or rules’. The . prosecution claim the relationship went on while the pair were at the . centre of an alleged conspiracy to hack phones at the News of the World . between 2000 and 2006. Both . deny the plot and Coulson said he had never heard of private detective . Glenn Mulcaire – who has admitted phone hacking for the tabloid – until . Mulcaire and royal editor Clive Goodman were arrested in 2006. He . said he had thought the newspaper’s £105,000-a-year contract with . Mulcaire’s company was for legitimate surveillance and research and told . the court the figure was not ‘massive’ in the Sunday newspaper’s . £32million annual budget. After . becoming editor in 2003, he spent £22,000 on ‘flowers and alcohol’ as . gifts for staff and contacts. When asked about the £105,000 contract, he . said: ‘I don’t want to be dismissive but the reality is that it’s not a . lot of money in the business. On trial: Both Brooks (left) and Coulson (right) are accused of conspiring to hack phones and separate charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office . Together: Rebekah Wade and Charlie Brooks (centre) with Andy Coulson (right) and his wife Eloise (left) ‘We . paid double that to the astrologer (Mystic Meg).’ Coulson said Mulcaire . was already on the News of the World payroll when he took over as . editor from Brooks, saying he ‘inherited’ the investigator. He . described an atmosphere of intrigue and secrecy at the now defunct . Sunday tabloid and said he had been shocked by the ‘destructive’ rivalry . between different departments, particularly news and features. Coulson, . of Charing, Kent, praised Brooks as a ‘supportive’ editor and said they . had both wanted to change the ‘counter-productive’ competitive . atmosphere at the newspaper. Coulson . resigned as editor in January 2007 after Goodman and Mulcaire were . jailed for phone hacking, and he was appointed as the director of . communications and planning for the Conservative Party in July that . year. After the 2010 . election, Coulson became Mr Cameron’s director of communications, . overseeing a team of civil servants in Downing Street, but resigned in . January 2011 amid growing speculation that he could face arrest as part . of the phone hacking investigation. Coulson today said he had had ‘sparing’ contact with former boss Rupert Murdoch since his resignation. And . of his contact with Mr Cameron, he said: ‘My family and I spent a . weekend with him in the spring after I left. I have not spoken to him . since.’ He added that the invitation came before he left his Downing Street job. Coulson and Brooks both deny conspiring to hack phones or commit misconduct by paying public officials for information. Brooks . and her husband Charlie, who married in 2009, also deny conspiring to . pervert the course of justice. She was previously married to EastEnders . actor Ross Kemp in 2002 and has admitted her affair with Coulson . happened before and during that marriage. All seven defendants in the trial, including Goodman, 56, deny all the charges against them. The trial continues. Prime Minister: Jurors heard Coulson spent a weekend with David Cameron (pictured) after he resigned as his media adviser amid controversy over what he knew about phone hacking while he was editor of the NotW . Movement: Coulson resigned as NotW editor in 2007, after the conviction of former royal editor Clive Goodman (pictured) for hacking, and joined Mr Cameron's team . The engagement of David Beckham to ‘Posh Spice’ Victoria Adams proved to be ‘a happy event all round’ when they made a deal over the story, the hacking trial has heard. Andy Coulson said he counted the couple as good contacts during his time as showbiz editor at the Sun. He said they were ‘very effective in building a business with the media’. He told the court about the story of their engagement. Pop group: The Spice Girls turned up at Coulson's house when they were looking to promote their first record, the phone-hacking trial was told . Coulson said: ‘It was a deal with them. From memory, I cannot remember exactly. This is the day they were getting engaged. We were the only paper to get the interview. ‘We were the only paper to get the close-up on the ring. We then sold the pictures on and we made a deal for syndication.’ Judge Mr Justice Saunders commented: ‘A happy event all round.’ Coulson agreed, to laughs in the courtroom. The witness went on to say the rise of the Spice Girls roughly coincided with his career. Ring: The engagement of David Beckham to 'Posh Spice' Victoria Adams proved to be 'a happy event all round' when they made a deal over the story, the hacking trial heard . He said: ‘They were looking to promote their career. ‘They were looking to promote their first record. As, at the time, I did not make it to the office in the morning, they were so keen to build a relationship with the Sun they turned up at my house. ‘The Spice Girls was as much a marketing story as a pop story.

"By . Becky Barrow . Using a first-class stamp to send a letter is a waste of time most of the time, a postal economist has warned. They are extremely useful for last-minute birthday cards, but most people should not ‘bother’ using them with other mail because so few letters are time sensitive nowadays. Ian Senior, an independent expert, also said Royal Mail’s crucial ‘universal service obligation’ will not survive for another five years. Economist Ian Senior said people should not ‘bother’ using first-class stamps because so few letters are time sensitive nowadays. He also said Royal Mail’s ‘universal service obligation’ will not survive another five years . At present, the postal giant must deliver letters to Britain’s 29 million addresses six days a week for the same price whether it is going to the Scottish highlands or the Cornish coast. A first class stamp, which costs 62p, means it must be delivered on the next working day. A second class stamp, which costs 53p, must arrive within three working days. Royal Mail is legally obliged to achieve this target for first class post 93 per cent of the time, although this rule is scrapped at Christmas time every year due to the huge increase in post. Mr Senior added: For your birthday cards, that [a first class stamp] is fine. But, for everything else, don’t bother. ‘Anybody who buys a first-class stamp in a book of stamps is doing it for birthday cards they have to send and for no other reason.’ When Royal Mail boss Moya Greene was asked recently about the last letter she had posted, she said it was a 17th birthday card to her niece who lives in Canada. There is very little mail left that is so time sensitive that it must arrive overnight because email and other forms of electronic communication have usurped the need for speed, he said. Mr Senior said: ‘Who cares if your letters comes one day later or two days later? ‘It really does not matter in virtually every case.’ He said the claim of ‘the cheque is in the post’ is ‘long out of the window’, with most people simply transferring money online, rather than posting a cheque. Many businesses do not bother with overnight postal deliveries either. The banking giant Lloyds, for example, uses a service which takes between three and five working days. Asked yesterday on Radio 4’s Today programme if the universal service is on its way out, he said: ‘Most certainly’. Mr Senior said the idea of delivering letters to every single address in the country six times a week ‘within five years’ will be seen as absurd, although the universal service is heavily protected by law. He added: ‘The big revolution is that letters as we know them are falling through the floor.’ In 2006, Royal Mail was handling around 80million letters and parcels every day, compared to just 58million a day today. At Royal Mail’s first annual general meeting yesterday [thurs] since its privatisation last October, one shareholder asked why it bothers with two different classes of stamps. Donald Brydon, the chairman, said: ‘It gives our customers choice and I believe putting our customers first is the best way to run a business.’ A Royal Mail spokesman added: ‘Ofcom’s most recent review of postal users’ needs identified that one of the core user requirements is a range of services that enables customers to choose the most appropriate product or service for their needs. ‘Customers have the right to choice, and the evidence shows they welcome this aspect of the universal service provided by Royal Mail.’ Shareholders were also concerned the pay gap between postmen and directors, a continued pledge not to make political donations and wanted reassurance about its commitment to stamp collectors. Of the army of around 500,000 shareholders in Royal Mail, the company said 156 attended yesterday’s AGM held at the vast NEC in Birmingham. Last night, Royal Mail’s shares, which were priced at £3.30 each when the company floated on the stock market, closed at £4.47.","Expert Ian Senior says people should not 'bother' using first-class stamps .

"By . Hugo Gye . and Vanessa Allen . Tony Blair sent Rebekah Brooks a series of text messages signed off with kisses at the height of the phone hacking scandal, it was revealed yesterday. The former prime minister repeatedly offered the beleaguered newspaper executive help as she prepared to face questions from MPs in the days before she was arrested. The messages he sent from the Middle East, where he was acting as a peace envoy, were revealed to the phone hacking trial as the former Sun and News of the World editor gave evidence about the days leading up to her arrest. Advice: Rebekah Brooks received a string of supportive text messages from Tony Blair . Friendship: The former Prime Minister signed off his messages with the letter 'x' The jury has heard that Mr Blair . offered himself as an ‘unofficial adviser’ to Brooks, 45, and Rupert . Murdoch in an hour-long phone call in which he told her: ‘It will pass. Tough up.’ Mr Blair also texted Brooks on the day of the . tabloid’s final edition in July 2011 – and the last text message was . sent just a day before Brooks was arrested. The first message came on July 10, . 2011, the day the News of the World was shut down, with Mr Blair trying to arrange a . meeting with Brooks to give her advice. At 8.30pm, he wrote: 'Hi it's Tony, I've just landed. Is it too late to speak or should we stick with tomorrow.' Brooks, 45, replied twelve minutes later to say: 'Let's stick to tomorrow', adding in a further message: 'Can't wait xx'. The following day, Mr Blair texted at 10.48am to asked: 'What's the best number for you? I'm ready to speak.' Brooks replied at 1.31pm: 'Sorry. Only just escaped meetings. When is a good time? X . He replied at 1.55pm: Now. Call my hotel landline.' He gave the number and told her: 'Ask for room 610.' In a further message, he wrote: 'I'm in the Mid East. Call me when you can. T x' His advice . was given in the days after the News of the World was forced to close . because of public anger over the illegal hacking of murdered schoolgirl . Milly Dowler’s phone. Couple: Brooks and her husband Charlie arriving at the Old Bailey this morning for the phone hacking trial . Leaving: Brooks outside court after her 13th day giving evidence in the trial . The security guard accused of helping Rebekah Brooks hide evidence from police has fractured his skull. Mark Hanna was absent from the Old Bailey today after sustaining an injury in an accident. His . lawyer, William Clegg QC, told the court: 'Mr Hanna is absent today . again. He met with an accident over the weekend and last night was . diagnosed with a hairline fracture of his skull. 'He has been directed to have bed rest before he is reviewed by doctors again. We hope he will be back with us next week.' Hanna, . the head of security at News International, is accused of helping . Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie remove incriminating documents . and computer evidence from their home. He . was also a key part of Operation BlackHawk, the security team charged . with protecting Brooks at the height of the phone hacking scandal. The next message was from Mr Blair on . July 15 - the day Brooks resigned from her job - saying: 'I'm really . sorry about it all. Call me if you need to. T x.' The following day, he told her: 'If you're still going to Parliament you should call me. I have experience of these things! T x' The . revelations about Mr Blair’s behind-the-scenes contact with Brooks . could be embarrassing for Labour, which has sought to distance itself . from accusations it was too close to the Murdoch empire. After . 13 days of evidence, prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said she had enjoyed a . ‘meteoric rise’ at News International and had been in control of her . alleged co-conspirators, either as their boss or through marriage. He . suggested her success was based on her relentless pursuit of stories . for her newspapers without caring if they were sourced through hacking . or corrupt payments. In a . dramatic conclusion to five days of cross-examination, he said: ‘You . were running your world and not much happened in it which you didn’t . want to happen when you were at the top of the tree.’ He went on to say: . ‘Your evidence has been a carefully presented and prepared script that . bears little relation to the truth.’ Brooks . denies conspiring to hack phones, commit misconduct and pervert the . course of justice. All seven of the defendants in the trial, including . her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks, deny all the charges . against them. The trial continues. Help: Brooks planned to ask Lord Mandelson for coaching before her appearance at Parliament . Rebekah Brooks wanted to seek advice from Peter Mandelson on how to survive being interrogated by MPs over the phone hacking scandal, a court heard today. The Labour grandee was due to be asked to meet the News International chief at a farmhouse in Oxfordshire when she was called to appear before the Culture, Media and Sport select committee. However, the training session was abandoned when Brooks was forced to resign in the wake of revelations about hacking at the News of the World, and was subsequently arrested. The hacking trial at the Old Bailey has previously heard that Tony Blair offered advice and support to Brooks at the height of the scandal in July 2011. Giving evidence for a 13th day, she told the jury that Lord Mandelson, the former Business Secretary, had agreed to coach her before her select committee appearance, and she had wanted him to come to a friend's house, Enstone Manor Farm. 'We were all going to have a full debrief for the select committee and we were going to have a preparation session', she said. 'I was very inexperienced at dealing with televised select committees.' Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: 'You were going to have a mock session so you could practice, and you wanted to ask Mr Mandelson to see if he will come and help?' Venue: Brooks was planning to spend the weekend at Enstone Manor Farm, pictured . Brooks replied: 'Lord Mandelson had set up a PR company, like an advice company.' Mr . Edis said: 'There was going to be coaching for your appearance on TV, . because it would be broadcast as select committee proceedings sometimes . are. Did that happen at Enstone Manor?' But Brooks replied: 'We didn't do any of the TV prep because things changed on the Friday.' She . was hoping to spend July 16 and 17 with Lord Mandelson ahead of the . select committee hearing on July 19, but cancelled the session after she . resigned on Friday July 15, the court heard.

"By . Hugo Duncan . Britain will be the best performing major economy in the developed world this year and will grow at nearly twice the pace of the US, a global financial watchdog declared last night. The International Monetary Fund said it now expects output in the UK to rise by 3.2 per cent in 2014 – leaving rival economies such as the US, Germany and France trailing in its wake. The IMF said Britain had delivered one of the few ‘upside surprises’ so far this year and warned that the global outlook has deteriorated. Scroll down for video . The International Monetary Fund now expects the British economy to grow by 3.2 per cent this year, faster than every major economy . It said ‘increased geopolitical risks’ – both in Ukraine and the Middle East – ‘could lead to sharply higher oil prices’ as it slashed its forecasts for Russia. Ministers said Britain is now ‘in the fast lane of recovery’ following the deepest slump in post-war history when the economy crashed by 7.2 per cent under Labour. Official figures published today look set to show that the UK is now producing more than it was before the recession struck – bringing the longest downturn on record to an end. Analysts expect the Office for National Statistics to say gross domestic product increased by around 0.8 per cent between April and June – taking it past the pre-recession peak. Paul Hollingsworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said it ‘would mark another milestone for the recovery’. The latest forecasts from the IMF are another victory for George Osborne, who only 15 months ago was accused by its chief economist of ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity. The Fund has since admitted it was ‘too pessimistic’ about the UK – and upgraded its forecasts for 2014 four times in the last nine months. It is a major boost for Chancellor George Osborne who was last year warned by the IMF that he was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with spending cuts . This time last year it was predicting annual growth of only 1.5 per cent – less than half of what it now expects – and as recently as April pencilled in 2.9 per cent. The latest upgrade was the largest positive revision for any country in the G7 – which also includes the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy – and the BRIC economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The Chancellor said: ‘The IMF has upgraded their 2014 forecast for the UK by more than any other major economy. ‘The Government’s long-term economic plan is working. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future.’ David Cameron said ‘more growth means more jobs and more security for families’. The IMF cut its global growth forecast for this year from 3.7 per cent to 3.4 per cent and warned of ‘downside risks’ – including in Russia and the Middle East. The US economy is expected to grow by 1.7 per cent this year, down from the 2.8 per cent expected in April, while the outlook for the eurozone was unchanged at 1.1 per cent. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it has taken two years longer than planned for the economy to return to pre-crash levels . IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said: ‘The recovery in the euro area remains weak and inflation is too low.’ Germany’s economy is now expected to grow by 1.9 per cent this year, up from the 1.7 per cent expected in April. But the IMF cut its forecast for France from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent. Russia’s fragile economy is expected to all but grind to a halt this year as the crisis in Ukraine takes its toll. The IMF said the Russian economy will grow by only 0.2 per cent this year following expansion of 3.4 per cent in 2012 and 1.3 per cent last year. It also slashed its growth forecast for next year to only 1 per cent. Ruth Porter, head of economics and social policy at the Policy Exchange think-tank, said: ‘The IMF is eating humble pie again. ‘Britain’s economic plan to get the public finances in order has helped raise business confidence and assisted in restoring growth to the economy. ‘Beating other major economies, these figures are a real coup for the Chancellor.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said that despite the recovery ‘most people are worse off’ and face ‘a lost decade for living standards’. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Pay packets are still falling behind rising prices, so most people are not yet sharing in the recovery. If the good news on growth is going to last, real wages must start improving too.’","International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of 3.2% in 2014, 2.7% in 2015 .

"By . Chris Stocks . It is no wonder Jos Buttler admits he is surprised at how quickly his Test call-up has come, given it is less than two months since captain Alastair Cook said the wicketkeeper wasn’t ready for the step up. Cook’s verdict came after Buttler’s record-breaking century during the fourth One-Day International against Sri Lanka at Lord’s in late May. Buttler had hit 121 off 74 balls as England came agonisingly close to chasing down 301. VIDEO Scroll down for Buttler deserves his chance . Coming in: Jos Buttler has been called in to replace the injured Matt Prior . Ins and outs: Buttler is set to take Prior's place behind the wicket for the third Test . VIDEO Buttler deserves his chance . Jos Buttler, 23, has been talked about as the new Adam Gilchrist and he does have an incredible one-day record but his four-dayrecord — with Somerset and new countyLancashire — is less impressive . One-dayers: In 94 one-day games for club andcountry, Buttler has hit three centuries with asuperb average of 49.12 and a sensational strike rate of 124.25 . Twenty20: In his T20 career, he has arespectable average of 26.24 after 119 games,with an astonishing strike rate of 143.63. He has smashed 10 fifties . First-class: In 56 four-day games, he hasmanaged just four centuries at an average ofIT IS no wonder Jos Buttler 33.32, with his strike rate plummeting to 59.17 . His hundred, the fastest by an England batsman in 50-over cricket, sparked comparisons with Australia’s great wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist. The 23-year-old’s century came off just 61 balls, beating the record of 69 set by Kevin Pietersen in 2004. Buttler will now be expected to provide some of the X-factor which has been missing from England’s batting since Pietersen was sacked in February. A move from Somerset to Lancashire last winter has paved the way for the keeper’s elevation. It is no surprise Peter Moores has called on Buttler now, given it was his decision to bring him to Old Trafford before swapping being coach of Lancashire for the England job. ‘It is a dream come true,’ said Buttler on Tuesday. ‘It’s probably come sooner than I imagined. I still feel I’ve got improvements to make, but it’s great I’ve been named in the squad. I can’t wait to get started. ‘It was a really tough decision to leave Somerset, but with my long-term goal being Test cricket, I knew I had to leave. 'I guess it’s justified it and it’s justified it pretty quickly. I didn’t expect to be playing Test cricket this quickly, but in sport opportunities come in different ways and at different times and I’m delighted.’ Scrutiny: The duo of Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores have really struggled so far this summer . Impact: Buttler's performances in limited overs internationals have been incredibly impressive . Buttler needs only to look at Matt Prior, the man he replaces in the team, for a warning that his keeping will now be under the microscope. Prior’s unreliability with the gloves saw him dropped early in his England career. It is one of the reasons he has departed now, with his body unable to withstand the rigours of keeping at the highest  level. By all accounts, Buttler’s glovework, which was shaky at the World T20 in Bangladesh in March, has improved at Lancashire this summer. It is with the bat, though, that he excites.

"By . Mike Dawes . London Welsh have boosted their chances of survival in the Aviva Premiership next season with the signing of former New Zealand scrum-half Piri Weepu. Weepu, who joins from Super 15 side the Blues, represents something of a coup for Welsh, who secured promotion from the Championship in May. The 30-year-old won the World Cup with the Kiwis in 2011 and earned 71 caps for his country, scoring 103 points along the way. New club: Former New Zealand scrum-half Piri Weepu has joined London Welsh . Weepu said: 'I'm hugely excited by the opportunity of joining London Welsh and at the challenge of playing in the Aviva Premiership - consistently one of the best leagues in world rugby. 'London Welsh is an iconic and globally recognised brand in the rugby world and I'm looking forward to linking up with head coach Justin Burnell and my new London Welsh team-mates - and helping the club re-establish itself in the top flight and in Oxford.' Weepu joined the Blues for the 2012 Super 15 campaign, after eight seasons with the Hurricanes. At provincial level he played for Auckland and Wellington, as well as representing New Zealand Maori and the All Blacks at Under-21 level. He made his senior New Zealand debut in 2004 against Wales at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, with his last appearance coming against France in June 2013. The experienced number nine played an important role in the Kiwis' 2011 triumph, particularly in their knockout victories over Australia and Argentina, when he was named man of the match. Experienced: Weepu won the World Cup with the All Blacks in 2011 and has earned 71 caps . Welsh head coach Justin Burnell said: 'It doesn't get much better than being a World Cup winner with 71 caps for the All Blacks - it's a signing that speaks for itself. 'It's massive statement of intent from the club in regard to its drive to be able to compete in the Aviva Premiership next season - and not just survive. 'It's also going to be a fantastic opportunity for the younger players within our squad to mix and learn from a player of Piri's experience and ability. As a player, his skill set is unbelievable; his kicking game and tactical appreciation are tremendous. Ready for action: London Welsh coach Justin Burnell poses with the Aviva Premiership trophy last week . 'After meeting with him in Singapore at the club 10s, his personality and aura is such that it will be second nature for him to fit in to the environment we've created at London Welsh.' Weepu will join up with his new club at the end of the current Super 15 campaign.

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . Alastair Cook has accused India of ‘making a mountain out of a molehill’ over the altercation between Jimmy Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja in Nottingham in an attempt to nobble his star bowler and destabilise England’s efforts to beat India. Anderson could face a four-match ban after being hit with a 'Level Three' charge by the ICC after India complained that he had shoved Jadeja in the Trent Bridge pavilion on the second day of the first Test. England have responded by bringing a Level 2 charge against Jadeja for his part in the contretemps, leaving Cook to accuse the Indians of doing their best to get Anderson out of the team. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alastair Cook's reaction to James Anderson disciplinary saga . I know what they're doing! Alastair Cook thinks India's pursuit of James Anderson is all mind games . Alleged altercation: James Anderson and Ravi Jadeja exchanged words at Trent Bridge . Heated: James Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja exchange words during the first Test at Trent Bridge . Article 2.3.3 of ICC's Code of Conduct . 'Where the facts of the alleged incident are not adequately or clearly covered by any of the above offences, conduct that either: (a) is contrary to the spirit of the game; or (b) brings the game into disrepute'.

Two suspension points equates to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended player.

I think that’s . pretty much where it’s come from.’ Cook . was unable to talk in detail about the incident, which remains under . cricket’s equivalent of sub judice while the ICC consider the charges . brought by England. But he did make it clear the dressing-room’s . surprise that the incident has escalated to this extent. ‘We’re . surprised it’s come to the situation it’s come to,’ he said. ‘But we . can’t let it be a distraction to us. For Jimmy, all the lads can rally . around him – he’s a stalwart of our side, an outstanding bowler with a . fantastic record. ‘It’s . probably a tactic a little bit from India if we’re being honest, and we . just can rally around him. Hopefully he can get this ball swinging at . certain times in this Test match and Jimmy can let his cricket do the . talking.’ Would the Indians’ reporting of Anderson make him even more determined to end England’s winless streak of nine Tests? Cook . replied: ‘Hopefully, yeah – for me as a captain that would be great. As . a side we don’t need any more motivation because we haven’t won for a . while.

"By . Liz Hull . A mother of 12 abandoned her children leaving her husband to care for them single-handedly after running off with a toyboy lover. Peter Saunders, 47, became a single father to his dozen offspring – whose ages range from 22 years down to just 19 months – when his wife, Tabitha, 39, moved 260 miles away to set up home with a security guard. Last night Mr Saunders branded his ex-wife ‘despicable’ for putting her boyfriend, Colt Nimes, 32, who she has since married, before her family. Peter Saunders at home with all 12 of his children whose ages range from 22 years down to just 19 months . Unemployed Mr Saunders – who has not worked for more than a decade and receives £2,000 in benefits each month – said: ‘I don’t think the kids will ever forget what she’s done. ‘It’s despicable. Walking out on the whole family and leaving me to do it all on my own. 'It is hard with 12 of them running around and sometimes I wonder what on earth I’m doing, but I couldn’t be without them. I love them all to bits. ‘How a mum can do that to her kids is beyond me.’ Mr Saunders met his wife around 20 years ago when their parents were neighbours. By the time the couple married in 1996, Mrs Nimes already had a son, Matthew, now 22, by another man and had given birth to their first daughter, Rhiannon, 18. They went on to have another ten children – Ben, 16, Jack, 14, Josh, 13, Adam, 12, Blake, ten, Rhys, nine, Lillie, seven, Peter Jnr, six, Aston, three, and Beth, 19 months. Left holding the baby: Peter Saunders pictured with his ex-wife Tabitha with and youngest child Beth . However, in March last year – when her youngest was just 12 weeks old – Mrs Nimes left the couple’s terraced home, in Rhyl, North Wales, to live with Mr Nimes in Southampton. Mr Saunders, a convicted drug dealer, discovered his wife had been cheating on him after finding text messages on her phone. She had met Mr Nimes when they worked as security guards at the London 2012 Olympics. Initially, Mrs Nimes took the two youngest children – Beth and Aston – with her, but they were returned to their father after she failed to attend a court hearing. She now sees the children ‘every five or six weeks’ but Mr Saunders maintains that they hardly miss their mother. ‘She never showed them any affection, so we’re probably better off [without her],’ he said. ‘I don’t think the kids will ever forget what she’s done' Peter Saunders, 47, father-of-12 . ‘My feelings for her have never changed. I don’t think she’s a bad mother – she just can’t cope, she’s got mental problems, post-natal depression and all that and needs help. ‘She has never stopped sleeping with me even though she’s with him, she comes back every five or six weeks to see the kids, but it’s only the youngest ones that really miss her.’ Mr Saunders, a former painter and decorator originally from Roehampton, south London, is currently wearing an electronic tag and must obey a night-time curfew after he and Matthew pleaded guilty to dealing cannabis earlier this month. Police discovered two boxes of cannabis – one among Christmas presents – which contained 43g of the drug, valued at about £450, in a raid last December. Mr Saunders claimed that he  only smoked the drug to help relieve pain in his feet caused by diabetes. But messages found on his stepson’s mobile phone revealed that people were contacting him via his Facebook profile to attempt to buy the drug. Judge Rhys Rowlands spared Mr Saunders and his stepson prison after hearing that the children would end up in care if they were jailed. Instead they were handed 12-month sentences, suspended for two years. Mr Saunders, who drives a Jaguar, added: ‘I can’t save any money – it’s always used one way or another. ‘It’s hard financially but I get quite a bit in benefits and I am a good shopper. I only ever buy in bulk when there are offers on.’ Last night Mrs Nimes could not be contacted, but she told the Sun: ‘This is about my ex-husband so I’ve got nothing to say. P*** off.’","Peter Saunders, 47, has become a single father to his dozen offspring .

"By . Associated Press . Psychiatric patient Richard Plotts (pictured) opened fire at the hospital . A psychiatric patient had dozens of bullets on hand when he killed his caseworker and intended to kill more people at a suburban Philadelphia hospital complex on Thursday afternoon, authorities say . Richard Plotts, 49, had a problem with the hospital's ban on guns, although it's not clear if that was the direct motive for the shooting, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said. Psychiatrist Lee Silverman told police he fired back at Plotts with his own weapon after Plotts opened fire at an office adjacent to Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby. Whelan says Silverman routinely carried a gun and had no specific fear of the suspect. Authorities . say Plotts is sedated but in stable condition after surgery from his . gunshot wounds. They expect to charge him with murder at his bedside . once he awakes. Police say . Plotts has a lengthy history of gun arrests, violence and mental health . problems. They say he had 39 bullets on him after the shooting. The . psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Silverman, was grazed in the temple during the . gunfight in his office Thursday afternoon with patient Plotts. 'There were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' Whelan said. The slain caseworker, 53-year-old . Theresa Hunt of Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to the psychiatric . crisis center at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby, just southwest of . the city, authorities said. An officer walks near the scene of the shooting on Thursday, July 24, 2014, at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby, Philadelphia . 'When the caseworker was shot, (Silverman) crouched down behind the desk to avoid him being shot,' Whelan said. 'He . was able to reach for his weapon, and realizing it was a life or death . situation, was able to engage the defendant in the exchange of gunfire.' The . struggle spilled out into the hallway, where another doctor and . caseworker jumped in to help Silverman and secure Plotts' weapon, Whelan . said. Police in Upper Darby . were aware of at least three mental health commitments involving Plotts . — once after he cut his wrists and once when he threatened suicide — . but said such stays can last just one to three days. Plotts also had at least four gun arrests, along with assault and drug charges, according to police and court records. A hospital worker views police activity near the scene of a shooting at a wellness center attached to Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital . Lock down: Police arrive at the hospital after reports of a shooting . And he has been barred from at least . one residential shelter because of his violent history, Upper Darby . police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said Friday. 'The . case workers and the doctors and the catchment centers — they know who . violent individuals are, because they're frequent fliers. And the system . is not geared toward keeping these people housed somewhere until they . start to be better. So you put whole communities at risk,' Chitwood . said. Plotts may have been . angry with Silverman over his treatment plan, Whelan said. Colleagues . heard arguing during the appointment and saw Plotts aiming a gun at . Silverman when they peaked inside the door. They quietly backed out and . called 911. The shooting soon began, just before 2:30 p.m. However, Whelan did not know if Silverman was carrying a gun because of a specific fear of Plotts. The . psychiatrist was recuperating at home Friday. His wife said he did not . want to discuss the shooting, and she also declined to comment. An officer stands guard near the scene of the shooting on Thursday . Evidence: Crime scene workers arrive at the hospital on Thursday afternoon . Plotts does not have a listed home number, and it was unclear if he has relatives in the area. Hospital . policy bars anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from . carrying weapons on campus, a Mercy Health System spokeswoman said. She . otherwise declined to discuss the reports that Silverman was armed at . work. 'We remain focused on . working with the Delaware County Police Departments to understand fully . the details of the event,' said the spokeswoman, Bernice Ho. Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.' 'Without . that firearm, this guy (the patient) could have went out in the hallway . and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the . chief said. Both guns were . recovered from the scene. The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third . floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community . teaching hospital. There . are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area . outside, and no metal detectors at the entrance, authorities said. Cathy . Nickel, a neighbor at Plotts' last known address, an apartment complex . in Upper Darby, saw a caseworker move him out of the building about a . year ago.

It’s part of our DNA. 'The second part of what he likes is giving youth a chance. He’s got a track record littered with giving young players a break in the first team, who have gone on to be stars. 'Clearly that’s Manchester United’s philosophy and we want him to continue with that. 'I’ve personally found him very warm. He’s a very clear communicator and very direct.

"By . John Drayton . Tiger Woods believes he should be at this year's Ryder Cup - but accepts he may have to do more to convince United States captain Tom Watson. Former world number one Woods is on the comeback trail after a three-month lay-off following a back operation. Woods' appearance at the Open at Hoylake this week was just his second since undergoing surgery in March. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tiger Woods on injury, his form and desire to make Ryder Cup . Frustrating: Woods was expected to perform better at the Open despite recently returning from an injury lay-off . Disappointing: Woods would have hoped to have performed a lot better at the Open . Dejected: Woods strolls off the 18th green looking disappointed at the end of his final round . After playing all four rounds at Royal Liverpool, Woods appears to have proved his fitness but his form is a different matter. The 14-time major winner had mixed fortunes on the Merseyside links, finishing six over after a three-under-par first-round 69. Having fallen well down the standings for automatic Gleneagles selection during his absence, he may be relying on being named as one of Watson's wildcard picks for the September match. Asked if he should be selected, Woods said: 'I would say yes, but that's my position, my take on it. ""He's the captain, obviously it's his decision. He's going to field the best 12 players that he thinks will win the cup back, and I hope I'm on that team.' Woods has been a wildcard pick before, in 2010 when Corey Pavin added him to his side for the competition at Celtic Manor. The 38-year-old said: 'I got picked by Corey back in whenever it was when we played in Wales. 'I was coming off an injury as well there with my Achilles, and I sat out for most of the summer. Thinking: Woods eyes up a putt during the final round of the Open championship . Improvement: Woods holds up the ball after putting out on the 13th green . 'I felt like I was able to contribute to the team and that's all you want as a pick, you want someone who can contribute to the team, whether it's in support or it's in play. 'I did it then and hopefully I can actually earn my way on to this team.' Woods is confident he can do that in the most convincing fashion with outstanding performances in the coming weeks at the Bridgestone Invitational - which he won last year - and the US PGA Championship at Valhalla. He added: 'Well, I'd like to win the next two tournaments I'm in. That should take care of that.' Woods' final round at Hoylake included a double-bogey six at the seventh hole and four other bogeys. Assessing his week on the Wirral, he commented: 'I got four rounds in, unfortunately I didn't play very well today. 'It was a little different on the first day, obviously, but I just made too many mistakes. I had two triples (bogeys), two doubles. Just way too many mistakes. 'But the fact I was able to play a few weeks ahead of time, and I'm only getting stronger and faster, is great.' Woods, a triple Open champion, finished five strokes behind 64-year-old five-time winner Watson, who closed with an impressive 68. Preparation: Woods gets ready for the 15th tee during the final round of the Open with his caddie Joe Lacava . Straight faced: Woods walks off after finishing his final round during day four of the Open Championship . Watson has said he will pick Woods for Gleneagles if form and fitness warrants it, but will make no guarantees if he fails to make the play-offs for the FedExCup. Watson had hoped to speak to Woods at some stage during their week at the Open but that has not occurred. 'I just said hello. We're going to talk on the phone,' said Watson. 'But it's a little bit early with Tiger to even talk to as far as where he is. Where it needs to be is higher up on the list. 'It looks like he's playing without pain but, again, he's not in the mix. 'He needed to get in the mix to get some points to get some money and get in the FedExCup. That's what I was hoping he was doing this week.' Phil Mickelson is another high-profile American player currently outside automatic selection. 'If Phil and Tiger don't make it in the mix there, I've got some real thinking to do. 'Everybody is thinking that I'm going to pick them automatically but I can assure you that I'm not going to pick them automatically.'","The 38-year-old ended six over par after a frustrating championship for him at Hoylake .

"By . Rebecca English . Beauty, they say, is in the eye of the beholder. But as the Duchess of Cambridge’s first official portrait was unveiled to the public yesterday, art critics were, unusually, largely united in their condemnation. ‘Ghastly ... rotten ... an out and out disaster,’ was the view of the editor of the British Art Journal, Robin Simon. Scroll down for video . The Duchess attended the gallery for the unveiling of the first official portrait of her painted by Paul Emsley . Real impact: The painting is much bigger than lifesize - which one art critic called a 'jolly brave' choice . One to show the grandchildren? The pregnant Duchess looked in high spirits as she arrived at the gallery for a private viewing this morning ahead of the public unveiling . Their muse: The Duchess introduces her husband to artist Paul Emsley after viewing his portrait at the National Portrait Gallery . ‘It’s only saving grace is that it’s not by Rolf Harris,’ was the best that David Lee, now editor of The Jackdaw and a former editor of Art Review, could manage. Kate, on her first official outing for almost a month, was far more polite. ‘It’s just amazing. Absolutely brilliant,’ she told the artist, Paul Emsley, when she met him at the National Portrait Gallery, where the picture will hang. Her husband, Prince William, nodded sagely. ‘It’s beautiful, it’s absolutely beautiful,’ he concurred. From others, however, the biggest criticism seemed to be the generally ageing nature of the portrait, which took three and a half months to produce. Most seemed to think it makes the duchess, who turned 31 this week, look at least 15 years older. Portrait of the artist: Emsley working on the painting at his studio in Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire, using a photo taken when the Duchess visited him there in May . What he saw: The artist said he wanted to emphasise Kate's 'sparkling green eyes' Then there are the shadows and creases . which give her a rather baggy-eyed look, not to mention the squareness . of her jaw and the rather coppery tint to her famously tumbling brunette . locks. One onlooker at the gallery yesterday . couldn’t get over what they described as her ‘grey, smoker’s skin’, . while another commented that her mouth appears to be set in a grimace . rather than the promised enigmatic smile. The glittering sapphire and diamond earrings Kate wears in her portrait were once owned by Princess Diana, who received them as a wedding present from Prince Charles. William’s mother was given the earrings by Charles because they bore a startling resemblance to her engagement ring – which is now also worn by the daughter-in-law she never got to meet. Diana famously wore the jewels on the cover of Vogue in July 1994, as well as on numerous other public occasions. After her death it is understood they were returned to Charles who gave them to his ‘darling daughter-in-law’ when she married William in 2011. Kate first wore them in public on her royal tour to Canada, after having them slightly remodelled. While the director of the National . Portrait Gallery, Sandy Nairne, declared himself delighted by such a . ‘captivating image’, most members of the public who trooped into Room 37 . after the unveiling took one look at the portrait before turning . excitedly to the half-naked video of sleeping footballer David Beckham . made by Sam Taylor-Wood, which was playing nearby. To be fair, royal portraiture has . always been a subjective issue. Rolf Harris, who was asked to paint the . Queen in 2005, admitted that in the early stages he made the monarch . look like a ‘pork butcher from Norwich’. Mr Emsley, who has garnered plaudits . for his wildlife paintings, has always divided critics with his . realistic, almost ‘photographic’ style of painting. Renowned critic Brian Sewell has . described it as ‘sickening’, but the artist has won several prestigious . awards including the 1997 BP Portrait Award. The National Portrait Gallery, of which . Kate is patron, drew up a shortlist of four painters but the duchess, . who graduated from St Andrews with a 2:1 in history of art and . previously studied at the British Institute in Florence, plumped for Mr . Emsley. She posed for the artist before she . became pregnant, having one sitting at his studio in Bradford-on-Avon, . Wiltshire, followed by another at Kensington Palace in London, in May . and June last year. He also worked from a series of photos he took of the duchess. The finished picture shows her in a . Windsor blue pussy-bow blouse imagined by the artist because she wore . different outfits for each of her sittings. Yesterday Kate, wearing a burgundy . dress from High Street store Whistles and displaying no sign of her . 12-week baby bump, brought along her parents, sister and brother for the . great unveiling. They spent around ten minutes looking . at the picture before attending a private breakfast reception, after . which the media were allowed in. Asked what the duchess thought of his . work, Mr Emsley said yesterday: ‘I think, from what I can see this . morning, she’s delighted with it. I’m very happy about that.’ He said Kate had personally chosen the . photo she wanted him to work from because of the way her hair fell, the . light on her face and her expression generally. But he admitted he had changed the . colour of the duchess’s eyes slightly on finished oil to match ‘the . background and the colour of her blouse’. He added: ‘What she wanted was that the portrait should convey her natural self as opposed to her official self. ‘The fact she is a beautiful woman is, . for an artist, difficult. When you have lines and  wrinkles it is much . easier as an artist to capture them as a  person. Obviously she has none . of that. ‘But I tried to do that with her smile and hope I have succeeded.’ The portrait, which is likely to have . cost upwards of £20,000, has been donated to the gallery by art . philanthropist Sir Hugh Legatt. The Duchess appeared to be showing the first signs of a baby bump as she was photographed outside the gallery . Kate arrives at the gallery with Prince William. The baby is likely to be moving about but its movements will be too small for Kate to feel them just yet . Did he get it right?

"By . David Kent . John Terry has taken on his son in a game of head tennis in the pool on holiday and, ever the competitor, beat him conclusively. The Chelsea defender uploaded the video to his Instagram page, which features him and his son heading the ball back and forth, before eventually his son succumbs to the pressure, leaving JT to come out victorious. It wasn't a bad showing at all from the youngster, though, who seems to possess his the same technique in the air as his dad. Back... ...and forth . And celebrate: John Terry celebrates the win with his son . Terry has been enjoying a summer off with his family, as England struggled without him at the World Cup following his international retirement. Calls for Terry's integration back into the England set-up were voiced after the Three Lions registered only a point during this summer's showpiece in Brazil. The centre-back retired from international duty in September 2012 after winning 78 caps and despite appeals for his reinstatement, Terry was omitted from Hodgson's World Cup squad, with the former club colleague Gary Cahill, Everton's Phil Jagielka and Manchester United duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling being taken as the quartet of centre-backs.","Terry uploads Instagram video of him playing head tennis with his son .

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . Monaco have ruled out signing former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes after he failed a medical with the French club on Wednesday. The Spain international left the Nou Camp last week, 12 years after making his debut for the Catalan giants, and had looked set for a move to Ligue 1. But the transfer was put in doubt towards the end of last season after the 32-year-old damaged his cruciate ligament during a routine win over Celta Vigo in March. It's all over: The goalkeeper ended a 19-year association with Barcelona at the end of last season . And at a press conference on Thursday, Monaco’s vice-president Vadim Vasilyev confirmed the move is off. ‘Victor Valdes is injured and won’t join us,’ he told reporters. Vasilyev went on to reiterate the club’s belief in the ability of current first-choice goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. ‘Danijel has all the qualities to keep his place next season. He had a very good season and the coach believes in him.’ Almost there: Victor Valdes was pictured with a Monaco supporter in the principality on Wednesday . Valdes had travelled to Monaco in a bid to prove his fitness on Wednesday, with one supporter of the principalilty club tweeting a picture with the Spaniard. Leonardo Jardim - appointed after the sacking of Claudio Ranieri - will lead Monaco into the Champions League next season. The former Sporting Lisbon coach abandoned plans to sign Valdes, despite the pre-contract agreement made between player and club in January. Monaco's decision will alert a number of clubs in Europe, who will no doubt consider a move for a goalkeeper that has played at the highest level with Barcelona for nearly a decade. He's out of there! Ranieri was sacked by Monaco despite achieving Champions League qualification .

"By . Laura Williamson . Male boxers at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow will not wear head guards for the first time since 1982, with experts claiming it is actually safer for the athletes’ health. Head guards have been used at all international amateur competitions since they were introduced before the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, but research has shown they actually increased the number of head injuries. Women’s boxing, however, which makes its Commonwealth Games debut in Glasgow, will continue to use head guards, as not enough research has been done in the relatively new sport for the same change to be made. Gone: Male boxers will not wear head guards at the Commonwealth Games for the first time in 32 years . Doctor Mike Loosemore of the English Institute of Sport (EIS) has worked with British Boxing since 1997 and believes the rule change is a ‘positive development’. He said: ‘Evidence has found that, when they introduced head guards in 1984, the number of head injuries increased. The number has actually decreased since head guards have been removed. ‘The style of boxing has changed a little bit because the boxers’ heads are not getting quite so close and I think it’s made it a bit more interesting to watch. It’s a positive development. ‘The boxing’s better without the head guards and it’s reducing the number of head injuries, which is low in this sport anyway.’ Dangerous: Experts says that head guards actually increase the risk of injury for amateur boxers . Dr Loosemore said the number of concussions are lower without a head guard primarily because boxers do not feel so confident and therefore take fewer risks with their bodies. He told Sportsmail: ‘When you have a head guard on you are more likely to get an injury. ‘There are several reasons for this: it could be that head guards restrict your vision slightly, so you don’t see the punches coming, and maybe that the head guard increases the size of the head so you get more rotational force (when you are hit). ‘The referees also can’t see the boxers so clearly, so they can’t see when they’re in trouble. ‘But the most likely reason is people just feel more confident with a head guard on. They don’t put their head in a position where it can’t get hit. That’s the most persuasive argument for me.’ The men will also fight under a pro-style 10-point scoring system as part of rule changes by the International Boxing Association (AIBA) last year.

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Ed Woodward insists Manchester United are ready and willing to break the British transfer record if new manager Louis van Gaal decides they need to do so. Woodward endured a frustrating first summer as United's executive vice-chairman last year, as mooted transfers for Cesc Fabregas, Thiago Alcantara, Gareth Bale and even Cristiano Ronaldo failed to materialise. United have paid upwards of £50million for Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, but as has been the case for the last few years, the biggest transfers have taken place away from Old Trafford this summer. New era: Ed Woodward says Manchester United will break the British transfer record if Louis Van Gaal pinpoints a player who the club needs to sign in order to compete at the highest level .

Fresh ideas: Louis van Gaal has an 'aura' about him and is the right man for United, says Ed Woodward . In the spotlight: Van Gaal is interviewed by MUTV as he prepares for his first game in charge of the club . Big money: Woodward says United would be willing to break the British transfer record of £50million which Chelsea spent to bring Fernando Torres to the club from Liverpool . Real Madrid signed James Rodriguez for £63million on Tuesday and Barcelona paid £75m for Luis Suarez earlier this month. When asked whether United would be willing to pay a similar amount for a player, Woodward said: 'It is in our capabilities. The club are not afraid of doing that - spending significant amounts of money in the transfer market.' Such a move would cause United to break the £50m record transfer fee paid by Chelsea for Fernando Torres in 2011. Woodward insists neither he nor the club would be fazed about being responsible for such a big deal. 'Whether it's a record or not doesn't really resonate with us,' Woodward said. 'What resonates is a top, top elite player that the manager wants that is going to be a star for Manchester United. 'We are in a very strong financial position. We can make big signings. Beaming: Luke Shaw completed his £31.5million move to United, something which Van Gaal okayed . Mistakes: Chief executive Woodward failed to sign Gareth Bale (left), Cesc Fabregas (centre) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) last summer . 'I get pointed in the direction of a target that the manager wants and there is an assessment of what that might cost and I'll negotiate hard to do the best I can on the trade.' United are believed to be interested in signing Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund, as well as Van Gaal's compatriots Daley Blind, Stefan de Vrij and Kevin Strootman. Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen is also on Van Gaal's wish list but is understood that Juventus' Arturo Vidal is not being considered as a potential signing. As well as experiencing troubles in the transfer market, Woodward also took the difficult decision to sack David Moyes, who was just 10 months into a six-year contract. Woodward admits it was the toughest call of his career. 'I can't think of any bigger (decision),' he said. 'It is certainly the most important role in the club by some distance and we didn't take the decision lightly. It was a difficult decision. 'It was a challenging year. In an ideal situation, I would have worked with (Sir) Alex (Ferguson) for a year. But now there is a lot more positivity.'

"By . Martyn Ziegler . Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella has admitted Lionel Messi was right to go public with his criticism of the coach's tactics. Messi was unhappy Sabella played with five defenders in their World Cup opener against Bosnia-Herzegovina - it was only at half-time, after the coach reverted to the usual 4-3-3 formation, that Argentina began to look impressive. Argentina face Iran in Belo Horizonte in their second Group F game and Sabella insisted that Messi had been right to speak out. Scroll down for videos... Outspoken! Lionel Messi has questioned Alejandro Sabella's tactics in their opening World Cup game . Sabella told a news conference: 'I was not hurt by Leo's comment and he has said that before. 'He likes to play 4-3-3 with (Angel) Di Maria up front. 'He was asked how he likes to play and he answered what he thinks in a respectful way. We respect each other, we have a very strong team spirit. It is good to have an open dialogue with my players. 'Sometimes players learn from us the coaches and sometimes we learn from them. 'We can all make mistakes you know. On Sunday we will start with a 4-3-3 formation and we will take it from there. We may have to change the formation or not.' It was only after the change against Bosnia that Argentina started playing fluently, culminating in an excellent individual goal by Messi, who said a 4-3-3 formation makes it much easier for him and fellow striker Sergio Aguero. Leo knows best! Lionel Messi prefers to play using a 4-3-3 formation, similar to that used by his club Barcelona .

'We as strikers favour that line-up. In the first half I was often on my own and so was Kun (Aguero) and it was very difficult, so there are things to be improved on.' Sabella said he had no issue with Messi going public over this concerns. 'I am the one who encouraged Messi to (say that) and I fully trust all my players from a human and professional standpoint,' he said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Missouri woman is facing multiple counts of child abuse after authorities say she left her 22-month-old daughter tied to her garage with a rope and allowed her home - which she shares with the toddler and another child - to become a feces-covered mold den. To top it all off, when authorities were investigate the disgusting home, they found a loaded rifle in the baby's crib. According to a probable cause statement obtained by MailOnline, 37-year-old Cheryl Darlene Dudley, of St. Peters, faces seven counts of endangering the welfare of a child and one count of child abuse for subjecting her children to the deplorable conditions. Authorities first caught wind of the conditions in Dudley's home on Monday, when a witness called police to report that the 22-month-old was seen tied to the garage. Tired: 37-year-old Cheryl Darlene Dudley said she left the loaded gun in the baby's crib because she was tired . When officers arrived at the home - located in the 1300 block of Cave Springs Estates - the toddler was no longer tied to the garage, but Dudley admitted that she'd used rope as a harness for the child and tied it to the garage to keep the child from going into the street. When officers entered the home, they found several prescription pills on a dresser in the baby's bedroom. Dudley told the officers that she didn't know what they were, but they'd been on the floor, so picked them up and put them on the dresser. She said she stole them from her mother and brother hoping they would help her get to sleep. Moving on from the prescription drugs, officers looked in the baby's crib and found the loaded rifle just sitting on top of the sheets. Dudley explained to the officers that she thought she heard someone in the backyard, so she grabbed the gun hoping she would scare off any possible intruders. Filthy: Authorities found feces, mud and mold throughout Dudley's Missouri home . When Dudley realized there was nobody in the yard, she left the rifle in the crib - she told police she was 'too tired' to put the gun in its proper place. After discovering the rifle, officers began to notice the filthy conditions of the home. In their report, the responding officers say there was dog feces all over the floor of the home, as well as mold, mud  and cigarette butts. The bathrooms, the officers note, were 'covered in dirt and filth,' and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. The officer noticed that the refrigerator in the home was operational, but smelled of rotten food. 'Harness': Police initially were called to Dudley's house because a witness say her 22-month-old baby tied to the garage . In the basement, officers found extensive water damage, as well as pieces of plastic and cloth laying at the base of a hot-water heater, which poses a potential fire hazard. The officers also noticed bruising on the toddler, which Dudley said was from 'disciplining.' The baby also had dog-scratches and flea bites on her legs. In addition to removing the children from the home, authorities also removed five dogs due to the disgusting conditions. Dudley was booked into jail on $30,000 cash only bail.","Police initially were called to Cheryl Darlene Dudley's house because a witness saw the baby tied up to the garage .

"By . Rebecca Camber . Updated: . 04:16 EST, 15 December 2011 . International investigation: Francisco Marco, head of the Metodo 3 agency, said his team followed leads worldwide . Scotland Yard detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are examining eight ‘important’ new leads, it was claimed yesterday. Spanish private investigators have handed over 30 boxes of documents which could yield a breakthrough. On Tuesday, four British officers visited the Barcelona HQ of Metodo 3, the detective agency employed to look for Madeleine by her parents Kate and Gerry for six months after she vanished at the age of three in 2007. The agency’s director, Francisco Marco, said there were ‘six, seven or eight very important leads’ within the files. But sources close to the British investigation played down the significance of the material yesterday. It is the second time that Metropolitan Police detectives have flown to Spain as part of their review of her disappearance. Last month they spent three days with the Spanish National Police and Civil Guard force as part of inquiries into whether she was abducted and smuggled across the border from Portugal. British detectives have also recently collected documents from the Portuguese police, Leicestershire police and the McCanns. Vanished without trace: Madeleine McCann disappeared from her bedroom in Praia de Luz, Portugal, in May 2007. Despite extensive efforts to find her, she remains missing . Still searching: Kate and Gerry McCann, at the launch of a book written by Kate, are not giving up hope . Yesterday Mr Marco said on Spanish TV: . ‘We have provided [British police] with all the documents and . information we have collated worldwide about Madeleine’s disappearance.’ He told The Ana Rosa Programme: ‘[The leads] were passed at the time to . Portuguese police who ignored them because it was a very politicised . issue.’ Madeleine, of Rothley in . Leicestershire, disappeared from her  parents’ holiday apartment in .

Her parents hired Metodo 3  to find her four months after she vanished. The agency sent a team to Morocco to follow leads that she might have been smuggled out of Portugal. Mr Marco said he still believed that was ‘very possibly’ what happened to her but refused to give more details.

"By . Nick Harris . What price a World Cup? The bottom line for FIFA is that Brazil 2014 will earn the world governing body at least £2.55billion. By the next tournament, in Russia in 2018, that will have jumped above £3bn to cap an extraordinary doubling in income between 2006 and 2018. As the new issue of specialist sports business journal Sportcal Insight details, TV income for this summer’s event alone will be about £1.5bn. Winner: FIFA President Sepp Blatter holds up the name of Russia as the 2018 World Cup host . German and Italian broadcasters are paying £163million each, the French around £122m, the BBC and ITV combined around £120m for UK rights, and US broadcasters £150m. That is set to soar in 2018 and beyond. The World Cup is uniquely popular, with roughly a third of the planet’s seven billion population expected to watch at least one of the 64 games on television. The final in Rio will be the most watched event of any kind in the world in 2014, and it is expected that the average global audience per match this summer will easily top 150m. Last time the average was 188m per match. Such an extraordinary reach means FIFA can attract some of the biggest brands in the world aspartners and sponsors. Adidas have paid £120m to be partners for the current four-year cycle up to Brazil 2014. Visa and Emirates are each paying £66.8m, Coca-Cola £75m, and Hyundai and Sony also spending tens of millions. McDonald’s, Budweiser and a raft of others are also paying to be associated with the beautiful game, meaning FIFA will earn £733m at least from commercial deals this summer. Excited: It seems the entire world has got in the Samba mood for Brazil 2014 with less than a week to go . 2.2 BILLION - number of people in the world (31 per cent of 7bn) who watched at least one World Cup match in 2010 on TV . 188.4 MILLION - the average live global TV audience per World Cup match. The World Cup is like 64 Super Bowls in a month, except every one is bigger . 530.9 MILLION - the live global TV audience for the 2010 World Cup final . 17.3 MILLION - the average viewers per match in Brazil for 2010 World Cup, rising to an average of 44m for Brazil games . 5.3 MILLION - average UK TV audience for 2010 World Cup . 17.9 MILLION - the highest audience for England vs Germany . Ticket sales, hospitality packages and merchandise will add another £315m. Where all this money goes is a different matter entirely. FIFA distribute much of it around the world to associations and development projects. Unquantifiable amounts go on expenses for FIFA executives. And more than a billion dollars is sitting in FIFA’s bank account. For more see this week’s Sportcal Insight magazine.

"By . Ryan Lipman . A 32-year-old woman who was raped and killed in Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens has been remembered as a 'beautiful friend and colleague'. Devastated colleagues who worked with pastry chef Renea Lau at a dessert bar in Melbourne's inner-east have told of their grief, The Age reported. Ms Lau is a Chinese national from Hong Kong and moved to Australia in 2012. Scroll down for video . The 32-year-old woman who was killed and sexually assault in a Melbourne park has been identified as Renea Lau - a Chinese national from Hong Kong . Her alleged killer, Scott Allen Miller, is to face expected to Victoria to face court in Melbourne today after being arrested on the NSW South Coast yesterday. He is expected to be charged with her rape and murder. Ms Lau's naked body was found under a tree by joggers in about 8.30am on Saturday. The 42-year-old man appeared at Batemans Bay Local Court on the New South Wales south coast on Tuesday morning - where Victorian detectives were successful in their application to extradite him, the ABC reported. This meant police were able to question him and possibly charge him over Ms Lau's death in the Southbank park. Ms Lau's colleagues spoke about their grief to The Age. Colleague Steven Kearney - who looked deeply affected by her death - said the 32-year-old was a 'wonderful person' and worked in the kitchen as part of the pastry team. Suspect Scott Allen Miller has been extradited to Victoria by police after appearing in court on Tuesday . 'I would just like to state with deep sadness that Renea was an employee,' Mr Kearney told The Age. 'She will be terribly missed here. She was...a beautiful friend and colleague. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.' Mr Kearney asked the media to respect his and his other colleagues' privacy as they were 'grieving and working through this difficult time' During Tuesday's court appearance, Miller was handcuffed and wore a green tracksuit, and answered two questions put to him by the magistrate. The homeless man was identified as the key suspect in the 'extremely violent' assault and murder, and was arrested on the NSW far-south coast on Monday after a national alert was issued by Victorian police. They had been searching for him since Saturday. He was arrested by an off-duty police officer near Eden, while camping in a small cove area and was later taken to a police station. Police are yet to officially identify Ms Lau as the alleged victim and some of her relatives in China have been contacted. Her family will arrive in Australia later this week to formally identify the 32-year-old's body. Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter confirmed on Monday that the woman had been sexually assaulted before she died. 'This is a particularly violent assault on this woman, she has been sexually assaulted and she has been physically assaulted,' Insp Potter said. Police have not confirmed the cause of death but said the woman died at the scene. It is believed she was on her way to work at 5.20am on Saturday when she was approached by Miller. Left: Scott Allen Miller was captured on CCTV footage at a shopping centre on Springvale Road in Glen Waverley at midday on Saturday. Right: The man (right of picture) who was seen on CCTV walking north along Swanston Street past the Melbourne Town Hall with 42-year-old Scott Allen Miller about 1.50am on Saturday assisted police with their investigations, but they stressed he was not a suspect . CCTV footage from the morning of the crime shows a woman being chased across St Kilda Road into the Botanic Gardens near the corner of St Kilda Road and Linlithgow Avenue. Miller had been sleeping rough in the rotunda at the botanic gardens, 200 metres from where the body was found. Miller was born in the U.S. and once lived in an affluent Perth suburb. In the 1990s, he was a leading figure in the illegal dance party scene in Perth as director of E-Nerve Pty Ltd a company that organised raves, The Age reported. On Monday afternoon, Homicide Squad detectives appealed for help to identify a second man who was seen out drinking with Miller on the night of the crime and may be able to assist with the investigation. Police confirmed on Monday evening that the man seen on CCTV footage walking along Swanston Street with Miller about 1.50am on Saturday had contacted police. He attended a city police station and made a statement on Monday evening, police say. Earlier on Monday, Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter urged the man to make contact with police or call Crime Stoppers. The woman's naked body was discovered in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Southbank . Her body was discovered by joggers on Saturday morning under a tree in the popular park . 'We do not believe this man was involved in the woman's death, but it's important we speak to him as he may be able to help with regard to Miller’s whereabouts,' Det Insp Potter said. Miller and the other male were seen entering a licensed premises on Bourke Street between Swanston and Russell streets around 2am, where it's believe they stayed for a number of hours before leaving separately. Detectives have been told that Miller was asked to leave the establishment around 5am. He is then seen on CCTV shortly after walking south along Swanston Street and across Princes Bridge. It is believed he approached the victim at 5.20am and chased her into the botanic gardens. Police say they have connected Miller to several items found at the crime scene. Miller, who is originally from Western Australia, has been sleeping on the streets of the city for at least six weeks and is known to police in other states, although he does not have a criminal history in Victoria. While police issued a national alert, they concentrated their search on the Melbourne area.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A young New Jersey mother shown in a cell phone video being pummeled by a former co-worker has spoken out for the first time since the vicious attack, saying she was shocked that no one besides her 2-year-old son came to her rescue. Catherine Ferreira, 27, appeared before reporters in her home in Salem, New Jersey, Friday with a badly swollen face and two black eyes. Ferreira suffered a broken nose and a mild concussion at the hands of Latia Harris, 25, who was captured on video throwing the petite woman to the ground like a rag doll and repeatedly punching her in the face. Scroll down for videos . Horryfing aftermath: Catherine Ferreira, 27, suffered a broken nose, two black eyes and a mild concussion, but she said she could have been dead had her assailant struck her in the right spot . Little hero: Ferreira said her sole protector during the beating was her 2-year-old son, Xzavion, who threw himself on Latia Harris . The video of the brutal beating has gone viral and sparked a widespread outrage, since none of the bystanders seen in the footage came to Ferreira’s aid as she was being brutalized by the much larger woman; instead, they looked on with their cell phone cameras trained on the brawl. Caught: Latia Harris, 25, is in jail and now facing charges of assault and making terroristic threats . 'I think it’s messed up no one came to my rescue,' Ferreira told NBC Philadelphia. The only person to intervene on behalf of the woman was her 2-year-old, Xzavion Ortiz. The toddler is seen in the video repeatedly kicking Harris in the legs and screaming at her to stop hitting his mother. ‘I became so much closer to my son . because he didn't care what was going on,’ she said. ‘He wasn't afraid. He just wanted to defend his mom.’ Ms Ferreira explained to NJ.com that she used to work at the same Salem McDonald’s as Harris. Two . or three weeks ago, she stopped by the eatery to chat with some of her . former colleagues, and at one point Ferreira made an off-hand remark . about Latia Harris' alleged romantic relationship with her supervisor. Idle gossip: Ferreira (left) said her feud with Harris (right) started a couple of weeks ago when she dropped by the McDonald's where she once worked to chat with her friends and mentioned that Harris had a relationship with a manager . Different persona: Harris also goes by the name Alima Zawjatul Abdul Sabur . Family matters: The 25-year-old has two young children (pictured) and a large family in Philadelphia . According to Ferreira, the 25-year-old overheard her comment and became upset. In the weeks that followed, Harris kept calling her and saying that she could get fired over the bit of gossip. On Tuesday, Ferreira said she was walking home with her son at around 7pm when Harris ambushed her in a clearing behind the McDonald’s and smacked her. The 4-foot-9, 10-pound mother tried to reason with Harris and informed her that she did not want to fight, but the woman ignored her pleas, hurling Ferreira' to the ground. ‘I could have been dead right now, had she hit me in the right spot it would have been over, over nothing,’ Ferreira tearfully said. ‘McDonald’s isn’t worth it, a guy isn’t worth it.’ The people who witnessed the attack and did nothing to stop it have been condemned by local police and the media, but Ferreira cautioned against demonizing them, stressing in the interview that they should not be seen as ‘monsters.’ Face-off: Police in New Jersey have obtained this cell phone video showing a female McDonald's worker dressed in a burgundy uniform confronting a young mother in a wooded area in Salem . Pummeled: The attacker, identified as Latia Harris, pulled the 27-year-old woman to the ground in front of her 2-year-old son and proceeded to punch her in the face about 20 times . Speaking of her attacker, who is . currently being sought by police on assault charges, Ferreira broke down . in tears, saying she felt sorry for her because the woman has two . children. In a statement to ABC Action News Thursday night, Salem City McDonald's owner Jim Burlaga said he was . extremely disturbed by the incident, and that Harris will not be serving . his customers going forward. As of Friday morning, Ms Harris, who also goes by the name Alima Zawjatul Abdul Sabur, remained at large. Police believe she may have traveled to Philadelphia to stay with family. Police have obtained a copy of the video depicting the attack before it was removed from Facebook. The graphic footage shows the McDonald's employee pounding  Ferreira as a group of people stand around and watch in a wooded area behind the McDonald’s eatery on East Broadway in Salem. After the victim is thrown to the ground, the attacker proceeds to punch and kick her at least 20 times. The woman's toddler tries to intervene on his mother's behalf by kicking her assailant and yelling at her to stop. ‘Mommy!’ the little boy cries out. At one point, Harris threatens to beat up the 2-year-old. 'Monstrous': The victim's son tried to intervene by repeatedly kicking her attacker in the legs until Harris threatened to kick the 2-year-old in the face (right) No mercy: The assailant kicked the mother in the back as she lay on the grass in a fetal position with witnesses standing around her . ‘You better get your son before I kick him in the [expletive] face too,’ she screams. The beating ends with the McDonald's staffer spitting on Ferreira lying bleeding on the ground. Before . she walks away, the woman warns the brutalized young mother: 'It's not . over... you almost made me lose my job… stupid tramp.' Police officers were called to the scene just after 7pm after receiving reports of a woman covered in blood. They found the 27-year-old bleeding . profusely from her face and acting disoriented and confused. She was . taken to The Memorial Hospital of Salem County to be treated for injuries to her face. Salem Police Chief John Pelura III said in a statement to . MailOnline Thursday that criminal complaints have been signed against . Harris for aggravated assault and two counts of terroristic threats, but . she could face additional charges after her arrest. Bail for Harris has been set at $35,000. One of the complaints stated that Harris threatened to shoot the 27-year-old mother. According to the police chief, Harris has not returned to work since the Tuesday assault. Ominous warning: The 25-year-old allegedly threatened to shoot the victim as payback for nearly getting her fired from McDonald's before she spat on her and walked away . Her last known address is currently vacant and police are working to identify family members and potential locations of Harris’ whereabouts. 'Police in this county deal with this type of violence everyday. Yet, this video is physically sickening to watch,' Pelura stated. 'There is a moral and social breakdown in the fabric of our society which is clearly evident when a woman gets pummeled in broad daylight in front of her child while a dozen people pull out their phones to record the incident instead of calling for help.' He added: 'There is so little regard for human life - by the actor and the bystanders.'","Catherine Ferreira, 27, suffered a broken nose, two black eyes and a mild concussion .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The high school student who recorded his teacher yelling at him and saying he could be arrested for criticizing President Barack Obama says he wanted to laugh during his instructor's rant. Hunter Rogers has been revealed as the student who used his cell phone camera to tape the interaction. He said his social studies teacher at North Rowan High School in Spencer, North Carolina, has long been biased toward Obama during class discussions. Scroll down for video . Standing up for himself: Hunter Rogers says he was always taught that he had a right to criticize the president . 'Honestly, at the time i wanted to laugh at her,' Hunter told Fox News. 'I've been taught all my life that nobody can take your opinion or nobody can take your freedom of speech and she was telling me that I could be arrested for slander.' The teacher, identified as Tanya Dixon-Neely by WBTV, has since been suspended. The argument began when Ms Dixon-Neely started talking about a recent report that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had bullied a gay classmate in high school. As the teacher explains the allegations against Romney, Hunter asks: 'Didn't Obama bully somebody, though?' 'No disrespect': A teacher at North Rowan High School (pictured) in North Carolina told a student that he could get arrested for talking badly about the president . The teacher responds that she was not aware of Mr Obama being a bully. She begins to raise her voice telling the student not to make 'degrading' comments. The student tries to reply: 'If you're going to talk [about] Romney...' But he is interrupted by the teacher, who starts shouting. 'Uh-uh! Stop! Stop! No! Because there's no comparison. He [Mr Romney] is running for President. Obama is the President.' Rogers says this was typical behavior for the teacher. 'She always have open discussions about the president and candidates. And she doesn't want to hear anything but what she believes,' he said. 'And if you disagree you get berated and put down. I just decided to finally get some proof of it.' 'Stop! No!': When a student asked whether Obama was ever a bully, the teacher became enraged and demanded that the student say nothing negative about him . His mother, Gina Rogers, said she was horrified when her son played the recording for her. 'My biggest concern is that then this teacher is responsible for teaching my child and hundreds of others and she is not teaching them factual information,' she told Fox. The 10-minute video uploaded to YouTube last Monday appears to be taken from a cell phone where only voices can be heard and it does not show anyone inside the classroom. In the recording, Rogers says: 'If you're going to talk trash about one side, you gotta talk trash about the other.' However, the teacher disagreed. She said, 'Let me tell you this: you've got to realize this man is wanting to be what Obama already is, OK?' She continues, screaming: 'That's disrespect! That's disrespect!' The student contends that the teacher is the one being disrespectful - to Mr Romney. This infuriated the teacher. 'No comparison': When the student asked why it was OK to discuss Mitt Romney, the teacher said he should be treated differently as a candidate . She insists that the student follow her rule. The teacher cried out: 'You will not disrespect the President of the United States!' The student retorted: 'I'll say what I want.' She angrily counters: 'Not about him you won't.' As the exchange went on, the student told the teacher that he had different beliefs than her and when he asked a question about Mr Obama and bullying, the teacher got 'defensive' and 'freaked out.' Then he tries to reason with the teacher that plenty of people have talked badly about President George W. Bush. 'They can't take that away': The student did not believe the teacher when she said people have been arrested for talking bad about George W Bush . The teacher answered that the student needed to stop slandering the current President because 'people were arrested for saying rather poor things about Bush.' Unconvinced, the student offers his viewpoint: 'You would have to say some pretty f***ed up crap ... to be arrested. 'They cannot take away your right to have your opinion or your freedom of speech. They can't take that away... unless you threaten the President.' The teacher demands to know whether the student was aware that the police do not always read Miranda rights when a person gets arrested. The student responds: 'Well, I've never been arrested.' Biased: Gina Roberson (right), Hunter's mother, said she is concerned that someone so biased was teaching her son and hundreds of other students . After some minimal discussion on how government officials sometimes say negative things about presidents, the teacher make her case that negative comments about Mr Obama will not be tolerated inside her classroom. School officials who have reviewed the video say they will not share the teacher's name because it is a personnel matter. The woman has not been removed from the district. In a statement to the Salisbury Post, district spokeswoman Rita Foil said: 'This incident should serve as an education for all teachers to stop and reflect on their interaction with students.' Political analyst Michael Bitzer told the news agency that he was not aware of any arrests of people for negative comments they made about Mr Bush. He said: 'I think what this broke down to was a perceived personal slight by an instructor against someone she sees in a positive view, and things just went out of control from there.'

"By . Nick Harris . Sheik Mansour has now spent around £1billion on his Manchester City dream, but if he put every player up for sale this summer he would only be able to recoup £311million in proceeds. That at least is one debate-provoking conclusion raised by a new report, published today, that assesses the ‘market values’ of players in the squads at the 98 clubs across the top divisions in England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. City have the most valuable squad in the Premier League according to experts at the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory, who rate player values for summer 2014 by a wide range of ‘objective’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position, performance data and international experience. High earner: Sergio Aguero is Manchester City's most expensive player, according to the CIES Football Observatory . City’s most valuable player is Sergio Aguero, CIES say, with a market value of £40m, followed by David Silva (£27m) then Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure (both around £24m). The whole squad would make £311.3m if sold at market rates in the transfer window, the report says. Chelsea have the next most valuable squad who played in the Premier League in 2013-14 at £310.5m, followed by Liverpool (£300.8m), Arsenal (£288.7m) and Manchester United (£220.2m). It should be stressed these are sale values at ‘market rates’ this summer for all the players combined, and not what these clubs paid for those players. In many cases, not least at City, the players cost more than they are now worth. At the other extreme, Fulham’s squad is worth just £30.6m, or less than any 2013-14 Premier League team, and only slightly less than West Brom’s (£32.3m) and Crystal Palace’s (£33.9m). Key figure: Vincent Kompany's value is around the £24m mark, says the report . Time to cash in? Unhappy Yaya Toure is  valued at around the £24m mark also . Across Europe, Barcelona’s squad - with the world’s most valuable player Lionel Messi in it - is rated as worth £478.2m while Real Madrid’s, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in the ranks, is worth £393.5m in second place. Bayern Munich are next (£322.6m) followed by City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal. The more a squad is worth, the better it performed in the Premier League in 2013-14, by and large. The top four most valuable squads filled the top four places and most clubs finished within a handful of places of what might be expected given their resources. The two main exceptions were Palace, who finished in 11th place, or seven places higher than their squad ranked 18th in value; and Cardiff, who finished bottom, or six places lower than a squad worth the 14th most in the division. The top of the tree: With a squad value of £478.2m, Barcelona are the most expensive in Europe . The full report can be bought from the CIES website and the authors say: ‘From an economic perspective, it is worth highlighting results obtained by some of the clubs that were among those that spent the least to sign players fielded such as Crystal Palace in England, Elche in Spain, Guingamp in France, Augsburg in Germany and Verona in Italy. This publication will allow you to understand what factors permitted these clubs to over-perform.’ More details can be found at www.football-observatory.com .","It cost more than three times as much to assemble, but Manchester City's squad would cost £311m to buy .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . He is accustomed to staying at his large, private residence of Birkhall on the Balmoral Estate while in Scotland but today the Prince of Wales was given a taste of caravanning. Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland, spent a sunny couple of hours at Ballater Caravan Park, in Aberdeenshire, where he spoke with management and visitors. The park was taken over from the local authority by a charitable organisation which has overseen a range of improvements.

Charles attended without the Duchess of Cornwall, who is coming to terms with the sudden death of her brother, Mark Shand, last week. However, the engagement had always been intended to be a solo one for the prince, who left his wife at Birkhall.

Dave Monk, 36, his wife Rachel, 40 and sons Dylan, seven, and Lewis, five, were among the first to speak to the Prince. The family, from Blenheim in New Zealand, have been working their way around the world, spending this summer at the caravan park as wardens.

Mr Monk said: 'Kate and William (the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) just visited our home town and now we've got the future king of New Zealand here too. It's been great, and the kids have been excited.'","Charles visited Ballater Caravan Park in Aberdeenshire .

"President spent $190 on iTune gift cards and Just Dance 3 for the Wii . Picked up three pizzas for lunch . 'It'll be really embarrassing if it doesn't go through' Obama quips about his credit card . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 22:49 EST, 21 December 2011 . Home alone at the White House, Barack Obama headed on an impromptu Christmas shopping trip with first dog Bo today - making the most of his free time as Congress remained in stalemate over payroll tax cuts for next year. The President's wife and daughters are already on the family's annual vacation in Hawaii - a trip which has attracted scathing criticism for its estimated cost of $4million, funded by the American taxpayer. Obama is expected to fly to Hawaii in the next few days for his luxury vacation in a private beachfront villa. The alone time gave him the chance to pick up some cost-saving items in front of the cameras at PetSmart and Best Buy in Alexandria, Virginia - before indulging in pizza for lunch. Scroll down for video . President's best friend: Barack Obama picks up a bone and a bag of treats for first dog Bo at a pet store in Alexandria, Virginia today . Last minute gift buying: Obama checks out the prices of the doggy treats as he shopped with the help of a PetSmart employee in Virginia . At the pet store, Obama bought Bo . a $24.99 toy bone and a bag of treats, as the dog played with a . poodle puppy named Cinnamon. 'OK, Bo, don't get too personal,' Obama told the family pet as the two dogs sniffed around each other. The President then headed to Best Buy to shop for his daughters, Malia, 13, and ten-year-old Sasha. He purchased two $50 iTunes gift cards and two games – the Sims 3: Pets and Just Dance 3 for the Wii. He told reporters: 'If you're wondering – Just Dance for the Wii. The girls beat me every time on these various dance games. So you'll never get a picture of me doing it because I get graded F every time.' Obama spent around $190 and put it on a credit card, remarking to store employees: 'It'll be really embarrassing if it doesn't go through.' Mover and shaker: Obama picks up Just Dance 3 at Best Buy for his daughters Malia and Sasha but said they 'beat him every time' Making friends: The first dog Bo got a little close to a poodle named Cinnamon at the pet store . Obama then went to Del Ray Pizzeria and picked up three pies to go, stopping on the way back to the White House to wish onlookers happy holidays and pose for photographs with children. The commander-in-chief looked glad of the break from the stalemate in Congress over taxes and unemployment benefits for millions of Americans. The Republican-led House earlier rejected a short-term deal passed by Democrats and fellow Republicans in the Senate over the weekend and called for fresh negotiations on the expiring tax break that saves the average American worker $1,000 a year. As both sides dug more deeply into entrenched positions, House Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, demanded Obama order Senate Democrats back into session to haggle over a year-long extension. Slices for the secret service? Obama carries the three pies away from Del Ray Pizzeria in Alexandria . When Michelle's away...: His wife may lead the campaign on healthy eating but the President is known for his love of fast food . Ring it up: Obama joked with employees at Best Buy that it would be 'embarassing' if his credit card didn't go through . Shopping security: Obama leaves the stores surrounded by the secret service to return to the White House . And even among the happy shoppers, Obama encountered criticism over the Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline he has delayed. John Passacantando, 50, of Alexandria . said: 'I just said I disagreed with him on the pipeline but I love what . he's doing for the country otherwise.' Another . group invited the President to an office holiday party at their . Internet development company but he regretfully declined. Michelle Obama also proved herself a . fan of the favourite stores of middle America when she made an . 'impromptu' trip to Target in October. Dressed down in yoga pants, a . baseball cap and floral shirt, the First Lady picked up dog food and . cleaning products. However . the 40-minute run for errands was dismissed as a publicity stunt to . portray her as an 'ordinary mom' at the beginning of her husband's . re-election battle. Say cheese: Obama made time for a photo op while on a solo shopping trip from the White House . Heading home: The president took some time out for the stalemate over taxes in Congress . Wearing a Nike cap and sunglasses, the usually glamorous mother . walked in through the main entrance with just one assistant, an unknown . female aide. Secret Service officers reportedly swept the store on Highway 1, 30 minutes before Mrs Obama popped in to carry out her housewife duties. Unlike his wife's 'low-key' visit, the President's trip today was accompanied by scores of photographers and he was flanked by his secret service agents and team of White House staffers. The Obamas will be reunited when the President joins his wife and daughters on Hawaii where he was born for their Christmas vacation. Michelle, Malia and Sasha flew to Hawaii for a 17-day holiday on December 16. The separate flights will incur costs of more than $100,000 to the taxpayer. Just your average mom: First lady Michelle Obama, wearing a hat and sunglasses, center, stands in line at a Target Department store in October . Island life: Obama on the golf course at the Mid Pacific Country Club in Kailua, Hawaii (left) and walking along the beach with his two daughters . Time to relax: The Obamas have attracted criticism for the length - and expense - of their family vacations, pictured last year in Hawaii . The president's family covers the cost of a private beach front residence in Kailua, Oahu, for the vacation - a ‘Winter White House’ that costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month. But the local and federal taxpayers help pay the bill for travel and security. But taxpayers take care of housing for Secret Service, Coast Guard and Navy Seals who guard the rentals and arrive a day ahead of Mr Obama. That is about $21,600 per home for approximately seven houses rented for 18 days. There is also a hotel bill for $72,216.","President spent $190 on iTune gift cards and Just Dance 3 for the Wii .

"By . Paul Bentley . and John Stevens . A Somali Muslim allegedly stabbed a policeman and three mosque worshippers after screaming: ‘Allah is going to punish you all.’ The 32-year-old is said to have tried to kill the worshippers during an argument over whether they were praying correctly. It is thought the man, who was not a regular at the mosque in Birmingham, became upset because the prayers were not being performed in the manner of his denomination. Attack: The police officer and three other people were stabbed at a mosque (pictured with sign, right) in the Ward End area of Birmingham. The four are in a 'stable' condition, according to a police spokesman . Police at the scene of the incident. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder  after the attack . One witness, who asked not to be . named, said: ‘I heard shouting behind me as I was praying. I turned . around and saw two men grappling with each other. ‘Suddenly a man pulled out a knife and . stabbed the other man in the leg, near the groin. 'Someone tried to . intervene but the man just went for him and thrust a knife into his . abdomen. It was absolutely terrifying.’ Minutes later two police officers, one . male and one female, arrived at the Madrasah Qasim-ul-Uloom mosque in . Ward End and the man allegedly ran at them with a large combat knife. Despite the male officer shooting him with a Taser, the man is said to . have stabbed him in his chest and stomach. The suspect, a 32-year-old Somalian man, was taken to a secure mental health facility today . Hand wound: Dr Arshad Mahmood     had his hand stabbed by the knifeman in the Birmingham mosque . ‘The police tried to Taser . the man but he didn’t fall down,’ the witness continued. ‘Instead he . just lunged at the officer after pulling out his knife again and stabbed . him. There was blood everywhere.’ Despite his serious injuries the 31-year-old officer ‘heroically’ overcame the man. The officer was with his family in . hospital yesterday preparing for surgery. Two of the other men were . being treated for multiple stab wounds following the attack just after . 11pm on Saturday. An off-duty surgeon who happened to be at prayers fought to keep them alive before paramedics arrived. Another man, Dr Arshad Mahmood, who . had his hand stabbed while trying to disarm the attacker, said: . ‘Everyone was frightened. It was so sudden. The mosque is a converted house. Violence broke out shortly before 11pm on Saturday following late night prayers . ‘A man started stabbing one of the . guys who was just sitting right next to him. 'We went to save him. He had . multiple injuries, three or four wounds. 'A few of us went to stop him. One of the guys was strong enough to stop him. I held his hand. One also . had an injury on his thigh.’ Another witness said: ‘He shouted . “Allah is going to punish you all”. He stabbed two people then one guy . restrained him and someone called the police.’ The suspect was being . held yesterday in a mental health facility on suspicion of attempted . murder. The attack comes less than a month . after soldier Lee Rigby was murdered in Woolwich, south London, . allegedly by knifemen boasting they were avenging the death of Muslims . by the military. The male officer, who has not yet been . named, was due to receive a bravery award this week for helping to save . the life of a young child in a separate incident last year. Chief Superintendent Alex Murray, of . West Midlands Police, praised the policeman, saying: ‘There was some . real brave action going on inside that mosque.’ He added: ‘There’s no connection with . any other incidents that we can see at the moment – for example, . Woolwich or other incidents around the country. 'There’s no information . at this stage to suggest it was a hate crime.’ Many people living locally stood out on the street to watch what was happening as police maintained a presence in the area . West Midlands Police would be ‘looking into details’ about why the Taser had no effect on the suspect. Liam Byrne, MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, said: ‘This was not a hate crime, this was a tragic, sad, and isolated incident.’ Mohammed Shafiq, of national Muslim . organisation the Ramadhan Foundation, said: ‘We must be clear there . should be no place for this sort of violence in our country.’ An eyewitness said the stabbing happened after a row at the Madrasah Qasim ul Uloom mosque .

"By . Eleanor Harding . No one can accuse them of melting into the crowd. With their lurid pink and purple uniforms, the army of Olympic volunteers will be easy to spot. In fact the new outfits are so bright, Mayor of London Boris Johnson apologised for them yesterday. Britain's next top model? Boris Johnson gathered 30 Team London Ambassadors together to showcase the new uniform . Greeting some of the 8,000 'London . Ambassadors', who will guide tourists around the capital, he said: 'What . do you think of the uniform? 'It's quite striking, isn't it? I . hope you don't feel too ridiculous. We need to overcome our natural . British reserve and be a little bit more like the Australians!' Some observers even described the outfits as looking more like Percy Pig sweets from Marks & Spencer. They consist of a polo shirt with matching fleece, anorak and rucksack as well as a straw trilby with a pink ribbon. They are based on the Olympic 2012 logo, which MPs described as 'childish' when it was unveiled five years ago. The ensembles are based on on the . Olympic logo, which cost £400,000 to design but was lambasted by MPs as . 'childish' when it was unveiled in 2007. Hats off! The uniform - a loose tracksuit top and matching poloshirt - comes with a beige trilby trimmed with a pink ribbon . Hogging the limelight: The inspiration could have been a Marks & Spencer Percy Pig sweet . Magenta, one of the official Olympic . colours, has been chosen as the 'way-finding' colour and will also . feature on signposts for the games. Greeting the volunteers at Wimbledon . Station in South London, Mr Johnson added: 'I think the uniforms are beautiful. I have a rucksack in the same livery but it's not the same style. 'Whoever designed it needs a prize. It's very striking. It's positive. It's optimistic.' Asked whether he'd be wearing his . uniform to the games, he added: 'I wouldn't rule it out. I have a fleece . already but this could be a good replacement. 'It's in extremely good taste and style, and typical of London.' The uniforms were received with brave . faces from the Olympic ambassadors, who will be working as volunteers . during the games to help visitors navigate London. The volunteers will be stationed at . key points in the city such as airports and tourist attractions to give . directions and advice. Andy Von Hirshberg, 29, a brand . manager from London, said: 'The uniforms are interesting. I was a little . surprised at first saw them, but at least we'll stand out. I can live . with wearing pink and purple for a week.' Highly . visible: 8,000 people have volunteered to be London Ambassadors, to be . stationed at pods across the capital to welcome visitors and direct them . around the city - and the Olympics committee wanted them to be easy to . spot . Danielle Holdsworth, 41, a marketing . manager from London, added: 'This is the first time we've seen the . uniforms, and they're certainly bright. They are quite out there, but we . as ambassadors need to be out there so it's totally the right thing to . wear.' London Ambassador Barbara Edwards, . 65, said: ‘I like the trilby hat as it suits both men and women and will . be useful to have as we will be outside a lot of the time in the sun. The black bottoms are also practical and sensible. I don’t mind the . purple and the pink as you need to be visible and stand out and they’ve . obviously taken some of the logo colours. 'But . while the shirt is fine on the men, it gives a 'big pink bra' effect on . the women, which isn’t particularly flattering and will be more . noticeable on ladies with a larger bust.' It's that way! Boris tries out one of the Ambassadors' information pods for size . The ambassadors were selected from . more than 30,000 applicants and are aged between 14 and 85, speaking 40 . languages between them. Organisers said they were looking for people with good communication skills as well as knowledge of the city. They will volunteer for a maximum of five hours per shift and up to six consecutive days. Controversial: The London 2012 logo drew criticism for being gaudy and puerile . Also unveiled yesterday was the . design for the Olympic information kiosks – also in shocking pink - . which will be stationed at 43 locations in the city. Both have been designed by M . Integrated Solutions, based on guidelines set out by the the London . Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). The mixed response echoes the public reaction to the controversial London 2012 logo after it was unveiled in 2007. At the time, the London Olympic committee came under fire for approving the over-the-top design, which drew fierce criticism for being garish and 'childish.' Contemporary British designers were . near-unanimous in their disapproval of the logo, describing it as . 'confusing' and 'embarrassing'. Stephen Bayley, founder of the Design Museum, said it was 'a puerile mess, an artistic flop and a commercial scandal.' A two week public exhibition has opened at City Hall to give a taste of how London will look and feel during Games time. The exhibition will feature examples . of the colourful dressing and bunting that will be on display throughout . the city, plus a number of examples of how high streets and towns will . be getting involved with the celebrations.","One female Ambassador complains of 'big pink bra' effect .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Matt Lauer has responded to criticism for asking General Motors CEO Mary Barra if she can be both a good parent and a good executive by saying he'd have asked a male CEO the same question. Barra was interviewed on Thursday's Today Show and replied she believes she can be a good parent and a good CEO. Lauer took heat from dozens of Twitter contributors who said he wouldn't have questioned a male CEO like that. He insists he would have. Scroll down for video . Sexism scandal: Matt Lauer (right) landed in hot water after he asked GM CEO Mary Barra (left) about her ability to balance her role as a mother with her professional responsibilities during an interview Thursday . On-air exchange: Mrs Barra said she has the support needed to successfully balance her family and work life in response to Lauer's question, which he had drawn from a Forbes Magazine article . Lauer noted on his Facebook page Barra addressed the difficulty of balancing her work and home lives in a Forbes magazine article. He said if a man in a high-level job had publicly discussed the issue he'd have 'asked him exactly the same thing.' The 56-year-old TV presenter called work-life balance an important topic and said that as a married father of three he's familiar with it personally. Lauer traveled to Detroit Thursday to interview Barra, the first female CEO of GM, a day after the embattled automaker announced the recall of another 33,000 cars due to possible air bag defects. The wide-ranging interview addressed what so far has been a disastrous year for the automaker marked by a long series of recalls and the recent release of a damming report, which revealed that the company dragged its feet on critical safety issues. Lauer strikes back: The NBC [presenter wrote on Facebook that he would have asked a male CEO the same question had he made a statement about parenting . Mary Barra has been under fire ever since being appointed CEO earlier this year. Last week, she was called to testify for a second time before a House committee over GM's handing of the February recall of 2.6 million cars with defective ignition switches, which led to at least 13 deaths. 'A busy few days of travel from London to Detroit… I’m writing this update now from Denver. Thanks for all of the comments and feedback around our interview with GM CEO Mary Barra this morning. I wanted to share some thoughts around one of the questions that has started an important conversation. As part of the interview, I referenced this Forbes article (http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2014/05/28/exclusive-inside-mary-barras-urgent-mission-to-fix-gm/) where Barra talked about the challenge of balancing work life and home life. She said, “My kids told me the one job they are going to hold me accountable for is mom.” She had just accepted the job as the first female CEO of a major American automotive company, and in the article she said that she felt horrible when she missed her son’s junior prom. It’s an issue almost any parent including myself can relate to. If a man had publicly said something similar after accepting a high-level job, I would have asked him exactly the same thing. A couple weeks ago, we did a series on “Modern Dads” and the challenges of fatherhood today. Work-life balance was one of our focuses. It’s an important topic, one that I’m familiar with personally, and I hope we can continue the discussion. ' During the exclusive interview with Matt Lauer, Barra acknowledged that mistakes have been made and confirmed that several people had been fired from the company. When asked about allegations of a cover-up within the company, the GM CEO noted that there were 'silos of information' available, but blamed staffers for failing to act on the information with a sense of urgency. The recently hired CEO sounded a hopeful note, telling Lauer that she wanted GM to be a company that people can trust, and that the only way to do that was to remember their past mistakes. In the second part of the interview, Mrs Barra, who began her career in GM 30 years ago on the assembly line, insisted that her being a woman had nothing to do with her becoming CEO. ‘I believe I was selected for this job based on my qualifications,’ she told Lauer after the journalist asked about a theory bandied about in the media that she had been chosen to provide a softer image for GM. Lauer then brought up a recent statement made by Barra to Forbes Magazine about missing her son's junior prom: 'My kids told me the one job they are going to hold me accountable for is ""Mom.""' The NBC presenter asked Barra if she can do both jobs well given the pressures of her new job. In response, the head of GM stated: 'I think I can. I have a great team, we're on the right path. ... I have a wonderful family, a supportive husband and I'm pretty proud of the way my kids are supporting me in this.’ The exchange sparked a firestorm on social media and in the press, with critics lambasting Lauer for posing a question to Barra, GM's trailblazing female CEO, that he would not have posed to a man. Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden tweeted: ‘My suggestion: Maybe working moms should stop watching @MLauer.’ Wife and mother: Mary Barra, chief executive officer of General Motors Co., stands for a photograph with her daughter Rachel and husband Tony Barra at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit January 17 . Jugging act: Lauer, 56, who is married and has three children, said he is well-familiar with the topic of work-life balance . In a scathing opinion piece for the Detroit Free Press, columnist Tom Walsh wrote: ‘Would he ever contemplate asking Alan Mulally at Ford, or Sergio Marchionne at FiatChrysler, if they could be a good CEO and a good parent at the same time?’ Thursday afternoon, Mr Lauer took to his Facebook page and posted a lengthy statement addressing the allegations of sexism. He noted the question at the center of the controversy referenced Barra's own words quoted in the Forbes article. 'If a man had publicly said something similar after accepting a high-level job, I would have asked him exactly the same thing,’ Lauer insisted.","Matt Lauer interviewed Mary Barra in Detroit for a Today Show segment Thursday .

"By . Meghan Keneally . President Obama has paid tribute to President Kennedy at the Medal of Freedom ceremony today as he presented awards to former President Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, country singer Loretta Lynn and newspaper editor Ben Bradlee. In his opening remarks, Obama highlighted the slain President’s sister-in-law Ethel Kennedy, calling her ‘one of my favorite people’ in a room full of dignitaries. He went on to also give President Kennedy’s grandson Jack a shout out by praising his basketball skills. Aside from the fact that the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination comes this Friday, the Democrat was mentioned because he was the one to establish the Medal of Freedom initiative which is the highest civilian honor in the country. Presidential pals: Even though President Clinton criticized President Obama's health care roll out just a few days ago, the two seemed very comfortable with one another at Wednesday's ceremony . Quite the crowd: Six fellow honorees and President Obama clap for Clinton as his son-in-law, daughter and wife (bottom left) look on from the front row . Happy to be there: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one excited attendee and she and daughter Chelsea were in the front row to watch Bill receive the medal . His death on November 22, 1963 came two weeks before the first group of winners were due to receive their medals. President Bill Clinton is far from the . first former Commander in Chief to receive the award- in fact all but . four Republicans: Presidents Nixon, Ford and both Bushes- have been . granted the award by their predecessors. Back in public: Huma Abedin, Mrs Clinton's longtime aide, was also at the ceremony after staying out of the public eye following her husband Anthony Weiner's failed mayoral bid . When the list of this year’s 16 nominees was released in August, it was seen as a turning point in the Clinton-Obama relationship as the two Democrats started off at odds when Obama ran against the former President's wife Hillary in 2008 in a campaign that often times turned personal. Over the course of the past five years, the two men have worked hard to mend their relationship but there have been a few bumps in the road between the nominations and now. A tell-all book about the 2012 election revealed that Obama reportedly told aides that he could only take Clinton ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. They made an effort to hide any hard . feelings today, however, as Mr Obama spoke movingly about his fellow . Democrat. While was light-hearted during his remarks about the other . recipients, he made a point to slow down and take a more emotional tone . while praising Mr Clinton. Wowing the women: Among this year's 16 recipients were a number of female leaders including Gloria Steinem (left) and Oprah Winfrey (right) All smiles: Wednesday's award ceremony showed that in spite the fact that Oprah did little to campaign for the President in 2012 (even though she was one of his strongest advocates in 2008) there are no hard feelings . Look of approval: Former President Clinton looks up at Oprah as she receives her award . Big day: President Obama gives former President Clinton the highest civilian honor after praising him for his service and philanthropic work that helped save 'hundreds of thousands of lives' Proud: Hillary Clinton got a brief shout out from President Obama as well, as he thanked former President Clinton for being patient while his wife traveled all over the world as his Secretary of State . Mr Obama said that he appreciates the former President’s advice ‘on and off the golf course, and most importanty for your lifesaving work around the world which represents the best of America.’ He went on to give Mrs Clinton- who is widely expected to be the Democratic presidential candidate when Mr Obama’s second term ends in 2016- a shout out as well. ‘I am most grateful for (Bill Clinton’s) patience during his endless travels of my Secretary of State,’ he said. Mrs Clinton and their daughter Chelsea were in attendance at the ceremony held in the East Room of the White House. Mrs Clinton’s embattled aide Huma Abedin was also at her side, making a rare public appearance following her husband Anthony Weiner’s failed New York City mayoral bid. Other political players with close ties to the President were selected, including the late Senator Daniel Inouye, the former Hawaiian Senator who Obama eulogized at his 2012 funeral and called 'my earliest political inspiration'. In her place: Astronaut Sally Ride, who died in the Challenger explosion, was given the award posthumously to her life partner Tam O'Shaughnessy, who had been romantically involved with Ride for 27 years . Bringing it home: Country singer Loretta Lynn was praised for breaking boundaries in the music industry . Respect: In talking about the well-known women- including Gloria Steinem- President Obama said that they did so much to help young girls like his daughter see new role models . Former Republican Senator Richard ‘Dick’ Lugar was also honored on Wednesday. Obama co-sponsored a bill with Republican Senator Richard 'Dick' Lugar and they have remained close to this day. Lugar was such an influential figure to Obama that during the final presidential debate in 2008, Obama cited Lugar as one of the people 'who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House'. Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, who came to fame with his work during the Watergate scandal, was another notable inclusion. The President joked that in addition to Mr Bradlee’s military service and important work in the media, he was also jealous of how the editor is able to pull off fashion-forward shirts with white collars. ‘He always looks so cool in them,’ Mr Obama joked. Old friends: Senator Richard Lugar and Obama worked together when he first entered the national political scene and the Republican from Indiana took the Illinois-transplant under his wing . Partners in stride: Mrs Obama also attended the ceremony but she did not speak . Not to be outdone, the vertibale ‘Queen of all media’ was also a recipient of the storied award. Oprah Winfrey has been a longstanding supporter of the President, though many believed that their relationship may have soured after she did little to endorse him during the 2012 re-election campaign and skipped his second inauguration entirely. No tensions were present on Wednesday, however, as the President said ‘Michelle and I count ourselves among Oprah’s many devoted fans and friends.’ ‘Early in Oprah Winfrey’s career her bosses told her to change her name to Susie I often pause there because I got the same advice- not to Susie but to change my name,’ he said. Other key female leaders were among the honorees including women’s rights campaigner Gloria Steinem and astronaut Sally Ride, whose award was accepted posthumously by her life partner. Country music singer Loretta Lynn and Judge Patricia Wald who served on the International Criminal Tribunal were the two other female recipients.","President Kennedy established the Medal of Freedom award but was killed two weeks before the first recipients were honored .

"By . David Kent . Wayne Rooney should not shoulder the blame for England’s early exit from the World Cup according to Robin van Persie, who says the FA need to look at their own youth structure. Van Persie claims Rooney and England played well enough against Uruguay to win and go through to the next round, and supported his fellow Mancheser United striker, who was heavily criticised after England’s opening defeat by Italy. ‘I watched most of the game against Italy and the whole game against Uruguay, and I think it is a shame.

'He hit an unbelievable free-kick, had a good shot saved by the keeper, a header which hit the bar and he scored a goal. He’s not to blame, he gave his all for his country.

There are loads of companies trying to encourage people to play more sport. The more hours you spend playing football, combined with good coaches, that is what makes you a better player.

James Johnson, 63, were found in Sedona, Arizona - a desert town famed for its New Age . culture. Police officers believe the couple was gunned down at close range in an unprovoked and random attack as they vacationed in the area. Scroll down for video . Murder: Police have few clues in the killing of the New Hampshire couple found shot in their car on Friday . They are now investigating whether the couple was murdered by the same man who shot a deputy sheriff dead two days later. William Coleman, 50, was killed on Sunday as he responded to a . burglary. A man got out of a van and opened fire, striking Coleman under his bulletproof vest. It has now emerged that the woman who . met such a violent end lived a life devoted to folk music, travel and . spiritual healing practices. Link? Officers are investigating whether the couple were shot by the same attacker who killed deputy William Coleman on Sunday . Raynsford studied acupuncture and Eastern . medicine and operated a . business under the name the Village Shaman, the New Hampshire Union Leader reports. She studied music before moving to Nelson, New Hampshire with her late husband, Keith . Duesenberry, in the . 1970s to join the Monadnock Valley folk scene. Throughout the 1980s, she sang alto with a folk band called Heartsong, and more recently produced solo CDs, including an album called Oh Hear The Flowers Sing. 'She proclaimed herself a shaman on a . spiritual quest,' close friend Annie Ames added. 'She . would do what she wanted to do, going away to travel . and hike when she wanted to.' Ames insisted Raynsford would not have seen her death as tragic. 'Her voice and spirit will carry on,' Ames said. 'We all thought she had a guardian angel, but on that day I . guess the guardian angels were busy.' The victims were found in a late-model . red Subaru wagon, the same car Raynsford drove, Ames told the Union Leader. Johnson worked for the New Hampshire . Division of Parks and Recreation at Monadnock State Park, the paper . reported. The pair had become 'involved' in recent years, Ames said. Authorities are now searching for a . white Dodge or Chevy truck with a white camper shell seen in the area . before the bodies were found. Police . are investigating whether the killings linked to the shooting of deputy . sheriff William Coleman, 50, two days later, when he responded to a . burglary. Location: Interstate 17 connects the two locations where the couple and the sheriff deputy were shot . Vacation spot: The couple was found in Sedona, Arizona - known for its sandstone rocks and New Age culture . A man got out of a van and opened fire, striking Coleman under his bulletproof vest. The suspect was shot and killed by other . deputies. The Arizona Republic reported that Coleman and the couple . were all shot with a high-powered rifle. Both crime scenes are connected . by Interstate 17. The theory that the two shootings may be . the work of the same gunman could explain why the man decided to open . fire on the deputies, Deputy Jeffrey Sprong said. 'That [a connection] is definitely . something our investigators will look into,' Sprong said. 'It wouldn't . surprise me if it turned out to be the same guy.' Arizona police said the couple were shot . with a .223-calibre rifle at close range. Cartridge shells from the . weapon were found by authorities on both sides of the vehicle, . suggesting one of the victims was forced to wait in horror as their . companion was killed. Members of a Jeep club found them in their red older-model Subaru sedan at a remote turnout on Arizona 89A on Friday morning. It is not known how long they had been dead. Detectives are using receipts and other items found inside the vehicle to try to trace their steps and establish a timeline. Unprovoked: James Johnson and Carol Raynsford, both aged 63, were shot at close range while on vacation . She an adult daughter,Ginger, and a son, James, and recently welcomed a granddaughter, friends told the Union Leader. 'She was beautiful and spiritual. She was probably the purest, nicest woman I’ve met,' neighbour Geoffrey Howard said. 'It doesn't appear it was provoked in any way, that's what makes it so unusual and baffling for our detectives,' he said. Deputies are looking for an older white Chevrolet or Dodge pickup with an older camper shell and red ribbons hanging from the rear-view mirror seen in the area. They have posted a $1,000 reward. 'We're just hoping someone who drove by on this busy highway sometime this morning may have seen a car pull out fast or something suspicious,' says D'Evelyn. Some callers reported seeing the car parked at the turnout on Thursday, and detectives are using receipts and other items found inside the vehicle to try to trace their steps and establish a timeline.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. Air Force's F-16 fighter jets are a common sight above Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. But this week one roared into the sky with a major difference: there was no pilot in the cockpit. The unmanned test flight was a retired F-16 retrofitted by maker Boeing as a drone - the first time one of the jets has flown without a pilot, the company said. Renamed the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, the reconditioned aircraft are intended to give U.S. fighter pilots an realistic adversary to train against. Scroll down for video .

Two U.S. Air Force test pilots remotely flew the QF-16 from a ground control station at Tyndall. While in the air, the QF-16 mission included a series of simulated manoeuvres, reaching supersonic speeds, returning to base and landing, all without a pilot in the cockpit. 'It was a little different to see it without anyone in it, but it was a great flight all the way around,' said U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Ryan Inman, Commander, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron. 'It’s a replication of current, real world situations and aircraft platforms they can shoot as a target. Now we have a 9G capable, highly sustainable aerial target.'

Before the QF-16, the military used a QF-4 aircraft, which was a modification of the F-4 Phantom, a now well outdated, Vietnam-era fighter. But the modified QF-16 provides pilots a target that performs closer to many jets flying today. The QF-16s were all retired aircraft. Boeing retrieved them from Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and restored them for flight. Next live fire testing moves to Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.

"By . James  Nye . Father and daughter: Cate Edwards has given an interview in which she discusses the harrowing past 20-odd-years of her family's life and how she and her father, John Edwards (both pictured here during his trial in 2012) are now moving on as business partners together . The daughter of John Edwards has revealed her father summoned her to the family's palatial North Carolina mansion to confess his affair - while his cancer-stricken wife Elizabeth was waiting, 'elsewhere in the house'. Meeting her in the library of his multi-million dollar Chapel Hill estate in the summer of 2007, or 2008, the disgraced politician sat his Ivy-league educated eldest daughter down and admitted he had cheated on her mother. 'It was important from dad's perspective to be honest with me,' Cate Edwards said to The Washington Post magazine in an interview to celebrate her new partnership with her father on his successful return to practicing law. 'He was very emotional in telling me...We hugged and I said, 'I love you'. That's generally how it went. He was, he was upset,' said Cate, about her father who recently won $13 million in a personal injury case for his client. However, worse was to come and in August 2008, the news emerged that Edwards had fathered a child with his one-time aide, Rielle Hunter and his campaign to become president imploded - as did his marriage to Elizabeth, after Christmas, one year later. On December 7, 2010, days after Cate, now 32, was engaged to her college sweetheart Tevor Upham, her mother passed away after battling cancer for almost six years. Presidential campaign: Former US senator John Edwards with his family in January 2008, with his wife Elizabeth (R) and children Emma Claire, Jack and Cate in New Orleans. At this time Elizabeth knew of her husbands affair - but he had told her it was a one-night stand . In 2012 her father came close to prison during his trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws, but Cate stood by him. She stood by him even after the revelation during that trial of the harrowing moment her mother ripped open her blouse to show Edwards her breast cancer surgery scars after The National Enquirer first reported his affair in October 2007. However, despite the tumultuous past ten years of her family's lives, Cate told The Washington Post that nothing would ever compare to the death of her older brother, Wade, in 1996. Her family life up until that moment was perfect. Her father was a millionaire trial lawyer in Raleigh - a champion of the disenfranchised and poor. Standing side-by-side: Former U.S. Sen. John Edwards and his daughter Cate Edwards during jury deliberations in 2012. Cate Edwards was a constant presence for her disgraced father during his trial. Much to the amazement of some members of the public . Her mother, Elizabeth, was a successful attorney too. The Edwards were golden in every way. Then, one spring weekend when Cate was 14 a state trooper knocked on the door and told the family that her brother had died in a freak car accident. 'I remember my dad collapsing,' said Cate to The Washington Post. 'He fell, not just fainted. He just sort of collapsed. He was inconsolable.' Cate recalls her parents falling apart in the aftermath of their eldest son's death. So much so that Cate moved into their bedroom to console them. Indeed, friends of Cate told The Washington Post that anyone's shock at the support John Edwards receives from his daughter, needs to understand this time in their lives. 'For them, the worst had already happened,' says Sunjung Kim, Cate’s roommate for four years at Princeton. 'Everything that came after was just something to be dealt with.' Close: Cate Edwards told The Washington Post magazine that she felt angry towards her father because of the hurt he caused her mother, Elizabeth, pictured. Cate told The Washington Post that she wouldn't discuss her mother and father's marriage but that Wade's death was integral to her relationship with her father. 'I’m really not going to get into their relationship,' said Cate. Affair: Rielle Hunter and daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter. John Edwards infidelity has not meant that Cate Edwards does not see her half-sister. However, Cate has no relationship with Rielle . 'In terms of my relationship with the two of them, when you’ve been through the things we’ve been through together, this wasn’t like losing Wade. It was not as bad. 'It was hard in its own way. It had its own beats. It was difficult. We had been through a lot together and over a long period of time. So there was repairing that needed to happen, but it’s not like I felt like it was a relationship that was lost.' Elizabeth and John decided to have more children and two years after his son's death, John Edwards won the 1998 election to the Senate. He ran alongside John Kerry as vice-president on the defeated 2004 Democratic ticket and then just two days after that in November, Elizabeth was diagnosed with cancer. Then, fatefully, on February 21, 2006, Rielle Hunter walked into the bar at Lowes Regency Hotel in New York and saw John Edwards telling him, 'You're so hot!' Their disastrous affair was discovered by Elizabeth in December 20006, but at the time and prior to The National Enquirer revelations, Edwards told his cancer-stricken wife it was a one-night stand. Tragedy: Former Democratic vice presidential nominee  John Edwards, his children Jack (C) and Cate (R) leave the church after the funeral for Elizabeth Edwards in Raleigh, North Carolina December 11, 2010 . The fortunes of the Edwards spiraled until they reached a head on the day of John Edwards' verdict in 2012. Having escaped jail through a hung jury, Cate stood beside her father and let it be known she was standing by her disgraced father. Now, six months after Cate joined forces to create the Edwards Kirby law firm, they are looking to the future. 'I had my moments of self-pity,' she told The Washington Post. 'I’ve never reacted with anger exactly. I mean, you know I was angry at my dad for a while. We worked on, we worked very hard to repair our relationship. 'That’s always a secondary emotion for me; it’s never my primary emotion. ... I’ve gotten a great education and had wonderful friends and blessed with parents who love me and great siblings, and it’s hard to ignore those blessings. Focal point: The death of Wade Edwards in 1996 bonded Cate, her father and mother in a way that only those who have gone through something similar can appreciate according to her friends . Happier days: In 2011 Cate Edwards married - moving her life on in light of her recent tragedies . 'Bad things can happen to you, but it’s not that they overwhelm you when you recognize the blessings you have and the people you have, because that’s always what gets you through that sadness and those difficult times. And I had Trevor, too.' Admitting she has no relationship with Rielle, Cate does see her half-sister, Frances Quinn, who is six-years-old. Indeed, in April, Cate and her father were turned away when he tried to get into socialite Bunny Mellon's funeral in Virginia. The financial relationship between the disgraced politician and the reclusive heiress nearly twice his age was made public during the former Senator's 2011 trial which delved into the alleged misuse of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that Mellon gave to Edward's campaign. Her money was largely used to cover up the extramarital affair he had with Rielle Hunter and their love child. Dream over: Despite his loss on the 2004 Democrat ticket with John Kerry (pictured) John Edwards was seen by many as a future president of the United States . Though he was found not guilty of illegally using the more than $700,000 Mellon donated, he has apparently not won back the support of the now-deceased socialite's family. Bunny, whose real name was Rachel Lambert Mellon, died from natural causes on March 17 at the age of 103. The New York Post reports that Edwards showed up to Mellon's funeral in Upperville, Virginia on Friday with his eldest daughter Cate but they were given the cold shoulder. When they arrived, they were kept out of the service at Trinity Episcopal Church and forced to stand in an adjacent parish with the rest of the overflow crowd. They were able to watch actor Frank Langella give the eulogy and Bette Midler sing 'The Rose' but only from a live stream projection on a big screen. 'The service may have been open to the public, but he was not welcome,' NY Social Diary blogger David Patrick Columbia told The Post.","Cate Edwards, 32, has revealed her disgraced father summoned her to their North Carolina home .

A 19-year-old University of Maryland lacrosse player was arrested at an outdoor concert in Virginia Sunday night after allegedly groping a 49-year-old mother passed out on the lawn. Prince William County Police say the woman fell asleep on the Jiffy Lube Live lawn during a Zac Brown Band concert, when she woke up to find teen Benjamin Chisolm  touching her inappropriately. Chisolm walked away after the attack but was later arrested for public intoxication and now faces additional charges of aggravated sexual assault.

The victim, identified as 'Donna', has come forward to dispute details of the police report and reveal the exact nature of the sexual assault.

She says she did not fall asleep at the concert, but had gotten overheated and needed to sit down. Her daughter was cooling her off with a cold water bottle when Chisolm sat down next to her.

That I didn't give permission.' Chisolm, of Davidsonville, Maryland, is a rising freshman at the College Park school. Serious allegations: The University of Maryland issued a statement, saying they are taking the assault seriously. Above, an aerial view of the concert venue .

"By . James Rush . It's certainly not everyone's cup of tea and can cause those not used to DIY hours of agonising over missing screws and parts that don't fit as they become increasingly frustrated while putting up their flatpack furniture. But one handyman has now come to their aid after becoming a full time professional flatpacker. Denver Thornton, 36, who studied cabinet making at university, relishes the challenge of piecing together the household goods and says he regularly gets called out by those in a spot of bother. Denver Thornton makes a living by building flatpack furniture for those who struggle with DIY . Mr Thornton, of Beckenham, south east London, said: 'Not everyone has the energy, patience, skills or tools to put together furniture. 'I’ve been trained to do this and I absolutely love it - it’s like playing around with wooden lego. 'People go to IKEA and buy all their furniture, but when they get it home they haven’t the faintest idea of what to do with all the pieces. 'It makes sense for a professional to do it for you - flatpacks are only in a box to get them through your front door, cars start in bits but you wouldn’t try and put one together on your own. 'I get called out by people all the time who are in the middle of building something and it’s about to fall on top of them.' Mr Thornton, who co-owns the furniture assembling company Unflatpack.com with business partner John Griffin, says no job is too big for his expertise. Mr Thornton studied cabinet making at university and says he regularly gets called out by DIY novices . Mr Thornton, of Beckenham, south east London, said: 'Not everyone has the energy, patience, skills or tools to put together furniture' He said: 'Sometimes you’ll walk into a room where someone has tried to assemble the furniture and it’s just a big mess. 'I’ve even had men ask me to finish the job extra quick as they’ve lied to their wives that they’ll assemble it by the time they get home, and they want to take the credit. 'The most difficult piece of furniture to assemble has got to be the IKEA Hemnes day bed - it can be quite tricky as it has lots of components. 'The piece I hate doing the most is the Billy book case. Mr Thornton, who co-owns the furniture assembling company Unflatpack.com with business partner John Griffin, says no job is too big for his expertise . 'It’s just so easy and monotonous, I prefer a challenge. 'There’s only been one time when I wondered if I was ever going to finish a job - a customer had brought a media unit that was huge - 12 by 8 foot and weighed about a quarter of a ton. 'It must have taken about five of us to lift and put together.' Mr Thornton began his interest at the age of ten and started working as a cabinet maker when he left school before going on to study the subject at university. He said: 'I passed with a distinction but I wasn’t sure what to do next so I went to the job centre. 'The lady there told me there was such a job as a flatpack assembler. Mr Thornton began his interest at the age of ten and started working as a cabinet maker when he left school before going on to study the subject at university . 'When I tell people what I do for a living I get one of three reactions. 'The first is shock as they never even knew the service existed, the second is that it sounds like a great business idea, and the third is that they wouldn’t need to hire me as they could do it themselves - they’re usually wrong.' Since Mr Griffin started Unflatpack.com in 2005, the company has gone from strength to strength, and it now works in partnership with some of the biggest homeware brands in the UK. Mr Thornton, who charges £30 an hour for his flatpacking services, said: 'We’re now the official assembly partners for The Range and in talks with other big brands. 'We have a national presence now and have about 150 fitters that cover the whole of the UK.'","Denver Thornton helps those who struggle with flatpack furniture .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . If you value comfort and space, these are probably not the homes for you. A team of students from the US and UK have designed tiny houses for ‘affordable’ living. The 3D printed homes are intended to provide an alternative for young adults struggling to get on the property ladder. Young adults may soon be living in shell-like 3D printed homes if a project to build mini houses is realised. These 3D printed abodes would be intended to provide an alternative for the many young adults struggling to get their foot on the property ladder . The students from 3M future Lab, led by Professor and architect Peter Ebner, studied at the University of California and the University of Huddersfield. University students in Atlanta announced the other day they have designed mini-houses for urban living. 'SCADpads' are 8 feet wide, 16 feet long and can fit in US parking spaces. Each $40,000 abode can be individually tailored and decorated. The team says half of America's 105 million parking spaces are empty. And the 'housing crisis' could be solved by filling them with these homes. Their mini-homes are about 50 square foot (4.6 square metres) and were designed as a part of a project on ‘Small Transportable Living.’ The houses are entirely 3D-printed, providing a cheaper living solution than modern homes. The houses are dome or mussel shaped and could be placed in various locations around the world. Their portability and small size means that, in theory, they could be taken to places where regular houses could not be placed. When closed, the top level of the home serves as a bed with the ‘spring mattress’, which is also 3D printed. The closed structure is entered and exited via a small door located on the wall. A projector is also included inside, allowing multimedia such as movies to be viewed inside the mini-home. At the top a small eye-like window provides light inside the claustrophobic environment. On the ‘ground floor’ is a movable kitchen countertop. This also has a sink that covers a ‘bathtub’ of sorts. A small kitchen can be extended that, apparently, is comfortable enough for two people. There’s even a fridge for you to store food and drink. And Ebner tells MailOnline that the illustrations you can see here are accurate representations of how much space would be inside each of the prototype houses. He stresses, however, that he will not be bringing the products to market - they are merely intended as an example to show what is possible. All the parts for the homes are 3D printed and then put together, including the bed and the sewage system . Here the 'bedroom' area is shown with a 'spring mattress' to sleep on. The team of students, headed by Professor and architect Peter Ebner, developed the 3D printed houses to offer comfortable accommodation on a smaller but much more affordable scale . Last year, the graduate students of 3M futureLAB teamed up with other students from Germany and England to explore the topic of Small Transportable Living. The students from 3M future LAB studied at the University of California and University of Huddersfield . A projector inside the home allows you to watch TV shows and movies while you are 'relaxing' The ‘bathroom,’ also found on the ground floor, has a folding toilet that is hidden in the wall when not in use. The house even has a shower as well. The entire home is designed to be 3D printed, including the electricity, heating, water, sewage systems and thermal insulation. ‘Returning to the 3D printing topic, it is necessary to underline that the apartment was printed on a highly detailed level,’ the company said in a release. On top of the world: The designers suggest their 3D printed homes could be placed in less accessible locations around the world such as, supposedly, on top of mountains and hills . The industrial 3D printing process is shown here through which the homes are created . ‘So for example you can see the mattress springs, heating, water, electricity sewage systems and thermal insulation.' However, according . to the company, heater and water treatment devices are not able to be . printed yet so non-3D printed replacements are used for now. The hope is that the finished fully-3D printed homes could provide a solution for housing young adults around the world. It is rumoured that a Chinese company is interested in manufacturing the product on a large scale to the order of hundreds. Ebner says he is not involved in talks with them at the moment, but he would be involved 'for sure' if they got in touch. Coming to a city near you? The unique shell-homes are shown here on display in a city street, where they could provide cheaper and more accessible living for young adults . All of the components of the houses are 3D printed save for the heating and water treatment devices . Is this the future of living? Five of the 3D apartment designs are shown at a dockland here .","A team of students from the US and UK have developed tiny homes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A shocking new story reveals that the U.S. army inadvertently had an 8-year-old boy turn into a spy and place electronic tracking devices on his surrogate father so that they could spot him and kill him in a scheduled drone attack. The 8-year-old boy and his biological father have confessed to helping spy on the al Qaeda officer, and now the biological father is believed to have been executed while the fate of the young boy remains unknown. The thorough story was reported by The Atlantic, who claim that the boy, named Barq al-Kulyabi, helped lead American drones to an al Qaeda operative named Adnan al-Qadhi who had been placed on the U.S. ‘kill list’ due to his role in the Yemeni branch of the terrorist organization. Scroll down for video . Spy kid: Barq, 8, was recruited by his biological father's colleagues to place tracking chips in the coat of the man who had taken him in and cared for him, who happened to be an al Qaeda officer . The story of how Barq went from living on the streets of a small village to covertly placing electronic trackers on a man less than two days before he was killed in a drone strike is a heart-breaking one filled with family allegiances and financial struggles. Barq was sent away by his father and mother who lived in Sanaa to go live with a wealthier distant relative in the smaller town of Bayt al-Ahmar, where al-Qadhi lived. Barq's family were not among Yemen's most unlucky, as both parents were alive and the father was employed by the Yemeni Republican Guard, but their growing family and his small salary was not enough to support him. The Republican Guard is an elite faction of the country’s military, and they have worked with U.S. forces in the past in order to help locate terrorists. Unbeknownst to both Barq and his father, Hafizallah al-Kulaybi, in the early fall of 2012, the U.S. had called upon the Republican Guard to help them locate Qadhi. Family ties: Barq's biological father, Hafizallah al-Kulaybi (left), had sent the boy to live with extended family because he had too little money to feed his five other children, but those relatives rejected Barq (right) and he began living on the street until Adnan al-Qadhi took him in and cared for him . Because of the Kulaybi’s financial situation, Barq was sent away while his five brothers and sisters stayed with his parents in Sanaa. After months of Barq scavenging for plastic bottles to sell and living off food and shelter where he could get it. At one point, al-Qadhi took pity on him and brought Barq in his home to live among his own five children. Target: Adnan al-Qadhi (pictured) was on the U.S. 'kill list' and Kulyabi's superiors in the Yemeni Republican Guard- which supports American forces- arranged to have Barq place tracking devices on Qadhi . In addition to giving the young boy food, clothing, and a warm place to sleep, he also paid for his education. By that time, American officials approached the Republican Guard about finding Qadhi, who they believed to be a top al Qaeda operative who was vaguely connected to a thwarted suicide attack on a U.S. base in Sanaa. Some members of the Republican Guard knew that Barq's biological father, Kulaybi, needed money and that Barq was being cared for by al-Qadhi. In order to make the connection, the Republican Guard offered to give Barq's family a new house, car and 50,000 Yemeni iyals which converts to about $230. Kulaybi struck a deal with his higher-ups and drove from Sanaa to Bayt al-Ahmar, which was only a few miles away, to pick up his once-dismissed son. The Atlantic reported that Barq was thrilled to be reunited with his parents and siblings for a few days, and then his father took him to a meeting with Republican Guard officials on October 25, less than two weeks before the 2012 presidential election. During the meeting, they taught the boy how to activate the electronic chips and stressed how important it was for the boy not to tell Qadhi about the devices, adding that he needed to plant them on the target a week later. Barq's biological father, Kulaybi, then drove his son back to Bayt al-Ahmar and the boy re-established contact with his former surrogate father. Qadhi took Barq back into his home, and on October 31, the pint-sized spy made his move. 'I climbed on the table where his coat was and put [a tracking chip] in his pocket,' Barq recounted later in a confession video. A world away: Just hours after President Obama was re-elected, the drone strike took place that killed Qadhi and another colleague using the tracking data that the chip Barq planted had helped collect . He also put a second chip beneath a cupboard, but he later removed that one because he feared that it was going to be spotted. The tracking device was planted on the 31st, and a week went by- an important one where Barack Obama was re-elected- before the drone strike was actually ordered. A day after the votes were counted, a drone struck Qadhi and a colleague as they were driving. White House officials denied the version of events to The Atlantic, taking particular issue with the implication that they recruited an 8-year-old to do their dirty work. 'The claim that the U.S. government was in any way involved in purportedly using an 8-year-old in this incident is unequivocally wrong,' a White House spokesman told the magazine. While the U.S. got their target, al Qaeda eventually got theirs as well, capturing Barq and his father and forcing them to make a confession video where they explain what Republican Guard officers they had spoken to and what their roles in the set up were. The video was released on the internet, publicly releasing the confession, but they have not addressed the status of Kulaybi or his son. Local sources told The Atlantic that Kulaybi was undoubtedly executed, though al Qaeda may have spared the 8-year-old because they claimed his innocence was taken advantage of by his father.","New allegations claim that an 8-year-old Yemeni boy who was abandoned by his biological family was then roped back into their clutches .

"By . James Gordon . When it comes to trying something new, one grandmother proves you're never too old to start. For Ria Van den Brand, a 78-year-old grandma from the Netherlands, knowing she was due to take her first ever flight, she was determined to conqeur her fear of flying by doing something a little closer to the ground. She decided to head to a theme park and take her first-ever roller coaster ride, figuring if she could take the twists and turns that it had to offer, flying would smooth-sailing by comparison. Scroll down for video... Starting out: An elderly grandmother from Holland took a ride on a high-speed roller coaster for the very first time to get over her fear of flying. Ria, 78, had a fear of heights but the coaster wiped those fears away . Upside down: The ride quickly gathers speed and flips 180 degrees . Laughing through life: Throughout the ride, the grandmother never stops smiling . As part of phone company Vodafone's First ad campaign, Ria clambered aboard the white-knuckle ride with a spring in her step and a smile on her face. She was accompanied by her granddaughter, Daisy, who was sitting off-camera, as they ride Formule X at Drievliet amusement park in The Hague, Netherlands. Take it to the limit: A new ad campaign from European telecom provider Vodafone pushes people to experience something for the first time . Ria has the time of her life laughing and screaming her way through the thirty second thrill ride . Ria is from the Netherlands and has apparently found something new to love! The experience is over almost as soon as it starts, but throughout the ride, which took just 45-seconds, the smile didn't leave Ria's face once. As the coaster twists and turns its way along, Ria laughed, smiled and screamed with what appears to be joy (though terror could easily have been mixed in!) Her obvious enjoyment is wonderful to watch, particularly at the end of the ride, when she asks, 'How's my hair?' The grandma closes the video by making sure she still looks good for the camera. The Dutch grandma proves that there is no age limit on conquering your fears . Incredible: As the ride draws to a close, the grandma asks if she still looks good for the camera . After the ride was all over, it was time for the big event with grandma Ria teaming up with another lady who had also never flown before. An Bernaards, 71, also had a serious fear of flying and while Ria was riding her rollercoaster, Mrs Bernaards prepared to get airbourne by taking part in a flight simulator ride..

"By . James Gordon . A defenseless Pit Bull squealed and gasped for air as her owner grabbed her by the collar and squeezed her throat shut. 21-year-old Asani Woods from Louisiana is now behind bars after he allegedly beat his pit bull unconscious with boxing gloves. According to sheriff's deputies, Woods was arrested after a video of the December beating was found on a cell phone belonging to a drug suspect, Johnny Dominick. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES AND VIDEO... Booked: Asani Woods, left, was booked on the charge of aggravated cruelty in dog's beating. Johnny Dominick, right, initially was booked on drug-related charges but later also was booked on the charge of being an accessory to aggravated cruelty of a dog . Before it all began: Tiger the pitbull was a loving and sweet dog before the brutal attack . Choke hold: Woods grabbed hold of the Pit Bull around its neck to cut off its air supply . Rage: Using boxing gloves, Woods begans to strike the dog around its  head and force it into the garbage . Woods is accused of violently beating Tiger the pit bull because she made a mess in the kitchen. On March 26, authorities arrested 21-year-old Johnny Dominick on drug charges. When they checked his cell phone for evidence, they discovered the disturbing video. The video shows Woods choking the defenseless dogs as he held her by the throat, knocking her head against the wall and then forcing the pet into garbage. Woods appears angry and wears boxing gloves as he begins beating the dog with his fists. Jailed: Asani Woods was booked with aggravated cruelty in beating of his dog . Brutal: The dog is dragged across the floor by its neck towards the pile of garbage on the kitchen floor . Punished: Woods was seen beating the dog in the head and body as Tiger whimpered and cried during the attack . The pit bull yelped in agony in between blows to the stomach and head by a fist encased in a boxing glove and rapid kicks to her scrawny midsection. Although Tiger whimpers and cries out numerous times, she eventually appears to be unconscious. Investigators say after the female pit bull was knocked unconscious, Woods picked up the dog and hurled her across the room against the wall before smashing her to the floor. According to deputies, Woods claimed during questioning that he was 'disciplining his dog' after it created a mess in his kitchen. 'Yeah that was me. What you going to arrest me because I beat my dog because it sh*t and pi**ed all over my house?' he asked during his arrest. Woods claimed the incident happened in December and that Tiger survived the assault. Deputies say Woods later brought the pit bull to an animal shelter in January. Relentless: Woods picked up the dog before he smashed her to the floor . Excuse: Upon questioning, Woods said that he was disciplining his dog, which had created a mess in the kitchen . That shelter ended up euthanizing the dog because Woods allegedly told shelter employees that the pit bull was overly aggressive. Woods is charged with aggravated cruelty to an animal. Dominick, 21, is charged with principle to aggravated cruelty to an animal and a number of drug counts. Dominick, who allegedly recorded the incident is heard egging on Woods to continue the attack. St. Bernard Sheriff Jimmy Pohlmann said the 'video is very disturbing.' He said the abuse is brutal and he has never seen 'an incident such as this captured on video.' 'He thought it was no big deal and that law enforcement wouldn’t care about such an incident,' Pohlmann told reporters during a news conference. Out of it: By this point, the dog was unconscious . Pohlmann said the video was specifically disturbing, as the dog appeared to be defenseless: . 'You hear often times about pit bulls attacking individuals, you know, well, this is probably one case where you would like to see the pit bull defend himself, with such a brutal attack.' Although Woods denies he did anything wrong, he was arrested for beating his dog. He is currently being held in the St. Bernard Parish Prison on $100,000 bond. In addition to the drug charges, Dominick is now charged as an accomplice in the beating, as he filmed the abuse and failed to intervene. Dominick was released on Monday after posting $135,000 bond. Asani Woods denies beating his dog until she was unconscious. However, he contends that she deserved the punishment as she made a mess in his kitchen. Woods remains in jailed on $100,000 bail. A conviction on a charge of aggravated cruelty to an animal carries a prison sentence of one to 10 years.

"By . James Gordon . An outspoken, conservative Republican congressman from Texas, was letting his own staff and volunteers work and even sleep on the floor in filthy, disgusting conditions, whilst he campaigned for re-election. The campaign headquarters of Texas House Republican and Senate candidate Steve Stockman were shut down after they were deemed 'unsafe for habitation.' Talking Points Memo filed a request to see the photos of the condemned building, and managed to obtain pictures showing what looks like the decaying debris and detritus of a dilapidated dorm room. Toilet training required: Pictures have been released that show the disgusting conditions volunteers working for outspoken Texas Republican Steve Stockman, were working in . Hell-hole: Incredibly, between six and eight staffers and volunteers were sleeping here each night - even though there was no proper bedding or fire safety precautions . The photos show exposed electrical outlets, furniture that is literally falling apart and levels of hygiene that leave much to be desired, together with a filthy George Foreman grill. The place looks as though it is falling apart at the seams, and yet Stockman's campaign staffers were spending the night in the building that was a former motorcycle shop. The place is about as far away from a 'political campaign office,' as can be imagined. It's hard to know where workers would have conducted strategy meetings, let alone plugged in laptops safely or even had the desire to cook from the greasy grill. Controversy: Steve Stockman is no stranger to drama having already this year attempted to give away a rifle to subscribers to his online mailing list and suggested that unborn babies should be given handguns . Things got so bad the fire marshal and city building officials in Webster, Texas ended up ordering the emergency closure of the unorthodox campaign headquarters. Despite the commercial building was considered 'unsafe for human habitation', according to Webster city records, between six and eight staffers continued to work and sleep there. Inspectors found bunk beds had been added in the commercial building, but there were no smoke detectors or fire extinguishers. Among the fire code violations were faulty or spliced wiring and other electrical hazards, including no illuminated exit signs, improper exit doors and combustible material - mainly Stockman's campaign signs, according to the Houston Chronicle. Furthermore, no one had obtained the necessary permit for the campaign to legally occupy the pale yellow two-story metal building. Some HQ! The campaign was ran out of a rusty old motorcycle shop based at the end of a junkyard that was falling apart both inside and outside. Despite not paying any rent on the building the campaign is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt . Right wing: Congressman Stockman sells himself as the most conservative member of Congress, though he has not been ranked as such . Stockman represents a district of southeast Texas that was created as a result of the 2010 census, so he is the first to serve as its representative. He previously served as a congressman from 1995 to 1997. While his local staff is focusing on re-election efforts, his campaign is also digging itself further into debt. According to its latest report, Stockman's campaign committee has only $32,000 and debts of $163,000, including funds owed to the congressman himself. At the time of his re-election in 2012, Stockman praised his campaign workers and mentioned that some had even slept on the mucky floor. 'I could not have done it without . all the hard-working, grass-roots volunteers. Believe me, we had them - . young conservatives who came into an old motorcycle shop, worked the . precincts and made phone calls, slept on the floor, and ate . microwaved-meals. There's nothing like volunteers who believe in a . candidate and a cause.' Campaign finance reports show that the Stockman campaign bought 'bedding for overnight volunteers' in February 2012 at Wal-Mart. The campaign also bought air conditioning equipment and $812 in 'remodeling supplies' for its campaign headquarters that year. 'If babies had guns they wouldn't be aborted': Congressman Stockman's bumper sticker prompted immediate outrage. He was selling them to raise money for a campaign that is heavily in debt . The congressman is no stranger to controversy. Earlier this year he boasted on Twitter that he is 'the most conservative Congressman in Texas,' and offered to give an AR-15 rifle to someone who joined his online mailing list. The Stockman campaign also sparked outrage in April with a bumper sticker reading 'If babies had guns they wouldn't be aborted. Vote Pro-Life! The slogan was deemed 'outrageous' by the masses on Twitter. The statement was obviously intended to prompt outrage from critics and serve as a rallying cry from supporters, but a day after posting it to his Twitter feed, it apparently helped fund his campaign war chest for his 2014 re-election bid. He may now be questioning the value of such shock tactics given that his campaign is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.","Campaign was run out of disused motorcycle shop that allowed free use of the building .

"By . James Gordon . A dying man’s wish to see his wife and kids one final time came true thanks to the generosity and hard work of a hospice in Pittsburgh. Charlton Fisher, who is from Jamaica originally, left his family behind and came to the United States, so he could earn money for his oldest daughter to go to nursing school. He worked as a maintenance man at a pair of hotels in Bentleyville, Pensyvlannia to earn enough money to put his daughters through college. Last wishes:Charlton Fisher's (right) dying wish was to see his wife and kids one more time. Thanks to the generosity of Pittsburghers that wish has now come true. His wife Marion, and daughter Ashley, 11 were flown in from Jamaica to see him . Change of heart: n the past three weeks, Charlton Fisher went from wanting to die to wanting desperately to live . We are family: Mrs. Fisher and her daughters including 11-year-old Ashley (pictured), girls arrived at Forbes hospice in Pittsburgh on Saturday night and have been there ever since . However, the 43-year-old is currently holed up at Forbes Hospice at West Penn Hospital because his heart is about to fail. He began to have heart problems in 2012 while living in New York. In December 2012, he had to have heart surgery and he received a pacemaker. While in Bentleyville, he traveled to New York for checkups, but he never complained or let on that anything was wrong. One day in December, Mr. Fisher pulled his manager aside and asked for a ride to the hospital. His pacemaker had been jolting him as his heart function deteriorated. With his pacemaker barely working he wound up in the hospital, and then was moved to hospice when things got worse. He says he couldn’t get up out of bed or even see. Happy times: Back in Jamaica, Vharlton Fisher is seen with his daughters, Ashley, 11, and Asha-Kay, 3. he moved to the U.S. to earn money so they could have a better life back home and go to college . Together again: The family's visit from Jamaica has revived Mr. Fisher. Once unable to stand up or talk without sacrificing too much energy, on Sunday he was walking around, slow and weak, but improved . What next? Mr Fisher's mother-in-law lives in New York City, and plans are underway to transport him to a hospice there if he survives long enough . At the present time, he needs a heart transplant to survive, which is unlikely. The staff asked him what they could do for him. 'He said ‘I miss my wife and kids so badly,’' said Forbes Hospice Counselor Kevin Henry. His former employer, Tejas Gosai, set up a computer in his hospice room and dialed his wife on Skype. 'Fisher was so happy and he said, 'I'd love to see them one more time before I die,' Mr. Gosai said. Emergency papers were prepared and visas were issued for Mr Fisher’s wife Marion, his 11-year-old daughter Ashley and his 3-year-old daughter Asha-kay. Mr Fisher’s boss at the hotels in Bentleyville, where he worked as a maintenance man, paid for the airfare. On Saturday night, his family arrived to see him. He could barely believe it. 'So, so, so beautiful,' he said of the moment to KDKA. 'I was there waiting and then when the moment came, I couldn’t believe my eyes!' 'Till death do us part: Mr Fisher's wife Marion was so happy to see him. She intends to stay by her husband's side until the end . Emotional: Mr Fisher began to cry as he spoke about his family back home and how his one wish was to see them a final time . Sacrifice: Mr. Fisher came to the U.S. from his native Jamaica for work and ended up in Pennsylvania in February 2013, working as a maintenance man at a pair of hotels in Bentleyville. He did it to earn enough money to put his daughters through college . He started to cry when his wife talked about what it meant to her, and how she felt alone so far away in Jamaica. Now they’re together. 'She stayed by me. She hasn’t left,' he said. Family, it seems, may be the best medicine. Since he arrived, he’s been walking, and he says his vision has improved. His will to live also appears to have strengthened. 'I don't have a medical explanation,' said Randy Hebert, medical director at Forbes, to the Post Gazette. 'I've been doing hospice medicine for six years and this is the second time I've seen this,' he said. 'I don’t want to die yet, because I haven’t fulfilled my promise to my daughter,' said Mr Fisher. 'I don't want to die and leave my kids. I want to live some more. I want to live 10, 20 more years.' To survive, Mr. Fisher would need a heart transplant, and it doesn't appear likely that it will happen. Although Mr. Gosai has arranged for the family to stay at one of his other hotels in Monroeville, Mrs. Fisher said she's not leaving her husband's side. He’s not well enough to fly, so he’ll be driven to New York City to stay with his mother-in-law. Again, his boss will pick up the tab. He is hoping to get a new heartHis boss will pay for that as well, for which Fisher is extremely grateful. He still hopes to get a new heart, but in the meantime having his family close by is enough to make his current one beat a little faster.","Carlton Fisher, 43, needs a new heart and is in a hospice in Pittsburgh .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and James Gordon . The five-month-old baby revived on the side of a Florida highway last month after he stopped breathing while in the car with his aunt had problems with his trachea, his family revealed at a news conference Wednesday. The baby, Sebastián de la Cruz, returned home on Friday after spending more than a week in the hospital after his aunt, Pamela Rauseo, stopped on the side of busy State Route 836 to give little Sebastian mouth-to-mouth after she noticed him turning blue. Doctors later detected - and removed - three cysts from the boy's trachea that were making it difficult for him to breathe, his parents told reporters. Miracle: Baby Sebastian with his mother Paola Vargas (center), father Joel de la Cruz and the aunt who saved his life, Pamela Rauseo . Cysts: The boy's family revealed that three cysts were removed from his trachea, which doctors say may have caused him to stop breathing . Rauseo told reporters that the international attention the story received has been a bit hard to handle. 'We didn’t know how to handle all this, . and it was uncomfortable for me,' Rauseo said at a press conference Wednesday at the Hachar . Law Firm in Miami Lakes. 'The truth is that it got out of our control.' Rauseo, 37, was driving on one of the busiest highways in Miami after taking Sebastian to the hospital for some tests. The newborn was born prematurely and suffers with respiratory issues and had recently had some congestion. His aunt, who regularly looks after him whilst his mother is at work, was taking the him back home when suddenly everything in the car fell silent. Saved: Beautiful baby boy Sebastian de la Cruz who lost consciousness on a busy Miami highway on Thursday is being cradled by his mom Paola Vargas, who works as a nurse at the hospital where he was taken . Baby Sebastian, pictured with his parents, was born prematurely last year with respiratory problems . Little Sebastian after the harrowing ordeal on Thursday afternoon along the Dolphin Expressway in Miami, Florida . When Sebastian stopped crying and fell quiet in the back of the car, his aunt Pamela Rauseo knew something was wrong . 'I was driving along the 836 Dolphin Expressway and he was crying. He's always crying. Even when the car is moving, he's constantly crying,' said Ms Rauseo, speaking to the MailOnline. 'We had come to a stop as we were stuck in traffic when suddenly the crying stopped. Everything was dead quiet. I knew something was wrong immediately.' Struck by panic, Ms Rauseo made the decision to pull over and to find out what was wrong. Adding to the drama, she was unable to see the little boy either by turning around or in her rear-view mirror because his car seat was facing away from her. 'He was in the rear of the car but I couldn't even check to see if he was still breathing,' she recalled. Ms Rauseo pulled over in the fast lane of the highway, placed the car in park and raced around to open the back door. Mommy's boy: Sebastian de la Cruz was born prematurely.

Emergency: Pamela Rauseo performs CPR on her baby nephew after he stopped breathing in her car . When she got round to the back of the car, her instinct proved to be correct. Sebastian had lost his pinkish glow and was slowly turning blue. 'He had lost all color and was limp. Completely limp! It was frightening.' She . took the car seat out and placed in on the ground by the side of the . vehicle whilst she began to perform CPR on the child, realising how delicate . her motions would have to be given how very young the baby was. 'I don't know how I remembered what to do. I just knew I couldn't let him die!' 'I . began to shout for help,' Ms Rauseo said. 'I screamed for people to . come over and help but not many people knew how to give CPR to a . five-month-old.' With traffic at a standstill, fellow drivers began to help. A police officer and two firefighters who were stuck in traffic rushed to her aid. Rescue team: Police officer Amauris Bastidas, left, and two emergency workers lean in as the baby starts to breathe .

Another driver, Lucila Godoy left her own son in the car to assist in CPR and comfort Rauseo. By sheer coincidence, an award-winning photographer for the Miami Herald newspaper was passing by and captured a series of dramatic pictures showing the emergency crews saving the baby's life. He said that he heard a woman screaming that the baby couldn't breathe. Al Diaz placed a  call 911 and a team of paramedics raced to the scene. Mr . Diaz was able to capture some stunning images that capture the drama . and tension of the entire scene that happened at the side of the . eight-lane highway. Shortly . after the call was made, police Officer Amauris Bastidas arrived, . helping as Ms Rauseo twice got the baby breathing again. 'He started breathing and crying. Then he started not breathing again,' Bastidas said. Hero: Aunt Pamela Rauseo, 37, was in the car when her baby nephew stopped breathing and she had to pull over to the side of the road . Lucky man: If it wasn't for the quick think-thinking actions of Pamela Rauseo, the lovely little lad might have breathed his last . In safe hands: A paramedic carries Sebastian into an emergency vehicle so he can be taken to hospital . Just as the baby started to catch his breath, more help arrived after Anthony Trim and Alvaro Tonanez from Miami-Dade Fire Rescue heard the emergency call while stuck in traffic. The rescue workers were able to keep Sebastian breathing until paramedics arrived at which point the professionals were able to take over. Ms Rauseo knows just how incredibly lucky she was to have had strangers help save her nephews' life. Baby . Sebastian is now back in hospital where he is undergoing further tests. His mother, Paola Vargas, is a registered nurse and is desperate to . understand how and why her son stopped breathing. Sebastian was photographed later that day in his mother's arms, smiling, the color having returned to his face. Ms . Rauseo works is an interior designer and runs Round321, a company . dedicated to designing innovative and unique pieces for parents and . children.

"By . James Gordon . Straphangers who are late for work or school can get an 'excuse note' from the New York City subway explaining to their boss or teacher the reason for their late arrival. The wintry weather often leads to delays on the roads and rails leading to frayed nerves of both workers and their superiors. Those delayed through no fault of their own can file an online delay verification form, akin to a transit doctor's note. Train traffic ahead: New York's MTA which runs the city subway is providing commuters with 'late notes' they can give to their bosses if their train is delayed on the way to work . The transit agency will write back in about three weeks or so with a note detailing whether a delay occurred on a specific line at a particular time. Its usage has steadily increased with around 6,000 requests each month. Tardy individuals can also write or phone in their delays as well. The online form allows riders to get information on delays that happened within the past 90 days. If the delay dates back further than 90 days, a rider will have to submit a Freedom of Information Law request. Excuse express: Commuters can now get excuse notes for their bosses over e-mail if subway delays make them late for work . 'Those people who are more computer savvy or are more prone to use a computer are finding that it's a service that's easier to use and it's also quicker,' said Paul Fleuranges, the agency’s director of corporate communications told the New York Times. 'We’d rather be at 100 percent on-time performance. But, nobody’s perfect.' Subway trains make about 8,000 trips during an average weekday, with close to 600 trains in operation during the height of the rush hour. NYC Transit officials say track work, mechanical problems, sick customers and police investigations inevitably hold up trains during the course of an average working day. A version of the system has existed for decades but the number of requests has tripled since the MTA's system went online. The agency has written out more than 250,000 notes since the service first began in June of 2010. Passengers need only provide their subway line, times and locations of entering and exiting the train and the MTA will issue a response. What's your excuse? The MTA will give customers a ¿late pass¿ if their train was delayed . 'There was a disruption in service, specifically signal trouble, sick customer, brakes in emergency and track circuit failure, which caused massive service delays, reroutes and/or trains to be discharged on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, A, B, C, D, F, J, L, M, N, Q and R lines,' one recent response read, in part. 'As a result, any one delay lasted up to 82 minutes.' Marcus Greer, who travels from South Jamaica, Queens, to his job as a security guard in Midtown told the Times that the service had helped keep punctuality-related blemishes off his permanent file. Workers who accrue too many can be fired, he said. 'Before the system was in place, they would give you a write-up right off the bat,” he said. “Even if you were late by the train, it just goes in your folder.' In another instance, Tom Weppler, 48, an IT engineer asked for a delay verification in October 2012 after showing up to work an hour late. Delayed arrival: Wintry weather often leads to more delays on the city's transit system. Despite setting off early to work, commuters can be delayed. The MTA now provides letters explaining why passengers were late . A day later, Mr. Weppler was train trouble had affected 16 subway lines. 'As a result,' the authority’s response read, 'any one delay lasted up to 395 minutes,' or 6 hours 35 minutes. 'I could have gone to see a really long movie and had lunch if I’d known I was going to be excused for that long,' he said. Smaller holdup are not recorded however. The MTA says it considers any train that reached its destination 'no more than five minutes late' to be on time. In October commuters took more than 165 million trips and the authority responded to more than 8,200 late note requests, according to preliminary agency data. A staff of eight fields the delay letter requests as well as all other complaints related to service issues. The letters, printed on NYC Transit letterhead, generally describe the maximum delay a certain line experienced during certain hours in the morning. It takes about five days to respond to an online request and up to three weeks for the delayed-excuse note to be written, by which time of course, your boss may very well have forgotten you were ever late in the first place.","Passengers can request a letter excusing their tardiness up to three months after the delay .

"By . James Gordon . The Antiques Roadshow has been mining Idaho - nicknamed The Gem State, for hidden treasures and found one gentleman who had an Edward Hopper etching hanging on his wall worth $250,000. Host Mark L. Walberg and appraiser Gary Piattoni headed to the Old Idaho State Penitentiary and came across one Boise man who had inherited the 1922 etching entitled The Cat Boat from his grandfather. The unnamed owner explained how the print that had been in his family for many years, came into his possession. Cash on the wall: One hopeful man from Boisie Idahoo took an etching he had inherited from his grandfather to the Antiques Roadshow. Much to his surprise he found out it was valued at $250,000 . The Cat Boat: A 1922 Edward Hopper Etching was appraised for $250,000 at the Antiques Roadshow in Boise, Idaho . 'I acquired it though inheritance. My grandfather was a member of the New York Society Of Etchers and began a collection at that time that I inherited.' The owner explained that the item was one of a number of things that he grew up around, but only recently had its value explained to him. 'I liked it over a long period of time. I liked it irrespective of its value.Someone took me aside and said I think that a famous artists that did that!' the owner said. His friends' suspicion was confirmed. 'You have an etching by the artist Edward Hopper, a very famous American painter and printmaker,' said Todd Weyman, the show's appraiser. How much do you think it's worth? Antiques Roadshow's Todd Weyman (right) valued the etching at $250,000 . Edward Hopper (1882-1967): As an artist he was known for scenes of contemporary American life, including the famous painting of people in a diner, 'Nighthawks' and latterly his etchings . Edward Hopper was a prominent American realist painter and printmaker. While he was most well known for his oil paintings, he was an exceptionally proficient watercolorist and printmaker in etching. When Hopper turned to etching's he produced approximately 70 works, many of urban scenes of both Paris and New York. Many people know his work through his paintings of solitary people in various scenes around New York, such as eating in diners or being alone at night. His work has been the subject of blockbuster solo exhibitions at museums. It wasn't until the early 1920s his etchings began to receive public recognition. The program's appraiser, Mr Weyman told the owner that it was a beautiful etching and noticed Hopper's signature at the bottom. 'He printed his etchings in very small editions,' he said. 'There are probably fewer than 25 of these in existence.' 'You  have a top print by an extremely important American artist from the most important decade of his career.' Style: Hopper used to use very white paper and dark black inks to bring out the color and shadings perfectly . Shocked: The owner cannot believe how much the etching is worth upon hearing the valuation . Sticker shock: The etching had been given to this man by his grandfather who was a member of the New York Etchings Society . Not wanting to be drawn on estimating the value of the etching, the owner kept quiet. Mr Weyman continued, 'I would suggest you insure it to the value of $250,000.' 'Really!' exclaimed the owner, clearly shocked yet delighted at his valuation. 'That's more money than belongs in my living room!' 'It's a real masterpiece and you're lucky to have it,' said Antiques Roadshow's Mr Weyman, who had struggled throughout to contain his excitement at being presented with such a piece. The picture is now going back on the Boise living room wall where it has hung for many years. You can view an exhibition of Hopper's work at the Dallas Museum of Art through February. Signature work: The work was personally signed by Edward Hopper and it even appears as though the artist rubbed out his first attempt before rewriting it .","Man obtained the painting through his grandfather and put it on his wall .

"By . James Gordon . If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. But such sound advice escaped many people who were captivated by the idea that a machine could really turn water into wine in just three days. Turns out, such ideas are best left to the pages of The Bible when Jesus managed to do it with just the wave of his hand. The Miracle Machine was a fake. However, the publicity stunt was for a good cause. An organization called Wine To Water says it provides people around the world with access to clean water. Scroll down for video... Remember this? The Miracle Machine that can make wine with water on your kitchen counter for $499 was a hoax . Coming clean: Kevin Boyer and Philip James, the people behind the Miracle Machine hoax have explained that their device was made up and designed to generate interest in their charity winetowater.org . The charity have apologized on their website but hope that their stunt has drawn attention to their cause. 'The Miracle Machine . has generated enormous interest around the globe. We and supporters . Kevin Boyer and Philip James are sorry to disappoint anyone who was . looking forward to high quality wine in 3 days.' 'For . the cost of a bottle of fine wine, we provide a way to produce 99.9% . pure drinking water to a family for up to five years and THAT is the . true miracle,' charity founder Doc Hendley said. If . the aim was to generate interest for the organization, the trick worked . as the phony miracle wine maker generated some 6,000 tweets with 7,000 . people signing up to learn more about what would have been a . revolutionary invention. 'One in eight people on the planet don't have the simple miracle of drinking clean water,' said Allen Peterson, CEO of Wine To Water. 'If we save one life because of the campaign, it has been worth it.' Elaborate hoax: The creators of the hoax came up with a complex process as to how the machine would work . The organization did their level best . to make the item appear genuine stating that it was developed by wine . experts in California and capable of make different types and styles of . wine, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Potential users were told that they could track the progress of their wine using a free smartphone app. The rest of us should have known that the people behind the fictional object were trying to blind the rest of the world with science. Their nonsensical description of how the machine operates is now comical when read in hindsight. 'A . digital ‘refractometer measures the sugar content of the liquid during . the fermentation process, while an air-diffuser passes filtered air . through a so-called ‘micro-oxygenated’ channel.

The machine also has an ultrasonic transducer under the chamber that can speed up the flavor and development of the wine. Just . like the miracle from Biblical times, it literally turns water into wine, with just . the addition of a few ingredients in a fraction of the time and cost it . would normally take,‘ explained the 'CEO' Kevin Boyer. The campaign was thought up by public relations group MSL. Kevin .

'I would do it 100 . times over again,' Boyer told the Los Angeles Times. 'Not the misleading . and purposely being facetious, but if it saves one extra life, I'd do . it again.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Distress: Janet Milliken was left 'disturbed' after learning her home was the site of a murder-suicide . A woman has appealed to the state Supreme Court after a home seller and real estate agent allegedly failed to tell her a murder-suicide had taken place in the home they sold her. When Janet Milliken, 59, moved from California to Thornton, Pennsylvania in 2007, she was unaware that the new house she had bought for $610,000 had been the site of two deaths a year earlier. Only when she moved in and began chatting to the neighbours did she learn of her new home's grisly past - and the discovery left her disturbed, according to the lawsuit. She sued the sellers, Joseph and Kathleen Jacono,  and the real estate agent, Re/Max, for fraud and misrepresentation, claiming they deliberately hid what had occurred at the home. But the trial judge ruled in favour . of the defendants, saying state law does not require agents to disclose . such facts, ABC News reported. Last month, the state appeals court agreed with the . decision. According to the . opinion penned by President Judge Emeritus Kate Ford Elliot, sellers are . only required to identify structural, hazardous and legal impairments . to a property. The opinion . noted the Jaconos and their Realtors sought advice from the Pennsylvania . Real Estate Commission and were told they did not need to disclose the . murder-suicide. 'If . psychological defects must be disclosed, then we are not far from . requiring sellers to reveal that a next-door neighbor is loud and . obnoxious, or on some days you can smell a nearby sewage plant, or that . the house was built on an old Indian burial ground,' the opinion said. Scene: The Thornton, Pennsylvania home where a man shot his wife before turning the gun on himself . Now Milliken has filed a petition to the Supreme Court of . Pennsylvania to continue her battle. Her . attorney Tim Rayne told ABC News that they want to make the state . realise 'that having a horrific event occur within a property can be . just as damaging and troubling to a future homeowner as a physical . defect, or perhaps even more so.' He added: 'Having a gunshot . murder-suicide committed within the home is much more devastating than . having a small leak concealed by the previous homeowner. 'Physical defects can be fixed. Troubling events that could and did . occur in this home could never go away.' The battle stems from February 11, 2006, when Konstantinos Koumboulis shot and killed his wife, then shot himself dead in the master bedroom of the Pickering Trail home, which they owned. Their three young children were at home at the time, but were not harmed. On February 11, 2006, 50-year-old Konstantinos Koumboulis shot and killed his 34-year-old wife, Georgia. He then turned the gun on himself and shot himself dead in the master bedroom of the home, which they owned. Their three children, aged seven to 13, were at home at the time, but were not harmed. Police said the eldest child called 911 and the bodies were found around 8.30 a.m. After authorities arrived on the scene, the children were taken to state police barracks, where they were met by family. Their home went to auction. Eight months later the Jaconos, who knew about the killings, bought the home for $450,000 and later sold it to Milliken. She moved in with her two teenage children after her husband's death. Rayne said Milliken, 59, was 'disturbed' when she found out the history of the home. As she wondered how to tell her children, they learned of the deaths from their friends. 'They were very upset upon learning about it and disturbed about the whole situation,' Rayne said. 'They were dealing with the death of a . father and husband and wanted to move closer to family, and then this . happened to them. It was a tragedy all around.' The family is still living at the home as they cannot afford to move out. If they were to leave, they would have to tell the new buyers about the home's history 'through good conscience', which would affect the value, Rayne said. As . he dissented to December's Superior Court decision, Judge John T. Bender acknowledged the massive loss the family had suffered. 'The financial . penalty Mrs. Milliken has suffered was entirely avoidable had the . sellers whom she bought her home merely exercised a little more . integrity and a little less greed,' he said. But Abraham Reich, the attorney for the Jaconos, said: 'The majority, en banc [full-court] opinion of the Superior Court was well reasoned and consistent with years of industry practice in Pennsylvania.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Elephants are craftier than we imagined - and carry out raids on crops when the nights are at their darkest. Scientists found that their foraging expeditions in Africa tend to vary with the lunar cycle. They found that fewer raids took place during a full moon - when farmers are more likely to spot the animals plundering their crops. Researchers found that African elephants picked the darkest nights to raid crop fields . The amount of crop damage also fell during the full moon phase, the research in and around Tanzania’s Mikumi National Park revealed. Five villages on the park’s northern boundary were selected for the British research, which recorded examples of elephants plundering crops being grown close to and within human settlements. Co-author of the study Dr Rachel Grant, lecturer in animal behaviour at Anglia Ruskin University, said: ‘Our results support the belief that elephants alter their behaviour to reduce the risks of encountering humans.’ She said the fact they raid crops ‘almost exclusively’ at night indicates they only go near villages when they feel they are harder to discover. Dr Grant said: ‘An elephant’s awareness of the higher risk of being detected on moonlit nights, because of the visual advantage gained by humans, could account for the changes in their behaviour during the lunar cycle and explain why elephants are less likely to venture close to villages during the full moon. The amount of crop damage also fell during the full moon phase, the research in and around Tanzania's Mikumi National Park revealed . ‘Some animals that vary their activity according to the lunar cycle have an internally arising biological rhythm; alternatively they may be basing their decision making on local conditions at the time. ‘Many animals alter their behaviour according to varying light levels and the perceived risk of predation, and this is likely to be a partly evolved, partly learned response.’ The research, published in the African Journal of Ecology, could be used to help protect farms from damage by elephants.","British researchers observed groups in Tanzania's Mikumi National Park .

"By . James Gordon . A father from Southern California is fighting for the right to adopt his own son who was apparently secretly put up for adoption by the baby's mother. Preston King, 19, says his constitutional rights were taken away from him when his ex-girlfriend, and mother to his child, decided she could no longer support raising a child on her own. Advocates that support his cause have launched a Facebook page and website to try and garner support for and persuade lawmakers to give him the chance to be the father he believes he deserves. Scroll down for video... Short and sweet: On the day baby Wyatt was born, he was only allowed to spend fifteen minutes with the newborn before he was handed over to his adoptive parents . Bring Wyatt Home: Preston King says he had his son given away for adoption without his consent. He is currently fighting for his rights to his own child . Writing on his Facebook page, Mr King says he loved the baby's mom 'as much as a 18 year old in high school could', but no matter how much effort he put into the relationship, things didn't work out. When he was told that he was going to become a daddy for the first time, he says he took the responsibility of his impending fatherhood seriously and took on a second job, . He maintains he attended every doctors appointment and even though things were not always easy with his then girlfriend, he bought her clothes for her ever-expanding belly. He wanted the baby's mom to be as calm and relaxed as possible. Mr King says he pampered her as much as money would allow with mani pedi's, nice dinners, day trips and overnight trips to the beach. As the relationship began to fall, Mr King decided to move out on his own and rented an apartment for his ex and future baby a month before graduating high school. Miscarriage of justice: The judge in Preston's case determined that because he was not married to the mother he was not considered the presumed father . Hello and goodbye: Preston breaks down in tears on the day of Wyatt's birth as he realise he has just a few moments left before the newborn is taken away from him . He bought baby furniture and decorative items to make the place feel homely. During the summer he was informed that his ex was planning to give their baby away at birth for adoption with or without his consent. He was even contacted by someone at an adoption agency via text message trying to coax him into meeting the people she hand selected. Mr King made it clear that he wanted to raise his child to raise as his own and was dead against placing him up for adoption. The morning after he was told the news, Preston headed to the Orange County courthouse to file papers to establish paternity. Daddy's boy: Preston King says the judge in his custody battle did not take into account that he worked two jobs and even rented an apartment for the baby's birth mother and her child . Before the child was born, Mr King claims he went to court several times in order to prevent the baby from going home with adoptive parents. It made no difference. Baby Wyatt was born on September 7, 2013 and was sent home with his adoptive parents. Mr King was denied the opportunity to sign a declaration declaring he was the father and was refused the opportunity of being placed on the birth certificate at the hospital. Given just 15 minutes alone with his son the day he was born, baby Wyatt was handed over to foster parents within hours of the birth. One moment in time: Preston King shares another brief moment with his son, Wyatt. The baby is living with foster parents . The baby's mother did nothing to stop the baby being given away once her mind was made up and claimed that Preston was never there for her emotionally, mentally or financially. Mr King is adamant that he is the biological father and that a DNA test  would confirm it. He has vowed to continue to fight until Wyatt is home in his arms. Supporters of his position saya  father shouldn’t have to fight strangers in court for the right to parent his own child. An online petition has been set up to push for a change in California state law to prevent so-called 'unethical' adoptions from taking place in the future.","Preston King had his son given away for adoption without his consent .

"By . James Gordon . The star of ABC's The Bachelor has sparked widespread outrage by calling gay people perverted and saying they should not be allowed on the hit reality show. Juan Pablo Galavis, 32, was asked about his views on having a bisexual or gay version of the popular program when he candidly declared that a homosexual version of The Bachelor would not be a good idea. TV bosses have been quick to respond calling his comments 'careless, thoughtless and insensitive'. Scroll down to listen to the interview... On the record: Juan Pablo Galavis, the 32-year-old star of The Bachelor who also appeared on the most recent season of The Bachelorette, made the remarks in an interview . Strange views: ABC's latest Bachelor says he doesn't think that there should be a gay or bisexual on the broadcast reality television show and described gays as 'more pervert in a sense' At . a 'network party' on Friday night in Pasadena, California, Mr . Galavis was asked for his thoughts on allowing gay people onto the show. Mr . Galavis, reportedly told The TV Page's Sean Daly in a radio interview: 'No... I respect . [gay people] but, honestly, I don't think it's a good example for . kids...' 'Obviously people . have their husband and wife and kids and that is how we are brought up. Now there is fathers having kids and all that, and it is hard for me to . understand that too in the sense of a household having peoples… Two . parents sleeping in the same bed and the kid going into bed… It is . confusing in a sense.' The off-color remarks made by Mr Galavis, who is the show's first Latino . bachelor, didn't end there as he continued airing his conservative . views. 'There's this thing about gay people... it seems to me, and . I don't know if I'm mistaken or not... but they're more 'pervert' in a . sense. And to me the show would be too strong... too hard to watch.' Outnumbered: Juan Pablo Galavis is the first Hispanic to lead the love charge on The Bachelor, but he doesn't feel the show has room for gays . The . single dad, who has been known to duck out of dates to spend time with . his four-year-old daughter Camila, attempted to justify his comments by . stating that he has many gay friends and co-workers. In the run-up to this season's The . Bachelor, fans of Juan Pablo Galavis were calling him . 'Juan-in-a-million' and 'Juan-derful. They may now be questioning their . judgement. Galavis' legions of fans pushed back against the avalanche of criticism, accusing his detractors of misinterpreting the reality star's comments and censuring him for merely expressing his personal views. Damian Holbrook, senior writer for TV Guide Magazine who happens to be gay, came to Galavis' defense Saturday afternoon, posting a photo of himself in the company of the hunky 32-year-old. '@JuanPaGalavis groped me last night. He does NOT have a problem with gays, Holbrook wrote in the message, which Galavis himself later retweeted to his 219,300 followers. ABC, Warner Horizon and The Bachelor executive producers issued a statement on Saturday afternoon slamming Mr Galavis’ statements. 'Juan Pablo’s comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show’s producers or studio,' the statement read. Apology: Pablo Galavis has said sorry to anyone that he has offended. 'If you listen to the entire interview, there's nothing but respect for Gay people and their families' he says . Some of my best friends are gay: Galavis was asked whether ABC should have a gay or bisexual bachelor on the show. 'No,' Pablo Galavis responded. 'I don't think it's a good example for kids to watch that on TV. It's hard, it's hard, it's a very thin line.' Response: ABC, Warner Horizon and The Bachelor executive producers just issued a statement slamming Bachelor star Juan Pablo Galavis¿ statements. They say his comments were 'careless, thoughtless and insensitive' The insensitive comments come just as ABC appears to be throwing it weight behind Mr Galavis and the long-running television show. He is one the networks' most popular stars in some time having reinvigorated the Bachelor franchise, now in its 18th season. Supporter: Damian Holbrook, senior writer for TV Guide Magazine who happens to be gay, came to Galavis' defense, posting this photo of himself in the company of the hunky 32-year-old . ABC . has even been airing Bachelor specials in addition to the regular . episodes with the channel added two more hours of The Bachelor a week to . take advantage of promising viewing figures that have been generated so . far this season. Pablo Galavis has released a statement on his Facebook page saying the interview takes his remarks out of context. 'I want to apologize to all the people I may have offended because of my comments on having a Gay or Bisexual Bachelor. The . comment was taken out of context. If you listen to the entire . interview, there's nothing but respect for Gay people and their . families. I have many gay friends and one of my closest friends who's . like a brother has been a constant in my life especially during the past . 5 months. The word pervert . was not what I meant to say and I am very sorry about it. Everyone . knows English is my second language and my vocabulary is not as broad as . it is in Spanish and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words . to express myself. What . I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense . and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept. The . show is very racy as it is and I don't let my five-year-old daughter . watch it. Once again, I'm sorry for how my words were taken. I would . never disrespect anyone.' Outspoken: The Venezuelan former footballer said he felt that gay people were more 'pevert' Impressionable: It makes one wonder whether the 32-year-old reality star is teaching this 'culture' to his four-year-old daughter Camila with ex-girlfriend, Carla Rodriguez . On . Facebook, Galavis’ mea culpa has received a mixed response, with some . of his supporters blaming the media for stirring up controversy. Most commenters, however, blasted Galavis for his perceived bigotry and homophobia. 'What . a jerk you are,' one Michael Shockley wrote on Galavis' Facebook page. 'The bachelor makes a joke out of love and marriage in the first place. I . think it is confusing for a kid to see the bachelor.' User Sean . Riley called out the single father as a hypocrite who espouses . traditional family values while dating 20 women at once on TV ‘for . money.’ In a brutal takedown of Galavis, The Salt Lake Tribune TV . critic Scott D. Pierce went even farther, calling the Bachelor 'a big, . stinkin' homophobe' and a 'narrow-minded bigot.' Pierce also took . issue with Galavis' apology, in which he insisted that he does not hold . homophobic views because he has many gay friends. ' 'Which is sort of like a racial bigot insisting that he has black friends,' Pierce wrote. Mixed messages: Facebook user Sean Riley posted this graphic calling out the single father as a hypocrite who espouses traditional family values while dating 20 women at once on TV 'for money' Pierce . reported that in an amusing twist, on the day of the fateful party in . Pasadena, TV critics staying at the Langham Hotel had roses delivered to . their rooms with an attached card that read: 'Will you accept this . rose? - Juan Pablo.' 'It was delivered to both the female and male critics,' Pierce wrote. 'Galavis must be horrified.' As a single father, Juan Pablo is . looking for not just someone to be his wife, but also someone to be a . mother to his daughter Camila. He explained: ‘I'm going to find hopefully the person who is going to join me and my daughter. That's what I'm looking for.’ Juan Pablo quickly became a fan favorite thanks during last years The Bachelorette to his clear devotion to his four-year-old . 'It's . a great responsibility because I am going to find hopefully the person . who is going to be with me and my daughter,' he said. Critics wasted no time drawing comparisons between Galavis, the suave serial dater, to Phil Robertson, the rugged star of the popular A&E show Duck Dynasty. The bearded patriarch of the Robertson clan from Louisiana caused a monumental uproar when he equated homosexuals with terrorists, prostitutes and people who engage in bestiality in an interview with GQ magazine for the January issue. Following a brief suspension, Phil was reinstated on the show just in time for the premiere of season 5 this week. However, Mr Robertson’s anti-gay remarks may have done their damage, as the hit show, once considered the single most popular reality program on TV, had a 28 per cent drop in ratings compared to the debut of season 4 last year.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . A British company is opening a gay retirement village in the south of France – leaving the region’s mayor ‘flabbergasted’. Yves Bastie gave planning permission for the building of 107 eco-friendly homes at Salleles-d’Aude earlier this year. But he has only just discovered that the development near Perpignan will be France’s first ‘rainbow’ retirement centre. Village Group, have made it clear that gay people will be particularly welcome at 'Le Village - Canal du Midi' In France it is against the law for homes to be marketed solely at a specific sexual orientation . And it is hardly surprising – the developers admitted they made the decision on Monday as an experiment, because they were on the verge of closing the project down completely. In France it is against the law for homes to be marketed solely at a specific sexual orientation. But the developers, Village Group, have made it clear that gay people will be particularly welcome. Mr Bastie said when he was asked for approval he was shown pictures of heterosexual couples at another Village Group project designed for ‘over 50s seeking a healthy lifestyle’. He said he had no idea that the company would be aiming the development – called ‘Le Village - Canal du Midi’ and worth more than £20million –  predominantly at the gay community. The starting price for the houses 'which are not yet built 'is £206,000, with service charges of around £60 a week . Promotion: The community's website says it is intended for 'the +50s Gay & Lesbian (lgbt) Community' ‘I’m flabbergasted,’ said Mr Bastie.  ‘I had absolutely no idea about this. What will be the effect on the image of the town?’ Gay marriage was legalised in France in May, but there have been mass demonstrations against the move. Conservative groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, have called for an end to the promotion of homosexual lifestyles. The online brochure for ‘Le Village’  displays a picture of the Canal du Midi with a rainbow flag – the symbol of ‘gay liberation’. Its website describes the development as: ‘A private oasis for the +50s Gay and Lesbian Community who want an “Active and Healthy Lifestyle” in the warm, friendly and healthy climate of Southern France.’ The starting price for the houses – which are not yet built – is £206,000, with service charges of around £60 a week. Location: The development will be located near Perpignan in the south of France . Danny Silver, managing director of Villages Group, admitted he only had the idea about marketing the village to the gay community on Monday. He said: ‘The real estate market in France is so bad right now, and getting the planning permission took such a long time, that we were on the verge of closing the project down completely. ‘We didn’t have any takers, and when we had the idea of marketing it in this way, we thought, “Why not?” It was an experiment, the last toss of the coin.’ Mr Silver said the online brochure was changed on Monday. Since then interest has amounted to ‘thousands of emails every hour’. I’ve been 40 years in this business and I’ve never seen anything like it,’ he said. But he stressed heterosexuals would still be welcome in the village.",Village near Perpignan will be France's first 'rainbow' retirement centre .

The Vatican said more than three million people were on hand for the Mass, based on information from World Youth Day organisers and local authorities. Not all of them were paying attention to the Mass: children posed for random photos with people holding flags, snoozed and packed up their makeshift camps. Finding food was a core concern, with long lines of bedraggled pilgrims snaking out of cafes and ice cream vendors mobbed by youths starved for breakfast. The presidents of Brazil, Francis' native Argentina, Bolivia and Suriname were on hand for the Mass, as were the vice presidents of Uruguay and Panama.

Many of those at the vigil had tears in their eyes as they listened to Francis’ call for them to not be 'part-time Christians' and to build up their church like his namesake, St. Francis of Assisi, was called to do. 'Jesus offers us something bigger than the World Cup!' Francis said, drawing cheers from the crowd in this football-mad nation. He urged young Catholics to go out and spread their faith 'to the fringes of society, even to those who seem farthest away, most indifferent.' 'The church needs you, your enthusiasm, your creativity and the joy that is so characteristic of you!' he said to applause. The Pope was set to return to Rome tonight after a week-long trip, once he had met the bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean and held a thank-you audience with some of the 60,000 volunteers who organised the youth festival. 'It was such an excellent week, everybody was in such good spirit, you could just feel a sense of peace,' said Denise da Silva, a Rio de Janeiro Catholic who was sitting alone on the beach Sunday morning, a Brazilian flag painted on her face. Incredible sight: A man reaches out of the window of a glass-fronted hotel to take a photo of the millions of Catholics gathered to see Pope Francis's final mass of trip to Brazil . A series of giant screens allowed the throng, many of whom had camped overnight, to see the distant Pope Francis up close .

Popeacabana: The millions of worshippers turned out to welcome the first Latin American pontiff home on his first overseas trip as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church . 'I have never seen something here in Rio so marvelous as what we have just lived.' According to census data, the number of Catholics in Brazil dipped from 125million in 2000 to 123million in 2010, with the church’s share of the total population dropping from 74 per cent to 65 per cent. During the same time period, the number of evangelical Protestants and Pentecostals skyrocketed from 26million to 42million, increasing from 15 per cent to 22 per cent of the population in 2010. The Rev. Jean-Luc Zadroga, a Benedictine monk who was leading a group of 14 students from a Catholic university in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, said it was clear Francis had connected with the crowd, particularly the locals. 'He's really trying to reach out to Catholics who have fallen away from the church or disappointed with the church and I think it's working,' he said.","Pilgrims cheer the Pope's call for them to get out in the streets to build up the Catholic church .

"By . Emily Davies . The widow of a fusilier shot dead on a training exercise has told of her disgust after it emerged the soldiers who killed her husband will be released from prison today and be allowed to rejoin the army. Newlywed James Wilkinson, 21, was killed by machine gun fire during a mock battle in training with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in Kenya in 2011. Last summer Corporal Colin Bell, 30, and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price, 43, were given sentences of 14 months and 21 months respectively at a court martial for negligently performing a duty. Distraught: Sarah Wilkinson has blasted the appeals granted for the servicemen that shot her husband James in mock battle in Kenya in 2011 . They had been married for four months when Private Wilkinson was killed. Sarah was pregnant with their daughter Annabelle, now aged two. James helped her bring up her first son Connor (all pictured together) Private Wilkinson’s widow, Sarah, spoke of her horror that the two men were yesterday granted appeals against their sentences. Their orders barring them from the army were quashed and the judge reduced them both to the rank of private. Mrs . Wilkinson, 23, said: ‘I’m absolutely shocked and disgusted that the men . responsible for taking my husband’s life are being let back into the . army like they have done no wrong. ‘Their . original sentence was not harsh and if they had any respect for James . or any compassion for my children and I they would have just kept their . heads down and got on with it.’ The couple had been married for four . months when Private Wilkinson was killed and Mrs Wilkinson was pregnant . with their daughter Annabelle, now aged two, at the time. He had helped raise her son Connor, now aged four, from a previous relationship, whom he treated as a son of his own. Private Wilkinson was killed by a machine gun, which went off in the hands of Colin Bell, 30 . Widow Sarah claims Bell and Patrick Price, who was supervising, wouldn't rejoin if they had compassion for her . ‘They didn’t just take one life that day, they took several,’ she said. ‘I will always love James with all my heart and I will never forgive anyone involved for letting him die in vain. 'I hope people question who some of the heroes of our country are. I know I would die before I let my son serve with these irresponsible men.’ Private Wilkinson died when a malfunctioning machine gun accidentally fired. Price supervised the exercise and Bell was holding the weapon when it went off. Mrs Wilkinson criticised the decision to release Bell and Price from prison and to allow them to rejoin the army. She said: 'I will never get over losing my husband. I will never accept that there is no justice' ‘I will never get over losing my husband. I will never accept that there is no justice. I just wish they could accept the consequences of their actions. ‘I want to be honest with my children as they grow up. 'Before at least I could tell them that the men who killed their dad were punished for what they did, but now they have the anguish of knowing the men can continue to represent our country with pride.’ Appeal judge, Lord Justice Pitchford, said reducing their ranks was sufficient but dismissed Price’s appeal against his conviction. ‘While we accept that the consequence of the appellants’ negligence was both extremely serious and tragic, we do not concur in the view that these offences could be regarded as at or near the most serious of their kind,’ he said. ‘In our judgment, theirs was not a reckless disregard for safety but a failure under pressure of circumstances to recognise a danger which, in other circumstances, would have been clear to them.’","James Wilkinson, 21, killed by machine gun fire in mock battle .

"By . Emily Davies . Prince Charles has stopped selling eggs at his farm shop after a fox attack on his hen coop killed 24 of the birds . Prince Charles was left with egg on his face after having to shut down his Close Farm egg business because foxes attacked his chicken coop. A total of 24 hens were slaughtered by foxes, leaving His Royal Highness unable to sell eggs from the farm, near his Highgrove Estate. Some of the birds survived the attack and have since been moved to another premises to keep them safe from being preyed on by foxes. The eggs are usually sold from his farm shop in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, which he owns in addition to others in Windsor, London, Bath. But yesterday customers in Tetbury were greeted with a notice to say: ‘Dear Customers, The fox killed 24 of our chickens now the rest of the surviving chickens have been brought to a more secure location. This will mean no more eggs to sell, sorry, regards.’ Despite the Prince’s passion for organic products, he has had misfortune in recent years with the business side of things. His Duchy Originals brand reported a loss of more than £3.3 million for the 2009 financial year and was taken over by Waitrose in the autumn of that year. Meanwhile the prince’s hopes of resurrecting his Veg Shed home delivery business of his vegetables to the locals in Gloucestershire have been sunk. According to a farm worker, Charles wanted to revive the delivery business last summer, but that never happened and plans have now been permanently abandoned. Prince Charles invested around £100,000 in his organic retail business when he moved it from Highgrove to Close Farm, Tetbury. Last year, Veg Shed shut down after the vegetable business was blighted by the long, cold spring. While some hens did survive the attack, they are now being moved to a safer nesting spot (stock image) The Prince did maintain a roadside, un-staffed shop, with an honesty box for public buyers of a limited range of produce. The Duchy Originals brand after being rescued by a Waitrose takeover now encompasses 230 products, sold in 30 countries, from Japan to America. In partnership with Waitrose since 2009, it boasts annual profits of £2.8 million and has raised £11 million for charitable causes.","Fox attack on Prince Charles's chicken coop kills 24 birds at Close Farm .

"By . Emily Davies . Toys worth thousands of pounds donated to sick children at Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital have been stolen. Gadgets and goods including a Nintendo Wii, iPads, board games, phones, shoes, and cash were taken from Britain’s largest hospital for unwell children. Last year staff made 70 stolen property reports, out of almost 200 theft reports since 2011. Among the items taken by thieves were baby toys and gadgets that children who are bed-ridden could play, including a PSP games console, portable DVD players and a Kindle e-reader. Baby toys were also stolen, as well as a web cam to enable patients to talk to their relatives online. Callous: Toys and gadgets worth thousands have been stolen from children and families at Great Ormond Street Hospital . Important medical equipment was also taken including incubator covers, a microscope adapter, a carer bed and a hospital trolley. Even a baby buggy, therapeutic aids, and nurses’ uniforms were stolen, a Freedom of Information request shows. A spokeswoman for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘Our hospital is a busy public space with hundreds of visitors every day and, like many public areas in London, opportunist thefts of personal items sometimes occur. ‘We work closely with the police to carry out reviews and improve security, and all staff receive training to remind them of the importance of remaining vigilant and ensuring both their own items and those of our patients and families are kept safe and secure. ‘We are also continuing to expand our CCTV network and operate a robust security presence within public areas of the hospital.’ A Nintendo Wii was among the goods taken by thieves at the London-based hospital.

As well as electronic entertainment devices, like this iPad (file picture), important medical equipment was also taken, including incubator covers, a microscope adapter, a carer bed and a hospital trolley . Criminals caused outrage in 2012 when Christmas presents for children in intensive care were stolen. No one was ever caught. In many cases police gave the hospital, in Central London, crime prevention advice and in 15 cases improvements were made to security measures. Great Ormond Street is not the only hospital to be targeted by thieves in recent years. In March a bank card was stolen from a dying man in Blackpool Victoria Hospital. The criminals stole £1,000 and used the card to buy a 32-inch television. In January an elderly patient had her handbag stolen as she lay unconscious in bed at York Hospital. Brenda Scott, 74, was struggling to breathe when her bag containing her purse and jewellery disappeared. In October last year former hospital worker Emma Walker and her husband Paul pleaded guilty to setting up a £30,000 online business selling medical equipment taken from Salford Royal Hospital.","Games consoles, iPads, and even shoes were taken from children's hospital .

"By . Gerri Peev . and Emily Davies . Politicians must pledge that future wars will be short with clear goals that will convince a 'war-weary' public, says Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . Politicians must pledge that future wars will be short with clear goals that will convince a ‘war-weary’ public, says Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. A decade of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to a ‘climate of scepticism’ and an ‘irrational fear’ about military intervention in  broken states, he says. Even the threat of terrorism from volatile foreign countries no longer convinced British people that war was necessary. His comments – made at the weekend during a debate at the Munich Security Conference – came as it emerged that he had urged ministers to lobby unions to back Trident. Mr Hammond fears that Labour will ‘wobble’ over the need for a nuclear deterrent and has called for the unions to press Labour on the threat this would pose to Britain’s shipbuilding industry. But his warning of an ‘irrational’ fear of war among British voters will provoke more controversy. ‘There is a climate of scepticism about engagement in failed or failing countries, a fear of getting entrapped in longer term, deeper forms of engagement,’ he said. ‘Increasingly we need to present intervention as time-limited and with strictly defined ambitions. ‘We are at a point in the UK where there is a war-weariness after ten years of engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan. ‘There is definitely a fear, quite irrational in some cases, that any engagement anywhere will somehow lead to an uncontrollable commitment to large numbers of troops, a large amount of resources and a long-term intervention.’ A decade of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to a 'climate of scepticism' and an 'irrational fear' about military intervention in  broken states, he says . MPs last year rejected David Cameron’s call for military strikes on the Assad regime in Syria in a surprise Commons defeat. Mr Hammond said the public no longer seemed to fear the consequences of the proliferation of chemical weapons. MPs last year rejected David Cameron's call for military strikes on the Assad regime in Syria in a surprise Commons defeat. ‘It is very clear to those of us looking in horror at this emerging situation in Syria that we are creating a new hotbed of international terrorism, a new base from which international terrorism will operate that will probably rival any of those we have seen in the last decade or so,’ he said. ‘We are allowing this to happen and yet public opinion in Western countries is not yet persuaded that military intervention will be justified or in their own self-interest. It will be a long time before anyone forgets the mistakes of Iraq.’ Mr Hammond has also told colleagues of his fears that Labour MPs and peers are putting pressure on party leader Ed Miliband not to back a replacement of Trident. Defence ministers Mark Francois and Lord Astor have been told to lobby Labour’s union supporters within the shipbuilding industry. ‘The Tories don’t want Labour having a wobble on this,’ said a Whitehall source. Labour says Mr Hammond should ‘keep his nose out’ of party affairs and that Mr Miliband is committed to Trident.","Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the public are 'war weary'

"By . Emily Davies . The spa in London's Covent Garden is to close after almost 40 years of business . The luxury spa where Joan Collins once famously cavorted on a pool swing is to close after almost 40 years. The Sanctuary, in London’s Covent Garden, was the setting for an orgy scene in the 1978 erotic movie The Stud, starring Miss Collins and based on the novel by her sister Jackie. It is to shut because its owner is making more money from selling its branded lotions, oils and scrubs than from pampering the well-heeled. The Sanctuary, a favourite among celebrities, was opened by US choreographer Gary Cockerill in 1977 as a present to his ballerina wife. It welcomes around 60,000 guests a year, offering treatments ranging in price between £30 and £330. But PZ Cussons, which now owns the spa, announced yesterday that it would be closing the flagship club to focus on selling its beauty products. Its range has been praised by celebrities such as presenter Holly Willoughby and the ballerina and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell. The announcement comes only six years after Cussons, the makers of Imperial Leather soap, bought the Sanctuary brand. It follows the closure of its smaller day spas in Cambridge, Bristol and Richmond, West London. The group, which had launched the smaller spas following its £75million Sanctuary takeover in 2008, had originally planned to retain the Covent Garden site. But Cussons revealed yesterday that it will close on May 31 with the loss of some 100 jobs. The spa is believed to have been hit by the trend for home pampering as consumers spend less on visits to day spas and instead choose to use DIY treatments at home. That has seen sales of the Sanctuary range – promoted by Miss Bussell – perform well in the first half of the financial year. Scroll down for video . The spa was the setting for an orgy scene in the Joan Collins film The Stud . It made £47.6million for the half-year to November 2013 – a 7.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits – with earnings at its UK and European business up 8.1 per cent at £25.3million. Overall the company saw ‘good progress’ across all four of its UK beauty brands, including St Tropez. Sales of the fake tan lotion did particularly well after Cussons brought in Kate Moss to be the face of the brand. Richard Harvey, chairman of Cussons, said its interim profits came despite a ‘significant’ currency hit from emerging markets. The spa has been a favourite among London celebrities and socialites since its opening in 1977 . It is being sold so the company may be able to focus more on its beauty products which have been highly successful . The group assured trading in the second half remained ‘pleasing’ in the face of the currency challenges. Mr Harvey said: ‘Whilst the trading environment in most markets remains challenging, and in particular in Asia as a result of ongoing currency weakness, brand renovation and innovation continues to drive revenue and profit growth across the group.","The Sanctuary in London's Covent Garden is to close after 37 years .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Emily Davies . A Sotheby's art expert who was worried about turning 30 hanged herself having complained about suffering significant stress at work, an inquest heard. Sophie Trevelyan Thomas, 29, said she struggled with a heavy workload at the world famous auction house in London and had wanted to quit, Westminster Coroner’s Court was told. Her inquest heard yesterday that she had suicidal thoughts about no longer being in her twenties, a birthday due next Sunday, and had also felt insecure after a 2007 burglary at home. Tragedy: Sotheby's worker Sophie Trevelyan Thomas, identified by Associated Press looking at Pablo Picasso's painting 'Le Baiser' in 2008, was found dead last November . The Old Masters expert was found dead in her flat in Battersea, South London, last November. Miss Trevelyan Thomas’s brother William found her after checking in on her because she had failed to reply to messages about a family dinner. He told the paramedic she had been having ‘problems at work’ at Sotheby’s, where she had been employed for six years. Police found a suicide note in a book . near the body, in which Miss Trevelyan Thomas had written 'I can’t cope any more’, the inquest heard. The art expert had been seeing psychologist Amy Matheson since 2007, where she complained about problems sleeping after a break-in at home. Workplace: Sophie Trevelyan Thomas, 29, said she struggled with her stressful job at Sotheby's in London and had wanted to quit before she killed herself . In 2012 she told her that she was having work issues and had planned to resign after Christmas, the inquest heard. The psychologist said in a statement that Miss Trevelyan Thomas had been ‘feeling sad all the time’ but had ruled out suicide because ‘it was not easy to do and it would be awful for her mother’. Miss Trevelyan Thomas’s GP, Sheila Fitzgerald, said in a statement that her patient had ‘fleeting’ thoughts about killing herself before her next birthday, but had never self-harmed or attempted suicide. Hearing: An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard that the art expert had been found by her worried brother William after she failed to respond to calls and texts . She complained of a ‘low mood’ and was prescribed antidepressants. William Dolman, the coroner, said that Miss Trevelyan Thomas was ‘someone who had achieved a great deal during her life but found work pressurised and was thinking of resigning her post in the new year’. He recorded a verdict of suicide and said she was disturbed ‘because she was undoubtedly suffering a psychological condition at the time’. Her father Adrian is a barrister specialising in planning and her mother Kate is a GP.  Her sister Tessa, 31, is a City lawyer and William, 27, works for a venture capital firm. They did not attend the inquest. Sotheby's refused to comment.

TMZ also posted a photo allegedly showing a nasty little bite mark on Voronov's arm left by Weir after one spat. According to Radar, it subsequently leaked that Weir used gay sex hookup app Grindr on which the skater sent full-front naked selfies to other men. The battle raged, though with fewer tantalizing public details, until around mid-April. That's when . makeup number one came as Voronov agreed to move back in with Weir so . long as he agree to a list of stipulations that included a public . apology from Weir and written agreement that the skater's mother must . butt out of their married life. Weir then shot back the next day with a bizarre 'post-nuptial agreement' with the reality star's own demands. Video Source Inside Edition . Happier times: The couple had been married just two years (pictured here is their 2011 wedding day) when they announced their divorce in March . Real victim? The couple's dog Tema became a source of drama as Voronov accused Weir of holding the canine hostage . Weir and Voronov married in what looked to be a match made in heaven back in December 2011, but a little over two years in, things publicly started to go downhill fast. Because they also went uphill just as quickly--and on more than one occasion--here is a timeline of the breakups and makeups and some of the juicy bits therein. Breakup, March 19: Weir announced the split via a tweet that read, 'My husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts, and I wish him well.' Weir quickly decided he no longer wished Voronov well as he accused the out-of-work lawyer of physical and emotional abuse. Voronov shot back with accusations of ménage à trois infidelities, Weir's own violent streak (he said Weir bit him) and a claim that the skater was holding their little dog Tema hostage. Makeup, April 14: Voronov reportedly agreed to reconcile and move back into the couple's home, but only if Weir agreed to publicly apologize. The next day, Weir hit back with a sexually explicit 5-page 'post-nuptial' agreement. Breakup, April 16: it was revealed that the couple were not patching things up after all, which Voronov publicly blamed on Weir's mother Pamela. Weir remained mostly silent after this breakup. Makeup, May 6: Weir took to Twitter at 4am to happily announce his second reconciliation with Voronov in two months, writing: . 'To love hard, is the greatest gift, even with all it's flaws. Keep shining.' 'Brawl', May 17: Voronov reportedly called police, claiming Weir had scratched him at their home in New Jersey. The 5-page document included a list of no-no's like extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation outside the marriage, denied each the right to be 'in close range' of any exes and required bi-yearly STD tests from both parties. Something . about the list must not have settled well with Voronov, because the . following day the couple were off again thanks to Weir's mom Patti, who . Voronov told Us Weekly was 'definitely the source of the breakdown of . our marriage.' Fast . forward to 4am on Tuesday morning and, without revealing how fences . were mended or if his mother finally butt out, Weir happily announced he . was back with Voronov. He tweeted following his announcement: . 'To love hard, is the greatest gift, even with all it's flaws. Keep shining.' Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding and emotionally abusive husband . Nasty divorce: Weir, pictured naked on his show Be Good Johnny Weir, was accused by Vornonov of sending  nude photos and steamy messages to men online, and his husband also has nude images of him .","Johnny Weir, 29, reported to police on Sunday for attacking Victor Voronov at the couple's New Jersey home on Saturday night .

"By . Rebecca Evans . and Chris  Brooke . The British woman gunned down by her gardener in Turkey had just ended their six-year affair. After Anne Bury was shot dead by jilted lover Velli Acar  following her 56th birthday party, he handed himself in, shaking and reeking of alcohol, saying: ‘I’ve killed my wife, shot her mother and her son.’ Miss Bury’s only child Alex, 24, and mother Cecilia, 87, survived. Scroll down for video . Relationship: This portrait of Anne Bury and Velli Acar was on display in his parents' home . Denial: Miss Bury's brother denied the 56-year-old was in a relationship with Acar despite the portrait . Affair: Velli Acar (left) was said to be besotted with Anne Bury (right) even after she ended the relationship . Yesterday, one of Acar’s friends told how he arrived at his house after the shooting on Monday,  begging to be taken to the police. Businessman Ozay Akdogen, who has known Acar, 46, for 20 years, said he was besotted with Miss Bury, from Swainby, North Yorkshire, who worked as a risk manager for a Gulf oil company, but she had ended their relationship after he racked up debts of £100,000. He said: ‘Velli was in a state of shock. He said, “I killed my love and now I am finished, take me to the police now.’” Locals in the resort of Dalyan yesterday said Miss Bury and Acar had been together since she bought a plot of land to build her dream home there. She would split her time between Dalyan and her job which regularly took her to the Gulf. Faruk Ozlap, 57, a retired teacher, said: ‘About six years ago Anne came here and met Velli. They built her villa together, he helped her with it all and they started a relationship. 'He was a very poor guy from a poor village and she was his meal ticket.’ Custody: Acar is said friend and local businessman, Ozay Akdogen, to have begged to be taken to police . Shooting: Acar is believed to have killed Miss Bury with a pump action shotgun at this six-bedroom villa . Birthday: Blood stains can be seen at the foot of the stairs after the party ended in horror . Neighbours said it was well-known that Acar had got into debt and had been forced to sell a boat Miss Bury had bought for him. Mr Akdogen, who lives opposite Miss Bury’s villa, said: ‘Anne would come here three or four times a year and every time she would always be with Velli. 'They were in love, no doubt about it. When Anne used to work abroad in Dubai and Qatar, Velli would get me to write her little notes and text messages because his English was not so good. 'But they had problems in the relationship, she told him it was over and it was too much for him.’ Mr Ozlap said: ‘Velli had lost everything. The woman he loved, his home and his job. He had nothing left to lose and now he will never be released from prison.’ No doubt: Acar's best friend Ozay Akdogan (left) said the couple were definitely in love. Alex Bury (right) remains in hospital recovering from a gunshot wound . Wounded: Alex Bury, 23, was rushed to hospital following the incident. His grandmother also needed treatment . He said Miss Bury had phoned the police three days before the killing because Acar was ‘bothering her’. Last night it emerged that Acar was previously married to another British woman, named locally as Ruth McGarry. The relationship is believed to have ended when the gardener began seeing Miss Bury. Miss McGarry, 59, from Malton, North Yorkshire, is understood to still be living in Turkey, but her family said she did not want to talk about what had happened. Miss Bury’s son Alex, who works in medical research, remains in hospital after being shot in the leg. Her mother, who suffered minor wounds, is being comforted by her sons Jerome, 52, and John, 59, who flew out to Turkey from their homes in Stockton, near Middlesbrough. One of the brothers yesterday denied that his sister was romantically linked to Acra, adding: ‘It’s completely untrue. That is not the case.’ Acar’s parents last night said that Miss Bury and their son ‘lived like man and wife’ despite not being married. They said Miss Bury’s family did not know of their relationship.

"By . Rebecca Evans . Speaking out: Kirstie Trup has told for the first time of the terrifying moment she was doused in acid by two strangers . As Kirstie Trup enjoyed an evening stroll through the streets of Zanzibar with a friend, she did not give the moped which pulled up beside her a second thought. For the sight was not uncommon and she was full of happiness after what had so far been the best day of the British student's month-long stint working with underprivileged children on the East African island. But Miss Trup and her friend Katie Gee were suddenly, and without provocation, doused in battery acid by two strangers in a horrific attack which shocked the world. For the first time, the north London teenager has spoken of her ordeal and revealed that despite the mindless brutality of what happened to her last month, she plans to return next year to continue with her charity work. She also reveals how she is haunted by questions as to why she and Miss Gee were attacked, saying: 'Since my return to Britain I have asked myself the same questions every day: why us? Why were Katie and I targeted? What motivated our attackers? Had they been following us our watching us for a while before they decided to carry out their unprovoked assault?' She admits that the clothes she took with her to Zanzibar -shorts, strappy tops and mini-skirts - were wholly inappropriate for a trip to a Muslim country during the holy month of Ramadan. But the teenager insists that this was done in ignorance and she immediately rectified it by buying lots of modest attire, including baggy trousers that both she and Miss Gee were wearing when they were attacked.In an article for the Sunday Times, she . said the friends did nothing to draw the wrong sort of attention to them . and their behaviour was entirely respectable during their month-long . stay. Victims: Kirstie Trup, pictured left, and Katie Gee, both 18, from Hampstead, north London, were walking to a restaurant in Zanzibar when two men on a moped threw a jerry can full of battery acid at them . 'We laughed, sang, and enjoyed every moment we had in Zanzibar, all within the confines of what was religiously acceptable on the island,' she added. 'There we were, two 18-year-old Jewish girls from north London hoping to make some difference in the world while enjoying the life we've been given.' Painful: This photograph released by the teenagers' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the attack . Miss Trup, who is about to commence a history degree at Bristol University, said the first she knew something was amiss was when the moped driver stared at them intently, before nodding suggestively to the passenger sat behind. She said the man smiled and then violently threw a jerry can full of battery acid at them - dousing both girls in a clear liquid which they initially mistook for water. She said: 'Within a second of the moped speeding off, with its tail-light still in sight, we began screaming. 'Our screams were not out of . frustration that our clothes had been drenched. They were screams of . agony. We felt our flesh being seared.' As locals rushed to help, a . disinterested soldier stood nearby watching as the girls lay on the . floor writhing in agony - tearing at their skin and clothes in a futile . bid to abate the pain. 'My entire upper body was burning, especially the right shoulder and torso,' she added. 'So . were my feet, my face and my eyes. The skin on my right forearm looked . as though it had had red paint thrown on it and I immediately noticed . some discolouration on my torso and shoulder. 'The . pain, coupled with the taste of the fluid flung at us - as part of . which had spattered into my mouth - made me quickly realise that it was . not water.' Mercifully, Miss Trup was carried into the nearby Indian . Ocean by three men. The teenagers ran to the Tembo Hotel (pictured) after the attack by two men on mopeds . Kirstie Trup, looked drained and scared as she arrived at hospital after the attack in Zanzibar . Katie Gee was comforted by a fellow traveller as she was driven to hospital in Tanzania . The teenage volunteer appears to be in pain as she is taken to hospital alongside a male friend . She said: 'I jumped in the water in my bra and briefs and began scrubbing my body with my hands. The pain was rapidly intensifying at a much faster pace than I could each burning area of my body. 'I caught a glimpse of the holes that had burnt into my clothes, which the young man was still holding. 'It became obvious to me that Katie and I . had become the victims of a chemical attack.' The girls were then taken . to woefully underequipped local hospital, before a hotel where their . 'seared' skin was treated by standing them under cold showers.' A few hours later they were airlifted to hospital in mainland Tanzania, before being flown back to the UK. Stop off: Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup were flown to the Aga Khan Hospital in Tanzania (pictured) before being flown back to the UK . Tanzania President Jakaya Kikwete visited the two women in hospital and called the attack 'shameful' She spent weeks at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital undergoing skin grafts before being released. Her friend Miss Gee, whose burns were more severe, is still an in-patient. Recalling her initial thoughts after the attack, she said: 'I thought about Katie Piper, the former model and television presenter who had had sulphuric acid thrown in her face on the orders of her ex-boyfriend and the impact that had on her life. 'I was terrified and still in pain, crying, wishing I was back home in Hampstead, north London, along with Mum and Dad, my two brothers and our two dogs.' Miss Trup also reveals that David Cameron has written to her praising her efforts in trying to make a 'real difference to the lives of children'. She writes: 'With each day that passes I reflect on my time in Zanzibar with Katie and the fun we had ... Such happy memories have convinced me to return to the island next year to do more voluntary work.' Care: The two teenagers were both taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after returning to the UK . 'Beyond imagination': The teenage girls were covered by sheets as they were escorted out of an ambulance and into the hospital .

"By . Rebecca Evans . and Inderdeep Bains . A decorated former Parachute Regiment colonel has been murdered by a gang of armed robbers in front of his family in Kenya. Colonel Edward Loden, 73, who commanded the unit that fired all the fatal shots during the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972, was attacked while on holiday visiting his son in Nairobi. He is the second senior Parachute Regiment officer to be killed in a fortnight in the country, following the murder of Lt Col David Parkinson, who was hacked to death by machete-wielding robbers on the nature reserve he managed. Murdered: Colonel Edward Loden, 73, was attacked while on holiday visiting his son Jamie in Nairobi . Father-of-two Col Loden, who recently survived throat cancer, was shot dead by robbers who had lain in wait in bushes as he returned from dinner on Saturday evening to the home of son Jamie, 40, who  is also a former Parachute Regiment officer who served in Afghanistan. He now works as a director with Barclays Bank’s Africa division. Kenyan police said Col Loden, who was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during the 1967 Aden Emergency in Yemen, was with his wife Jill, 69, and his son – who was driving – when they were attacked. His daughter-in-law, Sarah, had stayed at home to babysit. Police said the guard opened the gates to the compound in the upmarket Langata district of the Kenyan capital, and the robbers ran in. An argument took place and the robbers . shot through the windscreen, police said. It is not thought that they . targeted Col Loden. Police said that they stole a necklace and an ATM . card. An investigation has been launched. High crime: Edward Loden was shot dead in a city of Nairobi, which has high crime levels as a result of crippling poverty . The murder took place in the Langata suburb of Nairobi in Kenya . A police source said: ‘The armed thugs were in the bushes nearby. They somehow knew that the family was away and they lay in wait for them to return home. It is a common tactic.’ A statement released yesterday on behalf of the family described the murder as a ‘brutal tragedy’. It read: ‘Edward, married to Jill, father of Jamie and Will, was a devoted family man and proud grandfather of Oliver, Amelia, Joshua, Harry and Emily.’ Col Loden lived with his wife in a £400,000 house in the rural hamlet of Broxhill, in the New Forest, Hampshire. After . leaving the Army in 1992, Col Loden had a career in business management . before retiring seven years later to pursue his passion for sailing. After . joining the Parachute Regiment aged 19 in 1959, he served on operations . around the world, including in Aden. A report at the time said he was . awarded the Military Cross for showing considerable ‘personal bravery . and a high standard of leadership’. He was a key witnesses in the Saville . Inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday, which left 14 Catholic civil . rights marchers dead in Northern Ireland. Then a Major, he was in charge of the Army unit which fired more than 100 shots into crowds. He . was criticised by the families of those who died for failing to stop . his troops from shooting unarmed civilians, but he was later exonerated . by Lord Saville.

"By . Nick Fagge . and Daily Mail Reporter . The world's most wanted woman, Samantha Lewthwaite, hired a luxury health clinic in South Africa for the birth of her fourth child, it has been revealed. The terror suspect, nicknamed the 'White Widow', is believed to have first travelled to the country in 2008, a year after her suicide bomber husband Germaine Lindsay committed the July 7 attacks in London. Two years later on July 24, 2010, Lewthwaite, who is now subject to an Interpol arrest warrant, gave birth to a girl called Surajah whose father is the suspected al-Shabaab terrorist Abdi Wahid. The hardline Islamic couple paid cash for use of the upmarket Genesis clinic, booking under false names. Family portrait: Lewthwaite holds youngest daughter Surajah just after giving birth at the Genesis clinic in 2010 . Waterbirth: The White Widow opted to give birth in a pool similar to this one in one of the clinic's suites. Her partner, suspected terrorist, Abdi Wahid, was present . Luxurious: The Genesis clinic, above,  boasts a 'natural and holistic' service . Lewthwaite, then aged 26, gave her name as Asmaa Shahidah Bint-Andrews while Wahid used the pseudonym Adam Omar. The . clinic is situated in an exclusive Johannesburg suburb called . Saxonwold, it boasts eight private rooms with double beds, marble . bathrooms and private gardens for patients. According . to staff at the clinic, Lewthwaite, a soldier's daughter from . Aylesurby, Buckinghamshire, opted for a water birth with her husband and . three other children present. She . attended appointments prior to the birth wearing a nijab, leaving only . her eyes visible, although staff said the Brit would remove her veil . once the consultations has begun. The . couple paid for an 'Early Bird' deal costing just 6,000 South African . Rand, around £380, which meant they could stay for six . hours after the birth, rather than the standard two nights. Prime location: The couple paid the equivalent of £380 in cash for an 'early bird' service at the clinic which is in an upmarket district of Johannesburg called Saxonwold . Secluded: The birthing suites at the Genesis Clinic, above, come with private gardens for patients . Unkempt: Lewthwaite's midwife said that the family were untidy and that the mother didn't mind her children climbing on her with dirty feet . On the its website, the clinic says it aims to 'envelop patients in luxury.' A . statement reads: 'At Genesis, the environment and service is designed . to make you feel comfortable, safe and enveloped in luxury while . ensuring optimum care for you and your precious newborn. 'The whole idea of an active birth unit is to combine the benefits of labouring and birthing outside of the pressure of a hospital environment with the necessary advantage of having immediate and first class medical care at hand should complications arise. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the midwife who treated Lewthwaite said the wanted woman had described herself as a 'housewife'. She said: 'She came to me quite late in her pregnancy. She said that she was from the UK and had three kids already. She said . she wanted a midwife-assisted delivery because that's how they do it in . the UK. 'She told me that (her husband) had a contract in . South Africa for two years. I think she said he worked in the media. 'She told me she was a housewife and always had been. As I . recall, she came from a broken home and that was why she converted to . Islam.' Scroll Down for Video .

Lewthwaite was registered at four separate addresses in the Mayfair area of Johannesburg, under the name Natalie Faye Webb. The . revelations of Lewthwaite's secret life come just days after files . found on the fugitive's laptop portrayed her as a normal and loving . mother. Among those snaps were pictures showing her family in the Genesis clinic including Wahid. They . are alongside the two children Lewthwaite had with terrorist Lindsay, a . son Abdullah, now nine, and daughter Ruqayyah, eight. Different faces: Lewthwaite in her traditional Muslim headdress, left, is almost unrecogniseable in the natural shot, right, which was taken shortly after she had given birth. Lethwaite is now subject to an Interpol warrant . Lewthwaite, 29, has been on the . run since December 2011 after being linked to a plan to bomb luxury . tourist resorts in the Kenyan coastal resort of Mombasa. She has . also been linked to last month’s horrific terror attack on a Nairobi . shopping mall which killed more than 70 people. The mother of four is the subject of . an international manhunt by nearly 200 countries after she was named in a . Red Alert by Interpol following the atrocity in Nairobi, which was . carried out by gunmen linked to the Al Shabaab terror group. The family pictures, taken in July . 2010, and discovered by British anti-terrorist investigators on a . discarded computer in Kenya, reveal Lewthwaite’s softer side, but locked . in the hard-drive of the laptop and a memory stick, officers made more . chilling discoveries. Lewthwaite - is in hiding after Interpol issued a 'red notice' alert for her capture shortly after the Westgate shopping mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya . Several attackers from the Somali militant group al-Shabab stormed a Nairobi mall, which Lewthwaite has been linked to . They found Lewthwaite had spent eight . years researching bomb-making and searching for the deadly chemicals . used to make improvised explosives devices. And they discovered a poem she wrote, . praising the ideology of Al Qaeda mastermind Osama Bin Laden, who was . killed in Pakistan by US troops in May 2011. Typed clumsily after his death, Lewthwaite proclaims her love for the terrorist chief. She wrote: ‘Oh Sheik Osama my father, . my brother / My love for you is like no other / Oh Sheik Osama now that . you are gone / The Muslims must wake up they must be strong.’ The family photos were taken while . Lewthwaite was living in South African, working in a halal pie factory . under the false name of Natalie Faye Webb. Samantha Lewthwaite wrote that she is preparing her children, pictured, for a life of terror . Safe house: Police found a diary, along with ammunition and smashed computers, at this property in Mombasa . Hideaway: Lewthwaite is believed to have lived here while writing her diary . She is believed to have moved to . Kenya in 2007, just months after she condemned the deadly role her . husband Lindsay played in the 7/7 London bombings that killed 52. She moved to South Africa in 2008 and . adopted the identity of an unsuspecting young woman who had moved to . the UK with her parents as a baby. The Briton later fled the country, . through Tanzania, establishing a base in Mombasa, Kenya, where she is . believed to have become a senior  figure in Al Shabaab. Lewthwaite went into hiding in . December 2011 after she convinced anti-terror police to let her go when . she was arrested following a raid on an Al Shabaab cell. Her British accomplice Jermaine Grant, from London, is on trial in Kenya for terrorist offences. Ghani, 28, from Hounslow, Middlesex, . was killed in a gun battle in Somalia last month after falling out with . senior Al Shabaab members. He had called himself Osama al-Britani. Items: Police found a language card, a religious text, a photograph of her children and a fake vaccination card when they searched one of the houses where Lewthwaite had stayed . Lewthwaite is known to her followers . as dada mzungu – Swahili for  white sister. It is claimed she has become . the ‘trainer’ of an all-female suicide bomber squad targeting . Westerners in East Africa. Her appointment was announced on a . website sympathetic to Al Shabaab, which revealed that Lewthwaite ‘gave . her life to Allah and now she serves Allah as his female soldier in . [Somalia]’, where she ‘commands her all-female mujahid terror squad and . conducts operations against the kuffar [non-Muslims]’. Earlier this year Lewthwaite broke . cover with a Twitter rant at a fellow fanatic. She called fugitive Omar . Hammadi, who has since been killed, ‘an irritating prat’. It stemmed from a feud involving US-born Hammadi and former allies in the Al Shabaab network. Hammadi dismissed Lewthwaite as merely ‘a girl in Kenya’. Lewthwaite hit back: ‘Yes, am a girl . in Kenya like dat makes a difference u misogynist!’ And in a reference . to Mujahideen holy war fanatics, she added: ‘Fyi sam lewthwaite thinks u . r a irritating obnoxious contemptible little Muj PRAT.’ A diary found in one of Samantha Lewthwaite's houses in Mombasa, before she fled in December 2011 .

She claimed to have had no knowledge of the plans . and dreaded the day she would have to tell her children ‘what their . father did’. But earlier this month, the Daily . Mail revealed a manifesto for terrorism that Lewthwaite wrote, . describing her need to murder disbelievers and inciting others – . including her children – to do the same, . The nine-page document revealed how she was grooming her four children to follow in the footsteps of  Lindsay. She wrote how she was ‘blessed’ to . have had a holy warrior husband and of how she had sacrificed her . comfortable Western life  to fight non-Muslims. She said: ‘Allah blessed me with the best husband for me. In fact, exactly what I asked for . . . before marriage.’ Lewthwaite is thought to be in hiding in Tanzania or Somalia.","Samantha Lewthwaite paid cash for 'luxury' delivery of daughter .

"By . Rebecca Evans . and Vanessa Allen . Hacked to death: Lt Col David Parkinson (right) was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja (left), in Kenya . A gang that hacked to death a former Parachute Regiment officer in Kenya may be linked to a previous attack on a British couple, police revealed yesterday. Nature reserve manager Lt Col David Parkinson, 58, was killed by five robbers at his remote home. They took the equivalent of  £1.90 in cash plus a laptop and bottles of wine after Sonja Parkinson, 52, managed to escape and barricade herself in the house’s panic room. A local man has been detained and questioned over the attack on the Parkinsons but has not been formally arrested in connection with Sunday’s break-in at their home in Lolldaiga Hills, near Mount Kenya National Park. The couple were asleep when the robbers used smashed their way into their bedroom  and demanded money and guns. Mrs Parkinson was tied up and threatened and her husband attacked as he fought to defend her. Police believe he may have been knocked  unconscious before being struck with broad-bladed machetes, known locally as pangas. Lt Co Parkinson, from Brighton. East Sussex, was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, where Prince William spent part of his gap year. He was awarded an OBE in 1998 for his military service. Police said there were parallels with the robbery and a raid on the home of another former British army officer and his wife in the region in June. Two men are expected to face trial for  that attack, but two other raiders had not been traced. It is likely that Lt Col Parkinson bled to death during a raid in which by an armed gang stole a laptop, $3 and bottles of wine. A former grammar school pupil from Brighton, he was awarded an OBE at St James’ Palace by Prince Charles in 1998 for his military service. Last night, Kenyan police said the retired soldier’s hand was cut off as he struggled with the intruders in order to give his wife enough time to reach safety. Local police chief Maurice Tum said the robbers gained entry by smashing the windows and ordered Lt Col Parkinson to hand over money and guns. Crime scene: David Parkinson's house in Nanyuki, Laikipia where robbers raided his home and killed him . Grief: Friends of Lt Col Parkinson at his farm are coming to terms with his brutal murder . Tragedy: Lt Col David Parkinson was killed in the farmhouse of the Lolldaiga Hills ranch in Kenya (pictured) He added: ‘A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely. 'The . wife hid in the strong room. It was this decision which saved her. She . came out and found her bleeding husband and contacted the police.’ Lt Col Parkinson, who served in the Army for 30 years, became manager of the ranch after leaving Lewa in 2008. Before taking up his place at St Andrews University, Prince William spent his gap year at Lewa, helping with various conservation projects. In 2010, he and Kate holidayed there, staying in a secluded rustic log cabin where William proposed. The Duchess said: ‘He’s a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in Africa. It was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us.’ Last night the Duke of Cambridge, who is a patron of Lewa, said he was ‘saddened’ to hear about Lt Col Parkinson’s death. Mrs Parkinson, who owns a local arts and crafts company called Mitumba Art, was taken to hospital and treated for shock. 'Saddened': The soldier was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William (right) spent his gap year as a 19-year-old and where he proposed to Kate Middleton (left, with Prince George) A friend and neighbour said: ‘He was very . dynamic, doing an amazing job in Lolldaiga for both conservation and . the community. He was a very well-liked man.’ Lt Col Parkinson joined the Army in 1973 after graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. 'A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely' Maurice Tum, local Kenyan police chief . Known to his fellow soldiers as Parky, he joined the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces, before becoming chief instructor at Sandhurst. On his last tour before retiring, he commanded the British Army training organisation in Nairobi. In 2003, he and his wife permanently relocated to Kenya where he took up his post with Lewa, a growing conservation and community development project. The couple sold their home in Hassocks, West Sussex, for £500,000 three years later. They have two daughters, Anna, 33 and Renate, 29. Lt Col Parkinson took up the post with Lolldaiga Hills at the start of this year. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Kenya and our team at the High Commission in Nairobi are providing consular assistance.’","Lt Col David Parkinson, 58, attacked as he slept beside wife Sonja .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Nick Fagge . Facing question: Sir Hugh Orde, president of the . Association of Chief Police Officers, which allegedly hushed up the . arrest of its own chief executive . Britain's most powerful policing organisation was accused last night of hushing up the arrest of its chief executive. Tom Flaherty, 54, was detained by Scotland Yard detectives after an extraordinary row at the Association of Chief Police Officers. The civilian employee was accused of stealing the desk diary of association president Sir Hugh Orde from his Whitehall office. Even though the matter was dropped Flaherty remains suspended on full pay and could still be sacked for misconduct. Last night the secretive police body faced questions as to why it did not come clean over the allegations. ‘It is absolutely extraordinary that some of the most senior police officers in the land can possibly think it is appropriate to suppress this information,’ said Mark Reckless, a Conservative MP. ‘If working relations at the highest level of Acpo have broken down to this extent I cannot see why the taxpayer should be spending large sums keeping them employed. ‘If they are going to be involved in operational policing, both locally and nationally, they should be subject to appropriate democratic controls.’ The row could not come at a worse time for senior Acpo members, who are fighting for the existence of an organisation that has pushed for more secrecy around police activities and advised forces against naming people it arrests. Its Home Office funding ended last December and many police authorities refused to pay their final fees, leaving it £250,000 out of pocket. Earlier this week police and crime commissioners announced retired military chief Sir Nick Parker will examine whether it is ‘fit for purpose’. Mr Flaherty, a Metropolitan Police Service employee, was seconded to Acpo in 2006 where he was made chief executive and company secretary on up to £112,604 a year. He came from a role in specialist operations, which is responsible for counter terrorism and VIP protection. It is understood he was accused of stealing Sir Hugh’s desk diary, which contained appointments and contacts, in a deliberate act of sabotage. Mr Flaherty was questioned by detectives but the case was dropped without prosecutors being consulted. It is not known whether the diary was recovered. Mr Flaherty has been replaced by Ian Readhead from the Hampshire force. An Acpo spokesman said: ‘Tom Flaherty’s secondment to Acpo from the Metropolitan Police has ended and he has returned to his force following an allegation of misconduct. ‘This is a normal procedure to allow a disciplinary process to take place.’ The case shines a rare light on the . divisions and infighting within Acpo against the background of its . opaque structure, lucrative commercial interests and status as a private . firm. It co-ordinates the . sale of information from the police national computer at vast profit and . markets ‘police approval logos’ for sale on anti-theft devices. But its . central role in the police structure also enables it to write the rules . on how operations are carried out as well as campaigning on key issues. Led . by retired Police Service of Northern Ireland chief Sir Hugh, who earns . £188,736, it has employed many retired chief officers, often on . short-term contracts. One of . its leading members, British Transport Police chief Andy Trotter, led . campaigning for more secrecy around police activities. Secretive: Acpo's central role in the police structure enables it to write the rules on how operations are carried out, as well as selling data from the police national computer. It has employed many retired chief officers . The most recent documents available at Companies House show Acpo employs 22 staff and has a wage bill of £1.7million. It registered assets worth £5million, including £3.5million in cash, and received a total income of £5.8million, including a £1million Home Office grant. In an unusual move, staff applied for a special exemption to remove the designation ‘Ltd’ from Acpo’s title earlier this year. Sir Hugh has pledged to reform the organisation, admitting its status as a private firm is awkward. His critics say little progress has been made.","Tom Flaherty accused of stealing diary of Acpo president Sir Hugh Orde .

"By . Arthur Martin . and Nick Fagge . Crime: A murder inquiry is underway after a 16-year-old, named locally as Ajmol Alom, was stabbed to death . A gifted pupil who was tipped to study medicine at Oxbridge was stabbed to death as he tried to protect a friend from a masked gang. Ajmol Alom collapsed yards from his home after a teenage gangster plunged a knife into his leg in an unprovoked attack on Monday night. The 16-year-old, who is expected to get a string of A*s in his GCSEs when his results are published next week, was chatting with friends when the gang approached. Wearing hoodies and bandanas, the six-strong gang attacked one of Ajmol’s friends, stabbing him through the cheek. When Ajmol tried to intervene, he was stabbed twice in his thigh on the housing estate in Poplar, East London, where he lived. His tearful mother Rohima Khaun ran out of the family home and watched in horror while locals tried to save her son. Paramedics arrived minutes later but were unable to save him. He died hours later in hospital. His friend is still being treated and is expected to make a full recovery. Friends and neighbours yesterday said that Ajmol had been caught up in the latest tit-for-tat attack between rival gangs. They said Ajmol was not involved in any prior attack and was not a member of any gang. His headmaster said Ajmol was ‘the last person you would think this would happen to’. Chris Dunne, of Langdon Park School, said: ‘His results will be out next week and I expect him to have got straight As.

He was such a kind and gentle young man and . will be greatly missed, not just as a pupil but as a young man of . outstanding promise.’ Weeks before his death Ajmol and his . friends hired a Maserati GranTurismo convertible to take them to a . farewell party from school. Special: Ajmol Alom went to Derry City in Northern Ireland after being chosem as an peace envoy to promote inter-faith friendships . 'Bright future': Ajmol was predicted to get top grades in his GCSEs on Thursday, but may have been caught up in a gang row . Ajmol, a keen sportsman, had just finished playing football and was sitting on a wall chatting with friends when he was stabbed. Tribute: Ajmol Alom died last night and today teachers and friends spoke of a 'splendid young man' who did well at school . Residents heard him ‘howling’ in pain and ‘crying out for God’ as he lay bleeding on the floor. Eyewitness Jahed Choudhury said: . ‘Ajmol was stabbed twice in the top of his leg next to his vein. There . was blood coming out everywhere. The ambulance took about 15 or 20 minutes to come. ‘I have spoken to his parents and they are very upset. His mother is taking his death particularly badly. She is hysterical.’ Ajmol, of Bengali heritage, lived in a . second-floor flat with his father Jahangier Alom, who runs an Indian . restaurant, his mother, two brothers aged 15 and ten and a five-year-old . sister. His best friend Najmol Chowdhury, 16, said Ajmol had never been in trouble before. ‘He was still wearing his football kit . when they attacked him,’ Najmol said. ‘It must have been a case of . mistaken identity because he did not have any enemies. He did not have . any problems with other boys.’ Najmol said his friend was exceptionally smart and could have gone on to become anything he wanted. ‘He always got As and A*s,’ he said. ‘He was waiting for his GCSE results but he had nothing to worry about. He had already got an A in maths that he took last year and A*s in all . the sciences – biology, physics and chemistry. He was in the top set for . everything and he was a good sportsman as well.’ In shock: Police guard the street where the killing took place, and residents spoke of a 'nice' local boy who was stabbed to death last night .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Target: Tourists stroll under the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Convicted terrorist Paolo Bellini suggested targeting the landmark, the court heard . The Mafia plotted to blow up the Leaning Tower of Pisa, getting as far as preparing the explosives for the strike more than 20 years ago, a court in Palermo has heard. The plot was hatched in 1992, when the Mafia had declared war on the state, embarking on a series of attacks on police and judges, as well as civilian targets such as museums and trains. Supergrass Gioacchino La Barbera told the court on Wednesday how convicted terrorist Paolo Bellini suggested the target to his mafia associates, during the years of terror. Bellini, nicknamed The Black Primrose, said that they should stop bombing civilian targets and hit Italy’s artistic treasures instead. The court heard how he persuaded boss Nino Gioe that the impact of such a blast would be more powerful, saying: ‘Just imagine. What if Pisa woke up and the Tower wasn’t there!?’ The explosives that were prepared for the attack were eventually discovered by the police. But the plot was shelved after sweeping arrests in 1993, including that of Sicilian godfather Toto Riina, the court was told. The mayor of Pisa said Italy must ‘remain vigilant’ in the security of its national monuments. ‘These are chilling revelations,' he said. 'That the blind criminal brutality of the Mafia had put in place plans for a strike on the Leaning Tower, the bell tower of our Cathedral, the symbol of Italy in the world and a world heritage site is the clearest sign of their character. 'This is the same hatred with which they have scarred other monuments and carried out massacres.’ The Leaning Tower will now become a symbol of the fight against criminality, he said. Tourists visit the Leaning Tower of pisa in April 2011, after it became free of scaffoldings for the first time after 20 years of stabilization and restoration works . The Black Primrose: Paolo Bellini, (pictured left and right) suggested the targets, convincing the boss by saying: 'Just Imagine. What if Pisa woke up and the Tower wasn't there!?' The boss of bosses: The plot to blow up the Leaning Tower of Pisa was shelved when multiple members of the Mafia were arrested, including Salvatore 'Toto' Riina (pictured during a trial in Rome in 1993) The supergrass was speaking at a trial in which representatives of the Italian state are accused of signing a peace treaty with the mafia in the 1990s. Bellini was the go-between, working on a deal between representatives of the state and Cosa Nostra, giving some mafia bosses home or hospital arrest instead of prison, in exchange for revealing the whereabouts of stolen artworks of value, the court heard. The 170 ft bell tower was begun in the 12th century but immediately began to lean because of soft ground on one side. Following corrective work to stabilise it, the eight storey tower is now leaning slightly less. It brings in six million visitors to Pisa every year. Not so leaning tower: These side by side pictures show the tower before the stabilization works in 1992 (left) and at the end of the works in 2010 (right), showing a slightly different level of tilt .","Plot was hatched Paolo Bellini, The Black Primrose, court hears .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Nick Fagge . and Rebecca English . Stopped: The Duke of York was ordered to 'verify his identity' by armed police officers in Buckingham Palace gardens . Prince Andrew reacted with fury at gun-wielding officers who mistook him for an intruder at Buckingham Palace and asked him to 'verify his identity.' Two heavily-armed policemen confronted him as he walked in broad daylight through the grounds, sources revealed last night. The fifth-in-line to the throne stood his ground asking the officers 'Don't you know who I am?' and was said to have ‘made his thoughts plain’ during the highly-charged confrontation that followed. A royal source said: ‘He was incredibly, incredibly angry. It was very much a case of guns being pointed at him and “halt who goes there”.’ Yesterday police issued a humiliating apology to the Duke of York over the extraordinary error. According to the Daily Mirror, a source said that the Duke was red faced as he shouted at officers like a school teacher. They said: 'It got pretty heated because he just kept repeating himself ""Don't you know who I am?"". 'He felt the officers had sneaked up on him and believed they had behaved disrespectfully towards him.' They added that when the penny dropped they apologised to Prince Andrew. But this was not enough. The source added: 'He gave them a proper dressing down, shouting at them like a schoolteacher before he walked back to the main house - completely livid.' It was the second police fiasco within three days at what should be one of the most secure estates in Britain. Just 48 hours earlier officers discovered a mentally ill man attempting to smash down a door with a  fire extinguisher after he scaled a 12ft wall and broke in. Yesterday Scotland Yard revealed senior officers had personally apologised to  Prince Andrew in a bid to draw a line under the latest matter. Scroll down for video . Incident: Prince Andrew had gone for a walk around the gardens in Buckingham Palace when the two officers stopped him . In . an unprecedented statement, a spokesman said: ‘We are grateful to the . Duke for his understanding and have apologised for any inconvenience . caused.’ Scotland Yard . declined to comment on reports that the officers shouted at the . 53-year-old royal, telling him to ‘put your hands up’ and ‘get on the . ground’. A source said it . would not be ‘uncommon’ for police to shout when challenging someone, . but added that they did not know if he was ordered to lie down. In return, Prince Andrew issued a . conciliatory statement, saying: ‘The police have a difficult job to do . balancing security for the royal family and deterring intruders, and . sometimes they get it wrong.’ But . hinting at his anger over the confrontation, he added: ‘I am grateful . for their apology and look forward to a safe walk in the garden in the . future.’ Royal sources . said Andrew had been ‘infuriated’ by the fiasco. They continued to . insist that weapons had been drawn by police, who were in a state of . high tension following the previous security breach. One source said: ‘[Andrew] has calmed down now but it wasn’t a pleasant experience at all, and he was furious at the time.’ The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh attend church today. They were accompanied by Prince Charles . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were in Aberdeenshire for the Braemar Gathering where they attended a church service this morning . Another . palace aide told the Mail: ‘The police have acknowledged the incident . and apologised and he is happy to move on. He knows they have a . difficult job to do and is supportive of them.’ However, . senior palace sources also made clear that the prince had not been . willing to make a public statement until he had received a full apology . from the Met. Break in: Victor Miller was arrested inside the palace . The prince had just . returned from a two-week holiday in Spain with his former wife Sarah, . the Duchess of York, and their daughters Beatrice, 25, and Eugenie, 23. The . pair of uniformed marksmen challenged him after discovering him near a . perimeter wall in a relatively isolated area of the palace garden. Royal . staff are said to be incredulous that those involved failed to . recognise the prince, although officially police chiefs are saying they . did nothing wrong. One . source said: ‘Once it was clear who Andrew was, he certainly made his . thoughts plain about what had happened. 'It has been the subject of a lot . of conversation, especially as Andrew is not exactly known for . suffering fools gladly.’ His former protection officer Ken Wharfe describes him as rude, bossy and terse. At . the time of the incident, the Met’s Royal protection unit was on high . alert after Victor Miller, 37, was caught inside the ornate State Rooms . on Monday night. The complex can be accessed only through an inner . courtyard at the heart of the palace. The . DJ and sound engineer – who claims to have worked with stars including . Amy Winehouse, N-Dubz and Tinchy Stryder – is being held in a secure . mental health unit after being arrested and questioned on suspicion of . burglary, trespass and criminal damage. A suspected accomplice, a man aged 38, was found outside the palace and arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary. No royals were present when the break-in took place but experts are incredulous that Miller got so far before being stopped. The . two incidents highlight the tension between police and the royal family . over security. The Queen – who is currently staying at Balmoral Castle . with Prince Philip – has made it clear she wants the palace to be . accessible to the public as possible. Former . Scotland Yard Commissioner Lord Blair played down the Prince Andrew . confrontation as he said it was impossible to make any site completely . secure. ‘They will have to look at this,’ he added. ‘The story of the . burglar is a much more difficult story than the Andrew story.’ Last . night, former royal protection chief Dai Davies said of the Prince . Andrew incident: ‘[The officers] were alert and that was good, but . saying that, they should know who His Royal Highness is. ‘It . is a very big garden and we don’t know where he was and who he told, . but you would expect officers to be aware if he had gone out. 'Why wasn’t . anybody aware that he was having a walk about? ‘They . are right to challenge anybody they don’t know, quite obviously if they . don’t and something happens … they are criticised.’ A . Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to comment on whether the . officers would face any disciplinary action or ‘words of advice’. He . said: ‘Uniformed officers approached a man in the gardens of Buckingham . Palace to verify his identity. The man was satisfactorily identified. ‘No . weapons were drawn and no force  was used.

"By . Nick Fagge . and Ben Spencer . and Tom Kelly . A Bulgarian Roma woman believed to be the real mother of the ‘blonde angel’ found in a Greek gypsy camp declared yesterday: ‘I want her back.’ Mother-of-ten Sasha Ruseva, 35, claims she did not sell Maria, now four, but was forced to leave her daughter with a friend in Greece as a baby because she could not afford the legal documents required to take her home to Bulgaria. But the Daily Mail can reveal that a woman of her name has twice previously been arrested for trying to sell babies in Greece – and on both occasions skipped bail. Scroll down for video . A DNA test has confirmed Sasha Ruseva a Bulgarian Roma woman is the mother of a mystery girl known as Maria, found living with a couple in Greece . Mother-of-ten Sasha Ruseva, 35, (children, left) claims she did not sell Maria (right), who is now four years old . Today the Mail tracked down Mrs Ruseva, who police believe will be shown by DNA tests to be Maria’s real mother, to an impoverished gypsy camp in Nikolaevo in rural Bulgaria where her family share a one-room home without running water. Her husband Atana Rusev, 37, has an albino gene in his family that may have resulted in Maria’s blonde hair and pale complexion. Five of the couple’s other children are blonde and closely resemble Maria. Mystery has surrounded the identity of the parents of the blue-eyed girl since she was discovered after police raided a Roma gypsy camp in central Greece last week. A couple who posed as her parents for four years to make money from her begging are believed to have bought the child for £850. Maria’s case attracted global attention, with thousands of calls from people who believe they may know her identity. Mrs Ruseva wept yesterday as she insisted: ‘I did not sell Maria, nor did I give her away. For the past four years I have never forgotten Maria. I pray for her every day. I want her back, I want her back.’ Mother-of-ten Sasha Ruseva, 35, whose children are pictured here, claims she did not sell Maria . A woman with the name Sasha Ruseva has twice previously been arrested for trying to sell babies in Greece . Mrs Ruseva, who was just 13 when she had her first child, said she was pregnant with Maria when she went to Greece to work as a field hand on a farm with her husband. She said her eldest daughter remained in Bulgaria to look after her other children but that arrangement stopped when she got married and wanted to move out, forcing Mrs Ruseva to return home. She claimed she could not bring Maria back with her as the Greek authorities required she pay ‘hundreds of euros’ for a birth certificate for her daughter, which she could not afford. She said: ‘I gave birth to Maria about four and a half years ago. I can’t remember the exact date. ‘I cared for Maria for seven months but I had to come back to Bulgaria look after my other children. ‘I left my daughter with my room-mate. She is also Roma. When I left Maria I asked the woman to send  her to Bulgaria. But she hasn’t. I cannot remember her name, it was four years ago. ‘I missed Maria but I don’t have any money so I did not know what to do. I called the woman several times and I knew she was safe and well. I don’t know why she kept her so long, why they did not send her back to me. ‘I don’t have enough money to call the woman in Greece any more so I stopped trying to get in touch with her. I didn’t know what was happening with my child. But I have never stopped wanting her, she is my own flesh and blood.’ This is the family's one-bedroom home in the impoverished gypsy camp in Nikolaevo in rural Bulgaria . Mrs Ruseva, who was just 13 when she had her first child, said she was pregnant with Maria when she went to Greece to work as a field hand on a farm with her husband . Mrs Ruseva and her husband registered the birth of a child four years ago at a hospital in Lamia, an hour from the Farsala camp where Maria was found. Greek police think Maria may have been sold on by a baby-smuggling gang who offer newborns to childless couples for up to £22,000. It is believed that Maria was sold for a knockdown price because police were moving in on child smugglers in the area. Judicial records show that a Sasha Ruseva was arrested in early 2009 – the same period as Maria  was handed to the gipsies in Greece – on suspicion of trying to sell a baby, but she skipped bail and escaped with the child. In January this year a Sasha Ruseva was arrested in Thessaloniki, close to the Bulgarian border, for the same offence. On that occasion a child was taken into care and the mother was charged but disappeared before a court hearing. Sotiris Koutsobelis, deputy mayor of Lamia, the town where Maria was born, told the Mail last night: ‘It seems that Ruseva has been selling babies all along.’ An ID card for a baby – the only documentation needed for it to be taken between Greece and Bulgaria – costs just 15 euros (£12.80). A man claiming to be Mrs Ruseva’s brother last night alleged she had sold Maria for 250 euros, contradicting her account. The man, who asked not to be named, told local radio: ‘We knew that my sister had a child in Greece, and gave it to friends there because it was impossible to support it, but she and her husband would see her quite often in Farsala. They still love Maria very much. She told us that the couple paid her 250 euros for the child.’ Judicial records show that a Sasha Ruseva was arrested in early 2009 - the same period as Maria  was handed to the gipsies in Greece - on suspicion of trying to sell a baby . Greek police think Maria may have been sold on by a baby-smuggling gang who offer newborns to childless couples for up to £22,000 . Mrs Ruseva and her husband were arrested and questioned for a few hours yesterday morning by Bulgarian police as part of a joint operation with Greek officers. Mr Rusev said: ‘I never got any money for Maria. The police asked us questions about her, but we don’t know anything. We told them we want her back.’ He added: ‘I can’t remember all of my children’s names because there are so many of them.’ His brother said Mr Rusev has been ‘out of his mind’ since he first saw a picture of Maria on Bulgarian television two days ago and has barely stopped drinking since. The family survive on child benefit payments of £40 a month from the Bulgarian state and live on potato soup and homemade bread. Mrs Ruseva said: ‘Look at us, look at the place we live. We don’t have anything. We have only one bed. Three of the children sleep in it. The rest of us have to lie on the floor. ‘I don’t know how to pay for  their clothes. That is why I send them to school dirty and without shoes or clothes. Look at me. Look at how dirty I am.’ DNA testing is being carried out on Mrs Ruseva and the authorities have collected information about her trips to Greece in recent years.

Hristos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, who posed as Maria’s parents, are in custody in Greece accused of child abduction. Maria’s case has spurred concerns about child trafficking within the Roma community, as well as accusations of racism towards them. In an episode apparently prompted by the Greek case, two blond, blue-eyed children were taken by police in Ireland from their Roma parents who had different physical characteristics. The girl and boy were returned to their families on Wednesday after DNA tests determined the children were rightfully theirs.","Sasha Ruseva claims she did not sell Maria, who is now four years old .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . If you’ve ever wanted to see a shipwreck up close in real time, now’s your chance. Over the next week the Hercules Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) will be exploring a section of the Gulf of Mexico home to a sunken German U-Boat and a U.S. passenger ship from World War Two. And you can watch the vehicle’s exploration of the area live as it also observes brine pools, lakes and deep-water coral reefs, with the channel staying on-air until 9 October. Scroll down for more video . This mission is just the latest adventure this year for the Nautilus ship and its crew, operated by Ocean Exploration Trust, where users can ask questions directly to the scientists . This neutrally buoyant yellow Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is the workhorse of the Nautilus Exploration Program. It is always used in tandem with another remotely operated vehicle, Argus. Hercules is equipped with six thrusters that allow the pilots to ‘fly’ it in any direction, plus two manipulator arms designed for collecting samples and recovering artifacts. Video from Hercules' high-definition main camera is streamed up a fiber-optic cable to the control van on Nautilus, then out to the world. It is capable of operating down to 13,100 feet (4,000 metres). It has already performed several successful missions and has more scheduled up to 9 October as part of the 2014 Nautilus Expedition. This particular project is known as ‘Exploring the Unknown America’, during which it may visit up to four shipwrecks. Of the shipwrecks that might be visited, one is the German U-boat U-166, which sank with all hands on deck in 1942 from depth charges released by American patrol vessel PC-566. This makes it the only known U-boat to be sunk in the Gulf of Mexico. The sinking of U-166 followed its own attack on the steam passenger ship Robert E. Lee, which it torpedoed and sent to the bottom of the ocean a few minutes prior. Of the 270 passengers on the ship, however, 250 of them were saved by PC-566. The attack on the passenger ship was a result of Germany’s policy of ‘unrestricted submarine warfare’ in World War Two, which saw them target ships of any sort. The wrecks of the two vessels are just a few miles apart in the Gulf of Mexico. Wrecks for exploration include the German U-boat U-166 sank and the steam passenger ship Robert E. Lee, both of which sunk in 1942. Other potential sites for exploration include two oil tankers that were also sunk in World War Two by German U-boats, the Gulf Penn and Gulf Oil . The Hercules remotely operated vehicle is preparing to explore the Gulf of Mexico over the next week including several shipwrecks, one being the German U-boat U-166 (gun shown). This sank with all hands on deck in 1942 from depth charges released by American patrol vessel PC-566 .

Other potential sites for exploration by the Hercules include two oil tankers that were also sunk by German U-boats in World War Two, the Gulf Penn and Gulf Oil. These tankers are particularly interesting because they have a high number of large corals growing on them. The mission will be run from the Corps of Exploration’s flagship vessel, E/V Nautilus. It is one of only two dedicated ships of exploration in the world. The 211-foot (64 metres) ship is equipped with all of the latest in ocean technology and can host a 31 person science team in addition to 17 crew members. The ship is outfitted for a two-tiered approach to exploration. First the team uses a multibeam sonar system to map unknown areas of the seafloor. Once the data is analyzed and targets are chosen, they use remotely operated vehicles to collect video footage and a variety of samples. Up to the end of 2014 the ship and its crew will continue to explore locations in the Gulf of Mexico and surrounding waters.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Binge drinking is becoming a deadly problem in the U.S. with New Mexico and Alaska topping the chart for the most alcohol-related deaths. A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that several mountain-region states have a higher than average number of deaths. Figures showed that about 88,000 Americans died from drink-related causes each year, and that about 70 percent of those deaths were of working age adults. Maps of the U.S. above and below show the extent of binge drinking in individual states in 2010 . Health researchers compiled information on alcohol-related deaths - from violence and car crashes to heart disease - that took place between 2006 and 2010. New Mexico 16.4 percent . Alaska 15.9 percent . Colorado 14.2 percent . Wyoming 13.4 percent . Arizona 13.4 percent . Montana 13.2 percent . California 12.3 percent . Nevada 11.6 percent . Oregon 11.6 percent . Idaho 11.3 percent . Figures from CDC . What they found was that while the national average was one in 10 deaths that could be attributed to alcohol, states including New Mexico had far higher figures. They found that excessive drinking was the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the U.S., and that young men were the group most likely to meet an untimely death because of drinking. 'Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable death that kills many Americans in the prime of their lives,' Ursula Bauer, of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, said. 'We need to redouble our efforts to implement scientifically proven public health approaches to reduce this tragic loss of life and the huge economic costs that result.' The study looked at how binge drinking could be attributed to deaths caused by everything from liver disease and cancer to car crashes . The study counted binge drinking as more than four drinks a day for women and five for men . After New Mexico, with 16.4 percent rate, states with the highest alcohol-related deaths in the 20-64 age group were Alaska, with 15.9 percent, Colorado with 14.2 percent, and Wyoming with 13.4 percent. Alcoholic liver disease 14,364 . Liver cirrhosis 7,847 . Homicide 7,756 . Vehicle crashes 12,460 . Poison (non alcholol) 8,404 . Suicide 8,179 . Fall injuries 7,541 . Alcohol dependence syndrome 3,728 . Alcohol abuse 2,022 . Alcohol poisoning 1,647 . Figures from CDC . The highest causes of deaths among all age groups including liver disease - attributed to 14,364 deaths, as well as car crashes, which accounted for 12,460 deaths, and murders, at 7,756. Authors of the study, which was published in Preventing Chronic Disease, also accounted for fetal alcohol syndrome and child abuse. 'Excessive alcohol use is a huge public . health problem. It's killing people in the prime of their lives,' Dr Robert Brewer, of the CDC Alcohol Program, told the Huffington Post. The study suggested that those who had died from alcohol-related reasons had on average lost 30 years of life. The largest age group affected was aged from 20 to 64. A map of the U.S. that illustrates the findings showed that a line of states stretching from Montana to Arizona had above average deaths. Health researchers say consumers need to be more aware of what constitutes 'one drink' On the other end of the scale, Maryland residents appeared to have the healthiest attitude to drinking, with only 7.5 percent of deaths attributable to alcohol. The study looked at 54 causes of death that could be attributed to drinking, including alcohol poisoning, liver disease, accidents, and breast cancer. Researchers also looked at the impact of excessive drinking - more than eight drinks a week for a woman and 15 for a man - and how that affected chronic disease. An estimated 38 million Americans drink more than the recommended weekly limit, leading other health researchers to believe that the CDC findings could be lower than the reality. Dr David Crabb, of the Indiana Alcohol . Research Center, told the Huffington Post: 'A lot of the injury isn't just the people you consider alcohol abusers, but a much a larger group that binge drink or consume higher levels than recommended.'","88,000 Americans a year die from drink-related causes, health study finds .

Mr Pruvic said: 'I love butterflies but when you look closely at them and take shots like this, it's almost like seeing an alien species. They're so strange but beautiful, up close' Butterflies use a 'sun compass' in their antenna to help them make their 2,000 mile migratory journey to overwintering sites. During the absence of daylight cues, migrants have been, surprisingly, seen flying in the expected southerly direction. It’s been suggested they use geomagnetic cues to help navigate when day light cues are unavailable to them during migration. Tests in the simulator revealed that the butterflies used the inclination angle of Earth’s magnetic field to guide their movement. 'This is the time when they are easier to approach and I could get as close as possible without spooking them.' Each of the butterflies are adults, varying in size from three to seven centimetres when measured from their heads to their tails. Despite the delicate feathers almost covering their huge eyes, the butterflies have exceptionally good eyesight. The antennae protruding from the centre of their heads curl beautifully, and take a different style depending on the type of butterfly.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Corey Charlton . The opening night of Grammy-nominated DJ Avicii's U.S. tour ended in disarray with at least 36 fans rushed to hospital. Lines of ambulances were seen parked outside the venue, as concertgoers, many in their teens or early 20s, were taken away from the TD Garden show in Boston. Alcohol and drugs, and in particular the party drug 'Molly', are thought to have been a factor in some of the cases as youngsters passed out in the packed arena and witnesses reported struggling to breathe in the cramped conditions. The drug Molly is a strong form of ecstasy which has been linked in recent years to a spate of overdoses. However, its exact chemical makeup and purity is known to vary significantly, making it almost impossible to anticipate the effects of a single 'dose'. Scroll down for video .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A frozen world, similar to Earth, that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life. The new planet, located 3,000 light years away, is twice as massive as Earth and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the Earth is from the sun. Until the discovery, no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system. Planets orbiting pairs of binary stars are relatively common. Until the discovery, no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system. The second star in the binary system is also very dim. The two are only as far apart as the distance between Saturn and the sun . 'This greatly expands the potential locations to discover habitable planets in the future,’ said Professor Scott Gaudi, from Ohio State University. 'Half the stars in the galaxy are in binary systems. We had no idea if Earth-like planets in Earth-like orbits could even form in these systems.' Named OGLE-2013-BLG-0341LBb, the planet’s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. Named OGLE-2013-BLG-0341LBb, the planet¿s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. It has been described as the real-life version of ice planet Hoth (pictured) featured in Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back orbits, and is almost certainly a lifeless world . It has been described as the real-life version of ice planet Hoth featured in Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back orbits, and is almost certainly a lifeless world. But the astronomers point out that the same planet orbiting a sun-like star would be in the 'habitable zone' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life. Professor Gould led four international teams reporting on the discovery in the journal Science. The planet was found by chance when scientists spotted an unusual signal in light from a 'microlensing event'. The binary system containing the new planet disturbed light from a much more distant star 20,000 light years away in the constellation Sagittarius (pictured) Two 'Goldilocks' planets thought to lie in the habitable zone of a Gliese 581, a dwarf star just 20 light years from the sun, have turned out not to exist. Researchers found that light signals that seemed to be from the planets were actually created by events in the star itself. A star’s habitable orbital region is known as the 'Goldilocks' zone because conditions there are not too hot or too cold but 'just right' to support life. Astronomers announcing the news in the journal Science were not disheartened, however. 'This result is exciting because it explains, for the first time, all the previous and somewhat conflicting observations of the intriguing dwarf star Gliese 581,' said Dr Paul Robertson, from Pennsylvania State University in the US. Gliese 581 has three other confirmed planets, none of which lie within its habitable zone. This occurs when a star’s gravity acts like a lens, bending light from a much more distant object precisely behind it. In this case, the binary system containing the new planet disturbed light from a much more distant star 20,000 light years away in the constellation Sagittarius. The planet caused a 'dip' and distortion in the light signal which after computer analysis provided information about its mass, distance from the star, and orientation. Data from a network of telescopes in Chile, New Zealand, Israel and Australia, were used to confirm the findings. 'In gravitational microlensing we don’t even look at the light from the star-planet system,' said Professor Gould. 'We just observe how its gravity affects light from a more distant, unrelated star. This gives us a new tool to search for planets in binary star systems.' The second star in the binary system is also very dim. The two are only as far apart as the distance between Saturn and the sun. Computer analysis by Professor Cheongho Han at Chungbuk National University, Korea, suggests the planet is -210°C (- 352°F). Binary star systems composed of dim stars like these are the most common type in the Milky Way. So the discovery suggests there may be many more terrestrial planets out there, some possibly warmer, and even harbouring life. Professor Gould added: 'Normally, once we see we have a binary, we stop observing. 'The only reason we took such intensive observations of this binary is we already knew there was a planet. In the future we will change our strategy.'","Planet is twice as massive as Earth and has a temperature of -210°C .

The housemate, who Kelly rented a room from, told Pix11.com that Kiam was dressed in a white-collared shirt, tie and pants, when he was taken to hospital – and a picture of him dressed like this appeared the next day on Kelly’s Facebook page. There is widespread speculation, therefore, that she had posted a picture of Kiam’s lifeless body. Along with the photograph carrying the ‘R.I.P’ headline, Kelly left a message that read: ‘Missing my baby boy so much wish there was some way I could bring him back to life. I feel horrible knowing he passed away Am his Mother I was supposed to protect him I know his spirit will always be around me.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nicole 'Nikki' Kelly, from New York, is accused of murdering her toddler son .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . One of the top contenders for the most Earth-like world beyond our solar system is not a real planet but a cosmic masquerade. This is according to new research that claims what astronomers believed to be Gliese 581g was simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star. When it was first discovered in 2010, Gliese 581g excited astronomers as it looked similar to Earth in both size and temperature. One of the top contenders for the most Earth-like world beyond our solar system is not a real planet, but a cosmic masquerade.This is according to new research that claims what astronomers believed to be Gliese 581g (artist's impression pictured) was simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star . It was, they believed, the first planet outside our solar system in the Goldilocks zone around its star – an area not too hot and not too cold for life. Now, researchers at Pennsylvania State University have shown that what was found wasn't a planet at all. They also claim that another planet in the same solar system, known as Gliese 581d, announced in 2009 and less hospitable to life, doesn't exist. Three outside experts agreed. Pennsylvania State University astronomer Paul Robertson said that the two planets turned out to be magnetic outbursts from a star. Gliese 581 (the bright star shown in the centre), which is 22 light-years away, has three other confirmed planets, none of which lie within its habitable zone . 'This result is exciting because it explains, for the first time, all the previous and somewhat conflicting observations of the intriguing dwarf star Gliese 581,' said Dr Robertson. Gliese 581, which is 22 light-years away, has three other confirmed planets, none of which lie within its habitable zone. To find Gliese 581g, University of California, Santa Cruz astronomers looked for subtle changes in light caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet tugging back and forth on the star. The strength of the tugging, they thought, showed them a planet was about three times as massive as Earth. The discovery of Earth-like planets around Gliese 581 caught the public imagination. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have shown that what was found, Gliese 581 g, wasn't a planet at all. They also claim that another planet in the same solar system, known as Gliese 581d, announced in 2009 and less hospitable to life, doesn't exist. Three outside experts agreed . Documentary-maker RDF and social-networking site Bebo used a radio telescope in Ukraine to send a powerful focused beam of information - 500 messages from the public in the form of radiowaves - to Gliese 581. And the Australian science minister at the time organised 20,000 users of Twitter to send messages towards the distant solar system in the wake of the discoveries. But were doubts at the time of the discovery. For instance, Swiss astronomers cast doubt on the original research claiming they could find no trace of the planet in their own analysis of the same data. Other exoplanets have previously been doubted, most notably Alpha Centauri Bb, the closest Earth-sized world to us which some scientists claim could just be noise in the data. Dr Robertson said that the unmasking of Gliese 581 d highlights the need to remain cautious amid the recent rise in exoplanet discoveries. A frozen world, similar to Earth, that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life. The new planet, located 3,000 light years away, is twice as massive as Earth and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the Earth is from the sun. Until the discovery, no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system. Planets orbiting pairs of binary stars are relatively common. 'This greatly expands the potential locations to discover habitable planets in the future,’ said Professor Scott Gaudi, from Ohio State University. 'Half the stars in the galaxy are in binary systems. We had no idea if Earth-like planets in Earth-like orbits could even form in these systems.' Named OGLE-2013-BLG-0341LBb, the planet’s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. It has been described as the real-life version of ice planet Hoth featured in Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back orbits, and is almost certainly a lifeless world. But the astronomers point out that the same planet orbiting a sun-like star would be in the 'habitable zone' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life.

"By . Matthew Blake . When Kim Jong Un wants to reward his faithful minions he puts on a magnificent spread replete with all the trimmings. There were dips, deep-fried vegetables and even some boiled eggs on offer as the North Korean despot thanked officers for fulfilling his father's dying dream: to plant a lot of trees. He made the bountiful gesture following an inspection of the Ryo Islet Defense Detachment - a vast military base responsible for protecting the island of Ryodo and the coastal city of Wonsan. Bountiful: There were dips, deep-fried vegetables and even some boiled eggs when the North Korean despot thanked officers for fulfilling his father's dying dream: to plant a lot of trees . Wonson is an area of particular strategic importance to Kim because on its outskirts lies his favourite luxury holiday home. '[The outpost] is an important combat mission of the detachment to definitely turn the islet into an impregnable fortress and unsinkable battleship and thus not to allow enemies to invade the socialist homeland,' state-run news agancy KCNA said. Another inspection: He made the bountiful gesture following an inspection of the Ryo Islet Defense Detachment - a vast military base responsible for protecting the island of Ryodo and the coastal city of Wonsan . The young leader and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, have frequently visited the vacation home and last year ordered the creation of the nation's first beach resort in the city. Kim praised the military detachment for successfully doing 'everything the Party Central Committee considered as good,' while also saying that it is 'a model unit where the party's military policy is being most correctly implemented and a typical one for the whole army to learn from,' according to the report. Holiday home: Wonson is an area of particular strategic importance to Kim because on its outskirts lies his favourite luxury holiday home (pictured visiting a nearby ski resort) Dying wish: The North Korean despot (pictured, left, crying at a memorial service for his father) thanked officers for fulfilling his Kim Jong Il's (right) dying dream to plant a lot of trees . It was a marked change from the thunderous mood he was seen in last when he publicly scolded the national weather service for giving incorrect forecasts and using out-of-date equipment. In a rare public dressing down of a government body, Kim urged the Hydro-meteorological Service to update its equipment and improve its work. 'There are many incorrect forecasts as the meteorological observation has not been put on a modern and scientific basis,' Kim said, telling the agency to 'fundamentally' improve its work and equipment. Kim Jong-Un has issued a rebuke to a government agency in North Korea, criticising the weather service for giving 'incorrect' forecasts and using out of date equipment . Public criticism is rare in North Korea, with Kim usually keen to praise government agencies in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success . Accurate forecasts are needed to protect the 'lives and properties' of people from disasters caused by 'abnormal climatic phenomenon', he said. Calling the weather service 'very important work directly affecting the overall economic affairs', Kim also underscored the need to 'modernise meteorological observation equipment at a high level', KCNA said. It was not clear when Kim visited the agency, but public criticism of government officials during field trips by North Korean leaders is extremely rare. Usually Kim's official visits are marked by broad smiles and adoring crowds while Kim praises the work people are doing, in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success.","He made the gesture after inspecting  the Ryo Islet Defense Detachment .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Veteran actress Jean Alexander, whose role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street made her a household name, was rushed to hospital last week, it has been revealed. Ms Alexander, 88, who lives in Southport, has suffered numerous health problems in recent years. She was seen being taken away in an ambulance  by a concerned neighbour. Health scare: Jean Alexander, pictured left as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street, was rushed to hospital last week. She was last seen on TV in Last Of The Summer Wine (right) Legendary: Jean Alexander with her on-screen husband, Stan, played by Bernard Youens . Jean Alexander played Rover’s Return cleaner Hilda Ogden from 1964 to 1987, during which time she became one of the most-loved characters the soap has ever had. She was voted the greatest TV character of all time in a Radio Times poll and her trademark headscarf and curlers made her one of the most recognisable, too. While Hilda was often used to bring light relief to the soap, the moment she cried over the sight of her dead husband’s glasses is thought by some to be one of the most powerful moments in soap history. Hilda had an on-screen husband called Stan, played by Bernard Youens, and the pair were known for their bickering. But underneath the surface tension was a rock-solid marriage that never wavered. A survey by NTL: Home granted them the accolade of Britain's top romantic TV couple in 2002. She told the Daily Mirror: 'The ambulance crew came to her home. I hope she's okay.' The actress was under observation for a number of days, but has since been released, according to the Liverpool Echo. The Mirror had earlier claimed that the actress had died, but has since retracted the story. Ms Alexander starred on Coronation Street for 23 years,  eventually leaving the show in 1987. She admitted that while she understood that the show had to move on, she longed for the days when the street was gentle, funny and human. The retired actress felt the humour has all but gone out of the soap. Ms Alexander also said that she would not return to Coronation Street after bowing out following the death of her on-screen husband Stan. She told the Daily Express: 'It is more than 25 years since she [Hilda] left the Street and I have been asked a number of times to do an episode but she wouldn't be the ""old scrubber"" she was, now. 'Hilda had a bit of sense in her head; she would have adapted, smartened herself up and learned to speak better. She added: 'People would want her to be the old Hilda. I couldn't do that.' The veteran star was last seen on screen in Last Of The Summer Wine, which ended in 2010. Veteran actress: Jean Alexander starred in Coronation Street for 23 years, becoming a household name .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . What do you do when a mongoose is ostracised from his troop because he doesn’t smell like he used to, leaving him all alone? That was the problem facing Fort Wayne Children’s Zoo in Indiana, before they came up with an innovative solution. Zookeepers decided that, instead of trying to return his original smell, they would use Vicks VapoRub to make all the mongooses smell the same - and they were able to reintegrate the lonely mongoose into the pack. Zookeepers at Fort Wayne Children's Zoo in Indiana have used Vicks VapoRub to reintegrate a mongoose into a troop after he was kicked out for losing his scent. The method relied on the mongooses taking part in 'scent marking' (pictured), where they roll in a new scent to all smell the same . The problem started when one of the zoo’s banded mongooses, one commonly found in Africa, had his medical checkup reports the zoo. Back in 2007 experts at Paultons Park near Romsey in Hampshire were concerned that their two existing meerkats would fight with three new arrivals when they were introduced to the family attraction. So they came up with the plan to use the decongestant - known to millions of humans who want to ease their cold symptoms. The product was put on the animals' noses and hid their scent long enough for all of them to get used to each other without any arguments. Livestock manager Geoff Masson said: 'It is normally extremely difficult to integrate new meerkats into an existing group - their usual instinct is to try to attack any newcomers. 'However, thanks to a suggestion from our vet, Kate Chitty, we were able to neutralise all odours by using a little of the VapoRub on the nose of each meerkat.' Upon his return the zookeepers found that the rest of his troop wasn’t keen on him rejoining, despite him being the same mongoose. This was because he smelled different; for mongooses, smell is a big indicator of identity in order to recognise each other. Some of the other mongooses even became aggressive to him, leaving him lonely and without a troop. That was when zookeeper Nancee Hutchinson found a unique solution. Troops of mongooses are known to roll around in a smell in a process known as ‘scent marking’. This common tactic in the wild ensures members of a troop all smell the same. So, with this in mind, Hutchinson put her plan into action. ‘We bring them indoors and spray Vicks VapoRub on the floor,’ she said. ‘The whole troop comes running and rolls all around in it. Then they all smell the same, even the one who spent some time away. Zookeeper Nancee Hutchinson's novel solution to use Vicks VapoRub (pictured) built on previous work at a UK zoo in 2007, where zookeepers had used the cough medicine to hide the scent of meerkats and allow them to integrate more easily. 'We bring them indoors and spray Vicks VapoRub on the floor,' said Hutchinson . The method has been used before at a zoo in Romsey, UK to get the same result with meerkats. ‘When we spray Vicks inside the mongoose enclosure, the mongooses respond by scent-marking,’ continued Hutchinson. ‘They all roll around in the Vicks. This overrides any old smells that might have caused them to reject a member.’","A zoo in Indiana used Vicks VapoRub to make mongooses smell alike .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Perhaps he’d been listening to Handel’s Water Music recently. Quite what made a busking cellist think it was a good idea to settle a dispute with a rival street performer by hurling a bucket of water at him isn't clear. But it's certain that he will think twice about doing it again, because he was arrested over the alleged incident. Scroll down for video . Striking a wrong chord: A police officer tackles a cellist after the musician threw a bucket of water (right) over a rival busker . Group effort: Members of the public help the police officer calm the cellist down . Penalty notice: The cellist was fined £90 over the incident . The 45-year-old musician got into an unseemly row with a guitar-playing busker after they both started performing on the same pitch. The guitarist, Paul Scofield, who had a permit to play in Bucky Doo Square in Bridport, Dorset, asked the cellist to move along as it was claimed he had no such licence. The pair attempted to play over one another while standing a few yards apart, before the man with the cello marched off and reportedly filled up a bucket of water. Aftermath: The guitarist dries off after he was drenched by the watery assault . He returned and allegedly hurled the bucket over the stunned guitarist, leaving him wet through. Bridport PC Scott McGregor witnessed the incident and detained the offender in front of stunned shoppers. The cellist was later released with a £90 on-the-spot fine. The guitarist was said to be drenched but afterwards moved into the sun to dry off and carried on playing. PC McGregor said the cellist had been playing in the square for an hour before he was asked to stop playing by the guitarist. He said: ‘I was best placed to deal with the situation and stepped in to calm him down. ‘He has now been dealt with by means of a penalty notice.’ Mr Scofield said: ‘I politely asked the cello player to move on because I had a permit to play the square and he continued playing. ‘He said he wasn't moving and asked whether I was going to perform over him. ‘I then began to play my guitar in the same area and it wasn't long before he had chucked water over me. ‘He then said it was obvious I wasn't from the local area. I have played in Bridport at least 10 times in the past and things like this do not happen often.’ Local councillor Daryl Turner, who had been having a chat with PC McGregor, stepped in to help him. He said: 'I saw and spoke to the cello player a few minutes before it happened. 'He was playing some really nice, quite classical music. I had never seen him before. 'After a while I became aware of this altercation and then a splashing sound. 'With that I saw PC McGregor struggling to bring the cello player to the ground and handcuff him. I stepped in along with somebody else to help hold him down. 'After that I picked up the guy's cello and equipment and took it into the arts centre for safekeeping. 'I saw the guitarist who was soaking wet. He went away, dried off and came back and carried on. 'About an hour later, the cello player came back and he was very calm and he appreciated what we did to him in the end.' Sarah Cross, who works in a hairdressers nearby, said: ‘The guy with the cello was there first and then another busker came along and asked him to move on. ‘The next thing, I heard a big splash and then saw the policeman and a couple of people tussling with one of the two buskers. ‘I saw the other busker and he was completely drenched. But he just moved into the sun to dry out and carried on playing his guitar.’ One eye witness later wrote on Facebook: ‘I saw it all - a right old dueling banjos and no mistake. I guess the two buskers involved just struck the wrong chord.’ A spokesman for Dorset police confirmed a 45-year-old man had been issued with an on-the-spot fine of £90 for a public order offence.","A cellist lost his temper with a rival busker in Bridport, Dorset .

"By . Matthew Blake . It is the size of a strawberry and weighs a bit less than three pound coins. But if you had this rare  blue beauty in your pocket you would be carrying around a diamond that could be worth more than £60million. The ‘exceptional’ 122.5-carat  blue diamond was unearthed at the Cullinan mine in South Africa which is renowned for producing giant gems. Rare gem: Petra Diamonds Ltd said it had recovered the 'exceptional' 122.52-carat gem (pictured from two angles) at its Cullinan mine in South Africa . Sparkler: The jewel, about the size of a strawberry (pictured), is so pure that it is expected to eclipse the current world's most expensive diamond - a 507-carat white diamond dug from the same mine that sold for £20 million in 2010 . A blue stone from the mine fetched . £508,000 per carat earlier this year. If this much larger one achieves a . similar valuation, it would command a price tag of £62million – . smashing the record price paid for a rough stone. Anyone . who buys it, however, will be hoping for better luck than the owners of . the famous deep blue Hope Diamond. It supposedly puts a curse on those . who possess it, as the guillotined Louis XVI and his wife Marie . Antoinette discovered. The . newly discovered diamond was dug up by Jersey-based Petra Diamonds at . its mine near Pretoria. One industry insider said it was almost unheard . of to find a blue stone weighing more than 100 carats. Diamond mine: Other notable diamonds discovered at the Cullinan mine (pictured) are the 25.5 carat Cullinan blue diamond found in 2013 and sold for £10 million ($16.9 million), and the Star of Josephine diamond found in 2008 and sold for £5.59 million ($9.49 million) Rough diamond: It comes months after Petra sold a 29.6 carat blue diamond (pictured) from the same mine for more than $25 million . Rough to royalty: A miner holds the Cullinan Diamond shortly after it was found in 1907 (left) before it was cut in two and used for the British Crown and Sceptre (pictured on the head of Queen Elizabeth II in 2009) A . carat is equal to one-fifth of a gram, so Petra’s 122.5-carat stone is . about 25g. In comparison, the average centrepiece diamond on an . engagement ring weighs about one carat and is usually white. Shares in Petra rose nearly 8 per cent on the find yesterday, adding some £66million to the value of the company in a day. The 45-carat blue Hope Diamond, which is said to put a curse on its owner, is worth more than £200million. It is thought to have been stolen in 1653 in India from a statue of Hindu goddess Sita by Jean Baptiste Tavernier, who was reported to have been killed by rabid dogs at the age of 84. The diamond is also known as Le Bijou du Roi, or The King’s Jewel, and was owned by Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette who were guillotined in 1793 by the French revolutionaries. It is then thought to have been smuggled to London. Lord Francis Hope, after whose family it is named, had to sell it in 1894 after going bankrupt. Another supposed victim, Prince Ivan Kanitovski, was killed by Russian revolutionaries. Today it is in the Smithsonian natural history museum in Washington. The . current record price for a rough stone was set by Petra’s sale of the . 507-carat Cullinan Heritage, a white diamond, in 2010 for nearly . £21million.
