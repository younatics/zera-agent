A McDonald's worker who super-sized herself by eating Big Macs twice a day has lost eight stone after switching to the salad bar. Teresa Mayhew, 25, from South Wales, loved to tuck in to free portions of burger and chips while at work, routinely eating her employer's high-calorie food for both breakfast and lunch, followed by a takeaway kebab or pizza for dinner. And in just a couple of years her weight doubled to more than 19 stone, forcing her to get bigger and bigger standard issue beige and brown uniforms, until she was wearing a size 26.

She said: 'I was loving the food we sell at McDonalds - I just kept eating and eating. 'We're allowed to have free food. So I'd eat that when I had a break and then when I got home I'd have more food - pizza, chips, kebabs. 'I didn't really know when I was full so it was easy to keep on going.' Teresa refused to weigh herself for two years, and when she eventually plucked up courage she watched in horror as the needle on the scale went to 19 stone 2lbs.

'I'd see other people wearing nice clothes and think, ""I want to be like that"".' Teresa, from the village of Pentre in the Rhondda Valleys, South Wales, joined a Weight Watchers slimming club and was told to drop burgers from her diet. So instead of eating fat-packed double cheese burgers for lunch, Teresa started opting for salads.

And at home she started cooking healthy meals for herself while her family carried on tucking into takeaways and chips.

Long term problem: Head of MI5 Sir Jonathan Evans has said that spies are often tempted to cut corners in order to catch terrorists . New recruits to MI5 have been warned to behave within the law in order to maintain the public's trust in the security service. MI5 head Sir Jonathan Evans claimed that many spies were tempted to 'cut corners' in their attempts to bring terrorists threatening the UK to justice. The Director General of the intelligence agency said he had to warn spies to behave proportionally, ethically and legally to keep the the trust of both members of the public and ministers, and that cutting corners could result in longer term problems for the service. His comments came amid plans for secret courts that will allow evidence from the intelligence services to be heard privately, despite criticism from senior lawyers and former Army officers. The Justice and Security Bill, which would create new legal powers to keep many official dealings hidden and allow civil court cases involving national security to be heard behind closed doors, is being put forward by the Government. However, critics have said that the bill would allow intelligence officers involved in or with knowledge of torture and rendition to escape public scrutiny. Ministers have argued that foreign organisations such as the CIA have cut back on the amount of intelligence shared with Britain because it is feared it may be disclosed in open court. In an interview to be aired on BBC Radio 4 Sir Jonathan, who was made a KCB in the 2013 New Year's honours list, said that MI5 must be seen to be acting ethically. 'One of the things I say always to new members of the Service is that there may be a temptation to cut those corners but in the longer term that will be a real problem to us,' he said in an extract of the programme given to the Daily Telegraph newspaper. 'We depend on the support of government . and ultimately on the support of the British people to do the sort of . things that we do.' In the two-part series, In Defence of Bureaucracy, Sir Jonathan said that the public should feel confident that spies were acting legally and in accordance with ethical standards. He . also told the programme, presented by former Cabinet Secretary Lord Gus . O'Donnell, that bureaucracy helped officers to carry out their jobs . because they knew that by acting within the law they would be acting . proportionately. The series, which starts on Tuesday at 9am, also features former Deputy Prime Minister Michael . Heseltine and Sir Antony Jay, one of the . co-authors of the iconic comedy series Yes, Prime Minister.

Cuadrilla, the firm behind the only exploratory dig to date near Blackpool, plans to drill a 3,000 feet deep well near the village of Balcombe in West Sussex. In 2011, the company was forced to suspend activities in Lancashire after fracking - blasting underground rock to release trapped pockets of shale gas - was suspected of causing two small earthquakes. The Cuadrilla shale fracking facility in Preston, Lancashire, last year . In the face of strong local opposition, it has given an 'unequivocal assurance' it will not use fracking at the exploratory well. But it could be extended horizontally underground by 2,500ft and is intended to discover how much recoverable gas is below the Sussex countryside. 'Although this summer's work will be unobtrusive, we're fully aware that local people will have many questions about our plans and we'll do our best to answer all of them,' said Francis Egan, Cuadrilla's chief executive. 'During the coming months, we will discuss our plans with residents and they will be able to visit the site to see for themselves what our work involves.' Cuadrilla, which won planning permission for the work in 2010, promised to hold extensive technical, environmental and public consultations if oil or gas are found. It would have to apply for a new licence - and win over suspicious locals - if it intends to frack the site in the future. The technique is a way to retrieve gas trapped in underground rock by injecting high-pressure water and chemicals, but so far has only been widely successful in the U.S. In the next few weeks, an official report by the British Geological Survey is set to be released and expected to announce Britain's shale gas deposits are far larger than previously predicted. Controversial: Demonstrators hold placards in protest against hydraulic fracturing for shale gas outside the Houses of Parliament in London . Industry experts estimate we could be sitting on enough gas reserves to supply the nation for more than a century, fuelling hopes the UKs energy landscape can be transformed like the U.S., where drilling has driven down prices. David Cameron wants to see Britain at the heart of the 'shale gas revolution', and the chancellor has pledged to offer lucrative tax breaks and a simplified regulatory regime to the industry in a bid to promote investment. Fracking was temporarily halted at Britain's only test drill site in 2011, after two small tremors woke some residents in Blackpool. But operations were allowed to resume in December after Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced greater restrictions aimed at limiting the likelihood of tremors. Critics say any shale gas energy boom will scar the countryside, pollute water supplies and could line the pockets of foreign firms rather than boosting the British economy.","Cuadrilla plans to drill well near village of Balcombe in West Sussex .

Experts have called for the HPV vaccine to be offered to gay men as a way of curbing cancer rates. The UK vaccination programme against the HPV infection began in 2008, but only among girls, on the grounds that this would curb the spread of the infection to boys as well. But doctors at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Homerton University Hospital, and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, said gay men are more than 15 times as likely to develop genital cancer as a result of becoming infected with HPV. The UK vaccination programme against HPV began in 2008, but only among girls, on the grounds that this would help to curb the spread of infection to boys too . While rates of anal cancers are higher among men who are also HIV positive - despite antiretroviral treatment - they are also higher among gay men who have not been infected with HIV, said the authors. Australian research has shown that HPV vaccination of girls has had an impact on the rates of genital warts in heterosexual men, but that there has been no such change in prevalence among gay men, according to a report by MedicalXpress. Recent research has shown that the HPV jab is effective in men, including gay men. The vaccine covers HPV 16 and 18, the two strains of the virus which cause most of the cancers associated with the infection. HPV causes genital warts and is associated with a higher risk of genital as well as head and neck cancers . The vaccine is most effective in those who are not already infected with these strains of HPV, but evidence has shown that only a minority of young gay men are, and that the strategy to vaccinate a group that includes those who have already been exposed to these strains is cost effective. Data from the UK's Health Protection Agency (now part of Public Health England) has shown that fewer than one in 20 men under the age of 25 has been infected by any high risk HPV strain. In 2010, 17,000 gay men between the ages of 16 and 26 visited sexual health clinics in England. Experts said that HPV vaccination would help prioritise initiatives to improve access to services for this group, who remain vulnerable to HIV infection. 'In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of universal vaccination of boys, the argument for introducing targeted HPV vaccination for [men who have sex with men] up to age 26 years is strong,' they concluded. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is spread through sexual contact and is more usually associated with cervical cancer in women. It is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. HPV can be passed between men and women by genital contact, most often during vaginal and anal sex. It may also be passed on during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact. It can be passed on between straight and same-sex partners—even when the infected person has no signs or symptoms. The cervical cancer jab given to 12 and 13-year-old schoolgirls aims to cut their odds of the cancer by protecting them against the virus. Although most mouth and throat cancers are normally blamed on drinking and smoking an increasing number of cases that occur around the tonsils and back of the tongue are due to HPV. Although the cancer is not contagious, the virus is. In the US, HPV is blamed for up to 80 per cent of these tumours of the tonsils and the back of the tongue, which experts say could be due to increasing popularity of oral sex. The typical patient is described as an otherwise healthy man in his late 40s or early 50s who has never smoked or smoked very little. In Britain, the number of mouth and throat cancers have increased by 40 per cent in just a decade, to 6,200 cases a year. Cancer Research UK says the HPV virus may be key to the ‘rapid rise’. Symptoms include persistent mouth ulcers, pain, discoloured patches and difficulty chewing and swallowing. Men are advised to check their neck for lumps when shaving and both sexes to look at the back of their throat while brushing their teeth. Treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are often more successful in mouth and throat cancers caused by the virus than those caused by tobacco and alcohol. Although mouth cancer can be caused by HPV passed on by oral sex, doctors say Michael Douglas’s claim that oral sex is also a cure doesn’t make any medical sense.","Doctors at the the Royal Liverpool .

"By . James Slack, Michael Seamark and Fay Schlesinger . UPDATED: . 17:12 EST, 1 July 2011 . Intelligence job: Mohammed Al-Byati at his home in a leafy suburb of Birmingham, where he claimed he was only doing his job as a doctor when working for Saddam Hussein . A doctor involved in horrific torture by Saddam Hussein’s henchmen is working in British hospitals. In an astonishing immigration scandal, border officials have allowed the suspected war criminal to treat thousands of British patients. Dr Mohammed Kassim Al-Byati was given a permit to work as a doctor in the NHS by the Labour government in 2004. Checks failed to uncover his history of working for the notorious Iraqi Intelligence Agency, which ran the country in a reign of terror during the Saddam years. His job was to patch up torture victims so that they could be subjected to more appalling treatment. In 2007, Al-Byati contacted the Home Office to confess to his  horrific past so that he could  claim asylum. But, incredibly, this did not prevent him from  carrying on earning tens of thousands of pounds working at a hospital in Wales. Even now, despite his file being referred to a specialist war crimes unit, he remains cleared by the General Medical Council, and has been working in the West Midlands. The details have only now been unearthed by Home Secretary Theresa May, who was ‘horrified’ to discover what had been taking place. She has ordered an urgent inquiry, and is planning changes to the rules to stop any similar cases slipping through the net. There will also be a shake-up of the UK Border Agency war crimes unit.Whitehall sources say the case shows the total shambles which UKBA became under Labour. At its heart lies the Human  Rights Act and a little-known EU directive which permitted the doctor to work even when his past  was known. Reign of terror: Saddam Hussein . It follows the controversy earlier this week of UKBA failing to stop a banned extremist, Raed Salah, from entering the country. Under Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime countless Iraqis were tortured, maimed and imprisoned. Favoured methods used by his secret police included eye-gouging; piercing of hands with an electric drill; suspension from a ceiling; electric shock; rape and other forms of sexual abuse; beating of the soles of feet; mock executions; extinguishing cigarettes on the body, and acid baths. A case history seen by the Mail shows that Al-Byati arrived in Britain on a six-month visitor visa in January 2000, nine years after the end of the first Gulf War which left Saddam in power. Officials twice extended his leave to stay so he could undertake clinical attachments as a doctor. In January 2004, by which time Iraq had been invaded again, a work permit was granted and he was employed at a hospital in Wolverhampton until February 2007. At this point, Al-Byati claimed asylum. In his witness statement he says he worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Agency. In March 2007, while being interviewed by UKBA, Al-Byati stated that he patched people up after torture and was aware that the victims were returning to torture, but did not feel he could do anything about it. A month later, his file was referred to the war crimes unit. In 2008, he applied for permission to work as he had the offer of a four-month contract with a hospital in Wales. Normally, asylum seekers are barred from working. But there is an EU directive that allows an asylum seeker to work if the case has not been dealt with for 12 months or more through no fault of their own. As a result, since 2008 Al-Byati has been working full-time as a locum registrar and occasionally as a consultant in the West Midlands. The scandal was unearthed because UKBA has just given advice to its chief executive that Al-Byati should be granted leave to remain, or asylum. At this point, the stunned Home Secretary was made aware of what was happening. Leave to remain has not been granted. Horrendous: Iraqi intelligence officials were responsible for the appalling torture of thousands of Saddam Hussein's opponents (file picture from Iraq) A senior source said: ‘The Home Secretary was horrified to find out that this has been allowed to carry on for so long. She dragged the acting chief executive into her office and he got the hairdryer treatment.’ The source continued: ‘We always knew that Labour let the immigration system get out of control but we were genuinely stunned. The Home Secretary is seriously considering having a review of the way the entire agency works.’ The Home Secretary has also been demanding answers from the GMC, which is supposed to check a doctor’s background, but has been frustrated by slow response. One perversity of the asylum system is that the worse the crimes an applicant has been involved in, the more likely he is to be allowed to stay. He can claim that, if sent back to the country where the offences were committed, he may be subjected to degrading treatment, which is not allowed under the Human Rights Act. In the past some asylum seekers have made their past exploits sound worse to bolster their case. A report last year branded Britain a ‘safe haven’ for war criminals with hundreds of people wanted for murder and torture living here free from prosecution. The GMC said last night: ‘We have recently become aware of concerns regarding this doctor.’ By Fay SchlesingerMohammed Kassim Al-Byati last night told how he witnessed the horrifying injuries inflicted by Saddam Hussein’s henchmen – before patching up the victims and leaving them in the hands of their tormentors. Sitting in the living room of the detached four-bedroom house he shares with his wife and three children in a leafy suburb of Birmingham, the grossly overweight doctor launched into a staunch defence of his actions. With Wimbledon showing on the television screen beside him, he insisted: ‘What I have done was my normal doctor duty...which I am doing here (in Britain) every minute.’ Since 2002, Al-Byati says he has worked at hospitals across the country, including Wolverhampton, Solihull, Blackpool, Manchester, Ipswich and Llandudno. Specialising in rheumatology, the senior registrar works as a locum and runs clinics for thousands of unsuspecting British patients, who had no idea of the role he played in Saddam’s brutal regime. In 1992, aged 27, he was party to the  Iraqi regime’s deadly treatment of prisoners in Baghdad. Al-Byati, now 46, worked for the country’s secret intelligence unit for 15 months after qualifying as a junior doctor. It was part of the military service required by the regime, and Al-Byati claims he ‘had no choice’ over the matter. The intelligence agency had a top-security prison in Kadhimiya, where Saddam was eventually executed in 2006. It was there that Al-Byati was taken when the vicious guards realised they had gone too far and risked having a death on their hands. Speaking to the Mail last night, the doctor at first tried to play down the extent of the prisoners’ injuries. He said: ‘There were some bruises, some cuts.’ But on further probing, he admitted that three men he treated had been left ‘for one or two days’ without treatment after vicious beatings. Defiant: Saddam Hussein was executed in 2006 after a trial in which he was accused of a number of horrific crimes including murder and torture . He said: ‘There were some bruises, some cut wounds, mostly on the arms. Not with a knife, probably with a wood thing. 'Not bleeding much because it was one day, two days before they called me. They looked like somebody who had a big accident. ‘There are two men with you and the prisoner can’t even look at you. I can’t do more than dressing, only simple suturing. 'I said two people need to be transferred to hospital. ‘What’s going to happen after that? Are they going to torture them? I would say yes but I  haven’t seen with my own eyes. It’s just assumption.’ Asked whether he thought the prisoners had survived, Al-Byati said: ‘They were alive when I left,’ and then laughed. The doctor said he would have been killed or his family harmed if he had tried to alert humanitarian groups. He told no one, and continued working in Baghdad until 1995, before departing for Jordan and then Libya. In 2000 he moved to the UK to complete British medical qualifications, and then worked in hospitals as a well-paid registrar. Everything was going swimmingly until 2007, he said, when his visa lapsed and the Home Office blocked his application for a replacement. So Al-Byati decided to apply for asylum, on the grounds that the lives of his wife Yousra and children, now aged seven, 12 and 17, will be at risk if they are forced to return to Iraq. From 2007, Al-Byati could not work for a year, he said, but was able to claim benefits and a council house. He then applied for a work permit and it was granted. He said: ‘The money as a locum is very good. I have not worked for the past three months but I have saved.’ But Al-Byati said life now is ‘very difficult’. He said: ‘I can’t go out of this country. I want to see my 70-year-old mother and my brother in America. My wife has family in Jordan, she wants to go there. But we have no passport. It’s like my wife and children are in prison. ‘I can’t get a job, I can’t progress. To be honest, I’m very upset.’ Al-Byati said he does not consider himself to be a war criminal or to have colluded in the atrocities. Neither does he regret the 15 months he worked for the secret service. His message to the Home Office is unequivocal: ‘If you think I’m a collaborator, reject me. I’ve been in this country for 11 years. If anything was wrong they would refuse my application at the first time. ‘I’ve done my job as a doctor, nothing more. So if you think that treating people who were tortured was a crime, it’s up to you. For me, I was the one who was helping them.’","Dr Mohammed Kassim Al-Byati given a permit to work in NHS by Labour in 2004 .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . PUBLISHED: . 09:20 EST, 18 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:08 EST, 18 July 2013 . Sports psychologist Dr Bob Rotella has delivered a 10-point guide to winning The Open on the MailOnline. Looking through the list, no wonder Rory McIlroy is so keen to see him or a fellow shrink. Scrolling down Rotella’s commandments, McIlroy currently meets barely one. Over the past six years we’ve seen many different emotions from the  mercurial Northern Irishman. We’ve seen him exultant, frustrated, angry, despairing, overjoyed and resigned. But we’ve never seen him quite like he was here, when he stood in front of a media throng and, looking thoroughly lost, admitted he needed help. And people thought Wayne Rooney was confused. Scroll down for video . Looking glum: Rory McIlroy suffered a nightmare start in his quest to win the Open . In the rough: McIlroy attempts to play out of trouble on the 14th . Beached: Caught in the bunker, McIlroy attempts to recover with a shot on the green . Psychologist Bob Rotella spoke to Sportsmail on the eve of the Open. Now read his detailed 10-point plan towards winning at Muirfield. What a truly compelling first round . this was at The Open, where drama walked arm in arm with controversy and . excitement and anger stared each other in the face. Amid all the noise about an unfair . course set-up and silly pin positions, it shouldn’t be forgotten that . former Masters champion Zach Johnson shot 66 in the morning to lead . after day one and 56-year-old Mark O’Meara came in with a 67 in the . afternoon. Tiger Woods, showing once more his . relish for parched links courses — the only time he has won outside  St . Andrews was at burnished Hoylake in 2006 — delivered a masterclass of . patience and craft for a 69. How bad, then, could it have been? Pretty bad for Justin Rose and Graeme McDowell, who shot 75, and . terribly bad for Luke Donald, who won’t be getting off the mark in . majors here after blowing his chance with an 80. Rare relief: McIlroy takes a break (left) during the opening round where the world No 2 struggled . Tough day: McIlroy and his caddie look on during the opening round at Muirfield . Frustration: Walking up the fairway, McIlroy adjusts his cap and cuts a dejected figure . And then there was the man in the . middle of a Muirfield maelstrom, for whom it was as bad as it could . possibly be following a 79 that included a horrendous back nine of 42 . shots. Wouldn’t you know it — McIlroy, the game’s most sublime talent, . had tied Sir Nick Faldo, celebrating his 56th birthday and playing his . first event for three years. Just to complete Rory’s day, after he . had conducted an admirably candid interview, who should he bump into . outside the clubhouse but Faldo, the man who told him to ‘concentrate on . golf.’ Faldo claimed to be a friend of McIlroy’s but the fact is the . pair never have anything more than a perfunctory conversation from one . month to the next. Here, they shuffled off in opposite directions . without a word exchanged. JAN 20: Misses cut and finishes tied 98th at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. MARCH 3: Walks off the course at the Honda Classic in the second round. He is seven over par but cites toothache as the reason for his withdrawal. MARCH 24: Loses his world No 1 ranking to Tiger Woods. JUNE 30: Just two weeks after finishing 14 over par at the US Open in joint 41st, misses cut at the Irish Open. JULY 18: Shoots a 79 to finish the first day of the Open at eight over, and admits he is struggling with the mental side of his game. Looking at Rotella’s 10 points, it is hard to see where McIlroy could answer in the affirmative. Point six, for example: Mental toughness and emotional resilience will see you through. Right now, Rory has neither. Point eight: Be decisive and totally committed to every shot you play. Are you kidding? If truth be told, all Rotella’s points are basic . common sense, which is one of the reasons why McIlroy hasn’t seen him in . years. When he’s at his best and it’s all natural and instinctive and . he hasn’t a care in the world, there’s nothing any sports quack could . tell him. But it’s not just his new driver that . is pear-shaped these days. Off the course there are two lawsuits . nagging away at a usually untroubled mind. Is it really beneficial to . have his long-time coach Michael Bannon travelling everywhere and . whispering technical sweet-nothings into his ear each day on the . practice ground? Has the jet-set lifestyle played its part in bringing . him to the point of this astonishing confession? Keeping pace: Nick Faldo also finished his opening round eight over par . Eye on the ball: Faldo tees off on the fourth at Muirfield . Inspection: Taking a moment to think, Faldo walks on the 11th green . ‘BRAIN DEAD’ It’s just so brain dead. Seriously, I feel like I’ve been walking around out there like that for the last couple of months. I’m trying to get out of it. I just don’t quite know why. ‘I’M UNCONSCIOUS’ It’s nothing to do with technique. It’s all mental out there. And then I just need to concentrate, obviously. But sometimes I feel like I’m walkingaround out there and I’m unconscious. I just need to try to think more. ‘ALIEN FEELING’ It’s a very alien feeling, it’s something I’ve never felt before. ‘I’LL SEE A SHRINK’Yeah, I’ve worked with Bob (Rotella, sports psychologist) before a little bit. And, yeah, it could be beneficial to see someone likethat again, we’ll see. They are all things McIlroy will . surely consider as he returns to the drawing board and tries to address a . slump that is moving rapidly from the ‘these things happen in golf’ stage to something approaching genuinely worrying. Tom Watson talks . about golfers being at their best when all they hear is a perfect . silence but McIlroy can’t think straight these days because of the . almighty racket. And is he overthinking matters? ‘Overthinking off the course and underthinking on it,’ said McIlroy, ruefully. His body language is terrible. Every . small blow and he looks like a man who’d rather be anywhere but on a . golf course. At the 15th, he putted from just off the front of the green . into a bunker that protects the back of it. As he said: ‘Just so . thoughtless, so brain dead.’ Dr Gio Valente, the sports . psychologist who has done so much to bolster Rose’s self-belief, thinks . McIlroy needs to follow through on seeking help as a matter of urgency. Of course he would say that, you might think, but he makes some . interesting points. Not going to plan: McIlroy looks on after playing a shot . Look away now: Hiding behind his cap, McIlroy reacts after playing a shot . ‘I have watched Rory a lot since he . got to world No 1 and what I would say is that while he has a terrific . game and can hit superb shots I am not sure he has the mental tools at . this stage,’ he said. ‘I think 100 per cent he needs help on the mental . side of the game. ‘When he has confidence he is a . brilliant player, but when it goes wrong I don’t think he has learned . the mental processes that can protect his confidence. With Justin, he . won the US Open a few weeks after missing the cut at the Players’ Championship. He has learned to protect his confidence. Rory doesn’t . seem to have that skill.’ McIlroy’s demise was the lowlight of a . disappointing day in general for the vaunted home challenge. Rose can . be excused, for the first round after the excitement of winning your . first major is never easy, and he actually played well for much of that . round before, in his own words ‘letting it get away from him.’ As for Donald, this was a savage . setback after playing so well in the last major at Merion. Even Ian . Poulter, going along so well at two under par after 13 holes, was an . angry man after bogeying four of his last five holes for a 73. Indeed, not one of the 13 players who . broke 70 were from these British Isles. A day to forget then — but . McIlroy’s meltdown will live in the memory.

Jack Lew has apparently ditched his circular signature in favor of something much more befitting of the U.S. treasury secretary. Lew, who was appointed to the post earlier this year, created a media stir when his autograph - a series of loops that look nothing like his name - was revealed as the one that would grace all American paper money. But last week, a document from the Financial Stability Oversight Council showed Lew's signature to be legible, with a more pronounced 'J' and 'L.' Clarity: Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's new signature was revealed in a Financial Stability and Oversight Committee document last week . Loopy: Lew's old signature was just a series of circles that looked nothing like his name . Scrawl: President Obama joked that Jack Lew's loopy signature could devalue the national currency at Lew's nomination in January . The change was first noticed by the Wall Street Journal. It is not known whether Lew took any handwriting or calligraphy classes in order to improve his signature. The U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately respond to an email from MailOnline for comment. When he was appointed to the post by Obama in January, even the president took a dig at Lew's scrawl. Obama joked that it he had considered abandoning Lew's nomination after learning of his illegible signature, and added that it could become an international embarrassment. He added: 'Jack assures me that he is going to . work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our . currency should he be confirmed as secretary of the Treasury.' Money matters? If Lew kept the old signature, it would have looked like this on the dollar bill . Lew . also poked fun at himself, saying that he and his predecessor, Timothy Geithner, have both struggled with signage. He . said that 'it was only yesterday that I discovered that we both share a . common challenge with penmanship.' Geithner also modified his signature to make it readable on currency. Lew, 57, was managing director for Citigroup from July 2006 until the end of 2008, when he joined the Obama administration as the president's chief of staff. Treasury officials told the Associated Press on Tuesday that Lew still has time before providing his official signature for all of the nation's currency, something that he is expected to do later this year. Common problem: Lew wisecracked that he did not know that he shared a 'common challenge with outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, left, who had a similarly bad signature .

Fresh-faced: Phillip Schofield has revealed details of his wilder 'partying' days when he was a children's presenter for the BBC in the 1980s . He is the smooth-talking television host, whose squeaky-clean reputation has made him a housewives’ favourite. But Phillip Schofield has now hinted for the first time that he dabbled with drugs and has revealed his days of wild partying while working as a children’s presenter for the BBC in the 1980s. The 51-year-old This Morning presenter has claimed he was a ‘lad’ and admitted his frustration at having to curb his wild behaviour as a young man and act ‘like the son of Enid Blyton’ while appearing on Children’s BBC, and later the Saturday morning show, Going Live! Interviewed by his This Morning co-host Holly Willoughby for fashion magazine, Hunger, Schofield was asked how he had managed to hide his ‘dark side’ so well. He replied: ‘It wasn’t a case of hiding it. I did the same as everybody else. I was a lad; we partied a bit, but I didn’t hide anything. It’s just that nobody bothered to look in the right place. ‘You have to remember that doing kids TV then, you were expected to be the son of Enid Blyton, and that was very difficult. ‘Now you can be much more open, and have a proper life. But then, it was almost, “Oh, you’ve got a girlfriend. What type of girl is she?” But my mates and I very quickly realised: don’t go in to central London and have a wild time. ‘By the way, when I say partying, my weakness has always been booze. I never got much into drugs, because I wasn’t very good at it. ‘We were simply getting leathered in Chiswick where we lived at the time. Everybody knew us and nobody was bothered, and nobody would tell. So I got away with it.’ Frustrated: Schofield admitted that as a young presenter he felt pressure to act 'like the son of Enid Blyton' 'Lad': Squeaky clean presenter Phillip Schofield admits he used to go and get 'leathered in Chiswick' with friends . Asked if he had deliberately tried to . portray a ‘whiter than white’ image, he told his co-host: ‘Let me ask . you this: when you met me, you had your preconceived ideas; now you know . me, what do you think?’ Recalling one incident from his . youth, he says that he and a friend spontaneously jetted off to watch . the Berlin Wall being brought down following a drunken lunch in London, . and ended up having dinner with two German prostitutes. ‘We ended up drinking vodka, eating . caviar with a couple of East German hookers,’ he said. ‘We got in the . car and we drove through Checkpoint Charlie with these two East German . hookers, no questions asked. God knows what the children’s television . would have thought!’ Last year, he surprised his two . million Twitter followers by admitting he had chewed cocoa leaves - . which are the raw material for cocaine - during a holiday in Peru. Phillip Schofield, who now has two . children with BBC production assistant Stephanie Lowe, joined the BBC in . September 1985 when he was 23. He was famously the countinuity . announcer for children’s television on the BBC, presenting from what was . described asthe ‘Broom Cupboard’ until 1987 with his puppet sidekick . Gordon the Gopher. His guests included Bruce Forsyth and Tom Jones. Growing old gracefully: Phillip Schofield now presents ITV's This Morning, among other programmes, alongside Holly Willoughby .

He has always maintained a flawless . reputation, and has since gone on to present adult programmes, including . Talking Telephone Numbers. He currently hosts four programmes on ITV, . This Morning, Dancing on Ice, All Star Mr & Mrs and The Cube. However, he has now revealed that he . dislikes the spotless reputation that he has with viewers, suggesting he . has a volatile temper, often using Twitter to hit back at his critics. ‘The thing is, I inadvertently chip . away at this image that I appear to have,’ he said. ‘But, like everyone . else, I have opinions, and I do have a temper. ‘There’s nothing that winds me up . more on Twitter than people who are stupid, and who say the most . ridiculous things. And you have to be very diplomatic. ‘You have stopped me in the past and . said, “don’t swear because all you’re going to do is play their game,” but what I do is follow them, and send them a direct message saying . something that Phillip Schofield would never say! And then I unfollow . them, watch their outrage and block them. ‘I have another secret Twitter . account. Because once you block someone, you can’t see what they’re . saying.

The armed forces will line the streets of London as Baroness Thatcher is given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours, Downing Street said today. A date is yet to be confirmed but the funeral - set to be the biggest farewell staged for a former prime minister since that of Winston Churchill in 1965 - is expected to take place next week. Britain's first and only female prime minister died at the Ritz hotel today, where she been living in recent months after spending Christmas in hospital. Number 10 said a wide range of friends and colleagues are to be invited to the service at St Paul's, which will be followed by a private cremation. The funeral itself will be televised. Some Tory MPs had called for a full state funeral - usually reserved for monarchs - for Lady Thatcher, but she had stated before she died that she did not want one. She told her friend and spokesman Lord Bell that a military fly-past like the one seen at the state funeral held for Winston Churchill would be 'a waste of money'. The day before the funeral the coffin will be transferred to the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster. There will be a short service following its arrival before the coffin rests in the chapel overnight. A Downing Street statement said: 'On the day itself, the streets will be cleared of traffic and the coffin will travel by hearse from the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster to the Church of St Clement Danes, the RAF Chapel, on the Strand. 'At the church the coffin will be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by the King's Troop Royal Artillery. The coffin will then be borne in procession from St Clement Danes to St Paul's Cathedral.' The route from the Church of St Clement Danes will be lined by personnel from the RAF, the Navy and the Army before it is met at St Paul's by a guard of honour. Members of the armed services and pensioners of the Royal Hospital Chelsea will line the steps of St Paul's. Former colleagues, as well as the Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, will be invited.

Lord Bell said: 'She specifically did not want a state funeral and nor did her family. She particularly did not wish to lie in state as she thought that was not appropriate. 'And she didn't want a fly-past as she thought that was a waste of money - somewhat in character you might think. 'She expressed those views to me personally and she will get what she wanted.' 'Not appropriate': Baroness Thatcher said before she died that a military fly-past like the one (left) seen during the state funeral of Winston Churchill (right) in 1965 would be a 'waste of money' Lord Bell's comments came after several Tory MPs said Lady Thatcher should be granted a full state funeral. Baroness Thatcher's spokesman Lord Bell . Alun Cairns of Vale of Glamorgan wrote on Twitter: 'Margaret Thatcher deserves a state funeral after transforming our nation in such a positive way. The changes were never reversed.' Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke said he thought Lady Thatcher should receive a full state funeral but he respected the family's wishes. He said: 'My personal view is that an appropriate celebration of her life would be a state funeral with full honours. However, I understand that her and her family's wishes were not to have that and I respect that.' Should Baroness Thatcher be given a state funeral? The date of the funeral, which will be followed by a private cremation, is yet to be confirmed. A . statement released by Downing Street today said: 'We can announce that, . with the Queen’s consent, Lady Thatcher will receive a ceremonial . funeral with military honours.

A teenage girl was today recovering in hospital from a deadly snake bite after a desperate jungle journey by wheelbarrow, canoe and a rusty lorry. Relatives pushed Sim Pala through muddy jungle tracks on a wheelbarrow, paddled her across rivers by canoe, and loaded her onto an old lorry to get her to a hospital 35 miles away in time to save her life. The incredible journey through some of the world's most inhospitable terrain took seven hours - more than enough time for Sim to have died from the bite of the deadly Papuan Taipan snake, yet somehow she pulled through. Deadly: Sim Pala, 15, from Papua New Guinea endured a desperate seven-hour journey through the jungle to hospital after she was bitten by a taipan snake like the one pictured. (Stock image) Last night, as she sat by Sim's bedside in the Port Moresby General Hospital, in the nation's capital, the 15-year-old's mother, Mabari Pala, told of the journey that had saved her daughter's life. Sim had run down the steps of their home in Karekodobu village, in the Rigo region, to follow her mother, but as she set out on the grassy path the venomous snake sank its fangs into her left foot. The girl ran screaming into her grandfather's house, about 100 yards away, where she explained she had just been bitten by a snake. 'Ten minutes later she was vomiting and started to cough up blood,' said her mother. It was then, without any usable roads in the area, friends and relatives banded together to use whatever means were possible to get Sim to hospital. They were unaware that the snake that had bitten Sim was one of the world's deadliest and victims could die within 30 minutes. 'We put her in a wheelbarrow and pushed her along until we reached the Kemp Welch River,' said Mrs Pala. 'Then we put her in a dinghy and carried her down the river, making several crossings, to a point where we were able to get a ride on a truck.' The Taipan is a genus of large, fast-moving and highly venomous Australasian snakes. Species of this genus possess highly neurotoxic venom with some other toxic constituents which have multiple effects on victims. The venom is known to paralyse victim's nervous system and clot the blood which then blocks blood vessels and uses up clotting factors. Members of this genus are considered to be among the most venomous land snakes based on their murine LD50, an indicator of the toxicity on mice. Apart from venom toxicity, quantities of venom delivered should also be taken into account for the danger posed. A coastal taipan, the kind which bit 15-year-old Sim Pala, is capable of injecting a large quantity of venom due to its large size. Temperament also varies from species to species. The inland taipan is generally shy while the coastal taipan can be quite aggressive when cornered and will actively defend itself. But, she told The National newspaper, the truck could not go far because all roads in the area had been washed away by recent floods. With Sim now in a coma, Mrs Pala and relatives found another wheelbarrow and pushed Sim for a mile to a first aid post, where they were told the teenager needed anti-venom - fast. The group were eventually able to reach another health centre by phone where staff arranged for an ambulance to find its way through damaged roads. Precious minutes ticked away as the group of friends and relatives waited anxiously for the ambulance. When it arrived another bumpy journey began for the young snakebite victim. It was not until 2am that Sim finally arrived at the Port Moresby General Hospital. 'Thanks to the quick actions of her mother, father Pala Pala and other family members, Sim was quickly pumped with Papuan Taipan anti-venom and is alive to tell the story,' the newspaper reported. The taipan is the major cause of snakebite death along the south coast of Papua New Guinea. It can strike with extraordinary speed and accuracy, and often sink its fangs into flesh multiple times. Its venom causes excessive bleeding and paralysis, acute kidney failure and seizing up of the muscles of the heart. In the worst cases death can occur within half an hour. A medical paper advises that people who have been bitten should be kept as immobile as possible and be transported to hospital immediately. 'Bringing this young girl part way on a wheelbarrow was unconventional but it almost certainly saved her life,' said a spokesman for the hospital.","A Papuan Taipan, one of the world's deadliest snakes, bit Sim Pala, 15 .

But now an accommodation website has come up with an unusual solution that allows singletons to save money while seeing the world. Easynest offers travellers the chance to split the cost of their hotel bill - providing they are prepared to share with a total stranger. Holiday heaven...or hell? Easynest allows you to split the cost of a hotel room by sharing with a stranger . Globetrotters set up a profile on the site, indicating their preferred destination and travel date. 'Hosts' - fellow solo travellers who have already booked a room - can then get in touch to see whether they would like to share. Users of the site are encouraged to create interesting and colourful profiles in order to ensure a timely response, and must pay the host directly for their share of the room. According to the website, the service provides 'the opportunity to meet new friends, build your network, create new opportunities, exchange on the city and learn.' But it would seem that not everyone is convinced, including Mail On Sunday Travel Editor, Frank Barrett. 'The idea of making friends on the internet in the interests of thrift has all the appeal of sharing a shower with Psycho's Norman Bates in order to cut down on the water bill,' he said. 'It would be nice to think that the internet was a friendly community of benevolent people keen to help you out. But we know from experience that it's as likely to be populated with people as mad as a French mini-roundabout.' Saving: The website could be the difference between having to plump for a tent (left) instead of a luxury hotel . The new trend for sharing hotel rooms is the latest in a line of purse-friendly solutions for travellers. Couchsurfing, where hosts offer their sofas and spare beds to travellers, has become increasingly popular among younger travellers - and according to Couchsurfing.org, was used by 10.4 million globetrotters last year. Other popular ways to save cash on accommodation include home swapping, where travellers switch homes for a week, and trips based in hostels, monasteries and even pub gardens. Home swapping: If your pied-a-terre is in a lovely enough location, there is a whole world of choice out there for you. Sign up to a swapping website such as Home Base Holidays, and they will put you in touch with a traveller willing to trade their home for yours. You pay an upfront fee of around £30 to use the site, but after that, everything except flights and food is free. Pub camping: Don't expect luxury yurts or private pools - this is camping of the most basic sort. That said, you do get to use all of the pub facilities and you won't have to go far in search of a pie and a pint. UKCampsite.co.uk lists hundreds of pubs which offer camping - many of which are to be found in the UK's most popular holiday spots. Farm B&Bs: Thanks to increasing competition from abroad and rafts of smothering legislation, many farms have been forced to diversify, with many throwing open their doors to travellers. Farmstay.co.uk lists some of the nicest - all of which cost less than a hotel stay. A recent study from network operator EE found that Brits would . consider sharing personal, everyday items if it meant it would . save them some money. From a study of 1,000 Britons, 12 per cent said they'd be willing to share their toothbrush with a friend or family member, and 62 per cent would share deodrant. The research also found that 47 per cent of men would share a towel and 33 per cent would even share a razor.

Women who have yet to meet Mr Right will be able to store their eggs at home as a powder, scientists believe. The freeze-dried eggs could be kept at room temperature, making home storage a cheaper option than paying for eggs to be kept on ice at a fertility clinic. Should the woman want to start a family, she would simply add water, before undergoing IVF, this week’s New Scientist reports. Women who want to have babies later in life could have their eggs dried into a powder, reports the New Scientist . Israeli scientist Amir Arav said: ‘You keep the powder at room temperature for ever - and just add water to bring it back to life.’ Egg freezing is already available to those who aren’t ready to start a family and several hundred British women have their eggs on ice. It was introduced to give cancer patients who face the risk of being left infertile by their treatment, the possibility of still having children later in life. But it is also popular with women who want to advance in their career before becoming mothers or who are waiting to meet Mr Right. Putting eggs on ice costs around £3,500, plus an annual storage fee of £100 to £150. Dr Arav, whose firm Core Dynamics, bills itself as ‘bringing science fiction to life’, envisions beginning by rapidly freezing the eggs until they turn into a glass-like state. The eggs would then be freeze-dried to turn them into a powder. Kept at home in a dark, air-tight container, the egg powder would save a woman the cost of storage at a fertility clinic. So far, he has successfully powdered and rehydrated cells from human umbilical cords. He has also turned cows’ eggs into a powder, with 23 of the 30 eggs freeze-dried surviving the process. Some experts question why women would want to abandon the tried and tested route of egg freezing for one that would save them as little as £100 a year . New Scientist says: ‘In future, women who want to safeguard their fertility may be able to store their eggs at home as powder. ‘To revive them for an attempt at having a baby, all they would need to do is empty the sachet, add water, fertilise with sperm and implant the embryo.’ However, experts question why women would want to abandon the tried and tested route of egg freezing for one that would save them as little as £100 a year. They also query whether women would feel comfortable having their eggs in their kitchen cupboard or in their bedroom cabinet and point out that Dr Arav needs to prove that powdered eggs can be used to produce healthy babies. Professor Claus Andersen, of the University Hospital of Copenhagen in Denmark, said: ‘If the vision is for women to take their freeze-dried eggs home with them, will those eggs deteriorate over time or lose their reproductive potential? ‘The freeze-drying needs to be shown to be as good as the conventional method of freezing under liquid nitrogen and this could take some time.’","New Scientist reports on new freeze-dry method .

A U.S. tourist detained in Aruba in the death of his travel companion has cooperated with investigators and should be immediately released because there is no evidence against him, his defence lawyer said today. Michael Lopez, the Aruban lawyer for Gary Giordano, denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer answering questions about what happened to Robyn Gardner, his companion on a short trip to the Dutch Caribbean island. Giordano, a 50-year-old business owner from Gaithersburg, Maryland, has granted four interviews to investigators and accompanied them twice on visits to the area where he said Gardner disappeared while they went snorkeling, Lopez said in a written statement. Missing: Robyn Gardner disappeared while on holiday in Aruba with 50-year-old Gary Giordano who is being held by police . Suspect: Former wives and girlfriends have complained of how Gary Giordano could become angry and controlling . 'To date, our client has given all . possible cooperation to the investigation,' he said. 'Where our client . has been asked the same question more than once he referred to previous . statements.' Giordano is scheduled to appear before a judge Monday for a detention hearing. Prosecutors plan to ask that he be . held for at least eight more days while authorities continue to . investigate what happened to Gardner. Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein has said that investigators believe the 35-year-old woman from Frederick, Maryland, is dead. 'We cannot deduce that there is hard proof to sustain a demand by the public prosecutor against our client,' Lopez said. The claims from Giordano's lawyer . comes as former wives and girlfriends told how he could not control his . anger and stalked them, even allegedly hiding outside one lover's house . dressed as a deer. Previous lovers have told how he . courted them with his blue-green eyes, tall physique and offers of . cruises and vacations, and his $1.3 million stone mansion in an . upper-class Washington DC suburb. Giordano, a self-employed businessman and twice-divorced father of three sons, has denied any wrongdoing since the disappearance of Ms Gardner, who authorities now believe is dead. Her remains have not been found, despite four days of searching the area where Giordano told officials an ocean current pulled her away as they snorkelled on August 2. Mystery: Ms Gardner was visiting the island with Gary Giordano, who was detained for questioning . Federal involvement: FBI agents searched Giordano's home in Gaithersburg, Maryland on Friday evening . FBI agents combed through Giordano's Gaithersburg, Maryland, home last night. Yesterday, . solicitor general Taco Stein said a pink shirt and black sandals found . during a search of an abandoned phosphate mine - near where Giordano . told authorities Gardner disappeared - did not belong to the woman. Giordano has told authorities that Ms Gardner never made it back to shore after the two became separated. The exact nature of their relationship is not clear, and she had a boyfriend at home in Maryland. Police . said they doubt certain aspects of his story, including whether the . pair went into the water, and say they're seeking witnesses to build . their case against him. Court . records and former romantic interests reveal a man who could be . threatening and who has had several volatile relationships. 'He can't control his anger,' his first wife, Sharon Cohen, wrote in court papers in 2001. Missing: Thirty-five-year-old Robyn Gardner, of Maryland, disappeared on August 2 while on holiday in Aruba . Search: Police said clothes found in the shaft of an old phosphate mine near Baby Beach, Aruba, did not belong to the missing woman . Giordano married Cohen in 1987 and they had three sons, but the relationship deteriorated until they divorced in 2003. At one point, each accused the other . of abuse, with Giordano alleging that his wife struck him in the back . with a steel cooking spoon during a heated argument. She countered that he had a nasty temper, throwing phones, cursing and becoming violent with one of their sons. Giordano apparently struggled with relationships after his first marriage ended. He and his second wife divorced in 2008 after just two years. In the last three years, other women he dated - many of them thin and blond like Ms Gardner - found that their romantic relationships with him turned ugly. One woman accused him of threatening her by saying 'the world would be better off without me' and of secretly videotaping their sexual encounters. The scene: The Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino in Oranjestad, where Ms Gardner and Mr Giordano were reportedly staying during the holiday . The woman met with prosecutors, but told authorities she didn't want to pursue the case. She claimed in court documents that Giordano retaliated by putting revealing photos of her in neighbours' mailboxes. Jeanette Farago, a former neighbour, started dating Giordano around the time of his second divorce. She said Giordano was charismatic but could become angry and possessive, though she said she never felt physically threatened. Once, he wanted to take her on a cruise but became irate when she didn't want to go, she said, a situation Ms Gardner also found herself in, according to a friend. Unsolved: Natalee Holloway was 18 when she vanished on Aruba on holiday in 2005 . Farago said Giordano insisted on having her email password so he could ensure she was not seeing anyone else. If . she said she was going to the grocery store, he would want photographic . proof. Sometimes, she said, he would spy on her and text her details of . her outfit so she knew he was watching. He even hid in the woods behind her home to watch her, dressing in a deer costume, she said. 'He's Mr Perfect,' she said, and then he's 'totally different'. Giordano and Ms Gardner, who is from Frederick, Maryland, arrived in Aruba on July 31 and shared a room at a Marriott hotel. Investigators have surveillance tape of them at a restaurant near Baby Beach, not far from where he says she disappeared while snorkelling. But no witnesses saw them go into the water and police have no knowledge of what else they did on the island. Under Aruban law, which is based on the Dutch legal system, the judge can extend the next detention order for a maximum of eight days at a hearing scheduled for Monday. After that period, prosecutors could ask a judge to order Giordano held for as long as 60 days while they prepare a case, but that would require more substantial evidence. Charges would be filed at the end of the 60 days if prosecutors take the case to court. Aruba has experience dealing with missing person cases following the still unsolved disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway during a high school class trip to the island in 2005. Her remains were never found and the main suspect, Joran van der Sloot, is in jail in Peru on charges of killing a 21-year-old woman last May.","Gary Giordano, 50, being held over disappearance of Robyn Gardner, 35 .

Schoolgirl Ceri Braithwaite was stunned when she opened her satchel in class - and discovered that her pet rabbit had bunny-hopped inside for a nap. The 11-year-old was rummaging inside her bag to find her pencil case when she spotted Nala, her Lionhead rabbit, snuggled up with her exercise books. The furry fugitive caused panic as teachers and pupils rushed to take care of the floppy-eared stowaway which leapt across the classroom after Ceri discovered him. Hopping mad: Ceri Braithwaite had the shock of her life when she arrived at school to find her pet rabbit had hitched a ride in her schoolbag . Stowaway: Pet rabbit Nala had hopped into Ceri's bag as she fed her other pets before heading to school . In a tale similar to the nursery rhyme 'Mary had a Little Lamb', Nala had sneaked into Ceri's bag while she was feeding her three other rabbits at their home in Normanton-Le-Heath, Leicestershire, before she left for school. Astonishingly, Ceri walked to the bus stop and then travelled three miles to Ibstock Community College, unaware that her cheeky pet had hitched a lift. She said: 'I had put my bag down in the garden, where the rabbits were running freely about and Nala must have jumped in. 'I did think my bag was a bit heavy when I stood at the bus stop but I thought it must be because I had a project and some extra homework in there. Surprise visitor: Ceri was rummaging in her bag to find her pencil case when she spotted Nala her Lionhead rabbit snuggled up with her exercise books . Star pupil: Ceri said that Nala was shaking a bit at first but soon calmed down, and her friends enjoyed petting the rabbit . 'I couldn't believe it when I reached in for my pencil case and she jumped out. One girl screamed but most people just laughed - I was so embarrassed. 'Nala was shaking a bit at first but soon calmed down and I think she enjoyed everyone petting her.' Ceri's shocked teacher then called the schoolgirl's mother, Janet Sladen, 49, who came to collect Nala from the school. Snug: Ceri's mother Janet Sladen suspected that Nala had snuck into her daughter's bag to keep warm . The IT project manager admitted that at first she had suspected that Ceri had taken her beloved pet to school with her on purpose. 'When I got the phone call from the school I couldn't believe it, I thought Ceri must have done it deliberately,' she said. 'But then I realised that while the rabbits are outside every morning she leaves her bag out there with them. 'Since she carries a lot of books to school Nala must have just crawled in there in the snug warm with them. 'I think it sent the whole school into hysterics. 'Initially they assumed it was deliberate but when they realised what had happened the whole school went to work to look after Nala. 'They took her to reception for the youngsters to see and grabbed some lettuce from the kitchen to feed her. 'I think Nala is loving the attention, she used to be quite a grumpy rabbit, but now she seems to be basking in the limelight. 'Ceri always lets the rabbits out at 7.30am before she leaves, then catches the bus at eight. 'Then her younger sister Megan brings them all in before she goes to her school.

There has been a 50 per cent rise in the number of Britons donating their organs after death since 2008 (file picture) The number of Britons donating their organs after death has risen by 50 per cent since 2008. There were just over 1,200 donors in 2012, up from 800 four years earlier. The organs they provided allowed the number of transplants to rise to 3,100. The increase has partly been credited to specialist nurses who have difficult conversations with bereaved families about the prospect of their loved one’s organs being donated. There are now 250 organ donation nurses working in hospitals throughout the UK who sensitively approach relatives shortly after patients have died. Despite the rise in donations, Britain still has one of lowest rates in Europe and an estimated 1,000 patients die each year waiting for a transplant. Senior doctors are calling for an overhaul of the system which would see everyone being a potential donor unless they specifically requested otherwise. Ministers are considering introducing the policy in Wales in two years’ time but there are no plans for a similar move in England. Experts are also concerned that some families are overruling patients’ wishes by refusing to allow their organs to be used. Last year there were 125 cases where relatives intervened even though individuals had signed the NHS Organ Donor Register. Although families do not have a right to object, doctors often agree not to take organs to avoid dispute. Experts on the Organ Donation Taskforce, a panel set up by the Government, want a law change to ensure patients’ dying wishes to become donors are always respected. Despite the rise in donations, Britain still has one of lowest rates in Europe and an estimated 1,000 patients die each year waiting for a transplant . The increase has partly been credited to specialist nurses who have difficult conversations with bereaved families about the prospect of their loved one's organs being donated (file picture) The number on the Organ Donor . Register has reached a record 18.6million – nearly one in three of the . population. But the rate of donations is still woefully low compared . with most of Europe. Each . donor has the potential to help up to nine people by giving their heart, . lungs, two kidneys, pancreas, liver, small bowel and two corneas. Elisabeth Buggins, chairman of the Organ Donation Taskforce, said the rise in donations was a ‘phenomenal achievement’. She . added: ‘It’s a very sensitive time for the families. It’s also true . that donor families gain a great deal of comfort in the longer term from . the decision to donate their loved one’s organs. ‘I know families who keep a letter telling them where the organs have gone in their jacket pockets as a comfort they take with them every day.’ Dr Vivienne Nathanson, director of professional activities at the British Medical Association, said: ‘The BMA believes that an opt-out system, as part of an overall package to increase donation, would increase rates even further and save more lives.’ She added: ‘The BMA is very pleased that there has been a 50 per cent increase in deceased organ donation since recommendations were set by the Organ Donation Taskforce in 2008. ‘The whole transplant community has worked tremendously hard to achieve this.’ Sally Johnson, the NHS Blood and Transplant’s director of organ donation and transplantation, said: ‘Although I am delighted that we have made such big advances in the UK, we can and must do more. ‘We need a transformation in donor and family consent to organ  donation because the UK’s family refusal rate remains one of the highest in Europe. ‘Without that, there is only a limited amount more the NHS can do to offer further hope to those on the waiting list for an organ transplant.’ The sharp rise in organ donation is largely due to the creation of a network of specialist nurses who support bereaved families and discuss the possibility of organ donation with them. Specialist nurses are one of a number of recommendations made in 2008 by the Organ Donation Taskforce, following a decade of almost no increase in the number of donated organs. The taskforce also pushed for the creation of specialist organ retrieval teams and wider promotion and campaigning around the importance of organ donation. Giving and taking: The number of organs being donated is at an all time high . These recommendations have led to a sharp increase in organ donors across the UK – a rise of 49 per cent rise in England, of 16 per cent in Wales, of 74 per cent increase in Scotland and an astounding 82 per cent increase in Northern Ireland. Consequently there has been a 31 per cent boost in the number of people receiving a life-saving or enhancing organ transplant since 2008. ‘This is an outstanding achievement that few thought possible at the time this ambition was set,’ said Bill Fullagar, chairman of NHSBT. ‘It is the result of the hard work and dedication of staff in hospitals and communities across the country. ‘We must also share our heartfelt thanks with every family who, at a great time of sadness, supported their loves one's wish to donate their organs and transform the lives of up to nine other people.’ Despite the increase in organ donors, the numbers of families refusing to grant consent remains among the highest in Europe, and NHSBT is calling for more to be done. In addition to this, lack of organ donation awareness amongst the black and Asian community particularly needs to targeted, according to the NHSBT. Despite being three times more likely to need a transplant, only three per cent of this section of the population is on the organ donation register.","The organs provided allowed number of transplants to rise to 3,100 .

Huge amount: Dawn Marsden, 31, can drink up to 28 pints a day, it was revealed in court . She was so drunk during the court hearing that she had to ask a reporter what her sentence was only moments after being given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay compensation of £28.02 and £45 in costs. Marsden's solicitor, John Relton, told magistrates: 'You may have noticed my client has a drink problem. It's something she is seeking advice upon and getting help.

Allegations: Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher (pictured with his wife Nicole Appleton) faces claims from music journalist Liza Ghorbani (right) who says she gave birth to his baby, a girl, according to reports in the U.S. In the article, published in 2010, Gallagher and Ghorbani went to New York’s Ritz-Carlton bar and a private club. She has now hired ‘the best divorce lawyer in New York’ to handle her claim. Newspapers reported earlier this week . that a British rock star was seeking to keep a US love child secret over . fears that his wife would leave him. The reports, which did not name . the singer, said the child’s mother was demanding £2million from him as . well as child support. Millionaire Gallagher, 40, is married . to All Saints singer Nicole Appleton. There was no public reaction from . Miss Appleton, his second wife, while Gallagher’s spokesman refused to . comment on ‘gossip’.

Second wife: There was no public reaction from Miss Appleton, his second wife, while Gallagher¿s spokesman refused to comment on 'gossip' Gallagher fathered a child as a result of an affair during his first marriage. A couple of months after he married . actress Patsy Kensit in April 1997, he had a fling with singer Lisa . Moorish, who gave birth to Molly, now 15, the following year. He and Miss Kensit had a son, Lennon, now 13, in September 1999 and divorced a year later. Gallagher had a son Gene, now 12, in . July 2001 with Miss Appleton.

Miss Ghorbani is said to claim that she gave birth to his daughter less than a year ago.

The New York Post said she was suing . him in the Manhattan Family Court for £2million, in a case listed as . ‘Anonymous vs Anonymous’. It is alleged she is willing to take DNA tests to prove her case and wants Gallagher to pay paternity costs. A friend of the mother said: ‘She has no doubt in her mind he is the dad. ‘She knows who she slept with and when. She isn’t some tart, she’s a successful professional.’ The lawyer representing Miss Ghorbnai . is Bill Beslow, whose previous clients include Robert DeNiro, Nicole .

A boy of four who spoke no English and only a few words of Polish was locked in a room for days at a time in an ‘incomprehensible’ campaign of cruelty, a court was told. Finally, Daniel Pelka was allegedly left for 33 hours to die in his home-made cell after a violent assault. His mother, Magdelena Luczak, 27, said she did not call for paramedics because she feared going to prison. Magdalena Luczak told the jury that Mariusz Krezolek, the stepfather of Daniel Pelka, 'hated' the four-year-old and had given him physical punishments, including squats, almost every day . But she maintained it was not her . fault that Daniel had died, and blamed her former boyfriend, Mariusz . Krezolek, 34, for hitting him on the head. Luczak and Krezolek, who came to . England from Poland in 2006, deny murdering Daniel and causing or . allowing the death of a child at their home in Coventry. The boy was allegedly locked in his . cell with no door handle on the inside, starved and force-fed salt as . punishment for taking food from the fridge. Another child in the family said . Daniel was prevented from using the toilet and pistachios and biscuits . were taken for him when he was not allowed to eat. Daniel was said to . have been so hungry that he ate out of bins and stole his primary school . classmates’ packed lunches. Despite two home visits from school . staff and an appointment with a paediatrician, he was found dead on . March 3 last year weighing 15lb below the average weight for a child of . his age. One expert in child deaths said his body could be compared to that of a child starving in a concentration camp. Toddler Daniel Pelka, 4, who died of head injuries after being found unconscious at his home in Holbrooks, Coventry . Luczak yesterday denied killing . Daniel. ‘I was downstairs in the living room and I heard some screams. Mariusz was shouting at Daniel,’ she told the jury at Birmingham Crown . Court. ‘I went upstairs, Daniel was crying. Mariusz was shouting at him because Daniel wet himself. ‘I told him, “He is in fear of you”. Mariusz hit him in the back of his head and Daniel fell to the front of him,’ she said. Defendants: Magdelena Luczak and Mariusz Krezolek, who are appearing at Birmingham Crown Court accused of killing Luczak's son Daniel Pelka . ‘He grabbed him by the T-shirt and . dragged him to the boxroom, there he hit him again, and he knocked him . down to the mattress, he hit him on the right side of the head. ‘I shouted at him not to hit him on . his head. Because I shouted he grabbed me by the neck to calm me down, I . don’t remember what happened later.’ Luczak said she realised her son . was unconscious at 9am the next morning but didn’t call for help until . 2.45am the following day. ‘I was afraid, they would take away my child and I would be in prison,’ she added. Earlier she insisted she thought . Daniel was being fed well at school, even though he weighed just 1st7lb . when he died in March last year. ‘Mariusz would check his belly and he would say that there’s a slight bump on his belly,’ she said. ‘He would ask Daniel if he was taking . any sandwiches [from his school]. Daniel was so scared that he would . always confess and say yes he had. ‘Mariusz didn’t allow me to give him food and he said he was well fed at school.’ Speaking with the help of a translator, Luczak said she often saw her child eat. ‘In the morning before he left for school, I was giving him breakfast and I was packing his packed lunch. ‘On the way to school I would buy him something sweet and after school Daniel wouldn’t eat any more,’ she said. Luczak claim Daniel was starved because Mariusz Krezolek was preventing her from properly caring for him . Questioned by Stephen Linehan, QC, . defending, Luczak admitted she had not cared for Daniel between . September 2011 and February 10, 2012, three weeks before he died. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told the . court: ‘Daniel was subjected to a campaign of incomprehensible and . escalating cruelty. When doctors tried to measure his BMI (body mass . index) it was too low to be measured on the scale.’ Prosecutors allege that after the . ‘violent assault’ Krezolek wrote in a text message: ‘He’ll get over it . by tomorrow. There’s no point to call the ambulance as that will cause . proper problems.’ He  was pronounced dead at University Hospital in Coventry. He had 24 injuries to his head, body and all four limbs. Tests showed higher than normal sodium levels in his system. The case continues.

A man faces a $102,000 bar tab after being charged with drinking 52 bottles of whiskey dating back to pre-prohibition times. The whiskey was part of a stash of 104 bottles of Old Farm Pure Rye Whiskey found hidden behind a basement staircase at a mansion in Scottdale, Pennsylvania. The manor’s former live-in caretaker John Saunders, 62, was accused of drinking the historic whiskey after his DNA was found on the empty bottles. Former live-in caretaker John Saunders, left, is accused of drinking the historic whiskey which he ex-boss Patricia Hill was planning to give to a local museum . Saunders is accused of drinking half of a stash of 104 bottles of Old Farm Pure Rye Whiskey found hidden behind a basement staircase at a mansion in Scottdale, Pennsylvania . Homeowner Patricia Hill had been planning to donate the whiskey to a local museum and had asked Saunders to ensure that it stayed safe, but instead police say he drank half of it. Saunders has been held for trial on a felony theft charge and a charge of receiving stolen property after Wednesday's hearing. ‘The DNA doesn't lie. I'm just disappointed a family friend of over 40 years has lied,’ Hill told WTAE after testifying against her former employee. According to Scottdale Police Chief Barry Pritts, Saunders denies drinking the whiskey or removing labels from the bottles. It is believed the bottles were hidden away during prohibition times and weren¿t discovered until builders stumbled upon them hidden in the walls and stairwell of the century-old Georgian mansion during renovations in the mid-1990s . John Saunder went through 48 bottles of Old Farm Pure Rye Whiskey, valued at $102,400. The whiskey was made by the West Overton Distiling Co., which distilled rye for more than a century before being closed at the beginning of Prohibition in 1919. The distillery was the family business of the Overholdts, who's name is still attached to one of the most widely available rye whiskeys in the United States. Pre-Prohibition one of their most popular brands was Old Farm Pure Rye Whiskey. Once liquor was legal again, the family sold the Old Overholdt brand to National Distillers. Instead he told police he moved the cases to clean them several times but never opened any of the bottles. ‘Saunders said that the whiskey probably evaporated and being that old, it was probably no good,’ Pritts wrote. A search warrant was issued for Saunders' DNA sample. According to Pritts the sample matched the DNA profile obtained from three of the whiskey bottles. A whiskey appraiser in New York City has estimated the retail value of the missing whiskey at around $102,400. Attorneys agreed . on Wednesday that further expert testimony and evidence will have to be . heard to determine the exact retail value of the whiskey. The whiskey was distilled by the West Overton Distilling Company in 1912 and delivered to industrialist J.P. Brennan in 1917. It . is believed the bottles were hidden away during prohibition times and . weren’t discovered until builders stumbled upon the nine cases hidden in the walls and stairwell of the century-old Georgian mansion during renovations in . the mid-1990s. 'My guess . is that Mr. Brennan ordered 10 cases... pre-Prohibition,’ said Hill, a . New Yorker who bought the house to convert it into a bed-and-breakfast. 'I was told by his family that family members used to greet him at the door each day with a shot of whiskey.' Hill told police Chief Barry Pritts that she had stored the whiskey in the original cases, which contained 12 bottles each. After Saunders moved out, Hill said she discovered last March that the bottles in four cases were empty.

Detectives were last night investigating the murders of three men whose bodies were dumped in ditches five miles apart. Property developer Kevin Lee, 48, was found stabbed to death in a roadside ditch on Saturday. Four days later, two more bodies were found in a remote dyke a short drive away. These men – one in his 30s and one in his 50s – have not been named. Police believe the three murders, which took place in Cambridgeshire, are linked. Arrested: Gary Stretch (left) was arrested along with tattooed lover Joanna Dennehy (right) in Herefordshire . Officers are also connecting the deaths to two separate stabbings which took place on Tuesday in Hereford – some 140 miles from where the bodies were found. Married father Mr Lee, who rented out a number of properties in Peterborough, was last seen on Good Friday. His body was discovered close to nearby Newborough before the other two bodies were found in Thorney, a short drive away. As a nationwide manhunt was launched for Mr Lee’s killer, a man and a woman whom police had been trying to trace were arrested on separate charges of attempted murder in connection with the Hereford attacks, in which two men were stabbed ten minutes apart. One of those arrested, Gary Stretch, was said to be a tenant of Mr Lee’s who was facing eviction. The 47-year-old, who stands at 7ft 3in and was described as looking like the ‘Incredible Hulk’, was last night still being interviewed on suspicion of attempted murder for the Hereford attacks. Dead: Kevin Lee was found knifed to death on Saturday in Newborough, Cambridgeshire . His girlfriend Joanna Dennehy, 30, who was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, was detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. The day after the arrests, police were called by a farmer to say he had found two bodies on private land in Thorney. Mr Lee’s family described his death as a ‘tragic loss’, saying in a statement: ‘We are devastated by Kevin’s death. He was a wonderful husband, father, loving brother and son. ‘His naturally infectious personality touched everyone who knew him.’ His friend Chris Wilson, a plasterer, said: ‘We have no idea why he would be targeted or what has happened. ‘This is not something that we are used to dealing with.’ Julie Gibbons, Stretch’s ex-partner and mother of his teenage children Charlie and Garry, said before his arrest he had been sharing a four-bedroom house with strangers. Last night the three-storey property in Orton Goldhay where Stretch and Dennehy had been living was boarded up. They shared the house, which had been split into bedsits by Mr Lee, with a man called John who was in his 50s and a younger man. A neighbour said: ‘We have had so many problems with that house. The noise, the mess, we have had stuff thrown at our dog. ‘We just had to have our carpet and beds replaced because we had an infestation of bed bugs come from there. Kevin had paid for our house to be fumigated last week.’ An estate agent from Bairstow Eves in Peterborough, which marketed Mr Lee’s properties, said: ‘He was an established landlord. ‘Mr Lee was always friendly and polite with our staff. We never had a problem with him. We’re surprised that someone would want to hurt him.’ The two men stabbed in Hereford were last night still being treated in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. One is described as having serious injuries and the other is in a critical condition. A 32-year-old man and a 23-year-old man arrested in connection with the murder of Mr Lee over the weekend have been released on bail. Leslie Layton, 36, appeared at Peterborough Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday charged with perverting the course of justice. Layton, from Orton Goldhay, was remanded in custody until his next court appearance on Wednesday.

There's nothing quite like mom's cooking, and it would appear that one of the country's biggest fast food chains agrees. Last year, Wendy's unveiled its first new logo since 1983. The burger chain shelved the boxy old Western lettering in favor of a sleeker, modern take on the Wendy's icon coupled with breezy handwritten lettering. If you look carefully, the word 'mom' can be found in Wendy's collar. Everything becomes clear: The word 'mom' is really obvious when the new logo is seen in certain situations, such as this paper cup . Do you see it? The new logo was unveiled in March of this year. It has proved to be a popular refresh, but some have claimed the word 'mom' is written beneath Wendy's collar . Old logo: On this logo from 1983 which was used until this year, Wendy is seen to be wearing a collar. The company say the new logo is simply an update on the tried and tested brand . The word becomes really obvious in single-color versions of the logo, which are used on Wendy's Styrofoam cups. The logo has been steadily rolled out for the last four months and some have noticed a subliminal message in the new logo. Wendy's say that they didn't realize the hidden message within their logo. 'We are aware of this and find it interesting that it appears our Wendy cameo has 'mom' on her ruffled collar. We can assure you it was unintentional,' said a spokesperson from the company.

Most people have a sentimental attachment to at least a few of the dishes their Mother's used to make,' write Stocklogos. 'It should not be a surprise to see the fast food restaurant, Wendy's associating their refreshed brand with Mom's cooking. This is something you may not notice consciously for years, but unconsciously it will leave an imprint on your brain and you will associate it with the brand.'

Dunkin' Donuts is rolling out a revamped design for its coffee houses and if it all looks rather familiar then that’s because it is following the hottest trend in fast food restaurants right now, known as ‘fast casual’. The donut shop's new look retains the bright orange and pink colors of the brand’s logo, but introduces lots of comfortable chairs, plugs for electrical devices and moody lighting. This more sophisticated look has already been introduced by other chains including McDonald’s, Burger King and even Dunkin’s arch rival Starbucks. Dunkin' Donuts is rolling out a revamped design for its coffee houses featuring comfy chairs and plugs for electrical devices . Not so new look: The new Dunkin' designs look a lot like the interiors of arch rival Starbucks (above) The company is banking on the makeover helping it break out of the ‘breakfast-only’ category and start getting customers to think of it as an all-day destination. ‘The modernized design incorporates many new features to create a warm environment for guests who seek a longer, more relaxed visit to Dunkin’ Donuts as part of their day,’ the company said in a release. ‘Fast casual’ is all about fast food restaurants creating more desirable spaces for people who want to do more than simply grab a coffee to go.

You need to have a welcoming atmosphere,’ Hayden told NBC. While most Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants already offer free Wi-Fi, the new designs will also feature flat-panel televisions and satellite music. The new design, is the brand’s first in nearly seven years. Despite their long-running rivalry, Dunkin' Donuts new design appears to owe a lot to that of Starbucks . The new look includes four restaurant design options for franchisees, each featuring variations in layout, color schemes, graphics, textures, furniture and/or lighting. The designs are called: Original Blend, Cappuccino Blend, Dark Roast and Jazz Brew. Franchise owners will be able to select individual elements from any of the four options, to create a restaurant design that best serves their specific restaurant size and location.

Two fraudsters cheated concert promoters out of millions of dollars by pretending to organise gigs by stars such as Rihanna and Lady Gaga, a court has heard. Vincent Carroll and Meceo McEaddy allegedly made more than $2million from production companies around the world which paid them to set up concerts that would never take place. The pair spent their ill-gotten gains on an international luxury lifestyle, splashing out on cars, hotels and expensive jewellery, according to prosecutors in New York. 'Scam': Two men are accused of pretending to organise concerts by Rihanna and Lady Gaga . Carroll, 47, and 38-year-old McEaddy are accused of posing as middlemen with close links to Lady Gaga, Kesha and Rihanna. They were yesterday indicted by the Manhattan district attorney on charges of grand larceny and felony fraud. The alleged scammers are accused of promising Brazilian concert promoters that Rihanna would perform in Rio de Janeiro, and charging an advance fee of $1million. Claims: Another allegation centres around Kesha, who was supposedly booked to perform . They also allegedly agreed that Lady Gaga would perform at a private party in Mexico in exchange for a pavement of $650,000. A third charge read out in court yesterday related to a supposed concert by Kesha, whom Carroll and McEaddy allegedly pretended to represent. District attorney Cy Vance said in the indictment: 'These defendants are charged with selling concert promoters around the world a false bill of goods. 'Rihanna's Please Don't Stop the Music could be an anthem for the legions of disappointed fans who heard about her concert in Brazil, only to learn that it had to be cancelled before tickets even went on sale. 'The defendants capitalised on the popularity of three of the most famous pop stars in the world to steal more than $2million from event promoters. My office will continue to root out and prosecute those who abuse their victims' trust for their own profit.' During the initial court hearing, the judge raised laughter when it emerged that he had not heard of some of the stars mentioned in the scams. When a prosecutor mentioned the fake Rihanna concerts, the judge said: 'Who is this?', according to the New York Post. As Lady Gaga's name cropped up, he said, 'Lady Gaga, I’ve actually heard about - a relative of mine went to the same high school as she did.' However, the judge admitted 'I don't have a clue' about Kesha.","Vincent Carroll and Meceo McEaddy accused of lying to concert promoters .

Sadly, there was no fairytale ending: Jamie could only finish eighth out of 13 riders in the Grand Live Music Venue Handicap flat race.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 18:07 EST, 18 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:58 EST, 19 July 2013 . Five rail bosses are set to receive £11million over three years in an extraordinary deal that critics condemned as rewarding failure. The top executives at Network Rail could share bonuses of £5million on top of their six-figure salaries, despite years of dismal performance and inflation-busting fare rises. The deal was nodded through yesterday. The taxpayer-funded firm is currently facing a £75million fine for missing its punctuality targets for long distance services. Network Rail, a not-for-profit company, has also been dogged by constant complaints over crowded trains and fare rises. Its five bosses were already earning salaries of between £348,000 and £577,000 a year, with annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income. But yesterday a new ‘long-term incentive’ payment was agreed. This additional bonus will be paid at the end of three years and is worth a maximum of a full year’s salary, depending on performance. The new element was rubber-stamped at  the company’s annual general meeting in Cardiff. Over three years chief executive David Higgins could earn £3.1million, made up of his basic salary of £577,000, a long-term bonus worth the same again and potential annual bonuses worth £790,490 over three years. The other four directors will earn between £1.8million and £2.1million over the three-year period if they hit performance targets. Before the vote Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association(TSSA), had written to members – the company’s equivalent to shareholders – urging them to reject the bonus plan. Afterwards, Mr Cortes said the union was ‘bitterly disappointed’ by the plan. ‘Once again public members of Network Rail have put the interests of bosses ahead of passengers,’ he said. ‘These bosses will be on board a very lucrative gravy train while the poor passengers pay through the nose with annual above-inflation fare rises.’ It was voted on by Network Rail’s 44 ‘members’. Their job is to hold the board to account. Top dollar: Financial director Patrick Butcher (left) and Chief Executive David Higgins (right) earn £394,000 and £577,000 respectively. They are to receive £11million over three years with their three fellow executives . Bonuses: The Director of Operations Robin Gisby (left) and strategy director Paul Plummer (right) earn £371,000 and £348,000. Their annual bonuses are worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income . Condemned: Critics say bosses like Simon Kirby (pictured) should not be given the bonuses when they have missed targets and customers are paying more for tickets . But as a company limited by guarantee, its members do not have any financial interest in the company, which is supposed to put its profits back into maintaining the railways. Chief executive of Passenger Focus, Anthony Smith, said: ‘Passengers will wonder why bonuses are being paid if the service is getting worse. ‘We support incentives for improved services, but bonuses should be tied to passenger satisfaction, not be rewards for failure.’ Labour’s transport spokesman, Maria Eagle, also condemned the move. She said: ‘Commuters facing inflation-busting fare rises will be outraged at the scale of the bonus packages being enjoyed by a few at the top of the rail industry. ‘With passengers facing overcrowded services and too many delayed and cancelled trains, it is wrong for Network Rail to be paying out such large sums to its senior managers. ‘It will particularly anger passengers that these bonuses are being paid for a year when Network Rail has failed to meet its own performance target on train punctuality.’ She added that ministers should ‘make it clear that bonuses on this scale are simply not appropriate in a company that receives nearly £4billion of taxpayers’ money every year’. Network Rail has defended the long-term bonus, saying it is intended ‘to recognise outstanding and exceptional performance over the three years to 2015’. It said any future awards would be measured against train performance, savings made for the taxpayer and the successful delivery of congestion easing projects, each of which has ‘tough’ targets. Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones, who does not receive any bonuses, said: ‘Network Rail executives are rewarded only when exceptional performance exceeds tough targets, which have been approved by our members through an open and transparent process. ‘If targets are not met, or safety comprised, no bonuses are made.’ He insisted the firm had made exceptional progress over the past 12 months, with passenger numbers rising to 1.5billion. The annual bonuses scheme already pays bosses up to 60 per cent of their salary provided they meet targets on punctuality as well as train company and passenger satisfaction. Controversial: Network Rail members have approved a fresh lucrative bonus package for its top directors - despite fierce criticism from unions about the firm's performance . But those targets were missed last year, so executives received just 17 per cent rather than the maximum 60 per cent of salary.

President Obama lost his famous cool and 'was spewing coals'  with House Speaker John Boehner during the collapse of a historic spending and debt deal between the two men, a new book has revealed. The Price of Politics by Bob Woodward reveals how close Obama and Boehner were to defying many in Washington by establishing a new framework for spending. But at a key moment in the discussions last summer, with an agreement close, the book says Obama called Boehner to press for additional taxes - only for the entire deal to then collapse and Obama to completely lose his temper. Angry: President Obama, right, lost his famous cool and 'was spewing coals' after losing his temper with House Speaker John Boehner, left, during the collapse of a historic spending and debt deal last summer, a new book has revealed . The President says he raised the . possibility of putting more revenue into the deal. However Boehner  says . the President would have needed an additional $400 billion through tax . reform. According to the book, as reported by ABC News, President Obama called Boehner three times during one day to speak about his latest offer for the deal. But the House Speaker did not return the phone call for most of the day - described in the book by Woodward as a 'monumental communications lapse' between the two men. When the call was finally returned from Boehner, he called off the entire deal after the House Speaker felt he could not come to an agreement with the President. This created a furious reaction from the normally relaxed Obama. One member of staff in the room at the time said Obama gripped the phone so tight he thought it would break. Speaking to Woodward, Boehner said: 'He was spewing coals. He was pissed…. He wasn't going to get a damn dime more out of me. 'He knew how far out on a limb I was. But he was hot. It was clear to me that coming to an agreement with him was not going to happen, and that I had to go to Plan B.' Breakdown: Obama called Boehner three times during one day to speak about his latest offer for the deal. But the House Speaker, right, did not return the phone call for most of the day. Boehner is pictured with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney . The stakes at the time of the secret meetings between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner could not have been any higher. The one-on-one meetings took place as America's leaders were attempting to prevent a default which could have shattered the confidence of financial markets and created a crisis in the world's economy. The secret meetings between President Obama and Mr Boehner were over how to set the federal debt ceiling. They emerged through their joint frustration over progress to reduce the nation's huge debt problems. The budget plan was going nowhere and no solution to the deficit was imminent. The pair held the meetings at the White House in the hope of creating a 'big deal'. However, as the book revealed, the deal between the two men broke down and their relationship soured. Eventually the nation's leaders made a deal to cut spending and extend the nation's debt threshold. However, this will also lead to tax hikes and cuts to programs such as defense spending by the end of this year. Obama's battle with Republicans over fiscal policy dominated the agenda in the White House for much of 2011 and is still unresolved. To this day, both the President and Boehner disagree on the reasons why the deal collapsed at the last minute. President Obama and his staff believe Boehner pulled back from the agreement because of political pressure from the Republican party, saying he took the president's proposal as an excuse to pull out of the talks. But one thing both men agree on is how Obama lost his temper. Speaking to Woodward about the breakdown in negotiations between the two men, Obama said: 'I was pretty angry. 'There's no doubt I thought it was profoundly irresponsible, at that stage, not to call me back immediately and let me know what was going on.' Despite the accusations between the two men now, during the negotiations both men developed a close working relationship. It started with a golf summit and continued with detailed conversations on the Truman balcony and patio outside the Oval Office. Woodwood reports that Boehner would drink red wine and smoke cigarettes while the President drank iced tea and - having quite smoking - chewed on Nicorette. However, revealing how important the debt negotiations were at the time, Obama compared the talks with the decision to launch an attack on Osama bin Laden's compound. The president told Woodward: 'I would . willingly lose an election if I was able to actually resolve this in a . way that was right.' Revelations: The latest book by Bob Woodward, pictured left, called The Price of Politics, right, reveals how close Obama and Boehner were to defying many in Washington by establishing a new framework for spending . Some people close to the negotiations at the time criticised the White House, with one democrat saying the administration did not seen to have a strategy. Boehner was also critical. 'The president was trying to get there. But there was nobody steering the ship underneath him. 'They never had their act together. The president, I think, was ill-served by his team. Nobody in charge, no process. I just don't know how the place works. To this day, I can't tell you how the place works. There's no process for making a decision in this White House. There's nobody in charge.' Once the agreement between the two men fell apart, it was Boehner's 'Plan B' which helped to avoid the country defaulting on its debt for the first time, the book reports. Temper: When the deal between Boehner and Obama collapsed, the President, is said to have gripped the phone so tight a member of staff thought it would break. Obama is pictured with former President Bill Clinton . It led to the President being excluded from many of the key discussions as congressional leaders worked on a late framework to avoid a major financial crisis. With no agreement made and pressure increasing, the book says David Krone, the chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, told the president directly 'It is really disheartening that you, that this White House did not have a Plan B.' Eventually a deal was made to cut spending and extend the nation's debt threshold. However, this will also lead to tax hikes and cuts to programs such as defense spending by the end of this year.","The Price of Politics by Bob Woodward reveals how close Obama and Boehner were to establishing a new historic debt deal .

"By . Toby Harnden In Charlotte, North Carolina . PUBLISHED: . 03:23 EST, 6 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:16 EST, 6 September 2012 . Former President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday that his wife says she won't run for the White House in 2016 - but mischievously said he didn't have 'any idea' if she was telling the truth. 'You know, she — we're not kids any more,' he told NBC shortly before taking to the stage for his big speech at the Democratic convention on Charlotte. 'I don't have any idea if she'll ever run again,"" Clinton said. 'She says she won't.' In a rollicking, rousing address that lasted 50 minutes and ended well after 11pm, Clinton gave a full-throated endorsement to the man whose campaign portrayed him as a racist in 2008 and left considerable bitterness on both sides. Clinton's endorsement of his wife's former rival and willingness to throw his full weight behind Obama represented a public rapprochement between the two Democratic camps. His speech also set off a frenzy of speculation over the 2016 race. While Clinton was on his feet, the hash tag '#Hillary 2016' became the top trend on Twitter in the U.S. Scroll down for video of Bill Clinton's convention speech . Former President Bill Clinton looks up at the delegates before addressing the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, last night . That's my man: Hillary Clinton watches her husband's speech on television while on a visit to Asia . The trend reached its peak ten minutes after Clinton mentioned her in his speech. He praised Obama for bringing his vanquished rival into the tent: 'He appointed Cabinet members who supported Hillary in the primaries. Heck, he even appointed Hillary!' Clinton said to loud cheers and a standing ovation. He added: 'I'm so proud of her and grateful to our entire national security team.' When her husband was speaking, Mrs Clinton was 9,930 miles in Dili, the capital of Timor-Leste in south-east Asia. She watched the speech via SlingPlayer on an aide's TiVo via the U.S. ambassador's home computer. A Clinton adviser told Politico's Playbook: 'From the moment the introductory video came on, she was riveted - as were the members of the travelling party who watched with her. It's safe to say that she loved every single minute of it. It's possible she did not blink even once. 'When the speech ended, she was as surprised and excited as everyone in the arena and watching at home when President Obama joined President Clinton on stage. She had no idea it was coming, she cheered and practically jumped out of her chair.' At a press conference in Dili before she watched the speech, Mrs Clinton said she had read parts of the speech and was anxious to compare the 'as prepared' remarks to those 'as delivered' - a wise precaution because he added in about 20 minutes more material. 'It is a great honour for him to be nominating the president,' she said. 'This is the first convention I've missed in many, many years.' As America's top diplomat, the former First Lady and U.S. Senator for New York cannot by tradition participate in politics. Chelsea Clinton, now a special correspondent for NBC News, led a panel on civic engagement for youth before listening to her father's speech in the convention hall. 'It was great,' Mrs Clinton told reporters aboard her plane as she prepared to leave Timor-Leste. She said she spoke with her husband during the drive to the airport. Best of enemies? Clinton and Obama hug at the end of the DNC speech... but relations have not been so close in the past . Family affair: Chelsea Clinton moderates a town-hall style meeting called 'Conversations With The Next Generation' in Charlotte before watching her father's speech at the convention . After his early reference to Obama's appointing her, Clinton didn't mention . his wife again, but the subtext was clear - the Clintons remain the most powerful force within the Democratic Party. Characteristically, Clinton took his time, using the 50-minute speech both to reaffirm his . support for Obama and to remind voters of the robust economy he presided . over during two terms in the White House with Mrs Clinton by his side. In . nominating Obama as the Democratic standard-bearer, Mr Clinton said . the president began the long road to recovery and has laid the . foundation for a stronger economy. As Obama listened with delegates to the Democratic convention, Mr . Clinton said Americans have a choice between the winner-take-all society . supported by Republicans and a Democratic vision of shared . responsibility and prosperity. Clinton, . rebutting the Republican contention that the economy has worsened under  Obama, said Republicans would return to the failed policies of the . past. He posed his own version of the Republicans' 'Are you better off?' question: 'What kind of country do you want to live in?' Clinton . said that is the most important question facing the nation as it . decides whether to return 'r Obama to the White House or replace him . with Republican Mitt Romney. 'If . you want a ""you're-on-your-own, winner-take-all"" society, you should . support the Republican ticket,' Mr Clinton said. 'If you want a country . of shared prosperity and shared responsibility - a . we're-all-in-this-together society - you should vote for Barack Obama . and Joe Biden.' Brothers in arms: Barack Obama and Mr Clinton smile at delegates after the ex-president's 50-minute speech . Heroes: Mr Obama and his Democratic predecessor bask in a prolonged standing ovation . Enlarge . Clinton said Obama inherited a damaged economy and 'put a floor under the crash'. He said he then laid the foundation for a more balanced economy that will produce millions of jobs, new businesses and riches to innovators. The former president appeared at the convention as Obama's top validator - an antidote to Republican claims that Mr Obama has made the economy worse and a reminder of a recent period in history when the economy boomed. The Obama campaign sent out a fundraising email under Mr Clinton's name yesterday. The message: 'It is absolutely urgent we win this election.' Earlier, Clinton told NBC News he was not trying to promote another presidential campaign for his wife, who will be 69 in 2016. The former president said: 'We're not kids any more. I don't have any idea if she'll ever run again. She says she won't.' Clinton's popularity has soared since her bruising campaign against Obama, and she would begin the 2016 nomination contest as a heavy favourite if she were to pursue it. After Clinton finished his speech, several of his former aides hugged and slapped high-fives in the back of the arena. Long-time adviser Harold Ickes beamed with pride. He said: 'He knows how to make the case. I've seen him make the case even when he doesn't have much to work with. He has a lot to work with. He made a very powerful case for re-election.'","Former President set off speculation that his wife might run for White House in 2016 in interview before his DNC speech .

At the same time Hawkes was running a website with his wife Pauline, 53, which sold bootlegged copies of blockbuster movies, music albums and console games, from his £300,000 country home in the village of Scarisbrick, near Southport, Merseyside. While Lester Hawkes claimed £74,000 over two years for severe chest problems, he and his wife Pauline were making £65,000 a year from the illegal sale of games, DVDs and music .

During a raid officers found Hawkes had . been hiding his illegal products in a secret room under a trap door in . the hallway, covered by a rug. The website made the couple an extra £65,000 a year for seven years and allowed them to lead an affluent lifestyle in a four-bedroom detached house with large plasma screen televisions and fish tanks costing around £2,000 each - while leaving the tax payer to pick up the £640 monthly rent.

But passing sentence Judge Robert Warnock told Hawkes: 'You were one of the controlling minds and operators behind a very substantial fraudulent enterprise. 'While I have no doubt others were involved, I am also clear that you were at or near the top of the managerial structure involved.

'I am pleased to see that justice has been served. The trade in counterfeit products damages legitimate businesses as well as funding criminality and is often linked to serious and organised crime.' BPI Director of Anti-Piracy David Wood said: 'The prison sentence handed down in this case demonstrates that those who produce and sell counterfeit goods are not beyond the law. 'Their actions defraud musicians and undermine legitimate high street retailers and independent record stores in these difficult economic times.

Shadow minister Willie Bain revealed that senior members of Labour leader Ed Miliband's team have asked him to examine the issue of making benefits a 'human right' Labour is drawing up plans to make claiming benefits a ‘human right’ despite fresh evidence of overwhelming public support for the Government’s welfare crackdown. Shadow minister Willie Bain revealed that senior members of Labour leader Ed Miliband’s team have asked him to examine the issue, despite fears it would be dubbed a ‘scroungers’ charter’. At a dinner hosted by the socialist Fabian Society, Mr Bain, the shadow minister for Scotland, said he was looking at whether ‘economic and social rights can be put into law’. Mr Bain, a member of the Unite trade union, said: ‘It needs really careful handling because I think the politics of this would be the Tories would say it’s a scrounger’s charter, helping skivers. ‘It would need to be bombproof if we were to do it. ‘We might just talk about having a commission on it.’ Mr Bain suggested the move, which would extend ‘human rights’ into the economic field for the first time, might help Mr Miliband strike a coalition deal with Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg after the next election. He said he had been asked to carry out the review by Mr Miliband’s policy chief, Jon  Cruddas, and the shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan. The revelation comes as the Government’s flagship benefits cap is rolled out across the  country for the first time today. The scheme, which has been piloted in four London boroughs, caps the maximum benefits a family can claim at £26,000 a year – a figure equal to a pre-tax salary of more than £34,000. A poll today reveals that almost three-quarters of the public back the cap, with two-thirds saying it will help get people on benefits back into work. The Ipsos Mori poll commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions found that just 11 per cent of the public think the benefits system is working effectively. Some 59 per cent said they wanted politicians to do more to cut Britain’s welfare bill. A total of 74 per cent said they supported the benefits cap. At a dinner hosted by the socialist Fabian Society, Mr Bain, the shadow minister for Scotland, said he was looking at whether 'economic and social rights can be put into law¿' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Bain's comments showed that Labour is serious about reforming the welfare system . A third of those who said they opposed the cap said they were against it because, at £500 a week, it had been set too high. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Bain’s comments showed that Labour is serious about reforming the welfare system. He said: ‘As if we needed any more proof Labour are still the same old welfare party, Ed Miliband has now decided that claiming benefits is a human right. ‘Today this Government is capping benefits so that nobody who’s out of work can claim more than the average hardworking family earns. Today’s findings show the British public are fully behind us in this. ‘Labour, meanwhile, are making secret plans so that people can claim unlimited benefits with absolutely no incentive to work.’ A Labour spokesman insisted it was not considering a change to give people a human right to claim benefits. He said: ‘The discussion at a Fabian Society event was about methods used abroad, not something the Labour Party is considering as a policy.’","Shadow minister Willie Bain said he's looking at whether ‘economic and social rights can be put into law’

A public inquiry into the poisoning of ex-KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko was rejected because the government did not want to fall out with Russia, it emerged today. Home Secretary Theresa May said protecting 'international relations' had played a part in the decision to reject the request  to hold a full probe. Coroner Sir Robert Owen had warned a public inquiry was needed because he could not consider vital secret evidence as part of a normal inquest. Ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko died in 2006 in London's University College Hospital after being poisoned . This was backed by Mr Litvinenko’s widow Marina, who said she and her legal team were ‘shocked and disappointed’ by the Government’s refusal. But in a letter to Sir Robert the Home Secretary revealed part of the reason for turning down the request was the desire not to upset Russian President Vladamir Putin. Mrs May wrote: ‘It is true that international relations have been a factor in the Government’s decision-making. ‘An inquest managed and run by an independent coroner is more readily explainable to some of our foreign partners, and the integrity of the process more readily grasped, than an inquiry, established by the Government, under a chairman appointed by the Government, which has the power to see Government material potentially relevant to their interests, in secret. ‘However this has not been a decisive factor and it if had stood alone would not have led the Government to refuse an inquiry.’ Home Secretary Theresa May suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin would not think a public inquiry was independent . Mrs May said that the Government is anxious that Mr Litvinenko’s death is properly investigated, and accepts that there are ‘important factors’ in favour of establishing an inquiry. She wrote: ‘May I begin by assuring you that the Government shares your concern to make certain that the tragic death of Mr Litvinenko is properly investigated. ‘Like you, the Government is anxious that as much as possible of the investigation is conducted in public, and in such a way that Mr Litvinenko’s family are as closely involved in the process as is consistent with the public interest.’ Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Llitvinenko, has vowed to continue her fight for the truth . Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with . radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in . London’s Grosvenor Square in 2006. Since his death his widow and son Anatoly have battled to discover the truth about what led to his killing. Mrs May told Sir Robert the inquest will be able to address key concerns. ‘It is the view of the Government that, despite the serious concerns you express, an inquest will go a substantial way to addressing or allaying public concern about this incident,’ she said. ‘It will be able to use open material, for example, to explore the circumstances in which the polonium was brought into this country, to ascertain the likely movement of the polonium and those who were apparently carrying it around the country; to expose the evidence about the events leading up to the murder.’ She said that an inquiry would take longer and cost more than a normal inquest, and that ministers could address any remaining concerns over Mr Litvinenko’s death after legal proceedings had finished, possibly with an independent review. ‘The question whether or not public concern remains at the end of that process is a matter primarily for ministers and one best judged at the conclusion of the inquest.’ Any secret evidence presented during a public inquiry would have to be held in closed session and would remain private, she said. ‘The result would be that an inquiry would reveal publicly only that which the inquest would reveal publicly. The persons perhaps most closely concerned with the investigation, namely Marina and Anatoly Litvinenko, would learn no more from an inquiry than they would from the inquest.’","Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London hotel in 2006 .

Ballet is like pornography because it is often choreographed by men, the English National Ballet’s new artistic director has said. Tamara Rojo wants more female choreographers for her company, after saying that because of the many male directors in dance, ‘Like in porn, it shapes the way you look at things’. The 39-year-old dancer and director said that relationships are often shown from a male perspective and that she wants to see certain issues ‘approached by women on stage’. Miss Rojo said that men often approach dance choreography in a ‘more physical’ way by starting with the steps, rather than women who often begin with the ‘emotional landscape’. She told Time Out magazine: ‘Female sensitivity is different. And there are issues that I want to see on stage approached by women. 'Very often we see relationships approached from a male perspective. ‘Like in porn, it shapes the way you look at things. It tends to be a more physical approach. Men start with the steps. I find women start with the emotional landscape. ‘They say, “This is the situation, let’s find a language for it”. With men, it tends to be, “this is the language”, and then you try to work out the situation through the steps.’ She added that the lack of female choreographers is partially down to women taking breaks to have children and that they are ‘not aggressive in self-promotion’.

But works by young female choreographers have been featured by both companies on tours and for performances not on the main stages. For example, a fusion of ballet and contemporary dance was co-choreographed for a tour this year by Jenna Lee of the English National Ballet, with Flawless from Britain’s Got Talent.","Tamara Rojo, 39, wants more female choreographers for her company .

Soaring: The AA warned the wholesale cost of petrol across Europe has been driven up, which has led to price rises at the pumps . Petrol prices are set to rise by 5p a litre just as the summer getaway begins, the AA has warned. It blames the increase at the pumps on profiteering speculators ‘betting on rising oil prices’. They buy huge quantities of petroleum on the open market and store it until the price rises and they can sell for a handsome profit. This has already driven up the wholesale cost of petrol across Europe and led to price rises at the pumps – with more to come, the AA says. The warning comes days after competition watchdogs came under fire for rejecting demands for an inquiry into the lack of transparency in the fuel markets. The AA said: ‘It was perhaps inevitable that oil and fuel market speculators would cast a black cloud over what was promising to be a glorious summer.’ Also, the pound has fallen against the US dollar, the currency in which oil is traded, making it more expensive for UK buyers. On average, UK petrol prices have risen by more than 1p from 134.61p a litre in mid-June to 135.78p now. Diesel has risen from 139.16p a month ago to 140.24p. The AA said: ‘A $100-a-tonne increase in the cost of petrol across north-west Europe,  combined with a weaker pound, heralds a potential 5p increase  in pump petrol costs.’ Profiteering Speculators: The rise is said to be down to the practice of buying large quantities of petroleum on the open market and waiting for the price rises to make a profit .","Increase is said to be down to profiteering speculators 'betting on riding prices'

Dr Judith Ames appears before the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service accused of affair with husband of terminal cancer victim she was treating . A doctor started an affair with the husband of one of her patients just days after his wife died from cancer, a tribunal heard yesterday. Dr Judith Ames, 55, was so besotted with the newly widowed man that she vowed to marry him just two weeks later. Two days before Patient A’s death, on March 8, Dr Ames revealed to a receptionist that she had developed a bond with Mr X and was off to the couple’s home for ‘gin and tonics’. She also confided in a community nurse that she was emotionally involved with Patient A and her family. Within a month the GP had moved into his marital home and told colleagues she would quit her job if they disapproved of their relationship. But friends and family of the dead woman were unhappy about the situation and Dr Ames was reported to the General Medical Council. Speaking at a hearing of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, Simon Phillips, QC, for the GMC, said: ‘Patient A trusted Dr Ames to care for her and invited her into the family home. ‘Patient A was in a vulnerable position. Patient A’s family would have been in a vulnerable position. Dr Ames breached patient A’s trust. She knew or ought to have been aware that Mr X was likely to be vulnerable due to the recent death of his wife.’ The panel, which will decide whether the family doctor is fit to carry on working or should be struck off the medical register, was told that Dr Ames met Mr X while treating his wife for lung cancer. The GP was working at the Mannamead Surgery, in Plymouth, when the woman went for a consultation in May 2011 complaining of dizziness. She was referred to hospital, where medics diagnosed lung cancer. Mr Phillips said that between May 2011 and March 2012, when Patient A died at the age of 59, Dr Ames made regular trips to the home she shared with her husband. Dr Ames denies her actions were sexually motivated and an abuse of her professional position . Dr Ames visited her on the day of her death and returned to her home the following day. Although the woman’s husband was also registered at the practice, Dr Ames never treated him, the barrister added. Patient A died on March 8 and, on the day of the funeral, eight days later, Mr X texted Dr Ames, who was away on holiday. She agreed to meet him for a bereavement visit the following weekend. They met up and decided they wanted to be together. ‘On her return from holiday . Ames … discussed personal interests with Mr X following Mr X saying he . no longer needed professional assistance from her in respect of his . bereavement,’ Mr Phillips added. ‘On the weekend of March 24 and 25, . 2012, she agreed to attend church with Mr X and both he and Dr Ames . decided that they wanted to have a relationship.’ On the Monday morning . Dr Ames contacted her surgery and asked to be transferred to another . practice. She told her business partner, Dr Peter Lemen that she wanted . to have a relationship with Mr X and she planned to marry him. Days before the patient¿s death Dr Ames, a partner at the Mannamead Surgery in Plymouth, Devon, told her receptionist she was off to the couple¿s home for a 'G&T' Mr Phillips added: ‘She told him that . she would be willing to resign from the practice if they were not happy . with the relationship. Dr Lemen said he was taken aback and arranged a . meeting with the other partners to discuss the matter.’ The panel were told that Dr Ames even . called the GMC to inform regulators of the relationship before . colleagues wrote with concerns. The same week Mr X spoke to one of his . late wife’s close friends by telephone and told her he was planning to . marry again and that he had been in a relationship for the past . fortnight. It is alleged that Dr Ames' actions were . sexually motivated, an abuse of her professional position and were not . in accordance with the GMC's guidance 'Maintaining Boundaries' He told the friend that his new lover, . Dr Ames, was ‘upstairs in bed’. The QC added: ‘She (the friend) said . that she was shocked.’ On April 1 Dr Ames spoke to another . partner at the medical practice, Dr Christopher Lloyd, and told him she . had formed an emotional relationship with the spouse of one of her . patients during the course of caring for his wife. The following day the partners held a . meeting, at which Dr Ames said she accepted the relationship with Mr X . was likely to be in breach of GMC rules. She claimed their relationship had the . ‘genuine approval’ of Patient A’s family and that neighbours of Mr X . were ‘supportive’. However, the panel heard that they were not happy . about the affair.Last night it was unclear whether Dr Ames and Mr X, who . moved in together on April 14, were still in a relationship. The GP was . wearing a wedding ring at the hearing. Dr Ames, who is subject to seven . conditions on her registration for the duration of proceedings, faces . allegations that her actions were sexually motivated, an abuse of her . professional position and contrary to the GMC’s guidelines.

P&O has become the latest firm to have a global tax avoidance scheme thrown out as the Treasury claimed £1billion has been clawed back already this year. The shipping and logistics firm, the parent company of P&O ferries and among other maritime business, was accused of an ‘elaborate trick’ in using a complex scheme to get an extra £14 million in tax relief. It came as ministers said a tax avoidance clampdown had protected £1billion in court battles with international firms trying to avoid paying their way in Britain. All at sea: The tax avoidance scheme by P&O group, which owned P&O ferries, dated back to 2004 and was described by a tribunal as 'elaborate trick' HMRC successfully challenged the P&O scheme at a First Tier Tribunal, which ruled that the transactions were all part of an ‘elaborate trick’ designed to exploit the rules. The Tribunal said: ‘It is clear that the scheme would only work so long as every participant in it was either a captive company or a stooge employee of a company within the P&O group.’ In its verdict it added that the scheme was ‘designed and implemented for no reason other than tax avoidance’. The scheme dates back to 2004 but Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which owned P&O ferries, was bought by Dubai Ports World in 2005 in a takeover deal worth £3.3billion. The legal battle had dragged on for nine years, although the laws being exploited by P&O were repealed in 2005 to stop other companies following suit. Treasury minister David Gauke said HMRC would continue to go after 'complex and intricate' schemes . Today David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘I’m delighted that HMRC has successfully defeated this attempt by a major company to artificially reduce its tax bill by exploiting an extremely complex international financial structure. ‘The Government has made it very clear that we won’t put up with aggressive tax avoidance and we have resourced HMRC to take on even the most complex and convoluted schemes, as this Tribunal decision shows.’ A total of £154 million of tax was protected, the Treasury said. However, DP World said it was filing an application for permission to appeal against the decision. A spokesman: 'This decision relates to a dispute between P&O and HMRC about the double tax treatment of profits repatriated to the UK in 2004, before we acquired P&O in 2006. 'This technical debate involves complex 2001 legislation that has now been repealed. 'Since the transactions took place there have also been changes to the corporation tax rules on dividends and distributions, with  Parliament and HMRC recognising that the law was impractical and unfair, and any company can now repatriate profits from its subsidiaries abroad without giving rise to the problems in this case. In light of these facts, we have filed an application for permission to appeal the decision.' But Mr Gauke boasted that it was just the latest victory for HMRC after also taking on corporate giants including Land Securities and the Bristol and West bank in the courts. All of the firms claimed to be using legitimate schemes to whittle down their tax bills. But after being challenged, the court tax tribunal slapped down their arrangements, and the companies were forced to cough up the unpaid bills. Mr Gauke said: ‘HMRC has already topped £1bn in court wins against corporate tax avoidance this year. ‘Schemes like this are complex and intricate, and without the technical skills, resources and commitment of HMRC’s specialists they would go unchallenged, costing the country billions of pounds every year.’ The biggest sum, around £600m, came from breakdown insurance group WHA, which was accused of trying to recover VAT through a scheme that used two companies based in Gibraltar.","Firm used 'elaborate trick' to get an extra £14million in tax relief .

This is a scene from the original Man on the Moon starring Jim Carrey, left . Cut: But in this Netflix version, Jim Carrey's character is completely missing from this scene . Worrying: Classics such as Planet of the Apes are also affected. This is a scene from the original version of the 1968 film . Cropped: But as this image shows, in the Netflix version the entire table of three people is completely missing . However, the firm this afternoon said it was not cropping films but occasionally offered the wrong version of a title. Netflix said when it discovers errors, it works to replace the title as soon as possible. As reported by Gizmodo, a Tumblr page, called What Netflix Does, highlights the extent of the problem. In a scene from the 1968 classic Planet of the Apes, half of the original version is cut from the Netflix film, resulting in viewers not seeing a table of three characters. In the 1999 film Man on the Moon, the lead character Jim Carrey is cropped out entirely from a scene in the Netflix film. A scene from the original version of Quentin Tarantino's hit Inglourious Basterds features a table of five people. But in the Netflix version, it is heavily cropped, with just two characters featuring prominently. Popular: Quentin Tarantino's hit Inglourious Basterds also does not appear to escape the attention of the croppers . Different: Despite the original scene showing a table of five people, the Netflix version centres in on just two characters . Classic: This is the original version of the 1984 film Dune . Missing: But as this image shows, the version which Netflix subscribers see misses out two characters . Film critics claimed the cropping occurs because Netflix prefers to show wider-screen films. But in order to make these films fit the viewer's screens, they accused the firm of cropping out sections of the original. But film fans and critics have been left angered because they are not told about it. Many older films which have been modified in the past feature this disclaimer before the start of a movie. 'This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.' Flavorwire's film critic Jason Bailey had been left furious by the apparent cropping: 'The framing choices made by a director and cinematographer are important. Ratios: The cropping appears to take place when Netflix attempts to make widescreen films fit the screens. This shows the original version of Last Action Hero . Altered: As this image shows, the Netflix version again cuts out a large section of the original . Original: This is a scene from the 2004 film The Passion of the Christ . Radical: But in the Netflix version, it entirely missed out one of the men hanging on a crucifix . 'You don’t go around chopping off the . tops of paintings so they fit in the frames you’ve got lying around, . and you don’t go around slicing off the edges of movies so you don’t . have to deal with letterboxing. 'And if Netflix is going to insist on . doing so, they should at least have the courtesy to tell us they’re . monkeying with their merchandise.' A Netflix spokesman said: 'We want to offer the best picture and provide the original aspect ratio of any title on Netflix. 'However, unfortunately our quality controls sometimes fail and we end up offering the wrong version of a title. 'When we discover this error, we work to replace that title as soon as possible.'

The remorselessly rising number of carrier bags used by shoppers in England passed seven billion last year, official figures show. Despite repeated promises by David Cameron to curb the plastic carriers handed out by supermarkets, the total has shot up by more than 12 per cent in two years. By contrast the number of bags used in Wales – where shoppers have been asked to pay a 5p levy on each bag they take from a shop – has fallen from 270million to 70million since the charge came in. Scourge: Tesco plastic bags cast aside near a Tesco Extra store in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The number of plastic bags handed out has risen 12 per cent in two years despite Government promises to tackle their widespread use . The first full year’s bag count following the introduction of the charge in Wales appeared to vindicate retailers and campaigners who say the only way to cut numbers of bags is to impose a levy. Mr Cameron and George Osborne have declined to follow the Welsh example through fears that voters would resent paying extra for plastic carriers that have always been provided free by supermarkets. However, research in Wales suggests a big majority of shoppers supports the levy, from which money raised goes to charity rather than the Government. The British Retail Consortium, which . represents the retail industry, said progress had been made in England, . and that the weight of plastic handed out at the tills had fallen . because bags are becoming smaller and lighter. A Pacific Green Turtle suffocates on a plastic bag: Marine animals and birds suffer long, painful deaths after eating them or getting tangled in them . But it said: ‘If you want to go further and faster on this you would have to introduce legislation for a charge.’ The Daily Mail’s Banish The Bags campaign has been calling for action to cut the numbers of bags and the environmental damage they cause when they are discarded. Many of the bags are used for only 20 minutes but take up to 1,000 years to rot away. They litter the landscape and devastate marine animals and birds, which suffer long, painful deaths after eating them or getting tangled in them. The bag count, produced by the Government’s Waste and Resources Action Programme, showed that in 2012 the number used in England went up by 290million to 7.06billion, a 4.4 per cent rise. Over two years the increase has been almost 800million. The increase pushed numbers used in the UK as a whole over the eight billion mark, despite the collapse in numbers in Wales and steady usage in Scotland, which will introduce a charge next year, and Northern Ireland, where one was implemented in April . In Wales, where the 5p levy was introduced in November 2011, 350million bags were used in 2010, a total which fell to 270million in 2011 as the levy came into play. Last year 70million carrier bags were used in Wales. Alun Davies, Welsh minister for natural resources and food, said: ‘Checkouts in Wales are now full of people reusing their bags. The figures show that a compulsory charge really does work.’ Samantha Harding, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘An increase in bag use in England and a massive decrease in Wales are resounding evidence for the Government to finally introduce a charge on carrier bags in England.’ In England among major supermarkets only Marks & Spencer has imposed its own 5p charge.","The total number of bags given out has shot up 12 per cent in two years .

A man who beat a church organist to death as he made his way to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve has been told he will serve at least 25 years in prison. Jonathan Bowling, 22, who admitted murdering Alan Greaves, 68, in the High Green area of Sheffield as the pensioner was on his way to play at the service last Christmas, was handed a life sentence today. His step-brother Ashley Foster, also 22, was sentenced to nine years at Sheffield Crown Court today for the manslaughter of Mr Greaves. Scroll down for video . Sentenced: Jonathan Bowling, 22, left, was told he will serve at least 25 years for the murder of Alan Greaves, while Ashley Foster, also 22, was sentenced to nine years for manslaughter . Murdered: Church organist Alan Greaves, pictured with his wife Maureen, died after he was brutally attacked as he made his way to midnight mass on Christmas Eve . Mr Greaves’s widow, Maureen, said she was 'happy' with the sentences. Outside court she said: 'I really am extremely pleased with the result today. 'To think Ashley’s got nine years is the very best we could have got in the circumstances of the manslaughter. 'To think that Jonathan’s got 25 minimum and to think he’ll probably never come out, I really am wonderfully pleased with the result.' She told reporters she would not read a letter Bowling had written to her. 'To put it into my hands the days he was going to get sentenced, I didn’t think it was very appropriate,' she said. 'If he was going to write me a letter he should have written it a long time ago.' 'Soul mate': Bowling and Foster left Mr Greaves with injuries similar to those suffered by car crash victims when they set upon him with a pick-axe handle in Sheffield . The court heard that Foster and Bowling had left a family gathering earlier on the evening of Christmas Eve last year. According to prosecutors, they were angrily stalking the streets of High Green looking for someone to attack. If they had not killed Mr Greaves, a retired social worker, it would have been someone else, the jury was told. Senior police officers said the pair were simply out 'looking for trouble'. Prosecutor Robert Smith QC told the court today: 'It was a crime without motive. 'He was killed for no reason other than that he had been identified as a suitable victim.' Earlier today, the court heard how Bowling of Carwood Way, Pitsmoor, Sheffield, has a number of convictions for violence dating back to his teens. In 2005 he head-butted a 48-year-woman after she complained about him throwing snowballs at her windows. A year later, when he was 15-years-old, he was given a two year detention order after he attacked a jogger in Chapeltown, Sheffield, leaving his victim with serious head injuries, including a suspected broken cheekbone. Bowling was then convicted for brandishing a hammer when a police officer stopped him then threatening a woman with a hammer in a separate incident. In 2008 he and a girl pinned a 14-year-old boy to the floor before he kicked and punched the teenager in the ribs. The court heard he had served a number of detention orders in relation to these offences. Foster, of Wesley Road, High Green, had no previous convictions for violence. Foster and Bowling, who were both unemployed, had known each other since their early teens when Bowling's father was in a relationship with Foster's mother. They have been described as step-brothers. Mr Greaves was a social worker for 35 years before he retired about eight years ago. He and Mrs Greaves had been married for 40 years and have four children and two grandchildren. He was devoted to music and the church - playing the organ at different services around Sheffield - and also singing in choirs. Mr Greaves took part in a range of other community activities, including playing piano in the local primary school, serving as a school governor, helping in a charity shop and even launching a food bank for people in High Green. The sentencing came after Mr Greaves' heartbroken widow Maureen Greaves refused to condemn her husband's killers. Committed Christian Mrs Greaves, 63, . said she had no feelings of 'hate' towards the men behind the senseless . attack on her husband - who she described as her 'soul mate' - and . instead insisted she would pray for Bowling and Foster. She told of her hope that 'God's great mercy will inspire them to true repentance'. Mrs Greaves had spoken out after a jury found Foster guilty of Mr Greaves' manslaughter. Bowling had previously admitted murder.","Jonathan Bowling admitting murdering Alan Greaves as he walked to mass .

Then he saw his bloody face on the New York Daily News front-page after allegedly taking the hat off a deputy inspector’s head, being chased into the camp and hitting his head on the concrete. But he pleaded not guilty to charges relating to the alleged cap theft on Friday, with his lawyer claiming he was assaulted by police and has four staples in his scalp because of his injuries. Watts has been arrested five times since the protest began two months ago and has been living on his own since his early teens, his lawyer said, adding that he suffers from emotional problems.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:24 EST, 18 November 2011 . This is the dramatic moment a protester felt the full force of the police - when she was pepper sprayed in the face. The woman was drenched during yesterday's rally in Portland, Oregon - just one of several demonstrations across the U.S. marking the Occupy movement's two month birthday. Thousands also took to the streets in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Boston and Washington. It came as protesters were starting to lose the support of residents fed-up with their violence and the continual disruption of their daily lives. Peppered: A police officer sprays a protester in the face during the Occupy Portland event yesterday in Pioneer Courthouse Square . Violence: Protester Brendan Watts is drenched in blood after a confrontation with police officers in New York yesterday . What is pepper spray? It is a lachrymatory agent - a chemical compound that irritates the eyes and causes tears, pain and temporary blindness. Also known as OC spray (Oleoresin Capsicum), OC gas and capsicum spray. Seattle activist Dorli Rainey, 84, was sprayed in the face on Tuesday. What is it made out of? An extract from the cayenne pepper plant, which is mixed with natural oil. It is then placed into a container and pressurised to create a spray or an aerosol. The cayenne pepper plant is better known as a very hot spice used for cooking and is also used in prescription drugs. What are the effects of pepper spray? Eyes tear up, forcing them to close as the capillaries dilate, and remain bloodshot for 45 minutes. Throat swells for half hour, restricting the airway - forcing victim to give up the fight - uncontrollable coughing, retching, and gasping for air with a gagging sensation in the throat. Skin becomes inflamed, with some people losing balance because of loss of vision. When was it developed? OC spray created in 1960 at University of Georgia. First sold as Halt Animal Repellent in 1963, before FBI authorised its use in 1989. The use of tear gas in Oakland, California, pepper spray in Portland, Chicago and New York, and the hundreds of arrests, has shone the spotlight on the varying crowd control tactics of police. It has also highlighted the aggression being used by some protesters. Experts on policing have said departments are using necessary tactics to control unpredictable, sometimes violent protesters, and that the police has yet not reached the stages yet of full riot protection. 'I don't think they're rioting at Occupy Wall Street, not yet, but they are getting out of control,' said Maki Haberfeld, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. She added: 'If they were rioting, you would see much more riot gear like sonic devices and high-powered weapons'. But the images that have played across the country have been disconcerting to some. 'When somebody puts their hands on somebody itself, it never looks right,' Haberfeld said. 'But this is what they're allowed to do. It is truly not excessive and I am surprised by how not excessive it is.' The demonstrations yesterday were for the most part peaceful. But at least 300 people were arrested in New York and dozens were arrested elsewhere. These included five on charges they assaulted police officers by throwing liquid into several officers' faces and tossing glass at another. 'We will assure that everyone has the . right to exercise their First Amendment rights,' New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg . said after visiting one hospitalised officer who needed 20 stitches on . his hand. Containment: Police officers in Seattle used litres of pepper spray to bring the Occupy members under control on Tuesday . Injured: An Occupy Seattle activist (left) is treated by comrades, as similar scenes (right) unfurled in Zuccotti Park in New York on Tuesday . He added: 'But if anyone's actions cross the line and threaten the health and safety of others including our first responders, we will respond accordingly.' Chanting 'All day, all week, shut down Wall Street', more than 1,000 protesters gathered near the New York Stock Exchange yesterday and sat down in several intersections. Several thousand later jammed Manhattan's Foley Square and marched to the Brooklyn Bridge. Several weeks ago, an attempt to march across the bridge drew the first significant international attention to the Occupy movement as more than 700 people were arrested. Invasion: Occupy protesters marched above lanes of speeding cars as they took over Brooklyn Bridge last night . Rally: The march continued across the historical bridge's pedestrian promenade . Illuminated: A 99% light projection was cast on a building as Occupy Wall Street protesters marched last night . In Seattle, hundreds of protesters marched down the University Bridge. Traffic was snarled as demonstrators from two different rallies held marches. In Los Angeles, helmeted police equipped with batons surrounded the base of a bank tower, but the protest remained peaceful. Several hundred Occupy sympathisers marched to the Bank of America Plaza in down town Los Angeles, with some setting up tents on a lawn. Police arrested two dozen people after they sat down in a street during a peaceful rally by hundreds of people organized by labour groups who had a permit. Authorities cleared an encampment set up by Occupy protesters on the University of California, Berkeley campus; with 150 police officers and deputies in riot gear. Different opinions: But Derrick Tabacco, left, a small business owner, joined a small group counter-demonstrating against the Occupy Wall Street march near the New York Stock Exchange yesterday . Occupy Los Angeles: A contingent of LAPD officers gathered in the street at the Bank of America Plaza yesterday . Occupy Los Angeles: A protester was hauled to the ground by LAPD officers during the Day of Action in the city yesterday . Police arrested 21 demonstrators in Las Vegas, and 20 were led away in plastic handcuffs in Portland, Oregon, for sitting down on a bridge. At least a dozen were arrested in St Louis after they sat down cross-legged and locked arms in an attempt to block a bridge over the Mississippi River. Several of the demonstrations coincided with an event planned months earlier by a coalition of unions and liberal groups, including Moveon.org and the Service Employees International Union, in which out-of-work people walked over bridges in several cities to protest high unemployment. The street demonstrations also marked two months since the Occupy movement sprang to life in New York on September 17. They were planned well before police raided a number of encampments over the past few days, but were seen by some activists as a way to demonstrate their resolve in the wake of the crackdown.

Paul Foster, who has been served with an eviction notice for playing Chris de Burgh's tune too loudly . This is the first picture of the neighbour-from-hell who has been forced out of his home - for repeatedly blasting out Chris de Burgh’s hit Lady In Red tune so loudly that neighbouring walls vibrated. Paul Foster, 51, also belted out tracks by Pink Floyd and played love songs on late-night radio shows at full volume. Fed-up neighbours in Chesterton, Staffordshire, said Foster would often leave his music on all night from his collection of albums by the British band. But his favourite tune by far was the 1986 UK number one smash hit Lady In Red by Chris de Burgh - which he played daily. Foster was jailed for 28 days last month following the latest in a long line of injunction breaches. And he has now been ordered to leave his home by August 7 after landlord Aspire Housing secured an eviction notice in court. Neighbour Susan Baxter, 39, started to complain about Foster when his music was so loud it made her walls vibrate. And the housewife said enough was enough when a teacher phoned to say one of her children had fallen asleep at school because the noise was keeping them up at night. Susan, who lives with her children Emma, 16, Thomas, nine, and six-year-old Alex, said: 'At first I asked him politely to turn the music down. He would say ""yes"" and then an hour later it would be back up again. Fed-up neighbours in Chesterton, Staffordshire, said Foster would often leave his music on all night . Neighbour Susan Baxter started to complain about Foster when his music was so loud it made her walls vibrate . 'It was disturbing me, but not the . children, so I didn’t do anything. But as soon as it started waking up . the children, I called Aspire. 'Every now and then the music would be played throughout the night. 'It was so loud it made my walls vibrate. You could hear the songs word for word. 'I had one call from teachers saying my son had fallen asleep in class - that was after a night when the music had been keeping us awake. 'Sometimes he would go out in a taxi and still leave the music playing full blast while he was out. 'This year my daughter has been trying to revise for her GCSEs and it hasn’t helped. 'Eventually we got an injunction against him, but he has carried on breaching it.' Foster was jailed for 28 days at Stoke-on-Trent County Court on June 11 for breaching an injunction from playing loud music for the fifth time. The court heard how one family even moved out of the area because they couldn’t put up with the constant din. Speaking about evicting Foster, Aspire head of housing Caroline Baggaley said: . 'Mr Foster’s anti-social behaviour caused misery for his neighbours and the wider community. 'We have tried every possible way to get him to behave in an acceptable way but he didn’t change. 'We hope this will bring an end to the problems he has caused. We do not tolerate anti-social behaviour.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:05 EST, 18 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:23 EST, 18 July 2013 . Face of the future: Labour's Lord Mitchell claimed that instead of travelling across the country for meetings, people could talk to lifelike holograms, like this one of singer Paloma Faith launched last year . A high speed rail line linking London . to the north will be rendered unnecessary within 20 years because meetings will be held between holograms, Ed Miliband's new business guru claimed today. Lord Mitchell said he 'simply doesn't get the logic' of spending £40billion on the project when by 2033 it will be possible to talk to a 'perfect hologram of a person half way around the world sitting on a chair in front of us'. He became the latest senior Labour figure to speak out against HS2, after a former rail minister admitted the original price tag was ‘written on the back of a fag packet’. The latest intervention further erodes the cross-party consensus on the plan, which will take decades to build. The project ran into trouble when the government admitted recently that the bill had soared by £10billion to £42.6billion. Lord Mitchell was only named by Mr Miliband as a business ambassador and adviser on enterprise last night. But speaking in the House of Lords today he demolished the case for Labour's flagship pledge to build the HS2. The Labour party manifesto in 2010 . insisted a new high speed rail line linking north and south was 'at the . heart of our growth plan'. It promised journey times will be 'slashed' and more capacity would be freed up for freight and commuter services. But . Lord Mitchell said: 'I simply don't get the logic of spending £40 . billion plus just to enable people to get from Birmingham to London 23 . minutes earlier and Manchester to London 50 minutes earlier - for them . then to be stuck in monster traffic jams on the Euston Road.' By the time the line is built holograms will be so good, people will struggle to spot a real person, he claimed. Hi-tech: The quality of holograms has improved in recent years, since this one by artist Chris Levine in 2005 . Embarrassment: Lord Mitchell's comments are at odds with Labour leader Ed Miliband's support for the HS2 project . The . former chairman of United Leasing Ltd, who lists 'fiddling with . computers' in his interests in Who's Who, urged ministers to imagine . what the world would be like in 20 years' time when HS2 is scheduled to . be completed. Lord Mitchell said: 'In 2033 can we . imagine a technology which could transmit a perfect hologram of a person . half way around the world sitting on a chair in front of us? 'A hologram where you are hard pushed . to tell the real from the image. If this and thousands of other . technologies that are bubbling away come to pass, who in their right . mind would journey to a business meeting starting early in the day and . getting home late at night? 'It's why we should always project technology forward and factor this into all mega infrastructure decisions.' Realistic: Lord Mitchell said that in 20 years people will not be able to tell the difference between a real person and a hologram . But the hi-tech vision of the future . was dismissed by government spokesman Lord Newby, who insisted there . could be no substitute for meeting face to face. Lord Newby added: 'While I am sure a . hologram of myself in front of Birmingham City Council or a head teacher . would have been mightily impressive, I simply don't believe that at any . point in the foreseeable future we are going to do without transport.' However Lord Mitchell is just the latest senior Labour figure to signal a collapse in support for the project. Former Business Secretary Lord . Mandelson exploded the cross-party agreement earlier this month when he . admitted it risked becoming an 'expensive mistake'. Last night Tom Harris, a rail minister in Gordon Brown's government, said support for it was now on the rocks. ‘The original cost for HS2 was written on the back of a fag packet,’ he told BBC2’s Newsnight. ‘My . own party is strongly in favour of it. I was until relatively recently. I would suspect that the whole of the House of Commons would vote at . the moment to keep going ahead. ‘But I think the more that people talk about this… it is almost like a scepticism that dare not speak its name up until now.’ He said Lord Mandelson’s intervention . in a newspaper article earlier this month was ‘very, very good’ and had . ‘opened up a whole debate’. Mr Harries added: ‘I think more and more people are listening to those who are saying this might not be a great idea. ‘Austerity is going to be with us for a very long time. ‘Do . we really want to tell our constituents or taxpayers that we are . spending £50billion of their money on a train line that really doesn’t . need to be built and that money could spent in any number of areas far . more effectively.’ Warning: Former Labour rail minister Tom Harris said the business case for HS2 had been 'written on the back of a fag packet'  while Lord Mandelson now warned it could damage the north of England . Row: Further Labour admissions of doubts about HS2 are certain to be seized on by opponents of the project that it should not go ahead . Halt: Labour's Lord Mandelson now says his party was wrong to offer fulsome backing to the high speed rail project linking London and the north . Lord Mandelson said Labour's plans were based on an estimated cost of £30 billion and on a central assumption -  that its construction would spread growth across the country - which was ‘neither quantified nor proved’. But at the time Lib Dem transport minister Norman Baker hit back: ‘'It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs; be a major boost to our economy, especially in the North of England; and will help us shift to the clean, green economy of the future. 'More and more people are using the rail network every year so we desperately need more North-South capacity - unlike Peter Mandelson we can't all hop on a private jet.'","Lord Mitchell says he no longer backs £42billion project .

Last night Occupy protesters invaded New York City's Brooklyn Bridge, marking two months since the birth of the movement that has rocked Wall Street and spread to the rest of the world. Invasion: Occupy protesters march above lanes of cars as they took over Brooklyn Bridge last night . Activists, led largely by banner-carrying union members, marched under the backdrop of a powerful light projection on the side of a nearby skyscraper that read: 'We are the 99 per cent'. It came after a day of clogged streets and tied up traffic across Manhattan, as thousands jammed into Foley Square before and marched into the subway as part of a planned 'day of national action'. The protest continued into the early hours of this morning until 100 people were left in Zuccotti Park. A rally is planned for Friday against the oppression of the Muslim community in the city. Police officers last night arrested protesters who walked out onto the bridge’s roadway but otherwise let the marchers pass without incident on the pedestrian promenade.

Illuminated: A 99% light projection was cast on a building as Occupy Wall Street protesters marched last night . The demonstrations came two days after police raided and demolished the encampment at lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park that had served as headquarters of the Occupy movement. Thursday’s march followed a demonstration earlier in the day near the New York Stock Exchange. Chanting 'All day, all week, shut down Wall Street,' more than 1,000 protesters gathered there. 'You do not have a parade permit! You are blocking the street!' a police officer told protesters through a loudspeaker. The congestion brought taxis and delivery trucks to a halt. Helmeted police officers broke up some of the gatherings, and operations at the stock market were not disrupted. At least 300 people were arrested in New York.","Stacey Hessler, 38, left family behind in DeLand, Florida, to go to New York .

Manchester is known for its murky skies and greying buildings, but something else up there is turning a little off-white, too.... its women's underpants. The city has been outed as capital with the most greying underwear, with women admitting that 12 pairs of their 18 white knickers have seen brighter days. Meanwhile, down in London, women are better at keeping their undies sparkling (or better at lying), with girls in the capital saying only three of their average 18 pairs aren't as crisp and white as they once were. Manchester vs London: The North South divide comes into play in the white-off . The nationwide study of 1,500 women revealed that the average adult female in the UK owns 18 items of white underwear, with many of these beginning to look grey over time, due primarily to being  washed incorrectly or simply being old. And it appears there's a clear north-south divide when it comes to white underwear having passed its heyday. In Southampton just 18 per cent of ladies' white undies are greyed out. But up in Glasgow, from a collection of 18 items of white underwear, 59 per cent are not whiter than white. Birmingham, in the heart of the midlands, is closer to the south in its grey underwear count - with ladies owning a white underwear collection that has just 29 per cent greyed content. White or grey? Whites go grey if washed at the wrong temperature and with other, non-white, clothing items . Maybe the statistics can be explained by how much the owners of the smalls wash their underwear - Mancunian women are the most fervent when it comes to washing their smalls, clocking up an average of three loads per week. Londoners, however, are not quite so committed in the laundry room, with ladies living in the capital opting for just a single underwear wash per week. Susan Fermor, spokesman  for Dr Beckmann who carried out the research, said: 'Women in Manchester have the greyest white underwear in the UK. But it seems it is mainly due to the fact that they are the most evangelistic about washing their smalls. 'Unfortunately, they are almost certainly washing them at the wrong temperature, too often and possibly with other, non-white, clothing items which are affecting the brightness of their whites over time. 'They should maybe consider using a whitening product in their wash from time to time to correct the adverse effects of the washing cycle on their smalls.' 1.    Manchester (66 per cent)2.    Glasgow (59 per cent)3.    Liverpool (50 per cent)4.    Sheffield (45 per cent)5.    Stoke (38 per cent) 1.    London (84 per cent)2.    Oxford (80 per cent)3.    Bournemouth (72 per cent)4.    Brentwood (69 per cent)5.    Northampton (65 per cent)","Women in UK own 18 pairs of white underpants, on average .

Evan Williams, co-founder of the microblog site, has put his home on the market after four years and is set to make a $600,000 profit on the modest-looking property. Last year Mr Williams enraged neighbours in another San Francisco neighbourhood when he announced plans to demolish another $3million house and build an ‘eco-home’. Bird's nest: Twitter co-foudner Evan Williams is selling this San Francisco property for just under $3million - a sale which is set to put him $600,000 in the green . In 2012, the social-media multi-millionaire filed a planning application to tear down a historic building worth millions to replace it with a ‘zero-net energy’ house. More than 240 objections were lodged against the project, with some neighbours calling it ‘criminal’ to demolish the 5,000 square-foot Louis Christian Mullgardt designed house. The property currently on the market is another pet-project for Mr Williams, who is the man behind several social media companies, including Blogger. Mr Williams and his wife bought the home in Noe Valley in 2009 for $2.4million, and have since remodelled the house. Media man: Mr Williams, who was named CEO of Twitter on its launch in 2007, has founded several social media companies, including Blogger and current publishing project Medium . Hashtag home: The Noe Valley property is on the market for $2,995,000 and has three floors, four bedrooms, a roof terrace and a guest house .

A two-year-old girl died in hospital because doctors refused to immediately carry out a brain scan, her parents told an inquest yesterday. Alice Mason had successfully undergone treatment for a brain tumour two months before she was taken to Kingston Hospital in Surrey, with vomiting and fever. She died one week later. Rosalind and Gareth Mason alleged that staff refused to carry out scans on their daughter, deeming them unnecessary. They claimed nine chances to act on her symptoms were missed. Death: Alice Mason had successfully undergone treatment for a brain tumour two months before she was taken to Kingston Hospital in Surrey, with vomiting and fever . By the time tests were finally carried out it was too late to save her, West London Coroner's Court heard. Alice died on March 31 2011, from irreversible brain damage caused by water on the brain. Her parents, who are now suing the hospital, said the last time she was conscious she was clutching her head and crawling up and down her hospital bed in pain. Former City trader Mrs Mason, 46, of Wimbledon, south-west London, who is married to education expert Mr Mason, said: ‘It is not just that she died - the question is, could she have been saved?’ The inquest into Alice's death yesterday heard from junior doctor Dr Sharon Jheeta, who cared for her for two days, and said she was not initially told of the need for a brain scan. Dr Jheeta told the hearing: ‘I was under the impression this was a follow up scan rather than an emergency. I hadn't even heard about it until two days after Alice had been admitted.’ The doctor, who had been working on the ward for two weeks, said her only contact with Alice was to write up the consultant's notes. Treatment: Rosalind and Gareth Mason alleged that staff at Kingston Hospital (pictured) in Surrey refused to carry out scans on their daughter, deeming them unnecessary . Initially doctors thought the toddler . was suffering from an infection, prescribed her antibiotics and . monitored her every four hours. Jeremy Hyam, representing the Mason family, said the girl’s symptoms suggested she could have a neurological condition. ‘Could that have been a differential diagnosis to infection?’ he asked Dr Jheeta. She replied: ‘Yes, but that was not the top diagnosis from the team.’ 'It is not just that she died - the question is, could she have been saved?' Rosalind Mason, mother . Alice's parents claim Dr Jheeta refused to order the scan, even though she claimed she did not have the authority to do so. And they alleged that when they asked her what criteria Alice would have to meet to get the scan, the doctor refused to answer their questions. Disputing their version of events, the doctor said she could not recall such an incident, adding: ‘That doesn't sound like something I would do. I would have been quite happy to tell them.’ She said: ‘It was not my clinical decision. I wrote down notes as my consultant dictated. The only thing I would have said is my consultant doesn't believe the scan was needed at this time.’ The court was told that Mrs Mason was so upset by staff at the hospital that she had to leave on one occasion. The inquest was adjourned until October.","Alice Mason had been treated for brain tumour two months before .

Two con artists posed as a high-flying couple looking for a new home so they could find empty luxury accommodation to squat in, a court heard today. Married Richard and Hazel Jerome are accused of using the elaborate ruse to find out which high-value properties around the UK were sitting empty so they could move in quickly and live there rent free until they were forced out. A jury was today told how the couple had already been convicted for a similar stunt in Cambridgeshire when they decided to embark on another property scam in Devon - changing their names so sellers wouldn't read about them in the press. The Jeromes, of Chacombe, Oxon, are now on trial at Exeter Crown Court where they have denied eight fraud charges. Con artists: Richard and Hazel Jerome, who were convicted of fraud in 2009 after posing as a rich couple looking for a new home so they could find empty properties to squat in, are accused of carrying out the same scam in a different part of Britain . Prosecutor Peter Combe told the jury: 'The two defendants are habitual confidence tricksters.' He said they have developed a ruse where they pose as rich cash buyers of upmarket properties and end up living in them rent free until they are eventually forced out. He said: 'They pose as a wealthy couple who are interested in buying expensive properties.' He said 65-year-old Richard Jerome, known as Rick, pretends to have ‘substantial business interests abroad’ while his wife, 63-year-old Hazel, is a retired schoolteacher. The jury was told how the couple have already been convicted for carrying out incredibly similar housing fraud after a court case held at Huntingdon Crown Court in 2009. The court heard how after posing as a wealthy couple, they made cash offers on two expensive houses which were on sale with vacant possession. Then they would spin tales and lies as they explained delays in the house purchase - and ask to rent in the interim but never handed over any money. The Jeromes have previously been convicted for living rent-free in this house Bradville Milton Keynes for a year . The jury heard that one couple from this previous scam lost £167,000 on the value of the property and unpaid bills and rent. Jerome . was jailed for 15 months after he admitted fraud and deception while . his wife was given a ten month suspended term after she too admitted . fraud. Mr Combe said they used the same methods when they turned their attention to the West country. The court heard that in East Looe, . Cornwall, the Jeromes claimed they wanted to buy a house for their base . in the UK because they lived for six months each year in Barbados. They made an offer of £310,000 on the property but then blamed delays on Jerome being seriously ill and his recuperation. Convicted: Fraudsters Richard and Hazel Jerome pictured in 2009 when they were first convicted for operating the property scam . But Mr Combe said when they made that offer they had already pleaded not guilty to the frauds in the Huntington case. The prosecutor said it was ‘somewhat surprising’ they could splash out £310,000 on the house when they had three county court judgements against them for various sums of money. He said the Jeromes ‘work together’ and Rich Jerome ‘takes the lead and does the talking’ but Hazel Jerome plays her part as they tell vendors about their ‘fantastical lifestyle’. The court heard the purchase of the Cornish house was still going on when the couple later admitted the fraud in Huntingdon crown court. The seller then read about the Jeromes' fiddle in newspapers and baled out without losing too much money on the deal. The Jeromes then turned their attention to another property in Sidmouth, Devon - one on a cliff top with lovely sea views. But this time they allegedly used a false surname - Ausson - so the seller wouldn't hear of the court case. They again posed as a wealthy couple with international business interests with a cash deal for the £750,000 property - not long after Jerome had been released from jail. The court heard they wanted to complete the deal in two and a half weeks but then made another series of excuses for delays and problems blaming solicitors and illness. But a surveyor they used and failed to pay for his work discovered their real identities and alerted the various parties and the police became involved again. The Jeromes were arrested at their home. Jerome questioned why police wanted his passport saying that he had not been abroad for two years - despite telling vendors that he was a high flier travelling around the world constantly. Police also recovered bank statements which showed he never had more than £200 in his account. He refused to comment in police interviews while his wife denied being involved in any fraud and said she lived off her State pension and her school teacher pension. She said they had looked to buy a retirement home in the West country for £300,000 or more and was told by her husband that his off shore company would making the purchase. Target: The couple have also previously been convicted of squatting for six months in this cottage in Stoke Hammond, Buckinghamshire . The court was also told how private school headteacher Diane Gardner was duped into handing Jerome £10,000 after meeting him through a dating website. Miss Gardner, from Camberley, Surrey, said: 'He told me that he was divorced. He said he worked in the money markets and said that he had been in the RAF and worked for Rank Zerox all around the world.' She said they first met on line in 2003 but they only met in person six to eight times in five years. She said he told her he needed some money to finalise a deal and she ‘stupidly’ gave him £4,400. She gave Jerome a further £5,000 to help her set up a mortgage - but she ended up doing it herself and never saw the cash again. She called him ‘extremely plausible’ but she never got her money back even when she asked for it. She told Exeter Crown Court: 'I loaned him a total in excess of £10,000 and got none of it back. It was probably more. I felt completely foolish.' The Jeromes deny eight joint fraud charges in Cornwall, Devon and Northamptonshire. The trial continues.

A high school math teacher who had his license suspended for sending text messages to students discussing their sexual experiences is to be allowed to return to the classroom at the start of the next school year. George C. Merk was originally suspended from his job at Lakota West High School in Cincinatti, Ohio, for 10 days in March 2012 after an internal investigation into 'unacceptable, insubordinate, deceitful and unprofessional' behaviour. According to Cincinatti.com, he 'admitted' to communicating with students over text message and other means on their 'sexual orientation and sexual experiences' Back to class: Teacher George C. Merk will return to teaching next term despite having his license suspended after having inappropriate communication with pupils at Lakota West High School, pictured, via text message . His five-year teaching license was suspended for a further 45 days last month after he signed an agreement with the Ohio Department of Education as part of the investigation. The agreement also bans him from contacting students via Facebook or text message, requires quarterly reports regarding his conduct and will see him undergo training on student/teacher boundaries. Mr Merk's actions did not warrant criminal investigation said West Chester Township Police. The 41-year-old teacher's lawyer Julie Ford said that Mr Merk only signed the agreement with the Ohio Department of Education's Office of Professional Conduct to 'put this matter behind him and avoid any delays in the renewals of his current teaching licenses' rather than as an admission of any wrongdoing. Probe: Mr Merk reached an agreement with the Ohio Department of Education after an investigation into his conduct . During an initial investigation by school officials in February last year, Mr Merk is said to have denied 'receiving a picture of a condom box through text message from a student.' School Superintendent Karen Mantia wrote at the time: 'This behaviour us unacceptable and will not be tolerated.' A report was then submitted to the state's Department of Education office with a full investigation culminating in the agreement last month. According to The Journal, Mr Merk also failed to report that a student was bullied and posted Facebook statuses about students' academic levels and disparaging the school's administration. Mr Merk has worked at the school since 2002 and earns just over $66,000 a year. His file shows no evidence of any other transgressions during his career and he is regarded as having performed well at the school.","George C Merk was originally suspended for 10 days in March 2012 .

Dave McLuckie, the former chairman of Cleveland Policy Authority, has been jailed for eight months for getting a friend to take speeding points for him . A former police chief who persuaded a friend to take speeding points for him so he wouldn't miss out on the top job has been jailed for eight months. Dave McLuckie, 52, was on the brink of becoming the chairman of Cleveland Police Authority when asked his friend Maurice Ward for a 'big favour' to help him avoid a driving ban in 2005. He had been caught by a speed camera doing 36mph in a 30mph zone in his black Peugeot and already had nine points on his licence. McLuckie's crime only came to light following a fall-out with Mr Ward, who became ill with cancer two years later and felt his friend had not visited him enough. Mr Ward, who died in January last year, wrote a note stating that he had taken the points for McLuckie, which was discovered by his widow after his death. Mr Ward's daughter Donna told a local councillor about her discovery and the police were informed. McLuckie, from Great Ayton, North Yorkshire, denied perverting the course of justice but was convicted at Newcastle Crown Court last month. He told the court that the Ward family was driven by malice but did not specifically deny being the driver. The disgraced police chief claimed he had . spoken to Mr Ward who agreed he had probably been driving the car . on that occasion. Passing sentence, Judge David Wood told McLuckie: 'This offence does really strike at the heart of the legal system.' He said he had to give McLuckie a prison term despite the excellent . references McLuckie had put forward, and being a man of 'exemplary . character'. 'This case is not really about penalty . points, it’s about justice and equality before the law. You are not . entitled to avoid the law or interfere with the course of justice.' The judge did not impose a driving ban and said Mr Ward would have received the same prison sentence if he were still alive. Julian Smith, defending, said McLuckie . had stepped down as a councillor at Redcar and Cleveland Council and . from voluntary organisations he represented. He has been suspended from his managerial role at a potash mine, and was on gardening leave. A judge at Newcastle Crown Court told McLuckie that he was not entitled to avoid the law . McLuckie realised he might not have a future with the company where he has worked for 31 years, he said. Mr Smith said McLuckie’s own 'poignant' assessment of the case was that 'it has destroyed everything I have ever been'. Mr Ward’s handwritten note said: . 'DM caught speeding Carlin How 15-4-2005. 3 points penalty. 12.16pm . 36mph. Took my licence in himself to pay. 'He had called at my house on . 28-4-2005 at 8.50. He had a coffee and asked me if I would lend him my . licence to get 3 points deducted to help him get the post of Chairman of . Cleveland Police which I did.' McLuckie was still under investigation by Operation Sacristy - an inquiry into alleged corruption within Cleveland Police - which has caused him regional notoriety, and will make his time in prison difficult, his barrister said. 'That is likely to attract the wrong kind of attention, that is a matter about which he is understandably concerned,' Mr Smith said. As he was led from court, McLuckie blew a kiss and said 'Love you' to his partner in the public gallery. Today, the Crown Prosecution Service said that Mr Ward's guilty conscience made him write the note. Gerry Sydenham, head of the Crown Court Unit at CPS North East, said: 'Mr Ward became increasingly troubled by his part in this and, while suffering from a fatal illness, he wrote a note to his family to clear his conscience. 'That short note prompted the criminal prosecution that led to McLuckie’s sentence today and I would hope that today’s result gives some measure of closure to Mr Ward’s family.'","Dave McLuckie, 52, asked his friend Maurice Ward to take points in 2005 .

The latest device promising to give you sparkling, snowy-white teeth is The £45 Whitening Wand . A dazzling white smile is a prerequisite for any celebrity hoping to make it to the red . carpet. After all, they don't call it a Hollywood smile for nothing. But not everyone can afford the mega-watt A-list look - so they are settling for a rush hour grin instead. The latest device promising to give you sparkling, snowy-white teeth on the go is The Whitening Wand -- a £45 treatment that has already been snapped up by thousands of commuters. Dubbed 'the magic wand', the creation claims to be ideal for those looking to whiten their teeth on their morning commute. Developed by Dr Joe Oliver of London's Welbeck Clinic, the Whitening Wand is applied after the morning brush after which it needs to be left for at least 30 minutes to take effect. After two weeks of treatment, the wand - which contains hydrogen peroxide to cut through tooth stains - claims to make teeth four shades lighter than their original colour. And it may cost £45 for just two treatments but that hasn't deterred 2,000 Brits from snapping it up on the first day of sale. Since then more stocks have been added both online and in stores like beauty chain Space NK. Speaking about his brainchild, Dr Oliver said: 'Whitening teeth is now part of our beauty and grooming regime. 'However there wasn’t anything on the market which could be used in the customer’s time that was convenient. 'Most treatments involve using light-activating devices which means not only an unpleasant experience but . you’d have to allow an hour a day to use the treatment. 'In this current climate we . understand that people are time poor. We wanted to launch a product . which would show the same results but be used in the comfort of everyday . lives and while on the move.' Dr Mervyn Druian, Co-Founder of The London Centre for Cosmetic Dentistry, said: 'It appears that the magic wand should be safe, but I’m not sure how effective it is. 'The jury is out for now- look back in 6 months and see if it is still as popular; that’s a good indicator of how effective it actually is. 'The in-surgery tooth whitening treatment along with the home whitening  trays have been proven over and over again to be consistently effective. 'I would highly recommend this type of whitening treatment.' Food and drink as well as poor . cleaning, smoking and other factors can affect natural tooth colour and . stains built up over time. And clearly the colour of our pearly whites is a major concern for image conscious Brits - and it's big business too. By 2009, UK sales of . whitening toothpastes had increased by 15 per cent, rising from . £55 million in 2006 to £63 million in 2008.

With the birth of the Royal baby set to happen any day now, Kate and William may be hoping their newborn is a girl if the latest research is anything to go by. British parents have revealed that their darling offspring are costing them a King’s ransom in replacing and repairing everyday items and it's little boys who are the biggest culprits. According to the latest research, boys under the age of five cause over three times more damage than girls in the home. Boys cause over three times more damage than girls in the home and it's 2-year-olds who are the most troublesome . Additionally, almost half of parents stated that two-year-olds are deemed to be the biggest culprits of accidental damage to items. When it came to calculating the average cost of damage caused by curiously-minded kids, parents estimated they had to fork out up to £1,764 each replacing and repairing broken items during their child’s first five years. This is the equivalent of buying a one week family holiday for two adults and one toddler in Spain. A third of parents polled said their children damaged goods by dropping or smashing them, and over a quarter said their child had ruined household items by spilling a drink on something. Parents fork out up to £1,764 each replacing and repairing broken items during their child’s first five years- that's the same price as the average family holiday . Gareth Lane, Head of Home Insurance at Confused.com, who carried out the survey, said: 'Our advice to new parents is to toddler proof their home and keep a particularly watchful eye out - especially if the baby is a boy. The regions where children caused the most damage include, in order of rank: . 1. London (23.85 per cent) 2. North West (12.70 per cent) 3. West Midlands (10.15 per cent) 4. Yorkshire & The Humber (9.90 per cent) 5. South West (8.95 per cent) 'As our research shows, breakages caused by children happen all the time. 'With the right preventative measures such as keeping pricey items out of sight and out of reach from children (and adding cover for accidental damage to your home contents insurance policy) parents will be less out of pocket.' The research also found the top five items that proud new parents may have to replace, including damaged clothing (30 per cent), blemished walls painted or wallpapered (28 per cent), spoiled jewellery (23 per cent), smashed ornaments (22 per cent) and a broken phone (21 per cent). The most expensive ruined goods include gadgets such as a tablet, laptop or computer with over a third of parents citing these as the most costly possessions needing replacement as a result of their offspring's handiwork. When it came to finding out which region’s children caused the most domestic havoc, almost a quarter of London’s toddlers caused damage, compared to well-behaved youngsters in Northern Ireland who ranked in at just under 2 per cent.","Boys are more accident prone than girls .

Donna Fallon was a 'normal', 40-year-old housewife and mother-of-three when she discovered her psychic powers. The softly-spoken Liverpudlian was informed she had the gift by a medium, while being given a reading of her own, and immediately began testing it out. Now aged 49 and living in Cambridgeshire, Donna has spent the last nine years building a trusted client base of people who visit her for spiritual meetings with departed loved ones, tarot card readings and soul healing sessions. And it's a list that includes celebrity faces such as former-TOWIE star Amy Childs, former-WAG Lizzie Cundy and former-EastEnder Cheryl Fergison, Tamara Eccleston and Colleen Rooney. Psychic and medium Donna Fallon, left, has a celebrity client base that includes former-TOWIE star Amy Childs, right . 'Everyone comes to see me for different reasons,' Donna told MailOnline. 'And all sessions are different, depending on why they are there. 'I tend to begin sessions by asked their loved ones in the spirit world why they have come, as that's often the best way.' Donna - who last night tweeted a photograph of herself with Amy Childs after giving her a reading - says she would never reveal anything about her clients, or what happens during a session. 'I do have a lot of celebrity clients, including several people from the TOWIE cast, and they often recommend me to other celebrities, but I would never speak about what happens in the sessions. Amy is a lovely girl.' 'People may come because they're wondering about their job, or their relationship, or they want to speak to loved ones who have passed away. 'Most people want a bit of guidance and direction in their lives. I never tell anyone what to do or if they are going to die. Life is so full of trauma anyway - I want to give them hope.' Donna tweeted a photo of herself with Amy Childs after giving the former-TOWIE star a reading in her home last night . Donna describes herself as 'a spiritual supermarket', saying: 'You can come to me for spiritual messages, tarot readings and soul healings. All three in one place!' She says she has spoken to a woman who miscarried, and told her precisely when she would fall pregnant again; she has helped one mother grieve over a young son lost in the Hillsborough disaster, by carrying messages between them; and she allowed one woman to forgive herself for not being by her mother's side when she died, because her mother appeared to Donna and told her it was OK. Donna with former-WAG Lizzie Cundy, one of the celebrities she has done readings for . When asked why she won't give people direct advice about what to do in life, Donna explains that 'there has to be free will', adding: 'I can give them only guidance. Maybe I'll see their loved one who will tell them they're stuck in a rut, but I can't lead people into decisions that might be wrong. 'A woman who came to see me yesterday said the last psychic she'd seen had told her to break up with her boyfriend. I didn't see that at all, and I certainly wouldn't have told her if I had! It might have been the biggest mistake of her life.' Donna - pictured with former EastEnder Cheryl Fergison - says she will never actually tell people what to do with their lives, as there needs to be an element of free will . Donna gives readings in an annexe of her house in Cambridgeshire, thus enabling her to keep her work and personal lives separate. But juggling the roles of psychic and mother hasn't always been easy. When she first began doing readings Donna's son, now 16, asked 'why I couldn't work in Tesco like all the other mums'. But now they're older - her other children are 21 and 18 - they are very supportive of what she does. 'I support Everton so do charity readings at matches, and now my son is pleased he gets free merchandise!' Donna with ex-Coronation Street actress Gaynor Faye, who has received readings from the psychic, left, and Donna outside her beloved Liverpool FC, right . But when it comes to reading her own family, Donna is hesitant. 'I never do readings for my husband or family: emotion clouds judgement. I did tarot with my eldest daughter once to give her some direction, and I do my husband once a year, but I don't tune into my kids. 'They have to be allowed to have secrets, there has to be something personal. To my kids I'm just mum, and we're the last people to know if they have a girlfriend or boyfriend!' Donna is now planning on running spiritual retreats to teach people how to give readings. For more information visit her website .","Donna Fallon, 49, is from Liverpool and lives in Cambridgeshire .

Ethiopian runner Meskerem Legesse, 26, of Westport, Connecticut was with her two-year-old son at a Chinese restaurant on the 900 block of Dixwell Ave in Hamden eating lunch when she collapsed on Monday. The eight-months pregnant Legesse was given CPR at the restaurant before an ambulance rushed her to Yale-New Haven Hospital. Tragedy: Meskerem Legesse gave up running after finding out she had heart problems . Pregnant mother: Security camera footage shows Legesse arriving at the restaurant and sitting down before moments later keeling over . Hamden Fire Chief David Berardesca says CPR efforts in the restaurant and ambulance allowed doctors to save the baby. The Courant is reporting the young mother died of a massive heart attack, though no autopsy has been performed. A friend, Fatima Sene, said the athlete had heart problems which were the cause of her retirement from sport. Sene told WFSB that the marathon runner was so careful during her pregnancy that she drank nothing but water and ate extremely healthily. Homesick: Legesse hadn't been back to Ethipia in nine years and was planning a visit after the birth of her daughter . 'She always tried to eat healthy and she always makes sure her son eats good,' she said. 'I just don’t know what to say.' WFSB reports Legesse had not been back to Ethiopia in nine years and was waiting for the birth of her second child so she could finally visit. 'She was so excited,' Sene told WFSB about Legesse's pregnancy. 'When she found out she was going to have a girl, she called me.' Happy: Legesse had been excitedly awaiting the birth of her first daughter when she died on Monday . 'She wanted to see her mother, so I want to get her home,' Sene said. 'I want to make sure she goes home.' 'It is very sad. She was a very good person,' Sene the Star Tribune. 'She would do anything for anybody. And she loved that little boy she left behind.' Sene said that Legesse's two-year-old son and the newborn baby are with their father. According to the Star Tribune, the state medical examiner's office has declined to perform an autopsy, citing Legesse's past health problems. Arrangements are being made to transport Legesse's body to Ethiopia for burial. Legesse ran the 1,500 meters at the Athens Olympics in 2004. She finished 12th in a first-round heat with a time of 4:18:03 and didn't advance to the medal race. She moved on to a professional running career in the U.S., competing in events including the Boston Indoor Games, Fifth Avenue Mile in Manhattan and the Millrose Games in New York.

In the security video Kyle McCartin was seen smiling and pointing his gun at the shop assistant while shirtless . McCartin and his companion arrived at the shop in Tuscon in the early hours of Tuesday morning, allegedly drunk . McCartin is facing charges of aggravated assault after he was pictured recklessly waving his gun around a shop . McCartin was told to put the gun down by his friend but is seen on security footage pointing the gun back at the shop assistant, seemingly unprovoked. Sheriff's investigators said McCartin did not make any demands of the clerk, and the pair paid for their purchases. The pair then fled on foot but were caught by McCartin's colleagues at a nearby apartment complex. McCartin was arrested and charged at the Pima County Jail on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. McCartin's friend persuaded him to stop pointing the weapon at the shop assistant as he paid for their purchases . However, moments later McCartin was once more pointing the gun at the shop assistant . Tucson Police issued a statement to clarify that McCartin has since been fired following a brief investigation. He had only been with the department for 10 months and was on probationary status at the time. Deputy Jesus Banuelos from Pima County .

Male-only golf clubs are ‘for some people a way of life that they rather like’, the head of the sport’s governing body insisted yesterday. Peter Dawson, chief executive of the Royal and Ancient, said ahead of today’s 142nd British Open at Muirfield in East Lothian, that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs. The Open Championship is being held at the famous course in Scotland, where women are banned from being members - causing a controversy threatening to overshadow the competition. 'A way of life': Peter Dawson, chief executive of the Royal and Ancient, said ahead of today's 142nd British Open at Muirfield in East Lothian, Scotland, that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs . Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Sport Minister Hugh Robertson have all announced they will boycott this week’s golf for its perceived sexism. But Mr Dawson yesterday defended the course’s ban on women, saying: ‘I really don’t think that a golf club that has a policy of being a place where like-minded men or indeed women go, play golf together and do their thing together, ranks up against some of these other forms of discrimination. ‘For some people, it is a way of life they rather like. I don’t think they are intending to do others down. You can dress it up to be a lot more if you want. No women in sight: England's Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and England's Matthew Fitzpatrick on the 4th during practice day three for the 2013 Open Championship at Muirfield Golf Club, East Lothian, on Tuesday . ‘But if on a Sunday morning the guy, or . the lady, gets out of the marital bed, if you like, and plays golf with . his chums and comes back in the afternoon - that is not on any kind of . par with racial discrimination or anti-Semitism.’ He added: ‘We do believe that . membership policy is a matter for clubs. And it will take a lot to push . us off that position. We happen to believe that very strongly.’ But Mr Dawson was forced to concede that the issue of single-sex clubs would be re-examined. With the eyes of the world on Scotland, Mr Dawson said it would be a ‘hard push’ to change the Royal and Ancient’s policy but accepted the issue of single-sex clubs had become ‘divisive’. He added: ‘It’s a subject that we’re finding increasingly difficult, to be honest. Single-sex clubs are in a very small minority in the UK. Male-only club: Golf fans make their way across the 18th fairway during practice day four for the 2013 Open Championship at Muirfield Golf Club in East Lothian . 'Half of them are women-only, half . are men-only. They’re perfectly legal. In our view, they don’t do anyone . any harm and we think the right of freedom of association is . important.’ But he said he understood the view . that three male-only clubs - Muirfield, Royal Troon in Ayrshire and . Royal St George’s in Kent - should not be listed among the nine courses . which host the Open. At Muirfield, women can play only as a . guest of a member or by booking tee-time in advance as a visitor. They . have been banned by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers for 269 . years. Laura Davies, the . most successful British woman player of modern times, said this week it . was time Muirfield caught up with the 21st century. A . Muirfield Club spokesman said: ‘We conform to the Equality Act 2010 and . any change in the membership would be for the members to decide. There . are no plans to change the current membership status.’ Muirfield Golf Club has brought the debate into the public mind as it is hosting the Open this year. The club has a male-only policy . Muirfield is a privately owned course which is the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. Established in 1744 in Gullane, Scotland, Muirfield has hosted The Open Championship fifteen times, most recently in 2002 when Ernie Els lifted the trophy. Single-sex clubs are not illegal in Britain and exist in the golfing world and other sports and social situations but opponents have accused them of being outdated and out-of-touch. Though women can play the course as guests or visitors they are barred from holding membership of Muirfield. But one source told the Daily telegraph: ‘The notion of women members is talked about openly now, rather than in whispers. It is not a case of if any longer, but when.’ The issue of single sex golf clubs has become huge in the golfing world, but the club maintains that its policy is to ask their members before changing. There are about 3,000 courses in Britain. Around about 1% of them have a single sex membership policy. Of that 1% or so, half of them, slightly more than half, are women-only clubs in BritainHistorically these clubs were first formed, because they couldn't get into the men's clubs at that time . Supporters of single-sex clubs have said that members of these clubs don't want to change. Members of both men’s and women’s clubs are very happy with the policy. In April Peter Dawson said in a statement : ‘Why should perhaps 5,000 members of these various clubs change something that they're very happy with? 'And I don't know who could make that happen, because the feeling is very strong here, that this works, this model here at St Andrews works.’","Peter Dawson insists that it's not sexist to exclude women from clubs .

Never in the Liberal Democrats’ wildest dreams would one of their party political broadcasts have gone viral to a global audience. But then, never in their wildest dreams would it have involved Nick Clegg singing ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so, so sorry’, over and over again. The Deputy Prime Minister’s attempt to apologise for his tuition fees U-turn backfired spectacularly yesterday, after his sombre televised address ended up in the hands of internet satirists. Scroll down to watch the video remix . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg filmed his apology video at his home in Putney, West London . The autotune remix of Nick Clegg's speech got some people thinking that if it all goes wrong in 2015 he could always try a career in music. A rash of Twitter hashtags including #CleggBoybands and #CleggSongs made hilarious suggestions for band names and lyrics: . @OwenJones84: Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it . @reporterboy: Let's Stick to Teather . @Markfergusonuk Don't blame it on the sunshine, don't blame it on the moonlight, don't blame it on the good times, blame it on the Tories . @PatJHennessy: Mings Can Only Get Better . @guywalters: 'No Direction' @PaulGoodmanCH: I fought the Laws and the Laws won. @curseofham: I Believe In A Man Called Gove . @BarryWhiteStuff: Oh Danny Boy . @DavidMills73 Return to Grender . @RichardLucas3: Uncomfortably Glum . @grvlx001: Marilyn Mansion Tax . @1968bonner: Depressed Mode . @Samuelsdale: The Charlatans . They turned his apology into a music . video, setting his words to an up-tempo beat, and using autotune . software to alter his voice so it appeared as though he were singing. The spoof, made by satirical website The Poke, rapidly went viral, with thousands of viewers watching it around the world. Many took the opportunity to mock the . Liberal Democrat leader by leaving comments on YouTube. One wrote: ‘When . I make a promise I keep to it, and I promise I will never vote for . you’. Another posted: ‘Clegg could be the . founder member of a new boy band – you could call it No Direction.’ Activists on grassroots website LibDemVoice were equally hostile. One branded the video ‘utterly . cringe-making’, while another said:  ‘All in all a dreadful mess. The . web is already full of videos of Nick’s speech set to music. ‘The problem is – and I voted Lib Dem – they are funny and make Nick look silly. He looks like a lost little boy.’ With the spoof video rapidly . threatening to overshadow his apology completely, Mr Clegg tried to . salvage something from the situation by agreeing to let The Poke release . the song as a charity single. Responding to the website’s request on . Twitter, Mr Clegg said ‘permission granted’, as long as the proceeds . went to Sheffield Children’s Hospital, of which his wife Miriam is a . patron. Bookmakers now believe the single could top the charts. In the video, made for a party . political broadcast to be screened on Monday, Mr Clegg says the Lib Dems . were wrong to sign a pre-election pledge that they would oppose any . rise in tuition fees, only to break it a few months later by backing a . Coalition move to treble fees to £9,000 a year. Mr Clegg’s belated . apology was widely seen as an attempt to reassert his grip on the party, . amid mounting unease about his dire personal poll ratings. But it also reopened the row over the decision, which many Lib Dems saw as a betrayal by the leadership. Nick Clegg used Twitter to confirm the song could be released as a single . Business Secretary Vince Cable . appeared to undermine Mr Clegg by saying he had been ‘personally . sceptical’ about the ‘unaffordable’ pledge, even before the election. Mr Cable, widely tipped as the party’s . next leader if Mr Clegg is forced out before the election, denied the . pledge had been a pre-election stunt. He said the party had been ‘badly . punished’ for breaking it and had ‘lost a lot trust’. ‘It has been damaging – that is why Nick is speaking in such heartfelt terms,’ he said. He confirmed that Treasury chief . secretary Danny Alexander had also warned Mr Clegg to abandon the . commitment on tuition fees before the election. But Mr Cable acknowledged that he and . other senior Lib Dems had to take ‘collective responsibility’ for going . into the election with an ‘unaffordable’ policy. Right behind you: Vince Cable (right) said he supported Nick Clegg's apology, admitting he was 'sceptical' about the Lib Dems' tuition fees pledge . There were angry protests in Westminster at the move to increase tuition fees to £9,000 a year . Last year Mr Clegg told his conference the party had ‘nothing to apologise for’. But pensions minister Steve Webb yesterday said it had become clear that a public apology was essential. ‘Over the summer we found that . although we have got loads of things we want to talk about on tax and . the environment sometimes that is landing on deaf ears, because people . say, “hang on, what about tuition fees?”,’ he said. Aides to Mr Clegg last night insisted . that his decision to issue an apology had been ‘vindicated’, with a . senior source saying he had been amused by the spoof video. ‘Nick saw it and he thought that it . was very funny,’ the source said. ‘But he also thinks it is an – . admittedly unusual – way of getting the message out to more people. ‘That was the idea of doing the apology in the first place.’","Nick Clegg's party political broadcast admitting he was wrong to promise to block an increase in fees gets a musical makeover .

Two British women are under arrest in Brazil after attempting to smuggle £170,000 worth of cocaine to the UK. The 23-year-olds hid 7.7lbs of the class-A drug in their suitcases and tried to board a flight to Britain. Police detained the pair after sniffer dogs detected the drugs at a boarding gate at San Paulo Airport on Monday morning. Smugglers caught: The pair were attempting to board a plane leaving Sao Paulo (pictured) with 7.7lbs of cocaine but were sniffed out at the gate by dogs . Detectives opened their luggage to find the cocaine hidden in in small plastic bags within the lining of their cases. Last night the unnamed women were being held in a nearby jail ahead of an appearance before an investigating judge. They face between 20 and 25 years in jail if convicted of drugs smuggling. Police said the women have told them they bought the cocaine in the city of Rio Branco, the capital of the Amazon state of Acre which serves as a major conduit for cocaine trafficking from nearby Peru. The border city was the launch pad in Brazil for lethal cocaine derivative oxi, dubbed the drug of death, which contains chemicals including kerosene and battery fluid and kills most users within a year. Drugs uncovered: The pair hid 3.5 kilos of cocaine in plastic bags within the lining of their suitcases (file photo) A spokesman for Brazil's Policia Federal said: ‘The PF has arrested two British women trying to board a flight to London with 3.5 kilos of cocaine. ‘They were stopped at the boarding gate after sniffer dogs detected the drugs in their luggage. ‘A number of small plastic bags containing the cocaine were hidden in the lining of the suitcases which according to the women, were acquired in the city of Rio Branco. ‘The suspects are now being dealt with by the judiciary who will be investigating them on suspicion of drugs trafficking. ‘They face a prison sentence of between 20 and 25 years if convicted.’ San Paulo's Guarulhos International Airport, the airport where the women were arrested, is the main exit point for people carrying cocaine from South America to the rest of the world. An average of five people a day are arrested for drugs trafficking. Snowy London: The young women were attempting to smuggle £170,000 worth of cocaine for the UK market . Less than a decade ago, only 40 foreign women were imprisoned in the entire state of San Paulo. But the number of arrests of foreign women has risen so dramatically that all such prisoners have moved to the San Paulo Capital Jail for Women where, at more than 400, they account for more than half the prison's population.

An international bidding war erupted for the rare bronze coin dating from 1793, the year the United States Mint first opened. The coin had been tipped to sell for around $4,560, but 10 keen bidders sent the price soaring at the Bonhams auction in London yesterday. A coin collector struck gold with the sale of a rare one-inch bronze coin dating from 1793 for $140,000 . Eventually an anonymous coin collector placed the winning bid - at more than 30 times the estimate. John Millenstead, head of coins and medals at Bonhams, said: 'Although the coin is quite rare and in good condition, we are slightly bewildered that it went for quite so much. 'There was a real frenzy at the auction with six people in the room and four more on the phones all wanting the coin. 'The US in the 1790s was not the country it is now, and so the amount of cents produced would have been relatively few. A highly competitive auction at Bonhams in Knightsbridge, London drove up the price to more than 30 times the expected sale price . In 1792 Congress called for the establishment of a national mint. Because Philadelphia was then the nation's capital, it was built there and it started producing coins in 1793. The one-inch coin features an image of Liberty on one side and a three leaf sprig on the other side. In today's money, one cent is worth just 0.6 of a penny. Mr Millenstead explained: 'Coins like this don't come up at auction very often and the fact it has survived all these years in good condition made it collectable. 'It seems sometimes when people set their heart on something they have to have it. Record sale: The 1933 Double Eagle gold coins were never lawfully issued, but were taken from the United States Mint at Philadelphia, and were bought for $7.6 million in 2002 . 'It also goes to show that it is worth checking your old coins.' Other big sellers at yesterday's auction in Knightsbridge included a collection of 19th and early 20th Century coins from China which went for $30,134, and a single gold Egyptian coin from the reign of Ptolemy VI in 180-145 BC that sold for $8,766. The record price among American coins belongs to the 1933 Double Eagle, the only legal copy of a coin that never made it into circulation.

Despite his energetic efforts to escape, it still took officers a taser and a projectile launcher to stop Brion Adam Kriss.

Officers from nearby South Bethany were drafted in to help find the car when it was spotted driving recklessly half an hour later. Patrol cars chased Kriss, who was thought to have been armed with a large knife, across the state line and into Ocean City, Maryland, where officers from the Ocean City Police Department joined in the chase.

Star violinist Nigel Kennedy has claimed children were subjected to sexual abuse at the elite music school he attended in Surrey. Mr Kennedy has said he knew Marcel Gazelle - the founding music director of the prestigious Yehudi Menuhin School - was a 'repeat offender', amid accusations the deceased pianist abused pupils as young as 10 during the 1960s. The acclaimed musician, 56, spoke out as a Channel 4 News investigation exposed allegations of sexual abuse and inappropriate behaviour at five of the UK's specialist music schools over a period of 40 years. 'Appalled': Violinist Nigel Kennedy was a student at the prestigious Yehudi Menuhin School during the 1960s, at the time the alleged abuse was taking place . It follows recent revelations of historic . sexual abuse at the world-renowned Chetham's School of Music in . Manchester. Mr Kennedy, who was a . pupil at the Yehudi Menuhin School during the 1960s, told Channel 4 News he was 'shook up . and appalled' by the allegations. Surrey Police confirmed they had been contacted about the allegations. The Menuhin School was founded in 1963 by Yehudi Menuhin with the help of his friend, pianist Gazelle. Channel . 4 News said they received allegations that Gazelle, who died in 1969 and who performed and . recorded with Mr Menuhin, sexually abused girls in bedrooms at the . school. 'I just know that Marcel Gazelle was a repeat offender and it wasn't a one-off thing,' Mr Kennedy told the broadcaster. 'It's . a disgrace really that people's trust has been abused in such a way... The children themselves, their trust, the parents' trust, people's . belief in music as being a pure form of art, [that] this whole ethos can . be abused by one sick selfish person is very, very disturbing.' Elite: Marcel Gazelle, the founding music director of the Yehudi Menuhin School in Cobham, Surrey, has been accused of abusing pupils as young as 10 during the 1960s . Irita Kutchmy, who studied with Gazelle from the age of nine to twelve, told the broadcaster his behaviour had a 'very detrimental' effect on her childhood. She said: 'I felt he was a very powerful person... I just remember feeling like I was sort of like his property, his pupil and therefore what he said went. 'It didn't appear to me to be weird that he came up to wake us up in the morning. It was just the way it was at the school... He would tickle me under the sheets... His hands were on my bare skin where they shouldn't be.' Gazelle's former pupil Irita Kutchmy . The programme has also spoken to two more women who claim Gazelle sexually abused them at the Yehudi Menuhin School. One of them says she reported his behaviour to the school at the time and was told to avoid being on her own with him. Marcel Gazelle's family said he was a good man and they were surprised by the allegations, which they dispute. The Yehudi Menuhin School said it was 'shocked and saddened to learn of the allegations'. The school told Channel 4 News: 'We have checked the records which survive from 50 years ago and can find nothing about any concerns expressed at the time. 'In accordance with our policies we have reported these serious allegations to Surrey Police.' Another woman who was a pupil at one of the music schools in the 1990s told the programme her teacher flirted with her frequently, before making a pass at her after a lesson at his home. She said: 'I can remember it very vividly. The lesson was over, I was leaving. He then shut the blinds in the front room, which I thought - well you know, that's a very odd thing to do - why would he do that? 'And his words were, ""I'm going to kick myself if I don't do this"" and proceeded to kiss me.' She said she lost her virginity to her teacher when she was just 17 years old. Abuse: The Channel 4 investigation follows recent revelations of historic sexual abuse at the world-renowned Chetham's School of Music in Manchester . At least three pupils at the same school say they were sexually involved with the same teacher, Channel 4 News reported. Abuse: Michael Brewer, a former music director at Chetham's, was labelled a 'predatory sex offender' and jailed for six years in March . The teacher no longer works at the school, though he continues to teach elsewhere, the programme said. Responding . to details of the programme's investigation, the music schools said the . welfare of their pupils was their overriding priority and that where . necessary they've contacted the police and the relevant authorities. The schools said the majority of the allegations were historic, that recent allegations have been dealt with appropriately and that they have confidence in their safeguarding procedures, which they say are under constant review. The three other schools were not named in the report for legal reasons. The former music director at prestigious Manchester school Chetham's, Michael Brewer, was labelled 'a predatory sex offender' and was sent to prison for six years earlier this year. His victims included ex-pupil Frances Andrade, 48, who he groomed for sex from the age of 14 and who went on to take her life at her home in Guildford, Surrey, during his trial. Surrey Police confirmed they have been contacted by the Yehudi Menuhin School following 'allegations of historic sexual abuse against a member of staff who is now deceased'. A spokesman said: 'The Force is liaising with the school and would encourage anyone with concerns to contact us. 'Surrey Police treats any allegation of this nature seriously and have officers who are specially trained to support victims of sexual assault.'

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has asked for temporary asylum in Russia after spending three weeks holed up at a Moscow airport trying to avoid prosecution in the United States on espionage charges, according to reports. Snowden is seeking refuge in Latin America after leaking details of U.S. government surveillance programmes, but has not risked taking any flight that might be intercepted by the United States since flying to Russia from Hong Kong on June 23. Russia's state RIA Novosti news agency quoted lawyer Anatoly Kucherena as saying that Snowden submitted the asylum request to Russia's Federal Migration Service. The service had no immediate comment. Scroll down for video . Seeking temporary asylum: Former NSA employee Edward Snowden, pictured centre during a press conference he gave in Sheremetyevo airport, Moscow, on Friday, has applied for temporary asylum in Russia . Stop off: Edward Snowden, pictured on Friday, said he would only stay in Russia until he can safely reach one of the Latin American countries ready to give him political asylum . The lawyer said Snowden made the move to request temporary asylum after a meeting at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. 'He reached the conclusion that he needs to write an application for . temporary asylum (in Russia), and this procedure has just been done,' Anatoly Kucherena, a lawyer who met Snowden on Friday along with human . rights activists. 'For now he is not going to go anywhere. For now he plans to stay in . Russia,' he said, adding that if Snowden were granted temporary asylum, . he should have the same rights as other citizens and be free to work and . travel in Russia. The asylum application could end his . time in limbo but risks deepening tension between the United States and . Russia, which has refused to expel him to his homeland for prosecution. The head of Russia's Federal Migration Service (FMS) confirmed the . agency had received Snowden's application. Anti-secrecy group Wikileaks, . which has been helping Snowden, said on Twitter that he had applied for 'a temporary protection visa'. Snowden, 30, is trapped in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, an area between the runway and passport control which Russia regards as neutral territory. Decision: Officials have said the decision will be made by Russia's Federal Migration Service - not by President Vladimir Putin, pictured yesterday during his visit to the island of Gogland 110 miles west of St Petersburg . Relations: Russian President Putin has invited President Barack Obama, pictured, to a summit in Moscow in September and said he does not want Snowden to harm already strained relations with Washington . He said on Friday he would seek refuge in Russia only until he can travel to one of the three Latin American countries ready to give him political asylum - Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua. He said the United States and its allies were preventing him from reaching those countries. Washington has revoked Snowden's passport and urged other nations not to help him reach an asylum destination. Kucherena said he expected a decision on Snowden's asylum request 'soon', though the Federal Migration Service has up to three months to decide on the application. The process for seeking temporary asylum is different from that for political asylum, which Kucherena said would require a decree from President Vladimir Putin. 'If we are talking about temporary asylum, then this is an issue not for the president but for the Federal Migration Service,' Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. Stranded: Mr Snowden arrived at Sheremetyevo airport on June 23 and has remained in the transit lounge ever since . Source: Lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, pictured outside Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow, has revealed Snowden applied for temporary asylum . Putin has rejected repeated U.S. calls . to send Snowden to the United States, but has said he does not want the . fugitive to harm already strained relations with Washington. Mr Putin yesterday described Snowden's arrival as an unwelcome present foisted on Russia by the United States. He said Snowden flew to Moscow intending only to travel on to another country, but the U.S. intimidated other countries into refusing to accept him, effectively blocking the fugitive from flying further. Snowden previously sought Russian asylum, which Mr Putin said would be granted only if he agreed not to leak more information. Snowden then withdrew the bid, the Kremlin said. During Friday's meeting in Sheremetyevo's transit zone, Snowden argued that he had not hurt U.S. interests in the past and has no intention of doing that. Mr Putin did not say if that would be sufficient grounds for asylum, adding that Snowden apparently did not want to stay in Russia permanently. Wanted: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, an analyst with a U.S. defence contractor, is wanted in the United States on espionage charges . Snowden is useful as a propaganda tool for Putin, who accuses the U.S. government of preaching to the world about rights and freedoms it does not uphold at home. But Putin has invited President Barack Obama for a summit in Moscow in September and both countries have signalled they want to improve ties. Putin has said twice that Snowden must stop all activities 'aimed at harming our American partners' if he wants political asylum in Russia, but he has not made clear whether the condition applies to temporary asylum as well. Temporary asylum is granted by the FMS, but Putin would be expected to make the final decision himself, even though he has tried to distance himself from Snowden's predicament. Putin said on Monday he hoped Snowden would leave as soon as he could, but left the door open for granting him asylum, saying there were signs the American fugitive was moving towards meeting the conditions he has set. Temporary asylum can be granted for up to a year, with the possibility of extension.

The murder of Princess Michael's Russian 'toyboy' could have been a case of mistaken identity, according to the politician who believes he was the intended victim. A senior official and neighbour, who drives an identical Mercedes car and was previously targeted by an assassination squad, has been told by police they are probing whether the killers got the wrong man. Furniture tycoon Mikhail Kravchenko, 46, who accompanied the princess on a four-day break in Venice in 2006, was buried last week after he was gunned down just 50 yards from his home in an elite village near Moscow. Wrong man? Mikhail Kravchenko, pictured in a gondola on a four-day break in Venice with Princess Michael of Kent in 2006, may have been gunned down mistakenly by killers looking for one of his neighbours . His neighbour, Vakha Evloev, 51, is the Moscow representative for Ingushetia, a volatile republic in the Caucasus region of southern Russia with a significant terrorist problem. He said: 'There is a suspicion that I was the true target, not Kravchenko, and they just mixed us up. We both drove dark blue Mercedes cars of the same model.' But it also emerged today that Kravchenko knew for years that someone had wanted him dead after surviving two bungled murder attempts as well as four arson attacks at his Moscow factory. It is understood Kravchenko - who despite his fears had no bodyguards - was killed close to Evloev's high-security home near the historic village of Peredelkino, where writer Boris Pasternak penned Dr Zhivago. 'I live not far from here and have CCTV cameras on my cottage, maybe they captured the killers,' he said. 'I have picked up the videotapes and passed them to police.' Mix-up? Vakha Evloev (left), a senior official and neighbour of Kravchenko (right) says police are looking at whether he was the intended target. Both men drove identical Mercedes cars and, while they don't look similar, the gunman did strike along a dimly lit lane at night . Evloev is now understood to be under increased security. A cousin of the ex-president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, Evloev was severely wounded in May 2008 when his car was shelled by automatic firearms in Nazran, the regional capital. While the men do not look similar, the shooting - using handmade weapons - was at around 2am in a dimly lit lane. Police say that Kravchenko, who built his business empire around his £130million-a-year March 8 furniture brand, was shot up to ten times before being hauled from his car and finished off with a bullet to the head. Kravchenko's circle claimed initially he had no enemies and was not concerned over his safety. Regal company: Kravchenko with Prince and Princess Michael of Kent in Moscow in 2006. According to a friend, the Russian tycoon feared he was a marked man after surviving two bungled murder attempts . But a close friend has now said that he knew he was a marked man. 'He knew he was in danger. We discussed it many times, but he didn't want to live in a security bubble, the source told the Sunday Times. 'He was reluctant to discuss security but, especially recently, he felt more at risk.' After his funeral in Moscow last week, attended by several thousand mourners led by his elderly parents, friends also alleged he was under pressure from sinister forces seeking to grab his business assets. He had been subjected to police raids in a move seen as pressurising him into giving up his assets. The retail furniture business is seen as a notoriously shady sector in Russia and friends said he had battled various attempts to seize his company. 'Toyboy': Kravchenko was at the centre of a royal scandal in 2006 after being photographed hand-in-hand with the married princess in Venice, raising questions about the state of her marriage to Prince Michael . Kravchenko himself had complained of his sofa designs being pirated, yet he seemed unconcerned over any threats. 'Mikhail had problems with the law-enforcement organs,' insisted retail consultant Dmitry Potapenko, a close friend. 'People were after his assets. The murder was not an accident. These people knew what they were doing. He was the head of the holding, he was the key figure, uniting the companies.' He claimed collusion between the police and shadowy business figures led to Kravchenko's murder. Yet a close friend, famous TV presenter Nikolai Drozdov, with him shortly before he died, said Kravchenko was not concerned about his personal safety in his final hours. 'He did not have a bodyguard, he drove himself everywhere in an old Mercedes,' he said. Another close business ally said: 'This version of mistaken identity is certainly possible.'

A Scottish couple accused of causing the death of their toddler son after traces of methadone and an anti-depressant were found in his body have gone on trial in Tenerife. Corinna Reid, 35, and her ex-partner Robert Cormack, 40, face up to 14 years in jail if convicted of 16-month-old Aiden's homicide. Aiden's January 2007 death at the Paraiso Floral Hotel in the popular resort of Adeje on the Canary Island was originally blamed on bronchitis. Tragic: 16-month-old Aiden's death in the popular resort of Adeje on the Canary Island was originally blamed on bronchitis . But Spanish detectives asked their Scottish counterparts to arrest his parents at their home in Edinburgh in January 2009 after toxicology tests showed traces of heroin substitute methadone and an anti-depressant in his body. Mr Cormack did not oppose extradition and was sent back to Spain where he was remanded in custody. Ms Reid fought extradition but was eventually sent back to Tenerife despite telling Edinburgh Sheriff's Court Aiden's dad had allegedly confessed to leaving drugs around their hotel room within reach of Aiden. She was freed on bail ahead of the start of the trial but told she must stay on the island. Leaked documents revealed that ex-heroin addict Mr Cormack had allegedly told Spanish judges his son had ingested the drugs accidentally mixed up in a glass of orange juice. He has since split from Aiden's mum. Ms Reid's lawyer had apparently hoped to agree an out of court settlement at the eleventh hour. Ms Reid's Madrid-based lawyer Christian Mesia claimed that the high profile case of missing Madeleine McCann led prosecutors to charge Ms Reid with homicide in connection with the death of her son Aiden . But the trial, scheduled to finish today in front of a jury after three days of evidence, began on Monday without any agreement having been reached. Speaking this morning outside court, Ms Reid's Madrid-based lawyer Christian Mesia, said: 'Neither Robert or Corinna should be on trial for homicide. 'Aiden's death was the result of Robert's negligence. It wasn't intended and was a tragic accident. 'They're being tried on a homicide charge because of the stubbornness of the court and the state prosecutor. 'Missing Madeleine McCann was being flashed up on the television every day the year Aiden died. 'I'm sure that's played a part in why Corinna is in front of a jury in court this week charged with homicide.' Speaking last month, Ms Reid protested her innocence. She said: 'I am not guilty. I thought my son had died of natural causes until Robert told me about the glass of juice after the results of the lab tests were known. It was a complete shock. 'This is all a nightmare. How can they want me to go to prison for 14 years for something I knew absolutely nothing about?' Lawyer Mr Mesia has claimed in the past: 'The father claims he opened the boy's mouth and saw that there was no trace of any of the liquid in his mouth. 'But instead of calling a doctor or rushing the infant to hospital he just washed and changed the lad, cleaned up the mess and said nothing about the incident. 'The first Corinna heard about this was seven months later when after the results of the lab tests came through. 'There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of any negligence or irresponsible behaviour on Corinna's part.' The case continues.","Corrina Reid and Robert Cormack are on trial in Tenerife .

When people go on the customary estate agent's tour of a flat before deciding whether or not to rent it, they often prepare themselves for the unexpected. But little could prepare one Australian couple for what they walked in on when they viewed a one-bedroom flat in Perth. Lying in bed was the body of a 35-year-old Brazilian man who police believe had been there for  days. Rebecca Hayward and her boyfriend were shocked to find a dead body when they viewed a rental property in Perth, Australia (pictured) The female real estate agent, who was . showing the prospective tenants through the flat, stared in horror and . burst into tears when the couple who found the body told her what was . lying in the bedroom. Not surprisingly, the inspection was cancelled - and now a row has broken out over why the real estate agency had not looked through the apartment before opening it up for viewing by prospective renters. Rebecca Hayward, 18, who was with her boyfriend at the time, said that when she entered the one-bedroom flat there was an 'overpowering smell like dead cats'. She told how she and her boyfriend were being shown through the living room by the agent when another couple discovered the dead tenant in the bedroom. 'The boyfriend of the other couple was walking into the bedroom when he turned, grabbed his girlfriend on the shoulders and turned her away,' Miss Hayward told the paper . 'He came out and said there was something dead in there and I asked if it was a cat. But he said, no, it was a person, a human, a body. 'The real estate agent gave us all a funny look, but then when she saw the body she turned around and there were tears in her eyes. 'She said 'Everybody out!' and then went to the balcony and shouted to the other agent waiting outside.' Miss Hayward said the woman called to her colleague: 'The viewing has been cancelled - don't let anybody else up here.' Police said they believed the tenant, a Brazilian man, had been dead for a few days, but there were no suspicious circumstances. Miss Hayward said she was glad she had not seen the body, but she and her boyfriend were struggling to cope with the trauma. Ms Hayward has criticised the agency over their failure to check the flat prior to the viewing.

Although she 'felt bad' for the real estate agent she believed the flat should have been inspected before it was opened for general viewing. Mr Graeme Baxter, managing director for the ACTON Hills agency, said the priority was for the welfare of the dead man's family. But he believed all proper procedures had been followed under the regulations. 'This incident has been a very traumatic process for all concerned,' said Mr Baxter. Mr Baxter was supported by the Real Estate Institute of WA, whose president David Airey, said it appeared the agent had done nothing wrong. 'The relevant Act requires that agents give 'reasonable notice' if showing a buyer or prospective tenant through a leased property. 'In this case notice was given,' Mr Airey told the paper. 'Under the circumstances it's understandable that the agent turned up with clients when she did. 'She wasn't to know that the existing tenant had unfortunately died in the previous few days' Now other agents have been told that their staff should check properties first before taking prospective buyers or tenants inside.","Police believe the man had been dead for days in the one-bed Perth flat .

The Oscar Wilde had been delayed from its arrival at Cherbourg, France, from Ireland by more than 24 hours after rough seas prevented a safe dock despite five attempts. And just when the estimated 500 passengers thought their ordeal was over, the Irish Ferries ship doors failed to open. They were forced to wait a further four hours for engineers to fix the problem. Stranded: The Oscar Wilde rwas left trapped in the English Channel after five failed attempts to dock at Cherbourg (file photo) Most of the 500 passengers were French schoolchildren returning to Cherbourg (pictured) from a trip to Ireland . At least 100 vehicles, including several trucks, were involved in the pile-up on the autobahn in Germany . Investigators had to cut some people free from the wreckage following the huge collision . A spokesman said the scene resembles 'a battlefield' with wreckage strewn all over the motorway . The journey from Ireland to France was meant to be overnight but ended up taking two days. Treacherous conditions in the English Channel prevented the Oscar Wilde - the company’s luxury flagship - from docking at the French port as scheduled on Monday at 2pm. But when it finally berthed after five attempts yesterday - 24 hours later than expected - the seafarers anxious to disembark were forced to remain onboard a further four hours when the boat’s bow doors jammed. Irish Ferries blamed 'a hydraulic failure' for preventing them from letting passengers - including 245 French pupils returning from a school trip to Ireland - back onto dry land. Normally in such circumstances a ship would sail back out of its berth and reverse in again so passengers could alight through the stern, or rear, door. But because conditions in the English . Channel remained dangerous, harbour authorities warned the ship's captain . against moving the ferry. A total of 245 French school pupils were among those onboard.

Spokesman Hagen Vetter said Autobahn 45 in Germany looked 'like a battlefield' following the horrific crash yesterday afternoon. The . motorway was completely shut down in both directions while rescue . services tried to pick through the wreckage to reach those inside, some . of whom had to be cut out. Heavy drifting snow had already led to several accidents in the area before the collision. Traffic jams reached a record 1,000 miles in Belgium during the morning rush hour . Commuters choose to go by bicycle in Antwerp, Belgium, rather than get caught in traffic . Office buildings in the French capital - like those in the European Union's capital, Brussels - were only partly full and high-speed trains are stuck in their stations. The . French train network SNCF urged commuters in the Paris region to stay . home instead of trying to reach downtown 'because of the unfavorable . evolution of weather conditions.' Paris airport screens flashed with red . warnings after the French civil aviation authority ordered 25 per cent of . flights out of Charles de Gaulle Airport canceled, and 20 per cent of . flights out of Orly Airport. Instead of the onset of spring, Belgium had a record 1,000 miles of traffic jams during morning rush hour as snowdrifts turned roads slippery and reduced vision. A strong wind made conditions even tougher. Thousands of commuters were left stranded on snowed-in platforms after many trains from Belgium were canceled, including some of the Thalys high-speed trains to France, Germany and the Netherlands. Roads around northern France were blocked by snow or closed by transport authorities, and trucks were banned from several routes. Nearly 500 cars were blocked near Cherbourg where snowdrifts piled up almost two feet and winds reached more than 60 mph.","Around 500 people were travelling on the Oscar Wilde from Ireland to France .

A young cancer patient whose plight touched the hearts of the nation is well on the way to completing her final wishes, which included meeting her idol Gary Barlow. Stephanie Knight, 21,  has been bravely battling bone cancer since . she was 17-years-old but learned on New Year's Day this year that her . condition is now terminal. So she drew up a list of things she would like to do both for herself and her family in the months before she dies. They varied from having a fake hen night and visiting the seaside with her nearest and dearest. Crossed off the list: Stephanie with Gary Barlow who dropped in for a cup of tea and a sing song . Her story inspired MailOnline readers and hundreds got in touch to offer their support and offer what help they could. Now, just one month on, the nursery nurse from Hertfordshire has achieved more than she ever  thought was possible. 'It has been really overwhelming,' she told MailOnline. 'Sometimes I'm afraid to smile because I know I will just cry with happiness!' A fortnight ago she had the rather surreal experience of having Gary Barlow singing in her living room in Braughing, Hertfordshire. The pop star had dropped in for a cup of tea and an impromptu sing song after hearing about Stephanie's story from his friend Amanda Holden. Steph's sister, Rachael Cross, 31, told MailOnline: 'It was amazing. Gary was so normal and . down to earth. He asked Steph what she had been up to and gave her baby nephew a cuddle. 'We . told him that he needed to sing otherwise we wouldn't let him leave! He . agreed but only after we said we'd sing the chorus of Back to Good with . him. 'He had a cuppa and stayed for just under an hour. Steph was so happy, . especially as she knew both her big sisters were such massive Take That . fans!' His kind-hearted bandmate Robbie Williams is currently in Los Angeles, but he sent a special note and photo to Steph after he was contacted by Sarah, Duchess of York. Rite of passage: Steph with two of the 'Dreamboys' who made cocktails at her fake hen do . Steph with the magician Dynamo (l) who showed her some card tricks, and a message from Robbie Williams . The Duchess also sent a big basket of goodies for Steph's 'fake' hen night at the local pub, as well as a framed photo of a sunset she had taken in Greece. Her office is helping Steph's family to set up their own charity. 'She's been so good to me,' Steph said. 'We're hoping to meet up soon and I owe her some big thank yous.' One of Steph's favourite days was enjoying a 'typical drunken night out' at the Ice Bar in London. They were treated like VIPs by the manager with free cocktails and a photographer on hand. 'It was a really great experience. I felt well that day, which was unusual as I often have to escape to have a rest,' Steph said. Another experience she enjoyed was meeting the Tottenham Hotspur football team - because she loves being able to treat her family. 'My brother Lloyd has been a Tottenham fan since he was little. He's 25 but he turned into a hormonal teenager when he met them!' she said. 'I loved watching his reactions. We got to see the team training and then speak to them afterwards. 'AVB (the manager Andre Villas Boas) gave Lloyd his jacket and whistle, which was a huge deal.' Footballer Jermain Defoe said: 'It was great for us . to meet Stephanie. She is an inspirational person and, when we saw that . meeting us was on her wish list, we were determined to make that happen.' Support from Tottenham: Steph pictured with (from right to left) Jermain Defoe and Scott Parker, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Tom Huddlestone, William Gallas, Michael Dawson and Kyle Naughton . Messages of support from Sarah, Duchess of York, who is hoping to meet Steph soon . Steph on her 18th birthday with her brother Lloyd (left) and in remission in 2011 at her niece's christening . Stephanie has remained positive despite having trouble breathing and having to rely on a wheelchair after having a leg amputated due to the cancer. She is on a medication drip and is in nearly constant pain. 'It is difficult, for instance trying to get around the shops and having people who won't move for you,' Steph admitted. 'But now so many people have been coming up to me and saying they've read about my story and how inspirational I am.' Her mother Cindy, 58, told MailOnline: 'Steph has been overwhelmed with the attention. Some days she will cry when she receives a kind message. She says: ""I'm just the luckiest girl in the world."" And I say to her: ""but Steph, you have cancer and you're going to die."" And she replies: ""yes, but look at my life right now."" 'She has always wanted very little and likes to help others. She has been emailing a girl in Northern Ireland, who sent her a thoughtful gift despite going through a tough time herself.  This girl says Steph has taught her so much.' Steph has also ticked off other wishes including meeting the magician Dynamo who amazed her with his card tricks and completing her childcare qualifications. Favourite day out: Steph, pictured with her parents, loved visiting the IceBar in London for a 'drunken night out' It's magic: Dynamo showed off a number of card tricks and managed to guess which card Steph was thinking of . Mrs Knight said: 'Steph has been teaching as a nursery nurse nearby. It's what she's wanted to do from the age of 11. 'She does one-to-ones helping them . with their reading and writing. She is often given the more challenging . ones as she has a way with her that they really respond to. Spending time in the school makes her feel normal.' Another rite of passage Steph has now . experienced was her own fake hen night, replete with 44 female friends . and family and some topless waiters. Mrs Knight said: 'It went really well and everyone was saying the next day that it was the best . one they had ever been to. 'The . Dreamboys were fabulous, they sent two lovely guys who looked after us . all night long and served us cocktails and did a show. We had special . T-shirts printed and played lots of silly games.' Steph wrote on Facebook: 'I would like to thank Deb and all her staff that put . on a great night and for everyone that came to my no hen hen do i had a . fantastic time and without crying i love you all so much and i don't . know what i'd do without you x x x.' Steph receives a manicure from former TOWIE star Amy Childs . Steph and two friends with a basket of hen do goodies . Steph is currently receiving chemotherapy at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. She and her family will be given a timeline of how her condition will progress in April but for now they have been told to do things from the list as soon as possible. So on Saturday Steph is going to London to see the musical Wicked and is meeting Ben Freeman, who plays the lead Fiyero, for afternoon tea. Next . week she, her mother and friend Lily, are going to Lifehouse Spa Hotel in Essex. They are also planning a trip to Westfield with a personal shopper and a family holiday to Chichester thanks to an anonymous gift from a premiership footballer. Mrs Knight said: 'It's important for us that no matter how long Steph has left she fills each day with things that make her happy. 'But I am a parent and when I go to bed I do think about how one day our life will be so different without her. 'I'm so very proud of her. She is remarkable in every way.' Steph met Gary Barlow and received a special message from Robbie Williams . Steph is now setting up a charity, called Steph's Wishes, after receiving so many donations via her website. It will help 18 to 24-year-olds who have cancer, especially those who have relapsed. 'The first time you have cancer who go in so positive,' Steph said. 'But the second time you know what's coming and you start to question whether the treatment will work as it didn't the first time. 'I want the charity to fund bucket list wishes whether it's a day out or to meet someone special.' The wishes yet to be fulfilled on her . list include meeting the Manchester United football team with her father Steve . and Prince William and Kate Middleton. Steph is now planning a special day out for her parents for their 22nd wedding anniversary and is putting together photobooks for her family. And despite all the hardships she has been through she says she wouldn't have changed anything. 'I'm a better person because of this and we're closer as a family,' she said. 'We shrug off the small things now as they don't matter. We take lots of pictures and laugh. 'If I could give one bit of advice I would say don't take life so seriously. Just try and enjoy every minute of it.'

Two thirds of nurses think patients in their own hospitals are at risk of neglect, a report reveals today. Bosses put financial targets ahead of patient care, according to three quarters of nurses, while a third say staffing is dangerously low. The findings of a poll of 8,000 nurses by the Royal College of Nursing comes just two months after a report into one of the country’s worst hospital scandals warned a similar tragedy could happen again. Neglect: A third of nurses claim that staffing levels are dangerously low . An inquiry into Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, where up to 1,200 died from neglect between 2005 and 2009, described how patients were subject to ‘inhumane’ treatment because bosses prioritised targets ahead of care. And last month another NHS survey found that nearly 40 per cent of doctors and nurses would not want family members treated in their own hospital. The RCN says poor care is often caused by understaffing, and it is particularly concerned about shortages on elderly wards where many patients have dementia and need help with basic tasks such as eating and washing. In a separate poll, the RCN found that a third of 2,086 ward sisters and senior community nurses felt staffing levels were unsafe at least once a week. Three quarters said they were potentially dangerous at least once a month while one in ten said they were rarely ever safe. Jeremy Hunt’s plans for nurses to work for a year as healthcare assistants before their degrees are ‘stupid’ and risk setting the profession back a century, it was claimed yesterday. The Health Secretary wants to make it compulsory for student nurses to spend time carrying out basic tasks such as washing and feeding patients to prove they are capable of caring before going to university. But Andrea Spyropoulos, president of the Royal College of Nursing, said the policy was a ‘waste of money’. She added: ‘It demonstrates the lack of understanding the Government has regarding the requirements of modern nursing. It is a waste of taxpayers’ money that will have no benefit to patients. It’s a really stupid idea.’ Critics also say the proposals lack crucial details, such as how the NHS could 21,000 extra student nurses each year, and who would assess them. General secretary Peter Carter urged the Government to introduce compulsory staffing levels to prevent needless patient deaths. He added: ‘Understaffing is the single biggest challenge facing the NHS today. ‘The introduction of mandatory safe staffing levels, enshrined in law, is now a matter of extreme urgency.  Mandatory staffing levels are proven to reduce patient mortality. The concerns of ward sisters are very clear, they do not have enough staff to always provide the high level of care they know all patients deserve.’ In February, a report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal warned that the failings could be repeated elsewhere. Relatives of loved-ones who died saw confused patients wandering the wards in search of help or having to drink from vases because they were so thirsty. Time pressure: NHS nurses spend 2.5million hours a week on needless paperwork . But at the time the trust was desperately short-staffed and managers had axed more than 50 nurses to meet financial targets. MPs and unions fear similar problems of neglect will arise as the NHS sheds thousands of nurses to save money. According to the latest official figures, the NHS lost 2,409 nurses last year, down from 372,277 to 369,868. But the number of unqualified healthcare assistants rose by 2,691 over the same period. Some experts worry that hospitals are replacing better paid senior nurses with inexperienced staff on similar wages to cleaners. Other figures compiled by the RCN show NHS nurses spend 2.5million hours a week on needless paperwork. More than half of the 6,387 who took part in the poll said the amount pointless admin had soared.","Three quarters of nurses say bosses put financial targets ahead of care .

Mr Allen has set up a trust fund for her . A four-year-old girl who lost her mother to cancer, will soon lose her father to the condition as well. Roxanne Allen's mother Chloe was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2009 and died last November. Her father Mike was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer in June 2011 and doesn't know how long he has left to live. However, he is determined to make his last months with his daughter special. He has also set up a trust fund in Roxanne's name to provide for her future. The 49-year-old baker from . Bridgehall, Stockport, said: 'I live day-by-day and enjoy every minute I . can. I am making plans so that Roxanne is okay and has a stable future. 'Chloe and I have the same attitude, to get on with life and enjoy it. We have never hidden anything from Roxanne. 'She . has seen me and her mum at our worst and was at Chloe's bedside when . she passed away. She hasn't asked me about my death yet, but she knows I . am not well.' The couple married in January 2009, just seven months before Chloe was given the bombshell diagnosis of breast cancer. She was given the all-clear after a . mastectomy but then Mike was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma, or . blood cancer, in June 2011. The family went on holiday to Disneyland Paris last June for Roxanne's birthday, as they didn't think Mr Allen had long left. Tragic family: Mike with his daughter Roxanne, son Dean from a previous relationship and his wife Chloe who died in November . He said: 'I was in a wheelchair for the trip and Chloe was pushing me around - that's how well she was.' But a few months later, they found Chloe's cancer had returned - and had spread 'everywhere in her body.' The . last time Mike saw his wife alive he had left her to get his final . treatment at The Christie on November 14. She passed away at home while . Mike was in hospital. Mike, . who also has a 16-year-old son called Dean, said: 'All the signs had . been that I would die first. It is shocking to think how quickly she . deteriorated. 'I helped Chloe plan her funeral and we both sat down and planned mine. She was a good organiser. 'It isn't about being brave but doing what I am supposed to do for a four-year-old who needs me. I just have to get on with it.' Chloe, pictured with her daughter Roxanne, died from breast cancer last November after battling the disease for three years . Mike Allen is determined to make his last months with his daughter Roxanne special . He said that his daughter has coped amazingly well with the trauma. 'She . looks out at night time and sees the brightest star and says ""there is . mummy"" and says good night to her, it keeps our spirits up,' he said. Mr Allen, whose condition is terminal, said he talks to a photo of his wife each night and tells her is will be 'joining her soon.' The widower has arranged for Roxanne to live with his wife's sister, Jane, 51, in Offerton. The family are in the process of setting up a fundraising account.

The hospital trust at the centre of one of the worst health scandals in living memory has been put into administration after losing £20million last year. Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust has been taken over by a team of managers who will spend the next 45 days deciding its fate. It is only the second time this has happened in the history of the NHS. South London Healthcare was put into administration last summer. Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust - where up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly after they were 'routinely neglected' - is to be put into administration, it was announced today . Mid Staffordshire, which runs . Stafford and Cannock hospitals, has a troubled past and up to 1,200 . patients are feared to have died needlessly due to poor care between . 2005 and 2009. In February, a long-awaited report . blamed the disaster on a ‘culture of fear’, with managers being more . obsessed with meeting targets than patient care. But the trust has long been plagued . by financial difficulties, largely caused by the fact that it does not . serve enough patients for its size. The decision to put the trust into administration has been made by the watchdog Monitor, which regulates foundation trusts . This means it cannot generate enough income from providing treatment and services to cover its running costs. In addition, it has struggled to . attract top doctors. As a result it has to use expensive agency staff to . plug gaps in the rota. On one occasion in 2011 it paid £5,700 for one . doctor to cover a 12-hour shift. Last night the watchdog Monitor announced that the trust had appointed administrators to take over its running. The new plan will be subject to a public consultation and services at the hospitals in Stafford and Cannock (pictured) will continue to run as normal until a final decision is reached . Dr Hugo Mascie-Taylor – one of the . country’s most senior doctors – and Alan Bloom, of accountancy firm . Ernst and Young, will spend the next 45 days deciding its fate. They are likely to conclude it should . be broken up and taken over by neighbouring trusts, such as University . Hospitals North Stafford, Burton and Wolverhampton. The watchdog insisted that all patient services would continue to be run as normal until its fate had been decided. David Bennett, chief executive of . Monitor, said: ‘It is important that people in Mid Staffordshire know . that they can still access services as usual at Stafford and Cannock . hospitals while the trust special administration process is ongoing.’","Includes Stafford Hospital, where 1,200 patients may have died needlessly .

She . won over the judges, even after tripping slightly during the evening . gown competition. Telecasters pointed it out but also noted her poised . recovery. She told the Today show on Thursday that with the heels and gown she was wearing it was inevitable she tripped and was lucky not to 'fall flat on her face'.

The 13-year-old girl needed hospital treatment after she was bitten on the arm and leg by the German Shepherd. The dog, which had escaped from a kennel whilst off-duty, also attacked two men who had rushed to the girl's aid. Attack: A Police dog, similar to this German Shepherd, attacked a 13-year-old girl after it escaped from a kennel at its handler's home (file picture) Taylor Smith, 18, was bitten on his arm, while 47-year-old cafe owner Alastair Driver suffered scratches and had his shirt ripped as he tried to fight off the dog. Another man had been attacked half an hour earlier after the dog broke free from an officer's home in Glossop, Derbyshire . Mr Smith, 18, said that he was at home when he heard the girl screams as she was being mauled by the police dog. He said: 'It had its jaw locked on her forearm. A man from a nearby cafe came out and put a knife sharpener in its mouth so it would release her and he managed to get her into the cafe. 'The dog ran off but then it came back and jumped up and locked on my arm.' He eventually managed to push the dog off and it was recaptured by its hander after a three hour search of the town.

Forward-thinking architects have come up with a new way to solve the UK's chronic housing shortage - converting garages into tiny homes. A row of out-of-use lock-ups on a council estate are due to be turned into cosy bedsits for young professionals and people unable to find a home. Tenants will have to pay just £11 a week for the mini houses, which are set to cost around £13,000 to convert. Community: An architecture firm plans to convert disused garages into a row of miniature homes . The designs were inspired by a row of garages which have been standing unused on the Lockner Estate in Dalston, East London. Architecture firm Levitt Bernstein has proposed to set up its 'pop-up' homes in spaces like the garages which are awaiting permanent redevelopment. Each home will measure 11.5 square metres, and contain a bed, kitchen and bathroom, with room for a small table and two chairs. Every fifth garage is set to be turned into a communal area, with a laundry, extra kitchen equipment and a dining space. Innovative: Levitt Bernstein hopes the unusual move will help alleviate the UK's housing crisis . Plans: These artist's impressions show how the 11.5 square metre homes will look . The homes will be built off-site and assembled by apprentices - and if the site is redeveloped, existing units can be dismantled and used elsewhere. The project is known as Pop-up HAWSE - standing for Homes through Apprenticeships With Skills for Employment. It was the winner of a housing design competition organised by the Building Trust, a charity which aims to encourage sustainable architecture in deprived areas. If it is successful, the scheme will be expanded to other parts of London and throughout the UK, concentrating on areas where there are lots of homeless people or a shortage of housing for the young. The architects are already in talks with a number of local authorities in hope of launching similar schemes. Blueprint: Detailed instructions show how the homes can be assembles without much difficulty . Georgie Revell, one of the architects who designed the project, said: 'The proposal targets under-used spaces in high density areas where land value is high and rising. 'We believe it offers a creative and practical interim solution between other development opportunities and we're really excited about the potential to develop the scheme with Building Trust and our partners.' 'The proposals not only offer a home but education opportunities in construction techniques,' said Jo McCafferty from Levitt Bernstein. 'It is a way of regenerating street frontage and a practical interim solution between other development possibilities.' Now: The garages are currently standing unused on the Lockner Estate in Dalston, East London . However, some experts have criticised the proposal for seeking to pack residents into the smallest spaces possible. Architect David Roberts said: 'Personally, I think ""pop-up"" housing is morally bankrupt. 'Any architect who is serious about homelessness should be addressing the causes of the problem, rather than using developer-speak consistent with the commercial forces making housing unaffordable for so many. 'There is political capital in presenting this as temporary solution to underused land, as much as to homelessness but the houses are pretty much caravans.'","Architect's plan for tiny flats on East London housing estate .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Created 4:31 PM on 29th June 2011 . It can be notoriously difficult to win over the in-laws. But Heidi Withers may have a tougher . task than most after her future mother-in-law emailed her a vicious . character assassination in which she attacked her for her ‘staggering . uncouthness and lack of grace’. Carolyn Bourne, a renowned grower of . pinks and dianthus flowers, told Miss Withers, 29, she should attend a . finishing school in ‘utmost haste’ to get rid of her ‘bad manners’. Etiquette guide: Renowned flower arranger Carolyn Bourne, right, gave her daughter-in-law to be a stern dressing down via e-mail. She is pictured here at a plant show in Coventry with her husband Edward . She went on to describe her as ‘an ideal candidate for the Ladette to Lady television series’. The email was intended to be a . private rant. But shocked Miss Withers, a PA for a London recruitment . firm, sent it on to a select group of friends. Surprised and amused, the . friends in turn forwarded the message on to their friends. And by last night the email had been . posted on numerous websites, with thousands writing comments about the . ‘mother-in-law from hell’. Mrs Bourne, the stepmother of Miss . Withers’ fiancé Freddie Bourne, sent the email after the young couple . had spent a weekend at her £500,000 five-bedroom detached home on the . picturesque outskirts of Dawlish, Devon. Incensed by her future . daughter-in-law’s behaviour, the 60-year-old wrote: ‘It is high time . someone explained to you about good manners. Yours are obvious by their . absence and I feel sorry for you.’ 'Uncouth': Heidi Withers, left, on holiday here in the U.S. with her husband-to-be Freddie, forwarded the email sent to her by Carolyn Bourne . Mrs Bourne, who is married to . Freddie’s 63-year-old father Edward, even said Miss Withers’ behaviour . had left their pet dog Bomber ‘profoundly upset, depressed and anxious’. Mrs Bourne, who runs Whetman Pinks, a . sprawling plant nursery based around 30 industrial greenhouses in the . grounds of her home, went on to list several examples of Miss Withers’ apparent lack of manners. She accused her of poor table . manners, insulting the family in public and failing to send a . hand-written card to say thank you after her stay. And she rounded off the email with a withering attack on the nature of the couple’s relationship. ‘One could be accused of thinking . that Heidi Withers must be patting herself on the back for having caught . a most eligible young man,’ she concluded. ‘I pity Freddie.’ 'Perfect candidate': Mrs Bourne compared her future daughter-in-law to the television programme Ladette to Lady . Mrs Bourne also criticised Miss Withers’ parents for failing to save enough money for their daughter’s wedding. Miss Withers’ mother Sylvia, a nurse, and father Alan live with their two Yorkshire terriers in a five-bedroom £450,000 detached cottage set in half an acre in the village of Aylton, near Ledbury in Herefordshire. A neighbour said: ‘They are such a lovely family and Heidi is a brilliant girl. They really are the salt of the earth. ‘I don’t know why the lad’s stepmother is getting involved.’ Last night 29-year-old Freddie, who runs online bicycle shop Capital Cycles and lives in Putney, South-West London, declined to comment. Mrs Bourne also refused to answer any questions as she attended a Horticultural Trades Association plant show at Stoneleigh Park, Coventry. Mind your manners: Carolyn Bourne, a renowned grower of pinks and dianthus, sent Heidi Withers the vicious email after her future daughter-in-law visited Mrs Bourne's Devon home . Her husband Edward said: ‘We are aware of what is being said. I know it is very boring, very repetitive and very dull but we will not be making any comment and neither will my wife.’ Miss Withers and Mr Bourne are not the first to suffer acute embarrassment because of out-of-control email round robins. A derogatory email exchange between Harry Fildes, 25, and Sebastian Marsh, 24, about Mr Marsh’s ex-girlfriend spread rapidly in March after Mr Fildes accidentally sent a copy to the girl in question. Mr Marsh was later sacked by his company, Miller Insurance. And Holly Leam-Taylor, a graduate trainee at consultants Deloitte, quit in December 2009 after sending an email discussing attractive male staff. It is high time someone explained to you about good manners. Yours are obvious by their absence and I feel sorry for you. Unfortunately . for Freddie, he has fallen in love with you and Freddie being Freddie, I . gather it is not easy to reason with him or yet encourage him to . consider how he might be able to help you. It may just be possible to . get through to you though. I do hope so. If . you want to be accepted by the wider Bourne family I suggest you take . some guidance from experts with utmost haste. There are plenty of . finishing schools around. Please, . for your own good, for Freddie’s sake and for your future involvement . with the Bourne family, do something as soon as possible. Here are a few examples of your lack of manners: . I . understand your parents are unable to contribute very much towards the . cost of your wedding. (There is nothing wrong with that except that . convention is such that one might presume they would have saved over the . years for their daughters’ marriages.) If . this is the case, it would be most ladylike and gracious to lower your . sights and have a modest wedding as befits both your incomes.","Carolyn Bourne told Heidi Withers she was 'an ideal candidate for Ladette to Lady television series'

Hope: Paul Gascoigne is 'out of danger' Paul Gascoigne is ‘out of danger’ after being taken to intensive care in the US last week, according to friends. It is understood the former England international suffered an adverse reaction to a detoxification course at a clinic, where he was being treated for alcohol addiction. Gascoigne, 45, was admitted to the Cottonwood clinic near Tuscon, Arizona, days after a video emerged of him sobbing and incoherent on stage in front of a room full of fans. Former Tottenham Hotspur team-mate Gary Mabbutt said Gascoigne was recovering and would soon be well enough to return to the clinic. He added: ‘The first thing he underwent at the clinic was a detox. 'Unfortunately, Paul had a very bad reaction to the detox and the clinic decided that as a precaution it was best to transfer him to hospital. ‘He’s recovering and hopefully soon he will be back into the clinic to continue his rehab.’ 'Over the years he has had a lot of support from the football family, but of course it could be a long road to recovery. Now Paul's asked for the help we can focus on getting through this.' Gary Lineker had said that his friend is . 'struggling'. The Match of the Day presenter wrote on Twitter last . night: 'Gazza is struggling, Let's hope he can hang on in there.' Unwell: Gascoigne in Bournemouth shortly before a group of friends paid for him to receive treatment for his alcoholism at a clinic in Tucson, Arizona . The star flew to the U.S. last week where he was due to be treated at a rehabilitation clinic in . Tucson, Arizona. Instead, he was taken to a nearby hospital where he has . spent the past four days. According . to sources, his condition has stabilised, although it is not clear when . he will be well enough to attend his rehab course. A . group of celebrity friends – including Chris Evans, Gary Lineker and . Piers Morgan – had paid for Gascoigne to attend the clinic, which costs . about £30,000 for an eight-week stay. Since . then a number of England players, among them Wayne Rooney, have stepped . forward with offers of funds. Comedian James Corden has also donated . money. Gascoigne . ‘willingly’ flew to the States for help days after a video emerged of . him sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans. Concern: Gary Lineker, who has helped fund Gascoigne's treatment in the US, last said that his former teammate was 'struggling' But when he landed in Arizona he was pictured drinking a pint at the airport bar, before a friend took it off him. The Cottonwood Clinic, which boasts a team of ‘highly trained clinicians’, has ‘been effective for him previously’, his management company said. Gascoigne has previously received help at . The Providence Projects rehabilitation centre in Dorset, whose . treatment director Paul Spanjar was instrumental  in sending him to the . US. Mr Spanjar called at the former footballer’s home last week after the video became public – and found him ‘in terrible shape’ at 9.30am. He said: ‘He was certainly under the influence. Physically he had really deteriorated.’ He added that Gascoigne had fallen off the wagon over the past six weeks, saying: ‘At times myself or a colleague would go round to check that he was still alive. It seemed as though he had a death wish.’ Gascoigne made 57 appearances for  his country. England manager Roy Hodgson said his captain, Steven Gerrard, has gone to the FA and ‘told them the players would like to contribute’. He added: ‘Many of them looked up to him as the star player of the day, and I can only back that up.’ In his Mail on Sunday Live magazine column today, Chris Evans writes: ‘When I saw the pictures of my old pal last week at a so-called personal appearance, even I was shocked. ‘I say even I, because I’ve seen him bad before; much worse than you might imagine. 'Paul has been on the edge for well over a decade now, although admittedly never closer than of late.’ Gifted: The former Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Newcastle United star is widely regarded as one of the most talented English footballers .","The 45-year-old footballer spent four days in hospital after arriving in US .

Visitors to a new science exhibition will hear the late Sky At Night host Sir Patrick Moore say how he wanted to get rid of the world’s leaders by sending them to a distant star. He recorded the message nine months before his death last December and describes his hopes for the world in 2113. Sir Patrick, who was 89 when he died, says: ‘It depends entirely... not on science but  on the politicians. ‘I must say that looking at the present world leaders inspires me with a feeling of no confidence at all. 'I’d like to take the whole lot of them on a spacecraft and send them on a one-way journey to Alpha Centauri.’ Alpha Centauri is a constellation of stars in the southern sky which would take at least 40 years to reach by rocket from Earth. His voice features in a room devoted to recordings of famous Britons at the exhibition to mark the 100th birthday the Medical Research Council at Imperial College in London’s Kensington. Other contributors to the Medical Research Council exhibition include outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King who hopes the world’s banking crises will become less severe and less frequent in future. He also predicts that in 100 years’ time money, as we know it, will not exist. ‘I think the form of money may well look very different,’ says King. ‘It may be entirely electronic.’ Scientist and TV presenter Lord Winston, Channel Four News host Jon Snow, trade union leader Bob Crow and ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ judge Bruno Tonioli, also give their opinions on the future. Mr Tonioli jokingly introduces himself: . ‘Hello I am Bruno Tonioli. I am part of the fabric of society now, . introductions are not necessary.’ The exhibition, called Strictly Science, runs from April 4-14 at Imperial College, South Kensington. Sir Patrick had said in previous interviews that he wanted the world’s leaders rocketed off into space. Ship'em off: The late Sky At Night host recorded a message before his death saying he . hoped to send world leaders, presumably British Prime Minister Cameron . and U.S. President Barack Obama, into space . Far enough: Sir Patrick Moore suggested Alpha Centauri as a suitable destination for world leaders - a star constellation which would take 40 years to reach . Despite his uncompromising views, Sir Patrick himself dabbled in politics. In the general election of 1979 he helped launch the United Country Party, complaining that the Conservatives were ‘too wet’. A staunch eurosceptic, he later joined UKIP and reserved his strongest criticism for Labour MPs. Musing in one edition of The Sky At Night on the probability of alien life in space, he said: ‘Somewhere in the universe there could be a complete carbon copy of Anthony Wedgwood Benn -- although I sincerely hope not.’ Launched in April 1957, the programme attracted millions of viewers and made a huge contribution to educating the British public about astronomy. Sir Patrick entered the record books as the longest-running host of the same television show ever.","Sir Patrick Moore wanted to send world leaders to space to get rid of them .

It has 300 days of sunshine a year, drips with glamour and has been a tax-free haven for 130 years. Which is why comedy legend John Cleese must have celebrated when, last year, he won permission to become one of Monaco’s 32,000 pampered citizens. Faced with crippling alimony bills, the move looked like a financial blessing for Cleese, 73, and his fourth wife Jennifer Wade, 42. But now the couple have surprised everyone by giving up their Monaco home and returning  – at some speed – to London. What’s more, the pair are conducting an online fire sale of the furniture and artworks left behind in the principality. Cleese might be glad of the additional funds as, financially, the timing of his about-turn couldn’t be worse. By leaving Monaco before the start of the new tax year, he is liable to pay an entire year’s tax to the Inland Revenue, the very thing he was said to be keen to avoid. So why the sudden change of heart? One friend told The Mail on Sunday: ‘John went to Monaco for tax reasons but the truth is he was very lonely. In London, he has a tight network of friends who love and support him. His French isn’t very good and he found it hard to plug into the culture.’ The plush apartment the couple shared in Monte Carlo’s exclusive Carré d’Or area has already been re-let, meaning Cleese and his wife must have the place clear by April 1. Which is presumably why they are now selling designer furniture and ‘select pieces’ from their art collection there. The items, listed on a hastily put-together advert which appeared on the Monaco Life website last week, are being sold at ‘deeply discounted prices’. They include a mahogany dining table and set of ice-blue velvet covered chairs for €3,000 (£2,632) by Hollywood designer Christopher Guy, as well as a garish pearl-white sofa, also by Guy, and a Le Corbusier-style, pony-skin chaise longue, both for €3,000. Last week, Cleese was seen on the . King’s Road near the luxurious home he bought for £1.45million in 2010. Publisher Random House have granted Cleese an extension on the memoirs . he is writing, now due out next year. After initially struggling, he is said to be finding it easier to write with friends around him. One major source of Cleese’s woes is wife number three, Alyce Faye Eichelberger. Following a 19-month court battle in America, he was told to pay £8million in cash and assets to Eichelberger, plus £612,000 a year for the next seven years, despite the couple having no children together. The ruling is thought to have reduced his fortune to around £10million. The former Monty Python star also had to sell the couple’s ocean-front California home, his beloved 14.6-acre ranch in Santa Barbara, an apartment in New York and a mews flat in London. The crippling divorce costs saw Cleese head out on the road last year with his stand-up comedy Alimony tour. Friends were hopeful that in marrying Ms Wade, in Mustique on August 2 last year, he had turned a corner, yet are concerned he’s now feeling the strain of his work load. A source said one reason for the couple’s return is that Jennifer, a keen swimmer, found the Monaco home’s communal pool too small. A spokesman for Mr Cleese said: ‘John and Jennifer are delighted to call London home once again and look forward to spending many happy years together in their favourite city.’","Cleese's move back to UK will make him liable to pay a year's tax .

Caught . in an international backlash, Greig and Christian were yesterday in . hiding, where they were said to be receiving medical assistance amid . growing fears for their ‘physical and emotional wellbeing’. While . it is not thought the presenters broke any laws, they are expected to . be interviewed by police. Scotland Yard is preparing a report for Mrs . Saldanha’s inquest and requires statements from them. Yesterday the dead nurse’s family were being comforted by relatives and friends at their terrace home in Southmead, Bristol. A friend who answered the door said Mr Barboza, Lisha and the couple’s 16-year-old son Junal were ‘very, very shocked and unhappy’. Mrs Saldanha, from Valencia in south-west India, married Mr Barboza, from the nearby village of Shirva, in 1993. They moved to Bristol nine years ago. When she was working in London she lived in nurse’s quarters behind the hospital, returning to the family home on her days off. Mr Barboza’s mother Carmine, 69, said the family returned to India to visit her every two years. She said neither her son nor daughter-in-law had told her about the hoax call. ‘Everything seemed normal,’ she said. ‘But then we got a call last night from Benedict informing us that Jacintha had died. He was crying and couldn’t speak much. ‘We don’t know whether we’ll be able to bring her body back to India but we desperately hope so.

Police officers who carried out a search for a missing toddler have expressed regret that they did not force open a car's trunk where the youngster was later found dead. The body of two-year-old Isaiah Theis, who disappeared on Tuesday night, was found in the trunk of a locked car parked outside the boy's home in Wisconsin at about 10:15 p.m on Wednesday. Searchers had looked into the car and checked the area around it several times. However, they did not look in the trunk. Concerns: Police officers who carried out a search for missing toddler Isaiah Theis have expressed regret that they did not force open a car's trunk where the youngster was later found dead . Speaking last night, Chief Deputy Steve Moe said  he wished they had. But he said the search teams were operating under the assumptions that Isaiah had wandered off Tuesday evening, which he had a tendency to do, and that all the cars were locked. He said deputies did not have access to the keys, but he wasn't certain whether the keys were on the property. 'Would we liked to have forced entry to the car? Yeah, from my personal perspective,' Moe said. Moe declined to speculate how Isaiah ended up in the trunk and wouldn't say whether investigators consider his death an accident or the result of foul play. 'I know that there's strong interest in what caused it and what things led to the boy getting in that car,' he said. 'It's just too early.' Search: Hundreds of volunteers looked for the young boy near his family's rural Wisconsin farm . He added: 'A full autopsy has been requested and it would be inappropriate for anyone to speculate as to the cause and nature of death until that examination has been done.' Isaiah's maternal grandfather, Paul Krey, told KARE-TV that the car belonged to a customer of his son-in-law, who is a mechanic and works out of a shop on his property. Krey said the car was parked there and waiting to be fixed. All the Theis children were comfortable hanging around the shop and spent plenty of time around the vehicles while their father worked, the grandfather said. The boy's mother told investigators Isaiah was last seen about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday while playing with his 7-year-old brother at their home near Centuria, which is about 60 miles northeast of St. Paul. Fears: The search was hindered by the forests and cornfields in Centuria . About 2,450 civilian volunteers helped search the fields and woods surrounding the family's home throughout the day Wednesday, the sheriff said. Debbra White, 51, of Milltown, left a teddy bear and a wind chime at a makeshift memorial near the scene. White told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that she lost her 8-year-old son more than 20 years ago when he drowned in the St. Croix River. 'There's nothing I can say to bring their son back,' White said. About 100 volunteers searched for the boy on Tuesday night and throughout the day on Wednesday before the volunteers were told to go home at around 10pm. Just minutes later an officer found the boy's body.","Isaiah Theis was found in the trunk of a locked car parked outside his home .

A benefits-claiming mother-of-11 who is moving into a taxpayer-funded mansion hired a private fairground ride worth hundreds of pounds for one of her children, it has been revealed. Jobless Heather Frost, who has never done a day's work in her life, is said to have bragged to friends on social media about the extravagant treat, which she bought in the summer of 2011. Miss Frost, 37, who is to be handed the keys to a so-called 'eco-home' later this year big enough to house her huge brood, managed to fund the party despite living on hand-outs.

Extravagant: Jobless Miss Frost hired a fairground carousel like this, worth hundreds of pounds (file picture) The man who supplied the ride, William Danter, told MailOnline he arrived at Frost's current home in Chruchdown, Gloucs, and immediately decided he would only accept cash for the two-hour hire because of how 'scruffy' it was. He said: 'We would usually accept cheques but because it was a roughish, scruffy house I said I wanted to be paid in cash. You can't be too careful.' Despite the dilapidated appearance of the house, Mr Danter, who has run Billy Danter's Fun Fair for several years, said Frost's children were well-behaved during the two-hour visit. 'They came and watched us set-up and were excited. They were all quite scruffy but they were nice kids and polite.' Dream home: Frost, 37, is having a six bedroom home built for her and her 11 children . But Mr Danter, a father-of-two whose wife suffers from multiple sclerosis, had short-shrift for Frost's lifestyle and said it was a slap in the face for hard-working families. He said: 'The (benefits) system is broken. It should be there as a safety net and to support people who need help, not for people to live on. You should have to work for your money, not work the system like this. 'You should only have the amount of kids that you are able to support - if I had more children I wouldn't be able to work as much.' It was revealed this week how Miss Frost's lavish lifestyle has also extended to treating her current partner, 57-year-old James Martin, to flying lessons, while she even owns a horse and a £1,000 parrot called Jake. Earlier this week her father waded into the row branding her 'lazy' and saying she needed to 'get off her backside' and get a job. Royston Frost, 72, is angry and ashamed of his . daughter and confessed he doesn’t even know the identity of . the fathers of two of his daughter’s 11 children. ‘I . didn’t tell my daughter to have 11 kids,’ he says. ‘I tried to stop her . at five, but you can’t tell someone in their 20s what to do. ‘Ever since she had her first child, she hasn’t been able to work because she’s had to look after all those kids. ‘She should have got off her backside and got a bloody job like the rest of us. She’s on all the benefits she can get. ‘Don’t get me wrong, she’s a good mum and her kids are always clean — she just has too many of them. ‘I . can’t stand what she’s become. She’s lazy.

How the hell can she afford to keep a . horse when some people struggle even to put food on the table?’ The council has knocked through two houses in Churchdown, Gloucs., to create a larger one for the family, who have lived there for five years . Heather with daughters Page, 11, Till, 3 and Daisy, 5. She said that the new house will be built to her exact specifications .

The . secluded four-bedroom stone property sits at the end of a winding . driveway and enjoys stunning views over the valley and former mining . village of Lydbrook. She had to move out when the house was sold by the Diocese of Gloucester for £307,000 in June 2008. But a resident in the village said: 'We were glad to see the back of her, but I can't believe the council are building her a mansion. 'It's a joke. The benefits system is broken in this country. 'Hard-working people are paying for lazy people like her to bring up children who will probably be lazy too.' Her new ‘eco-home’ is, to use estate agent speak, a stunning contemporary living space in a sought-after location. The house, which is still a few . months off completion, has six bedrooms, three bathrooms and a huge . living/dining area, ideal for entertaining.

It has been less than two months since the 89-year-old heir to Brooke Astor's fortune was wheeled out of court to begin his prison term, but Anthony Marshall might be on his way home. Marshall was sentenced to one-to-three years in prison for stealing millions from his mother's estate, but his legal team has formally applied for medical parole due to his ailing health. State correctional officials confirmed the appeal from Fishkill Correctional Facility in Elmira, New York, on Thursday and his court hearing will be held on August 19. Emotional: Anthony Marshall's wife Charlene, cried and hugged him, as the heir to Brooke Astor's estate was jailed last month . A source told the New York Post: . 'Anthony is dying, and he is in a lousy state prison. He has a new . doctor's letter stating he is even worse than a few months ago. 'He has very bad heart concerns. He is incontinent. It could be weeks or months or days.' When sentenced last month, Manhattan's Supreme Court Justice A Kirke Bartley said: 'I take no pleasure in following my duties', as he ordered Marshall to serve the minimum sentenced handed down to him in 2009. Bartely said he'd rather not jail the World War II vet, but prosecutors argue that his state of health and war record shouldn't mean he gets released early for grand larceny. Marshall's lawyer, William B. Zabel, said his client should be allowed to die in peace at his home with his wife Charlene by his side. When Marshall was wheeled out of court to begin his prison term last month, his wife wept and hugged him. He had previously lost a series of requests to avoid prison because of his failing health. Sentencing: Anthony Marshall arrivesd outside the court, in a wheelchair and slippers, with his wife Charlene in June 2013 . Distraught: Charlene Marshall seen leaving court in June after her 89-year-old husband was ordered to serve his sentence . Astor had been a fixture of New York society before her death at the age of 105, in 2007. Her charitable largesse was recognized in 1998 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's top civilian honor. Astor . inherited the money from her third husband, Vincent Astor, a . great-great-grandson of real estate and fur magnate John Jacob Astor, . who was one of the first multimillionaires in the U.S. When Marshall arrived in the courtroom in a wheelchair, his wife Charlene cried and caressed his shoulder. He declined to speak during the brief proceeding last month, looking downward but showing little reaction. In . earlier trials his wife, who one of Marshall's sons blames for the . family's troubles, had been accused by prosecutors as being the motive . for Marshall taking money from his mother. Elizabeth Loewy, a prosecutor, said Marshall defrauded his mother 'because of his 'preoccupation for getting money for Charlene', according to the New York Times. The . original trial was also told that Astor disliked her daughter-in-law . and one of her nurses referred to Mrs Marshall as 'Miss Piggy'. Her dislike for Mrs Marshall was allegedly shown in her will, when she left her two second-hand mink coats in a size 6, knowing she would never be able to wear them. Court date: Anthony Marshall arrived in court last month, helped by Charlene, as a Judge prepared to sentence him to prison . Sentencing: Anthony Marshall seen listening to his attorney as the 89-year-old waited to learn his fate at a New York court . At Marshall's sentencing, the judge . read parts of a letter from one of his twin sons, Alec, urging the court . to spare him prison. 'Please . consider all the good that my father has done for this country ... My . father once said, about the events that happened before the case, that, 'you . can't change the past', Justice Bartley quoted the letter as saying. He . urged Marshall to allow his son to get back in contact with him. Marshall's twin sons from an earlier marriage, Alec and Phillip, had testified against their father in the 2009 trial. And . it was Philip who brought the original guardianship case against his . father in 2006, charging him of misusing Astor's funds, according to Vanity Fair. The civil case was settled but a criminal case quickly followed. Prosecutors said Marshall, a decorated Second World War veteran and former U.S. ambassador, exploited his mother's failing mind to loot her millions. After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, Marshall bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money. High society, Anthony Marshall with his mother, Brooke Astor, at the Plaza Hotel in 2002 . He also took valuable artwork off her . walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most . of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite . charities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. Astor had devoted her life to . philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, . the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum. However, . the multimillionaire was left to spend her last days in allegedly . heart-breaking conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue . apartment while she napped in her own urine with no one to help. She died in her 64-acre Holly Hill . estate in New York, in August 2007. The estate, and her Park Avenue home . in Manhattan, were later sold. When the wranglings over her $100 million estate were settled in March last year, it was reported that Marshall was ordered to pick  $74,680 worth of her possessions. He chose a mixture of items, from a $30 wall bracket shaped like a tortoise to a $40,000 painting of a donkey by Giovanni Tiepolo, Vanity Fair said. In the settlement, the Metropolitan Museum agreed to a settlement of $3 million for the Childe Hassam painting Flags Fifth Avenue, 1917, which had been bequeathed to the museum but sold by Mashall for $10 million in 2002. The Astor family made their money in the fur trade in the 1700s. Marshall's step-grandfather, John Jacob Astor, was the wealthiest passenger to die on the Titantic, where he was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck. Art collection: Brooke Astor's staircase of her Holly Hill manor was adorned by paintings of dogs . Luxury: The Park Avenue home in Manhattan had 14 rooms and six terraces . Socialite: Brooke Astor loved to entertain in her Park Avenue home, when she wasn't attending gala dinners . Marshall's lawyers said she knowingly changed her will to benefit her only child, and that he had legal authority for the gifts he gave himself from her money. His lawyers and doctors said a prison term could kill Marshall, who has Parkinson's disease, depends on a wheelchair and cannot get out of bed, go to the bathroom, bathe, or dress himself without help. After losing a series of appeals, lawyers for Marshall and his co-defendant Francis Morrissey Jr -  a former estates lawyer convicted of forging Astor's signature on a change to her will - filed papers last week seeking a new trial and asking that both remain free. Justice Bartley rejected that request and sent Morrissey, 72, to prison. Morrissey was convicted of forging Astor's signature on a change to her will. His defense argued that if the signature was phony, he knew nothing of it. Morrissey's lawyers indicated that . they would continue an appeal that hinges on a sworn statement from . juror Judi DeMarco, who said she felt threatened when another juror made . hostile gestures, cursed at her and started toward her during . deliberations. Ms DeMarco said she felt . demoralized when she asked to get off the jury, but Justice Bartley . instead told the panel to keep deliberating civilly. 'I was tired and beaten and felt . totally alone' and finally 'acquiesced in guilty verdicts that I did not . in good conscience believe were legitimate,' Ms DeMarco, who is also an . attorney, said in the June 8 statement. Her claims were part of Marshall's and Morrissey's unsuccessful appeals. The . state court's Appellate Division concluded the jury tensions 'appeared . to resolve themselves, and there is no reason to believe that the . ultimate unanimous verdict, confirmed by polling [asking whether each . juror agreed with the verdict], was the result of coercion'. However, the defense lawyers argued that the new statement merited at least a hearing.

Labour has been accused of plotting a 'Bridget Jones tax' on singletons as its local authorities demand an end to council tax discounts for those living alone. In a formal submission to ministers, the Local Government Association is calling for the power to end the 25 per cent discount offered in recognition of the fact single people place fewer demands on local services. More than seven million are thought to benefit from the discount, at a cost of around £2.7billion a year. Singleton targeted for tax: Renee Zellwegger as Bridget Jones in the 2001 film Bridget Jones Diary . But if town halls get their way a single person living in a typical Band D property would see their council tax bill rise from £1,083 to £1,444 – an increase of £361 a year, or £30 a month. Councils are also demanding the removal of a rule that forces them to hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax. They said town halls should be free to raise council tax by as much as they like. The LGA is an umbrella group representing hundreds of councils of different political persuasions. But sources claim the campaign to end the discount is being driven by Labour authorities including Liverpool, Sheffield, Islington and Exeter. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'There is clearly a well-orchestrated campaign being pushed forward by Labour councillors to target the most vulnerable. 'This is a Bridget Jones tax and shows how out of touch Labour are.' Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, has criticised the LGA's proposal as a 'Bridget Jones' tax . In its submission, the LGA calls for councils to be given the 'full and unconstrained ability to vary locally all council tax discounts, including the single person's discount'. Councils argue the power is needed to help them deal with a 10 per cent cut in funding for discounts this year. Local authorities are also angry at legislation forcing them to hold a local referendum if they want to increase council tax by more than 2 per cent a year. The rule was introduced following a free-for-all during Labour's years in power when council tax bills doubled. No council has yet dared to stage a referendum, although a number raised council tax by 1.99 per cent this year. Ministers have provided funding for a council tax freeze for three years running, equivalent to a 9.7 per cent cut in real terms for bill payers. But more than 30 per cent of councils chose to increase their bills this year, arguing the Government could not guarantee long-term funding. The LGA said town halls should be given 'flexibility around income generation, including council tax'. A Government source said there is no prospect of the referendum rule being lifted.","Local Government Association calls for power to end 25% discount .

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today told MPs that managers who fail patients will be struck off and barred from working in the NHS again . Doctors and nurses could be given pay rises simply for treating their patients with compassion. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday promised a ‘radical overhaul’ of the NHS, putting a far greater emphasis on old-fashioned care in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal. He said one measure could be to introduce a system of pay rises which would see staff rewarded if they show ‘compassion, dignity and respect’ when treating patients. But patient groups said nurses should not have to be paid extra just for doing their jobs properly. Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s incredible when you think of the level that nursing care, and medical care in general, has sunk to. Compassion should be part of doctors’ and nurses’ jobs. ‘They are quite well paid as it is – they certainly should not be getting more. To talk about giving people more money for something they should be doing anyway is wrong.’ The pay plans were among a raft of measures announced by Mr Hunt yesterday in the hope of preventing another disaster on the scale of Mid Staffordshire, where as many as 1,200 patients died from ‘routine’ neglect. Last month a damning report by Robert Francis, QC, warned of a culture of fear in the Health Service that was obsessed with targets to the detriment of patients. It warned that unless major changes were made to the NHS, the neglect and horrific treatment at Mid Staffordshire would be repeated. In his formal response to the Francis report, Mr Hunt called the scandal ‘a betrayal of the worst kind’. He said NHS staff would now have a legal ‘duty of candour’ to tell the truth about patient care to patients, families and the Government. Hospitals could be fined if they fiddle figures on death rates or waiting times or hide mistakes from patients and families. A series of measures will be enforced in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Stafford Hospital . The Government is also considering . prosecuting individual doctors or nurses who cover up their mistakes. Hospitals will also face tougher inspections from the Care Quality . Commission which could last up to a month. They will be rated as ‘outstanding, good, requiring improvement or poor’, in a process similar to the Ofsted system in schools. And Mr Hunt said he would work closely . with hospitals and NHS Employers, the organisation which sets wages, to . ensure that pay rises given to staff were linked to ‘high quality . care’. Under the current system, thousands of . doctors and nurses are given salary increases of up to 8 per cent every . few years just for doing the same job. Hospital doctors earn an average . of £74,000 a year rising to £109,000 for consultants. Nurses are paid . around £30,500 a year. It is not yet clear how staff would be . monitored on the quality of their care but it could be through the new . Friends and Family test, given to patients after hospital treatment. Patients are asked if they would recommend the hospital to friends and . family. Mr Hunt said: ‘The events at Stafford Hospital were a betrayal . of the worst kind. A betrayal of the patients, of the families, and of . the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give . their patients the high-quality, compassionate care they deserve. ‘The health and care system must . change. We cannot merely tinker around the edges – we need a radical . overhaul with high-quality care and compassion at its heart.’ As revealed by the Mail yesterday, . student nurses will be made to work for a year as healthcare assistants . on wards to give them experience of hands-on care. Ministers will also . appoint a chief inspector of hospitals and a chief inspector of care . homes who will rate organisations. Campaigners, including relatives of those who died at Mid Staffordshire said the measures didn’t go far enough. Julie Bailey, who set up Cure the NHS . after the death of her mother, said: ‘We need safe staffing levels and . the correct skill mix, that’s the start that’s needed, then we need to . look at the training. ‘I think there needs to be far more . emphasis on who they select to go into nursing. We’ve got staff who . don’t want to work for the NHS, we’ve got patients frightened, older . people frightened to go into NHS hospitals. ‘This has got to change, and it’s not . going to change with this style of leadership, command and control. We . need much more emphasis on the culture and behaviours of the people . within the NHS, and that starts at the top.’","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wants to put greater emphasis on old-fashioned care .

"By . Reuters/ap . PUBLISHED: . 15:50 EST, 19 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:17 EST, 19 July 2013 . Hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, founder and chairman of SAC Capital Advisors, faces charges in the insider trading fraud case . Hedge fund mogul Steven A. Cohen failed to supervise two employees who are facing insider trading charges, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have accused. The SEC charges are part of a long-running probe of Cohen, 57, and his $15 billion hedge fund by regulators and federal investigators in which nine one-time SAC employees have been charged or implicated. SAC Capital Advisors is among the largest hedge funds in the world and this case is one of the biggest insider-trading fraud cases in history. The SEC's action today said Cohen failed to supervise former portfolio manager Mathew Martoma and SAC . Capital Advisors executive Michael Steinberg. 'Cohen ignored the red flags and allowed Martoma and Steinberg to execute the trades' in several stocks where the SEC found evidence of insider trading, the agency said. The charges are not part of a civil lawsuit filed on court; rather, they are contained in an administrative proceeding. In a statement announcing the proceeding, the SEC said it would determine a penalty during the proceeding. It is seeking to bar Cohen from the financial industry. 'The SEC's administrative proceeding has no merit,' said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC Capital. 'Steve Cohen acted appropriately at all times and will fight this charge vigorously. 'The SEC ignores SAC's exceptional supervisory structure, its extensive compliance policies and procedures, and Steve Cohen's strong support for SAC's compliance program.' Michael Steinberg (left) and one of his attorneys leave Manhattan Federal Court in NYC in March - Steinberg was arrested by FBI for insider trading . Cohen failed to supervise SAC Capital Advisors executive Michael Steinberg (pictured front left), who is accused of insider trading at the billionaire's hedge fund . The 17-page administrative order charges that in the matters involving Steinberg and Martoma, Cohen 'received highly suspicious information that should have caused any reasonable hedge fund manager in Cohen's position' to determine whether the employees had acted appropriately. The order also charges that Cohen 'tagged' some of the positions undertaken by the two men in his own portfolio, which entitled them to additional compensation. Cohen personally oversees about $4 billion, along with a small group of traders, in a portfolio called 'the Cohen account', which represents a good chunk of the estimated $6 billion he has invested with his 21 year old hedge fund, Reuters has previously reported. SAC Capital Advisors is among the largest of hedge funds and was founded by Steven Cohen . The bulk of the allegations in the administrative order mirror previous allegations the SEC has filed in civil complaints against Martoma and Steinberg, as well as the criminal indictments against the two men. 'I think they don't have the evidence for insider trading so they brought this,' said Thomas Gorman, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney who is not connected to the case, of the SEC charges against Cohen. 'Bringing a case like this under circumstances here is going to be a difficult proof problem for them,' Gorman said. 'They are going to have to show that Mr. Cohen was not only in charge but that basically he didn't act in good faith. If he acted in good faith and did not induce these acts directly or indirectly then he's not liable.'","Steven A.

An aspiring hedge fund manager who confessed earlier this year to killing a 15-year-old boy in 1990 has been sentenced to 30 years in prison today. Steven Goff, who was sentenced to aggravated manslaughter, told the victim's family in court: 'I wanted to give you your justice. You deserve to see me suffer.' The 41-year-old had confessed to police in April, after saying he was haunted by a vision of the mother of his victim, Frederick Hart, 23 years after stabbing him. Plea: Steven Goff, of Ventnor, pleaded guilty when he made his first court appearance in June . Cold case suspect: Steven Goff, left, and his 15-year-old victim Frederick Hart, right, in 1990 . Under a plea agreement, Goff was sentenced to 30 years in prison and can apply for parole in 15 years, according to The Press of Atlantic City. '[Goff] was free longer than my uncle was alive and breathing on this earth,' Frederick's niece, Jessica Culp, told the judge. She was nine when her uncle was stabbed to death behind his house. His decomposed body was found by a hunter 19 months later. Although some members of the victim's family have said they will forgive Goff, others have questioned why he did not come forward at the time. According . to The Press of Atlantic City, they said they knew Goff was the killer, . but an alleged jailhouse confession while he was in prison for . burglary, could not be used. Goff . was ordered to look at Frederick's family, as they sat crying in court, . as he was told: 'We're burying Freddie all over again.' After saying he knew 'sorry' was not enough, Goff explained that he had considered turning himself in three years ago. 'I know it's reopening old wounds,' he told the court. 'You deserve to see me suffer.' The self-proclaimed maths genius and aspiring hedge fund manager told a . judge in June that he was an 18-year-old 'in a rage' when he stabbed . Frederick and left him to die in . Galloway Township. Goff's attorney, James Leonard Jr.,said his client . wanted to get the killing 'off his chest' and bring closure to the . victim's family. Punished: Steven Goff told his victim's family 'You deserve to see me suffer' as he was sentenced . The New Jersey man turned himself in . in April because he was haunted by nightmares in which the victim’s . mother appeared before him, according to the suspect's best friend. Alan Rickel has told how Goff confided earlier that he was tortured by what he had done decades ago. ‘He . couldn't bear it anymore,’ Mr Rickel said. ‘He told me he had . nightmares. He'd go to sleep and see the kid's mother staring in his . face.’ ‘He said, “Al, you're not going to see me anymore. I'm going to do something that will shock the world,”’ he added. Mr Rickel said he knew Goff had psychological problems, and figured he was going through one of his periodic dark spells. Earlier . this year, Goff called Rickel from northern Michigan. He said he had . decided to return to New Jersey and take responsibility for having done . something horrible. ‘He . said he was going to meet his maker and “fess up to what he had done"",' Mr Rickel said. ‘I said, “I don't know what you're talking about, but . just come back and I'll get you some medicine and some help"".' Unsolved murder: Police say Goff was 18 years old when he murdered Hart and left his body to decompose for more than a year in Galloway Township, New Jersey . ‘I thought he might be having a psychotic breakdown. He said, “No, it's much worse than that"".' Mr . Rickel said he wired his friend $500 to help him get back home. The . next call he got was from Galloway Township police on April 1, saying . Goff had confessed to a cold-case murder. Police . and investigators from the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office said . Goff had told him details about the case that only the real killer would . have known, Mr Rickel said. Goff stabbed Hart multiple times with a knife in a wooded area behind the Clubs Condominiums May 7, 1990, according to police. The teen was reported missing the following day, but it was not until more than a year later that a hunter came across his remains, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The cause of death had never been determined because officials said the teenager's body had  decomposed. Goff was nearly 18 at the time of the killing. He was a senior at Absegami High School, where Frederick was a freshman. Illusions of grandeur: Goff, an aspiring hedge fund manager, described himself as a self-taught genius . At an earlier court appearance scheduled to present the murder and weapons charges to him, Goff surprised the judge by confessing and saying he was ready to enter a guilty plea, sobbing lightly as he said, 'I did the crime and I'm prepared to do the time.' Superior Court Judge Michael Donio advised Goff that he had to wait until being indicted by a grand jury before he could enter a plea. Mr Rickel met Goff 10 years ago and the . two became friends. He said Goff was a skilled mechanic, plumber and . electrician. But every once in a while, he would have what his friend . described as ‘a rough spell.’ ‘I always thought it was that he was a . moody guy, but now it's obvious that it was because of this,’ he said. ‘He had some demons in him.’ For the past several years, Goff has been very active online, blogging and tweeting about the stock market, economics and politics. Dark past: Goff revealed in an online bio that he was sentenced to five years in prison when he was 18 . Goff apparently has been dabbling in stock trading but hoped to become a hedge fund manager. But according to his online biography, Goff had a dark criminal past that included a five-year prison sentence on drug charges which he received when he was 18 – around the time of the killing. Speaking about his past bad decisions, the 41-year-old wrote that he was a ‘master safe cracker thief, liar, professional slot machine cheat,’ a bad father, bad brother and bad son who had been stabbed and shot at. On another blog site, Goff lamented that his being a convicted felon has kept him from realizing his ‘BIG IDEAS for this world and our species on this planet.’ ‘I am now hindered from ever sitting for a LAW BAR exam or a series 7 brokers [sic] exam. Or from ever becoming a teacher,’ he wrote. ‘I am MOST p***** that I can never be called upon to defend my nation in service if need be. They will never let me ever touch a firearm ever again.’ Since his arrest friends have posted messages of support on Goff’s Facebook page and arranged for his beloved dog Biscuit to be adopted.","Steven Goff turned himself in after being haunted by visions of victim's mother .

Not if a recently unearthed collection of acerbic letters written by Queen Victoria is any indication. The collection of more than 20 untidy handwritten notes contain a form of text speak where the monarch substituted words for abbreviations including 'wh' for 'which', 'shd' for 'should', 'abt' for 'about' and 'wd.' for 'would'. All of the correspondence, which will go under the hammer next month, is addressed to James Forbes, the man responsible for running Balmoral on her behalf. Fascinating: The handwritten notes reveal Queen Victoria's familiarity with text speak as well as her kindness . Considerate: The ageing monarch's notes show her to have been a concerned employer . They were written during the last four years of her life and form part of an archive worth between £6,000 and £8,000 according to the auction house. They show the Queen’s keen interest in . the welfare of her staff and tenants and continued appetite for life . despite her advancing years. All are written on the heavy mourning . paper she adopted on the death of Prince Albert in 1861 and most are . signed VR1. They were sent from Windsor, Osborne, the home she shared . with Albert, and Nice as well as internally at Balmoral itself. Bonhams book specialist Henry Baggott . said: 'These letters throw a fascinating light on the private Queen . Victoria and show her to have been far kinder and more considerate than . her rather forbidding public image suggested.' Along with the letters, a collection of three handkerchiefs which carry the VR monogram and a hat pin case made in bone reportedly owned by the queen will go on sale in Edinburgh next month. But it is the intimate letters that are the source of the most excitement, not least because of the unusual abbreviations. Bonhams spokesman Andrew Currie added: 'The writing is quite untidy and the abbreviations are interesting, a sort of early form of texting which suggest Queen Victoria was a hundred years ahead of her time. Important: The letters will go on sale alongside a collection of Royal memorabilia, including personal items . Scotland: All of the monarch's letters are to James Forbes, commissioner of Balmoral Castle (pictured) 'Wh' - which . 'Shd' - should . 'Abt' - about . 'Wd' - would . 'Sales of this sort are not that rare, but what is unusual is the letters show the Queen was keen to strike up personal relationships with her staff, showing her concern for her household, tenants and neighbours at Balmoral. 'The letters are, in places, outspoken and give a vivid impression of the Queen’s personality. There is a range of people who will be interested, from collectors of royal memorabilia to museums and public bodies.' In one Victoria advises Forbes on how to handle the tricky minister at Balmoral by advising him to 'be very careful to be exact & very discreet & keep out of rows (like the choir trouble) or writing in any of the papers wh. was one of Mr Sibald’s accusations last year. 'But I fear Mr S. is of a vindictive spirit & I rather fear, not very exact himself. At any rate you shd try & find out the story abt the Free Kirk Minister, as I am sure that that is a ""mistake"".' Victoria was always solicitous about her staff whom she regarded as part of her extended family. On the death of Lizzie Brown, the wife of William who was brother to the Queen’s favourite, John, she wrote: 'The death of dear excellent Mrs Wm Brown whom I was so very fond of and with whom I had been so intimate is real grief to me & I dare not think of how dreadfully I shall miss her. 'Her loss is really irreparable... Poor William I do pity so much for he is so helpless & dear Lizzie was everything in the world to him.' The Queen’s views of her aristocratic neighbours, however, were less charitable: 'I have never invited the Duke of Atholl to come over with his men and I think it wd. be better not to do so this year. It wd. entail the encampment of his men in our grounds wh. wd. be inconvenient.' Also included in the lot are other items that reveal Victoria's closeness to the Forbes family, among them a watercolour calendar illustrated with portraits of the Forbes’s three children and inscribed by the monarch to Mrs Forbes.","The monarch used abbreviations such as 'wh.', 'shd' and 'abt'

A 65-year-old woman has died after having an allergic reaction from a fire ant sting as she relaxed by her swimming pool in Georgia. Jenny Pomeroy, who went into anaphylactic shock after being stung at her condo last week, died in hospital from complications related to the reaction. The grandmother, who had been chief executive of a blind charity for 17 years, knew she was allergic to the ants' venom and carried an autoinjector, but she couldn't be saved. 'This is just so hard to believe and unexpected,' Laurie Irby, who worked with Mrs Pomeroy at Prevent Blindness Georgia, told ABC News. Mrs Pomeroy, who was chief executive officer of the Atlanta charity, had been treated in hospital 20 years ago after an allergic reaction to the ants. 'Jenny knew that she was allergic to fire ants and was always very aware of her surroundings,' Ms Irby said. For most people, a fire ant sting will cause welts, itching and swelling, but for those who are allergic to the venom, it can cause vomiting, difficulty breathing and swallowing and, in extreme cases, a fatal drop in blood pressure. Mrs Pomeroy carried an epinephrine autoinjector, which quickly delivers life-saving drugs into the blood stream, and her husband immediately called 911 when his wife was stung at their condo after work. A statement released to neighbors at her Buckhead condo said: 'We all feel the terrible sorrow for the loss of our close personal friend and board president.' Close: Grandmother Jenny Pomeroy, left, with her family, has been remembered for her selfless nature . The co-chairmen of Prevent Blindness Georgia, Scott Pastor and Amy Hutchinson, released a statemement on Tuesday saying: 'Jenny . will forever be remembered as an innovative thinker and a selfless, . dedicated leader in Atlanta and across the state of Georgia. We will . miss her deeply.' Atlanta has a big problem with fire ants, which are believed to have arrived in the U.S. in the 1930s on board trade ships. They can now be found in 13 states, including Georgia, and are believed to be the number one cause of insect bites in the U.S. They bite their victim to get a good grip before injecting the venom. For people with an allergy, the reaction becomes more severe with age. However, an allergist at the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma clinic, said many people were not aware that those who are allergic to the venom can be given a course of treatment to build up their immunity. Venomous: Fire ants are believed to be the number one cause of insect bites in the U.S. 'The best treatment is allergy . shots because they're very effective at helping . patients build a tolerance so that when they're stung again, they don't . have a reaction,' Dr Stanley Fineman said. The shots carry small but increasing doses of the venom to help patients build up an immunity over five years. More than 500,000 Americans seek emergency treatment for insect stings each year and about 40 are killed from insect sting anaphylaxis, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.","65-year-old grandmother had severe allergy to insect venom .

Six Colombians have been charged over the kidnap and murder of an American agent who was targeted in a 'millionaire's ride' sting in a taxi in Bogota. James 'Terry' Watson, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, was apparently kidnapped by his taxi driver and a number of accomplices who believed he was wealthy. According to an indictment from the U.S. Justice Department, he was attacked by a stun gun and then stabbed before escaping from the taxi. Although Mr Watson, 42, managed to reach a hospital, he later died of his knife injuries following the incident on June 20. Six suspects have now been indicted by a federal grand jury, charged with second-degree murder, kidnapping and conspiracy to kidnap. The men charged are Gerardo Figueroa Sepulveda, Omar Fabian Valdes Gualtero, Edgar Javier Bello Murillo, Hector Leonardo Lopez, Julio Estiven Gracia Ramierez and Andrés Alvaro Oviedo-Garcia. Wilson Daniel Peralta-Bocachica has also been charged with attempting to destroy evidence linked to the murder. 'With today's arrests, we take an important step towards ensuring that those allegedly responsible for his senseless murder are brought to justice,' Attorney General Eric Holder said. The six men were members of a kidnap gang which targeted rich tourists in a scam known as the 'paseo millonario', or 'millionaire's ride', according to the indictment. This sting was apparently triggered whenever a passenger thought to be particularly wealthy entered a taxi belonging to a conspirator. Sting: The operation known as 'millionaire's ride' involved threatening wealthy tourists in Bogota with violence . Other criminals would then pull up in their vehicle and get in to the back seat of the first car alondside the victim. They would threaten him with knives and other weapons, and force him to hand over cash, credit cards and other valuables. Mr Watson was attacked in the upmarket 93 Park district of Bogota, where he was temporarily on duty while stationed in the city of Cartagena. His murder is being investigated by the FBI, the DEA and the Diplomatic Security Service, with the help of Interpol and the Colombian police. A few days after the killing, authorities in Colombia said they had arrested four gangsters who tried to sell seats from the taxi in which Mr Watson was kidnapped. Investigators have insisted that the killing was the result of a random attack, and was not linked to the agent's work with the DEA.","James 'Terry' Watson, 42, was kidnapped and murdered in Bogota .

Aretha Franklin says Detroit's future is bright, saying that her hometown may be ""bankrupt monetarily but we are well-funded in spirit and what it takes to come back'. The 'Queen of Soul' had her publicist release a hopeful statement in light of the city's bankruptcy on Thursday. She says 'between new and dynamic leadership with the Big Three, the private sector and a little help from D.C., Detroit's best and most glorious days are still ahead'. Preach: Aretha Franklin had some encouraging words for her hometown, saying that from a little help from various friends they will be able to bring themselves back . Extreme: Detroit's emergency financial manager Kevyn Orr explains his decision to make the city file for bankruptcy . Living problems: It can take police nearly an hour to respond to a 911 call and despite razing close to 10,000 vacant houses, three times as many still stand with windows smashed and doors ripped off . The Big Three car manufacturers- Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler- were the companies that helped drive the Michigan city to its glory days in the 1950s and 1960s. Now the city is a shadow of its former self, with a host of overwhelming bills that forced the mayor to declare the region bankrupt. For decades, Detroit paid its bills by borrowing money while struggling to provide the most basic of services for its residents. It can take police nearly an hour to respond to a 911 call and despite razing close to 10,000 vacant houses, three times as many still stand with windows smashed and doors ripped off. At night, many streets and even freeways are dangerously shrouded in darkness because tens of thousands of street lights don't work. The 1950s proved to be the truly bustling time for the car factories, like the Chrysler plant seen here in 1954 . Proud of their products: The National Auto Show, seen here in 1960, was a spectacle and a way for the workers of the city to display their efforts . Before it broke: Even in 1993 the car industry was still in place, even though it had deteriorated to a shadow of its former self . The city was about to default on a good chunk of its $14billion-plus debt, but now it will get a second chance in a federal bankruptcy court-led restructuring. Detroit's budget deficit this year alone is estimated at $380million, and Kevyn Orr, its state-appointed emergency manager, chose bankruptcy over diverting money from police, fire and other services to make debt payments. The move conserves cash so the city can operate, but it will hurt Detroit's image for years. It also leaves creditors with pennies on the dollar and places in jeopardy the pension benefits of thousands of city retirees. While the drastic move may seem quick, it took decades of decay to bring down the once-mighty industrial giant that put the world on wheels. Simmering problems: Mobs overturned cars at a 1943 race rally, as tensions between white and black residents came to a head- and not for the last time . Different issues: This 1984 riot came out of celebration when the Detroit Tigers beat the San Diego Padres in the World Series . The city grew to 1.8 million people in the 1950s, luring them with plentiful jobs that paid good wages to stamp out automobiles for sale across the globe. But like many American cities, Detroit's fall began late that decade as developers starting building suburbs. Then came the 1967 riots that accelerated the number of white residents who moved to the cities north of Eight Mile Road, considered the region's racial dividing line. Rapper Eminem starred in the movie he created about the infamous road, bringing the notion of the tough streets surrounding Eight Mile to a national audience. At the same time, auto companies began opening plants in other cities, and the rise of autos imported from Japan started to cut the size of the U.S. auto industry. Detroit's property values fell, tax revenue dropped, police couldn't control a growing murder rate, and many middle-class blacks fled the city for safer suburbs with better schools. Back when it was booming: The 'Seven Sisters' smokestacks (seen here in 1996) were a poignant display of how pivotal industry was to the heart of the city . Native sons: Singers Eminem and Kid Rock are both from the city, and Eminem made a movie about the infamous Eight Mile Road . By 2009, the auto industry collapsed along with the economy as a whole, eventually pulling the city down with it. Government corruption under former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick only made things worse. In the 2000 census, Detroit's population fell under 1 million in as the exodus continued. Today it's barely above 700,000. Unlike a business that declares bankruptcy, the city faces a number of structural and logistical challenges that may impede a speedy recovery. Structural issues: With so many abandoned and ransacked buildings, city administrators will likely have trouble bringing people back to the areas needed to have a flourishing city . Bust: After its boom years Detroit began a steady decline . Industry: Factories such as the Packard Automotive Plant, which helped Detroit become wealthy, are now abandoned . Whereas companies can cut departments and outsource to cheaper regions, Detroit can't send its decaying neighborhoods elsewhere. Thousands of retired city workers could lose at least part of their pension benefits. Concessions could be forced upon dozens of city unions, including pay and benefit cuts. Creditors whom Detroit owes more than $14billion will have to take pennies on the dollar. Desolate: The once-thriving city is struggling to convince residents to stay . That said, free of these financial burdens, Detroit will be able to concentrate its limited dollars on services such as basic police and fire protection. Better services could bring more people and lure more business investment. Already the downtown and an area to the north called Midtown are seeing business and residential growth - signs that Detroit has a future.","Detroit filed for bankruptcy as it is more than $14billion in debt .

A gardener has said they have even left bottles of urine in a children's playground. It comes just days after Romanian beggars returned to Park Lane, near Marble Arch, where they are now sleeping rough - fuelling concern of a repeat of last year's long running saga. Residents of Bryanston Square in Marylebone, claim half a dozen of the migrants sneak into the gardens at night, leaving rubbish and human waste behind . Locals say a group of about five or six Romanians have been sleeping rough in Bryanston Square gardens for over a year, despite efforts by police to move them on . The picturesque garden is reserved for the affluent residents, yet late at night the gang scale the spiked fences to sleep . Bryanston Square is one of London's most exclusive areas . A 40-strong group moved into the area ahead of last year's Olympics, turning the site into a rubbish dump. They were also accused of knife-point robberies and other crimes. Now locals say a group of about five or six Romanians have been sleeping rough in Bryanston Square gardens for over a year, despite efforts by police to move them on. A two bedroom flat in the area is currently on the market for £2million. The picturesque garden is reserved for the affluent residents, yet late at night the gang scale the spiked fences to sleep. A worker in the gardens, who did not want to give his name, said the group have made their home in there, bringing blankets and duvets to keep warm. They then leave early in the morning or when police kick them out, often leaving behind two litre bottles filled with urine, he said. He said: 'I have seen them here many times in the morning. They sleep at the end in the playground. It is usually the women here but sometimes they are with men. 'They sometimes leave behind their electric blankets and duvets.

It comes just days after Romanian beggars returned to Park Lane, near Marble Arch, where they are now sleeping rough . The group have taken over a patch of grass near Marble Arch and it is feared they may set up a camp . 'We must clean up because there are young children coming to play there.'

'But this England we have the welfare system and salvation army. You cant just come to one of the richest parts of London and just set up camp.' He said police regularly patrol the area, moving the gang on. He said: 'They are around here a lot. One policemen said to me 'don't feel sorry for them, they are scum'. 'I do resent them. Firstly for what they leave behind for us to pick up but also because they don't work. I work hard for not much money, yet all they do is spend their time begging.' One resident, living on Byranston Square, added: 'Yes it is a worry because who would want to move in around here with neighbours like that. 'Houses around here are extremely expensive so obviously if you have this sort of problem then it would put you off. I would not move here now. 'Will house prices go down? It is possible.'

These people whom are leaking this information are profiting off it at the expense of the WWE, the fans, and the integrity of the product,’ he wrote. ‘It is for these reasons that I am hoping to put an end to WWE insiders leaking PPV outcomes.’ Since this post, Dolphins1925 had predicted more matches, at the Payback and Money in the Bank events. Response: Dolphins recently predicted the Payback event results and only last week did WWE respond, saying 'We may have a modern day Nostradamus on our hands.' The company either wasn’t paying attention or didn’t care enough to shake things up by changing a match’s outcome to make Dolphins1925’s predictions wrong. That is, Deadspin reports, until Monday. ‘We may have a modern day Nostradamus on our hands,’ WWE told the sports blog. ‘We might have to monitor these posts in advance of our next pay-per-view to see how good he or she really is.’ That next event is next month’s Summer Slam and Dolphins1925 has yet to give his predictions.  Though, when he does, they’re sure to get the most attention of any he’s made to date.","User Dolphins1925 has somehow infiltrated the scripted world of pay-per-view pro-wrestling matches .

Parents of an 8-week-old baby were arrested  after their son died Thursday evening from injuries sustained from being shaken. Police in Seminole County responded to a child abuse report on July 11 at the loft where 26-year-old Joshua Stuart was taking care of his newborn son Eli Heath. Apparently Stuart started shaking the baby when Eli wouldn't stop crying after being fed a bottle. Arrested: 26-year-old Joshua Stuart, left, and 24-year-old Jessica Heath, right, were parents for only 8 weeks when their son Eli died at their hands . By the time police arrived at the family's warehouse loft near Longwood, Eli was limp, bleeding from the nose and not breathing. Eli was rushed to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children where doctors found fractures on the baby's body and injuries consistent with being shaken. Doctors were not optimistic that the child would survive, and on Thursday the baby succumbed to his injuries. Since the shaking incident, both of Eli's parents have been arrested for child abuse. Stuart originally ran away from police when they discovered the child, but he was later apprehended at Altamonte Springs. Stuart was arrested for aggravated child abuse, but police tagged on a homicide charge Friday after the baby's death. The boy's mother, 24-year-old Jessica Heath, has also been arrested on charges of child neglect with great bodily harm. Heath wasn't at the warehouse at the time of the incident, but was responsible for the baby's fussiness. She was supposed to give Eli medicine to treat a medical condition that required a strict regimen. As of Friday, both parents were still in custody.","Joshua Stuart's 8-week-old son Eli was being fussy since his mother hadn't given him medicine for a medical condition .

A schoolgirl was repeatedly raped by newspaper tycoon Eddy Shah after being 'sold' to him for £650, a court heard today. Prostitute Susan Davies allegedly handed the 14-year-old over to the businessman for sex in order to settle her credit card debts. The victim told a jury at the Old Bailey that she was forced to visit Shah's 'grand' suites with 'high ceilings' in top London hotels and perform sex acts on him. In the second day of testimony in the rape trial of Shah, Davies and her former lover Anthony Pallant, the woman, now 34, described the first time she was allegedly abused by the founder of Today. Accused: Eddy Shah, pictured outside the Old Bailey today with his wife Jennifer, is on trial for rape . Shah, 69, handed the cash over to Davies, 53, the victim said, adding: 'She said it was the most money he had ever given her. 'I was sold for £650 to pay for credit card bills.' The tycoon then had sex with her on up to eight occasions over the next 12 months at a series of luxury hotels, she claimed, but never gave her money or gifts. She said that Davies once told her Shah might buy her a porcelain doll from the Radisson Edwardian hotel. 'He never did buy me one of the dolls,' she continued. 'They were dressed as Tudor Kings and Queens of England. I had an interest in history and the Tudor period.' Defendants: Susan Davies and Anthony Pallant, pictured outside court today, are also accused of raping the girl . Recalling the first time she attacked her, the victim said: 'I didn’t want to have sex with Eddy Shah but I was told I would be doing it. I knew what was coming and I just complied.' She said she was forced into a threesome with Shah and Davies, at either the Grosvenor House Hotel or the Dorchester. 'She was lying on the bed next to me,' the alleged victim said. 'There was a point when she was giving Eddy Shah oral sex. ‘I was told to take my clothes off. I just wanted it to be over, full stop. He was lying on top of me. ‘What stuck out in my mind was lying on my back and him having sex with me and him looking deep into my eyes - an intense, penetrating look. I remember wondering what he was thinking.' She said that she had first met Shah at the Grosvenor House Hotel, and Davies had insisted she dress smartly for him. 'She told me he was the owner of Today newspaper,' the alleged victim told the court. 'She used to read the newspaper. 'Eddie always had a suite, it was never a room. It had high ceilings and it was quite grand.' Tycoon: Shah pictured with Margaret Thatcher at an awards ceremony in 1984 . After Shah and Davies discussed a business proposal, the jury heard, they went into a bedroom together. 'At that point when they left the room it dawned on me they had left the room to have sex,’ the woman said today. Then Shah came back into the living room and knelt down in front of her, the court heard. ‘He just asked me if I wanted to go through and join them,’ said the woman. ‘He said it as casually as if he wanted me to join him for lunch or a cup of coffee. ‘I didn’t speak. I just shook my head. I knew exactly what that suggestion meant. I was shocked. I had not anticipated it. I was a bit naive.’ Davies later drove her home and told her: ‘You will be doing it the next f***ing time,’ the court heard. ‘She meant I was to be joining them for sexual activity in threesomes, like she got me involved with Tony Pallant,’ the woman said. Davies allegedly forced the girl to have sex with her lover Pallant on multiple occasions. The court has heard how Davies gave the girl a bra, a pair of knickers and a suspender belt on her twelfth birthday and joined in when she was made to have sex with Pallant. The woman told the court she became ‘robotic’, adding: ‘I knew it wasn’t right but I just complied with what they wanted.’ Shah, who is charged under his real name Selim Shah, ran the now-defunct Today newspaper and was best known for bringing in new technology and colour printing. He, Davies and Pallant are charged with 13 separate sex attacks on the girl between 1991 and 1995, all of which they deny. The trial continues.

Britain’s borders should be closed to immigrants while the country’s own citizens are struggling to find jobs, a group of MPs said last night. Frank Field and Nicholas Soames, chairmen of the influential Cross Party Group on Balanced Migration, said the Government should be able to block immigration during periods of high unemployment. The two MPs, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said Britain is facing an influx of people at an ‘unsustainable level’ despite the Coalition’s measures to reduce immigration. British workers first: MPs Frank Field (left) and Nicholas Soames (right) want EU immigration restricted when UK unemployment is high . Mr Field is a Labour MP who served as . Welfare Minister in Tony Blair’s first Government and Conservative Mr . Soames was Defence Minister under John Major. They said David Cameron specifically needs to tackle the EU - which they described as ‘the elephant in the room’. And they said next year’s expected wave of immigration from Bulgaria and Romania means that the need to tackle the issue ‘could not be more stark’. ‘[An] area that needs to be considered is whether EU members should have powers, during periods of high unemployment, to restrict the free movement of labour, at present guaranteed in EU law,’ the MPs wrote. The two MPs said Britain is facing an influx of people at an 'unsustainable level', even in the face of the Coalition's measures to reduce immigration . ‘We will seek to support the tightening . of immigration policies in the year ahead, not least to ensure that the . public can have confidence in our immigration system.’ The MPs were reacting to a speech made by David Cameron this week that set out plans to reinforce rules restricting access to benefits, the NHS and social housing for European immigrants. They said the Prime Minister’s speech sent an important message that should now be built upon - but did not go far enough. Frank Field and Nicholas Soames are chairmen of the influential Cross Party Group on Balanced Migration . They wrote: ‘Although Mr Cameron was criticised on the basis that very few migrants would be affected by his new proposals, this misses the point. ‘His purpose, instead, was to ensure that future migrants (including EU nationals) are deterred from coming here to seek benefits and services. ‘His proposals on changing the entitlement rules for benefits, social housing and the NHS are a welcome first step. ‘It is right in principle that access to services should be granted on the basis of contribution, and indeed the cross party group has been active in raising these three issues for some time, most recently calling for an entitlement card to access NHS services to replace the current system whereby anyone can access the NHS after being here for 24 hours.’ Mr Field and Mr Soames also confronted those who said cracking down on immigration would undermine economic growth. They wrote: ‘We yield to no one in our desire to ensure that immigration control does not impede the economic recovery on which so much else depends. ‘We have been forthright in our view that businesses must be able to bring in the talent it needs, and are campaigning to make the process simpler and swifter.’","Cross-party MPs say temporary closures would aid UK employment .

Simon Cowell once ordered Cheryl Cole to get rid of her ‘crazy hair’ – but it seems that the majority of women disagree. The singer’s wavy brunette hair is the most copied celebrity hairstyle in the UK, according to a study.The second most requested style is This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby’s sleek honey-coloured locks, according to hairdressers Toni & Guy. Model Kelly Brook’s loosely curled hairdo came third in the poll of 2,000 women, while fourth place went to the Duchess of Cambridge’s glossy blow-dried curls. Friends actress Jennifer Aniston, whose famous ‘Rachel cut’ inspired millions of women, was fifth with her current layered cut. Luscious locks: Cheryl Cole's long, brunette style is the most copied in the UK while women also wanted her look when she dyed her hair red, right . Sacha Mascolo-Tarbuck, of Toni & . Guy, said: ‘Cheryl’s long brunette hair has been popular for some time . now. You can wear it in curls one day, straight the next and in a smart . up-do for a night out. Perhaps that’s why they are so popular with . women.’ Cole, who models for L’Oreal hair . products, features twice in the list, with her short-lived dyed-red . hairstyle coming in sixth place. But the pop star’s hair has attracted more than its fair share of controversy in the past. She was accused of misleading fans by . taking part in a national advertising campaign for L’Oreal Elvive Full . Restore 5 shampoo and conditioner, showing off impossibly shiny hair – . which turned out to be the result of £1,000 hair extensions. In 2009 the Advertising Standards . Authority said it received 13 complaints that the adverts were . misleading, but rejected them because the disclaimer about Miss Cole’s . hair extensions was ‘clear and legible’ on the commercial. Equally controversial was the . dramatic, back-combed hairstyle that Cole sported for the launch of her . ill-fated career as a judge on American X Factor in 2011. According to Miss Cole, Cowell, who . fired her just two weeks into the show amid ‘concerns over her image’, . told her after the first day of filming: ‘The crazy hair goes tomorrow.’ The survey also found that a third of women have asked their hairdresser . to recreate the same cut or colour as their favourite celebrity. Runners up: Holly Willoughby's blonde locks, left, and Kelly Brooks brunette waves are also popular requests in UK salons . Mascolo-Tarbuck added: 'The hair styles featured at the top of the list are very versatile and can be made to look different fairly easily. 'We see millions of women each year requesting hair similar to celebrities, from Cheryl, Holly and Kelly’s classic looks right through to Rihanna’s or Rita Ora’s more daring styles. 'It will be interesting to see who the next big celebrity inspiration will be.' Hair idols: The Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Jennifer Aniston were also in the top ten . Fourth in the poll of 2,000 women was mother-to-be Kate Middleton whose brunette, slightly wavy hair has been coveted ever since her 2011 wedding to Prince William thrust her into the spotlight. Meanwhile former Friends actress Jennifer Aniston’s long layered hair still remains an inspiration for millions of women years after her famous 'Rachel cut', as she was voted fifth place. Cheryl Cole’s brief change from her signature hairstyle - mahogany-coloured waves - is at number six, followed by Cameron Diaz’s short, choppy look. TV’s New Girl star Zooey Deschanel came eighth in the poll thanks to her heavy fringe and while Kim Kardashian’s dark, glossy hair is at nine. Anne Hathaway’s short pixie crop, which she cut as part of her role in Oscar winning film Les Miserables, completed the top ten. Other celebrities to feature in the list include The Saturday’s singer Frankie Sandford with her asymmetrical pixie crop and Jessie J’s sharp bob.

Perhaps the infant will follow in the footsteps of father-to-be William, who as a search and rescue pilot is one of the few royals to have any kind of 'real' job?

Despite wanting the Royal baby to earn its keep only three in 10 polled thought the child should attend a state school, with 50 per cent strongly disagreeing. And seven in 10 agree with the statement that it will be 'impossible' for the child to have a normal upbringing. The Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed a brief career in the fashion industry before taking on a full time role as a royal, which includes attending official events and patronages of several charities . The poll also found that one year after the Jubilee celebrations support for the Royal family remains strong. Although not quite reaching the feel good factor of the summer of 2012 when 80 per cent of Britons declared their support for the monarchy, the Royal baby effect means that a huge 77 per cent of Britons questioned still counted themselves as monarchists. Only 17 per cent would like the UK to become a republic. And the public seem to be softening towards grandfather-to-be, and the current heir to the throne, Prince Charles: only 35 per cent of those questioned thought that Charles should give up his right to the throne, with the majority - 52 per cent - wanting him to keep his place in succession. Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORO said: 'The Diamond Jubilee is extending its halo, with support for the monarchy approaching all-time high levels. 'There is both sympathy for the challenges facing any children born to royalty but also a desire for Kate and William's child to experience more of a normal world of work. At the time of the Jubilee celebrations in 2012 80 per cent of Britons considered themselves to be monarchists . Young royals Prince Harry (L), Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (C), and Prince William (R) continue to inject modern appeal into the monarchy .","65 per cent of people think the Royal baby should experience a normal job .

He had a week to think about it but Nick Clegg could still only muster faint praise for stay-at-home mothers yesterday. He said parents who decided to stop work had made a ‘noble’ decision but claimed they had not been hammered by Coalition taxes. The Deputy Prime Minister was speaking on his radio programme a week after he was ambushed on the show by full-time mother Laura Perrins, who said ministers viewed her choice as ‘worthless’. Scroll down for video . On the air: Speaking on his radio show, the Deputy Prime Minister described stay at home mothers as 'noble' a week after being ambushed on the show . And last night another stay-at-home mother Claire Paye, 41, criticised Mr Clegg’s latest statement. The former banker from Reading said: ‘Describing being a mother as noble or admirable is so very condescending. Nobility has nothing to do with it. ‘Often parents do not want to go back to work but sometimes it is a necessary decision because the Government will not support them.’ Mother-of-two Mrs Perrins, who has lost her child benefit payments, had attacked the decision to restrict childcare tax breaks worth up to £1,200 a year per child to working mothers. Last week she tore into Mr Clegg saying: ‘I’m just wondering why the Coalition is discriminating against mothers like me who care for their children at home. You probably think what I do is a worthless job.’ Yesterday Mr Clegg was presented with the results of an international study by the Organisation for Economic and Cooperation Development, showing single-earner families have paid more tax than others under the Coalition. The Lib Dem leader floundered as he was presented with OECD figures on taxes paid by single-earner families . Presenter Nick Ferrari said Mrs . Perrins, 32, had left him a message to say: ‘I would just ask him to . look at the OECD report again and think about the impact that these . policies are having on families up and down Britain.’ The . Lib Dem leader, whose wife Miriam is a high-powered lawyer, floundered . as he refused to discuss the figures and said it was not his job to . judge parents’ decisions to stay at home. He . said: ‘I don’t want to get into all the number crunching on this. I . don’t actually accept that a lot of the measures that we’ve taken are . somehow penalising mums – or indeed dads – who take the totally . admirable decision [to stay at home]. 'I’m . also a parent, I know these are incredibly important decisions about . how you juggle work and family … these very kind of noble decisions that . many, many parents have taken, to say no, for a few years or maybe . permanently, they’re going to dedicate themselves to their children.’ The . OECD study found the average UK family with one working parent and two . children lost 27.9 per cent of their wages in tax in 2012, compared with . 26.2 per cent in 2009, before the Coalition was elected.

Firefighters rushed to the blaze in the early hours of this morning and tried to rescue the man, aged in his 60s from the burning bungalow. Paramedics were also called to the single-storey terraced home but the man was tragically pronounced dead at the scene.

Police confirmed that they were treating the incident as a suspicious death . and neighbours spoke of forensic investigators marking out a trail . along the pathway from the house to a nearby car. Emergency services were called to the bungalow just after midnight after reports of a fire in the single-storey terrace.

Emergency: Fire crews were called out to the bungalow in the early hours of this morning but were unable to save the man . Suspect: Police were treating the incident as a suspicious and neighbours spoke of forensic investigators marking out a trail along the pathway from the house to a nearby car . 'He has been living there a few years now. He was a builder or something like that. 'He used to have a green van and I had always seen stuff like building materials outside.'The residents were allowed back to their homes around 4am.

Flying British: Argentina's President Cristina Kirchner has decided to hire a luxury jet from Chapman Freeborn . Just days after her latest attack on British sovereignty of the Falklands, Argentina's President Cristina Kirchner has been forced to ground her luxury jet over fears it will be seized as part of a debt row - and hire another from a British firm. Mrs Kirchner will spend £622,000 on a Bombardier Global Express jet from charter company Chapman Freeborn for her upcoming tour of Asia. Valued at £30million, the luxury plane has a stateroom with a bed, satellite, wi-fi and staff to serve drinks. Her own Boeing 757, codenamed Tango 1 and valued at £40million, has been grounded for 'technical reasons', according to officials. But sources said there were real concerns the jet could be confiscated as it lands on foreign soil. In October, the A.R.A. Libertad, the Argentinian naval flagship which is valued at £10million, was seized after New York billionaire Paul Singer obtained a court order in Ghana. Singer's Elliot Management Corp owns $1.6billion of Argentine debt, a drop in the ocean of the country's record $95 billion default from 2001. The decision to hire a Bombardier is likely to cause embarrassment for the president, whose government has called for a boycott of British business. And only last week, Mrs Kirchner sparked outrage when in an open letter to Prime Minister David Cameron she demanded Britain negotiate the sovereignty of the Falklands. In response, The Sun published a letter to the 59-year-old leader in Argentina's main English language Buenos Aires Herald, which pointed out Britain had sovereignty there before Argentina existed. The letter stated: 'British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands dates back to 1765, before the Republic of Argentina even existed. 'In the name of our millions of readers, HANDS OFF!' It added: 'Until the people of the Falkland Islands choose to become Argentinian, they remain resolutely British.' Luxury in the skies: The Bombardier Global Express jet boasts 13 seats and a stateroom with a bed . The letter prompted some angry scenes in the South American capital, with protesters burning British flags and copies of the newspaper in the street. Meanwhile Mr Cameron has insisted the islanders should be granted the right to self-determination under the UN. He said: ‘They’re holding a referendum this year and I hope the president of Argentina will listen to that referendum and recognise it is for the Falkland Islanders to choose their future.’ At risk: Sources fear the presidential plane, Tango 1, will be confiscated on a tour of Asia . Fire of fury: Protestors were angered by a letter from The Sun printed in the Buenos Aires Herald . David Cameron today vowed he would fight to keep the Falklands in British hands, as Argentinian rhetoric mounts over the future of the islands. The Prime Minister insisted British resolve was 'extremely strong' and pointed out fast jets and troops are stationed on the Falklands. It comes after Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner accused Britain of colonialism and demanded the islands were handed over. In an open letter published as an advert in The Guardian she said Argentina was forcibly stripped of the Malvinas - the Argentinian name for the islands - in 'a blatant exercise of 19th-Century colonialism'. Mr Cameron insisted he was 'absolutely clear' that Britain would defend the islands and said the UK still has one of the top five defence budgets in the world despite a raft of recent cuts to the armed forces. He told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I get regular reports on this entire issue because I want to know that our defences are strong, our resolve is extremely strong.' Asked if Britain would fight to keep the islands, he replied: 'Of course we would and we have strong defences in place on the Falkland islands. That is absolutely key, that we have fast jets stationed there, that we have troops stationed on the Falklands.'","President Cristina Kirchner will spend £622,000 on a Bombardier Global Express jet from company Chapman Freeborn .

WNBA star Brittney Griner has opened up more than ever about the intense bullying she suffered at school, revealing it was so bad at times she thought 'I don't even want to be alive.' Griner, who on Wednesday night was named 'Best Female College Athlete' for her 2012-13 season at Baylor at the ESPY Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, said she was still haunted by the memories of her peers refusing to believe she was a girl, questioning her sexual orientation and even groping her physically. 'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 with a wingspan of 88 inches. She publicly came out as a lesbian in April, ahead of the WNBA draft. Winner: WNBA player Brittney Griner, pictured, attends The 2013 ESPY Awards at Nokia Theatre L.A. where she won an award . In an honest interview with the Los Angeles Times, the Phoenix Mercury powerhouse described one day in seventh grade when class had just let out and the hallway was flooded with students. As Griner made her way through the crowd, a male student stopped her. 'You're a dude,' he said. 'I just stood there and took it. I was humiliated. The whole school was laughing at me,' Griner recalled to The Times. 'When I was younger, it really bothered . me to the point where I was like ""I don't even want to be alive; why am I . getting treated like that?""' Griner said. 'But as I got older, I . started caring less.' She said she told her mother she liked girls after her first day of high school. 'I felt a release, I felt better,' Griner said. 'She was so cool about it. She was like ""I kinda already know, and I love you.""' Her father, a former Marine, didn't take it so well and tension between the two saw Griner move out in her senior year. Despite her tumultuous home life, on court she shone, leading her team from Houston's Nimitz High to the Texas Division 5A girls' basketball state championship game and becoming America's most sought after recruit. Bullying: The Phoenix Mercury star, pictured in June, has opened up more than ever about the intense bullying she suffered in school, with some peers even calling her 'a dude' Tall: 'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 and has a wingspan of 88 inches . But she was still subject to nasty taunts from opposing sides, which left her regularly crying alone in her room after games, she told The Times. She went off to college at Baylor with a resolution to block out the negativity and not let bullying affect her. And by the end of sophomore year she succeeded. But she said she chose to publicly come out in April, regardless of the fallout, to give young girls experiencing the same nightmare someone to look up to. 'I didn't have a real role model that I could look up to that was out openly,' she told The Times. 'I knew there were a lot of younger girls that needed someone.' In May, Griner revealed how her former coach at Baylor told players to keep details of their sexuality under wraps for fear of damaging recruitment possibilities. The top pick of the WNBA draft recalled being told by Kim Mulkey that talking openly about her homosexuality could damage the reputation of the basketball program. Though Griner said she never hid the fact that she was gay from friends and family, she found at Baylor there was 'an unwritten law' that players shouldn't discuss their sexual preferences. Secret's out: Former Baylor women's basketball star Brittney Griner says that head coach, Kim Mulkey, told players not to be open publicly about their sexuality . Speaking to ESPN in May, she recalled: '... it was just kind of, like, one of those things, you know, just don't do . it. They kind of tried to make it, like, 'Why put your business out on . the street like that?'"" The 6-foot-8 basketball champion . acknowledged that she is gay in the media in April and talked about . being bullied while growing up. 'It was hard. Just being picked on for . being different. Just being bigger, my sexuality, everything,' Griner told Sports Illustrated. 'I overcame it and got over it. Definitely something that I am . very passionate about. In the ESPN interview she explained that when Kim Mulkey recruited her, she was honest about who she was. Still friends: Griner explained in an interview that Kim Mulkey (right) and staff at Baylor thought being open about sexual preferences could potentially damage the programme's recruitment success and reputation . History: Griner (pictured hugging Mulkey) will start with the Phoenix Mercury this season . 'I told Coach [Mulkey] when she was . recruiting me. I was like, ""I'm gay. I hope that's not a problem,"" and . she told me that it wasn't,' Griner said. 'I mean, my teammates knew, . obviously they all knew. Everybody knew about it.' But when one of Griner's tweets to an . ex-girlfriend was noticed by an staffer at Baylor, she was told to take . the post down by 'someone in the office.' 'It was a recruiting thing,' Griner . added. 'The coaches thought that if it seemed like they condoned it, . people wouldn't let their kids come play for Baylor.' Baylor University is a rigidly . Baptist university in Texas that discourages students from participating . in 'advocacy groups which promote understandings of sexuality that are . contrary to biblical teaching.' Star: Griner dominated NCAA and was number one in last month's WNBA draft . Mulkey did not comment directly in . response to Griner's remarks but said in a statement earlier in May: . 'Brittney Griner represented Baylor University proudly on and off the . basketball court, and she leaves behind an incredible legacy. 'I cannot comment on personal matters . surrounding any of our student-athletes, but I can tell you Brittney . will always be a celebrated member of the Baylor family.' In an interview in April, when asked about why more female athletes were out as opposed to men, Griner replied: 'I really couldn't give an answer on why that's so different. Being one that's out, it's just being who you are.' 'Don't worry about what other people are going to say because they're . always going to say something. 'But if you're just true to yourself, let . that shine through. Don't hide who you really are,' she continued. Top: Brittney Griner, left, shakes hands with WNBA President Laurel J.

'It really wasn't too difficult. I wouldn't say I was hiding or . anything like that,' Griner said. 'I've always been open about who I am . and my sexuality, so it wasn't hard at all. 'If I can show that I'm out . and I'm fine and everything's OK, then hopefully the younger generation . will definitely feel the same way.'","The Phoenix Mercury star came out as a lesbian before the WNBA draft in April .

Police were called to a home on Wednesday after a woman claimed the dogs - who she believed were vicious wolves or coyotes - dragged her cat down a creek bank and cornered her husband. Officers said they tried to deter the mud-covered dogs with pepper spray, but had to shoot when they turned on police. Tragic: Police fatally shot three-year-old Siberian Huskies Atka and Kenai thinking they were vicious coyotes . However Lindsay Schild, owner of three-year-old Atka and Kenai, claimed the shooting was unjustified. She said her dogs, which had escaped from a relative's yard in nearby Liberty Point, were not aggressive. 'I just want justice for my damn dogs,' Schild told Fox 32. Schild's sister Kara Michalec said the family pets had never attacked anyone. 'They [police] . had said in the report they weren't being aggressive,' Michalec told Fox 32. 'Why did they take such vicious actions right away? 'And my question is . if they were gonna put the animals down or they had to shoot them, why . did each dog have to be shot several times?' Examiner.com reported that officers fatally shot each dog at least three to four times. Devastated: Owner Lindsay Schild (left) and her sister Kara Michalec claimed the Siberian Huskies were not aggressive . But police chief Peter Land said officers had no choice but to shoot after using pepper spray and making loud noises to try to scare the dogs away. 'We know now that they were two dogs, however based on their aggressive nature and physical appearance he thought they were maybe larger sized coyotes,' he told Fox 32. 'The husband was trying to fight them off using a shovel. Self-defence: Police chief Peter Land tried pepper spray before shooting the dogs . 'The dogs are now literally circling the officer, showing their teeth, acting in a very aggressive manner. 'Our officers certainly didn't want to shoot two dogs but the situation they were presented with they really had no choice.' According to dogbreedinfo.com, Siberian Huskies are 'loving, gentle, playful, happy-go-lucky dogs' that are 'docile, social, relaxed and rather casual'. However, the site also noted that a 'lonely Husky, or a Husky that does not get enough mental and physical exercise can be very destructive' and 'likes to roam'. Schild told nwitimes.com she doesn't want her dogs' deaths to be in vain. 'I'm going to do everything in my power to try to get something changed so people become more aware of huskies,' she said.

But hundreds turned out yesterday to mark the passing of a former Royal Marine who died with no known family . . . or friends. Some travelled hundreds of miles to the funeral of James McConnell in Portsmouth after a local vicar used Facebook to appeal for mourners. Hero: Former Royal Marine James 'Jimmy' McConnell, of Southsea, Hampshire, died last month aged 70 . In remembrance: A motorcycle procession took place at the funeral of former Royal Marine James McConnell . Mark of respect: A small procession through the cemetery for Mr McConnell, who died of a chest infection, was led by Royal British Legion standard bearers . Reverend Bob Mason had felt troubled that just a handful of people would be at the ceremony – all of them care home staff who looked after Mr McConnell before his death aged 69 last month. He posted a message on Facebook  and contacted the Royal Marines  Association asking for help to give the former bus driver – known as Jimmy – a ‘better send-off’. After a rallying cry went around the Armed Forces and social networking sites his wish for the former serviceman was granted. Yesterday, in the biting cold, a procession through the cemetery was led by Royal British Legion standard bearers  followed by a group of flag-bearing motorcycles from the legion’s riders’ branch. Two buglers from the Royal Marines band played the Last Post as Mr McConnell’s coffin was lowered into the ground.And mourners surrounded the grave with poppy wreaths – one with the poignant, handwritten message: ‘Stand at ease, your work is done.’ Mr Mason, who conducted the service at Milton Cemetery, told the estimated 300 who attended: ‘The great majority of you who have come here today did not know James McConnell but wanted him to have a dignified farewell. ‘I thank you for that kindness and generosity of spirit.’ After the ceremony he said: ‘It was a very cold morning, and people were shivering, but it is testament to the sacrifice people were prepared to make in order to attend.’ Huge crowd: Staff at the ex-Marine's care home had feared they would be the only people at his funeral .

Richie Puttock, from the Royal Marines . Association, travelled 140 miles from his home in Cardiff to bid . farewell to the man he had never met. He said: ‘I had to ensure he got . the send-off he deserved. It was an absolutely fantastic service. I . think his story pricked the conscience of those who heard it, because . nobody wants to think they will have a funeral with nobody there. Wherever he is now, I’m sure he would have been pleased.’ 'The . great majority of you who have come here today did not know James . McConnell but wanted him to have a dignified farewell. I thank you for . that kindness' Reverend Bob Mason . Danny Marshall, a former Royal Marine, . said he attended because the corps was like an extended family. He . said: ‘It was mentioned wrongly that he did not have family; the corps . family is bigger and better than most people would know about. We are . all family and always will be.’ Mr McConnell, who died from a chest . infection, spent his final days at the Bluebell Care Home in Southsea. Little is known about his life or about his career in the Armed Forces. He was referred to the care home by . social services and arrived with his green beret, medals, and . photographs of the Falklands. Mr McConnell had been forced to leave his . flat, where he had lived alone, two months before his death after . suffering a stroke which affected his ability to speak.

They spent the day skimming stones on Plymouth Hoe before buying ice creams and sitting in a park. At one point, Lemon laughed as she planted her vanilla cone on Daley’s nose. It is thought Daley met 19-year-old Lemon, whose full name is not known, on the set of his ITV show Splash! earlier this year. Yesterday his spokesman said the pair are not dating. Dressed in knee-high leather boots, tiny denim shorts, cropped T-shirt and studded leather jacket, Lemon certainly stood out from the crowd. Daley opted for a far more conventional ensemble of jeans, T-shirt and trainers. But their contrasting dress-styles did not stop them having a good time. As they clambered over rocks to escape the rising tide, Lemon clung onto Daley’s arm for support. Later in the day, the pair drove off together in his car.

"By . James Tozer and Liz Hull . UPDATED: . 19:01 EST, 6 January 2012 . Detectives hunting the hospital insulin poisoner yesterday arrested a male nurse as it emerged that a fourth patient has died in suspicious circumstances. They arrested a 46-year-old, named by sources as Victorino Chua, at his Stockport home, before revealing that another death – that of 82-year-old Bill Dickson on New Year’s Eve – was also being investigated as part of the inquiry. The dramatic development came after staff at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, reported that a patient had been given the wrong medicine on Monday evening and his medical notes tampered with. The fourth patient to die after being poisoned with saline was former Manchester Evening News journalist Bill Dickson . The patient was unharmed but police were immediately contacted. Police sources last night stressed . that there was not yet any link between the arrest and the contamination . of saline drips at the hospital last summer. But it is understood the man worked on the same acute care wards at the . time the patients died and had previously been spoken to by officers as . part of their complex inquiry. Last night, the suspect remained in police custody and was being . questioned on suspicion of unlawfully administering or . causing a person to take a noxious substance, or poison. Today, a spokesman for Unison, the public sector trade union, confirmed Mr Chua is a member. Police stand guard outside Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport in July 2011, shortly after the alarm was raised . His arrest comes four months after nurse Rebecca Leighton, 27, who spent . six weeks in  jail accused of the poisonings, was released due to lack . of evidence. Police believe as many as 20 patients were deliberately poisoned when . saline solutions were injected with insulin on wards A1, A2 or A3 – . which care for seriously ill patients – between June 1 and July 15  last . year. 16 other patients are believed to have been poisoned at Stepping Hill hospital . Officers are continuing to probe the deaths of multiple sclerosis . sufferer Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, and . Mr Dickson, a former senior Daily Mail journalist, who all died after . suffering ‘hypoglycaemic episodes’ – a dangerous drop in blood sugar . levels. Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney, of Greater Manchester . Police, said: ‘This is, and always has been, a search for the truth. ‘It is due to the diligence of staff at the hospital that we were made . aware about the potential tampering of medical records and everyone . should be reassured that, like the hospital, we initiated a swift . response and have consequently arrested a member of staff in relation to . this matter. ‘I must stress that at this time he is only being spoken to in relation . to these matters and, as we have previously said, we will not and cannot . rule out making further arrests in the coming days or weeks.’ The man arrested was held after another nurse noticed that medical . records of a patient on Ward A3 had been altered overnight between . January 2 and 3. The patient was given medicine he should not have received but was . carefully monitored once the error was realised and later discharged. It was unclear last night whether the man arrested was the same male . nurse reportedly spoken to by officers last year when his fingerprints . were discovered on damaged packets of saline solution. Since the scandal broke in July extra security measures have been put in . place at the hospital, including CCTV in some treatment rooms, two . additional nurses assigned for the preparation and handling of drugs and . security guards on 24-hour watch outside the wards affected. The case against Rebecca Leighton was dropped after she was investigated over the deaths of three patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport . Chris Burke, chief executive of Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, which . runs the hospital, said he was ‘appalled by the malicious intent’ in the . latest incident. He added: ‘Thanks to the skill and experience of our . staff it was spotted and reported immediately, and most importantly we . ensured no patient suffered any ill-effects. ‘This criminal act does not reflect on the good care provided by . dedicated and committed staff and the effective working practices in our . hospital. The safety of our patients remains our highest priority.’ Police have been at pains to stress the complexity of the investigation . into the poisonings, which has seen them interview more than 650 people, . including doctors, nurses and pharmacy staff. Despite all criminal . charges being dropped against Miss Leighton, she was subsequently sacked . after she admitted stealing opiate-based drugs from the hospital. Mr Dickson was a former news editor at the Daily Mail. He joined in 1956 . and rose to become news editor of the North before leaving for the . Manchester Evening News in 1971. Mr Dickson retired from journalism in . 1991. His youngest son Drew, 42, also a journalist, remembered his . father as a ‘very funny’ man. He added: ‘None of his colleagues ever had . a bad word to say about him.’ Mr Dickson is survived by his wife, Jean, 80, their three children – Craig, 55, Kathy, 53 and Drew – and three grandchildren.

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 09:38 EST, 18 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:24 EST, 18 July 2013 . Washington state authorities are baffled after an investigation into the spike in a rare birth defect in several neighboring counties has failed to uncover a common cause. The counties of Yakima, Benton and Franklin all reported an unusually high rate of anencephalic pregnancies between January 2010 and January 2013. The Department of Health in conjunction with local health authorities and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention examined records to determine risk factors in the cases of anencaphaly but has not found a common cause. Rare: Anencephaly only affects one or two births per 10,000 in the U.S. Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus. This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp. Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer. The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. The rate in the Washington state counties is eight per 10,000 births. The condition: A baby born with anencephaly lacks the telencephalon, encompassing the part of the brain responsible for cognition . Baffled: Authorities are unsure why the Washington counties of Yakima, Benton and Franklin are reporting higher than average rates of anencephaly . It's a significant jump for such a rare condition and prompted the Department of Health study. According to the Department, . anencephaly and a related spinal cord disorder, spina bifida, can be . caused by a lack of the B-vitamin folic acid in the mother’s diet. Other . factors include certain medications, diabetes, pre-pregnancy obesity, . or previously having a child with a neural tube defect. Defect: Anencephaly occurs in the early weeks of pregnancy . In Washington, health investigators looked at family history, pre-pregnancy weight, health risk behaviors such as supplemental folic acid and medication use, and whether the  mother’s residence received drinking water from a public or private source. They found no common exposures, conditions or causes among the cases of anencephaly, and no significant differences between healthy pregnancies and anencephalic births. Health Department officials have said the higher rate of anencephaly could be pure coincidence. The Department will continue to monitor births in the region throughout 2013 to see if the rate of anencephaly remains raised, and whether any further causes can be identified. Dr. Joanne Stone, director of Maternal Fetal Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, told ABC that anencephaly can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 'The interesting thing with this study is that they looked at different factors, and women's histories, and obesity, and at medical history and couldn't find anything that stood out,' she said. 'Could it be a fluke? We don't know. It could take time to uncover some sort of [unusual] exposure.' According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, women of child-bearing age should take 400-1000 micrograms of folic acid daily, either from foods fortified with folic acid or a supplement.","Three Washington counties have reported an unusually high rate of anencephaly .

Henry Caplan raced down through the stands at Wimbledon’s Centre Court to hug the tennis star after what turned out to be one of the best days of each of their separate lives. But in that magic moment – captured on giant screens around the court and broadcast to the world – Britain’s feelgood barometer soared after a weekend during which the country, quite simply, went Olympics daft. Over here, Andy! Henry Caplan leans forward to Murray asking for a hug . Happy to oblige: The tennis star can't resist the youngster's demand and holds him in celebration . Kisses all round: This one's for girlfriend Kim Sears, who cheered him to victory over Federer . ...and this one's for the gold medal . For Murray, it was the moment he . turned a dream to reality and sensationally added an Olympic gold to . Britain’s astonishing medal tally. For . young Master Caplan, it was the opportunity of a lifetime to share in . the glory of one of his top sporting heroes during a peak of national . excitement over the Games. One . minute, he was sitting with his father in the dizzy heights of row Z.

Yesterday . as he waited for another glimpse of Murray and his other tennis hero, . Roger Federer, he told me: ‘I was just so happy. I had to let him know. I’m his biggest fan and I didn’t want to miss my chance.’ His father Elliot, a . 41-year-old furniture supplier from Blackmore, Essex, said: ‘I was . hugging him at the end of the match because he was overwhelmed and . crying with joy. He said “get off me” and slipped out of my arms. ‘Next thing I know, he’s all over the telly screens giving Andy Murray a hug.’ Jumping for joy, punching the air in triumph, Murray ran back on to the grass to celebrate his prize. Meanwhile he had made a fan for life. Henry, from Blackmore, Essex, told BBC Essex: 'As soon as Andy Murray won I was crying with joy and hugging my dad. 'I told my dad to get off and the next minute I was gone. I was down by the royal bit in front of Federer’s mum and dad. 'Then I hugged Andy Murray. I just thought I had to be there. It was cool.' Four . weeks on from the moment he left Centre Court in tears, the 25-year-old . champion-in-waiting had returned to take his revenge on arch rival . Federer – and to stride spectacularly into the record books.

Murray won Britain its first gold medal in the men’s singles for more than a century, since the 1908 London Games. Then he topped it up with silver . alongside national sweetheart Laura Robson in the mixed doubles. So it . wasn’t hard to understand why the famously grumpy Scot managed to raise . an ecstatic smile yesterday as he took a well-deserved share in this . most glorious weekend in British sport. He . even had a stab at mouthing the national anthem – and willingly draped . himself in a Union Flag after being presented with his first Olympic . gong. His victory was the . latest in a succession of triumphs to lift the country’s spirits in a . way that few anticipated before the start of the Games. For . just under two hours yesterday Murray was swept along on a wave of . British support that started with a rousing welcome to Centre Court, . possibly twice the decibel level of that raised for his Swiss adversary. Net gains: Murray looks to he heavens after beating Federer 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 . Jumping for joy: The celebrations begin for Andy Murray . If volume alone could have . won it for him, he would surely have finished in half that time. The . cheering was more like Wembley than Wimbledon, and there was no doubt it . helped to lift his game. ‘Come . on England!’ someone shouted, causing a ripple of laughter that tickled . even the Swiss. Another called out sarcastically: ‘We feel quite . strongly about you Andy.’ Despite . the ribaldry, however, few could have doubted they were cheering a . future Wimbledon champion. Yesterday Murray went in as the underdog and . emerged as the victor, and there’s nothing a British crowd likes better . than that. Afterwards he immediately paid tribute to the fans, declaring: ‘The support has been amazing. The crowd are unbelievable.’ From the start of the match it was clear that Murray was on a high. You . didn’t have to know anything about tennis to work that out. Watching . his fist keeping a log of his successes and mistakes was enough. He . held it at chest level and shook it like Spanish maracas when he missed . a shot; chin level, like a karaoke microphone, when he was pleased with . himself; and high in the air when he triumphed. Even . if you weren’t well placed to monitor that, there was always the . Judyometer. At the opposite end of the players’ box from his girlfriend . Kim Sears, his mother sat motionless during his botched shots, but . sprang to her feet to applaud his most spectacular moves. Ditto . Laura Robson, who spent much of the match sitting behind Mrs Murray, . showing not a trace of nervousness in the run up to the big moment that . would follow. British backing: There was plenty of home support on Wimbledon's Centre Court . Number one fan: Kim Sears watched on as Murray clinched the Olympic title at Wimbledon . Shot at the title: Murray went in as the underdog and . emerged as the victor against the man who beat him four weeks ago at Wimbledon . Comprehensive: Murray serves on his way to a resounding victory over Federer . Likewise, . Murray seemed unusually confident. Sometimes even relaxed. Just over 35 . minutes into the match, a return bounced tantalisingly on top of the net . before tumbling over to his advantage. Four weeks ago the fist might . have been punching the air to celebrate a vital extra point. Yesterday . he simply chuckled. Thirty . minutes later, Team Roger unfurled a Swiss flag and draped it over the . front of the players’ box. If it was meant to be a talisman it didn’t . quite do the trick. With Murray in this form, Federer needed much more . than luck on his side. Out . of sight of Centre Court, Murray Mount – formerly Henman Hill, formally . Aorangi Terrace – was heaving with spectators. Some sat gently steaming . in the sun that followed a huge downpour. How disappointed they must . have been to see pictures on the big screen showing small swathes of . empty seats. By the time . the scoreboard began to signal that Murray was looking unstoppable, Andy . pandemonium broke out in the stands. Medals at the double: Murray shows off his gold medal and the silver he won with partner Laura Robson . Murray and Robson were beaten by Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi of Belarus, while Lisa Raymond and Mike Bryan of the United States took bronze . It could never match the cheers of . 80,000 in that other stadium behind the clearly defined London skyline . in the distance, but it was like nothing most people have heard at the . All England club before. Then . came Henry. Mr Caplan paid just £260 for tickets for himself, Henry and . sons Alex, nine, and Jeremy, 19. ‘I think you could safely say it was . worth it,’ he said. Speaking . later about the hug, Murray told me: ‘I actually thought, because he . was in Roger Federer’s box and he asked me for a hug... I didn’t know . quite how to react. I thought maybe he was from Roger’s team.’ Was . he pleased to have made a big fan out of a small boy? ‘That’s one of . the reasons why the Olympics is so great,’ he said. ‘Everyone gets into . them.’ Murray became the . first British man to win the gold in singles since Josiah Ritchie in . 1908. As well as gold, Ritchie won silver in the men’s doubles and . bronze in the men’s indoor singles. His record stood untouched until . shortly after 4pm yesterday. But . as Murray waits over the next 11 months for another crack at the . Wimbledon title, he would do well not to be over confident. Ritchie lost . the singles final in 1909. But Murray has turned his sights towards winning his first Grand Slam tennis tournament at the US Open in three weeks’ time. The 25-year-old Scot said he hopes to be rested enough for success after coming so close at Wimbledon last month. 'I’ve felt close to Grand Slams before, and obviously this is the biggest title of my career,' he said. 'I’ve got the US Open in three weeks’ time, so I’ll have to get myself rested. 'I’m leaving for Toronto later today, there’s a tournament starts there. I play my first match on Wednesday. 'I’ve got three weeks to get myself ready for the US Open, and I hope that can be the first one.' Just missed out: Andy Murray took a second medal of the day in the mixed doubles with Laura Robson, but sadly he had to settle for silver .

McCue-Masone dared himself to run onto the field if his message was retweeted 1,000 times . Video provided by Prospect Productions . The entire challenge was played out on Twitter and McCue-Masone even posted texts from his mother begging him not to be so stupid. Shortly after 7pm, the teenager wrote '1000 RT's and ill run across the field...' When the figure reached 300 within an hour, he clearly began to get nervous. As the number of retweets continued to rise McCue-Masone wrote: 'This is gonna be terrible' before posting 'I hate all of you'. Once the target was reached, the full scale of his dare dawned on the teenager but he refused to back down. His mother begged her son, seen being bundled off field by security, fearing he would be arrested . The teenager's original message was retweeted more than 1,000 times .

In his final tweets before running onto the field, McCue-Masone wrote: 'blame it on social media, love you all' and then 'if i actually get on the field pray for me cause my moms gonna kill me.'

The father-of-three, who survived a bomb attack with 49 per cent burns during the conflict, was a picture of delight as his son James gained a degree in mechanical engineering from Cardiff University. The 51-year-old said it was particularly big honour for him because he left school without any qualifications to join the Army. Beaming with delight: War veteran Simon Weston celebrates with his son James after he graduated from Cardiff University . Achievement: James Weston, 21, has gained a degree in mechanical engineering from Cardiff University . An infantryman with the Welsh Guards, Simon Weston was only 20 when he suffered horrific burns in an Argentine bomb strike which killed 48 British servicemen and injured 150 in June 1982. In the line of duty: Weston, pictured in Northern Ireland back in 1979/80 - he went on to suffer horrific injuries in the Falklands War . His injuries were so severe his own mother did not recognise him at first and he endured years of reconstructive surgery and skin grafts, including 70 major operations. After the war he won praise for speaking publicly about his battles with post-traumatic stress disorder, which at times left him suicidal. Those dark days seemed far away as Mr Weston - dressed in his formal robes as an honorary fellow of the university - embraced his 21-year-old son at his graduation. He said: ‘It was a lovely day, I am a very proud father. ‘I left school without an A-level, an O-level or even a spirit level so it was a special day for me to see James collecting his degree. He worked very hard for it.’ James' achievement was all the more satisfying as he became an unexpected father mid-way through his studies. Simon admitted he was surprised when James said his girlfriend Almanita was pregnant. But in a column written for the Daily Mail last year, he said the arrival of Zachary in September 2011 had helped reunite his family. He said his other son Stuart had dropped out of school, but found a new incentive to make something of himself after becoming an uncle. There was another family celebration at Cardiff when Channel 4’s Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud received an honorary fellowship on the day his son Hugo was presented a Master’s degree in architecture.

Horror: Rhoda Youson was left unrecognisable after being attacked with a garden fork and a bat at her home in Nuneaton . A grandmother murdered in her own bed with a pitchfork and a wooden bat was beaten so savagely that her face 'caved in', a court heard. Rhoda Youson, 57, was found dead by police who forced their way into her blood-spattered flat in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. A trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard there was 'nothing left' of her face after the sickening attack, in which she suffered multiple fractures to her skull, jaw and cheekbones and damage to her hands, shoulder and neck. Homeless Anthony Hall, 47, denies Mrs Youson's murder. He was one of a number of homeless people that the 'generous' grandmother used to invite into her home and cook meals for, the court was told. The trial heard Hall set upon Mrs Youson, who lived alone in the flat, with a garden fork and a bat on November 22 last year. Philip Bennetts, prosecuting, said: 'The following day Hall told several people that he had done something bad. 'He . mentioned to a customer at a betting shop that he had killed someone . and told a friend that he had killed Rhoda and had caved her face in. 'She had massive injuries to her head and there was nothing left of her facial area. Blood was splattered on the walls.'

'Nothing left': Hall was one of a number of homeless people who 'generous' Mrs Youson would invite into her home and cook for . A garden fork was found in a car park near to the grandmother’s home alongside a carrier bag containing a broken wooden bat. Both items were later identified as belonging to Mrs Youson and had blood, tissue and hair samples on them. Trial: Mrs Youson suffered multiple fractures to her skull, jaw and cheekbones as well as damage to her neck, hands and shoulder . The QC told the court that Mrs Youson had two daughters and lived alone in sheltered housing in Blythe Court following her divorce. 'She drank heavily and became friendly with street drinkers,' he said . 'She was generous with money for homeless people she met. 'Hall was one of those people, who she used to invite to her home and cook them meals,' Mr Bennetts told the court. The trial continues.

Fresh evidence emerged last night revealing the extent to which blue chip companies uncovered personal details of individuals for more than a decade. Investigators were hired by insurance companies, finance firms and solicitors since 2001 to make ‘hundreds of thousands’ of bogus calls. A ‘blaggers’ manual’ has now been uncovered which was used to get hold of private information from institutions such as the NHS, the Royal Mail, Customs & Excise and Social Security. Worrying: Fresh evidence emerged last night revealing the extent to which blue chip companies used to uncover personal details of individuals from instiutions such as the Royal Mail . A Benefits Agency and Inland Revenue Data project (BAIRD) report has exposed the increasing black market in the trading of private data obtained illegally. Keith Vaz MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told the Independent: ‘This is extraordinary that there’s so much detail in this [blagging] document that will allow individuals to extract so much private information. ‘What is required now is that there should be full transparency into what these private investigators have been doing. ‘We need to make sure Soca and the Metropolitan Police should be able to follow the evidence wherever it leads... to uncover the truth about what has been happening. Speaking out: Keith Vaz MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, expressed his concern over the revelations . ‘More importantly, I think it’s necessary that those who have deliberately or unwittingly sought information about individuals or organisations should come clean and tell us precisely why they sought information and what they have done with it.’ The Baird Report listed the activities of a number of investigations agencies involved in blagging. One woman based in Wales, was raided by the ICO in 2000, and was found to be  ‘responsible for thousands of bogus calls’. The report said that much of their work was for the now defunct bank London Scottish, which was itself raided by the ICO in November 2000, several years before it collapsed in 2008. ‘They did a great deal of work for London Scottish and were also dropped like a hot potato as soon as London Scottish found out involvement of [ICO],’ said the report. The raid on London Scottish’s Manchester offices on 19 November 2000 ‘caused a great deal of consternation not only with them but within the financial industry as a whole,’ the report said. ‘While they claim they are giving every assistance they are in fact being deliberately obtuse, and using every legal delaying tactic in the book.’ The Baird report makes clear that the ICO was unhappy with London Scottish’s use of a network of tracing agents, including the companies Intersearch, V Chasers and Solent Credit, all of which were later prosecuted for unlawful activities. No prosecutions were brought against London Scottish.","Private details sought from the NHS, Royal Mail and Social Security .

Like any thoughtful citizen, Tracey Hayes always stops to pick up stray crisp packets and sweet wrappers in her local park without expecting any thanks. But when she paused to brush away some excess fur from her two dogs while she was walking there, the jobsworths pounced – and handed her a £50 fine for littering. Two council wardens told Mrs Hayes, 46, she had committed an offence after they spotted her brushing her golden retriever Biskit and German shepherd Rocky. Tracey Hayes brushed the coats of golden retriever Biskit and German shepherd Rocky in a Hornchurch park but was fined £50 by council wardens for littering . It was one of the hottest days of the year, and grooming her pets helped to cool them down. Mrs Hayes says she was then prevented . from clearing up the hair and claims the two officers drove off without . clearing it up themselves. The mother-of-two from Romford in . Essex said: ‘I spend so much time cleaning up litter in parks the fact . that I have now been given a fine is ironic – they never see you do any . good stuff. ‘I always leave the dogs’ hair out in my garden for the birds and I haven’t met a single person to say anything against it.’ Mrs Hayes, pictured with Rocky, said she always leaves dog hair out in her garden in Romford for the birds . The incident unfolded when Mrs Hayes was waiting for her son to finish football practice at Harrow Lodge Park, Hornchurch. She claims the park wardens pulled in . front of her car as she tried to leave. She says one ‘blocked’ her car . door to stop her getting out to clear up the hair as his colleague took a . photograph of the evidence. Mrs Hayes said: ‘I have owned dogs for over . ten years and have never heard of such a law. Paula Robson was fined by council wardens in County Durham for clearing up another dog's mess instead of her labrador Derik's - even though she cleaned that up too . Tracey Hayes is not the first victim of over-zealous council officials. Earlier this week it emerged a woman was fined £75 after she fed a piece of pastry from a pasty to a pigeon and then binned the packet in Bolton town centre. The council has since backed down over the fine. In 2009, Vanessa Kelly, 26, was fined £75 for feeding bread to ducks with her toddler in Smethwick, West Midlands. The year before, Sarah Davies was issued with a £75 fine for dropping a piece of sausage roll while feeding it to her young daughter. A  judge hearing her appeal in Hull later threw the case out. ‘I can’t deny it wasn’t a lot of hair, but it looked far worse when it was all spread out. ‘What has disappointed me most was he . was going to give me that fine no matter what – even though I offered . to clear it up.’ Mrs Hayes said the park officers then sped off without . binning the hair, which she put in her car to throw away at home. She . added: ‘Obviously this was all about the money and not cleaning up the . environment.’ Yesterday councillor Andrew Curtin of . Havering Council said: ‘Responsible dog owners groom their pets at home . or in their garden, not in public spaces, and especially not in our . parks. ‘We put a lot of time and effort into . keeping our parks clean.

Terrified drinkers dived for cover as Nure Bregu, 47, walked into the bar in the Italian village of Fontaniva, near Padua, and smashed up the machines in a fit of rage that is said to have lasted around 30 seconds. Once he had destroyed the machines, Bregu calmly walked out of the Bar Madonnina and gave a thumbs up to two onlookers before waiting for the police to arrive and arrest him. Scroll down for video . Armed: Bregu, right of the picture, is seen calmly walking into the bar carrying an axe . Calm before the storm: Pub regulars sit unaware that Nure Bregu, 47, seen at the left of the image, is about to take his frustration out on seven fruit machines with an axe . Anger: Bregu strikes the first fruit machine with the axe in a fit of rage . Aggressive: Bregu takes aim at another machine as drinkers start to realise what is happening behind them . Witnesses said that the father-of-two was a regular on the fruit machines and had spent several hours feeding coins into them and complaining that he had lost 5,000 Euros (£4,313). Bregu was sentenced to six years in jail for criminal damage, but walked free from court as prison sentences under two years are not enforced due to overcrowding. The Chinese owner of the bar, who declined to be named, said: 'He comes in here all the time to play the machines. He's had some wins but he spends a lot of money. 'He is a labourer and only works every now and then. 'He's normally a very quiet man. There has never been any problems with him in the past. 'He just walked in very calmly with an axe and smashed all the machines. There were several customers by them at the time and they were terrified. 'Luckily no-one was hurt but the machines are all broken. It's going to cost me to replace them and I will be losing customers as when people came in they would always order something from the bar.' Shock: Startled onlookers begin to move out of Bregu's way as he smashes each machine with a single blow . Run: Those in the pub jump up from their seats about to run away from Bregu who is wielding the axe . Captain Marco Stabile, of the local carabinieri police, said: 'It must have been a very frightening episode for those in the bar but he was very calm afterwards and arrested immediately by my officers. 'He said that he had lost 5,000 Euros on the machines and was so angry he just went home got the axe and decided to vent his frustration on them. 'Thanks to the CCTV and the fact he was arrested immediately red handed he was sent for immediate trial at the local court. Rage: Bregu takes aim at his final machine before he leaves the bar . Calm again: Bregu walked out of the bar and gave a thumbs up to two regulars before waiting for the police to arrive . 'He had been in the bar every day for the past fortnight the owner said and had spent several hours at the machines. He didn't threaten any of the customers or the owner but just decided to attack the slot machine.' The incident came just days after a local mayor had asked bar owners to switch off machines for 24 hours to combat the country's growing gambling addiction. Slot machine addiction is a growing social phenomenon in Italy with arcades springing up all across the country as hard up Italians try and stretch their wages through gambling and several regional medical authorities have reported a rise in treating those hooked. Earlier this year an Italian businessman was taken to hospital after worried bar owners in Bergamo called paramedics after he spent more than 12 hours on a machine pumping in more than £19,000.","Nure Bregu smashed up the machines at a bar near Padua in northern Italy .

Jailed: Jonathon Mills, 46, has been sentenced to five years in prison for fraudulently billing an elderly woman for building work . A cowboy builder has been jailed for five years after conning an elderly woman out of her entire £120,000 savings. Jonathon Mills, 46, from Heathfield Newton Abbot, Devon, befriended the victim after she contacted him having seen his advert in a local publication. Over the next two years he then issued her with forty invoices totalling charges of £119,722.14. The victim's family finally contacted authorities after they discovered all the money in the victim's bank account had gone. An expert building surveyor told Exeter Crown Court that the work was only worth . around £24,000, if all that Mills charged for had been completed. The surveyor also identified that some invoices showed work had been charged for twice on a number of different occasions. Evidence showed one of the most . outrageous examples was for a shed for which Mills charged more than £3,500 to build a small two sided outhouse in her . garden. Acting as an expert witness for the prosecution, the surveyor stated: 'In many invoices parts of the . building were supposedly opened again and quite often to apparently deal . with very slightly different issues, yet I find it impossible to . believe that the need for later rectification work was not actually . picked up and done at the earlier time. This is a recurring theme in the . invoices.' Conman: Mills charged the elderly woman £3,500 to build this simple garden shed . Mills, who was jailed for similar offences in 2001, also carried out gas work . for her even though he was not Gas Safe registered, which is a legal . safety requirement. He was sentenced to five years in prison, the maximum penalty for the offences committed after pleading guilty to unfair trading and fraud offences following an investigation by Devon and Somerset Trading Standards Service. Steve Gardiner, Special Investigations Unit Manger for Devon and Somerset Trading Standards Service, said: 'The level of dishonesty and the appalling abuse of trust involved in this case is truly shocking, so it is excellent news that our Trading Standards Team have successfully worked with Devon and Cornwall Police and the Regional Scambusters team in order to bring Mr Mills to justice. 'Mr Mills is a skilled conman and an accomplished liar who deliberately targeted a vulnerable widow, befriending her and gaining her trust. 'He then took advantage of that friendship for his own gains until her money ran out.' Devon County Council launched the investigation, supported by Devon and Cornwall Police and the Regional Trading Standards Scambuster Team, following concerns raised by the victim’s family when they discovered that all the money from her bank account had gone.","Jonathon Mills, 46, from Devon, billed victim with forty invoices .

A British man who moved to Australia to start a new life has been missing for five days in bitterly cold mountains. Berkshire-born Gary Tweddle, 23, was attending a technology conference in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, when he vanished in the early hours of Tuesday. His father David Tweddle, an Army officer, has flown to Australia to join the lines of police and emergency service workers scouring the dense bushland, where there are a number of dangerous cliffs. Missing: Gary Tweddle, 23, has been missing for five days in Sydney's bitterly cold Blue Mountains . Police said they feared the missing man could be lying injured in harsh conditions, as darkness began to fall on the fifth day of the search effort. Mr Tweddle called a friend shortly after midnight on Tuesday and told them he was lost in bushland near a main road after becoming separated from a group. Nothing was heard from him after that, . suggesting that he was out of range of a mobile signal or that his phone's . battery had run flat. Mr Tweddle, described as being 'extremely fit', appeared to be in good spirits when he made the phone call. 'He's not dressed for these conditions so we need to find him quickly,' police commander Mick Bostock said. His father has been putting up posters in small towns in the mountains appealing for help in trying to locate his son. 'It's been several days now and obviously there is concern,' said David Tweddle. 'We're all praying for his safe return.' Disappearance: Mr Tweddle, seen left and right meeting Wales and Lions rugby star Jamie Roberts, was attending a technology conference in the Blue Mountains when he vanished . Bad weather was setting in today, adding to fears for the missing man's well-being. Search effort: Berkshire-born Mr Tweddle moved to Australia to start a new life . Police bushland experts along with members of the Rural Fire Service and the State Emergency Service have been searching the dense forests - where there are dangerously steep cliffs - since first light on Tuesday but there has been no sign of the young man. Friends said that after growing up in Britain, Mr Tweddle moved to Queensland's Gold Coast before moving again to live in Sydney. His girlfriend, Anika Haigh, has been waiting anxiously at a police command post in the mountains along with Gary's father as the search for the young man continued today. 'We're absolute desperate to bring him home to his very loved family and friends,' Miss Haigh told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation earlier. The search teams, made up of 75 officers and volunteers, have been scouring bushland around the small town of Leura, risking their own lives among the cliffs and gullies. Mr Tweddle's family and friends have taken to Facebook to appeal for any information. 'Keep up the prayers that our little Gary is just having a bit of an adventure and is safe and well,' his sister Amy wrote on Facebook. His brother Craig wrote: 'Stay safe, don't panic. USE YOUR SKILLS'. Gary, who is 5ft6ins, is of medium build, with brown eyes and short brown hair. When last seen he was wearing a black jacket, checked shirt and blue jeans. In July, 2009 - almost four years ago to the day - British backpacker Jamie Neale was found alive after going missing in the Blue Mountains for 12 days. Aside from the four year separation, only a day's difference stands between Mr Neale's discovery on July 15 and the early hours of July 16 when Mr Tweddle went missing.","Gary Tweddle, 23, missing in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney .

Once named the most eligible girl in Britain by society bible Tatler, Lady Kitty Spencer's bachelorette days appear to be over, after going public with a new romance during a dinner at Lord's. And the lucky man isn't just any old beau: he's Nick Compton, England cricket star, and heir to a dynasty almost as exceptional as Kitty's own. Although this is the first time they have been seen together, the duo have been exchanging flirty Twitter messages since last September, with her teasing him for his obsession with his hair and laughingly calling him 'grandad' - a nod to the seven year age gap between them. Happy couple: Kitty Spencer and boyfriend Nick Compton have kept their romance under wraps until now . Public: The pair appeared happy and in love when they appeared at a cricketing awards dinner at Lord's . The niece of Diana, Princess of Wales, 22-year-old Kitty is the eldest daughter of Charles, Earl Spencer, from his first marriage to Victoria Lockwood. She numbers Princes William and Harry among her cousins and is a close friend of Prince Harry's former girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. Compton, meanwhile, is the grandson of Denis Compton, who played 78 times for England, and landed an FA Cup winner's medal with Arsenal in 1950. One of England's top batsmen, Compton was named Cricketer of the Year by the Wisden Almanac - the cricket equivalent of Tatler - this year. Family matters: Kitty with her father, Earl Spencer, and Nick Compton's sporting grandfather, Denis . Kitty, who was on hand to see him win, gave him a huge hug as he went up to receive the award in recognition of a year in which he was England's leading run-scorer. While Compton has been concentrating on his sporting career, Kitty has been studying for an MA in luxury brand management in London, and travelling back and forth to South Africa to visit her mother, who still lives in Cape Town. Although Compton isn't quite as well bred as his new girlfriend, the pair do at least have South Africa in common: he was born there and remained in the country until he won a scholarship to Harrow.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:58 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:58 EST, 9 July 2013 . Low level exposure to traffic fumes is enough to raise the risk of lung cancer, scientists reported yesterday. Air pollution may even have to be added to smoking as a recognised cause of the disease, it is claimed. Lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer in the UK, claiming almost 35,000 lives in 2010. In the same year, 42,000 Britons were diagnosed with the disease. Danger: New research suggests even low exposure to car fumes could increase the risk of lung cancer . An estimated 86% of cases are believed to be a direct result of smoking. Other potential triggers include exposure to natural radioactive gas from the ground and toxic substances in the work place, such as asbestos. The new research, reported in the journal The Lancet Oncology, analysed pooled information from 17 studies in nine European countries. In total, the data covered almost 313,000 individuals. Air pollution levels were estimated at people’s home addresses and cancer diagnosis rates obtained from national and local registries. Over an average 13 year follow-up period, 2,095 study participants developed lung cancer. People’s chances of having the disease rose with greater exposure to small sooty particles generated by diesel exhausts which are known to lodge in the lungs. Two size grades of particle were studied, tiny PM 2.5s and somewhat larger PM10s. For every density increase in PM10s of 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air, the risk of lung cancer rose by 22%. For PM2.5s, every five microgram per metre cubed increase led to an 18% increase in risk. Deadly: An estimated 86 per cent of lung cancer cases are thought to be caused by smoking . The trend was seen below the air quality limits set by the European Union of 40 micrograms per cubic metre for PM10s and 25 micrograms for PM2.5s, according to the study authors. Lead scientists Dr Ole Raaschou-Nielsen, from the Danish Cancer Society Research Centre, said: 'We found no threshold below which there was no risk. The results showed a picture that ‘the more the worse, the less the better’.' Traffic pollution was mostly linked to adenocarcinoma lung cancer, the only form of the disease to affect significant numbers of non-smokers. Commenting in the journal, Japanese expert Dr Takashi Yorifuji from Okayama University wrote: 'At this stage, we might have to add air pollution, even at current concentrations, to the list of causes of lung cancer and recognise that air pollution has large effects on public health.' A second study published in a sister journal, The Lancet, links air pollution with a higher chance of heart failure patients being hospitalised. Researchers combined data from 35 studies and estimated that a modest reduction in fine particulate pollution levels could prevent 8,000 heart failure hospitalisations each year in the US. Dr Anoop Shah, from the University of Edinburgh, who co-led the British Heart Foundation-funded study said: 'We already know that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of having a heart attack. Our study suggests that air pollution also affects patients with heart failure.' Heart failure occurs when the heart is too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body. It affects more than 750,000 people in the UK.","Even low level exposure can increase risk of illness .

Royal baby fever may have gripped much of Britain and indeed the rest of the world, but as one American interviewer found out, not everyone is in a frenzy of anticipation. When CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour asked Margaret Rhodes, the Queen's first cousin and close friend, if she was excited about the baby, her answer took the journalist by surprise. 'Not terribly,' admitted the 88-year-old, hooting with laughter. Scroll down for video . British sangfroid: The Queen's first cousin, 88-year-old Margaret Rhodes, says she is 'not terribly' excited about the impending birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby . 'Heir to the throne? History?' An incredulous Christiane Amanpour reacts to Mrs Rhodes' confession . Why on earth not? asked the incredulous Amanpour. Mrs Rhodes, who grew up with the Queen . and was present at the Queen Mother's deathbed in 2002, sighed: 'Well . you know, everybody has babies.  And it's lovely.  But I don't get . wildly excited about it.' 'Heir to the throne?' prompted Amanpour. 'History?' Eventually, possibly more to move on to more interesting topics than anything else, Mrs Rhodes conceded: 'Yes, all right. I'm prepared to be excited.' The US TV host  asked Mrs Rhodes, the youngest daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone and his wife Mary Bowes-Lyon, sister of the Queen Mother, what sort of life the baby, which will be third in line to the throne, would have. Mrs Rhodes said she hoped it would have 'just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's . life', something she said the Royal Family managed with the then Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She added: 'The king and queen in those days made an . enormous effort to give -- to keep their childhood sort of sacrosanct. I . mean, it was just a time for learning and enjoying. 'And I think that . they have succeeded awfully well.' Watch the CNN interview in full here . Mrs Rhodes, who lived at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace during World War Two, while she worked for MI6, went on to staunchly defend the Queen over criticism about the way she reacted to Princess Diana's death in 1997, staying up in Balmoral rather than returning to the capital. She said: 'I think it was an eminently sensible decision personally because what was the point -- we've got two grieving children with you, William and Harry, whose mother's just died unexpectedly. 'And to go to London and sit in Buckingham Palace with nothing to do, nothing to do except sit and think about your mother or look out of the window at the crowds, I mean, what help was that for the boys?' Asked by the interviewer whether she talked to the monarch about the aftermath, mother-of-four Mrs Rhodes said: 'No. No. And I've . never talked to her about it. I mean there are some things that one sort . of keeps off, really. Expectant parents: Mrs Rhodes says she hopes the new baby will have a 'jolly, happy, ordinary' childhood . Margaret Elphinstone married the writer Denys Gravenor Rhodes in 1950 - Princess Margaret was bridesmaid . Mrs Rhodes, who lives in the Garden House in Windsor Great Park, given to her by the Queen 32 years ago, said the Queen often comes to have a drink with her after attending the chapel in the park. She said: 'She quite often does. She comes in after prayers for . half an hour and just has a nice little drink and a chat. She also described how her cousin fell in love with her 'incredibly good-looking' future husband when she was just 13 and he 17, saying: 'I think that in the way 13-year olds do, she fell in love with a very, very handsome young man.' Mrs Rhodes was a bridesmaid at their wedding in 1947, three years before her own wedding. Mrs Rhodes admits that when she heard her aunt and uncle were to become the Queen and King of England, her reaction could have been more sophisticated. She said: 'I can remember to this day that I . shamingly hopped around the dance floor, saying, ""My uncle's now king,"" which was a very shaming thing to do, but I did it.' Margaret Elphinstone with her future husband Denys Rhodes - they went on to have four children . After the death of her husband, Denys Rhodes, Mrs Rhodes became a Woman of the Bedchamber to her aunt, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, a position she held until the latter's death. She told Amanpour how she wept when watching the film, The King’s Speech, about her uncle, King George VI. She said: 'I cried in the film, it was so well done. And I think it did show the difficulties he surmounted. And there was one moment where he was making the king say a whole lot of frightfully rude words... 'And I did say something to the Queen about that, and she said she'd never heard her father use bad language at all. So whether that was true or not, I don't know.' Row upon row of ladders mark each photographer's pitch outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's, Paddington, where the royal baby will be born . Counting down: Mother-of-four Mrs Rhodes says she is 'not terribly' excited as 'everybody has babies' Journalists are cursing the hot sun as they wait in soaring temperatures outside the hospital in the press pen . Mrs Rhodes, whose autobiography The Final Curtsey tells how she had to ensure the Queen Mother never ran out of gin and Dubonnet, champagne or chocolate eclairs, had some words of approbation for the Duchess of Cambridge, saying 'She's doing very, very well.' She added: 'I think she's got a way with her . that's going to be very appealing. And I think that she won't sort of . vie for coverage with... which Diana perhaps did a little bit.' After a fortnight spent waiting in the press pen outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, journalists are running out of ways to kill the time. They grabbed their spot and marked it up two weeks ago, and now there is little to do but wait in the sunshine. One US news anchor, NBC's Natalie Morales, has taken to knitting to pass the time outside the private Lindo wing where the Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth. Morales, 41, a mother of two boys who in her spare time competes in triathlons, is knitting a pair of pale blue bootees for the baby. If she has to wait much longer, she can knit a pink pair as well.

The advert was placed on July 16 with the provocative title of ‘Sugar baby for my son’ and the mom goes on to explain that she is looking for a young woman, under 19 years old, willing to turn her boy into a man. There is no proof that the plea is real, however. The upfront mom - who doesn't give her name or say what her son is called - explains that her 18-year-old son is a senior in High School and will be going away to Harvard in the fall. A scheming mom has posted an ad on Craigslist looking for a young woman to help turn her Harvard-bound son from a wallflower into a stud before his heads off to college later this year (stock images) Although he is ‘extremely smart,’ his mom is concerned that he has ‘never had a girlfriend’ and is probably a virgin. Her offer which is open to any Philly-based woman aged 19 or younger is simple – ‘I want to find a cute young girl to date him and turn him from high school nerd to cool college kid,’ she explains. She describes her boy as ‘very handsome and extremely fit,’ as well as being on the varsity cross country team, she claims he has almost zero body fat.

The calculating mom is willing to buy four tickets to a concert and then given two to her son and two to the chosen vixen. ‘He'll go to the show with one of his buddies (no way he'll take a girl, he's to (sic) shy to ask them out) and you and your friend will be in the seats next to them,’ she writes. Then the chosen girl will ‘spring into action’, start talking to her boy during the concert and will ‘eventually pick him up.’ The conniving mom has a very clear idea of how this first date should end. ‘Ask him to take you somewhere after and ditch your friends. Then you seduce him and take his virginity,’ she writes. The bizarre request was posted on July 16 in the 'casual encounters' section of Craigslist in Philadelphia . And it doesn’t end there, the future monster-in-law anticipates the fake relationship lasting beyond one night. She write that she wants the chosen girl to keep dating him and ‘showing him different sex positions’ until he goes to college. At that stage the scheming mom wants the women to gently let her boy go ‘so he'll have the confidence to date other girls once he's there.’ What a proposal, and in return the mom promises she’ll make the chosen girl’s ‘financial issues disappear’ and suggests the lucky girl may even get the car of her choice. ‘Please put your favorite type of car in the subject, to show that you're real,’ she writes.

The Washington, DC home where German-born socialite Viola Drath was brutally killed at 91 is now for sale. Drath’s heirs placed the three-bedroom townhouse in posh Georgetown on the market for the bargain price of $995,000. But since Drath’s own husband, the much younger Albrecht Muth, is accused of strangling and beating her to death in the bathroom at 3206 Q Street, they may still be asking too much. Georgetown chic: The home at 3206 Q Street in Washington, DC was the site of the brutal murder of a 91-year-old German-born socialite . Accused: Seen here sporting a fake Iraqi military uniform, Albrecht Muth is accused of beating his 91-year-old wife Viola Drath (left) to death in the home in 2011 . According to the Washingtonian, an adjoining townhouse in the sought after neighborhood recently sold for half a million more. However, the 2011 crime received extensive media coverage thanks to the late journalist’s name recognition and her younger husband’s reputation for bizarre behaviour, which likely dealt a blow to the home’s value. Curbed reports that the once drab residence has been completely renovated, including the bathroom where the crime took place. Don’t look for it in real estate photos, though. The sellers didn’t bother to include the room in a series of shots taken inside the 1,770 square foot row house. Revamped: Since Drath's gruesome murder, the home has since been fully remodeled . The sun-drenched photos convey luxury . and style, with two fireplaces and a bay window in the living room and . hardwood floors running throughout the home. Years of media reports have made it the unlikely backdrop for some strange and gruesome events. Albrecht . Gero Muth, who was 44 years his wife’s junior, was seized by police in . August 2011 after details emerged about their violent marriage. Viola . Drath obtained a string of orders against Muth during their marriage . after he once allegedly attacked her with a chair and held her captive . in her own house. Personal touches: Hardwood floors run throughout the 1770 square foot home, which has played host to elite Washington society in addition to playing backdrop to a heinous crime . Easy to forget: Once described as drab, the home that has seen the likes of Dick Cheney and Antonin Scalia is now warm and modern despite its chilling history . The built-in bookcases add a classic touch to the three-bedroom Georgetown rowhouse . Muth is also said to have sat on her during the disturbing incident in which he 'pounded her head into the floor' several times. The sellers would likely prefer potential buyers to focus on the impeccably maintained home’s history of playing host to DC power players, though. Muth and Drath hosted many honoured guests in their home over the course of their marriage, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Heart of it all: The sunny master bedroom. Nearby are the dining, shopping, and nightlife of historic Georgetown . Stylish: A dining area gleams in the 1770 square foot home. Not pictured are the home's 2.5 baths. Not surprising since the murder occurred in an upstairs bathroom . The living room with its two fireplaces and bay windows. Well worth the $995,000, since an adjoining rowhouse recently sold for half a million more . But the accused killer’s strange behaviour has gotten him much more press than his dinner guests. Muth, who married Drath when he was in his 20s and she her 70s, claims to be a brigadier general with the Iraqi army and prior to his life awaiting trial behind bars he was often seen sporting a makeshift Iraqi military uniform. This, despite his having been born in Germany. He has even asked for the right to wear his military uniform at trial, long delayed because of antics on Muth’s part, though the Iraqi Embassy says he has no connection to the government or the military. Great for kids: In back are a terrace and large garden . Room to grow: The home features a master bedroom and two smaller guests bedrooms . Sunny: The guestrooms have seen many a high-ranking official come and go . Thanks to prospective buyers, Drath’s murder occurred in the upstairs bathroom, which leaves 1.5 others to use in the 2.5 bath home. And there were interested parties at a recent walk-through, reports the Washingtonian. Offers for the centrally located home were due July 16. Muth’s long-delayed trial is scheduled to finally take place in December. Though Muth tried to forge documents in order to claim hundreds of thousands from his wife's estate, Drath's will was changed to exclude him before she died . Day in court: After multiple delays due to his poor mental health, Muth will finally stand trial for his wife's death in December .","Viola Drath was strangled and beaten to death in the posh Georgetown home and her much younger husband Albrecht Muth is accused of the crime .

Details of how Myra Hindley was allowed to conduct a three-year lesbian affair with a prison warder have been revealed for the first time. The Moors Murderer’s relationship with former nun Pat Cairns was common knowledge among staff at Holloway, files reveal. The pair’s romance began during table tennis sessions and the child killer even knitted cuddly toys as presents for her lover. Lovers: Myra Hindley, pictured left in prison in 1985, and former nun Pat Cairns in 2007, right, conducted an affair while Hindley was in prison at Holloway where Cairns was a warder . But Hindley managed to convince the prison governor that tales of an affair were false and Cairns merely provided ‘spiritual guidance’. When a fellow inmate reported them, Hindley convinced the governor it was a lie and the other prisoner was punished for making false allegations. The relationship continued until a plot by the pair to spring Hindley from jail and escape together to South America was uncovered. The warder who exposed their scheme, Heather Longhurst, told police: ‘It was general gossip that there had been association between Patricia Cairns and Myra Hindley.’ Hindley had been found in the prison chapel and escorted back to her wing by Miss Longhurst. Another officer searched the chapel and found Cairns in a ‘very flustered’ state. Later Cairns confessed to Miss Longhurst how she had met Hindley playing table tennis on the wing and the pair, both then 27, had fallen in love. The previously secret files have been studied by Dr Tom Clark, a Sheffield University lecturer who is researching a book about Hindley. Infamous mugshots: Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, known as the Moors Murderers . They reveal how Cairns and the killer had trysts in the prison chapel and exchanged more than 100 letters – with the warder posing as Hindley’s cousin. Between 1971 and 1973 Hindley wrote 74 letters to Cairns, addressing them to ‘Glenis Moores’ – she had a cousin Glenys. The murderer received 51 typewritten replies from Cairns, which were later destroyed. Miss Longhurst said: ‘Cairns told me she loved Hindley more than anything else in the world. They seemed to have a perfect understanding in every way. ‘Pat showed me knitted articles in the form of animals which Myra had made for her.’ Cairns even showed her photographs she had taken of Hindley in her cell. The affair was able to continue, not least because the governor, Dorothy Wing, had a high opinion of Hindley and even took her for walks on Hampstead Heath. In March 1971, inmate Pat Ali was caught with a £5 note hidden inside a pen. She claimed it was a reward for acting as a go-between for Cairns and Hindley. Crime scene: Saddleworth Moor near Manchester where the Moors murderers Myra Hindley and Ian Brady buried their victims . Hindley said these were ‘mendacious and wicked allegations’ and that Cairns had provided her with ‘considerable spiritual help’ when she asked advice about a ‘particularly painful religious struggle’. Ali was found guilty of making a false malicious allegation against a prison officer. Governor Wing even wrote about Hindley: ‘As a prisoner she presents herself as a very disciplined, very controlled person anxious never to transgress prison rules.’ But in November 1973 police heard rumours of a plot by Hindley to escape using forged keys. Hindley became desperate to warn her lover and when Miss Longhurst heard talk of ‘key impressions’ she arranged to see Cairns. Suspecting prison keys had been copied in a serious escape bid, she decided to turn her colleague in. Grief: Mrs Ann West, mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, at Cookham Wood prison where Myra Hindley died . Cairns was jailed for six years and never saw Hindley again. Hindley continued to write to her until 1976. Her letters were returned unread. Hindley, who with Ian Brady tortured and murdered at least five children in Manchester in the 1960s, burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor, died in Cookham Wood prison in 2002, aged 60. Her prison records were originally intended to be sealed for 100 years, but were released into the national archives after her death. Cairns assumed a new identity on release from prison and moved to a spot near the moors, close to where Hindley’s ashes were scattered.","Moors Murderer Myra Hindley had trysts in prison with female warder .

It is common in politics for the gloves to come off – but normally during bruising encounters in the Commons. For the Deputy Prime Minister, it is the shoes and socks that come off. Nick Clegg has taken a decidedly lax approach to office attire as the country sizzles in a summer heatwave and has started walking around his office barefoot. The Lib Dem leader gave a glimpse into his working habits yesterday, while pointing out that he respects the ‘dignity’ of his ministerial staff by always wearing footwear for public events. He told listeners on London’s LBC radio: ‘I was padding around in my office without my shoes on yesterday, but obviously in public events when I have to respect the dignity of the office I put my shoes back on.’ Mr Clegg, 46, said he also allows staff to cool off by wearing shorts – as long as they are ‘not in public facing jobs where they have to keep up appearances’. Teo van den Broeke, of men’s magazine Esquire, said of Mr Clegg’s barefoot style: ‘I think it’s incredibly poor etiquette and sets too lax a tone.’ Broeke advised wearing thinner soles and more breathable shoes as a way to beat the heat, but never flip-flops. Mr Clegg went on to divulge how his laid-back approach to work clothes also extending to staff being allowed to wear shorts. He said: ‘I am perfectly relaxed about people who work in my office, as . long as they are not in public facing jobs where they have to keep up . appearances, if they are in the office working hard I’m very keen that . they shouldn’t overheat.’ Weather alerts: The Met Office this morning issued a level three alert (represented by the colour orange) for the second day running - while the areas highlighted in yellow have been issued a level two warning and the areas in green a level one alert . Footwear: When holidaying in Spain with wife Miriam, Mr Clegg prefers to wear sandals . The Met Office this morning issued a . 'level three' heatwave warning for London and the South East for the . second day running but also added the South West England and the West . Midlands regions on to the high alert list. Temperatures reached highs of 30.5C . by the Solent in Hampshire by 1pm today with forecasters warning it . could get even hotter by the end of the day. A group of Labour MPs have tabled a . parliamentary motion saying that workers should be allowed to down tools . when the temperature hits 30C (86F) or 27C (81F) if they do strenuous . work. On Wednesday a group of Labour MPs tabled an Early Day Motion in the . Commons that called for workers to be sent home when the temperature . reaches 30C indoors. But Mr Clegg said: ‘I don’t think we should suddenly be passing laws and issuing great rules for everybody. Mr Clegg said commuters faced ‘brutal’ temperatures on public transport, but did not think the law needed to be changed. ‘I just think you’ve got to be pragmatic, if you’re in an office which doesn’t have air conditioning and the sun is coming in, particularly these offices under roofs which can overheat, I just think you’ve got to be sensible. ‘You cannot, I don’t think, reasonably expect someone to actually sit in an office if it’s 35 degrees, you can’t get work done like that.’ The prospect of Mr Clegg tip-toing around his office in his socks drew immediate comparisons with former Tory policy guru Steve Hilton. He left Downing Street staff baffled by his appearance, rarely wearing shoes, but often sporting shorts and a Big Society t-shirt.","Deputy Prime Minister says he has 'dignity' to wear shoes for public events .

Millions of pounds in benefits are to be offered to communities to persuade people to agree to new nuclear power stations being built near their homes. Towns and villages near eight sites in England and Wales will be offered up to £1,000 for every megawatt hour of electricity generated for 40 years. It means people living near Hinkley Point in Somerset are in line for £128million if a new nuclear generator goes ahead. Cash: Communities near new nuclear power stations will receive millions in bribes, including Hinkley Point in Somerset (pictured) which is in line for £128million . Energy minister Michael Fallon insisted it is ‘absolutely essential’ to recognise the contribution towns and villages make to national energy security by having a reactor built nearby. Under the package, councils would benefit for up to the first 10 years of operation of a nuclear power plant from a share of the increased business rates revenues that will be generated. Then during the second phase of the programme there would be annual taxpayer-funded payments between 2030 and 2060 from the Department of Energy and Climate Change to communities hosting nuclear power plants. Mr Fallon said: ‘New nuclear will have a central role to play in our energy strategy, providing heat and light to homes across the country. Energy minister Michael Fallon said the funding was 'absolutely essential' ‘It is absolutely essential that we recognise the contributions of those communities that host major new energy projects. ‘This package is in the interests of local people, who will manage it to ensure long-term meaningful benefit to the community. ‘It's proportionate to the scale and lifespan of new nuclear power stations and it builds on the major economic benefits they will bring in terms of jobs, investment and use of local services.’ Community benefits packages have been announced for other controversial energy infrastructure, including onshore wind farms and ‘fracking’ for shale gas, but in those cases the developer will pay for them. David Hall, a county councillor in Somerset, welcome the funds for the area near Hinkley Point. He added: ‘The money is a tremendous asset to our county and will help create jobs and apprenticeships, provide essential improvements like affordable housing and regenerate areas that could really do with financial help. Construction of the first of a planned new generation of nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point has stalled as EDF and officials have so far failed to agree a price for the electricity which will be generated from the Hinkley Point site. But Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: ‘Whilst wind farms and even shale gas developers have to pay community benefits, only nuclear stations will get a fat taxpayer subsidy to fund them. ‘Our entire energy policy is now absurdly distorted by the desperation to prop up EDF's faltering Hinkley C project, with the Government piling the costs on to the taxpayer to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they backed the wrong technology. We can't go on like this.’","Cash on offer for eight sites in England and Wales to agree to new reactors .

Mark Lancaster (above), 40, preyed on the vulnerable women by setting up scam website Sponsor A Scholar in the hope of seeking out 'cheap sex' and fulfilling his 'sordid fantasies' A ‘creepy’ computer geek who posed as an academic to dupe needy students into having sex with him on camera in exchange for bogus £15,000 scholarships has today been jailed for 16 months. Mark Lancaster, 40, preyed on the vulnerable women by setting up scam website Sponsor A Scholar in the hope of seeking out ‘cheap sex’ and fulfilling his ‘sordid fantasies’. The explicit website offered to put students in touch with potential ‘sponsors’ who would pay their tuition fees in exchange for sex. Girls were told they would be rewarded with higher sums of money if they undertook ‘more unusual’ sex acts, Southwark Crown Court heard. Lancaster gained their trust by pretending to be a respected academic before luring them to ‘interviews’ at a private rented apartment in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. During one ‘practical assessment’ last September, an 18-year-girl was provided with a schoolgirl outfit and high heels before Lancaster asked her to pose for photographs, telling her: ‘The golden rule is the sexier you look in the pictures, the bigger scholarship amount you can get.’ The teenager, who is now 19, said she felt ‘no option’ but to have sex with Lancaster, filmed by secret cameras hidden in the ceiling and corners of his bedroom and bathroom. The Kenyan national went through with sex with him to avoid burdening her single mother with the cost of her studies, describing how she felt ‘gross’ afterwards. But she was later told by Lancaster that she had failed the assessment but had another opportunity to ‘try again’. Lancaster was working as a computer contractor for the Foreign Commonwealth Office at the time of the offences and in the past has been employed by IBM, Fujitsu and the Ministry of Defence. Lancaster gained students' trust by pretending to be a respected academic before luring them to 'interviews' at a private rented apartment in Milton Keynes, Bucks . The pervert was exposed following undercover investigations by Channel Four News and the Independent newspaper. ‘He was accomplished in the use of computers and computer technology and set up a website called Sponsor A Scholar, the purpose of which was targeting vulnerable female students seeking funding for their education, principally at university level,’ said prosecutor Lisa Wilding. ‘The defendant would be the assessor and they (girls) would be required to have sex with him so he could determine whether they were suitable for a sponsor. ‘There were no sponsors and no scholarships and the entire elaborate plan was concocted by this defendant purely for his own sexual gratification. ‘Thanks must be offered to the journalists because it was through investigative journalism that the defendant was revealed and his activities and the website were brought to an end.’ Judge Peter Testar described Lancaster’s activities as a 'pitiless deception'. ‘For the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification, you set up a complex scam. What was involved was offering to put needy young women in touch with so called sponsors who would pay them up to £15,000 a year. ‘It’s plain, as the complainant acknowledged, that what was expected of the young women who responded to the advert on your website was they should provide sexual services. ‘A lot of organisation went into this - the setting up of the website, the arrangement of accommodation and the fitting out of that accommodation with concealed cameras. ‘The complainant concedes frankly when she saw the website that she realised perfectly well what would be expected of her, were she to be given the sponsorship, was sexual services. ‘You led her to believe this was a stepping stone on to a sponsorship. ‘This was an elaborate lie and a thoroughgoing and pitiless deception. ‘The appropriate sentence is one of 16 months' imprisonment and it would be quite wrong to suspend that.’ Wearing a dark suit, white striped shirt and blue patterned tie, Lancaster stared straight ahead throughout the entire hearing and remained expressionless as he was led out of the dock. Patrick Harte, defending Lancaster, conceded his behaviour was ‘incredibly creepy’ and in pursuit of his ‘sordid fantasies’, adding: ‘It was cheap sex he was looking for and that’s what he thought he got. ‘He is devastated by the effect he has had on the victim. He did know the filming was wrong and he has no desire to blame the victim. ‘As she said, it was a scumbag of a thing for him to do. While Lancaster’s wife has forgiven him, he has been ‘blacklisted’ by former colleagues in the technology industry and is now unemployed with little prospect of finding work. ‘It is a very unpleasant mess’, Mr Harte added. Lancaster, of Waterlooville, Hampshire, admitted voyeurism and sex trafficking. He must also sign the Sex Offenders' Register for ten years.","Mark Lancaster, 40, set up scam website Sponsor A Scholar .

Teachers only discovered that Holli McCann had broken the chocolate ban because they opened and read a letter home in which she described how she and two friends had shared the bars on the first night of the week-long end-of-year trip.

Susan Taylor, 34, collapsed just one mile from the French coast as she swam under the guidance of the Channel Swimming Association, which officially authorises attempts, on Sunday July 14. Mrs Taylor, from Barwell, Leicsester, was pulled from the water and on to a support boat by her brother David, a paramedic, who battled to save her life before she was taken to hospital in nearby Boulogne-sur-Mer, where she was later pronounced dead. Her death prompted thousands of people to donate to Mrs Taylor’s two fundraising pages, in support of Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People and Diabetes UK. However, it has now emerged one donation to Rainbows, of £150,000, was a fake - something the charity described as an 'appalling act at such a tragic and emotional time'. It is believed a similar hoax pledge was also made to Diabetes UK. In a statement, Mrs Taylor’s family said: '[We] were obviously delighted when news of a donation pledge of £300,000 to the two charities was announced. 'Unfortunately, it would appear that this pledge was bogus since the funds have failed to materialise in the charities’ accounts. '[We] are disappointed and upset that an individual has taken actions which have misled the family and Susan’s chosen charities in this way. Devastated: Susan Taylor's husband Stephen (pictured at a Christmas party) was on the support boat . Brave: Mrs Taylor, 34, wanted to emulate David Walliams' charity swim but died one mile from France . Fundraiser: David Walliams, pictured during his 2006 Channel swim, is believed to have donated £1,000 . 'The family wish to emphasise that they are extremely grateful for the support of members of the public and the generosity they have shown in supporting Susan’s legacy. 'We do not intend to allow the actions of one person to detract from what Susan has accomplished and the pride we feel for her.' Legitimate donations to Mrs Taylor’s fundraising pages have soared to more than £70,000 in the days since her death. Much-loved: Susan's father described her as 'the best person in the world' Dedicated: Mrs Taylor had spent 18 months preparing for her arduous challenge for two charities . Prepared: Mrs Taylor's progress team posted this picture during her swim, writing: 'Easy way versus the hard way!!!!! Susan definitely deserves the easy way next time!!! She's doing fab :)' Comedian David Walliams - who swam the Channel in 2006 - is believed to have pledged £1,000 after a donation was made under the name of the Little Britain star with the message: 'Sending all my love to Susan’s family and friends'. Walliams tweeted later: 'Despite the shock & sadness, it’s good to see heroic Susan Taylor’s charity total rising. Please give what you can...' Mrs Taylor had given up her full-time job to carry out charitable work and was working part-time as an accountant, her family said. An online map tracking Ms Taylor's progress appeared to show that her support boat had suddenly sped up and sailed in a different direction towards land . Mrs Taylor was initially rescued from Wissant Bay near Cap Gris-Nez on the French coast . Before her solo attempt she told a newspaper that her training had been delayed a little by a shoulder injury and that she had put herself 'through hell' training over the last year. Geoff Ellis, chief executive at the Rainbows charity, condemned the hoax donations. He said: 'We are shocked that a person would carry out this appalling act at such a tragic and emotional time. 'Susan devoted her life to Rainbows and since her sad passing, kind-hearted people - many of whom did not know Susan - have honoured her memory by pledging generous donations to her online fundraising page. 'We have relayed the news to the family who are devastated that someone would exploit this heart-breaking situation.'

A husband who started an affair with his wife’s GP days after she died has claimed his Christian faith allowed him to ‘move on’. Robert Owens, 66, asked Dr Judith Ames to marry him 19 days after Joyce, 69, lost her fight against lung cancer. And although he admitted his relationship with the 52-year-old doctor had grown ‘very fast,’ he said: ‘I cared for my wife in her dying days. 'Genuine love story': Dr Judith Ames, 59, (right), with Robert Owens who she started a relationship with after treating his terminally ill wife . ‘Once she is dead, in my understanding, that’s it. I move on.’ Within a month the GP had moved into . the marital home to be with Mr Owens and told colleagues she would quit . her job if they disapproved. The pair are now engaged and are due to marry in September. Giving evidence to a hearing of the . Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, Mr Owens said soon after the . death of his wife, of 34 years, he realised that he and Dr Ames shared . the same ‘free spirit’. He even claims their relationship will ‘be of benefit to the community’. ‘I have this mental attitude that I . live for the present,’ he said. ‘I live with a very strong faith and . relationship with God and I’m able to deal with things very quickly.’ Mr Owens said he met Dr Ames a . fortnight after the death on March 8, so the GP could keep her promise . to Mrs Owens to attend church with her husband after her death. 'Love story': Mr Owens and Dr Ames are set to get married in September next year - although she could face being struck off the doctor's register for misconduct over the relationship . ‘Over those three or four days there . was a genuine love story that started on the Saturday, by the Tuesday I . proposed to Dr Ames to be my wife, so it is in the context of that . relationship growing very fast,’ he said. But friends and family were . unhappy about the situation and Dr Ames was reported to the General . Medical Council. He said: ‘My daughter, who I converse with every week, said, “Gosh dad that’s very quick but as long as you’re happy”. ‘My son replied in the same vein. With friends it depended how close they were with my wife. ‘One of my close friends said: “I can . see you are extremely happy but it’s like you are taking your Christmas . present and opening it early.”’ Dr Ames was working at the Mannamead . surgery in Plymouth when Mrs Owens – her husband’s second wife – went . for a consultation in May 2011 complaining of dizziness and was later . diagnosed with lung cancer. Over the following 10 months Dr Ames, a . mother-of-three, made regular trips to the couple’s home. Accused: Dr Ames worked as a GP partner at the Mannamead Surgery, in Plymouth, Devon, from May 2010 to May 2012 . She also visited them on the day Mrs Owens died. Although Mr Owens was also registered at the practice, Dr Ames never treated him, the panel in Manchester were told. Mr Owens, who has two children from his first marriage, said the care Dr Ames gave his second wife was ‘first-class’. He added: ‘I was attracted to the . qualities of compassion and care she had shown my wife. I discovered we . had a similar spirit. A spirit which is free. I would consider the . relationship a very close convergence of our characters and my proposal . for marriage is for a life-long relationship.’ The couple claim their relationship . was not sexual until after Mrs Owens passed away. However, the panel . heard that two days before Mrs Owens’ death, Dr Ames revealed to a . receptionist that she had developed a bond with Mr Owens and was off to . the couple’s home for ‘gin and tonics’. Mr Owens said it was not out of . character for him to move so quickly from one partner to the next . because had done the same with his second wife. ‘When my first wife left me, and I . realised that marriage was broken up, my motivation then was to find a . new partner,’ he added.

A cyclist was killed on a level crossing while seemingly oblivious to the approaching train because he was listening to music on his earphones. Phil Dawn, a father-of-three, failed to hear the passenger train’s horn as it thundered towards him, or the shouts of horrified bystanders who tried to stop the cyclist from moving on to the crossing. An inquest heard Mr Dawn, 34, ‘did not flinch’ despite the desperate attempts of two walkers to alert him to the oncoming danger. Giving evidence at Nottingham Coroner’s Court Thomas Butler said he and his friend Grant Pinhold heard the train twice sound its horn moments after seeing the cyclist ride on to the tracks - but he didn’t seem to hear them or the approaching train. Mr Dawn had been cycling home from his job as a precision engineer when he was hit by the train on the King’s Mill crossing near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. His earphones were hooked up to his mobile phone but were found to be dangling loose of his ears following the collision, meaning the coroner could not be certain he had been listening to them at the point of impact. But she recorded a verdict of accidental death after concluding Mr Dawn may have been distracted by listening to music in the build-up to the fatal incident. Jane Gillespie, the assistant deputy coroner for Nottinghamshire, said: ‘I conclude for reasons we will never know with absolute certainty, Mr Dawn rode on to the track with no regard for his safety. ‘I find in balance that Mr Dawn didn’t hear the shouts or the horn. Despite the sounding of the horn, he didn’t react, flinch, or divert from the path, let along look at the direction of the train. ‘Sadly I’m driven to the view that the single most important aspect in this case was the behaviour of Mr Dawn himself.’ At the time of the tragedy in May last year, Network Rail said Mr Dawn was thought to have been listening to music. Witnesses had reported seeing the cyclist, wearing headphones under his hood, approached the lowered barriers and manoeuvre his bike around them. The divorced father-of-three was cycling home from work when he was killed at the crossing near Mansfield. A 'stop, look, listen' sign was in place. Plans to install a red and green warning light two months before Mr Dawn's death had been delayed . The footpath crossing had ‘wicket gates’ and a ‘Stop, Look and Listen’ sign. The train which struck Mr Dawn had been travelling from Nottingham to Mansfield Woodhouse. The three-day inquest at Nottingham heard a risk assessment of the crossing in 2007 found that installing red and green warning lights at the location could improve safety. Network Rail had also drawn up plans to put a bridge over the train line at the crossing two months before Mr Dawn’s death. But the scale of the project meant it hadn’t been implemented. Rail bosses also said a number of changes had been made to the crossing since Mr Dawn’s death, including a redesigned approach to the crossing, vegetation management, and a temporary reduction in speed. A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘A very early feasibility study was completed at this site, as with many others in the East Midlands, to establish if it is physically possible to construct a bridge at this site.' Mr Dawn’s sister, Tracy Hart, 40, said . her brother, who was divorced, was not known to regularly wear earphones . while cycling, although he regularly commuted by bicycle to ‘keep up . his fitness’. Following the inquest at Nottingham Coroner's Court, Mr Dawn's sister Tracy Hart said 'human beings get distracted and make poor decisions' Mrs Hart, also of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, ‘We have always known that Phillip was not under the influence of any substances, was not breaking the law in any way, and only acted within human nature. ‘Phil wasn’t acting the fool, he was just cycling his way home after a hard day at work. ‘Human beings get distracted, make poor decisions and experience inattention blindness. Human beings in the 21st century wear earphones. ‘We hold the belief that Network Rail has a responsibility for user safety. All that was there was a basic black and white warning sign. ‘We feel it should have been in conspicuous bright colours that caught the eye. ‘The verdict of accidental death was expected but the family are disappointed that following the acceptance of Network Rail of a need for a bridge prior to the accident, that it failed to implement any interim safety measures such as a reduction in speed. ‘Since Philip only needed a fraction of a second more to get off the crossing, we believe that this would have saved his life.’","Phil Dawn 'did not flinch' when the train's horn sounded twice .

Richard Green who lost his temper and killed his three-year-old daughter with an 'immense' blow to the stomach has been jailed for seven years . A father who lost his temper and hit his three- year- old daughter with such force that it perforated her bowel and killed her, has been jailed for seven years. Richard Green, 23, lashed out in anger and 'delivered an immense blow' to the stomach of his child, Lia, as he resented looking after her on his own, a court heard . He was also seething with contempt towards his partner, Lia’s mother, Natalie Critchley, 21, whom he correctly suspected was having an affair at the time. Critchley was herself jailed for 21 months today after she failed to seek prompt medical help for Lia which would have 'almost certainly' saved her life, Preston Crown Court heard. Lia was taken to hospital on August 30 last year from the family home in Norris Street, Preston. She was later pronounced dead and a post-mortem examination found that part of her bowel had been severed by the force of the blow inflicted on her. Sentencing Green, Mr Justice MacDuff said: 'You lost all control. You hit, or perhaps kicked, Lia so violently that you caused the perforation of her duodenum. 'The force required to do that is immense.' He added to his 'wickedness' by then not calling an ambulance in the hours that followed, said the judge. Critchley also failed to seek help when she realised Lia was hurt and joined him in covering up the injuries through 'mistaken loyalty' to try to protect Green rather than her daughter. The judge told Critchley: 'You did play roulette with her life. You did not want to have to explain how she came to suffer her dreadful injuries and you hoped she would recover.' Green pleaded guilty in April to manslaughter during his murder trial, while Critchley was convicted of child cruelty by the jury. The trial heard that Critchley had begun seeing another man, the parent of a child at the nursery where she worked as a nurse. She was later pronounced dead and a post-mortem examination found that part of her bowel had been severed by the force of the blow inflicted on her . He was also seething with contempt towards his partner, Lia's mother, Natalie Critchley, 21, whom he correctly suspected was having an affair at the time. She has also been jailed for child cruelty after failing to seek help which would have saved her daughter's life . She lied to Green, claiming to be at pole-dancing lessons, to carry on the affair but he discovered what was going on in the weeks before Lia was killed. After an ambulance was eventually called, the defendants 'jointly concocted a series of breathtaking lies to save your own skins', said the judge. One such story they told detectives was that Lia had fallen off a swing. Anthony . Cross QC, defending Green, said: 'I suppose it is not a surprise that . at some stage this young father would use violence to his own child . because, sadly, he was himself the victim of extensive abuse as a child . which led to him being taken into care.'

ESPN has unexpectedly ended its relationship with freelance sports gambling columnist Sarah Phillips on Tuesday, just hours after a story surfaced online alleging that Phillips was involved in a fraud and extortion scheme. Phillips, a self-described hard-core gambler, was hired by ESPN in August of 2011 to write for its Page 2, now known as Playbook, after getting exposure for her work at the gambling site Covers.com. According to the website Deadspin, no one at either Covers or ESPN ever met Phillips personally, and it is not clear whether ESPN conducted a background check before taking her on as a freelancer. Who's that girl? Questions have long been raised about the true identity of sports gambling columnist Sarah Phillips, who was fired by ESPN . The report published by Deadspin claims that Phillips and her partner, Nilesh 'Nick' Prasad, received thousands of dollars from two men identified as 'Ben' and 'Matt.' The article also raised the possibility that the name 'Sarah Phillips' may be an alias. According to the story, 19-year-old 'Ben' was the founder of the Facebook page NBA Memes. Phillips recruited him for a business partnership, promising major returns, but then she and Prasad allegedly scammed 'Ben' into giving them the administrator rights to his page. Hostile takeover: Phillips and her partner allegedly duped the founder of the Facebook page NBA Memes into giving them the administrator rights to the site . Within days, the duo deleted 'Ben's' name from the list of administrators and took over the memes page, turning it into a getaway page to their own site, according to Deadspin. Deadspin also claims that Prasad misrepresented himself to 'Ben,' falsely claiming that he was the managing director of ESPN.com. Meanwhile, .

Elected police commissioners are showing a 'worrying' ability to evade rules when sacking chief constables, MPs have warned. Protections in place that allow police chiefs to fight their corner if they are being forced out appear to be being side-stepped, according to the Home Affairs committee. It says the early indications are that it is 'very easy' for a police and crime commissioner (PCC) to remove a chief constable for reasons of an 'insubstantial nature' and even the Home Secretary is powerless to intervene. Singled out: Gwent commissioner Ian Johnston was criticised for 'persuading' Chief Constable Carmel Napier to retire, bypassing the formal process . MPs warned it was further evidence that the checks and balances on PCCs are 'too weak'. They were particularly critical of Gwent commissioner Ian Johnston who 'persuaded' Chief Constable Carmel Napier to retire earlier this year, which meant the formal process was bypassed. The committee said the reasons given for the decision were 'unsubstantiated by any concrete examples'. It also rounded on him for criticising the grilling he received about the move at the hands of Labour MP Chris Ruane, who represents the Vale of Clwyd in North Wales. 'We were disappointed that, shortly after we took evidence from Mr Johnston, he took to Twitter to criticise a member of the committee for asking questions that he believed had been prompted by Gwent MPs, describing the proceedings as 'sad really',' the report said. Mr Johnson even described Mr Ruane as a 'plant of Gwent MPs'. This disdainful attitude towards scrutiny by Parliament, as well as an indication of a clear over-sensitivity to criticism, from a politician elected by less that 8% of the electorate, who had managed to side-step the statutory arrangements for local scrutiny of his decision to sack the chief constable, is further evidence, if any were needed, that the checks and balances on police and crime commissioners are too weak. PCCs, which replaced existing police authorities in 41 force areas across England and Wales, were handed the power to set force budgets and hire and fire chief constables. Just 15.1% of registered voters took part in the November 2012 PCC election - the lowest recorded level of participation at a peacetime non-local government election in Britain. Concern: Keith Vaz said it was 'worrying' that PCC seem able to side-step statutory process . MPs said it should 'not have come as any surprise' that there were a number of high-profile clashes between commissioners and chief constables following the reforms. Lincolnshire chief constable Neil Rhodes was suspended by PCC Alan Hardwick but was reinstated following a High Court judgment that described the decision 'irrational and perverse'. Commissioners remove chief constables by 'calling upon' them to resign or retire but they must first give a written explanation of the reasons for the proposal and then consider any response. Police and crime panels must make a recommendation to the commissioner within six weeks backing or opposing the plan and may consult HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Neither of the two chief constables removed had ended up going through the process, the committee said. Keith Vaz said: 'It is worrying that Police and Crime Commissioners seem able to side-step the statutory process for dismissing a chief constable. Police and Crime Panels should make more active use of their powers to scrutinise decisions such as this.' 'We will be returning to this area when we carry out our next major inquiry into Police and Crime Commissioners, towards the end of this year.'","MPs warn that the checks and balances on PCCs are 'too weak'

A drug addict burglar who scared to death a retired lecturer after he looted his home was jailed for 12 years today in a case which the judge said could 'make him weep'. Career criminal Anthony Curry, 39, admitted manslaughter after he caused 88-year old great grandfather Christopher Proctor to have a fatal heart attack when he burgled his house in Lancashire. As he saw the pensioner's body lying in the hallway, callous Curry then set fire to the £200,000 bungalow in Blackburn to cover up his crimes. Shame: Anthony Curry (left) has been jailed today for 12 years after he pleaded . guilty to the manslaughter of Christopher Proctor (right) Police and firefighters were called to the raging inferno to find the charred remains of Cambridge educated Mr Proctor inside. Accomplice: Curry's girlfriend Clare Randall was jailed for 2 years 7 months for her part in the burglary and attempted theft . A post mortem examination found he suffered from advanced heart disease and that his heart would not have been able to withstand the shock of the 3am break-in. He also had no soot in his lungs, proving he had died before the fire started. Curry was initially charged with murder but was cleared after he later admitted manslaughter, arson, burglary and attempted theft. His girlfriend Claire Randall, 30, admitted burglary and two charges of attempted theft and was locked away for two years and seven months. Passing sentence the judge Mr Justice Alistair MacDuff remarked: 'What a tragic case, this was lovely old man 88 years old, vulnerable and living alone - a retired lecturer with a degree from Cambridge, relatively well off, and who was targeted by people like you. 'It wasn't the first time you targeted this man. Well you say you are sorry, so you should be and I have read the impact statement from his daughter. I have read it three times now, it makes me want to weep. 'Here is grandfather, a great grandfather a beloved father lost to this family in the anguish that that it has heaped upon them because of you selfishness and your addiction to drugs.' Standing guard: A policeman outside the bungalow where the pensioner was scared to death when he came face-to-face with Curry as he burgled him . Terrible: Anthony Curry set fire to the bungalow home of Christopher Proctor in Blackburn, Lancashire, with him dead inside . Devastating: Christopher Proctor's scorched chair and the remains of a bench after the arson attack . Remains: This is a pile of charred items from the house left after Curry's callous blaze, which he used to cover-up his crimes . Preston Crown Court was told Mr Proctor described as am 'eccentric and well off' old man was a talented linguist and had lived at his home for 40 years. He had graduated from Pembroke College at Cambridge University before taking up a teaching post at an Accrington School. Between 1958 until his retirement in 1985 he taught at the former Blackburn Technical College. But it was feared news of his wealth was well known in the locality and Curry and his partner Clare Randall decided to rob him. Initially Curry sneaked into the house unbeknown to pensioner who was asleep in his downstairs bedroom. Curry searched the bungalow for two and a half hours and stole Mr Proctor's bank card whist Randall waited outside on the old man's driveway as a lookout. The pair then tried to withdraw cash from an ATM using the stolen cards but failed to get any money because Mr Proctor had changed his PIN number earlier that day. Curry then returned to Mr Proctor's home alone to search for a more accurate PIN number. It is thought Mr Proctor woke up on the second occasion to find Curry who turned on his heels and fled. In an attempt to get away, he slammed a door into Mr Proctor's face - fracturing the pensioner's nose and knocked him to the floor. He then suffered his fatal seizure. Despite being unable to find a conclusive cause of death, a pathologist said the fear Mr Proctor had felt when he discovered Curry in his home, combined with the shock of having a door slammed in to his face, could have proved fatal. Following the fire, officers recovered Mr Proctor's bank book and wallet which had been discarded in nearby drains. CCTV was recovered of Mr Proctor visiting a cash machine just hours before his death and he was changing his PIN number. Spotted: In the afternoon before he died, Mr Proctor was last seen using a cash machine at Tesco cash machine at around 3pm in November last year . Police soon discovered Mr Proctor had been befriended by Curry, who then preyed on his vulnerability to steal money from him. Officers later bugged the home Curry shared with Randall and secretly recorded them discussing different possible explanations for their actions. Passing sentence the judge added: 'You broke into his house the two of you and were in there for two and a half house on the night. 'It is not known precisely what you did on the occasions and it will never fully be known because only you knew what happened but drawers had been opened and searched. 'The telephone jack had been removed from the wall probably on the first visit and you emerged two and a half hours later with a bag of spoils and most particularly his wallet and bank cards but he had changed his PIN number over recent days presumably because of people like you, he was worried that he would be taken for another ride. 'It has to be accepted that this gentleman's death was probably almost certainly caused by cardiac arrest out of fear and shock. He was relatively healthy otherwise from having heart disease.

The stubborn weed has the power to penetrate concrete . Thousands of house sales are being hit by the spread of Japanese knotweed. Buyers are spending money on fees and surveys only to be told they cannot get a mortgage on a blighted property. Homeowners are facing bills of up to £20,000 to remove the prolific foreign invader before they can sell. Even those who are not directly affected by the superweed, but live near to a cluster, are seeing thousands taken off the value of their homes. The destructive bamboo-like plant has been sprouting across the country in recent years and the Government estimates it would take £1.5billion to clear the infestation. It can grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks, and easily spreads from neighbouring homes, wasteland, waterways, railway lines or footpaths. Its extensive deep roots can penetrate roads, concrete, damage foundations and drains. Small building societies such as Skipton and Leeds will decline mortgage applications on properties where Japanese knotweed is present. Others such as Barclays Bank, which also owns the Woolwich, and Santander, will decline them unless work is undertaken to remove it. While those such as Northern Rock, Clydesdale and Nationwide will consider it with guarantees or an indemnity in place, and guidance from a surveyor. David Hollingworth, from the mortgage adviser London & Country, said: ‘Japanese knotweed is a relatively new phenomenon and valuers are more aware of it as an issue. ‘The reason why lenders are saying they won’t lend is because in extreme circumstances, it will attack the structure of the property which could have a far-reaching impact. ‘It you don’t treat it, the property could become worthless.’ Even knotweed that is close to a property or adjacent could be enough to see a purchase fall down. Simon Wreford, is director of Japanese Knotweed Ltd, which advises homeowners, companies and councils. ‘I don’t think there is one village or town that hasn’t got knotweed, we are talking about thousands. ‘If the knotweed is within seven metres of your property, it is deemed to some degree a risk by lenders. Banks including Northern Rock will consider giving mortgages for a blighted property is there are guarantees in place. Barclays Bank's policy is to decline these mortgages unless the weed is removed . ‘We have recently seen that one or two lenders are saying no to mortgages where the property has knotweed.’ In one of the worst cases Matthew Jones and Sue Banks saw the value of their four-bedroom house in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire virtually wiped out after it dropped from £305,000 to £50,000 due to the damage caused. The weed had spread along the brick walls, forcing its way through flooring and had sprouted over skirting boards. It was on the brink of collapsing. Knotweed was introduced into Britain by the Victorians and has the scientific name fallopia japonica.","Homeowners are facing bills of up to £20,000 to remove plant before they can sell .

While to many it would seem a prerequisite for the job, the word is not mentioned anywhere in the profession’s current official code of conduct. Such an obligation could lead to more nurses being struck off or suspended for failing to care properly for patients or treat them with dignity. While to many it would seem a prerequisite for the job, the word is not mentioned anywhere in the profession¿s current official code of conduct . The Nursing and Midwifery Council is to overhaul its code of conduct, an eight-page handbook setting out good practice, in the wake of a damning report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal which ordered the profession to show more compassion. Concerns over nursing standards were also raised in two separate reports this week. One, into the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway, said many nurses were ‘callous and brutal’ in their treatment of dying patients. The other, into needless deaths at 11 failing hospital trusts, found nurses did not have time for basic acts of compassion such as holding the hand of a dying patient. Professor Judith Ellis, a member of the NMC council, said the new code of conduct would be drawn up this autumn. Such an obligation could lead to more nurses being struck off or suspended for failing to care properly for patients or treat them with dignity . When asked at a conference of NHS managers in London whether the word ‘compassion’ should be introduced, she replied: ‘I cannot guarantee it, but it is likely.’ She added: ‘We have a working party to look in depth at the code. There isn’t much wrong with it, but it needs to be reviewed because it can get out of date.’ Introducing a requirement to show compassion would send a powerful message to the profession, reminding nurses of their basic duties and could see more staff being struck off or suspended if they fall short. At present, very few nurses are disciplined just for not being compassionate. The most common offence for those struck off or suspended is physical abuse, followed by failing to keep adequate records. Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer for NHS England, backed the move, saying: ‘It is appropriate that compassion is reflected in the code of conduct.’ Baroness Emerton, a retired nurse and crossbench peer, said nurses should not be put out at being reminded to show compassion. ‘You would hope that all nurses have compassion but it can be difficult if patients are aggressive,’ she said. ‘I do not think any nurse should be offended by being told that in difficult circumstances they have to stay compassionate.’ Roger Goss, of Patient Concern said: ‘Nurses should be reminded that they must be kind and considerate to patients. ‘They shouldn’t be abdicating this responsibility to healthcare assistants - they should be setting a leading example.’","Not mentioned anywhere in the profession’s current official code of conduct .

Girls should be ‘disruptive’ in class as challenging authority will help them in their careers, according to the boss of a leading private school group. Dr Kevin Stannard, head of innovation and learning at the Girls’ Day School Trust, which runs 26 schools, said it was common for girls to be praised for good manners, politeness and even neat written work. But it would be more ‘empowering’ for young women to question what they are told and take risks, he said. Disruptive: Girls should not be encouraged to be polite but learn to challenge authority, Dr Kevin Stannard said (file picture) Girls now outperform boys at every stage of their education, from primary school exams to GCSEs and A-Levels and are more likely to attend university and graduate with a good degree. However men earn around 10 per cent more than women, recent figures showed, and Dr Stannard warned that praising girls for their politeness, neatness and balanced well thought-out essays may be counterproductive. In an article in the Times Educational Supplement, he questioned whether the education system was ‘doing girls a long-term disservice’ by conforming to gender stereotypes of behaviour. Dr Stannard said ‘Of course, encouragement of ‘misbehaviour’ should only go so far. We don’t want to motivate students to not value academic success. ‘But disruptiveness - as in the willingness to question, suggest alternatives, challenge, take risks, adapt and lead - can be very empowering.’ He quoted authors who claim that ‘disruption is a proven path to success’ suggesting that girls learn to ‘challenge and influence authority’. Schools should alter their view of ‘disruptiveness’ as something to be discouraged, he said, instead embrace it as something ‘not so very far from those of resourcefulness, resilience, enterprise, adventurousness, risk-taking, determination, standing up for yourself, leadership and connectivity, which good schools do indeed seek to encourage and develop in girls.’ He praised a proposal at independent Putney High School in South West London to give sixth formers lessons in stand-up comedy to improve their risk-taking skills and show them how to ‘think on their feet’. Last term pupils from single-sex Wimbledon High School, a private girls school also in South West London, were taught about boasting, self-promotion and celebrating success as part of an innovative ‘blow your own trumpet week’. Dr Stannard said that other single-sex schools had promoted debating societies and encouraged pupils to sit tests with ‘impossible questions’ to get them to think in different ways. He argued: ‘As testing in schools becomes ever more standardised, modularised and tick-box in form, we run the risk of inadvertently encouraging girls in their typically more measured, stepwise approach to tasks. ‘When we give higher marks to essays that show balance and give equal weight to opposing arguments, and praise girls who shine in set-piece performances, recitations and productions, we could be setting them up to fail when they face more competitive, combative situations such as interviews for selective universities.’ Challenge: Exams encourage girls to be too safe and give balanced answers instead being prepared for combative situations . Dr Stannard has previously spoken out about the need for more male teachers in both boys and girls schools so children do not associate certain jobs with men or women. But the chief executive of the GDST group, which regularly top the school league tables, made headlines last year by saying girls should work as hard at finding a good husband as on their careers. Helen Fraser, 63, told the trust’s annual conference girls should be ‘ambitious’ in their relationships just as they aspire to the top universities - as they need to find the right partner who ‘shares the load at home’ if they want to have it all, a career, marriage and motherhood.","Dr Kevin Stannard said young women should be empowered to take risks .

When baby Isaac Curtis was born struggling to breathe, doctors decided he needed immediate specialist treatment. He was whisked away from his parents to two different hospitals hundreds of miles away as doctors fought to save his life. But the family were able to be reunited closer to home after the Children's Air Ambulance took Isaac back safely to his local hospital in Somerset in a specialist 'baby pod' which enabled him to breathe. Tiny Isaac wore miniature ear defenders for his helicopter trip, which took him 170 miles from Leicester to Musgrove Hospital, Taunton, in just 59 minutes. First flight: Baby Isaac had tiny ear defenders strapped to his head for the helicopter journey . Transfer: The Children's Air Ambulance was called to fly Isaac from Leicester Glenfield Hospital, where he was having life-saving treatment, to Taunton Musgrove Hospital so he could be close to his family . Doctors first became concerned about Isaac's condition moments after birth when it was clear he was in severe respiratory distress and had lung tissue damage. He was diagnosed with acute meconium aspiration - caused when the baby breathes in its own waste products during birth - after a long two-day labour. Paramedics immediately drove him to Bristol Royal Infirmary where he was put on a mechanical ventilator to clear his lungs, but doctors told his mother Rebecca he was unlikely to survive the 50-mile journey and that she should prepare for the worst. Although Isaac did make the journey the ventilator was not effective, so consultants at the hospital called in a specialist team from Leicester Glenfield Hospital. The team brought the only mobile ECMO - or Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation - machine in the country, which artificially pumps blood and oxygen around the body. Safe: Isaac was put into a specialist baby pod where he was kept attached to breathing equipment throughout the flight . On the mend: Isaac is now back home and is expected to make a full recovery with no long-term side effects . They then took Isaac to the Leicester hospital where he spent two nights having ECMO treatment and started responding well. Mrs Curtis and her husband had . followed their son up the country by car, but as travelling was . difficult after her problematic labour, she was thrilled to learn Isaac . would be returning home to Taunton. The baby was stabilised in the . Children's Air Ambulance baby pod before being flown by pilots Shaun . Tinkler Rose and Paul Hogan back to Somerset, while his parents took the . five-hour journey by road. Growing strong: Isaac is now back home with mother Rebecca Curtis where he is using an oxygen tube to help his lungs recover . Mrs Curtis said it was incredibly hard to put her baby in the hands of the helicopter crew, but she was reassured when they let her on board to take pictures before they took off, and because they called her regularly to let her know how it was going. She said: 'I knew he was in the best hands and it was the best parting from Isaac I could have had.' After three weeks' further treatment in the Taunton hospital, Isaac is back home and doing well, although he is still on oxygen. He is expected to make a full recovery with no long-term side effects. Mrs Curtis now plans to run a half marathon next year to raise money for the Children's Air Ambulance as a thank-you. She said: 'The Children’s Air Ambulance provides an amazing service and we are so grateful that they were there to help Isaac when he needed them most.' The Children’s Air Ambulance is the only helicopter ambulance service in England and Wales solely dedicated to transferring critically ill children and babies to specialist hospitals and is fitted with paediatric equipment. The charity, which is entirely funded by public donations, got its first helicopter in October 2012. The helicopter is an Agusta Grand 109S which can reach speeds of up to 200mph. Nearly two thirds of the children which are helped by the air ambulance are under three months old.","Isaac Curtis was born with severe breathing problems after long labour .

Catfight: Marjory Ramson, 83, has had a solicitor¿s letter demanding £500 compensation for a bite inflicted by a cat which she no longer consider hers (file photo) When her cat decided to move in with the neighbours, Marjory Ramson assumed he was no longer her responsibility. Not in the eyes of the law. The 83-year-old has had a solicitor’s letter demanding £500 compensation for a bite inflicted by Henry the ginger tom. The victim, Linda Close, says the wound was so deep she had to spend four days in hospital and faced possible amputation. The grandmother-of-six-says she has never had any problems before and said the cat was well-behaved ever since her late husband bought it three and a half years ago. After being confronted by Miss Close after the incident, Mrs Ramson agreed to have Henry put down – much to her distress as the cat was a reminder of her late husband, Bob, who passed away aged 85. The grandmother of six, who works part-time in a charity shop, said: ‘The cat was a great comfort to him when he was dying so it was always nice to see him around.’ But as cats often do, after the death of its owner, Henry left Mrs Ramson’s home and became something of a ‘neighbourhood pet’. Shortly afterwards he was taken in by a family who lived behind the Ramsons’, who renamed him Cyril and let him sleep at the end of their bed. Earlier this year, however, the family moved home, letting the property to Linda Close and her two teenage children who agreed to continue taking care of him. But on the day they moved in the 46-year-old full-time carer says she was bitten so badly the doctors said her hand may need to be amputated. She subsequently captured the cat, took it to the vets and discovered it had been micro-chipped and belonged to the Ramsons. It was then that she consulted Ralli Solicitors, who wrote to the 83-year-old. The letter demand she pay £500 for Miss Close’s medical report and stated: ‘The reason we are alleging fault is that you are negligent and/or breached your statutory duty pursuant to the Animals Act. ‘We allege that your cat exhibited characteristics which were known to you as its owner and that you failed to take sufficient steps to prevent the attack.’ Feral feline: Henry the ginger tom bit Mrs Ramson's neighbour Linda Close so badly she faced amputation (file photo) But Mrs Ramson said: ‘I was so shocked to receive the letter, at first I didn’t even believe it was for me. I thought it must be some mistake. ‘I liked seeing Henry every now and then and would leave milk out for him, but as far as I was concerned he had moved on as cats often do. ‘I haven’t been able to sleep ever since and I just don’t know what to do. When I first received the letter I was worried that they’d send me to prison,’ she said. ‘If it is true what happened to this lady, it is very unfortunate, but it honestly has nothing to do with me. She added: ‘The only time he ever bit me was when I stood on its tale once and it gave me a nip, but I didn’t draw blood.’ However, Miss Close, who is a full-time carer for her mother and father who live next door, said she believed Mrs Ramson knew about the cat’s alleged aggressive behaviour. ‘I love cats and have them as pets and this has never happened to me before,’ she said. I lent down to give him a stroke, he rolled onto his back and was purring then he suddenly bit into my hand with both paws. ‘It left two marks on my hand, which by the morning had swelled up like a balloon and I couldn’t move my thumb.’ She said she couldn’t drive because of the swelling and had to call her friend to drive her to A&E, after her local GP told her the infection was serious. Miss Close said she has ‘never been so scared in her life,’ adding that doctors told her they feared she may have to have it amputated. ‘I was worried I wouldn’t be able to care for my parents,’ she said.","Marjory Ramson, 83, has had a letter demanding £500 compensation .

A bank manager who stole over £300,000 from elderly and vulnerable customers’ accounts so she could ‘fit in with the golfing wives’ in her village has been jailed for three years and four months. Celia Zarebska withdrew £500 cash several times a month, targeting accounts with large sums of money which had been left dormant due to the owner’s ill health or age. The 52-year-old, a £17,000-a-year manager at a Santander branch in Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire, said she had spent the money lavish holidays and expensive dresses. Zarebska siphoned money out of customers’ accounts for seven years before she was caught, Leicester Crown Court heard today. Her thefts were discovered when a woman tried to make a withdrawal from her aunt’s account, meant to contain £62,000, and found it was empty. Zarebska denied any wrong-doing when quizzed by bank investigators, but admitted the offences when she was arrested by the police. She told detectives she had spent the money on paying off the mortgage on her husband’s detached home and buying holidays and clothes ‘to fit in with the golfing wives’. Around £315,000 was taken in total between 2004 and 2011. At least one of Zarebska’s five victims was living in a care home, and another died before she took their money. Zarebska admitted a total of nine charges of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting. The Santander branch where she worked has since closed down. Detective Constable Jenny Tattersall, of . Leicestershire Police’s Serious Crime Team, said: ‘This was sustained . dishonesty over a long period.'

A further 261 people have been injured after fights broke out between Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and locals shortly after 9pm and continued into early hours this morning.

Military helicopters hovered overhead . and police vans were brought in to quell the trouble, but when that . didn't work, dozens of riot police moved in. Medics treated men with . deep gashes to their eyes and faces nearby. 'I've had enough of this chaos,' said Ashraf Mohamed, who watched the clashes from a distance. 'Egypt is just rubbish.' Mohamed's frustration echoed the view of . millions of Egyptians who rallied for Morsi's resignation on June 30. The military said it deposed him to fulfill the wish of the people.

Tens . of thousands of Brotherhood supporters gathered late on Monday at the . Rabaa Adawiya mosque in northeastern Cairo, where they have staged a . sit-in vigil for the last three weeks vowing to stay until Mursi is . reinstated. Another large . crowd rallied outside Cairo University, and there were protests in the . coastal city of Alexandria and the Nile city of Assiut.

Egypt has become increasingly polarised by the crisis, but one thing the two sides share is a deep mistrust of the United States and its perceived role in the unrest. It comes as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns told reporters in Cairo that Washington had no desire to meddle in Egypt, which it supports with $1.5 billion in aid each year, most of which goes to the military.

'Only Egyptians can determine their future,' Burns told reporters at the U.S. embassy. 'I did not come with American solutions. Nor did I come to lecture anyone. We will not try to impose our model on Egypt.' Washington, never comfortable with the rise of the Islamist Brotherhood, has so far refused to say whether it views Morsi's removal as a coup, which would require it to halt aid. The Islamist Nour Party and the Tamarud anti-Mursi protest movement both said they turned down invitations to meet Burns. But a senior State Department official denied Burns had been shunned. 'I don't think we're losing influence at all,' the U.S. official said, adding that Burns was still in Cairo. 'I don't know what meetings he has, but he has seen a range of people in Cairo in the interim government, in civil society ... so it's hard to say he has been spurned by both sides. I don't accept that is the case.' Gas clouds: Tear gas can be seen on a bridge in downtown Cairo after supporters of President Morsi tried to block main river passes . Fleeing the scene: Supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi run from tear gas in Cairo . Morsi, meanwhile, is being held incommunicado at an undisclosed location. He has not been charged with a crime but the authorities say they are investigating him over complaints of inciting violence, spying and wrecking the economy. Scores of Morsi supporters were rounded up after violence last week. Many of the top Brotherhood figures have been charged with inciting violence, but have not been arrested and are still at large. The public prosecutors' office announced new charges against seven Brotherhood and Islamist leaders on Monday. Burns had earlier called for restraint on both sides. 'If representatives of some of the largest parties in Egypt are detained or excluded, how are dialogue and participation possible?' he asked. He also urged those opposed to Mursi's ouster to participate in the political process peacefully. Interim President Adli Mansour and his prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi head a transitional cabinet full of technocrats that is paving the way for parliamentary elections in around six months, in a bid to restore civilian rule.

Filling the air: A picture of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi hangs on the side of the October Bridge in Cairo as tear gas fills the air around it . U.S.-educated economist Ahmed Galal, as finance minister, has the task of rescuing an economy and state finances wrecked by two and a half years of turmoil. That task became easier, at least in the short term, after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait - rich Gulf Arab states happy at the downfall of the Brotherhood - promised a total of $12 billion in cash, loans and fuel. The new planning minister, Ashraf al-Arabi, said the Arab money would be enough to sustain Egypt through its transition period and it did not need to restart talks with the International Monetary Fund. Egypt had sought $4.8 billion in IMF aid last year, but months of talks ran aground with the government unable to agree on cuts in unaffordable subsidies for food and fuel. Arabi's comments could worry investors who want the IMF to prod reform. 'I think it's inappropriate to be making such a strong statement, given how new he is to the position,' said Angus Blair, president of the Signet Institute, an economic think tank.

The Olympics have already given a £10billion boost to the British economy, ministers claimed yesterday. In a glossy 70-page brochure, ministers put the trade boom from the Games slightly higher than the cost of staging them last summer. But the figures were immediately met with scepticism as the report directly linked the Olympics effect to building projects that included a shopping  centre in Croydon, South London. Boom: As the anniversary of the Opening Ceremony approaches, the government claims the London 2012 Games brought a £9.9billion boost to the UK economy . Anniversary: One year on from London 2012 a 30,000-strong crowd enjoyed a day in the sun at the Go Local concert at London's Olympic Park . Business Secretary Vince Cable conceded . the figure was ‘not a rigorous academic approach’ and some of the . investment ‘would have happened anyway’. But he said London 2012 had been a . catalyst for foreign investment into the UK and made projects progress . more quickly than they  otherwise would have. In a report from the Government and . the Mayor of London, it was claimed that the Games had already generated . £9.9billion for the economy, exceeding their £9.3billion cost. This includes £2.5billion in projects . such as the development of South London’s Battersea Power Station . backed by Malaysia, a Chinese-funded regeneration of London’s Royal . Albert Docks, and the forthcoming Westfield shopping centre in Croydon. Prime Minister David travelled to the Olympic Park to hand out goody bags to Olympic Games Makers who were there to celebrate one year on from the Olympic and Paralympic Games . Mr Cameron joined London Mayor Boris Johnson to see construction work which is transforming the site into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park which will be open later this month . The Australian firm – which already . has two Westfield centres in London, including one next to the Olympic . Stadium in Stratford – signed a £1billion deal in January to revamp an . existing shopping centre in Croydon, after being in talks since 2011. The rest is made up of £5.9billion of . additional sales and overseas sports contracts awarded to British firms . for events such as the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, both in . Brazil. By 2020, the Games could add £41billion of value to the economy, the report says. Mr Cable, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said: ‘Would this have happened anyway? Some of these activities clearly would, but the Olympics were a key catalyst in making those investment decisions real.’ Contracts: The report suggests that since the Olympic Park closed last summer British companies have gone on to win contracts for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio . Rebuilding: Construction workers have been on site since the closing ceremony preparing the venues to be reopened to the public . But Labour’s Lord Harris, chairman of . Parliament’s Olympic and Paralympic Legacy Committee, said: ‘I’m afraid . you have to take all of these figures with a large pinch of salt.’ Mr Cable said: ‘The answer we’ve had . with a lot of the high-profile investment is that a lot of the key . negotiations [with investors] came out of the events that we organised . around the Olympics. An enormous amount of effort was put . in to try to attract big inward investment, to try to support British . businesses to get business on the back of it.’ During the Games, lavish  hospitality . was extended to  foreign dignitaries and business leaders at the . British Business Embassy in Lancaster House in London, in the hope of . attracting a trade windfall. David Cameron yesterday said: ‘This . £9.9billion boost to the UK economy is a reminder to the world that, if . you want the best, if you want professionalism, if you want jobs done on . time  and on budget, then you should think British.’ Claiming credit: Business Secretary Vince Cable admitted some of the investment would have happened anyway while London Mayor Boris Johnson claimed a new shopping centre in Croydon could be attributed to the Olympics .

Teachers’ unions prompted uproar last night by suggesting schools should be closed because of the heatwave. They insisted there should be a maximum legal temperature of 26C (79F) at which teachers should be expected to work – a limit which would have meant children being sent home across most of the country for the last fortnight. Many schools are due to break up for the summer holidays within the next week, but union bosses claimed staff are struggling with ‘hot and stuffy’ classrooms. The teachers' union said that they could not work in high temperatures as it would reduce concentration . General secretary of the National Union of Teachers Christine Blower said: ‘Clearly, very high temperatures can affect the ability of teachers and pupils to concentrate and to work effectively, and can cause physical discomfort and illness. ‘The NUT will continue to campaign to ensure that 26C is the absolute maximum temperature in which teachers should be expected to work.’ Christine Blower said that high temperatures affect the ability of teachers to work and concentrate . Chris Keates, of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, said: ‘Our research revealed teachers and pupils sweltering in classrooms with inadequate ventilation with not even blinds at the windows which could be used to provide some limited shade. ‘The impact of excessive temperatures on teaching and learning needs to be given serious consideration. 'Lessons are disrupted by constant requests for time out to get drinks of water or to go outside, and many tasks take far longer to perform.’ Their remarks were condemned by Conservatives, who said parents would be hugely inconvenienced by school closures. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It seems to  me all the unions do is try to find an excuse for teachers not to be at work. For goodness’ sake, everyone else has to work when  it’s hot.’ Guidance from Public Health England says schools could consider starting or finishing lessons early to combat the heat.","Insisted there should be a maximum legal working temperature of 26C (79F)

With the success of Team GB in the velodrome and high profile celebrities frequently spotted out and about on their bikes, our passion for cycling is stronger than ever. And as the Giro D'Italia sets off on 4 May and the Tour de France gears up for its 100th edition in June, Vintage Seekers, a source for original collectibles, celebrates the sport with a range of nostalgic cycling posters. Produced in small numbers and preserved in excellent condition, the posters celebrate the beginning of a golden age of cycling. 1925 Cycles Omega original poster. This circa 1925 poster is in very good condition. The poster was printed at Imprimeries Réunies, Lyon and is stone lithograph. £1,000 . The bright colours and the evocative designs of these retro pieces are an art and bike lover's dream. The combination of endurance, grace, grit and exceptional fitness in the sport of cycling capture the imagination, and is celebrated in these hundred-year old posters. The late 1800s saw an explosion of cycling as a pastime combined with the rising popularity of poster advertising. As such, many bicycle manufacturers created beautiful artworks that evoked the joy of jumping on a bike and hitting the road, whether for sport or more genteel pleasure. 1905 original advertising poster for White Cycles.

Great poster artists such as Leonetto Cappiello, the Italian-born Paris-based illustrator considered the father of modern advertising, Jean de Paleologue, Jules Chéret, Henri Gray and Adolphe Mouron Cassandre all produced iconic and visually arresting posters for races, cycle shops and bike companies such as Peugeot, Liberator, Cycles Sirius, Alcyon and Omega. While the early posters embodied the . glorious, evocative style of the Belle Époque, with women shown in . goddess-like poses riding or pushing bicycles, later posters became more . graphic, enhancing the simple geometric shapes of the bike itself. As many of these posters were created cheaply on thin paper stock and were not intended to last more than a few weeks, let alone years, they have become increasingly rare and many now fetch considerable sums of money at auction. In 2009, a deceptively simple poster created in 1925 by AM Cassandre for Cycles Brilliant sold at auction in New York for $31,200 (£20,145) - well over the $15,000 - $20,000 estimate. 1962 original Swiss vintage poster for the Swiss National Circus, titled ""Knie.

Microsoft has announced it will launch an update to the latest version of its Windows operating system - Windows 8 - because of complaints about how difficult the software is to use. The mover, seen by many as a U-turn, is part of a software package that has been given the codename, 'Blue'. However, the update won't be released to consumers and businesses until later this year. The homescreen on Windows 8 is made up of interactive tiles that you use your mouse or finger to swipe across. This layout was designed for touchscreen devices, yet PC and mouse users have criticised it for being too difficult to use. Many have called for a return to the desktop view as seen in previous versions of the Windows operating system . Windows 8 has interactive . tiles and swiping menus that were designed to work best on touchscreen devices. PC and mouse users have heavily criticised this because it is difficult to get used . Another common complaint has centered on the lack of a 'start' button in the Windows 8 menu. Other critics want the system to boot . up in desktop mode by default, instead of showing the mosaic of . interactive tiles that you need to swipe through, and were designed to . be used on touchscreen devices. Windows 8 was released last October and was a major overhaul in terms of design, compared to previous versions. Many users have criticised it for being too difficult to use, and the Blue update is expected to respond to these complaints. Tami Reller, Windows' marketing and financial chief, told the FT 'key aspects' of the software would be changed. 'The learning curve is definitely real,' she admitted. Microsoft hasn't said whether it will charge existing Windows 8 users to get the update, or when it will be available, although it is expected around October. More details about Blue . will be released before Microsoft's developer conference in San . Francisco in late June. Some of Blue's features are also expected to be . previewed at this conference. Microsoft hoped Windows 8 would play a more . prominent role in the growing mobile market while still . maintaining its dominance in PCs. Research firm, . International Data Corp said Windows 8 contributed to a 14 percent . decline in worldwide PC sales during the first three months of the year - . the biggest year-over-year drop ever. Meanwhile, sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming. The biggest beneficiaries have been . Apple, with its iPhone and iPad, and Samsung, which sells the most mobile devices running Google's Android . software. Microsoft launched its first 10.6 inch tablet, called the Surface, last October. It was the first tablet to launch running a mobile version of the Windows 8 operating system. Rumours suggest that with the 'Blue' update, Microsoft may be looking at releasing smaller versions of this device later this year . Google is also benefiting from Android's popularity through . increased traffic to its services. By contrast, leading PC makers such . as Hewlett-Packard and Dell, which primarily sell . Windows-powered machines, have seen a drop in sales and suffered slumps in stock values. Despite this, Microsoft insists it's pleased with Windows 8's performance. The company claims more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses have been . sold so far, up from about 60 million licenses in January. According to Tami Reller, the licensing . volume 'is in the same general ballpark,' as Windows 7 - Microsoft's previous . operating system. Sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming, while PC sales are slumping. According to marketing firm IDC, sales of the iPad passed 141m last year . Reller said Blue is being released because Microsoft realised changes need to be made to make Windows 8 . easier to use. She added that Blue will also improve Windows 8's ability to work on smaller tablets . with 7- and 8-inch display screens. Although she declined to say . whether Microsoft intends to make smaller version of its own Surface . tablets. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also . predicted that the company's fortunes will be buoyed by iPad users switching to Windows 8 tablets. During an . interview with CNBC, Gates . said: 'Users of iPad and Android tablets might not have noticed, but a . lot of them are 'frustrated' because they 'can't type, they can't create . documents, they don't have [Microsoft] Office there.' Since April 2012, iPad sales have passed 141m. According to market intelligence firm IDC, total . tablet sales have reached 253m, and less than 2m of those are for Microsoft's Surface tablet. Analysts . say one reason Windows 8 got off to a slow start is because there . weren't enough devices designed to take advantage of the system's . touch-screen features. Robert . Rutherford, managing director of specialist IT consultancy, QuoStar . Solutions, added: 'Windows 8 was a failure of timing, not of design. Bill Gates, the founder of the Microsoft Corporation, believes that many iPad users are 'frustrated'. He claims that because they can't type on their tablets, they will ultimately switch to devices running Microsoft Office and Windows 8, such as the company's Surface tablet which launched last October . 'Microsoft has set itself up in 2013 as a source of creativity and innovation, the problem is that the new vibe doesn’t yet gel with what users know and expect from the brand. 'On this occasion Microsoft pushed the envelope too much, but the time for these innovations will come. 'It’s important that Microsoft keeps doing what it’s doing to provide a challenge to Apple’s creative dominance.' Given how different that Windows 8 is from its predecessors, Reller said Microsoft always knew it might have to make some adjustments less than a year after the software came out. 'It had to be a very big change to take advantage of the mobile opportunity,' she said. 'As we look at Windows 8, it's important to remember a lot of its full potential won't be realised until there are more touch devices on the market,' Reller said.","Windows Blue will make Windows 8 easier to use after critics slammed it for being too complicated .

A German company is threatening to destroy the view in a picturesque corner of the Cotswolds by building a solar farm. Belectric, one of the world’s biggest solar energy companies, already owns 200 large solar farms around the globe and has set its sights on Britain. The Bavaria-based firm, which has a UK subsidiary in Iver, Buckinghamshire, already has three 30-acre farms in Cornwall and a fourth such installation in Cambridge. Beautiful countryside: Residents in Willersey, Gloucestershire have formed a campaign group to fight against solar development to ruin their views . It has also found plots for a further five in the South and East of England and is exploring other counties. Its planned incursion into the Cotswolds, a symbol of England’s green and pleasant land, has outraged the community. The 25-acre solar farm in the Gloucestershire village of Willersey would provide power to 1,500 homes. But villagers are determined to protect the vista from the nearby Broadway Tower landmark, which they say would be spoiled by the development. A new campaign group, Save Our Cotswold Countryside, has been formed to fight the plan to scar the landscape with 66,000, 9ft-tall, shiny metal panels. Locals fear the solar farm will deter tourists, hit property prices and damage the local economy. Outcry: Cotswold residents are furious that they may have green fields around their villages covered in solar farms . Sarah Bent, a co-founder of the group, who has run a bed-and-breakfast near Willersey for 18 years, said: ‘Millions of people come to the Cotswolds to enjoy  the gentle hills and beautiful scenery. Now our green fields could  be obliterated.’ Ronan Lynch, who owns the land, believes a solar farm is right for the site. He tried farming but the soil is too poor to grow crops. He declined to discuss potential profits from the deal but income from similar contracts varies from £600 to £1,000 a year per acre. Mr Lynch said: ‘The only people who will see it are trespassers on the land or anyone who uses a footpath at the back of the site. It could power 1,500 homes and that has to be a good thing.’ Belectric is organising a meeting to address the villagers’  concerns. Eyesore: Farmer Adam Twine looking out across a huge bank of solar panels in Watchfield, Oxfordshire . Director Toddington Harper said: ‘We do not believe there will be any visual impact. I am passionate about what we’re doing but the sites have to be well screened and not on prime agricultural land.’ Councillors will make a decision on May 20. The gold rush for solar power started in Britain two years ago when the Government offered financial incentives for firms to invest in renewable energy. According to industry regulator Ofgem, there are 589 large-scale solar farms in Britain.","One of the world’s biggest solar energy companies has its eye on UK .

All kinds of forms of transport are going electric these days, as scientists and engineers dream up new ways to get us around without spewing clouds of harmful fossil fuel emissions. But they have perhaps gone a little far this time, by electrifying one form of transport that never actually caused any greenhouse gases at all. The Mando Footloose is claimed to be built around the world's first chainless hybrid technology for an e-bike. Something seems to be missing... The Mondo Footloose claims to be the world's first e-bike to operate without a chain . Like other pedelecs the Footloose combines manual and electric power. However, unlike other similar machines, it totally eliminates the chain and transforms the cyclist's efforts directly into electricity to drive the wheels. Made by Korean auto-parts supplier Mando Corp, the Footloose is based on the premise that the chain is the most annoying component in most bikes, Gizmag reports. So instead of using one to drive the . wheels, the bike's pedals transform the riders kinetic energy directly . into electricity via an alternator connected to the crank. Compact: When not in use the Footloose folds up for easy carriage on public transport or in the boot of a car . This energy is then stored in a lithium-ion battery inside the bikes frame, before it is converted back into kinetic energy by an electric motor which drives the rear wheel. Like a modern car, the Footloose has an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) which works with sensors to monitor terrain and an automatic gear changer to adjust the motor's output to suit. This ECU also monitors the contraption to identify any problems, which it then displays by means of a handlebar mounted HMI (Human Machine Interface). The HMI, which also gives the rider data about distance travelled, speed and the amount of electricity produced, is removable and doubles as an integrated anti-theft device since the bike will only start if its connected. Mando have not announced a price for the product, but it has been reported that it is scheduled for release some time in 2013. However, critics point out that the overall efficiency of the machine may be a weak point. With a chain-drive working out at about 98 per cent efficient, it is difficult for any new technology to equal the raw capabilities of a standard bicycle.","The Mondo Footloose transforms pedal power directly into electric energy .

Daily Beast. Started after a fundraising event that attracted donations from comic book enthusiasts and artists around the country – including DC Comics – earned $22,000, Aurora Rise’s mission is to ‘make the days ahead of those affected… a little bit brighter.’ Sullivan and his daughter were invited by founder Jason Farnsworth to be board members, according to the Daily Beast. Farnsworth, the owner of a local comic book store, and Sullivan came up with the idea of a series of sketches depicting comic book heroes guarding the entrance to Aurora’s Century 12 Theater, though sold online and at charity events for $7.20, it became invaluable to one survivor almost instantly. The idea for the sketchbook was born out of Sullivan wanting to cheer up a 12-year-old boy who had been part of his deceased son’s group in the theater the night of the shooting, Sullivan told the Daily Beast. Having met the boy during his son’s casket viewing and remembering how a copy of Green Lantern he gave the boy helped him cope, Sullivan asked a local artist to make a sketch of the Green Lantern standing guard over the theater entrance, as if to tell the boy it was time go back to the movies, that idea turned into a sketchbook now sold online and at charity events, according to the charity’s site.

But for actress Christina Ricci, her past style disasters are plastered all over the internet. As the child star of films including The Addams Family and Casper, she had to grow up in front of the camera and made some red carpet dress choices she now looks back on in horror. 'I was a . 17-year-old fright fest!' she told net-a-porter.com's digital magazine, The Edit, referring to her outfit when she attended the Cannes Film Festival for the first time in 1997. In style: Christina Ricci wears a Temperley London dress in the fashion shoot for net-a-porter . Former child star: The actress said she became more comfortable in her own skin in her twenties. She wears dress by Valentino and shoes by Jimmy Choo, left, and jacket and skirt by Oscar de La Renta, shoes by Christian Louboutin, right . 'I'd dyed my hair blonde for a role . and I was overweight. But then, I don't know anyone who looks back and . says, ""Oh, you should see what I looked like at 17…'"" She added that at that time she wasn't lent designer gowns to wear so instead she picked her own from Barneys. But at the age of 33 with her acting career still going strong, she said she's found her style and now has her pick of the best dresses to wear. In the magazine's shoot with photographer Victor Demarchelier, she models romantic pieces by Alexander McQueen, Oscar de la Renta, Temperley London, Valentino, Alberta Ferretti and Dolce & Gabbana.

It was a gradual thing. As I got older, I became more like my mother. I began to wear what I wanted to wear. 'I'm finding I don’t want to stick to my rigid rules any more.
