"The latest in virtual reality gaming, the Oculus Rift DK2 headset, certainly looks real - at least that's what the security guard's reaction in this video would lead one to believe. Ugandan gaming community GamersNights were recently testing the new product and decided to show a local man exactly what the new wave of gaming is all about. Playing a demo called Cyber Space, which imitates a large pendulum swing (like the ones found at a theme park), the man eagerly donned his goggles to take a spin on the 'ride.' In Uganda, a security guard recently tried out the Oculus Rift DK2 headset - with hilarious results . Gaming community GamersNights were recently testing the new product and gave this man a demo . The man was initially quite shocked at what he was seeing, but within seconds, his reaction changed to utter joy. Fast forward several more seconds however, and on what would seemingly be the downswing motion of the pendulum ride, the security guard finds himself falling head-first onto the floor while grabbing the seat of his chair. The audience and crew immediately burst into laughter, while the man was helped up and dusted off. Thankfully, the guard got a chuckle out of his immersive experience embarrassment, as well. The security guard was testing out Cyber Space - a 'ride' on a pendulum-like swing . Although initially the man was quite surprised by the game, his reaction quickly turned to enjoyment . However, at the part where the pendulum swings downward, the man suddenly fell face-first onto the floor . Oculus Rift is a virtual video game experience, which recently received a large $2 billion dollar investment from Facebook. While demo versions have been making the rounds, a consumer version is still yet untested. However, the virtual reality start-up is believed to have the potential to change the way we work, play, and communicate, according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The crew and audience immediately burst into laughter, as the security guard was clearly not injured . As the demonstrator helped him up and dusted him off, the tester too had a chuckle at his own expense .","Man tested Oculus Rift virtual headset during Ugandan GamersNights filming .

"Satellite images released by NASA show the shocking extent of water shortage in California as it's revealed that some communities have been left without water for five months during the record-breaking drought. The colors in the 'California Drying' images, released by the GRACE program, progress from green to orange then red, showing how much the water storage has dried up in the region since 2002. According to the space agency, California's Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins, including the Central Valley, have suffered the greatest losses. Part of this is due to increased groundwater from reservoirs and rivers being pumped to support agricultural production. Scroll down for video . Satellite images of southern California highlight how much water storage has dried up in the region since 2002 . Between 2011 and 2014, the combined river basins have lost four trillion gallons (15 cubic kilometers, or 12 million acre-feet) of water each year. The amount far exceeds the amount California's 38 million residents use in cities and homes annually. Across the whole of the state, 63 trillion gallons have been lost since 2013 - the equivalent of having the US west of the Rocky Mountains flooded in four inches of water. The drought is now in its third year and has caused rivers to dry up, agricultural land to become untenable and water bills to soar. Around 500 residents in Tulare County have been left without running water for five months. It means they are unable to shower, flush a toilet or fill a glass without getting a bottle or a bucket. Angelica Gallegos, who lives in Porterville, told The New York Times: 'When you wake up in the middle of the night sick to your stomach, you have to think about where the water bottle is before you can use the toilet.' The Gallegos family's drinking water comes only from bottles, mostly received through donations but sometimes bought at the gas station. To wash her children's hair, Mrs Gallegos  has to use water from buckets which Mr Gallegos has to refill from the county's fire station every day. Angelica Gallegos from Porterville, California, uses a container of non-potable water to wash her dishes. She has not had running water for five months and relies on taps or donated water bottles . She has been forced to wash the hair of her daughter, Abagail Beltran, with non-potable water . For showering, washing dishes and flushing toilets, the family relies on buckets filled with water from a tank set in the front lawn, which Mr. Gallegos replenishes every other day at the county fire station. Often, the water runs out before he returns home from his job as a mechanic, forcing Ms. Gallegos to wait for hours before she can clean. The local high school has begun allowing students to arrive early and shower there. The State Water Resources Control Board had already allotted $500,000 to buy bottled water for East Porterville residents, said Bruce Burton of the board's Drinking Water Program. Low water levels are visible from a boat ramp at the San Luis Reservoir  in Gustine, California. As California suffers through a third straight year of drought, the state's reservoirs are at record lows . But many East Porterville residents, like Yolanda Serrato, say all they want is to get a glass of water from the kitchen sink. Her well dried up nearly two months ago, she said, making life challenging for her husband and three children. To bathe, they each have to fill a bucket from a 300-gallon tank in the front yard, carry it inside and pour water over their heads with a cup. They've lived in their home for 21 years, she said. 'It's not that easy to say, ""Let's go someplace else."" ' East Porterville sits along the Tule River, which starts high in the mountains and runs through the unincorporated town. Typically, river water permeates the sandy soil under the community, filling up wells as shallow as 30 feet deep. Not this year. Drought has caused the river to run dry, along with the wells.

"Military top brass yesterday backed calls to keep the Tower of London’s poppies beyond Armistice Day. Former senior Army figures and a decorated war hero added their support to a Daily Mail campaign to extend the poignant tribute to Britain’s First World War dead. Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former Chief of the Defence staff, said he would welcome a decision to keep the poppies until the end of the year, in line with commemorative events. Military top brass have backed calls to keep the Tower of London’s poppies beyond Armistice Day . An online petition calling for the display to be kept at the Tower for a year has already attracted more than 23,000 signatures . He told the Mail: ‘It has been a wonderful focal point for remembering the fallen, I’m all in favour of it. If it … did stay until the end of 2014, that would be marvellous.’ Lord Bramall’s views were echoed by Major General Patrick Cordingley, the commander of the Desert Rats in the 1991 Gulf War. He said: ‘They should be there for as long as possible because it is a magnificent site and remembers the sacrifice of the 888,246 who died fighting for the country.’ Adding his weight to the calls, Major Charles Heyman, a senior defence analyst and editor of Armed Forces of the UK, said: ‘Anybody who has had chance to see the poppies has been struck by them. I would like to see them there for a longer time.’ Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher, who was awarded the George Cross for throwing himself on a Taliban hand grenade in Afghanistan to save his comrades, said: ‘The poppies have been a huge success, attracted millions of visitors and raised millions of pounds. 'I understand people wishing to keep the poppies for longer… I would have to agree.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson said he was keen to explore whether the display could stay in place for longer . More than four million people have already viewed the sea of 888,246 red ceramic flowers which fill the moat . An online petition calling for the display to be kept at the Tower for a year has already attracted more than 23,000 signatures. On Thursday all four main political parties threw their weight behind calls to keep the poppies for at least another week. But last night Tower officials remained adamant that the lengthy job of taking away all the flowers would begin on Wednesday – the day after Armistice Day. They did however announce that the poppies will be floodlit for an extra two and a half hours each day to allow more to view the installation. They will be illuminated from 4.30am until dawn and then from dusk to midnight. Field Marshall Lord Bramall (left) and Major General Patrick Cordingley (right) have backed the Mail's campaign to extend the poppies exhibition at the Tower of London . Today David Cameron will announce that part of the display is to go on a four-year tour of the country before going on permanent display at the Imperial War Museum. And the Weeping Willow and Wave elements of the installation will remain in place until the end of November. The Prime Minister said: ‘The poppy display at the Tower of London has in a very short space of time become a much loved and respected monument. ‘We want to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to witness it, and the government is providing money and working with charities to do so. ‘By displaying parts of the installation around the country and then permanently in the Imperial War Museum, we have ensured that this poignant memorial will be saved for the nation.’ Supported by donations from two charities, the Backstage Trust and the Clore Duffield Foundation, together with government funding, two major parts of the installation, the Weeping Window and The Wave, will go on a journey to sites around the UK until 2018. The Government has agreed to provide £500,000 to cover the cost of storing, transporting and installing the poppy sculptures in towns and cities across the UK. The funding will come from fines on banks who manipulated the Libor interest rates. More than four million people have already viewed the sea of red ceramic flowers. Historic Royal Palaces, the charity which operates the landmark, says 11,000 volunteers will take about two weeks to remove the flowers and post them to their new owners. All 888,246 poppies – one for each British and colonial death during the war – have been sold at £25 each, with part of the estimated £15million proceeds shared between six service charities. A spokesman said: ‘The transience of the installation is key to the artistic concept, with the dispersal of the poppies into hundreds of thousands of homes marking the final phase of this evolving installation.’","The Daily Mail is calling to extend the poignant tribute at Tower of London .

The team has already spent a good two years hard at work in the company's assembly facility building the ship, dubbed SpaceShipTwo Serial No. 2, which will now replace the destroyed version. According to Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides, this new ship could be tested in as soon as six months. 'There was no question it was a tragic setback, but it's one from which we can recover,' said Whitesides. 'With Serial No. 2, we'll be putting a stronger, even better ship into initial commercial service and I think we'll be able to get back into test flights soon and carry forward.' In the meantime, the team at Virgin will still be able to fly and test their mother ship WhiteKnightTwo, as federal investigators look into the cause of Friday's deadly crash.

"Senator John Faulkner says the late Gough Whitlam was a great friend and mentor who he regularly shared a 'cuppa or glass of Passiona' with. The federal Labour caucus gathered in Canberra on Tuesday morning to remember the former prime minister who passed away aged 98. Mr Faulkner, who joined the party when Whitlam was opposition leader, said his condolence speech to the caucus was the most difficult he had ever made. Scroll down for video . Senator John Faulkner said his condolence speech to the caucus on Tuesday about his friend Gough Whitlam was the most difficult he had ever made . 'Gough Whitlam was a towering figure in our lives and in our party,' he said. 'Gough and I were close for more years than I care to remember. When I was in Sydney I would go and have a cuppa or a glass of Passiona with Gough in his office. He came into that office four days a week until the last week or two of his life. 'He was so ambitious for our party and so ambitious for Australia. He was an inspiration to a generation of Australians - I'm one of them. 'He was a great parliamentarian, a great leader, a great Australian and, for so many of us and it's what makes it so hard, he was a great friend and mentor.' Gough Whitlam, who passed away on Tuesday morning aged 98, has been described by his Labor colleagues as a 'towering figure' The former prime minister's photograph was clearly visible on a wall in Canberra behind Labor caucus members who had gathered to remember him . Faulkner told the story of Mr Whitlam's reaction when a documentary the pair had made to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1972 election was nominated for a Logie. When Senator Faulkner passed on the news that the Logie had gone to another film, Mr Whitlam was 'crestfallen for at least five seconds'. 'He said to me: 'Comrade, I suppose an academy award is out of the question?'. 'In that film, as he often did, Gough talked for many hours about his life, career, goals and hopes for Australia. 'One thing he always kept returning to time and again, and we should never forget this, was his belief that politics was an honourable profession.' Senator Penny Wong consoled her colleague John Faulkner as he gave a moving speech about Whitlam . Tasmanian Senator Lisa Singh wiped away tears as Mr Faulkner shared stories of Whitlam's political career . Labor MP Kate Ellis was visibly upset as her colleagues remembered Gough Whitlam as a friend and mentor . Mr Faulkner spoke of his first election campaign back when Whitlam swept to power. 'My first election campaign as a very active young party member was in 1972 when 23 years of conservative government was swept away and of course ""It's Time"" became part of our language,' he said. 'I will never forget the excitement and the enthusiasm of that election and neither will so many others who... knew that the surging tide of Labor support was not only about a change of government but about changing the country for the better.' Labor leader Bill Shorten told the caucus on Tuesday that Whitlam had maintained a 'certain grandeur' to the end. 'Gough's was a truly Australian life and a life lived truly for Australia - be it in uniform, or in parliament, in the prime ministership and around the world,' he said. 'Gough did not just want to serve our nation, he wanted to transform it utterly and permanently and he most certainly did.' Labor leader Bill Shorten told the caucus on Tuesday that Whitlam maintained a 'certain grandeur' to the end . Bill Shorten and John Faulkner agreed Whitlam was an ambitious force for Australia . Whitlam, who was a caucus member for 26 years, re-imagined Australia as a 'prosperous, modern, multicultural nation where opportunity belonged to everyone'. Despite the sacking of his government in 1975, the former prime minister did not carry an 'anvil of hatred'. 'In defending tolerance and defending democracy, Whitlam defined his character and his values and our nation's,' Mr Shorten said. Reflecting on the famous 'It's Time' election campaign, Mr Shorten said it was always time for being more generous and inclusive. 'It's always time for courage and leadership to create and seize opportunity.' The caucus passed a resolution marking the life of the former prime minister and stood for a minute's silence.","Federal Labor caucus met in Canberra to remember Gough Whitlam following his passing on Tuesday morning .

"The death of a special-needs Texas girl whose body weighing only 14lbs was found crammed inside a refrigerator in June has been ruled a homicide. A medical examiner has determined that the primary cause of death of 9-year-old Ayahana Comb was a combination of malnutrition and dehydration. By the time her 5-year-old sister found Ayahana's body wrapped in a blanket inside a refrigerator drawer in the family's apartment in Houston, the child had been dead for five months. 'Murdered': Ayahana Comb, 9, died from a combination of malnutrition and dehydration in January before her mother wrapped her body in a blanket and stuffed it inside her fridge . Comb had cerebral palsy, was wheelchair-bound and had to be bottle-fed. A neighbor at the Happy Home Apartments in Houston, who was concerned that he hadn't seen Ayahana in a few months, went to check on the family in June. He found the front door unlocked and no one at home, so he went inside and discovered the little girl's emaciated body in a refrigerator drawer. But he was not the first to make the shocking discovery. According to investigators, Ayahana's younger sister came upon her body earlier that month while looking for a cheese snack in the fridge. According to KHOU, her mother Amber Keys told police that her daughter stopped breathing one night in January and although she tried CPR, she was unable to save her and then did not know what to do with the body. A Child Protective Services case worker revealed during a court hearing that Keys had admitted to placing her child's corpse inside the fridge back in January out of panic. However, the mother continued collecting Social Security Disability payments and food stamps for Ayahana long after her death, Click 2 Houston reported. The Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office found that Ayahana's malnutrition and dehydration were compounded by medical complications associated with cerebral palsy and ulcers that had infected her bones. The little girl's mother Amber Keys told police that her daughter stopped breathing one night in January and that she could not resuscitate her. The mother said she did not know what to do with the body . Traumatic experience: Ayahana's 5-year-old sister (left) came upon the child's body in the fridge while searching for a cheese snack. Amber Keys (far right) later lost custody of her younger daughter . Ms Keys has a criminal record, which includes a year-long stint in prison in 1998 for drug possession. She was also arrested in 2000 for criminal trespass and sentenced to 30 days in jail. The woman had an older daughter, but she lost custody of her and the girl was later put up for adoption. Following Ayahana's death, the state removed Keys' 5-year-old daughter from her care and placed her with relatives. So far, Amber Keys has not been charged in connection to Ayahana's death. Kathi Combs, the girl's grandmother, told KHOU back in June: 'It's devastating to everyone. We loved her. All loved her.'","Ayahana Comb's body was discovered at the Happy Home Apartments in Houston, Texas in June .

"I like to think of myself as relatively quick-witted, but I started having serious doubts about my cleverness as I stood handcuffed to my new Russian friend, trying get out of a prison cell. It wasn't a real prison cell, which is why I wasn't having a panic attack. But the handcuffs were real, and being chained to another person while searching a small room for keys and clues as a clock ticked down became frustrating pretty quickly. Believe it or not, this was all part of a game. Real-life room escape attractions began opening nearly a decade ago in Asia and Eastern Europe, but they've been popping up in North America over the past few years. Konstantin Elizarov (left) and Lucy Omelchenko (right) are handcuffed together as they prepare to play a game at Escape the Quest in Miami Beach, Florida . Alex Belousov, left, and  writer David Fischer try to unlock a box as they play a game at Escape the Quest . The attractions trace their origins back to escape-the-room video games, where players were trapped and forced to use clues and objects in their surroundings to get out. Now that concept has moved into the real world. Escape the Quest opened in Miami Beach in July. They offer two games — Apartment 101 and Prison Escape — with Mental Hospital coming soon. Groups of two to four have an hour to solve the puzzle and win their freedom. I participated in Prison Escape, joining a group of expat Russians in their mid-20s — Alex Belousov, Konstantin Elizarov and Lucy Omelchenko — who moved to South Florida within the past two years. Their English was heavily accented, and my Russian is nonexistent, adding a language barrier to a challenge that only about 20 percent of groups complete successfully, according to Escape the Quest manager Yuliya Pashkevich. As Konstantin later remarked, 'You don't understand us, and we understand 50 percent of yours.' So we were off to a good start. Konstantin Elizarov (left), Lucy Omelchenko (center), and Alex Belousov (right) pose for photos in prison garb in the Miami Beach game Apartment 101 . Konstantin Elizarov and Lucy Omelchenko prepare to play a game at Escape the Quest while handcuffed together in Miami Beach . To begin, Pashkevich explained that Prison Escape actually includes two rooms and that my new friends and I would be paired off, one pair locked in each room. We would first have to get all four into one room and then all escape together. Alex spoke the best English, so he went with me. We were all handcuffed to our partners and locked in our cells. I promised Pashkevich I wouldn't give away any secrets, but I will say Alex and I did eventually find a handcuff key, probably much later than we should have. By working with Konstantin and Lucy through a wall, we even managed to get them into our room. And by briefly speaking in their native tongue, Alex and Konstantin figured out a math riddle that set us free with about 5 minutes to spare. I felt useless at that final math part, but even the third-string quarterback gets a ring when his team wins the Super Bowl, so I'm counting it as a win. After escaping, Alex, Konstantin and Lucy donned old-timey, black-and-white prisoner outfits for a photo op. They agreed they had fun and that it was a unique experience they'd recommend to others. Konstantin Elizarov looks for clues how to open the small door as he plays a game at Escape the Quest . Yuliya Pashkevich, manager of the Escape the Quest, poses at the attraction in Miami Beach, Florida . 'It was the first time seeing something like this,' Konstantin said. 'It was very good.' Pashkevich said the escapes, which start at $60 a group, were designed to appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds. Besides groups of friends, Pashkevich said it's also common to host families and even co-workers using it for team-building. But she added the potentially stressful room escapes can be poison to a budding romance. 'You know when it doesn't work?' Pashkevich said. 'On a first date.' While room escape attractions are more stressful than actually scary, they're catching the attention of more traditional haunted house operators and theme parks. Brett Hays, a board member of the Haunted Attraction Association and director of Fear Fair in Indiana, said he expects room escapes to feature prominently at a national trade show in St. Louis next spring. 'You're going to see a lot of overlap, where companies and individuals doing haunted attractions are also going to be doing these types of events in the off season,' Hays said, adding that room escapes can be popular year-round, not just around Halloween. The challenge of room escape attractions is volume. 'You have to get a lot of people through in a night to make the finances work,' Hays said. But traditional haunted attractions often feature multiple events, which could easily include a room escape, Hays said. Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services, Inc., believes the room escape concept can be modified to accommodate more participants. 'We see it as something that will come into the parks bigtime,' Speigel said. 'It will come in on a larger scale. You'll have large teams of people coursing through different games.' Theme parks are always looking for new ideas, Speigel said, and the critical thinking and interactivity featured in room escapes is appealing. 'The concept is limitless to the story,' Speigel said. 'So as long you have creative people, this can go on forever.'","Real-life room escapes originated from escape-the-room video games .

"China is building the world's first hack-proof computer network in a bid to give it the edge in its cyberwar against the West, it has been reported. A £60million fibre-optic cable between Beijing and Shanghai is being developed that will secure government, financial and military information from eavesdroppers. The network will be up and running in two years time and will transmit quantum encryption keys to keep information safe. China is said to be building the world's first hack-proof computer network, top stop eavesdroppers it has been reported (file picture) It is being funded by the central government and at first will be used for money transfers by ICBC, the world's largest bank. The project is being led by Professor Pan Jianwei, a quantum physicist at the Unversity of Science and Technology of China (USTC). He told the Telegraph: 'We learnt after the Edward Snowden affair that we are always being hacked. 'Since most of the products we buy come from foreign companies, we wanted to accelerate our own programme. This is very urgent because classical encryption was not invented in China, so we want to develop our own technology.' Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) – delivers private data using the smallest possible packets of light. If the line tries to be tapped into, it will disturb the encoding and will be detected, providing security. The news comes after a a representative study on internet attack traffic has revealed that China is the country where the largest number of attacks originate. By monitoring connections on the web it was shown that 43 per cent of online attacks originated in China, more than three times Indonesia in second place with 15 per cent. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) – delivers private data using the smallest possible packets of light (file picture) And the researchers add that general internet users can keep themselves safe by frequently updating their software. The attacks in the study refer to attempts by a computer to connect to specific ports on the internet, which would indicate a hacked or infected computer that was trying to connect to other computers. Akamai’s David Belson, Editor of the report, explains to MailOnline that the results should not be taken as a view of the Internet as a whole, but rather only as representative findings. ‘We’re basically saying from the systems we’ve got out there, 43 per cent of the attacks we observe are coming from China,’ he says. When asked if he’d expect similar results if every connection on the internet was monitored, he says: ‘It’s hard to say if they’d be similar.

One of the four friends lucked out and now Vino is on a strict all-carb diet. 'I'm not looking to become famous or anything. I'm just a dude who loves to eat and to write,' he told MailOnline. Now for the 49 days his card is valid, Vino, who works in a laboratory, plans to try the more than 150 combinations of pasta, sauce and toppings the restaurant offers. 'On this site, I will document my journey - the friendships I create and destroy, the changes my body goes through as it adjusts to a purely carbohydrate-based diet,' Vino writes on the blog. 'Spaghetti & An Entire Sausage' has probably been Vino's least creative name for a pasta dish so far. It consists of spaghetti with marinara  'superbly covered in Italian Sausage'  (Calorie count: 765) Appetizing? Vino ate this combination of angel hair pasta, alfredo sauce and two meatballs he calls 'Stouffer's' on day two of the project (Calorie count: 1,300) So much cheese: This colorful monstrosity is nicknamed 'Cheesetube Extreme' by Vino, and consists of penne topped with a rich five cheese marinara sauce (Calorie count: 760) 'On the lighter side': Vino's 'Asian Buffet' of fettuccine, marinara and two meatballs has been one of his 'healthiest' meals yet (Calorie count: 740) While his body didn't initially take well to the severe increase in sodium, Vino says the challenge is now going 'surprisingly well' as he balances out the empty calories of his pasta meals with servings of salad. 'Things looked grim at first - I had pretty severe side effects from all the food and sodium. But as I found my balance of portion control and eating salad alongside the pasta, those effects subsided and now I feel healthy and alert!' he said. Pasta (average calories: 416) Angel Hair: 460 . Cavatappi: 440 . Fettucini: 430 . Penne: 390 . Spaghetti: 400 . Whole Wheat Linguini: 380 . Sauce (average calories: 406) Alfredo Sauce: 660 . Five Cheese Marinara Sauce: 370 . Marinara Sauce: 130 . Meat Sauce: 300 . Roasted Mushroom Alfredo Sauce: 600 . Spicy Three Meat: 380 . Meat (average calories: 265) Chicken Fritta: 240 . Two Italian Sausages: 470 . Two Meatballs: 180 . Shrimp Fritta: 170 . TOTAL AVERAGE CALORIES:  1,087 . Those problems surfaced as early as day three, when Vino wrote that 'there are certain things man was not meant to eat.' 'Today, my body made it quite clear to me that ""Nothing but pasta, forever,"" is near the top of that list. I will spare you the details, but suffice to say it will take some time for equilibrium to be re-established and for me to restore order among the bacterial fauna of my gut,' he wrote. While Vino eats a bowl of pasta for lunch, and orders three for dinner, he insists that he doesn't actually lick the plates clean. Rather, he eats a small portion for lunch, two full bowls for dinner and just a small helping of the fourth and final bowl. The rest he kindly takes home to share with his sister. 'So far I haven't gotten bored. There's a surprising amount of subtle differences amongst the menu items once you start looking for them,' Vino said. At the end of each day, Vino posts pictures of the day's meals along with reviews of the different combinations, which he gives clever names like 'Asian Buffet', 'Regret', and 'Cheesetube Extreme' which described a plate of penne drenched in cheese marinara sauce. The pasta pass project has already been rife with drama, after just one week. On day six, Vino had to explain to the new manager of his Olive Garden, that the pasta pass entitles card holders to unlimited to go orders. That matter was eventually cleared up. And on day five, Vino brought a  date to dinner and she seemed less than impressed by his pasta pass status. But at the end of day seven, Vino is filled with enthusiasm for the weeks ahead. 'Life seems full of color, the future seems full of possibility, and I seem full of pasta,' Vino writes. Seafood: Vino calls this plate 'Catch of the Baltic', and it includes curly cavatappi pasta and marinara with a topping of fried shrimp (Calorie count: 740)","A man named Vino has started a blog chronicling his seven-week challenge to try every type of pasta dish combination at Olive Garden .
He is one of 1,000 recipients of the restaurant's $100 'pasta pass', which entitles cardholders to as much pasta and bread-sticks as they want ."
"This is the terrifying moment a lone British sailor was left clinging to the wreckage of his yacht in the dark after it was damaged in a storm. Mick Royton, 52, was left stranded almost 40 miles from land when his trimaran boat lost its mast in heavy weather and was in danger of capsizing in rough seas. He made a desperate mayday radio call to emergency services after a log was washed into the yacht, breaking one of its three hulls and damaging the other. Lone British sailor Mick Royton was found clinging to the wreckage of his yacht (pictured) in the dark after it was damaged in a storm off the south coast of the Isle of Wight . A helicopter and a boat come to the aid of Mick Royton following a major air and sea search operation to the south of the Isle of Wight . To stop the boat from breaking up completely, Mr Royton cut the mast and rigging down from the boat before putting a wetsuit on to stay warm in the horrendous conditions. A major air and sea search was launched for Mr Royton, whose original position was 37 miles south of the Isle of Wight. Two coastguard helicopters and two offshore lifeboats were dispatched to search a 250 square mile area but rescuers were forced to call off the hunt as the weather worsened. The stricken yacht was chanced upon at around 4am yesterday by naval frigate HMS St Albans which was on its way to its home port of Portsmouth from Plymouth. At this point, he had been drifting for about 12 hours. Lookouts spotted the severely damaged yacht, called Kinetic, languishing around 30 miles from its original position. The boat had drifted and was 18 miles south of Portland Bill in Dorset when it was discovered. HMS St Albans, a 436ft warship, was used as a wind shield while lifeboat crews from Weymouth plucked Mr Royton from his damaged boat. Mr Royton, who is currently unemployed, had been sailing from Lannion in Brittany, France, to Poole, Dorset, when he got into difficulties. He was taken to Weymouth then rushed to Dorset County Hospital in nearby Dorchester suffering from hypothermia. Mick Royton (pictured) was left stranded almost 40 miles from land when his trimaran boat lost its mast in heavy weather and was in danger of capsizing in rough seas . Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Royton said: 'I was just very grateful to get off the boat at that time because the wind was picking up and big waves could have sunk it. I still could have died from hypothermia. 'I feel a bit battered and tired but I feel okay. 'I set off from Lannion, France at dusk on Sunday. I sailed south past Guernsey. The wind was picking up all the time and so did the waves. 'When my canoe got washed over the side, I decided to take the jib down and have a rest. 'I tied the canoe up and had a cup of coffee. I was debating whether to carry on sailing. 'All of a sudden there was a loud bang and a very big wave with a log hit both the floaters breaking one in half and seriously damaging the other. 'I decided in order to lengthen the period of time between the next one breaking and falling off I needed to get the mast down. 'It wasn't until the next afternoon that the other floater started to sink. 'I had already taken the precaution of putting a wetsuit on. 'I thought the boat was going to flip over and sink.' The stricken yacht was chanced upon at around 4am yesterday by naval frigate HMS St Albans (file picture) which was on its way to its home port of Portsmouth from Plymouth . Catherine Jordan (pictured) was the commanding officer on HMS St Albans during the rescue operation . Despite his ordeal, Mr Royton, from Brighton, said he had not been put off sailing and he was already forming plans to recover his yacht. He added: 'I hope to go out and find my boat but if not I shall build another one.' Catherine Jordan, commanding officer of HMS St Albans, said: 'We initially responded to reports of a capsized trimaran with an unknown number of people onboard. 'Weather conditions were initially very difficult but this gradually improved as the night went on and eventually the moon broke the cloud cover which provided us with good illumination. 'Following a search of over 250 square nautical miles at 0315 an unlit yacht with no mast and significant damage was spotted by the bridge team some 30 miles from the original mayday position. 'The weather at this point deteriorated again and due to the difficult sea state and fragile condition of the yacht we were only able to close the distance, provide a windbreak, and offer reassurance until the lifeboat arrived. 'The sailor was quite disorientated - he had been drifting since about 4pm the previous day.' Andy Sergeant, the coxswain for Weymouth lifeboat, added: 'He was very lucky to have been found.'","Mick Royton was stranded 40 miles from land when his boat lost its mast .

"Veteran actor Leslie Phillips has been told he can leave hospital – seven weeks after suffering a stroke on a London bus . Veteran actor Leslie Phillips has been told he can leave hospital – seven weeks after suffering a stroke on a London bus. And the 90-year-old, best known for his line ‘I say, ding dong!’ in Carry On Nurse, joked that there was still time for him to be knighted – adding to his CBE and OBE. He said: ‘Yes, I want the hat-trick. I think I deserve it. 'I'm the longest-serving actor in Britain, having spent the last eight decades in films and on stage. 'That's not a bad feat, is it?' Phillips will have to wait another two weeks before he leaves hospital as his £4million home is adapted for the wheelchair he will initially have to use. He paid tribute to his third wife Zara, 55, whom he married last year and who has rarely left his bedside at the National Hospital for Neurology in Central London. He said: ‘I doubt I would have got to the point I’m at today without her.’ She has spent 10 hours every day at his bedside caring for him since doctors praised her for saving his life. She was responsible for stopping the bus and getting him the prompt treatment he needed - despite him begging her not to make a fuss. Mrs Phllips, 55, is overjoyed that her prayers for his recovery have been answered and that they can spend more time together. 'He's a wonderful man,' she said. 'It's little wonder that myself and thousands of his fans love him the way we do.' Phillips spoke strongly and firmly yesterday - in marked contrast to the immediate aftermath of the stroke. Initially it badly affected his ability to talk. He is still unable to eat solid food, his meals have to be liquidised and spoon-fed to him. Leslie Phillips and female co-stars at photocall for TV programme 'Casanova' He admitted that while he was grateful for all the medical care and attention he had received in hospital, he couldn't wait to go home. Piles of get-well cards have been sent from all over the world. He has received many phone calls and visits from both friends and family. He said that while the last few weeks had been 'hell', his return to health had made him fully appreciate life and happiness. 'I need to work to keep the brain active,' he added. 'If only to try to inspire the elderly about how illnesses can be overcome. 'I'm so fortunate having Zara in my life. She's been at my side every day and I doubt I would have got to the point I'm at today without her.' His health scare has not dimmed his sense of humour. Yesterday, after a slight coughing fit, he joked: 'It's not the coughing that kills you, it's the coffin that takes you away.'","Actor best known for line 'I say, ding dong!' in Carry on Nurse .

"Long-hailed as a role model to Britain, France’s much-lauded high speed TGV trains are ‘running out of steam’ according to a damning report by French financial watchdogs. Some 33 years after the launch of the first TGV - Train à Grande Vitesse or ‘high speed train’ - 40 per cent of the trains still travel on conventional track rather than the specially built high-speed lines. Watchdogs say the system often fails to meet its key stated aims on what is described as an ‘incoherent’ network. 'Running out of steam': Watchdogs say the high-speed rail network often fails to meet its key stated aims on what is described as an ‘incoherent’ network. Above, a file picture of a TGV train . These are ‘to link large population centres, within one and a half to three hours, few or no intermediate stops, a frequent service, a high user rate and good connections to other forms of transport’. The report will make alarming reading for the UK Government on the day it announced its own ambitious new plans for an East to West high speed rail – dubbed HS3 – in addition to the already controversial planned HS2. France’s Audit Office  blamed local authorities for pressuring the state to allow the TGV to pass through their towns, creating an ‘incoherent’ network. As a result, there are now a total 230 TGV stations across France, many on lines which are loss-making for the state-run SNCF company. In the UK cities like Stoke and Liverpool have also been pressing to be part of Britain’s high speed network, with Sheffield wanting a stop in the city centre rather than at the Meadowhall out-of-town shopping centre. Alarming: The report was released a day after the UK Government announced its own plans for an East to West high speed rail – dubbed HS3. Above, David Cameron pictured today after a conference on the rail network . France’s Audit Office highlighted a steady drop in TGV profitability since 2008. Decision-making processes are only ‘partly rational’ in the cases of the Tours-Bordeaux line, which is due to open in 2017 at an estimated cost of £7billion. £7billion is also the mooted cost of the Northern HS3 route from Liverpool to Hull via Manchester and Leeds. French auditors recommended a gradual reduction in the number of TGV stops, improved planning and greater transparency with passenger statistics. France’s state-owned rail operator SNCF is already considering closing some stations. But a French business website says the rail company is also considering increasing first class fares and putting restrictions on ticket refunds and exchanges in standard class, and axing the buffet car, in a bid to restore profitability. The French rail users’ association vice-chairman Jean Lenoir, told Le Parisien on Sunday that axing high speed stations was “going in the wrong direction’ and would complicate things for the traveller’. It would also be ‘scandalous’ if SNCF changed its ticket policy and scrapped the buffet cars, he said.","Report claims France's high-speed rail system often fails to meet its key aims .

"This is the astonishing story of how nine British brothers fought in the First World War and survived. The Hanscombe brothers from Beckenham, south-east London, all volunteered to fight in the war - and they were shot, gassed, blown up and taken prisoner in France, but all returned home alive. Their mother Sara - who was a widow when the war began in 1914 and also had a daughter - saw eight of her sons go off to the front line in Europe, while a ninth served in England. Hero family: Eight of the Hanscombe brothers were (from top left, clockwise) Frank, David, Stephen, George, Frederick, James, Bert and Joseph. Richard is not pictured, but their mother Sara can be seen above (centre) 'Gratified': This letter shows how King George V congratulated Mrs Hanscombe on her family's patriotism . The men’s story has been compared to World War Two film Saving Private Ryan, which sees U.S. soldiers go behind enemy lines to retrieve a paratrooper whose three brothers have been killed. Speaking to journalist Sheron Boyle in the Sunday Mirror, the mother’s great-grandson Roy Hanscombe, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ‘Saving Private Ryan was a very moving story. ‘But it has nothing on what my family endured. My grandfather, James, and his brothers survived the war but they didn’t escape unscathed, suffering a total of 21 wounds. ‘Many large families fought in the war but I have never heard of any where all survived - my great grandmother was lucky. Someone must have been looking down on her.’ One of nine brothers: Sergeant Bert Hanscombe won the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal . Local hero: Bert Hanscombe worked as a council dustman and unveiled the Beckenham War Memorial in 1921 . One of the brothers, Sergeant Bert Hanscombe, who won the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal, worked as a council dustman and unveiled his town’s war memorial in 1921. He was promoted to sergeant for his bravery at Hulluch during the Battle of Loos in France in 1915, and was one of seven men in his battalion to escape German capture at Cambrai two years later. Another brother, George, was a 36-year-old father-of-seven when the war began, and in 1917 he was listed as missing - but it turned out he had been shot in the hip and taken prisoner in Germany. James was wounded in the head in 1916 then again in 1917, but survived both attacks. And Richard was known for running messages to battalion headquarters at Nieppe Forest under heavy shellfire.

First World War: A file photograph of soldiers going 'over the top' during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 . According to military expert Stuart Hallifax - who has researched the brothers - Mrs Hanscombe received a letter on behalf of King George V to thank her for the patriotic effort made by her family. And she said in a newspaper interview in 1918: ‘I never believed they would all come back’ However, Mr Hallifax wrote on his Great War London blog: ‘Sadly, Sarah Ann Hanscombe did not live to see her son acting as a local VIP in unveiling the local war memorial. She died in early 1920. ‘All of her sons who had served in the war survived it though. Unfortunately, David - who appears to have been the only one to remain a soldier - was killed in action in Waziristan in May 1922 though.’","Hanscombe brothers from south-east London all volunteered to fight in war .

"A plan to force mobile phone giants to share masts to plug signal blackspots could put the fight against terrorism at risk, Theresa May has warned. Barely 24 hours after being accused of being 'uncollegiate', it emegred that the Home Secretary is opposing Tory Culture Secretary Sajid Javid's attempts to eliminate poor signals that leave millions of us unable to make calls or use the internet. He wants to force the four major networks – EE, Vodafone, O2 and Three – to act through a change in the law. Home Secretary Theresa May has come out against a plan by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to force mobile companies to share masts to boost por signals . Mrs May has written to the Prime Minister and other senior ministers to warn that the proposals could have a 'detrimental impact on law enforcement'. The letter, leaked to The Times, said the plans could interfere with the police's ability to listen to calls and read emails, which she said is ‘vital to protecting the public from crime and terrorism’. The rift between Ms May and Mr Javid - both seen as potential future Tory leadership candidates - comes just months after a major row between the Home Secretary and Michael Gove, the then education secretary over radicalism in schools. Yesterday Lib Dem minister Norman Baker quit the Home Office, claiming working with Mrs May was like 'walking through mud' and her management style 'did not make for good relations'. Mr Javid is considering a system of ‘national roaming’ that would allow phone users to hop between different networks. It would mean a phone call is transferred to the nearest mobile phone mast, even if it is run by a rival company to the one the caller is signed up to. This is similar to what already happens when you use your phone abroad. Another option is to force so-called ‘infrastructure sharing’, which would allow mobile networks to put transmitters on each other’s masts. The Government is also to consider imposing a new legally binding coverage obligation, requiring networks to cover a certain percentage of the UK. So-called ‘not spots’, where there is no signal at all, are mostly in remote, rural communities. Partial not-spots, where one provider might provide a signal, but others do not, are much more widespread – affecting 20 per cent of the country in terms of geography. Mr Javid will also suggest reforms to packages sold by companies such as Tesco and Virgin, who currently agree access to a single network and then sell mobiles to consumers. The Government could ensure third-party firms are able to offer devices that can access all four networks. However, the proposals in the consultation will trigger an angry backlash from mobile phone companies, who say they have funded the costs of erecting masts themselves and do not want to share them with rivals. A new study by Open Signal shows that in some areas users have a 3G phone signal barely half of the time . Mr Javid said: ‘I see this as a national utility that we should all be able to use. It’s not just about lifestyle, it’s absolutely vital for a modern economy. ‘In the UK, at a national level, we don’t have roaming. So a French person coming to Wales gets a better signal that someone does as a local. It is such a big problem that something needs to be done.’ Under the plan, phone users would switch between the masts of different companies to ensure they keep a signal . Ms May's letter, sent to David Cameron and other Cabinet ministers, said two of the proposed options, including national roaming, ‘could have a detrimental impact on law enforcement, security and intelligence agency access to communications data and lawful intercept’. She also raised objections to the option of allowing Tesco to sell phones that access all four networks, and called for further studies to make sure that the changes do not stop police from accessing ‘information that is crucial to keeping us safe’. Ms May argues that their ability to listen to calls and read emails is ‘vital to protecting the public from crime and terrorism’. The Home Secretary does not spell out the technical issues that could undermine interception of calls but it is thought that roaming would significantly complicate agencies’ ability to track suspects. So-called ‘not spots’, where there is no signal at all, are mostly in remote, rural communities. Partial not-spots, where one provider might provide a signal, but others do not, are much more widespread – affecting 20 per cent of the country in terms of geography. Last night a spokesman for the Home Office said they did not comment on 'leaked letters'. Meanwhile, the speeds of the new ‘super-fast’ 4G mobile phone services have slowed dramatically since they were launched two years ago, it has been revealed. So many people have signed up, often at a premium price, that the system has become congested as users try to surf the web. Despite mobile phone companies promising they would be five times faster, Britain’s 4G speed is less than three times faster than the current average for the 3G network, according to a report by consumer group Which? and industry experts at OpenSignal. Mobile phone firms have been trying to increase the capacity of the 4G system by putting up thousands of masts.","Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to unveil plans to force major networks to act .

"Wrapped up against the cold and clutching one of his favourite toys, brain cancer patient Ashya King waved from his wheelchair today after his final session of proton therapy treatment. But the five-year-old, who has been treated in  Prague for six weeks, will not return to Britain because his parents do not feel 'safe' enough to return. The Kings sparked an international manhunt when Ashya was taken from Southampton General Hospital because they believed NHS treatment would have left him deaf, blind and brain damaged. They were traced to Spain where at the request of the British authorities Ashya's parents were put in a prison and the five-year-old held in hospital under armed guard with no family allowed to see him. His father Brett said today: 'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe contemplating being in England. 'There is so much still at stake. We wouldn't want to lose Ashya. It would probably never happen but just having that small risk that you don't have to do anything wrong to have your children taken away and be thrown in prison'. Brave: Ashya King waves as he leaves the thirtieth and last of the proton treatment sessions at the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague, Czech Republic today . Proud: Ashya's mother Naghmeh smiled as her son posed for pictures outside the Czech hospital unit . Care: Paramedics lifted the five-year-old into an ambulance and is set to start a new life in Spain because Britain is not 'safe', his parents say . Ashya was eventually allowed to be treated at the Czech Proton Therapy Center (PTC). Doctors today said the five-year-old has responded well to therapy but has not fully recovered as he took the last of 30 sessions of the therapy at a clinic in Prague. But Mr King said today they will head to Spain, not back to Hampshire. Fears: Mr King, holding his son, said that they fear the authorities would take Ashya from them . Speaking while holding his son, Mr King told Sky News: 'After some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to Spain. 'We have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us. 'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe, I suppose you would call it, contemplating being in England until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us. 'Once that has been established then we can think about going back to England. But for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in Spain so we are continuing with (Ashya's) treatment in Spain instead of England.' Iva Tatounova from the clinic told Sky News: 'We always thought Ashya would benefit from the specialist treatment here at the PTC. 'And whilst he is still not fully recovered, he's responded very well to the proton beam therapy and there is no reason that he will not continue to get stronger once he leaves here. 'I don't know if you remember the pictures when he was transported here - just lying on his bed in the ambulance. 'Now he can sit on his own, he can play with the toys and his motorics improved dramatically. He can also react to his surroundings.' The treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams, but NHS guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment. Last treatment: Brett and Naghemeh King with their son Ashya, 5, who will have his final round of proton beam therapy at a clinic in Prague today . Five-year-old brain cancer patient Ashya King was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted by his brother . Five-year-old cancer patient Ashya King  was seen for the first time since undergoing brain tumour treatment - on a family trip to a pizza restaurant with his older brother Naveed . Ashya was recently filmed on his first outing to the park with his family since he started his treatment in the Czech Republic. The little boy can be seen smiling as he is gently lifted out of his pushchair in the Prague playground by his older brother Naveed, who then sits with him on a rocking toy while carefully supporting his head. The footage, uploaded by Naveed, 20, then shows him playing with a giggling Ashya on a toy digger - much to the little boy's delight. It is apparently the first time that the seriously ill boy has been able to go to the park with his family since he started being treated in the Czech Republic. He was also pictured at a pizza restaurant clutching a favourite toy and looking healthier than he has done for weeks in an image also shared by his older brother. Ashya's parents removed him from Southampton General Hospital without the permission of doctors  and took him to Southern Spain where they planned to sell a holiday home to fund the alternative treatment. Brett and Naghmeh claimed that they were threatened by the authorities about seeking alternative treatment. After his treatment in Prague ends today they are unlikely to return to the UK and continue his treatment in Spain. Poignant: Ashya clutching his favourite toy as he started another round of treatment in Prague . University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust have repeatedly said they absolutely refute the suggestion that the King family was threatened. After being tracked down they were arrested and thrown into a Spanish jail for three nights. They were released following a public outcry and reunited with Ashya who had been removed and put into a hospital in Malaga. Ashya previously had major surgery to remove a brain tumour on 24 July and a further operation on his brain on 22 August. Mr and Mrs King faced a legal battle to get their child to Prague after removing Ashya from hospital on August 28, with a High Court judge approving the move after they had been released from police custody in Spain. Ashya's 30 visits to the Proton Therapy Centre had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine, to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread, and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was.","Ashya King, 5, had the last of his 30 treatments in Prague this morning .

It wasn't a sad day when Vaso Pavlovic received a  letter at his New York home from the Social Security Administration offering condolences for the loss of his mother-in-law. It was a confusing one. Confusing because his mother-in-law, Kosara Mladenovic, is very much still alive. A keystroke error resulted in the agency declaring Mladenovic dead when it was her husband, Pavlovic's father-in-law, who recently passed away,CBS New York reports. After declaring her dead, the administration reportedly cut off her monthly benefits, which the family uses to support Mladenovic, paying her nursing home expenses. 'They just killed a woman by putting a check sign next to her,' Pavlovic told CBS NY. This kind of situation is not uncommon. CBS NY reports that about 14,000 people a year experience a situation similar to Pavlovic's. However, although the situation is easy to get into, it is rather difficult to get out of. Pavlovic said that to fix the administration's error, he has to prove his mother-in-law is alive. This is no simple task. Pavlovic told CBS NY that in order to correct the mistake he must present a photo of Mladenovic holding newspapers with the day's date on them, he must present a statement from her nursing home confirming she is a tenant, he must present his father-in-law's death certificate as well as his obituary in the local newspaper. Benefits: Vaso Pavlovic, Mladenovic's son-in-law, said the agency cut off Mladenovic's benefits which the family uses to support her . Elder care advocate Gideon Schein told CBS NY that mistakes like this are very difficult to correct. 'It is much harder to undo a keystroke mistake than it is to do it,” Schein said. “It’s pretty complicated...social Security is our everything. If that gets somehow misused, we’re in terrible trouble, so they’re very careful and I do understand that.' In a statement, the agency said that requiring proof of identification is a security measure to protect against potential fraud and identity theft. The agency told CBS NY that after hearing about Pavlovic's situation, the agency took immediate steps to correct the situation.

"It is one of the wonders of nature - thousands of starlings acting together as a single living creature, and yet no-one really knows why. The extraordinary displays - called murmurations - often produce a variety of recognisable shapes with tens of thousands of birds gathering together to fly in unison. The reason for the beautiful spectacle is not definitively known, with theories ranging from a defence mechanism against predators to a way of attracting more birds to join their winter roost. Scroll down for video . Mystery: The reason for the starlings' beautiful displays is not known but some believe it could be a form of defence against predators . Gretna is one of the most famous locations for gatherings of starlings in the world - and this week Press Association photographer Owen Humphrey captured a stunning display involving up to 50,000 birds. A survey of the birds across the UK is currently taking place, with members of the public being encouraged to record any sightings they make. The poll, conducted by the University of Gloucestershire and the Society of Biology, is the first of its kind and has already received more than 600 reports from Cornwall to John O'Groats. Dr Anne Goodenough, reader in applied ecology at Gloucestershire University, said: 'One of the theories behind the murmurations is that it means they are safer from predators such as hawks and falcons. Vast numbers: Up to 50,000 starlings in formation were caught on camera above the town of Gretna, in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland . Wonder: The birds have been known to form a variety of recognisable shapes during their spectacular murmurations . 'Another theory could be they are signalling a large roost and could be a way of attracting other birds to that area to build up a big flock as it would be warmer. 'It's much warmer to roost as a big group rather than a smaller one and the murmurations can be as big as 100,000 birds. 'Why is it only European starlings that undertake massive aerial displays for sustained period before roosting? We don't really know. Annual phenomenon: Gretna Green is famous for these ‘murmurations’ - where starlings fly back en masse to their winter roost in the Scottish village after a day’s feeding . Theory: Ecologist Dr Anne Goodenough believes the murmurations make starlings safer from predators such as hawks and falcons . 'But that makes this topic a really fascinating one to study. If we can work out exactly why starlings murmurate, maybe it will be a good way in to working out why many other species do not.' The study is asking people who see murmurations to records things such as the location, the number of birds, the habitat and how long it lasts. Starling numbers in the UK are actually declining - falling by 66 per cent since the 1970s - and it is hoped the survey will provide important information about their habitat and behaviour. The survey can be found at www.societyofbiology.org/starlingsurvey. Alternative explanation: Another theory is that the starlings are signalling a large roost and trying to attract other birds to the area .

"An Iowa woman had an eye-opening experience last week when she went to the doctor for a stomach ache and gave birth to rare twins in the hospital hours later. Shelby Magnani and her fiancé James Croskey of Ankeny, Iowa had no idea Shelby was six-months-pregnant with one child - let alone two. Ava and Anna were born by C-section last Thursday weighing just four and three pounds each. Not only was Shelby pregnant with twins, but she was pregnant with a rare form called monoamniotic twins who only have a 50 per cent survival rate because they share the same placenta and sac which can lead to complications, reports Whotv. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Miracle twins: Ava and Anna were born by C-section on Thursday after their mother Shelby Magnani went to the doctor for a stomach-ache and later discovered she was six-months-pregnant with rare monoamniotic twins . All bundled up: The premature twins will have to spend a few weeks in medical care but will be home and healthy with mom and dad in a couple of weeks . Optimistic: The monoamniotic twins weigh just four and three pounds each and even though their type of twin has just a 50 per cent survival rate, they are doing great and are expected to go home soon . Happy parents: James Croskey and his fiance Shelby Magnani feel blessed to have given birth to such beautiful and healthy daughters despite not knowing Shelby was pregnant with twins . 'I had really sharp pain in my left side and went into the doctor, and they said we think you might be pregnant. They told me I was six months and told me to get down to the ER. They did an ultrasound and told me it was twins,' says Shelby Magnani of the whirlwind experience. 'It`s pretty nuts, still sinking in,' said her fiancé James Croskey who was both shocked and elated to hear the news. Dr. Jennifer Krupp with Perinatal Center of Iowa explained how when twins share both a placenta and a sac, as in the case of Ava and Anna, their cords can become entangled which can cause serious health problems and death. 'About one to two percent of all pregnancies are twins but even rarer than that is monoamniotic twins. They have one placenta and one amniotic sac and both of those twins share the placenta as well as the sac,' says Dr.  Krupp. Less than one per cent of all twins are monoamniotic, she added. 'The entanglement of the cords is what we worry about. We bring the patients into the hospital at 24 to 26 weeks, so we can monitor the babies several times a day, because we know the risk of one or both of those babies dying is fairly significant,' says Dr. Krupp. Celebrating: Shelby and James are overjoyed and celebrating the birth of their twin girls Ava and Ana . Lucky girls: The twins are being monitored but are doing well and should be going home with their happy mother and father in just a couple of weeks . Monoamniotic: Both Ava and Anna survived birth despite being monoamniotic twins meaning they shared both a sac and placenta when they were in their mother's womb . Delighted: Shelby Magnani is thrilled to be a mother even though the birth of her twins was truly unexpected . That's no tummy-ache: Shelby Magnani went to the doctor and soon enough will leave the hospital with her monoamniotic twin girls Ava and Anna . Proud parents: Shelby Magnani had never been so happy to have a stomach ache as she was on Thursday when she miraculously gave birth to rare twins without ever knowing she was pregnant . Magnani said that she realizes just how lucky she is that her children are alive and doing well. The twins will spend the next several weeks in the NICU at Mercy Hospital Medical Center in Des Moines but other than some monitoring are expected to be okay. 'I`m still trying to process. It`s crazy how high risk mono-mono twins can be, and how good they`re doing now, it`s really a blessing,' says Magnani. 'They`re both just little miracles, it could have been so many things that went wrong that didn’t,' she effused. Doctors expect that Ava and Anna will be able to go home with their doting parents in just a couple of weeks. Both Croskey and Magnani are still in school at DMACC for automotive technology, reports Fox. They told reporters that when they graduate they want to open their own business.

"Hurricane Gonzalo is barreling straight towards Bermuda, threatening to wreak havoc on the island with 130 mph winds. The National Hurricane Center places Bermuda directly in the path of the monster hurricane, which is the Atlantic's strongest in three years. Satellite images show the Category 4 storm is around 600 miles south of the island and Accuweather predicts it will make landfall late on Friday and into Saturday. Flights out of Bermuda are fully booked for the rest of the week and hardware stores were inundated with shoppers, the Royal Gazette reported. 'We sold out of generators [Tuesday], and items like batteries, tarp and ropes have been flying off the shelf,' Mark Stearns, a hardware store general manager, said. 'Everything that is on the hurricane list has been going fast and furious. People are definitely nervous about this storm.' After smashing into Bermuda, Hurricane Gonzalo is expected to head northeast and hit Newfoundland in far eastern Canada on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Danger: Hurricane Gonzalo is pictured in the Atlantic ocean in a NASA satellite image on Wednesday. The monster storm, which has winds of 130mph, has strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane and is expected to hit Bermuda late on Friday . Route: A National Hurricane Center map shows the predicted route of the storm. Its current location is marked by the orange dot . Devastating: Another graphic shows how the storm will weaken as it pushes northeast and brushes eastern Canada on Sunday . The storm has already battered islands across the West Indies, with images revealing destroyed boats, down trees and debris strewn across beaches in Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin on Tuesday. Authorities on some of the smaller islands buffeted by Gonzalo said at least one person was dead and two were missing. An unidentified elderly man was killed aboard a boat in St. Martin's Simpson Bay Lagoon, which looked like a ship graveyard on Tuesday with several masts protruding from the water. Dozens of boats were damaged and power was knocked out in the Dutch Caribbean territory, and Acting Coast Guard Director Wendell Thode said 22 of the 37 boats destroyed by the storm were in the Simpson Bay Lagoon. 'Most of the boats that are destroyed are completely under water,' he said. On Tuesday, when the storm hit the West Indies, it had top sustained winds of nearly 125 mph (205 kph) and was centered about 705 miles (1,135 kilometers). It is moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). Destruction: Destroyed buildings can be seen along the beach of Point a Pitre, Guadeloupe on Tuesday after Gonzalo swept through . Wreckage: The storm picked up even more strength as it left Guadeloupe (pictured) and is now a Category 4 storm . Shaken: A woman walks past damaged trees in Orient Bay on the French Caribbean island of Saint Martin on Tuesday. Three people are missing at sea after the hurricane Gonzalo swept through the French Caribbean islands of  Saint Barthelemy and Saint-Martin . On Wednesday, it was updated to a Category 4 storm - storms that have sustained winds of at least 130 mph (209 kph) with the potential to cause catastrophic damage. 'Folks in Bermuda are going to need to start paying attention to this thing,' Dennis Feltgen, a National Hurricane Center meteorologist, said by phone. Bermuda's government posted a hurricane watch for the British territory, urging islanders to keep an eye on the storm's progress. Authorities are still searching for a man last seen on a dinghy near the French Caribbean territory of St. Martin and another man last seen standing close to a harbor in St. Barts, said Matthieu Doligez, general secretary of the prefecture in St. Martin. Havoc: A picture shows damaged utility poles in the aftermath of the hurricane Gonzola on October 14, 204 on Saint Martin .

Aftermath: Residents survey the damage in Point a Pitre, Guadeloupe after the hurricane swept through on Tuesday . Amy Arrindell, vice president of the St. Maarten Zoological and Botanical Foundation, said the St. Maarten Zoo was heavily damaged but no animals escaped or died. She said trees were uprooted, the petting zoo was destroyed and the animals' enclosures were flooded. 'There is major damage to the structure,' she said. 'It is total devastation.' The last major hurricane to directly hit Bermuda was Fabian in 2003, National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen told USA Today. Gonzalo is the strongest storm in the area in three years; the last Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic Basin was Ophelia in 2011. Its highest winds were 140mph.","The storm was upgraded to a Category 4 storm on Wednesday morning .

"Jess Noy has been cooking squirrel for years thanks to a ready supply from her gamekeeper father . They're cute and fluffy, and can provide hours of entertainment in our gardens with their gravity-defying antics. But a new breed of chefs prefers grey squirrels chopped up, cooked with herbs and spices, and served with salad. Among them is Jess Noy, who enjoys turning Tufty into samosas, pasties, pies and burgers. The 26-year-old redhead has been cooking squirrel since her teens, along with rabbit, pheasant, partridge, pigeon, venison and duck, thanks to a ready supply from her father, a gamekeeper in East Anglia. Her catering business The Gamekeeper’s Daughter has caught the eye of Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry and The Mail on Sunday’s food critic Tom Parker Bowles. Jess said: ‘Squirrel is developing a following among foodies – it turns up on restaurant menus now and at food fairs. It’s a good, tasty meat because squirrels have a completely natural diet.’ Last month celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall was attacked by animal rights campaigners after he revealed he regularly cooks squirrels. Jess said: ‘Some people say it’s cruel but grey squirrels have to be culled and it would be shameful to waste good meat.’ Her first commercial squirrel dish was a nutty pasty she made for a farmers’ market in her native Suffolk three years ago. Since then she has displayed her skills on various TV cooking shows. For The Mail on Sunday, Jess prepared squirrel goujons with a salad of leaves, beetroot, pear and hazelnuts. The squirrel was jointed, dipped in breadcrumbs flavoured with smoked paprika, garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary and chilli, then fried. It was gamey, tasty and not dissimilar to rabbit – but under all that grey fluff there was only enough for one very small starter. The 26-year-old redhead enjoys turning Tufty into samosas, pasties, pies and burgers and says it would be a 'shame to waste good meat' as grey squirrels need to be culled.

"A young man bullied so badly at school he developed anorexia has overcome his eating disorder to become a bodybuilder. Perry Andrews, 24, from Cardiff, dropped out of school at age 16 as daily torments from bullies drove him to stop eating. By the age of 15 he was in the grip of anorexia and although he was 5'11"" tall, his weight had plummeted to a worrying seven stone. Perry Andrews, now 24, developed anorexia (left) after being bullied at school. But he managed to beat the disorder and became a bodybuilder (right) He decided to beat his anorexia after seeing a bodybuilder on the cover of a health and fitness magazine. Over eight years he worked hard to achieve his dream figure (pictured) Mr Andrews now weighs 12st 6lb after a gruelling fitness regime involving training five times a week . He lifts 100kg deadweights, 100kg on the bench press and wears a weighted vest when doing bodyweight exercises . Then one day a fit and healthy model on the cover of a fitness magazine inspired him to beat his problem and become fit and healthy. He joined a gym and started a training regime, eventually achieving a healthy weight he is happy with, of 12st 6lb. Over the next few years he built up his confidence as well as his muscles, asking a girl out for the first time in his life, and ending up in a happy relationship. This year, he hopes to compete in the Body Power Expo's 'Physique of the Week' competition, and says that 'anything is possible' with willpower and discipline. Mr Andrews, who works as a customer services employee at BHS, said the difficult times he has faced have shaped his character today. He told MailOnline: 'I feel amazing now. 'Life comes with bad days and good days and the bad days structure who you are. 'I'd say to my former self, never give up. Put your mind to it and do it. 'It's hard being in that position, but you will get over it. 'It's made me more understanding. I'd say to people in my previous position, it's sad, and it's not something to be ashamed of.' He said he felt different to other children from a young age, but when he moved up to secondary school at age 11, he soon became bullied on a daily basis. Breakfast: Two whole eggs, two egg whites, cooked in coconut oil with spinach . Porridge with chocolate protein shake from PhD Growth Factor Mass or PhD Synergy . Mid-morning: chicken, broccoli and sweet potato . 12 o’clock (while training): PhD Growth Factor Mass or PhD Synergy shake . Lunch: Steak, broccoli and sweet potato . Dinner: Cod or tuna with green vegetables and wholegrain rice . Dessert: Cottage cheese with chocolate protein shake mixed in. This is sometimes put in the freezer so its like ice cream. Exercise: He currently trains five days a week, with Sunday as a rest day. He said: 'When I was in primary school, I was a typical ""geek"" with glasses, and was the first person to put my hand up for a question, or stay late at the end of the lesson. 'I was a target for them. They noticed I was that type of person. 'Then I went up to higher school and it all fell apart there. 'I got bullied mentally and physically. They shouted things at me, flipped pen lids, threw paper, put things on my chair.' The bullying affected his social life and his grades at school. He said: 'It went on, I didn't tell anyone, I didn't know what to do, I was afraid. 'I missed out on everything. I didn't socialise as much. It became a huge part of my life. 'I had a few friends, but they were in the same position with the bullies. We had to learn to stand on our own two feet. 'My grades were affected.' Slowly, he began to deny himself food, and though at 15 he was a tall 5'11"", he eventually weighed just seven stone. He said: 'I was a healthy kid, quite chubby, but that all started to change over the years. 'I was not eating at all. When my mum wasn't looking I'd throw food in the bin. 'They did ask me if I was OK in school but I kept denying it.' This weight put his BMI at 13 - way below the healthy range of 18.5 to 25. At this level, doctors warn being so underweight can cause stunted growth, weakened muscles and lack of energy. Mr Andrews said he was tired all the time, had little motivation to do anything, and suffered terrible insomnia. 'It was overpowering, I was at my lowest point. I knew I had to change or face the consequences.' Feeling ashamed of being bullied, Mr Andrews hid both the bullying and his anorexia from his mother and brother . Mr Andrews now eats a diet of lean meats, green vegetables, sweet potatoes and PhD Nutrition protein shakes in order to maintain his muscular physique . As a teenager, Mr Andrews said the bullying meant he rarely socialised and never had a girlfriend during school . Mr Andrews stopped eating by the age of 15, throwing food in the bin when his mother wasn't looking. By the age of 17 (pictured), he had begun to put weight back on after reintroducing biscuits at first . After coping with the bullying and an eating disorder became too much, he dropped out of school midway through his A-levels and took a part time job. One day he went along to Warwickshire with his brother, who was doing work experience there, and picked up a health and fitness magazine. Seeing the cover star, with a fit and healthy body, he was inspired to get his life back on track. He said: 'I decided things were going to have to change. 'I looked in the mirror and thought ""that's how I wanted to be"". He started to introduce foods slowly, until he could eat whole meals again. He said: 'It started off with a rich tea biscuit and then I'd start eating more things like Twix bars; bit of sugar to keep my energy going. 'It went on from there.' His brother was a member of a local gym, so he joined and researched diet and nutrition plans on the internet. Having never had a girlfriend, last year he built up the confidence to ask a girl out for the first time . Within a year, he had put on two stone, achieving a much more healthy weight. In the years since, he has gone on to train five days a week and now eats a diet of lean meats, sweet potato, green vegetables and  protein shakes from the brand PhD nutrition. Bodybuilding gave him so much confidence he was also able to ask someone out for the first time in his life, having never had a girlfriend because being bullied had left him with low self-esteem. He said: 'To be honest I didn't have a girlfriend until a year and a half ago.' 'We met in work, we'd been working together for a while. 'We clicked on that level. I asked her out and she said yes. I couldn't believe it. 'She's behind me 100 per cent, she helps motivate me on a down day, reminding me where I've been and where I'm going to. 'Now I have more confidence in myself. I'm a happier, better soul.' A regime of lifting 180kg deadweights, 100kg on the bench press and wearing a weighted vest when doing bodyweight exercises has now put his weight at a muscly 12st 6. Proud of his hard work, he is determined to win the Body power Expo's 'Physique of the week' competition he has entered, which was the competition that inspired him to change his life. 'I'm in the mindset that I've already won' he said. 'When I think back to before, all those problems have disappeared. I feel amazing.'","Perry Andrews, 24, was bullied daily at school and developed anorexia .

"A four-year-old girl who was abducted by her mother from Texas 12 years ago has been rescued from Mexico in a secret mission. Sabrina Allen, who is now 17, and her mother, 44-year-old Dara Llorens, flew to Houston on Tuesday evening, an investigator told USA Today. It is unclear if Sabrina has been reunited with her father, Greg Allen, who revealed in a teary video on Wednesday that his daughter had been told he had committed suicide. Llorens is in police custody at the Travis County Jail, where she has been booked on aggravated kidnapping charges and is being held on $300,000 bond. She allegedly failed to return Sabrina to her father's custody following an unsupervised visit in 2002 and has since undergone plastic surgery to disguise herself, Greg Allen said in the video. Scroll down for video . Back home: Sabrina Allen, pictured left before she was kidnapped by her mother in 2002, has been rescued from Mexico and returned to the U.S. Right, an image of what she might look like now, aged 17 . Although Sabrina has apparently missed out on years of schooling, she was in good physical health when she was found and is now being evaluated by Medical Health experts in Texas. She and her mother were found using fake names in a small town in Mexico, her father said in the emotional video on his GoFundMe page. He explained that Sabrina was still dyeing her hair - as her mother had done when she was a child - when she was found. 'She was not in school and her education is reportedly several years behind,' he said. 'She was effectively a prisoner in a two-bedroom apartment.' He added that his ex-wife had told their daughter that he didn't want her and that he had committed suicide. The girl had also been told her paternal grandparents were dead, he said. Torn apart: Greg Allen, left, said he never stopped looking for his daughter after the girl's mother, Dara Llorens, right, took her in 2002 and dyed the girl's hair to elude police. Llorens is now in police custody . Emotional: In a video released on Wednesday, Sabrina's father Greg said that his daughter had been told that she didn't want him and that he had committed suicide. He thanked authorities for their help . 'She's in pretty bad shape,' he added. 'Sabrina has been under a pretty intense campaign to hate me for 10 years.' He added that Llorens has 'apparently had extensive plastic surgery to disguise her appearance.' Llorens, who was divorced from Allen in 2002, allegedly abducted the girl during an unsupervised visit at the end of a six-month period of court-supervised visitations. When a judge ordered her to turn over the girl to her father's custody by 6pm on April 21, 2002, Llorens fled to Mexico with her, changing her hair color to elude authorities. A Travis County warrant says that Allen never gave Llorens permission to take his child to Mexico. 'During April and Mary of 2002, Dara Llorens intentionally and knowingly abducted the child by restraining her so as to interfere substantially with her liberty, by moving her from one place to another,' the warrant noted. Changed: When the girl was spotted, left, in Mexico City 14 months later, her mother had apparently dyed her blonde locks, right, dark brown. When she was found, she was still dyeing her hair, her father said . Taken: Sabrina Allen, who is now 17, has returned to Texas and is being evaluated, her family said . Missed: Her father, Greg, was due to take custody of the girl when her mother snatched her in 2002 . The mother and her daughter were tracked down to Mexico City after 14 months but managed to get away from authorities. Pictures taken at the time showed the girl's blonde locks dyed brown. At the time, they were living under the assumed names Blanca Aurora Fabian Urieb and Adriana Fabian Uribe. They were last seen living there in June 2003. Sabrina was finally rescued during a secret rescue mission on Tuesday. One person was injured during the rescue mission - which was carried out by a child rescue team, the FBI, U.S. Marshal service and Mexican authorities - in a small town southeast of Mexico City. The official's injuries are not life threatening. In another statement on FindSabrina.org, Sabrina's father Greg said he is 'overjoyed' that she has been found alive and safe. Snatched: Llorens allegedly took her daughter into Mexico after she was supposed to hand the child over to the custody of her father. Greg Allen said his ex-wife has apparently had plastic surgery to appear different . 'Our entire family would like to thank the investigators that made this happen,' he said. 'Our prayers go out to the Mexican Federal Police Officer who was injured. 'We also would like to thank the Mexican Government for their cooperation in this case. 'Last, a heartfelt thank you to the USFBI, US Marshals, and all of the investigators that have worked this case for the last 12 years. They never gave up. We look forward to being reunited very soon.' The FBI and Austin police said they will provide more information at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. Grown up: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children previously shared this image of Sabrina, whose mother dyed her blonde hair so they would not be detected by authorities . The child has been listed as missing by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ever since. Last March, the girl's father, who has three other children, vowed never to give up looking for his daughter. 'I want to find her,' Allen told Fox7. 'I want to see her again. She needs to know she has a family that loves her. I can't just give up on her.'","Sabrina Allen was just four when her mother, Dara Llorens, took her during an unsupervised visit and fled to Mexico .

"A Halloween-loving New Jersey family has their Bellmawr neighborhood more creeped out than spooked with a front yard holiday display of bloody babies hanging from nooses. They also just happened to be named Krueger. But these festive pranksters aren't after your children's souls, they're just looking to spread the Halloween joy. Even the fact that the three young Krueger children spent hours on the unsettling creation isn't enough to convince some unimpressed  residents the display is all in good fun. Creepy: The Halloween loving Krueger family has their New Jersey neighborhood creeped out by this decoration featuring bloody babies dangling from nooses . 'I like to see witches, you know goblins and ghosts, not hanging babies,' creeped out neighbor Toni Flaherty told Fox 29 Philly. 'It's not scary, It's gross. It's disgusting. It's horrible.' The kids of the family couldn't disagree more. 'It's hilarious and funny and scary all in one,' Lily Krueger, 10. Her 8-year-old brother Greg agreed, as does their father, Chris Krueger. Kids these days: Lily and Greg Krueger (ages 10 and 8 respectively) spent hours on the bloody baby decor, only to have neighbors label it an eyesore . Hanging tough: The kids say they built the display all in good fun and can't understand what's so controversial about it . 'This is what scary is today. I don't think people realize that. This is what the kids are into,' sad Mr. Krueger, who appeared shocked that neighbors would be so concerned about the decorations. Their family, he said, has always loved the October holiday. They were the first on the block to put up decorations. But they don't intend to be the first to back down. Krueger says he has no plans to take down his kids' Halloween creation. The kids' dad Chris Krueger says the family has absolutely no plans to take down their doll gallows display .

"Eleven reputed members and associates of one of New York's legendary crime families have been arrested in a major blow weakening the family's grip' on New Jersey. The Genovese family and their associates allegedly used check cashing businesses and a Newark restaurant to run a racketeering enterprise that reaped millions of dollars through loansharking and money laundering, New Jersey officials said Tuesday as they announced charges against 11 people. One of those arrested was reputed Genovese family capo Charles Tuzzo of Bayside, New York, who was charged with racketeering, money laundering, conspiracy, loansharking and promoting gambling. One of those arrested was reputed Genovese family capo Charles Tuzzo (left) who was charged with racketeering, money laundering, conspiracy, loansharking and promoting gambling. Reputed Genovese soldier Vito Alberti, 55, (right)  was charged with the same crimes as Tuzzo as well as one tax-related count . N.J. acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman (pictured) announces the arrests of seven alleged members of the New York based Genovese organized crime family in Newark, N.J . Also arrested was reputed Genovese soldier Vito Alberti, 55, of New Providence, New Jersey, whom authorities charged with the same crimes as Tuzzo as well as one tax-related count. The 80-year-old Tuzzo, Alberti and five others were being held on $400,000 bail each and were scheduled for an initial court appearance later Tuesday in Morris County. Three people were charged by summonses and one, Vincent Coppola of Union, was being sought. It wasn't immediately clear whether any of the defendants had lawyers. Coppola is the son of jailed Genovese capo Michael Coppola, acting state Attorney General John Hoffman said Tuesday. Three people were charged by summonses and one, Vincent Coppola of Union, (far right) was being sought . The money laundering and loansharking ran through check cashing businesses owned by Domenick Pucillo of Florham Park, Hoffman said . Racketeering and money laundering carry prison sentences of 10 to 20 years, and sentences for first-degree money laundering - a charge faced by all 11 defendants - run consecutive to sentences for other charges, according to the attorney general's office . Michael Coppola was captured in 2007 after spending more than a decade on the run after being charged in the fatal shooting of a fellow mobster in a New Jersey motel parking lot in the late 1970s. The money laundering and loansharking ran through check cashing businesses owned by Domenick Pucillo of Florham Park, Hoffman said. Pucillo had about $3 million in illegal loans on the street over a two-year period, and he and others reaped about $1.3 million in interest by charging annual rates of up to 156 percent, Hoffman said. Hoffman and Michael Murphy, commissioner of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, estimated that $400 million in checks were illegally cashed through the Portucale Restaurant in Newark's Ironbound section over a four-year period in another operation they say was financed by Pucillo. They said patrons would cash checks for more than $10,000 at the restaurant for a fee of up to 3 percent to launder money or hide income. The owner of the restaurant, Abel Rodrigues, 52, of Bridgewater, was charged with racketeering, money laundering, conspiracy, operating an unlicensed check cashing facility and filing a bogus tax return.

In all, about $12 million in illegal profit was collected through the various enterprises, in addition to a sports gambling operation that used an offshore website in Costa Rica, Hoffman said. A percentage of the profit was kicked up to the Genovese family in New York, he said. 'They were up to a lot of the old Mafia tricks in New Jersey, including loansharking and illegal gambling, to the tune of millions of dollars,' Hoffman said. 'History teaches us that as long as demand exists for illicit loans, illicit gambling, drugs and other black-market goods and services, organized crime is going to turn a profit by preying on society.'","Family allegedly 'ran a racketeering enterprise that reaped millions of dollars through loansharking and money laundering'

"Call: Environment secretary Owen Paterson will today call for Britain to lead the way in adopting GM foods . Ministers want GM crops on supermarket shelves by the end of the decade after declaring they are ‘categorically’ safer than conventional food. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson yesterday made the extraordinary claim that millions of children in the developing world are 'dying or going blind' because the controversial technique has not been more widely adopted. He blamed European reluctance to grow 'Frankenfoods' for 'generating unwarranted resistance to the technology in the parts of the world' that need it most. ‘Over the last 15 years… every attempt to deploy Golden Rice [modified to boost Vitamin A] has been thwarted and in that time seven million children have gone blind or died,’ he said. ‘I think all those who have thwarted the attempts to bring this in, for free, should reflect those are real young people. ‘Young people will wake up this morning able to see and they will go to bed blind for life. Some of them will die today.’ But when asked if he would feed a genetically modified tomato to his children, he first hesitated before saying ‘yes’. His bold claims that GM crops are safer and would save lives were dismissed by critics as ‘hysterical’ and ‘emotional nonsense’, which deflects from more sustainable ways of improving food security. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson claims adoption of GM in the UK could be as significant as the agricultural revolution . Mr Paterson will argue that using GM crops to improve yields will require less space, freeing up more greenfield land . Earlier this year, the International . Rice Research Institute, which is working on the Golden Rice project, . denied reports that it was available for commercial planting, saying it . has yet to pass safety tests or prove it could reduce vitamin A . deficiency. Dr Helen Wallace, of GeneWatch, which . campaigns to ensure any use of GM is in the public interest, said: ‘Owen . Paterson has lost the plot when he starts claiming that GM food is . safer than the food we all eat every day. ‘Genetic engineering can introduce new . proteins into food or cause unexpected changes that are not fully . understood and it is important that people can avoid such foods if they . don’t want to eat them. ‘Claims that critics of GM are killing . babies elsewhere in the world is verging on hysteria. A decision on . whether to grow Golden Rice will be made in the Philippines, not Europe. It is in any case an unproven approach to tackling vitamin A deficiency . and better ways exist to stop children growing blind.’ Flashback: Campaigners dump four tonnes of GM soya outside Downing Street in 1999 at the height of the protests against genetically modified food . Peter Melchett, policy director at the . Soil Association, said: ‘Paterson is simply ignoring the science when . claiming GM crops are safe when there is no scientific evidence to . support that statement. ‘And his claims that millions of . people have died in developing countries because efforts to grow Golden . Rice have been thwarted is emotional nonsense. No one in Europe had any . control over GM Golden Rice and therefore, no way of stopping it.’ Due to public concern, there are only a handful of products containing GM-crops currently available on British high streets. In recent weeks the Prime Minister, . the Government’s chief  scientific adviser, Sir Mark Walport, and . Science Minister David Willetts have all voiced support for the . controversial technology. Many scientists have also voiced their support for the technique. Due to public concern, there are only a handful of products containing GM-crops currently available on British high streets . His bold claims that GM crops are safer and would save lives were dismissed by critics as 'hysterical' and 'emotional nonsense' But a British Science Association . study showed public support for ‘Frankenstein foods’ declining from 46 . per cent in 2002 to only 27 per cent now. Campaign groups have also raised . concerns over ministers’ secret meetings with GM lobby groups – details . of which emerged only following freedom of information requests. Currently, there are no commercial GM . crops in Britain, but livestock is commonly reared on imported GM feed. So far biotech firms have been deterred due to tough European . regulations. But Mr Paterson, a long-standing . advocate of GM technology, wants to see an easing of the restrictions. He said he wants to see the controversial produce on British supermarket . shelves before the end of the decade or ‘as soon as possible’. Speaking yesterday from Rothamsted . Research in Hertfordshire, where he toured the only active GM crop trial . in Britain, he insisted the technology was safer than conventional . farming methods. ‘It’s not probably safer,’ he said. ‘We have an absolute categoric statement from the chief scientific officer.’ Regardless of the view in Westminster, the administrations in Scotland and Wales remain firmly opposed to GM. Environment secretary Owen Paterson (left) and Plant Molecular Geneticist Huw Jones view a genetically modified crop trial . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson insists GM poses no threat to health or the environment and that it could feed a hungry world. Here SEAN POULTER examines his claims and identifies many disturbing questions:Public Health . CLAIM: GM food is ‘probably safer’ than the meals we eat today. ‘There is no substantiated case of any adverse impact on human health,’ said Mr Paterson.REALITY: In May 2011, independent doctors in Canada reported that toxins implanted into GM crops to kill pests were reaching the bloodstreams of women and unborn babies. Ninety-three per cent of blood samples taken from pregnant women and 80 per cent of umbilical cords showed traces of the chemicals, probably ingested by eating meat, milk and eggs from livestock fed GM corn.There is no conclusive evidence about the health effects, but these toxins could conceivably trigger changes in the body, including allergies, miscarriages, abnormalities and even cancer. Despite Paterson's claims to the contrary, evidence from UK trials and commercial cultivation in the US points to real damage to the ecosystem . Golden RiceCLAIM: This modified crop – which developing countries have been reluctant to accept because of fears over GM – contains high levels of vitamin A, which can protect eyesight. Mr Paterson’s emotive claim was that: ‘Over the last 15 years… every attempt to deploy Golden Rice has been thwarted and in that time seven million children have gone blind or died. Young people will wake up this morning able to see and they will go to bed blind for life. Some of them will die today.’REALITY: Children do not go blind overnight through a lack of Vitamin A in their diet. In any case, the same vitamin is available more cheaply through many other natural foods such as green vegetables. Doctors can also offer cheap supplement tablets where there is evidence of a problem. A protester carries an anti-GM banner . Environmental Effects . CLAIM: GM farming is good for the environment. ‘There is a very strong environmental case for GM,’ said Mr Paterson. ‘We can farm more efficiently, using new technology and using less land. It gives a wonderful opportunity to free up land for wilderness and forestry.’REALITY: Evidence from UK trials and commercial cultivation in the US points to real damage to the ecosystem. British farms were planted with crops of oilseed rape and beet that had been genetically modified to make them immune to heavy spraying with a powerful weedkiller. The results, published in 2003, revealed this spraying not only wiped out weeds, but also wild plants and insects. Butterfly numbers were down almost a quarter in some areas.One strain of GM corn – Mon 810 – has been created by US biotech firm Monsanto to include a toxin which kills pests. Poland banned the crop last year because its pollen was believed to be harming bees. It is also banned in Germany, France, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, and Luxembourg. PesticidesCLAIM: GM crops are better for the environment because farmers use fewer pesticides.REALITY: Evidence from the US suggests that initial reductions in the use of chemicals on GM crops are now being reversed.A study by Charles Benbrook, a research professor at Washington State University, found the weight of chemicals used on US farms has increased by 404million lb since GM was introduced in 1996. He warned: ‘Resistant weeds have become a major problem for many farmers reliant on GM crops, and are now driving up the volume of herbicide needed each year by about 25 per cent.’ Superweeds and SuperbugsCLAIM: ‘Thanks to biotechnology, farmers around the world have been able to protect yields, prevent damage from insects and pests and reduce farming’s impact on the environment,’ said Mr Paterson.REALITY: Weeds and insects sprayed with chemicals on GM farms in the US have evolved to become immune to them. As a result, superweeds are now so rampant in some areas that growers have resorted to machetes, flame throwers and defoliant chemicals used during the Vietnam war. The biggest threats are giant ragweed and pigweed, which grow at a rate of more than one inch a day and reach a height of 10ft. YieldsCLAIM: High-yield GM crops will save billions from starvation. ‘At this very moment there are one billion people on this planet who are chronically hungry,’ said Mr Paterson. ‘Are we really going to look them in the eye and say we have the proven technology to help, but the issue’s just too difficult to deal with, it’s just too controversial’?’REALITY: Research published this week shows that increases in crop yields have been much greater in countries which have not adopted GM.Yields of maize or corn in Europe, where farmers have rejected GM, have risen more quickly over the past 30 years than those in the US. Yields of oilseed rape have always been higher in Western Europe than Canada. This gap has grown since Canada started cultivating GM varieties.The research was carried out by a team based at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and published in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability. Indian cotton farmersCLAIM: Growing GM cotton has been of huge economic benefit to poor communities in India. ‘It has been a massive boon to some of the least advantaged people in the world,’ said Mr Paterson.REALITY: Prince Charles has pointed out the high rate of suicide in India among farmers growing GM cotton.Speaking in 2008, he highlighted the ‘truly appalling and tragic rate of small farmer suicides in India, stemming in part from the failure of many GM crop varieties’. He has been accused by the GM lobby of being ‘Luddite’ and ‘ignoring’ the potential benefits of GM crops to feed the Third World.","Owen Paterson said children are dying because GM food isn't being adopted .

"Call: Environment secretary Owen Paterson will today call for Britain to lead the way in adopting GM foods . Children will go blind or die if the world does not embrace genetically modified crops Owen Paterson claimed today. The Environment Secretary issued the controversial ultimatum as he claimed Britain could lead the way in producing GM food. He claims it would lower prices and free up the countryside. The Environment Secretary, a longstanding advocate of GM technology, claims its adoption in the UK could be as significant as the agricultural revolution. But ahead of a major speech he claimed the decision to back the controversial technology is a matter of life and death. He said 'golden rice' which could be grown in the world's poorest countries was first created in 1999 but had not been used to help solve global hunger. 'Now the World Health organisation estimates that up to 500,000 children go irreversibly blind a year, and 250,000 of those actually die. 'Now the problem is mainly in South-East Asia, but over the last 15 years, despite offering the seeds for free to those who would need them, every attempt to deploy this golden rice has been thwarted. And in that time, seven million children have gone blind or died. I think all those who have thwarted the attempts to bring in this – for free, don’t forget – should really reflect. 'Those are real young people, and today, young people will wake up this morning able to see, and they’ll go to bed blind for life. Some of them will die today.' In his speech Mr Paterson pointed out that since 1996 there has been a hundred-fold increase in the use of GM crops around the world, with 17million farmers in 28 countries now growing what critics have branded Frankenstein foods. Less than 0.1 per cent of this takes place in the EU. 'Farmers wouldn't grow these crops if . they didn't benefit from doing so,' he argued. 'Governments . wouldn't license these technologies if they didn't recognise the . economic, environmental and public benefits. 'Consumers . wouldn't buy these products if they didn't think they were safe and . cost-effective. While the rest of the world is ploughing ahead and . reaping the benefits of new technologies, Europe risks being left . behind. We cannot afford to let that happen. 'The . use of GM [technology] could be as transformative as the original . agricultural revolution was. The UK should be at the forefront now, as . it was then.' Mr . Paterson – who comes from a long line of farmers and tanners and keeps . sheep, hens and horses at his country home in North Shropshire –  claims that GM farming can help feed people in poorer countries and . inject missing vitamins into the diets of children in the UK. In . a speech designed to appeal to traditionalists, he also argued that . using GM crops to improve yields will require less space, freeing up . more greenfield land. 'If we use cultivated land more efficiently, we could free up space for biodiversity, nature and wilderness,' he said. He also argued that GM crops can help combat the effects of Britain's increasingly erratic climate. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson claims adoption of GM in the UK could be as significant as the agricultural revolution . Mr Paterson will argue that using GM crops to improve yields will require less space, freeing up more greenfield land . In recent weeks the Prime Minister, the Government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Mark Walport, and the Science Minister, David Willetts, have all voiced support for GM crops. Mr Paterson intends to lead a campaign among European ministers to make Brussels lift many of its restrictions on the use of GM technology. He said: 'I am conscious of those who have concerns and who need reassurance on this matter. I recognise that we – government, industry, the scientific community and others – owe a duty to the British public to reassure them that GM is a safe, proven and beneficial innovation.' Due to the speech's controversial content, the location where it was to be delivered was kept wraps last night to avoid it being hijacked by protesters. Flashback: Campaigners dump four tonnes of GM soya outside Downing Street in 1999 at the height of the protests against genetically modified food . Outlining what he will say, Mr . Paterson told BBC Radio 4's Today show this morning that there was no . evidence GM foods are harmful. 'The . facts show that in other parts of the world GM is being adopted as . normal practice. In 2012 there were 17 million farmers in 28 countries . growing GM crops on 170 million hectares, that's 12 epr cent of the . world's arable land or, very roughly, seven times the surface area of . the whole of the UK. 'These . crops are now established, they are part of normal life, they are part . of normal agricultural production, they are part of people's everyday . diets.' He questioned the reason behind the highly charged debate about the use of GMOs. 'Is . it emotion or is it evidence? There have been a whole raft of studies . across the EU, there have been about 50 projects over the last 25 years . on GM, 400 independent research groups.' Peter Melchett of the Soil Association warned: 'We need . farming that helps poorer African and Asian farmers produce food – not . farming that helps [GM producers] Bayer, Syngenta and Monsanto produce . profits.'","Owen Paterson said children are dying because GM food isn't being adopted .

"Viola Davis told a crowd of Hollywood luminaries that she grew up in abject poverty, stealing and crawling through maggot-filled garbage bins to get food. The 49-year-old Oscar-nominated actress is currently starring in ABC's flagship show How To Get Away With Murder. But tonight she revealed it has taken her years to come to terms with the 'immense shame' she felt about her childhood in Central Falls, Rhode Island. 'I sacrificed a childhood for food,' she said, 'and grew up in immense shame.' Scroll down for video . Opening up: Viola Davis told a crowd of Hollywood luminaries that her drive to end childhood hunger is fueled by memories of growing up in 'abject poverty,' stealing and crawling through maggot-filled garbage bins for food . Davis shared the personal story as she was made a Variety Power Of Women honoree for her work with the charity Hunger Is. She told the audience: 'Although my childhood was filled with many happy memories, it was also spent in abject poverty. 'I was one of the 17 million kids in this country who didn't know where the next meal was coming from. 'And i did everything to get food. 'I've stolen for food, I've jumped in huge garbage bins with maggots for food, I have befriended people in the neighborhood who I knew had mothers who cooked three meals a day for food. 'And I sacrificed a childhood for food... and grew up in immense shame.' Davis, the second youngest of six children, was born on her grandmother's farm in South Carolina before moving to Rhode Island months later. Daughter of a horse trainer and a maid, she attended Central Falls High School, where she said many children struggle to 'navigate their way through the darkness' of poverty and few prospects. Thanks to being a 'geek', she says, she secured a place at Rhode Island College, majoring in drama. She has since won two Tony Awards, been nominated for two Oscars, and donated $30,000 to her old high school. 'Immense shame': Davis, pictured as a child, said she did not know where the next meal was coming from . Revealed: She said she befriended kids in the neighborhood whose mothers cooked three meals a day . Fear: At the age of 49 she is only just beginning to come to terms with her childhood poverty, she said . 'Everyone should grow up and have a chance at the American dream,' she said tonight. 'The stain in this country is that one out of every five children in this country are living in households that are food-poor. 'And of all the elementary school teachers out there they say three out of every five kids in their class come to school hungry. In the richest country in the world.' Finally, she thanked her colleagues and supporters for the chance to 'stand up in front of so many people, at the age of 49, and share my testimony and begin the process of healing,' and urged people to join give either money or expertise to Hunger Is. Hunger Is vows to tackle America's food poverty epidemic through education. It was one of a number of charities recognized at the annual awards ceremony on Friday. Other accolades at the Variety Power of Women luncheon went to Jane Fonda, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Lopez  for their humanitarian efforts. Witherspoon was recognized for her involvement with the Malala Fund, the educational advocacy organization established by Malala Yousafzai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. Witherspoon said she was inspired by her daughter, Ava, to explore the state of girls' education around the world and learn about Malala's efforts. Not holding back: The star revealed 'I sacrificed a childhood for food and grew up in immense shame' Touched: Maria Bello gave her a tender embrace . Sisters in power: Viola posed with Reese Witherspoon . Lopez said her namesake foundation was also inspired by her children. Lopez said she and her sister, Lynda, started the Lopez Family Foundation when they were pregnant together in hopes of helping needy families receive high-quality health care. Fonda is involved with various philanthropic programs, but she was honored Friday for creating the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential, which works to prevent teen pregnancy and inspire healthy lifestyles in that state. Doing her part: Reese was recognized for her involvement with the Malala Fund, the educational advocacy organization established by Malala Yousafzai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday . 'I grew up believing that service is the rent you pay for life,' Fonda said. Other honorees included Universal Pictures chair Donna Langley, who works with Vital Voices, an international campaign that supports female community leaders; and Jessica Matthews, creator of the Soccket, a soccer ball that harnesses energy with play and becomes an off-grid power source. Guests at the Lifetime-sponsored luncheon at the Beverly Hilton Hotel included Ryan Seacrest, Maria Bello, Allison Janney and Wild author Cheryl Strayed.

"It really does pay to go to church. After a Chicago parish was bought out of a multi-income residential development it helped fund in the 1970s, it came into some money - to the tune of $1.6 million. And in deciding what to do with the unexpected fortune, pastor Laura Truax, of LaSalle Street Church in Gold Coast, decided to donate 10 percent of it to her own congregants. All 300 of them. Overjoyed: Pastor Laura Truax of Chicago's LaSelle Street Church decided to divide up $160,000 her church received in a real estate among her 300 congregants . Donations: The church thus wrote out 300 personal checks for $500 each and gave them out at a service of September 7 . Generous: In the 1970s, LaSelle Street Church (pictured) helped fund a multi-income housing development, which was sold in June for $50 million. The church received a stake of $1.6 million . In dividing up the $160,000 evenly, Truax worked out it was easiest to give each of her loyal regulars $500, and set about writing personal checks. 'In that moment, I was worried this is stupid, this is silly,' Truax told WGNTV. 'People will think I'm squandering $160,000. 'And I didn't want to be known as the person who squandered $160,000 and so I was nervous about that. 'But I felt like this was the place of faith.' 'It felt right.' So on September Pastor Laura, as she is known, announced to the church that it was actually them who would receive a donation. 'Some started to cry,' she said. 'Their mouths started to drop. I started to sweat because it sounded so crazy.' Pastor Laura told her congregants to do whatever they believed was right in the money, be that investment, helping others or helping themselves. Members started a board at the non-denomination church where they could right down some ideas on how best to use the $500. In shock: Members of the church could not believe it when they were told they would be receiving the money . Ideas: A message board has been set up at the church where members can write days way in which they can use the money to help people . There is still $1.4 million that the church itself will donate or invest. However pastor Laura said she really hopes her decision will inspire other churches. 'My real hope is that other churches will hear about this and they're going will swallow and they're going to jump. 'Find some way in them that we found and that they're going to jump with their people.' LaSalle Street Church owned a 15 percent stake in Atrium Village, a 309-unit residential development in nearby Near North Side. According to DNA Info, British Columbia-based company Omni Group acquired the site in June as part of a $50 million buyout. The church came out with $1.6 million.","LaSelle Street Church in Gold Coast bought out of residential development it helped fund in the 1970s .

"The Washington Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Tuesday in a case filed by three sex trafficking victims who say the website Backpage.com helps promote the exploitation of children. The suit is one of two taking on the classified ad website. A federal case was filed in Boston last week. KIRO-TV reported that court documents allege that the ages of the women, who were then teenagers, were not checked by Backpage.com. Harmful? A lawsuit filed by three sex trafficking victims say  Backpage.com helps promote the exploitation of children . The teenagers were allegedly digitally pimped, the affiliate station reported. The two plaintiffs in the Boston case alleged in the suit they 'were sold for sex in Massachusetts and Rhode Island more than 1,900 times combined when they were from 15 to 17 years of age,' The Boston Globe reported. Backpage attorney Elizabeth McDougall told the newspaper 'We work extremely closely with law enforcement to find and to help rescue victims and to collaborate in facilitating arrests and prosecutions of perpetrators.' Backpage.com argues that the lawsuits are an attempt at censorship. It says the Communications Decency Act gives it immunity from the activities of its members or users. Lawyers for the three girls say they were sold as prostitutes in advertisements on Backpage.com. They say it and other sites offering 'adult services' are not protected by the communications act because they are responsible for some of the information on the website. Backpage.com asked a Supreme Court judge to dismiss the case. The judge declined, so Backpage.com appealed. The lawsuit comes after Washington lawmakers passed a bill in 2012 that imposed a $10,000 fine and up to a year in prison if a website failed to make reasonable attempts to ascertain the age of someone placing an ad for commercial sex. The day it was to take effect, a federal judge issued a restraining order. The law was struck down in December 2012.

"Nearly ten years ago, Prince William, pictured in 2004, spent a fortnight working in Chatsworth House . Prince William spent a fortnight living and working incognito in one of Britain's most splendid stately homes, a new memoir has revealed. Nearly a decade after his Downton Abbey-style exploits, the Prince's days dressed in overalls and eating fish and chips with fellow housemen and joiners at Chatsworth House, in Derbyshire, have been revealed. In Chatsworth: The Housekeeper's Tale, Christine Robinson revealed stories from her 40 years working at the country estate. She describes meetings with everyone from the Queen and top politicians to Sir Anthony Hopkins. But one of her favourite anecdotes recalls the days when Prince William was living and working at the mansion in October 2005. 'He spent a week working around the estate and made sausage rolls and mince pies,' she told the Sunday Express. 'The look on visitors' faces was priceless, most obviously thought to themselves, 'that joiner is the double of Prince William.' 'When two old ladies came straight out and asked him, he admitted he really was the heir to the throne.' Christine, 59, started with a holiday job at Chatsworth alongside the housekeeping team in 1974. She cleaned, sold ice-cream and worked in the Orangery shop every summer until 1977. After graduating with a history degree from Newcastle University, she joined the housekeeping team, and went on to become head housekeeper eight years ago. Chatsworth House, om Derbyshire, is one of Britain's finest country estates and a popular filming location . Chatsworth House's head housekeeper Christine Robinson has written a memoir about her time there . She said: 'Only a handful of staff still working in the House can remember Chatsworth in its heyday at the time of the 11th Duke and Duchess, and I feel fortunate to be amongst their number. 'I give many talks to outside groups about the House and how we care for it, and one question always asked at the end of the talk is, “Why don’t you write all this down?” With that in mind, I began to gather my thoughts together about ten years ago, and the idea has finally come to fruition. 'I have met and worked with many Chatsworth characters over the years, and they too are brought to life, I hope, through the anecdotes I relate along the way.' In her book, she describes the history of the house from the early 1900s when her grandmother and great-grandmother worked in the kitchens. Christine worked closely with the late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, the youngest of the famous Mitford sisters whose aristocratic lives mesmerised the public, until she died in September at 94. Hard worker: Prince William, pictured in May 2004, inspects a lamb's hooves on a farm, left, and right, takes a walk on the Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire . Chatsworth House, in Derbyshire, is the seat of the Duke of Devonshire and has been in the Cavendish family since 1549. The history of Chatsworth begins with Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury, who was better known as Bess of Hardwick. Bess married four times, and it was with her second husband, Sir William Cavendish, who bought the estate in 1549 for £600 in 1549. In 1552, they began to build the first house on the site. The Hunting Tower, built in the 1580s, still stands on the hill above Chatsworth. By 1694, Chatsworth had fallen into a poor state of repair. The 4th Earl and 1st Duke of Devonshire began some much-needed work on the old house. The 2nd Duke made no changes to the house and garden, but he was a connoisseur of the arts, and responsible for an outstanding collection, which included paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman gems. The 5th Duke of Devonshire's principal residence was in London, but when they did come to Chatsworth, it was filled it with friends and relations. The house was open to the public, and on one day a month dinner was provided for whoever came to visit. The 6th Duke of Devonshire is remembered today as the 'Bachelor' Duke as he never married. He loved entertaining his friends and spent 47 years improving his many houses. He asked architect Sir Jeffry Wyatville to build the long North Wing at Chatsworth. The Duke formed a particularly important collection of sculpture which was housed in the purpose-built Sculpture Gallery in the new North Wing. When Edward Cavendish succeeded his father as 10th Duke of Devonshire in 1938, he and his wife planned many improvements at Chatsworth. But then the Second World War broke out and Chatsworth was occupied by Penrhos College, a girls' boarding school in Colwyn Bay. In 1949 the house was re-opened to visitors and 105,000 people visited within a year. In 1981 the running of Chatsworth was taken over by the Chatsworth House Trust, a charitable foundation established by the 11th Duke to help ensure the preservation of the house, its essential contents, the garden and the park for the benefit of the general public. The 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke - Peregrine Cavendish. The 11th Duke's widow, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, who was very active in promoting the estate and attracting visitors. She died in September this year. She was also responsible for many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. The house is a popular filming location and was used to film Pride and Prejudice, starring Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, in 2005 and more recently BBC series Peaky Blinders.

"A woman has made it her mission in life to find out why her beloved dad died of a heart attack when he was just 30 years old after a routine operation. Jenny Lloyd, 38, a nurse who grew up in Melbourne, has spent her life investigating the case of her dad David Lloyd's death at Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1978. Channel 7's Sunday Night carried an exclusive report on Ms Lloyd's journey to have her questions answered- she believes her dad died after being given Trasylol or clinical name aprotinin to stop bleeding after he was in a car accident. Scroll down for video . Jenny Lloyd has made it her mission in life to find out why her father David Lloyd died when she was two . David Lloyd, was a father of five, when he passed away in 1978 after being involved in a car accident . Trasylol was taken off the market in 2007 and the drug was used to stop excessive bleeding during surgery. Mr Lloyd was in the front seat of his friend's car when it hit another car, he hit his head on the dashboard but doctors initially missed a tear in his bowel and he had lost a lot of blood. During the operation the father-of-five was given Trasylol, despite the operation being apparently a success he died the next morning from a heart attack. Mr Lloyd's widow Jeanette told Sunday Night she always wondered why her 30-year-old husband died from the operation. Ms Lloyd said: 'Mum says he was the best man in the world and she has never met anyone in the world like him. 'He was a skinny little Pommy man, lots of nice little curls, he was a hard worker and he loved all of us kids.' David married Jeanette and the happy couple settled in Melbourne and planned for a large family . Jeanette Lloyd 28 and pregnant with her fifth child when her husband died . Mrs Lloyd describes her husband as a 'rascal' adding 'he was a wonderful dad, the children worshipped him and found every excuse to be out there in his company'. It wasn't until Ms Lloyd obtained her father's medical records when she was 17 by Freedom of Information did she start to try and uncover why he died. In 2011 surgeon Paul Flanagan, who works for the same hospital as Ms Lloyd, looked over Mr Lloyd's notes and saw that he had been given Trasylol. He says he believes the drug caused a clot that caused the heart attack. On January 26 2006 a report into Trasylol by The New England Journal of Medicine was published and it suggested the drug may increase the risk of serious side effects among patients. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) describes patients suffering from kidney damage, heart attack and stroke patients. The FDA said the 'major strength' of the study was the amount of people tested in the trial but there were negative factors because 'patients were not randomly assigned to any of the treatments for preventing bleeding'. Ms Lloyd believes her dad died because he was given Trasylol during a bowel operation after a car accident . Trasylol was owned by Bayer and it is now under the control of Nordic Pharma . It said: 'The study outcomes may not truly indicate Trasylol side effects.' Two observational studies suggested that Trasylol use may increase the risk for kidney damage compared to other drugs. In September 2006 the FDA then held another Advisory Committee which focused on kidney damage as well as patients with serious allergic reactions to Trasylol. The FDA then said Trasylol's recommendation should be changed to say it should only be used in patients at high risk of bleeding from cardiac arrest and that the labels should be changed to include warnings of hypersensitivity and kidney damage. In September 2006 it emerged Bayer had commissioned its own trial and its preliminary data suggested Trasylol increased the risk for in-hospital death in cardiac surgery patients’ which was discussed at a FDA press conference in 2007. In September 2007 the FDA Advisory Committee carried out another trial into mortality risks the past two studies had suggested. Ms Lloyd, 38, has dedicated her life to investigating what happened to her dad and why he died aged 30 . Ms Lloyd says the lives of her brothers and sisters were shattered when their father died . The FDA said: 'The Committee didn't find the results compelling enough to warrant a withdrawal so the Committee recommended more study.' A randomized control clinical trial in Canada then commenced but it was halted because Trasylol appeared to increase the risk for death compared with two other drugs. Following those results the FDA requested that Bayer suspend distribution of Trasylol, which it did. Ms Lloyd travelled to Cologne in Germany to face up to the Bayer shareholder's board and after giving her points she was met with no comment from the chairman. She then said: 'How come you can't talk about an intravenous drug that killed my dad and I will keep on talking over you so just stop.' She was applauded by the audience before being escorted off the premise by security guards. Ms Lloyd believes her dad died because he was given Trasylol by doctors . Ms Lloyd travelled to Germany to confront drug company Bayer and ask them her questions . Trasylol is now owned by Nordic Pharma in Paris and they said discussions are taking place to reintroduce Trasylol to Australia. A Nordic Pharma told Sunday Night: 'The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has undertaken an extensive assessment of all available clinical data on aprotinin...this included clinical studies, published literature, spontaneous reports of side effects and data from manufactures. uspend distribution of Trasylol . Bayer suspended the distribution of Trasylol in 2007 but the new owners Nordic Pharma are in talks to see the drug reintroduced . Ms Lloyd got her voice heard at the Bayer AGM and still grieves for the father she never knew . 'The CHMP concluded that the benefits of aprotinin outweigh its risk in appropriately managed patients undergoing isolated heart bypass surgery (not combined with other heart surgery), and recommended that the suspension of aprotinin medicines in the European Union be lifted for this revised indication.' The Royal Melbourne Hospital told Sunday Night: 'The staff at the Royal Melbourne Hospital provided Mr Lloyd with the best medical care available following his accident in 1978. 'The medical care given to any patient is guided by the best clinical evidence available at the time. Through research and clinical trials, new medical care and treatments are development, as was the case with the Trasylol in the 1970s for the treatment of trauma.'","Jenny Lloyd believes her dad David died of a heart attack at age 30 because he was given Trasylol .
One expert says Mr Lloyd died because the drug caused clotting in his blood which led to the heart attack, it was supposed to stop bleeding .
The 38-year-old became a nurse and obtained her dad's medical records when she was 17 to try and find out why he died .
Sunday Night's investigation sees Ms Lloyd go to AGM of pharmaceutical giant Bayer who manufactured the drug and come face to face with the shareholders .

"Dressed in his finest tuxedo and flanked by 200 of the world's sharpest businesswomen, it looked like Prince Harry's lucky night at a west London charity gala this evening. But despite his best efforts, the 30-year-old prince drew the short straw at the fundraising event, after being seated between two of the only other men in attendance. Never the martyr, the Royal poked fun at his luck during a speech to thank 100 Women in Hedge Funds, the organisation which hosted the gala dinner to raise money for WellChild, the national sick children's charity at Royal Hospital Chelsea.

Harry, who is a patron of WellChild - the national charity for seriously ill children and their families - then remarked on the 'Harry Potter-esque' dinner location. 'It is great to see you in this rather wonderful Harry Potter-esque setting. There will be no Quidditch. 'This hospital represents the importance which society places on the care of those less fortunate than ourselves.

"A murder trial had to be suspended because a member of the jury 'became ill' when gory images of the victim were shown as evidence. Roxanne Buck, 45, has been charged with the murder of her housemate, Michelle Johnson, 21, and tampering with evidence. The Burger King worker is accused of repeatedly stabbing and cutting Miss Johnson, 21, in her basement room, and then trying to clear away evidence. Roxanne Buck (pictured), has been charged with the murder of her housemate and tampering with evidence . The body of Michelle Johnson, (pictured), was found on March 15, an autopsy showed she died from sharp-force neck trauma . Miss Johnson's body was found on March 15, a few days after her mother, Dianna, who lived in the upstairs part of the Stow home, Ohio, with her, had last heard from her. On the opening day of testimony on Tuesday, police officer Jason Bailey said he found blood spatter in the basement of the defendant, near the foot of her bed. Outside, through a short pathway from an attached garage, the police officer said he found Miss Johnson partly covered by an old tire and blankets in an open storage shed behind the duplex. At the trial yesterday, Summit County Medical Examiner Lisa Kohler said Miss Johnson died from gaping wounds to the neck caused by a sharp instrument. Minutes into her testimony, a juror in the front row became ill as a series of gory autopsy photos were being shown and asked to be excused. Common Pleas Judge Mary Margaret Rowlands allowed the juror to leave the courtroom. After a half-hour recess, the woman returned and the trial resumed. Roxanne Buck, 45, a Burger King worker, is accused of repeatedly stabbing and cutting Miss Johnson, 21, in her basement room, and then trying to clear away evidence . Diane Johnson told the jury she had her last contact with her daughter a day earlier — through a Facebook posting about a hearty breakfast she had made. 'She was my best friend. She was my baby,' she said. Miss Johnson also testified that Buck was behind on their 50-50 rent agreement. Then, she said, she found out Buck twice used drugs at the duplex. 'I told her that if I ever caught her doing it again, I'd have to kick her out, because Michelle and I didn't tolerate drugs,' she told the jury. Defence attorney Scott Rilley said later that he asked for a mistrial in the judge's chambers, arguing that the autopsy photos had unduly prejudiced the jury. His motion was denied. In his opening statement, Rilley said police had 'no direct evidence' that Buck committed murder. 'Did she do morally questionable things? Yes,' Rilley said, referring to the charge that Buck in some way altered the crime scene. 'But did she kill Michelle Johnson? She did not.' Defence attorney Scott Rilley (pictured) said police had 'no direct evidence' that Buck had committed murder . Rilley said that Stow police conducted a 'minimal investigation' and quickly focused on Buck as the chief suspect. He told the jury, however, that a Stow police officer was involved in a relationship with Michelle Johnson at the time of her death and had parked his cruiser outside the duplex for two hours on the morning of March 13, some 26 to 28 hours before Johnson disappeared. Rilley said the department's Internal Affairs division interviewed the officer twice about the relationship. Soon after he was set to be questioned a third time — about a timeline for his actions — he resigned from the department, on April 8. Buck's trial is expected to last into next week.

After a huge band of rain sweeps across the country today, intense showers and storms will move in tomorrow followed by heavy downpours over the weekend. The wet - but unseasonably warm - weather is being caused by a massive low pressure which is sitting to the west of Britain, causing hurricanes in the US and unsettled conditions in the UK. Scroll down for video . A huge weather system covering the entire width of the Atlantic is set to hit Britain with repeated bands of rain over the next five days .

After heavy rain across the whole country today,  showers will hit the South West and Wales tomorrow, with thunder storms predicted in some areas. Met Office forecast maps predict showers will dump up to 16mm of rain an hour on parts of the South West late this evening, before another band of downpours of similar intensity moves into Wales and along the south coast tomorrow. There will then be a brief let-up on Friday morning, before more rain sweeps in from the West overnight and into Saturday morning. Around 65mm of rain is expected to fall on parts of Cornwall over the next five days - with more than 60mm predicted in Cumbria and South Wales.

'The showers are expected to be heaviest and most frequent in south Wales and south-west England during the afternoon when they may turn thundery. 'On Friday, many areas will be dry and fairly warm with some sunshine, although a few showers are possible in the west. Turning increasingly wet and windy in the west during the evening. On Saturday, rain will give way to sunshine and heavy showers. Remaining very mild for mid-October.' Met Office maps show the swirl of weather fronts caused by the very low pressure system currently sitting in the Atlantic Ocean . Images from NOAA show the storm moving across the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday (left) into Monday (right) earlier this week . Satellite images show the storm stretching from the east coast of the US right the way across the Atlantic as it swirls towards the UK . Leon Brown, a forecaster from the Weather Channel, says the conditions in the Atlantic make it difficult to know how long the wet weather will last. He said: 'A change in the weather pattern from today to a more 'westerly' flow from the Atlantic and a strong jet stream. This will bring more wet weather, but also some very mild temperatures for a time as southerly winds strengthen and draw warmth northwards from Iberia to western Europe, and the S.UK. 'The detail remains difficult for this weekend with a cold front meandering and waving about over the UK. 'The uncertainty for next week is the time and track of the remains of Hurricane Gonzalo, which is a risk for Bermuda as it speeds north on Friday. The extra tropical remnants will be caught in the jet stream on Monday and move rapidly eastwards towards NW Europe next Tuesday. 'At the moment it could bring a wet and windy spell to the UK next Tuesday or dissipate and track further south.' Commenting on the huge storm, he added: 'The large depression to the west of the UK is beginning to pump up warmth, but also moisture towards the UK. So, we can turn off the heating, but not quite T-shirt weather so keep the brollies and waterproof coats to handy too.' The huge storm is just one of three huge depressions filing the Atlantic Ocean at the moment, with Hurricane Fay and Hurricane Gonzalo currently barrelling towards Bermuda. The first bands of rain caused by the huge storm have already led to flooding in some parts, including this in Perry Barr, West Midlands . Flooded roads caused misery for many people driving to work, with huge tailbacks on the A34 as traffic was diverted . Warnings of further rain follow flooding in the village of Alconbury, Cambridgeshire yesterday after downpours earlier this week . Gale force winds and high tides coincided yesterday to create huge waves, which battered Seaham Harbour  in County Durham . A photo of the sunrise over the North Sea shows the calm this morning before heavy rain is set to roll across the UK later this week . The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the system's 'central pressure dropped 46 mb in 24 hours (from 1002 mb to 956 mb) – a textbook meteorological bomb'. The newspaper reported that the conditions are 'likely to bring stormy conditions to the northern British Isles Friday into the weekend'. The massive storm is just the latest weather system to move in from the US and play havoc with Britain's climate. In August this year, five flood warnings and 33 flood alerts were brought in when the remnants of Hurricane Bertha moved up from the Caribbean and swept across Britain. That hurricane formed in the warm waters of the Caribbean first lashed the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands with winds of up to 90mph. Bertha then travelled north, veering away from the US and Canadian coast before heading across the Atlantic and being downgraded to an 'Atlantic storm', which dropped 20mm of rain an hour on some parts of the UK. But hurricanes emanating from the region are not always bad news for Britain. Hurricane Cristobal, which ravaged parts of the Caribbean, brought warm weather to the UK later in August this year by dragging an area of high pressure up from Europe. Despite the wet weather on the way, parts of Britain enjoyed a beautiful sunrise this morning, as this picture of mist over a lake in Astwell Spinney, Northamptonshire, show . Sheep emerge from the mist this morning near Brackley, Northampton. The changeable weather is set to continue into next week .

"A drought-stricken lake in California has turned up a surprising discovery - the gun and badge of a federal agent which was accidentally dropped overboard more than two decades ago. The backpack was spotted by a fisherman at Castaic Lake in north Los Angeles County, California on Thursday. The water level has dropped almost 50 per cent to 151 feet, leading the gun and badge to be easily retrieved from once deep water. Scroll down for video . The lingering drought in California has lowered the water level in Castaic Lake in northwestern LA county so dramatically that a fisherman found a gun, badge, watch and pager belonging to a federal agent . Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Johnny Jones told the Los Angeles Times: 'We knew it'd been there a while when we saw an old pager.' A watch and mini-calendar from 1992 were also found in the backpack. The deputies were able to find the agent who works for the LA County Probation Office. The agent revealed that he had been on the lake one day in 1992 and dropped his bag over the side of a boat, adding that he had gotten into trouble for the mistake. California is suffering its worst drought since 1895, when records began. Combined with unusually warm temperatures and stagnant air conditions, the lack of precipitation has triggered a dangerous increase in wildfires and incidents of air pollution across the state. A recent report estimated that the water shortage would result in direct and indirect agricultural losses of at least $2.2 billion and lead to the loss of more than 17,000 seasonal and part-time jobs in 2014 alone. Such impacts prompted California Governor Jerry Brown to declare a drought emergency and the federal government to designate all 58 California counties as natural disaster areas. Castaic Lake, pictured in May 2014, reveals that the water had started receding slightly from the shoreline . Castaic Lake, pictured four months later in September 2014, showing the dramatic effects of the state's drought with water levels dropping close to 50 per cent . Researchers last month found that California's unprecedented drought is 'very likely' linked to human-caused climate change. They say a persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the Pacific Ocean that diverted storms away from California was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations. It is one of the most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between climate change and California's ongoing drought. Scientists also determined that as long as high levels of greenhouse gases remain, severe droughts could become more frequent. 'California is more likely to see these episodes in the near term,' said environmental scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, who led the study. Despite the findings, Thomas Peterson, principal scientist at NOAA's National Climactic Data Center and one of the report's editors, said it is still hard to definitively link rainfall to climate change. A recent drought-monitor map from California shows that most of the state remains in the emergency 'red zone' this month .","The backpack was spotted by a fisherman at Castaic Lake in north Los Angeles County, California .

"Adam Hathaway, 22, admitted breaching a sexual offences prevention order which was handed to him in 2011 following a string of sex assaults on girls . A convicted paedophile posed as a talent scout to lure children to fake auditions for West End show Matilda and secured a job at a top London theatre to be nearer to kids, a court heard. Adam Hathaway, 22, who was jailed for three years in 2011 for sexually assaulting young girls, invited children to a dance studio for 'fake auditions' despite being prohibited from being in contact with anyone under the age of 18. He also got a front of house job at the Phoenix Theatre on Charing Cross Road, London, and would greet youngsters as they arrived for rehearsals despite being the subject of the ten year sexual offences prevention order which prohibits him from contact with children. The prolific paedophile pleaded guilty to two counts of breaching the order, which was imposed in May 2011, at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. The court heard how Hathaway, who is also known as Adam Barraclough, was first convicted of sexually assaulting young girls in 2011 after setting up bogus photo shoots. He claimed he worked for a fake company called Jungle International and used a string of aliases to fool modelling agencies into sending him children for shoots in Manchester, London and Bolton. He then assaulted the youngsters while pretending to take their body measurements. Hathaway was jailed for 10 months for the offences to run concurrent to a three year sentence imposed at the same time for sexual attacks on two girls, then aged seven and eight, in North Yorkshire. He also made the subject of the ten year sexual offences prevention order at Manchester Crown Court. However, a year later he breached the order after being caught travelling in a car with a woman and her 20-month-old son. Despite not being allowed near children, Hathaway – who was at that time known as Adam Bentley – told the woman he was a professional dancer and she had no idea about his past criminal behaviour. The truth was revealed after the car was involved in a crash and police arrested Hathaway for breaching the order. He was jailed for a further 12 months for being in close proximity to the baby. Today, he appeared at Southwark Crown Court charged with four further breaches of the order. Prosecutor Peter Zinner said: 'Your honour knows that Mr Hathaway is a convicted sex offender. Hathaway got a front of house job at the Phoenix Theatre on Charing Cross Road in London and greeted children as they arrived for rehearsals. He was found guilty of breaching the order by being in contact with kids . 'In relation to count one, the prosecution's case is that he rather audaciously held auditions at a dance studio.' The court heard how Hathaway invited young girls to the premises, including one of around nine years old, with the promise of appearing on stage in the highly acclaimed musical. 2009: Conned aviation bosses into thinking he was an airline tycoon whose company had a £4.5billion turnover and owned high street chains such as Next and Topshop. 2011: Jailed for three years for sexually assaulting two young girls, aged seven and eight, in North Yorkshire. Also jailed for 10 months, to run concurrently, for sexually assaulting young girls after luring them to bogus photo shoots in London, Manchester and Bolton. Handed a ten-year sexual offences prevention order (SOPO) by Manchester Crown Court. 2012: Convicted of breaching SOPO - which prohibits him from having contact with children - after being caught travelling in a car with a woman and 20-month-old child. He was jailed for an additional 12 months. November 2014: Pleads guilty to two further counts of breaching SOPO after luring children to fake auditons for Matilda and getting front of house job at London's Phoenix Theatre where he was in regular contact with young children. Also pleads not guilty at Southwark Crown Court to two counts of breaching the SOPO, in relation to owning a mobile phone which can store video. Police found no indecent images on phone and judge accepts pleas, ordering them to lie on file. Mr Zinner added: 'Again, the Crown say rather audacious behaviour in bearing in mind Mr Hathaway, or his other identity as Mr Adam Barraclough, obtained employment at the Phoenix Theatre. 'That employment was as an operations person who, during the course of his employment as a front of house performer, would have come into contact regularly with young children who were attending various musical adaptations.' Hathaway pleaded guilty to those two charges but denied two others which the judge accepted. The two he pleaded not guilty to related to the unauthorised ownership of a mobile phone which had the capacity to store videos. Forensic analysis revealed there were no indecent images of children on the phone and the charges were ordered to lie on file after the prosecution accepted his guilty pleas for the more serious 'contact' offences. It is understood he will be sentenced on November 24 when he appears at York Crown Court for a mention hearing after he admitted further breaches of the order. Hathaway first hit the headlines five years ago when he was convicted of tricking aviation bosses into thinking he was an airline tycoon. In an escapade likened to the plot of Hollywood Blockbuster 'Catch Me if you Can,' the then 17-year-old boasted his company had a £4.5billion turnover and owned chains such as Next and Topshop. He created fictitious fellow executives of his 'airline' and set up fake websites before he was stopped by police while trying to board a plane in Southend, Essex.","Adam Hathaway, 22, jailed for three years in 2011 for sexual assaulting girls .

"Eastern Ukraine has suffered the worst violence in more than a week as fighting between pro-Russian rebels and government troops in the region killed at least 12 people and wounded 32. Colonel Andriy Lysenko told journalists in a briefing in Kiev this morning that at least nine troops were killed and 27 had been wounded during clashes in Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Luhansk yesterday. Meanwhile, the city council of Donetsk said in a statement published online that at least three civilians were killed and five wounded in overnight shelling of a residential area in the northern part of the city, where fighting has centered on the government-held airport. Destroyed: A burned-out school gymnasium is seen under a clear blue sky in Donetsk this morning. The building suffered a direct hit from a shell last week .

Respect: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko attends a wreath laying ceremony this morning. The event was held for the victims of the Nazi massacre in Babiy Yar, Kiev during the Second World War . Violence has continued despite a cease-fire declared on September. 5. Since fighting began in April, the conflict has claimed at least 3,500 lives. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has been at pains to insist to a skeptical audience at home that his peace plan is working. On September. 20, representatives of Russia, Ukraine, and the rebels signed another agreement that would require both sides to remove all heavy artillery from the frontline, creating a buffer zone that would allow the cease-fire to be better enforced. On Sunday, in the second-largest Ukrainian city, Kharkiv, nationalists tore down an enormous statue of Vladimir Lenin to cheers from the crowd. Across Ukraine, people have torn down statues to the former Communist leader in a symbolic display of anti-Russian sentiment. Hope: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (pictured at a wreath laying ceremony today) has been at pains to insist to a skeptical audience at home that his peace plan is working . Event: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (front row, second from left) and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk (standing next to Poroshenko, wearing glasses) attend a wreath laying ceremony this morning remembering the murder of 34,000 Kiev Jews over two days in September 1941 by the Nazis .

Held: A Ukrainian government soldier detained by pro-Russian rebels peers out of the window of a bus at his masked captor ahead of a prisoner-of-war exchange near Donetsk yesterday . Russia and the European Union will continue talks on gas supplies to Ukraine on Thursday or Friday in Berlin, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said today. He said he had no information about whether Exxonmobil had stopped its operations in Russia. Earlier, a Russian influential business daily reported that the U.S. oil major had halted its operations in Russia to comply with Western sanctions against Moscow. The news comes as it was revealed that  Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend a summit of European and Asian leaders in Italy next month. The summit, which takes place every two years, is being held in Milan on October. 16-17. It would be the first opportunity for Putin to meet with top European leaders since D-Day celebrations in Normandy, France back in June. Since then Putin's relationship with the West has deteriated to unprecedented levels over claims he is not doing enough to stop violence by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. The authorities in Kharkiv supported the move. Arsen Avakov, Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs and a Kharkiv native, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Lenin? Let him fall... As long as nobody gets hurt.' The news comes as France and Germany offered to deploy drones as part of efforts by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation to beef up monitoring of the ceasefire in Ukraine. OSCE spokesman Shiv Sharma said earlier in September the group would initially deploy two drones at the end of the month or the beginning of October, and that more would follow later. 'As requested by the OSCE in Europe, France and Germany have proposed to provide drones aimed at monitoring the ceasefire's implementation,' French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said in a daily news briefing. Despite the September 5 ceasefire, fighting has flared frequently around Donetsk international airport, in eastern Ukraine, which is held by government forces. Seven Ukrainian soldiers were killed when a separatist shell hit their armoured personnel carrier near the airport, a military spokesman said on Monday. Nadal said the drone offer was being studied by the OSCE. He gave no further details. The drones are part of plans to expand the OSCE's mission in Ukraine, where five months of fighting have led to Russia's biggest clash with the West since the end of the Cold War . Captives: A Ukrainian soldier guards detained pro-Russian forces during prisoners exchange near the town of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine yesterday . Released: Members of the pro-Russian forces, who are prisoners-of-war, come out of a bus during a prisoner exchange with Kiev loyalists near the town of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine yesterday . A gigantic statue of Lenin has been torn down by Ukrainian nationalists who cheered and chanted as they cut off the Communist monument's metal nose. Flares and anti-Russian slogans erupted from a crowd of thousands last night as the statue came crashing to the ground in Kharkiv's Freedom Square. The protesters, many of them masked, carved the words 'Glory to Ukraine' on the plinth of the monument, which was destroyed with the permission of the regional government. Goodbye Lenin: One of the largest remaining statues of the Communist leader was torn down last night by Ukrainian nationalists in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which is just 25 miles from the border with Russia . Destroyed: As the 50-year-old monument came crashing to the ground there were cheers and a flare was let off. Ukraine's interior minister Arsen Avakov called it a 'bloody Communist idol' and celebrated its destruction . Even Ukraine's interior minister joined celebrations at the vanquishing of what he called the 'bloody Communist idol'. At around 28ft tall, it was said to be the largest Lenin statue in Ukraine and had stood in Kharkiv's central square since 1964. It came crashing down in a cloud of dust last night after protesters spent several hours taking heavy cutting equipment to the base of the metal monument. With hundreds of voices chanting slogans and the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag draped from the plinth, they took hammers to the statue's face and removed its nose before carrying it through the crowd. Kharkiv is just 25 miles from Ukraine's border with Russia, and like the neighbouring cities of Luhansk and Donetsk it was overrun by gangs of pro-Russian separatists in April. Unlike its neighbours, however, Kharkiv crushed the main uprising just two days later when Ukrainian forces stormed a security services building which the pro-Russians had seized. Around 70 separatists, some of whom were also accused of storming a TV station, were arrested.

"A mother-of-three who vanished as she headed to the Talladega Superspeedway alone nine days ago has still not been found - and police say they have few clues. Theresa Benn's husband Kevin told police he dropped her off near the racetrack early on Sunday October 19, Lincoln Police Investigator Amanda Crow said. She was last seen on Speedway Industrial Drive in Lincoln, which is more than three miles from the track. Authorities do not know if she ever made it to the track, which opened at 5am. Kevin Dulaney, who said he left his wife to walk to the track alone because he did not want to join her at the race weekend, alerted police that she was missing at 7.30pm that day. Have you seen her? Theresa Benn, left and right with her husband Kevin, was last seen in the early hours of Sunday October 19 as she made her way to Talladega Superspeedway . Authorities are looking into reports that she was carrying a purse and a cell phone at the time and they are checking her cell phone records to see if they can determine her location, Crow said. So far multiple tips from people have turned up nothing, she said. 'There's really not a whole lot to go on,' she said. 'We have searched the area and have been responding to tips but we really don't have a small enough area to search yet.' She added that police have interviewed people known to Benn but would not identify them. Crow would not say whether or not foul play is suspected and that it is being treated as a missing person's case for now. Benn, who has two adult children and a 15-year-old, also goes by the name Theresa Andrews Dulaney. Police say they believe she has been married before and Andrews is her maiden name. She was wearing blue jeans, pink cowboy boots, a black tank top and a large, diamond-covered belt and buckle at the time of her disappearance. Missing: Theresa, pictured left and right, was last seen around three miles from the racetrack . Concerns: Theresa, with family, was heading to the track alone because her husband did not want to go . Did she make it?

Mounir Raad (pictured) re-tweeted a disturbing picture of two young boys, covered head to toe with only their eyes showing, holding automatic rifles . Mounir Raad who has associated himself with the Islamic State has claimed he is in Aleppo, Syria. He is believed to have travelled to the country alongside teenager Adam Daham who killed five people in a suicide bombing. Monash University Global Terrorism Research Centre director Professor Greg Barton told the Herald Sun the tweet, was almost seen as a 'badge of honour'. 'In jihadi culture, in a wide range of groups, there is a strong sense of encouraging kids to identify with a military culture as a way forward,' he said. Raad's twitter account has also been filled with a variety of comments giving insight into life under the IS group, which strangely include eating a pot of noodles. 'Mmmmmmm noodles! I feel like a chef,' Raad tweeted. 'We say alhamdulilah for the blessings of Allah s.w.t in some other parts of shaam (Syria) they're eating cats n dogs,' he said. Raad also tweeted a picture of the noodles, indicating what he was eating was obviously a luxury compared with what other fighters had to eat. Mounir Raad tweeted this meaning what he was eating, noodles, was obviously a luxury compared to what his co-fighters have to eat . Raad also tweeted another pro Islamic State comment .

"Foreign nurses, midwives and dentists  will be required to speak a good level of English before they are allowed to work in the NHS, the Government announced today. The clampdown follows concerns that far too many patients are being subjected to poor care on the wards because of communication failings of staff. Nurses from the continent will in future have to have ‘the necessary knowledge of English’ to speak to patients – and could face language tests. Dentists will have to speak a good level of English to work in the UK under plans new Government plans . Regulators will be able to strike off health workers if there are concerns that their English is not up to scratch. Changes were made to enable doctors to be tested for their language proficiency earlier this year. It followed the scandal in 2008 when a doctor from Germany, Daniel Ubani, administered a massive overdose to a pensioner during his first shift as an out-of-hours GP. Leading doctors have warned that the poor communication skills of some EU nurses is putting patients in danger and say their skills are not up to the same standard of British-trained colleagues. Figures this summer showed that the number of nurses from the European Union allowed to work in Britain has doubled in just four years. There are now 20,914 on the register who can practise in hospitals and care homes compared with 10,244 in 2010. In a written ministerial statement today the health minister Dr Poulter paid tribute to the 'contributions that healthcare professionals from all over the world have contributed, and continue to contribute, to our NHS'. But he said: 'It is essential that they have a sufficient knowledge of the English language in order to provide safe patient care.' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt introduced English language tests for doctors and now wants it extended to other health professionals . Dr Poulter said the Government had already introduced language controls for doctors and would now push for the test to apply to other professionals in the NHS. He said: 'Earlier this year, changes were introduced to strengthen the law around language controls for doctors by introducing language controls for European Economic Area doctors wishing to practise in the UK. 'Ministers from the four UK health departments are firmly committed to improving public protection by preventing healthcare professionals who do not have sufficient knowledge of English from working in the UK.'","New test follows concerns that too many patients are  subjected to poor care .

"A century-old time capsule celebrating New York life in 1914 has been unsealed - 40 years later than its creators hoped it would be. The bronze box, filled mostly with documents from long-gone Wall Street businessmen, was meant to have been opened in 1974 but it lay forgotten. Workers wearing surgical gloves removed the 26 screws that had kept the box sealed shut for 100 years in front of spectators at the New-York Historical Society. New-York Historical Society curator of decorative arts Margaret Hofer (left) reacts upon seeing some of the contents of a time capsule from 1914 as art handler Daniel Santiago (right) lifts off the lid during a ceremony . The items uncovered included a collection of documents, booklets and newspapers depicting the  businessmen's interests - from the tea, coffee and spice trade to other commerce, baseball and bullfights. 'This is the thrill of recovering relics,' said Nick Yablon, a professor of American studies at the University of Iowa who is writing a book about time capsules. The Lower Wall Street Business Men's Association deposited the box with the historical society after celebrating the tricentennial of the 1614 charter of the New Netherland Company - one of the colony's pioneering commercial enterprises and a precursor of New York business. The association asked that the time capsule be unsealed in 1974. But that did not happen because the time capsule was forgotten. Nick Yablon, professor of American Studies at the University of Iowa, reads headlines off a 1914 New York Times newspaper which was pulled from a time capsule . Among the books, documents and newspapers sat a photograph of Ellen Jay, a direct descendant of John Jay - the American statesman and diplomat widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of the United States . A telegram from the 1914 New York Gov. Martin Glynn to the current day governor of the state of New York is unfolded after being pulled from a century-old time capsule . A curator discovered it in the society's warehouse in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. Among the books, documents and newspapers sat a photograph of Ellen Jay, a direct descendant of John Jay - the American statesman and diplomat widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of the United States. The box containing the well-preserved papers included another interesting item: a facsimile of a 1774, pre-American Revolutionary War letter written by the colony, now New York, to British colonized Boston, urging that the colonies unite. Fast forward to May 23, 1914, the date of a telegram in the box from then New York Gov. Martin Glynn wishing the New York of 1974 well.

"They were kicked out of office at the last election in the wave of public fury over the MPs’ expenses system. But several former Labour and Lib Dem MPs have been re-selected by their parties to stand in next year’s poll. Dubbed ‘re-treads’, the seven former Labour MPs and two former Lib Dem members will be back on the ballot paper on May 7. Joan Ryan, left, who 'overclaimed' by £5,000 for mortgage interest and Dawn Butler, right, who installed a £2,300 whirlpool bath . They include MPs caught claiming thousands for second homes in London despite their main residence being only a short distance from Parliament. Others ‘flipped’ their second homes so they could claim more for renovating or furnishing the second property. All were entitled to payoffs worth tens of thousands of pounds when they left the Commons. Critics said voters should be made fully aware of the expenses past of the former MPs so they could make up their minds about whether they should vote for them next year. Andy Silvester, Campaign Manager at the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘You’d expect any campaign to mention what these individuals claimed when they last enjoyed the privileges of Parliament.’ Martin Bell, the anti-sleaze campaigner and former independent MP, said voters would ‘think about why they lost their seats in the first place’. ‘Obviously they are entitled to seek re-election,’ he said. ‘It will be up to the voters to make the decision. Their expenses records are out in the open.’ Mike O'Brien, left, who claimed £17.49 for a carbon monoxide detector and right, John Grogan, who claimed £150 for English lessons for a Mongolian assistant . The ‘re-tread’ MPs all faced question marks about their expenses claims at the last election and were booted out of office. Andrew Dismore was Labour MP for Hendon from 1997 until 2010. He claimed £34,000 for his second home, a flat in West London, which housed his girlfriend’s homeopathy surgery. He then ‘flipped’ his designated second home – saying the West London flat had become his main residence – and claimed another £31,000. Joan Ryan became Labour MP for Enfield North in 1997. She spent thousands on repairs and decorations at her Enfield home before ‘flipping’ it to another property. She was ordered by officials to repay £5,000 in ‘over-claimed’ mortgage interest. Andrew Dismore, left, who opposed the reform of expenses and Paul Clart, right, who claimed for rent before flipping his second home . Dawn Butler was Labour MP for Brent Central from 2005 until 2010. Among expenses she claimed for her second home were a whirlpool bath in a bathroom suite that cost £2,308. Paul Clark, the former Labour MP for Gillingham, claimed £1,200 a month in rent for his London flat before ‘flipping’ his second home and claiming mortgage interest on a house in Kent. Mike O’Brien, the former Labour MP for North Warwickshire, claimed £17.49 for a carbon monoxide detector. Former Labour MP for Selby John Grogan claimed £150 on English lessons for a Mongolian intern so he could understand his constituents’ Yorkshire accents. Bob Blizzard, who was Labour MP for Waveney in Suffolk, hit the headlines for claiming 39p for a single paper clip in his expenses. Julia Goldsworthy, who was Lib Dem MP for Falmouth and Camborne, claimed thousands of pounds on expensive furniture only days before the deadline for using up Commons allowances. Former Lib Dem MP Julia Goldsworthy, left, who claimed thousands of pound for expensive furniture and Richard Younger-Ross right who claimed £1,200 for mirrors in his flat . Richard Younger-Ross, who represented Teignbridge in Devon, repaid more than £4,300 on ‘luxury’ items that included £1,200 mirrors at his London flat. A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘All our candidates are committed to upholding the highest standards in office. It was Labour in government who introduced tougher and more transparent reforms to MPs’ expenses.’ A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Julia and Richard are fierce local campaigners with a track record of delivering for their local areas. ‘They have been selected by their local parties because of this record and their desire to build the stronger economy and fairer society Britain badly needs. MPs from all parties were criticised for their expenses and both Richard and Julia made full repayments for any errors they made.’ The Daily Mail is not aware of any Tory MPs who lost their seats in 2010 amid questions about their expenses who have been selected to fight next year. An analysis of the party’s published list of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates suggests none was previously an MP.","Seven former Labour MPs and two ex-Lib Dem members will stand again .

"Researchers have found an unusual glimpse of the beginning of Earth deep in a Samoan volcano. Known as hotspots, volcanic island chains such as Samoa can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years. Researchers now say they have found unique chemical signatures that show them what conditions were like. Waves crash over lava as it flows into the ocean near Volcanoes National Park in Kalapana, Hawaii. Researchers say that volcanoes such as this, and several in Samoa, can contain ancient primordial signatures. Volcanic island chains such as Samoa can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years. Hotspot volcanoes are not located at plate boundaries but rather represent the anomalous melting in the interior of the plates. Such intraplate volcanoes form above a plume-fed hotspot where the Earth's mantle is melting. The plate moves over time — at approximately the rate human fingernails grow (3 inches a year) — and eventually the volcano moves off the hotspot and becomes extinct. Another volcano forms in its place over the hotspot and the process repeats itself until a string of volcanoes evolves. The UC Santa Barbara geochemist studying Samoan volcanoes has found evidence of the planet's early formation still trapped inside the Earth. Matthew Jackson, an associate professor in UCSB's Department of Earth Science, and colleagues utilized high-precision lead and helium isotope measurements to unravel the chemical composition and geometry of the deep mantle plume feeding Samoa's volcanoes. Their findings appear today in the journal Nature. In most cases, volcanoes are located at the point where two tectonic plates meet, and are created when those plates collide or diverge. Hotspot volcanoes, however, are not located at plate boundaries but rather represent the anomalous melting in the interior of the plates. Such intraplate volcanoes form above a plume-fed hotspot where the Earth's mantle is melting. The plate moves over time — at approximately the rate human fingernails grow (3 inches a year) — and eventually the volcano moves off the hotspot and becomes extinct. Another volcano forms in its place over the hotspot and the process repeats itself until a string of volcanoes evolves. 'So you end up with this linear trend of age-progressive volcanoes,' Jackson said. 'On the Pacific plate, the youngest is in the east and as you go to the west, the volcanoes are older and more deeply eroded. Hawaii has two linear trends of volcanoes — most underwater — which are parallel to each other. There's a southern trend and a northern trend.' Because the volcanic composition of parallel Hawaiian trends is fundamentally different, Jackson and his team decided to look for evidence of this in other hotspots. In Samoa, they found three volcanic trends exhibiting three different chemical configurations as well as a fourth group of a late-stage eruption on top of the third trend of volcanoes. These different groups exhibit distinct compositions. 'Our goal was to figure out how we could use this distribution of volcano compositions at the surface to reverse-engineer how these components are distributed inside this upwelling mantle plume at depth,' Jackson said. Each of the four distinct geochemical compositions, or endmembers, that the scientists identified in Samoan lavas contained low Helium-3 (He-3) and Helium-4 (He-4) ratios. The team said the surprising discovery was that they all exhibited evidence for mixing with a fifth, rare primordial component consisting of high levels of He-3 and He-4. Upolu, Samoa: Volcanic island chains such as Samoa can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years. 'We have really strong evidence that the bulk of the plume is made of the high Helium-3, -4 component,' Jackson said. 'That tells us that most of this plume is primordial material and there are other materials hosted inside of this plume with low Helium-3, -4, and these are likely crustal materials sent into the mantle at ancient subduction zones.' The unique isotopic topology revealed by the researchers' analysis showed that the four low-helium endmembers do not mix efficiently with one another. However, each of them mixes with the high He-3 and He-4 component. 'This unique set of mixing relationships requires a specific geometry for the four geochemical flavors within the upwelling plume: They must be hosted within a matrix that is composed of the rare fifth component with high He-3,' Jackson explained. 'This new constraint on plume structure has important implications for how deep mantle material is entrained in plumes, and it gives us the clearest picture yet for the chemical structure of an upwelling mantle plume.'","Ancient primordial signature from the early solar system survived billions of years .

"National Grid was branded  hypocritical today for leaving the lights on at its near-empty headquarters overnight - 24 hours after it warned Britain it faced a power crisis. On Tuesday its bosses said capacity to supply electricity this winter is at its lowest since 2007, which means there could be  a series of 'brownouts' this winter that could dim the lights in millions of homes. But the message has not got through to management who left their vast estate in Warwickshire 'lit up like a Christmas tree' after dark. It came as its experts admitted Britain faces its greatest risk of power shortages in eight years following the closure of coal-fired power stations to meet EU carbon reduction targets. Scroll down for video . Lights are on but nobody's home: National Grid's headquarters brightens the night sky 24 hours after it warned of an upcoming power shortage . Mixed messages: The empty desks belong to the workforce remain lit up despite being outside normal office hours . Clocked off: The near-empty car park with the bright headquarters in the background has been branded hypocritical today . James Robinson, 42, who works nearby, said: 'It's ridiculous that this huge building is lit up like a Christmas tree. 'When we leave our office we make sure the lights are switched off but these people should definitely know better. 'It's a real kick in the teeth for hard-working members of the British public when they announce that we might have our lights dimmed this winter while they are leaving theirs on at night. 'It reeks of hypocrisy - it's just not on.' The  photos were taken at 7.30pm on yesterday and show bright lights coming from every window of National Grid House in Warwickshire. An empty boardroom with some lights left on is also visible and other images show vast car parks with barely any vehicles left in them lit up by a series of street lamps. A National Grid spokesman said: 'National Grid is responsible for making sure the country has a reliable energy supply at all times. To do this, staff work on a number of shift patterns meaning National Grid House is in use 24 hours a day, seven days week. The building itself has many energy conserving measures including sensor controlled lighting which turns itself off automatically if a room is empty'. Their is a stark contrast to the gloomy message put out by the National Grid on Tuesday. Wasteful: The photos were taken at 7.30pm on yesterday and show bright lights coming from every window of National Grid House in Warwickshire . Contrast: Nationally National Grid is taking emergency measures, including paying large factories to turn off their machines during peak periods this winter, in order to keep the lights on across Britain . Empty: One of the vast site's kitchens and a nearby meeting room remained well lit after office hours last night . Defence: National Grid says it runs a 24 hour operation from the headquarters and the buildings have light-saving features . It is taking emergency measures, including paying large factories to turn off their machines during peak periods this winter, in order to keep the lights on. Separately, it plans to pay energy firms millions of pounds to switch on three back-up power stations to cope with high demand if there is a big freeze. Despite this, the National Grid warns it may be necessary to turn down the voltage in the cables to conserve supplies during some periods, which would lead to brownouts. Energy experts say this would not only dim the lights but could also interfere with electronic equipment, computers and electric clocks. The gap between the electricity the nation's power stations and wind farms can produce and demand in an average winter will be 4.1per cent, which is the lowest level in eight years. However, this safety margin would be wiped out for some periods in December and January if the UK suffers the sort of cold winter that is seen once every 20 years. Major energy users say the situation provides damning evidence that the race to close coal fired power stations and switch to wind farms has failed to deliver a reliable power supply. Dr Adam Marshall, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The prospect of energy shortages and rolling blackouts – for factories - is simply unacceptable, as they may cause major disruption for British businesses'. National Grid and politicians insist there is no chance of homes completely losing power - with Energy Secretary Ed Davey saying: 'There will be no blackouts. Period.'","Bosses fear their capacity to supply electricity this winter is at its lowest since 2007, leading to a 'brownout' warning .

"British holidaymakers may regard their mobile as an essential part of their holiday - but how others use theirs while abroad is just as important. Research has found 69 per cent of Brits couldn't live without their phone on holiday, but interestingly, we are the nation that gets most perturbed about fellow tourists' 'mobile etiquette'. Making calls on speakerphone is the main bug-bear according to 55 per cent of British holidaymakers, above the worldwide average. Staying connected: Nearly 70% of Brits admitted they could not go on holiday without their mobile phone . Playing games and videos without headphones, taking photos of strangers and making calls in a restaurant also infuriates us more than people from other countries. British travellers should be forewarned, however, that more than 25 per cent of French and Spanish tourists admit to making speakerphone calls and photographing strangers while on holiday. Globally, it seems that Brazilians and Thais are the worst offenders when it comes to mobile etiquette, with 43 per cent of Thais admitting to filming or photographing people they don't know. More than a fifth of Brazilians said they make calls with on speakerphone in public when travelling. Phone etiquette: Nearly 90% of Brits take more than one mobile device on holiday, according to the report . But although electronic devices are an important addition to our holidays, the loss off these wouldn't affect us quite so much as others. Travellers from the US, Norway, Sweden, India, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand say losing their mobile device when travelling internationally would cause more anxiety than losing their luggage. However the expense of replacing the device would play on the minds of Brits, with 42 per cent saying they would be affected by this, compared to a world average of 37 per cent. A report released on Thursday has highlighted the growing importance British travellers place on their mobile devices, coupled with a strong anxiety of losing them while away. The research, by travel website Expedia, shows that 89 per cent of Brits take one or more mobile devices on holiday, with 69 per cent using their phone for the duration of their trip away. Mobile no-nos: Making phone calls in restaurants are frowned upon, says the survey by Expedia . Contrary to the perception of mobile devices chaining Brits to their workplace even when on holiday, 90 per cent of the UK feel new technology and apps enhance their travel experience; from the initial holiday research, right through to boarding a flight back home we see our mobiles as a 'travel concierge'. More than 35 per cent of Brits polled research their holiday destinations on their devices, with the most popular place for Brits to plan travel being in bed (42 per cent) but for 12 per cent of us the bathroom’s our holiday planning spot. Once abroad, mobiles are increasingly used to manage holiday time, one in four (26 per cent) feel mobile helps them to be more flexible with their travel plans, with 37 per cent using mobile to get tips on the way. More than 27 per cent of Brits have used smartphones to manage their itinerary for business with 38 per cent regarding automatic itinerary updates as an essential function for a travel app. Even for leisure travel we increasingly turn to our smartphones for itinerary management with over 17 per cent doing so. 33% of holidaymakers said they use their mobile data to upload photos to social media while on holiday . Mobiles are the personal assistant we look to for receiving flight alerts for 21 per cent of us, checking in for a flight for 19 per cent. One in ten of us have booked their ground transportation or checked into hotel room via a mobile device. Similarly, almost half of the UK is using maps and navigation functions to find their way around during their holiday. Even abroad, though, it seems the British obsession with the weather is still prevalent, with the data showing checking the weather is more important than using social media, for both UK leisure and business travellers. Thirty-nine per cent regularly make sure the sun will be shining versus only 33 per cent updating their social profiles, while away. 'We are entering a new era where people are move fluidly across desktop, phone, tablet, even wearables as they plan, book and then ultimately take their trip,' said Andy Washington, managing director of Expedia.co.uk . 'Travellers are not only researching and booking trips on mobile, but they’re also complimenting their meals, and capturing every trip detail. 'This is the new normal when it comes to travel. We need to be able to develop relevant products to meet these needs and to offer a consistently high level of service as customers move from one device to another.' Graham Kingsmill, managing director of Egencia UK, said: 'More people each day use their smartphones and tablets to help navigate their business trips. Making calls on speakerphone is the biggest bugbear for 55% of Brits abroad . 'We believe that mobile devices can do more for business travellers and we wanted to understand how. Checking in for a flight or refuelling the rental car before returning it can all be made easier with the right app. 'We have seen that many business travellers will use apps to book hotels at the last minute if these apps feature a great modern experience, and this makes their business travel more productive and cost-efficient.' Despite our reliance on mobile devices abroad, it seems that UK residents are not as savvy as our global counterparts when it comes to data roaming charges. Even though the European Union has capped roaming charges, less than half of UK travellers were aware of this new legislation (44 per cent), compared to 63 per cent of Germans knowing about it. So it seems this will come as welcome news for the 61 per cent of Brits who don’t purchase an international data/roaming plan before going away, allowing them to continue staying connected at all times. Forty-two per cent of Brits admit to spending more than twenty pounds on roaming during a one-week holiday within Europe. On average we spend 33 per cent more than we consider reasonable. It appears that as our business and leisure time converge, the importance of having a connected mobile device when travelling is increasing. Complimentary WiFi and high speed internet are the two most important factors when booking a hotel for both global and UK holiday and business travellers. British business travellers are highly likely to take a smartphone on their travels (82 per cent), compared to only a relatively modest proportion (59 per cent) who take a laptop on business trips, lower than the average across all the markets surveyed.","89% of Brits take at least one device away on holiday .

"A Houston jury convicted Dr Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo (pictured) of aggravated assault on Friday . A Texas cancer doctor has been given 10 years in prison after she was convicted of poisoning her lover by lacing his coffee with a chemical found in antifreeze. Dr. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo, 43, a breast cancer doctor based at Houston's famed Texas Medical Center, was sleeping with her fellow researcher, Dr. George Blumenschein, when he abandoned her in favor of his girlfriend. Although he survived the poisoning, prosecutors say the damage done to his internal organs has knocked years from his lifespan - and urged the juror to consider her crime tantamount to murder. Prosecutors said the affair turned into a 'fatal attraction' and she poisoned him with ethylene glycol after Blumenschein spurned her in favor of Evette Toney, his longtime live-in girlfriend with whom he was trying to start a family. Gonzalez-Angulo was convicted of aggravated assault on Friday. During closing arguments, prosecutors asked jurors to sentence Gonzalez-Angulo to at least 30 years in prison,for stealing years from Blumenschein's life. Blumenschein testified last week that his life span was shortened by the poisoning as he now has only 40 percent of his kidney function. 'Don't feel bad for one second about sending her to prison. She did that herself,' said prosecutor Justin Keiter. Scroll down for video . Poisoned: Dr. George Blumenschein was poisoned after Gonzalez-Angulo dumped chemicals in his coffee, damaging his liver . Defense attorney Derek Hollingsworth asked jurors to sentence Gonzalez-Angulo to probation, saying she should not be judged solely by this one event in her life. He pointed out the work she had done helping patients during her career. On Friday, several patients told jurors Gonzalez-Angulo was a compassionate person who had tirelessly worked to treat them. Sobbing: Evette Toney, Blumenschein's long-term girlfriend, sobbed as she testified at the trial. Gonzalez-Angulo poisoned her lover after it became clear he was leaving her for Ms Toney . Banned: As well as being sent to prison, Gonzalez-Angulo will never practice medicine again . 'It's not the right result to send her to prison for a lengthy period of time ... When you look at the entirety of her life, (probation) makes sense,' he said. Hollingsworth said probation will not be easy for Gonzalez-Angulo as her conviction means she will never practice medicine again. Keiter said Gonzalez-Angulo's good work as a doctor should not excuse her actions. He said probation would not fix what is wrong with Gonzalez-Angulo. 'You cannot fix evil, you can't. You can't fix someone who is cold and calculating and manipulative,' he said. Blumenschein told jurors that he became sick Jan. 27, 2013, not long after he and Gonzalez-Angulo had been intimate, and that he immediately suspected his lover of spiking his coffee. Evidence: Assistant Harris County District Attorney Justin Keiter holds up two coffee mugs during his closing arguments in the trial . Witnesses testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center where she and Blumenschein worked. The defense team had noted a prosecution expert's testimony that Blumenschein could have ingested the poison two days earlier. Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys had argued during the trial that other people, including Toney, might have been responsible for the poisoning, an allegation that Toney has denied.","Dr Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo convicted of poisoning colleague .

State archaeologist later determined the burials were likely part of cemetery dating back to the French and Indian War (1754-63), when Fort Edward was Britain's largest fortification in North America. The skeletons were reburied where they were found, and no excavations have been conducted at the site since. But six weeks after closing on the decade-long effort to purchase the island property, local officials are starting to think about what's needed to turn the overgrown, undeveloped parcel into a public park that will draw tourists to this economically struggling riverside community 45 miles north of Albany. The immediate plans will include trails and signage detailing Fort Edward's key role in the war that set the stage for the American Revolution. So far there have been no discussions on whether to leave the burial site alone or allow archaeologists to return and search for more graves. 'There's not going to be any digging right now,' said Neal Orsini, a restaurant owner who serves on the town board. 'I'm sure down the road there will be discussions about that. We just want to get a basic road map of how to move forward.' More than 250 years ago, Rogers Island was part of a sprawling British fortification that was home to more than 16,000 British and Colonial American soldiers and civilians, making it the third-largest city in the 13 colonies, behind only Philadelphia and Boston. The island, named for Maj. Robert Rogers of New Hampshire, was the base of operations for the frontiersmen he led on scouting and raiding missions in the northern forest. A plaque remembers those buried in the Colonial-era cemetery on Rogers Island . In 1757, after a string of British military disasters, Rogers wrote his 'Rules of Ranging,' 28 guidelines for waging guerrilla warfare in the North American wilderness. They've since been revised and shortened to 19 by the Army Rangers, who still use them to train Ranger candidates at Fort Benning, Georgia. The Rangers consider Fort Edward, especially Rogers Island, to be hallowed ground. State archaeologist Christina Rieth led the team that examined the skeletons after they were found eight years ago. She said all seven were intact, except one that was missing its skull. It couldn't be determined if that body was originally buried without its head, Rieth said. None of the skeletons have been identified. If they are from the French and Indian War, it's likely they were either Colonial militiamen or British regulars, or possibly some of the hundreds of Rangers encamped at Fort Edward during the war, said David Starbuck, who has led archaeological digs here since the early 1990s but never found the cemetery. 'Very few French and Indian War cemeteries have been located,' Starbuck said. 'After years of archaeology on that island, we always wondered where the dead soldiers might be.' A plaque from the cemetery marks the location where the rangers were found .","The town of Fort Edward, New York, is home to a 34-acre parcel of land that is considered the birthplace of the US Army Rangers .

"The body of a large man has been found in the boot of a burnt-out car on a quiet road on the outskirts of Melbourne. Firefighters and police were called to a blaze on the secluded Bulla-Diggers Rest Road just after midnight on Friday when motorists passing the burning car alerted authorities. The body was so badly burnt that police have not yet been able to identify it. But Victoria Police Homicide Squad Detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey has told media he was a 'large man - we'd say he was 100kg plus.' 'We don't know what he has died of at this point in time, but he has been fully engulfed in fire so identity is an issue,' he told AAP. Firefighters made a 'grizzly' discovery of a body in the boot of this Peugeot after being called to the car fire outside of Melbourne early Friday morning . The body of the 'large' man was so badly burnt police are yet to identify him . 'We're hoping we can use dental records to assist us in identifying the deceased, also DNA,' he told Nine News. 'There may be an opportunity for a (finger) print on one hand, but it is going to be difficult.' 'It would have been an extremely confronting and grizzly find for the CFA (Country Fire Authority) members who pulled that boot up early this morning,' said Det Sen Sgt Bailey. Police believe the car, a late-model, possibly yellow Peugeot 407 wagon, was travelling in an easterly direction along Bulla-Diggers Rest Road and was rammed into a fence  before it stopped at Holden Bridge. 'That road takes you down under the Holden bridge where you'd be out of view, and I think that is where they've tried to get to, but the car was too badly damaged as a result of hitting the bollards,' said Det Sen Sgt Bailey.

"Apple is rumoured to be adding a gold colour option for its full size iPad Air (pictured left) which could go on sale as soon as next month . Apple is rumoured to be adding a gold colour option for its revamped full size iPad Air, which is expected to be unveiled later this month. The move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full-size tablets, which are in decline. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours. New versions of the 9.7-inch tablet  could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the iPad Air, ‘people familiar with the matter’ told Bloomberg. The new iPads are predicted to sport a thinner, more rounded design, similar to the iPhone 6. Hidden code in the latest iOS 8.1 beta software hints that the iPads will feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay functionality, The Guardian reported. The code says that users can 'pay with iPad using Touch ID. With Apple Pay, you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information.' However, it is not clear whether the new iPad will come with NFC functionality, which is used for contactless payments, as it relies on a Wi-Fi or mobile connection. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets - available in silver and space grey - more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours (pictured) Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales. The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads this month. 'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/29/retina-imacs-with-os-x-yosemite-in-late-testing-within-apple-could-launch-soon/ . 'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved Wi-Fi antennas,' it says. The firm will also launch a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite. The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their iPhone is in another room. The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser. The software is the first to be overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive. Apple is also rumoured to be launching a larger iPad with a 12.9-inch screen next year, which if true, could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models. The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen. Sales of iPads have slumped for two quarters, after climbing from $5 billion (£3 billion) when they were launched in 2010, to $30 billion (£19 billion)  in 2012 and $32 billion in 2013 (£20 billion). The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens, including recently, Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen. Apple is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales. In 1999 it rolled out different coloured iMacs which were successful, but sales of its iPhone 5C – a ‘budget’ version of the iPhone 5S – have not sold as well as the company hoped. The company is expected to unveil the new iPads at the same time as a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

"Two families have renewed their campaign to find two teenage girls who vanished on Halloween 45 years ago today. Patricia Spencer, 17, and her 15-year-old friend Pamela Hobley went missing on October 31, 1969 after going to a high school football game in Oscoda, Michigan. The girls had told family and friends that they were then heading to a Halloween party - but never showed up. Scroll down for video . Pamela Hobley, 15, (left) and Patricia Spencer, 17, (right) went missing on October 31, 1969 after going to a high school football game in Oscoda, Michigan . The girls, who did not usually hang out together, relatives said, left the school early on Halloween to go to a party but never arrived . Oscoda High School was subject to a bomb threat that day and family members believed that the girls may have left school early that afternoon. According to Missing Persons of America, the girls were not usually known to hang out together. Decades after the mysterious disappearance, relatives of the young women refuse to give up hope. Pamela's sister, Mary Buehrle, told 48 Hours' Crimesider: 'I can't move on. I just hope that someone knows something and will finally have the guts to say something.' Ms Buehrle said she remembered that night as she had gone trick-or-treating with her mother and other sisters. She said her mother, a single mom, was told by Pamela that she was going to a Halloween party with her friends and boyfriend, to whom she had recently become engaged. Patricia's sister told the show that she believed the two girls were picked up by the wrong person and were murdered. Oscoda Township Police Chief Mark David, who took over the case in 2010, also believes that the girls may have been victims of foul play. He said that he wanted to bring the girls home to give their families closure after almost half a century of not knowing. Pamela's mother died without ever finding out what had happened to her daughter, Ms Buehrle said. Chief David has combed over hundreds of old statements and tips involving the case that were not followed up upon at the time. He believes that the investigation got off to a slow start because the girls were deemed runaways. Pamela Hobley (pictured left) would now be 60 and Patricia Spencer (right) would be 61. They are seen in age-progression photographs created by the National Center For Missing Children . Pamela Hobley's sister, Mary Buehrle, pictured, said that she believes someone murdered her sister and her friend 45 yeras ago . The chief said that when he was a teenager it was rumored that the girls had been buried under a barn in Wilber Township, around 11 miles from Oscoda. The tip was never acted upon, Chief David discovered after becoming police chief. Police search teams with cadaver dogs went to the barn but nothing was discovered. Another tip from a witness said that he had given the girls a ride in his car but that turned out to be false. Last year, a new tip emerged from a witness who said that he given the girls a ride and left them at a gas station on River Road. When they were last seen, Miss Hobley was wearing a white fake fur coat wit brown fur trim, a long-sleeved blouse with ruffled cuffs and a brown and white plaid skirt, white kneesocks and shoes with a chunky heel. She had brown hair, brown eyes, a scar on her nose and a birthmark on the left corner of her mouth. Patricia Spencer has brown hair and blue eyes and wears glasses. She was wearing a brown sweater, gray and green plaid jacket, brown tween or plaid skirt, and brown shoes with a chunky heel. She had a silver necklace with a peace symbol on it. Oscoda Township Police Department asked that anyone with information call them at 989-739-9113. Police dug up a barn in Wilber Township, around 11 miles from Oscoda after receiving a tip that the girls were buried beneath it.

"Ebola could cause a major food crisis in Africa if it continues unchecked, and millions of people in the worst-hit countries are already running short as farms are abandoned and trade interrupted, a UN organisation warns. The outbreak of the deadly virus in West Africa is piling more pressure on supplies that are already badly stretched. The global famine warning system is predicting a major food crisis if the Ebola outbreak continues to grow exponentially, and the UN still hasn't reached over 750,000 people in need of food in West Africa. Scroll down for video . A UN agency is warning that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa could cause a major food shortage as farmers in Liberia and other hard-hit nations stay away from their fields . Thursday is World Food Day, and UN agencies and non-governmental organizations are scrambling to scale up efforts to avert widespread hunger. 'The world is mobilizing and we need to reach the smallest villages in the most remote locations,' said Denise Brown, the UN World Food Program's regional director for West Africa. 'Indications are that things will get worse before they improve. How much worse depends on us all.' WFP says it needs to reach 1.3 million people in need in hardest-hit Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. So far, it has provided food to 534,000 people and expects to reach between 600,000 and 700,000 this month, WFP spokesman Bettina Luescher said. 'And we are working hard to reach and scale up to 1.3 million eventually.' Ebola has killed more than 4,000 people and infected thousands more in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The UN's World Food program says 1.3 people in those countries need food aid . The WFP distributing food to outlying towns and villages in countries hit by the Ebola outbreak . WFP is providing food to patients in Ebola treatment centers, survivors of the virus who have been discharged, and communities which have been quarantined or have seen widespread transmission. 'We are assessing how families are coping as the virus keeps spreading,' Luescher said. 'We expect to have a better understanding of the impact of the Ebola outbreak on food availability and farming activities by the end of October.' WFP said its first survey using mobile telephones showed that people living in the Kailahun and Kenema districts of Sierra Leone — where most Ebola cases have been reported — are finding it harder to feed their families than people in other parts of the country and are resorting to more desperate measures to cope. More than 80 percent of people in those areas said they ate less expensive food, and 75 percent reported that they have reduced the number of daily means and were serving smaller portions. Kanayo Nwanze, president of the U.N. International Fund for Agricultural Development, said Monday that up to 40 percent of farms have been abandoned in the worst-affected areas of Sierra Leone and there are already food shortages in Senegal and other countries in West Africa because regional trade has been disrupted. He said preliminary reports suggest that 'trade volume in these markets is half of what it was at this time last year.' Andrea Tamburini, CEO of  the non-governmental organization Action Against Hunger which operates in the hardest-hit West African countries, said his two main concerns are the spike in food costs and the shortage of manpower due to restrictions on movement. This has led to farmers abandoning their crops to seek refuge in locations considered less exposed to the Ebola virus, he said. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said that in Lofa County, the worst affected rural county in Liberia, the price of food and other commodities increased from 30 to 75 percent in August. Action Against Hunger said the price of cassava — a key staple — increased by almost 150 percent in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, during the first week in August. Tamburini said his organization will be running a survey to watch malnutrition rates but giving farmers 'seeds and tools will definitely be there as a first step.' The Famine Early Warning Network said in an Oct. 10 report that if the number of Ebola cases reaches 200,000-250,000 by mid-January, large numbers of people in the three worst-affected countries would face moderate to extreme food shortages. The report said that in this scenario, traders' fears of contracting Ebola and restrictions on movement would severely disrupt the availability of food on local markets, contribute to a significant drop in household incomes, and lead to food shortages at local markets. 'Contingency planning for an expanded emergency food assistance response is urgently needed given that the size of the food insecure population could be two to three times higher than currently planned,' it said. The network was created in 1985 after devastating famines in East and West Africa to provide analysis to help government decision-makers and relief agencies plan for and respond to humanitarian crises.","More than 750,000 people are in need of food aid in West Africa .

"As some of the biggest stars in the world, One Direction are used to be inundated with fan mail. But despite receiving over 700 handwritten notes in just over a fortnight, these boys seem unaffected by their fans' adoration... because these are just the wax figures. Madame Tussauds in Blackpool have revealed that they have been overwhelmed with love letters for the wax stars, who took up residence earlier this month. Undeterred by the fact that these are neither living nor breathing versions of their idols, Directioners have been posting fan mail in their droves to the wax museum. Wax letter: Madame Tussauds in Blackpool have been inundated with fan mail for One Direction . Seeing double: The boy band's wax figures took up residence at the Blackpool attraction earlier this month . The letters have been turning up in the boys' clothing as fans leave behind their love notes after posing for photographs with the group. One letter was found in Harry’s blazer and another was hidden in Louis’s back pocket. Harry has received the most letters with 311, while Niall has been the second most popular so far with 193 notes. Madame Tussauds Blackpool has tasked Guest Experience Host and One Direction fan, Clarissa Croft with handling the letters, and ensuring they’re passed safely on to the boys themselves. Love notes: 'Harry' has received the most fan mail with 311 . 'It’s been surprisingly emotional handling all these love letters from fans,' Clarissa says. 'I absolutely love the band myself, so I know how much One Direction means to them. These guys are the ultimate teenage crush. 'We made the decision to collect the letters to show the fans that they’re support is appreciated and to let the band know how loved they are. 'We’re delighted that the boys are in Blackpool and Directioners have the opportunity to come and meet the boys’ figures face-to face.' Remi Ryles, aged nine from Stoke-on-Trent who took the chance to hand deliver her letter, said: 'I love One Direction so much. I brought in my own letter and gave it Niall, he’s my favourite.'

"Bomb disposal experts rushed to the aid of a man who accidentally fired an entire undetonated grenade into his leg. The unnamed 62-year-old and two paramedics were held outside UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, fearing for their lives from 11pm to 7am on Friday as experts warned one move could kill them all. It was not until dawn that the team decided a disposal specialist could attempt to remove the device - which has a range of 350 meters. Emergency: A 62-year-old man was held in an ambulance outside UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, for eight hours after firing an entire grenade into his leg. ER and surrounding streets were closed off to the public . According to doctors in Jasper, Alabama, the man had arrived at his local clinic bleeding profusely, saying he mistook a genuine bomb for a novelty one and hit it with a hammer. It was not until he was en route to the state's top trauma center that doctors realized it was not a piece of shrapnel but the actual 40mm grenade - which has a 350-meter range. The weapon had failed to detonate because it did not travel far enough when it became lodged. For the next eight hours, from 11pm to 7am, the man was held inside the ambulance on the street outside UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. The entire surrounding area was closed off to the public and people were barred from entering ER. At dawn, the team decided to send in a  U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal specialist out of Fort Benning to remove the device in a 30-minute procedure that could have killed dozens. 'It was pretty nerve-wracking. It was an intense experience,' said paramedic Cameron Padbury, 37, who had to stay in the ambulance with the patient all night. He told AL.com: 'From what they were telling us, if he moved the right way it could go off and we could all die. 'We parked outside the ER with everything barricaded off. 'They had us stationed where it would cause minimal damage and no civilian casualties in case it went off. Only those of us in the ambulance might die.' The team, he said, tried to play down the gravity of the situation but the patient was becoming enraged that he could be taken into the hospital. Fear: Paramedic Cameron Padbury told how he feared for his life faced with a 40mm grenade (stock image) Eventually they explained: 'We told him that he really did have an actual grenade in his leg. 'We were told the only reason it didn't go off was because it didn't rotate enough times or go enough distance.' 'He got pretty upset. He understood there was a possibility he might not make it through. 'He asked us to contact his family, and we did. We left messages for them.' At 7am, when the unit opted to remove the device, Padbury was given the option to leave, but he chose to stay. 'The EOD gave us body armor to put on inside the ambulance while we removed the object,' he said. 'We stayed with him.' Experts have praised Padbury and his colleague for their bravery. 'The Jasper paramedics stayed with the guy all night and saved his life,' said Dave Hyche, a Birmingham supervisor with the firearms and explosives bureau. 'Had it been a high explosive, it could have taken that ambulance apart.' 'It was extremely heroic,' Hyche said. 'Nobody knew this wasn't live. Removing it could have easily killed everyone there.'","Man, 62, shot novelty round that turned out to be real, hit his thigh .

"A sister of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects was led away in handcuffs on Tuesday after a brief court appearance on aggravated harassment charges, which her lawyer said were based on 'an uncorroborated claim'. Ailina Tsarnaeva, 24, who lives in North Bergen, New Jersey, is accused of threatening to bomb a woman who previously had a romantic relationship with her husband. 'Leave my man alone,' she said in a phone call on August  25, according to the criminal complaint. 'Stop looking for him. I have people. I know people that can put a bomb where you live.'

Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Abreu said Tsarnaeva was apparently referencing her brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who had been the subjects of an intense manhunt in the Boston area in the days after the deadly April 2013 marathon bombing. Tamerlan was later killed. Prosecutors said Tsarnaeva had driven past the woman's house since an order of protection was issued. Tsarnaeva's attorney, Susan Marcus, said her client denies making the phone threats. 'My client is an easy target,' Marcus said. 'This is an uncorroborated claim.' Marcus said Tsarnaeva, a mother-of-two including a five-month-old, and her family had 'absolutely no means,' and she did not deserve to be jailed.

The terrifying moment a family car crashes into a lorry at 50mph - and is shunted along the carriageway for 100 yards has been caught on a dashboard camera . The Honda Civic was filmed as it attempted to pull onto the M25 between two lorries . The rear of car is clipped by the front wing of the lorry - causing it to flip sideways and parallel to the front grille . But thanks to the quick-thinking actions of the lorry driver, the Honda is safely brought to a standstill on the hard shoulder. No one was seriously injured in the collision, with news of the crash only emerging after the driver of the Civic filed a whiplash claim. He was blaming the lorry driver for the incident- but the trucker had a SmartWitness camera fitted to his dashboard which filmed the whole incident. The video proved the Honda driver was responsible and his claim against the HGV driver's insurance was thrown out. The lorry driver manages to keep the car safely attached to the front of his vehicle, and away from the centre lane and other traffic . No one was seriously injured in the collision, with news of the crash only emerging after the driver of the Civic filed a whiplash claim . The car is then shunted at least 100 yards down the motorway as the lorry driver tries to keep control of the car . It was one of 550,000 whiplash claims filed last year, with insurance experts estimating around 60 per cent are bogus. The £1 billion-a-year fraud has led to the UK becoming the whiplash capital of the world. There has been a 60 per cent rise in the number of personal injury claims since 2006, according to the AA. This is despite reported accidents on UK roads falling by 20 per cent during the same period. SmartWitness systems, which makes on-board cameras, says it has saved insurance companies £20 million by providing evidence against whiplash and personal injury claims. Sales of the firm's cameras have soared by 40 per cent in two years as motorists protect themselves against the dangers of fraudsters. Simon Marsh, managing director of SmartWitness, said: 'The camera never lies. Increasing numbers of motorists are using CCTV cameras to protect themselves against fraudulent injury claims.'","Honda Civic filmed as it attempted to pull onto the M25 between two lorries .

"Eleven members of the same Brazilian family are in a critical condition in hospital after unwittingly cooking up the world's deadliest fish for their supper, it was reported today. The pufferfish was caught by members of the Souza family while fishing near Duque de Caxias and contained a toxin 1,200 times more lethal than cyanide - a drop of which can kill within 24 hours. The poison paralyses the muscles while the victim remains fully conscious, eventually dying of asphyxiation when the venom reaches the diaphragm. Danger: Pufferfish poison paralyses the muscles while the victim remains fully conscious, eventually dying of asphyxiation when the venom reaches the diaphragm . The Souza family reportedly fried and served up the fish they had been given by a friend who had returned from a day's sea fishing near their home in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro. But seconds after taking their first bite all began to vomit, before losing the feeling in their face, arms and legs. Most of the victims - which include four children aged three to five - were totally paralysed before they could reach a car that would take them to hospital, according to reports. Cristiane Souza, whose husband Jose Augusto, 41, ate the fish, said she had called her extended family living nearby for what she thought would be a delicious fish feast on Wednesday evening. She told Brazil's RJ TV: 'The fish looked so tasty so we invited the whole family. We fried it and everyone tucked in. Treat: Pufferfish are considered a rare delicacy in Japan, but chefs have to undergo two years of rigorous training and be officially licensed to prepare them . Pufferfish are  the second-most poisonous vertebrates in the world, after the golden poison frog. Most contain tetrodotoxin - a substance that makes them foul tasting and lethal to fish. There is enough of the powerful toxin tetrodoxin in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote. Symptoms can include dizziness, exhaustion, headache, nausea and eventually asphyxiation, resulting in death. Pufferfish meat is called 'fugu' in Japan, and is considered a delicacy. It can only be cooked by trained chefs who must cut and trim the fish perfectly to avoid poisoning their customers. Pufferfish range between one inch and two feet long - although they triple in size when threatened. 'My husband was the first to say he couldn't feel his tongue, then his face, and then his arms. Then his legs went dead and he couldn't stand up any more. It was terrfying. 'My brother-in-law was the same. He didn't even make it out the door. We had to carry them out and rush them to hospital in a car.' Grandmother Maria do Carmo said: 'We had no idea it was a pufferfish. They're all in a critical condition. My grandson, my daughter, and my son-in-law, they are all in hospital. We're praying for a miracle. 'We put the fish on the table in the yard outside and everyone dived in. They were all saying how delicious it was.' 'I didn't eat it because I was waiting until everyone had tried it.'

"Sugary energy drinks may have cost athletes  a gold medal at the Olympics, health experts have today claimed. Toothache and bleeding gums affected nearly a fifth of athletes' performances at the London 2012 Games, a new study has found. Nagging pains in the mouth could have made the difference between medals by putting athletes off their stride, it said. The survey found 18 per cent of top sports men and women complained the state of their teeth had a negative impact on their ability to perform. Toothache and bleeding gums could cost athletes the difference between a silver and a gold at the Olympics because nagging pains in the mouth puts them off their stride, health experts have warned (file picture) Nearly half (46.5 per cent) reported they had not visited a dentist in the past year. Saliva helps to protect teeth from decay and erosion, but becoming dehydrated from intense training can lead to a dry mouth, which increases the risk of oral health problems. The amount of energy that athletes need for training often means they have high-carbohydrate diets and regularly use sugary, acidic energy drinks which may also contribute to tooth decay and erosion. But simply flossing, knowing how to brush teeth properly, using fluoride toothpaste and mouthwash could provide the same marginal performance gains as expensive physical therapies, dentists advised. The news comes after a study by German researchers published last month, which found the longer athletes exercised, the less saliva they produced and the more alkaline it became. Alkaline saliva works to encourage the growth of plaque bacteria which causes tooth decay, the team explained. For every extra hour of training each week, the study found an increased risk of a person needing fillings, or having decayed or missing teeth. Hang up your trainers - because exercising could ruin your smile. German researchers found the longer an athlete trains, the more damage they cause to their teeth. They found that the longer athletes exercised, the less saliva they produced and the more alkaline it became. Alkaline saliva works to encourage the growth of plaque bacteria, which causes tooth decay, the team explained. They suggested that running might reduce the enamel-protecting protein found in saliva, meaning even drinking water could lead to tooth erosion. For every extra hour of training each week, the study found an increased risk of a person needing fillings, or having decayed or missing teeth. As part of the study a team of dentists at the University Hospital Heidelberg in Germany examined the teeth of 35 triathletes and 35 non-athletes. Commenting on the results of the new study, health experts at University College London said dentistry must be given the same priority as other sports sciences to help boost their prowess on the track, field or in the pool. Professor Ian Needleman of the UCL Eastman Dental Institute said: 'Oral health could be an easy win for athletes, as the oral conditions that can affect performance are all easily preventable. 'Professional athletes and their teams spend a lot of time and money on ways to marginally improving performance, as this can make all the difference in elite sports. 'Simple strategies to prevent oral health problems can offer marginal performance gains that require little to no additional time or money. 'Things like better tooth brushing techniques and higher fluoride toothpastes could prevent the toothache and associated sleeping and training difficulties that can make the crucial difference between gold and silver. 'We do not want to demonise energy drinks and are not saying that athletes shouldn't be using them. 'However, people should be aware of the risks to oral health and can take simple measures to mitigate these.' He said that water or hypotonic drinks are more suitable for hydration, and told athletes to spit out toothpaste rather than rinsing their mouths out after brushing their teeth. He added: 'For sports where athletes need a lot of energy drinks, high fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinses should be seriously considered.' The advice was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Health experts said sugary energy drinks consumed by athletes might be to blame, and advised that athletes should prioritise oral health in order to boost their performance .","Oral problems affected  a fifth of athletes performances at the 2012 Olympics .

"Blow: The poor result will come as an embarrassing blow to Chancellor George Osborne's Project Merlin agreement . Net lending by banks to cash-strapped businesses collapsed by nearly £10billion last year, figures revealed yesterday. The Bank of England statistics make a mockery of Project Merlin, the Government's attempt to encourage banks to boost credit for companies. The figures come as a survey by financial specialist Bibby Financial Services reveals the owners of small firms are resorting to drawing on personal savings to keep their businesses going. A separate survey of more than 11,000 members of the Federation of Small Businesses showed a third had used their own savings to fund their businesses. The Bank of England figures offer a devastating insight into how five of Britain's biggest banks – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays and Santander – behaved towards firms last year. The figures show that between January and December, net lending – the amount of money handed out by the banks minus the amount that was repaid – slumped by £9.6billion. This means banks received £9.6billion more in loan repayments than they paid out. Overall, the gross lending target to small firms was £76billion, but the five banks managed to hand out only £74.9billion. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Small firms are still finding it too difficult to secure the finance they need.' Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said the promises of Project Merlin 'were not worth the paper they were written on'. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat . peer who resigned over Project Merlin, said the lack of lending was 'a . knife in the back for growth and jobs'. Figures: The Bank of England's 2012 'Trends in Lending' data is not directly comparable with the Project Merlin figures, but shows that net lending to SMEs has actually been falling since 2008 . To blame: RBS which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer, is being blamed for the shortfall after the other four lenders beat their targets . Failure to deliver: Santander, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and RBS saw combined net lending slide in 2011, including a 3 per cent drop in the final quarter . 'Project Merlin has failed to make the banks lend,' he said. 'We must . impose lending targets on our nationalised banks as in our coalition . agreement.' Phil McCabe, from the Forum of Private Business, added: 'Despite the . Project Merlin targets, banks have consistently failed substantially to . increase lending to the small firms that need it most. Under Project Merlin, Britain's top five banks agreed to lend businesses - and especially small businesses - more money in 2011. George Osborne's now rather embarrassing policy, which was finalised in February last year, also sought to make the top five pay less in bonuses than in 2010 and be more transparent about their pay packages. HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS, Barclays and Santander all committed to making £190bn of credit available to businesses last year, up on the £179bn figure of 2010. A figure of £76bn of that was supposed to be made available to small businesses, an increase of 15 per cent on the previous year. The big five also agreed to give £200m to David Cameron's Big Society Bank, which is supposed to finance community projects. An extra £1bn of equity capital over three years was also due to the Business Growth Fund, which helps SMEs in deprived areas of the UK. Project Merlin was designed to help SMEs who complained of being starved of credit since the financial crises. It also aimed to reign in the bonus culture that so incensed the tax payer following the banking collapse and make the City more transparent in terms of salaries and bonuses. However, results show the top five missed their lending target by more than £1bn. Meanwhile, Osborne was preparing to green light more than £500million in bonuses for RBS bankers later this month. 'Lending costs remain punishingly high. We are urging banks to consider a . range of lending risk criteria, such as firms which can show they have . lots of big orders in the pipeline.' However, Mark . Hoban, financial secretary to the Treasury, the overall lending figures were 'good news' and that . lending to British businesses 'has increased by 20 per cent over the last . year as a result of the Merlin agreement, with lending to SMEs also up . by 13 per cent.' 'Ensuring that businesses can access . the credit they need to grow and create jobs is vital, which is why the . Government is now making up to £21 billion of guarantees available . through credit easing,' he said. 'But banks need to play their part by continuing . to support British business going forward.' Under the Project Merlin . agreement, Britain's top five banks also agreed to pay less in bonuses than in 2010 and be more transparent about their pay packets. The lending news comes as the Chancellor is preparing to green light more than £500million in bonuses for RBS bankers later this month. RBS CEO Stephen Hester last month waived his £963,000 bonus but other senior bankers at the firm can look forward to multi-million pound payouts. Meanwhile, the number of small businesses that have used a bank overdraft or loan has fallen in the past two years, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, despite Project Merlin. The survey of 11,000 FSB members found that only 35 per cent has used an overdraft in 2011, 11 per cent a secured bank loan and 7 per cent an unsecured bank loan. The survey also found that 33 per cent of respondents had used their own savings or inheritance to fund their business while 34 per cent got money from friends and family and only 25 per cent used a bank overdraft. John Walker, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'We have long said that targets are the wrong instrument to encourage lending and growth. 'Even though overall lending is above target, this shows that money is going to bigger businesses and not new and fledgling firms that need it to take advantage of growth opportunities that are there even in these challenging times. 'Our research in the last two years shows that around a third of businesses are refused credit and this could be reflected in the fact that newer businesses are using more of their own money to fund their business rather than turn to the banks for help. 'What we need to see is better promotion of the alternatives available and for the Government to put in place their bold credit easing plans, which will help small businesses access finance on better terms.'","Royal Bank of Scotland is being blamed for the shortfall .

"For more than a hundred years the traditional British milkman has been making doorstep deliveries. But now the daily pint is to be delivered by the Germans across much of the country. Surrey-based Dairy Crest has sold all of its dairies and 3,000 milk floats to Bavaria’s Müller for £80million. End of an era: Mark Allen, chief executive of Dairy Crest, said it didn't matter who owns the company . Müller – which sells dairy products around the world – will take control of four dairies at Severnside, near Bristol, Chadwell Heath, east London, Foston, Derbyshire, and Hanworth, in Birmingham, as well as around 70 depots. Mark Allen, chief executive of Dairy Crest, said: ‘It may be owned by a German firm but consumers love the milkman – it doesn’t matter who owns the company.’ It marks an end of an era for Dairy Crest, as milk represented around 70 per cent of their business. The firm will now focus on their Country Life butter and Cathedral City cheese brands. Mr Allen added: ‘In the months ahead we will do all we can to minimise the uncertainty that we know today’s news will bring for the many people associated with our business.’ Dairy Crest, Britain’s largest dairy food company, has struggled to pass on higher raw milk prices it paid to farmers last year and has been losing customers to supermarket chains, which offer cheaper milk. The company’s dairies swung to a loss of £4.4million for the six months to the end of September from a profit of £2.6million a year earlier. The deal adds to Müller’s growing presence in the British dairy industry. In 2012, the firm took over Scotland’s Robert Wiseman Dairies and already owns nine dairies and ten depots nationwide, employing almost 6,000 people. Ronald Kers, chief executive of Müller UK & Ireland, said: ‘We are concerned that the dynamics of the UK fresh milk market are unsustainable for dairy processors in the mid to long term. This acquisition will allow us to reduce our costs, increase our efficiencies and invest in the future.’ Dairy Crest is the latest in a string of once-proud British institutions sold to foreign firms. Four years ago, Cadbury was sold to American processed cheese maker Kraft while just this week Twiglets maker United Biscuits was bought by a Turkish firm. The Chinese own Weetabix and the Japanese own Sarson’s vinegar. In 2003 another British milk giant Express Dairies suffered a similar period of poor profitability and was bought by Swedish-Danish firm Arla. They in turn sold it to Dairy Crest in 2006. The British milkman first appeared in the 1860s when the rail network meant fresh milk could be transported around the country cheaply and quickly, direct from the farm. Milkmen took the milk door-to-door in churns on a three-wheeled ‘milk pram’. The pram has now evolved into an electric float and the milk is now decanted into pint bottles, but otherwise doorstep deliveries had, until now, withstood the tests of time.","Surrey-based Dairy Crest has sold its dairies and milk floats to Müller .

"With the most instinctive extension of his leg at the far post last night, Miroslav Klose moved one step closer to immortality. This is how the really great goal scorers do it; without fuss. It’s their job and to people like Klose it comes naturally. In scoring the 15th goal of his remarkable World Cup career, the German centre forward – on as a second half substitute – edged level with the Brazilian Ronaldo at the top of the all-time table. Perhaps just as importantly to him, he moved ahead of his compatriot, the great Gerd Mueller. VIDEO Scroll down for Klose in training with Germany squad before his fourth World Cup .

GOALS: Ayew 54, Gyan 63 . REFEREE: Sandro Ricci . But, most importantly of all, Klose saved his team and his nation last night. Reeling from a stunning Ghana assault midway through the second half, Germany were trailing 2-1 in Fortaleza. For a few moments they looked as though they would join Italy, England and Spain in the World Cup hall of shame. Important players do important things, though, and when the big German defender Bendikt Howedes rose to flick on a corner 19 minutes from time, Klose was in the right place to earn his team a point. In recent times, Klose has replaced the somersault that used to follow his big goals with a simple pump of the fist. Last night, though, the acrobatics were back. 'I don't know how long it’s been since I did a somersault. but at least it worked out,' he smiled afterwards. Klose now has 70 international goals to his name from 133 games. It is a remarkable record and he had been tied with Mueller in the World Cup list since he scored twice in a 4-0 quarter-final win over Argentina four years ago in Cape Town. Level best: Andre Ayew (right) rises above the German defence to head home for Ghana . No chance: A full stretch Manuel Neuer is unable to stop Andre Ayew equalising for Ghana . Saviour: Andre Ayew celebrates scoring for Ghana against Germany on Saturday night . These days, of course, he is not first choice. Bayern Munich’s Thomas Muller is the modern go-to man and Klose perhaps arrived in Brazil not expecting to see much action. This was his first appearance of the tournament and his goal came from pretty much his first touch. Germany needed it, too, as another night of gripping, unexpected drama threatened to provide us with one more upset. How odd that was, too, as Germany did look as though they were going to coast to the top of the group with maximum points after shading the first half and then taking the lead. The German midfield functioned brilliantly at times in the opening period with Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil imposing himself on the tournament for the first time after a quiet game against Portugal and Toni Kroos looking the measured, astute passing footballer we know him to be. There were chances for the Germans during this time but they couldn’t take them. They almost scored a super goal in the eleventh minute as a Muller back heel gave Kroos the chance to shot. The ball may have found the corner, too, had it not struck a defender’s shin. Kroos and Ozil were combining very well as the half progressed and the two of them created an opening for Sami Khedira in the 18th minute only for the goalkeeper to save. Ozil then crossed low from the right for Muller who was denied by a tackle from John Boye. Stunner: Asamoah Gyan fires past Manuel Neuer to put Ghana ahead against Germany . Dancing feet: Asamoah Gyan and his Ghana team-mates celebrate in spectacular after going 2-1 up . Momentum was certainly building for Germany but for a while they couldn’t break through. Kroos shot over from distance and then Ozil chipped a pass through for Mario Goetze, whose volley found the goalkeeper’s midriff. Goetze was eventually to score the opening goal but he had to wait until the 51st minute to do it. A cross from Muller deep on the right found the Bayern Munich player squeezing in between defenders and his header ended up in the net off his own right knee. In the lead at last, Germany looked set to consolidate as they often do. It didn’t happen, though, and three minutes later Ghana caught them cold with an equaliser before taking the lead and turning the whole night on its head. Again the cross came from the right for the equaliser and it was Andre Ayew who climbed above the static Shkodran Mustafi to head powerfully to Manuel Neuer’s right and in to the corner. Good Christian: Atsu tries to curl the ball around Mats Hummels as Ghana search for a goal . Flexible: Jonathan Mensash spectacularly falls to the ground during Ghana's game with Germany . For Germany to concede one goal was careless but for them to concede again a few minutes later was criminal. This time they were architects of their own downfall as they gave the ball away in midfield and watched the superb Asamoah Gyan race away and score powerfully with his right foot. With Ghana energised and full of adrenaline now, Germany all of a sudden looked a different team and the Africans poured forward. Had the irrepressible Gyan found the corner instead of Neuer’s midriff after flying down the left in the 66th minute then the game could have been over. As it was, Klose and Sebastien Schweinsteiger were sent on immediately and after the former scored the latter ambled forwards to head another chance over. In to the final stages and Germany could have won it. The breaking Muller was tackled brilliantly by Kwadwo Asamoah and then – two minutes in to added time – Klose spurned the chance to make history.

Rooney added: 'We will go out there fighting, show our pride. But overall we are disappointed and you know it is not a great feeling to go out of the tournament after two games so we want to try and restore some of our pride back.

'You can't lose your first game at a World Cup,' he said. 'It's really tough to recover from. 'If we hadn't won it maybe we would still be in. That's the biggest lesson.' The Manchester United striker is confident England will recover from the early exit. 'The three best young players in the Premier League are Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw and Raheem Sterling,' he said.

"A teenager beat his five-year-old foster brother to death has been acquitted on the grounds of insanity after claiming he believed he was defeating a goblin. Cody Metzker-Madsen bludgeoned Dominic Elkins to death in the garden of their foster home in Logan, Iowa, last year while the pair were playing. The 18-year-old then drowned him  in a pool of water at the bottom of a ravine and dumped the body. The pair had only been in the house for a couple of weeks, both being removed from their biological parents, before the attack took place. Today, he was found not guilty of murder in a bench trial after waiving his right to appear before a jury. Harrowing: Cody Metzker-Madsen, 18, (left) has been found not guilty of murder after he bludgeoned his five-year-old foster brother Dominic Elkins (right) to death in the garden of their foster home in Logan, Iowa . Fantasy: Testifying in court, Metzker Madsen said he was in his 'own world' during the attack and thought Dominic (pictured) was a goblin attacking him . An autopsy showed Dominic died of blunt-force head injuries and drowning. Prosecutors argued that Metzker-Madsen gave different stories for why he killed the boy and was able to lead his foster family to Dominic's body. Metzker-Madsen also faces an assault charge, as authorities say he bit a jailer on Tuesday. During harrowing testimony on the first day of his murder trial, he told the judge that he was playing a game based on Roman mythology with the youngster and was transported to 'his own world' before he is suspected of killing him. Metzker Madsen then claims he saw 'green, ugly little creatures' that were fighting people he knew. The scene was similar to something from Skylanders, a video game the teen played, he said. During the harrowing account Metzer Madsen said he 'fought the goblin's commander' and pushed him into ravine. 'I remember attacking him with it and smashing it into his face,' Metzker-Madsen said. 'At that very moment did you realize it was Dominic?' the teen's attorney Michael Williams asked. 'No, I did not,' the teen responded. 'I started pushing his head into the water as I was hitting him with a brick.' The teen said he wanted to keep the goblin to make sure it wouldn't come back to life and fight him. Goblins are 'kind of tricky little creatures,' he said. However, talking about Dominic, he said: 'I loved the little guy, I would never hurt him. Not even a hair on his fricken' little head.' Fantasy: Metzker Madsen (mugshot taken last year) claims he saw 'green, ugly little creatures' that were fighting people he knew and remembers smashing the brick into Dominic's face - but didn't realize it was him . Devastated: Barbara Kunch, Dominic's biological mother, left the courtroom as Metzker-Madsen described the attack on her son . After killing the goblin commander, Metzker-Madsen said he was called out of the ravine by a screaming ally who needed his help. His 'vision' ended after he helped the other person. He then went to tell his teenage foster sister that he couldn't find Dominic. The biological mothers of Metzker-Madsen and Dominic sat in the courtroom and cried as the teen testified. The boys were both in the care of Julie and Don Coolman at the time who were also raising their own children. They haven't spoken publicly about the death. Barbara Kunch, Dominic's mother, left the courtroom as Metzker-Madsen described the attack on her son. She put her son into foster care because he had behavioral problems and did not know how to handle him. The five-year-old would throw uncontrollable tantrums and physically abuse others. That aggressive behavior had apparently come under control in recent days after he received months of therapy at a local treatment center before he was put into the Coolman's care. Metzker-Madsen said that he only realized he was involved in Dominic's death when he was in a car a short time later. He also got frustrated during cross-examination by assistant attorney general Denise Timmins. Witnesses to tragedy: Don Coolman pictured with his twin 12-year-old daughters, who discovered their foster brother dead in a ravine . Prosecutors noted that Metzker-Madsen provided more than one story for why Dominic died and was able to lead his foster family to his body. On cross-examination, Metzker-Madsen said he told different people varying versions of the stories depending on a symbol that only he could see on top of people's heads. 'You don't really believe me, do you?' the teen asked Timmins at one point. Metzker-Madsen's biological mother, Peggy Madsen, also took to the stand. She told the court how she would use $20 of crystal meth a day for three months while she was pregnant with him. She had custody of him until he was seven and claimed that he grew up having imaginary friends and likened himself to a Power Ranger. The teenager has been kept isolated in prison since last year.","Cody Metzker-Madsen, 18,  found not guilty of murdering Dominic Elkens, 5 .

"From the tops of the thighs to the sides of the bosom, it seems there's very little flesh that celebrities are unwilling to flash. Now the A-list have a new erogenous zone to show off thanks to summer's super-short shorts - the underbutt. Among those with the nerve to show of a glimpse of buttock are Cara Delevingne, Tulisa Contostavlos and the usually demure Ellie Golding. Now that's what we call short! Tulisa Contostavlos and singer Ellie Goulding show off their assets in shorts . Classy: Rihanna's shorts are less Daisy Duke and more thong as this candid shot reveals . A perennial favourite, this season . saw shorts climb higher up the leg than ever with designers sending a . mixture of distressed Daisy Duke cutoffs and teeny tailored bottom . skimmers down the summer catwalks. The . High Street has also gotten behind the trend with bottom-skimming . shorts hitting the shelves at Topshop, while ASOS has made its Daisy . Dukes tinier than ever. American Apparel has also gotten in on the act with its teeny skin tight 'Disco Shorts' - yours for £50. Others to adopt the tiny shorts trend include Rihanna who pushed the boundaries in a pair  that were less sneak peek and more full moon, while Abbey Clancey was spotted in a pair of teeny shorts at a party in Milan. Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, is a serial offender and has been pictured flashing her underbutt on numerous occasions. While shorts have rarely hit the heights of the current crop, they've long caused raised eyebrows in polite society. Although boys have been wearing shorts for centuries, it wasn't until 1890 that a culotte type garment was invented to enable women to take advantages of the newly invented bicycle.

Other famous bottoms to have been spotted in the skimpiest of short shorts include Kylie Minogue, whose gold hotpants worn in the video for 2000 single, Spinning Around, launched a thousand male fantasies, and the Duchess of Cambridge who was pictured in a yellow pair at a charity roller disco.

"Chinese media reports that two University of Southern California students from China were murdered in their luxury BMW because they were 'showing off their wealth' has caused outrage among the victims' friends. Couple Ying Wu and Ming Qu, both 23, were sitting in the . 3-series when a gunman fired at the vehicle shattering the car . windows. The woman, Wu, was found slumped in the front passenger . seat in the early hours of Wednesday morning near the campus in Los Angeles. Tragic: USC students Ming Qu, 23, left, and Ying Wu, 23, right, were shot dead in a BMW on Wednesday . Blown out: The windows of the BMW luxury car were blown away; Ying Wu was found slumped over in her seat, and Qu tried to get out for help . Mourning: More than 400 Chinese students participate in a memorial service on campus of the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, for the murdered couple . The wounded man, Qu, managed to run to a nearby home, where he . pounded on the door pleading for help but soon collapsed. In . a statement released on Thursday, classmates and friends of Wu and Qu . said they are 'deeply grieved and angered at the distorted reports of . our friends', reports the LA Times. As news of the shooting broke, media outlets first reported that Wu was found dead in a new BMW. Headlines in China have focused on the make of the car because luxury vehicles have become a political issue in the country. But . in their statement, friends say Qu had recently purchased the BMW, . which was in fact a used 2003 model with 80,000 miles on the clock. He . had planned to use the car to commute to a job after graduating this . spring. They said the car had no license plates because they had not yet arrived and not because the car was new, reports the Times. Rebecca Peterson lights candles at an impromptu memorial on campus for the two international students . Evidence: Police believe they were murdered either in an attempted robbery or car-jacking that left material evidence behind connecting to the suspects . 'Ying and Ming lived a simple life . during their nearly two-year study at USC. In order to keep their living . expenses down, they both shared rooms with other classmates. 'Ying even chose to live on the west side of campus, where it is comparatively cheaper and less safe.' The friends ended the statement by imploring people to 'ignore the rumors and help tell the truth', reports the Times. Paramedics took the victims to . downtown's California Hospital Medical Centre where they were announced . dead on arrival, authorities said. 'This is every parent's nightmare,’police Cmdr. Andrew Smith told the Associated Press. The couple were both graduate students from China studying electrical engineering, the university said in a statement. Prestigious: As many as 35 per cent of USC's international student population is comprised of the Chinese . Rough around the edges: The neighbourhood, though gentrifying, is in a seedy area of Los Angeles . Investigators say it may . have been a robbery or a carjacking attempt. Witnesses said the car was . in the roadway, not at the curb, at the time of the shooting. The . gunman fled and no one has been arrested, Cmdr. Smith said. Police have . taken the BMW away for examination and were attempting to determine if . there were any surveillance cameras in the area. Four people have been killed this year in the area, police said, but violent crime is down 20 per cent this year. Gloria Tigolo lives on the street . where the shooting occurred and said she heard a single gunshot. She . went downstairs but didn't go outside because it was raining. 'It was . just one big shot,' she said. 'I am amazed that one gunshot could kill . two people.' Investigators said earlier that several shots were fired at the couple. Ms Tigolo said the area is peaceful . and this is the first shooting she can recall since she moved to the . neighbourhood three years ago.","Students Ming Qu and Ying Wu shot dead in their 3 Series BMW .

"Derby manager Steve McClaren is still getting it right in the League Cup – 10 years after making his managerial name by winning the competition with Middlesbrough. Every big decision McClaren made on Tuesday paid dividends as Derby cruised into the last 16 with second-half goals by Johnny Russell and a late Alex Pearce own goal.

Then, he threw on last season's top scorer Chris Martin for the final quarter and the striker played an important part in both goals. On top of that, Liverpool winger Jordan Ibe was in thrilling form as he continued his successful loan spell at the iPRO stadium. 'We made six changes but out football continued.

Derby dominated first-half possession and their best chance fell to Leon Best who forced a smart save from Mikkel Andersen. But, with the interval approaching, Derby defender Cyrus Christie hit a dreadful backpass straight to Mackie and was relieved Kroos spread his 6ft 5in frame to keep the game goalless. 'It was a good opportunity and the first goal was always going to be important,' rued Reading boss Nigel Adkins. Derby didn't let Reading off the hook. Ibe rattled the Reading crossbar via Andersen's fingertips and just after the hour McClaren sent on last season's top scorer Martin for teenager Will Hughes, who impressed on his 100th appearance for the club. Within three minutes, Derby were ahead, with Martin inevitably involved in the move that allowed Russell to run through from midfield and fire low past Andersen. 'A terrific finish,' purred McClaren.

"Award: Mary Berry has received the icing on the cake in the form of a CBE awarded by the Prince of Wales . The doyen of British baking Mary Berry has received the icing on the cake in the form of a CBE awarded by the Prince of Wales. The much loved cookery writer said she is 'immensely honoured' to receive the accolade that marked a career writing recipes and preparing meals for the nation for more than 40 years. Charles hosted the investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle in place of the Queen who pulled out to rest a sore back as she would have been standing for the hour-long event. Mrs Berry, 77, said she was pleased to meet the Prince for the first time: 'This is a lovely finale to the year and I’m immensely honoured and proud to be here but I could not have done it without the support of my family and friends.' She has become a household name to a new generation of cake lovers thanks to her role as a judge, alongside Paul Hollywood, in the BBC’s popular show The Great British Bake Off. The highly anticipated series final will be broadcast next Tuesday when remaining contestants John Whaite, Brendan Lynch and James Morton battle it out for the title. Asked about the show’s appeal, she said: 'This is not a hyped-up programme. It’s totally sincere. We aim to get people baking and to enjoy it and to further their skills. 'It’s very tough but they are friendly to each other and we encourage them, we don’t want to make them cry. 'I think the audience enjoy it because . it’s fun, and they get attached to the characters who, although they are . competing and dying to win, they still help the person next to them and . borrowing spoons and things.'

Meanwhile, a former RAF Chinook helicopter pilot emulated his grandfather when he was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross by Charles. Jon Singh, an ex-Flight Lieutenant, landed his aircraft safely in Afghanistan after it was raked by insurgent gunfire that left it almost unflyable, with a round passing inches from his right foot. His maternal grandfather, Flying Officer David Bhore, was presented with the same military honour in 1944 for flying reconnaissance missions for the Royal Indian Air Force over Burma during the Second World War. Mr Singh, 32, from Bristol, whose mother is English while his father is Indian, played down his actions and said: 'It was putting into practice hours and hours of training. It was not just me there were four of us there, it was a crew effort.' Mary Berry on television in 1979 explaining how to cook roast turkey at Christmas and also how to carve . Describing the military operation he took part in during June last year, the former pilot, who is now studying for a masters in international relations, said: 'We were carrying Royal Marines and their job was to fight their way into a compound where the Taliban was manufacturing IEDs (improvised explosive devices) that cause so much havoc. 'We started coming under fire as we were coming in to land, we were hit several times whilst on the ground. 'Normally flying the Chinook is like driving a car with power steering but this was like driving a bus without power steering, one of the rounds had damaged the controls, we had lost a couple of other systems, but the most critical was the damage to the controls which meant the physical flying was very difficult.' The Chinook limped to a Nato base around 10 miles from the compound and landed safely in a field. 'There was a question of how we were going to fly, and to where we were going to fly, but we were relatively calm.' Mr Singh added, laughing: 'I’ve listened back to the (cockpit) recording and there’s only one swear word - but right at the end.' Speaking about his grandfather, who died when he was a boy, he said: 'He was from that generation that didn’t really talk about the war so it’s only in the last few months I’ve really found out more.'","Mrs Berry, 77, says she is 'immensely honoured' to receive the accolade .

"London Underground services were expected to return to normal this morning after huge delays and disruption caused by a 48-hour strike over ticket office closures. Fresh talks will be held today to try to resolve the bitter dispute which sparked the strike. The walkout by members of the RMT and TSSA unions officially ended at 9pm last night, but a further 48-hour stoppage is planned from next Tuesday evening if there is no deal at the talks. Some commuters claimed at around 11pm last night that some stations on the network were still closed - two hours after the strike officially ended. However, Transport for London had earlier warned that services would still be disrupted after 9pm yesterday, and had urged people not to 'leave it too late to travel'. On board: London Mayor Boris Johnson takes the tube on the District Line to Southfields, during the second day of a 48-hour shut down of some of the network due to industrial action over the closing of ticket offices . Packed platform: Commuters wait to board a limited-service Tube train at Victoria station in Central London . Union officials will meet London Underground (LU) under the chairmanship of the conciliation service Acas after several days of previous talks failed to end the dispute. LU said more trains ran to more destinations and more stations yesterday than on Wednesday, but passengers still faced disruption to Tube services, and long queues at bus stations and on roads. Journeys on the capital's Barclays bicycle hire scheme were up by 50 per cent for the second day, although wet and windy weather persuaded many people to work from home. LU managing director Mike Brown, who had urged the unions to bring forward the meeting, said he was grateful for the ‘patience’ shown by passengers. The unions have been urging London mayor Boris Johnson to meet them to discuss the closures, which will see the loss of 950 jobs. Val Shawcross, Labour's transport spokeswoman on the London Assembly, has written to the mayor urging him to launch a full public consultation on the plans to cut jobs and close all ticket offices. Getting in: Commuters arrive at King's Cross Underground station during the Tube workers' strike yesterday . Chaotic scenes: Commuters wait to board buses at King's Cross station during the Tube strike yesterday . Aerial view: A Metropolitan Police helicopter photograph of a congested Trafalgar Square during rush hour . ‘The mayor and TfL must hold a public consultation on the plans to cut station staff and close all Tube ticket offices. Londoner Tom Dixon, who lives near Hyde Park Corner Underground station, called MailOnline to lament that he was expecting his local station to be open last night - but it was still shut at 11pm. He said that he also walked to Knightsbridge at about the same time - and that was also closed, adding: ‘The whole thing is that they're not going to start operating trains until this morning. ‘When the strike is officially over and things are back to normal, everyone expects that things will have been running for the last few hours of the (previous) day. This is the ordinary public screwed.’ And journalist Alex Clark sent a tweet to Transport for London at 11.52pm saying: 'Can you say why we were told Tube would reopen at 9pm Thurs? Many stations still closed. Better for passengers to be clear.' Her sentiments were echoed by Twitter user Patrick 'sunpat', who asked TfL in a message at 10.51pm: 'Why when the strike finished at 9pm are there still Tube stations closed?' A TfL spokesman had said on Twitter last night just before 8pm: 'Strike is scheduled to end around 9pm but services will still be disrupted. Please don't leave it too late to travel.' ‘There are some interesting ideas in . TfL's plans and modernisation is needed, but Londoners should be given . the chance to have their say and improve them. ‘No one has a monopoly on good ideas and Boris should be willing to listen to what the public have to say. ‘The unions have raised legitimate concerns over passenger safety and how more vulnerable Tube users will be affected by the changes.’ The mayor has refused to meet the unions unless they call off the industrial action. RMT leader Bob Crow said: ‘Our negotiators are geared up and ready to enter the exploratory talks.’ TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said it was time for the mayor to ‘get serious’, claiming that 70 per cent of the network was at a standstill yesterday. ‘We want no more stunts or PR baloney from Boris. No more talk of a secret army of volunteers marching to London's rescue. ‘We want serious and detailed talks on our genuine fears for the safety and security of passengers and staff under these far-reaching plans. ‘If that happens, I believe we can reach a settlement that will avoid next week's 48-hour walkout.’ TfL said almost three out of four Tube stations were open yesterday, with services running on nine out of 11 lines, although trains were not stopping at some stations. There were no services on the Circle or Waterloo & City lines, and nothing through the central area of the Piccadilly line. Keeping order: A police officer helps commuters to board buses at King's Cross station during the strike . Piling on: Commuters board a limited-service London Underground Victoria Line train at Victoria station . Crowds: Commuters wait to board a Victoria line Tube train at King's Cross Underground station during strikes . Mr Johnson said: ‘I understand how frustrating this has been for many Londoners and I'd like to thank them for their patience and stoicism during this completely unnecessary strike. Thousands of Metropolitan Police civilian staff plan to strike for two days next week, coinciding with the next Tube walkout, in a separate row over pay. Members of the Public and Commercial Services union will stop work on Wednesday and Thursday in protest at the imposition of a 1 per cent wage rise. General secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'It ought to bring shame on the Met Police that staff who help to keep London safe are being driven into the arms of loan sharks because of low pay. 'The Met Police is not short of money and does not have to ape the Government's politically motivated pay policies that have fuelled the longest decline in wages on record.' ‘I am grateful to the London Underground . staff who rejected this pointless action and worked, and to the hundreds . of volunteers who are helping passengers through the day. ‘I'm . pleased that having failed repeatedly to engage in constructive talks . around TfL's modernisation plans, the unions have agreed to sit down . with TfL at Acas. ‘Rather than hurting hard-working Londoners and hard-pressed small businesses, they should have been talking to TfL this week. That the unions won't negotiate until after the strike is over tomorrow says a lot about their failure to engage. ‘If, as they claimed yesterday, Mr Crow and Mr Cortes are happy to embrace modernisation, new technology and change, then what on earth are they doing on strike when these changes do just that and involve no compulsory redundancies?’","Fresh talks today to try to resolve bitter dispute which sparked the strike .

"Passengers on an Air France flight were asked to 'chip in for fuel' after their plane was forced to land in the strife-torn Syrian capital Damascus. The jet from Paris had been heading to Beirut, Lebanon, when fighting broke out on the main road to the airport on Wednesday night. The captain first decided to divert to Amman in Jordan before realising he did not have enough fuel to get there. Money: Crew on the Air France flight asked passengers to chip in for fuel after the jet landed in war-torn Syria . So he requested emergency permission to land in Syria, where rebels are battling to overturn President Bashar Assad's tyrannical regime. Once on the ground in Damascus, the crew told the 174 passengers they could not use the Air France 'company credit card' to refuel the plane because of financial sanctions imposed on Syria by the west. They then asked the mainly French and Lebanese travellers how much cash they were carrying to pay for the thousands of litres of kerosene needed to reach Larnaca in Cyprus - the nearest safe airport. A 42-year-old passenger named Najib said: 'We went down in Syria where there were lots of soldiers looking very threatening. Diverted: The plane's captain diverted to Damascus after realising he did not have enough fuel to reach Amman in Jordan . 'We were then told there were some problems and that there was no money to pay for the fuel. 'They asked if the passengers could contribute for the refueling which could only be paid for in cash.' But the Lebanese businessman added: 'As . people were rummaging through their handbags and wallets, we were told a . solution had been found to the problem.' A 23-year-old engineer called Roland . tolkd France's AFP news agency later: 'We could see through the window a . lot of haggling going on because Air France's fuel account with . Damascus had been cancelled after they stopped flying in March. Dangerous: Syria has been torn apart by fighting during the past few months . 'Because of the terrible relations between France and Syria, a lot of the passengers were very worried about landing there.' An Air France spokesman later confirmed to AFP that the passengers had been asked for money after in landed in Damascus on Wednesday. He added: ""The crew at first offered to pay for the fuel in Damascus with a credit card but the transaction was impossible because of financial sanctions. 'As a precaution and in anticipation, the crew asked how much money the passengers had in cash to pay to fill up with fuel. 'However a solution was finally found to fill up the plane without borrowing cash from the passengers and the plane took off for Larnaca two hours later.' The plane flew on to Beirut the following day, he said. In December last year, passengers on board a flight with Austrian airline Comtel Air were asked to pay for fuel during a stop in Vienna after the carrier ran out of cash.","Captain diverts to Syria after realising he does not have enough fuel to reach Amman in Jordan .

"Tyson Fury has pulled out of his fight with Alexander Ustinov after his uncle was taken ill. Fury had been due to fight Ustinov on Saturday evening but pulled out of the heavyweight clash after his uncle and former trainer Hughie was taken to hospital on Saturday morning. In a statement released by Queensberry Promotions, Hughie was said to be 'seriously ill' and Fury's camp therefore took the decision to 'pull him out of the fight rather than risk his health by sending him into the right with his mind not focused.'

"One of the senators behind stricter background checks for gun sales struggled to hold back his tears when he met families who lost someone to the Sandy Hook massacre. Senator Joe Manchin spoke to those who lost loved ones when crazed gunman Adam Lanza opened fire at the school in Newtown, Connecticut. Manchin a Democrat, and Republican Patrick Toomey reached a bipartisan agreement on . background checks, improving prospects for gun control legislation that . Obama has been pushing for. Scroll down for video . Grief: Senator Joe Manchin (left) becomes emotional as he meets with families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown . Senator Manchin (seated on his own, right) hosted Newtown families in his Washington office on the day he announced that he had reached a bipartisan deal on expanding background checks on gun buyers . Obama said while it's not his bill and . he wishes parts of it were stronger, the deal represents significant . progress and if enacted would make it harder for dangerous people to . obtain guns. Senators plan to hold an initial vote Thursday . to begin debating gun legislation. Obama says there is a lot of work . remaining to enact gun control measures, including getting them through . the Republican-controlled House. He's calling on senators not to block . consideration of the bill and for Americans to stay engaged. Senators Manchin and Toomey said their accord would help keep firearms from . criminals and the mentally ill. Subjecting more firearms purchases to . federal background checks has been the chief goal of Obama and gun . control supporters, who promote the system as a way to prevent criminals . and other potentially dangerous people from getting the weapons. United: Mark Barden and Jackie Barden, parents of slain Daniel Barden, hold hands while meeting with the senator . David and Francine Wheeler (left), who lost their six-year-old son Ben in the shooting. Mark Barden, father of slain Daniel Barden (right) Deal: Senators Joe Manchin (left) and Pat Toomey (right) proposed the deal on background checks for firearm purchases . Even so, the ultimate fate of gun . legislation remains unclear, clouded by opposition from the National . Rifle Association (NRA) and many Republicans and moderate Democrats in the . Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-run House. The NRA said Wednesday the group is unequivocally opposed to the plan and threatened to punish lawmakers in its ratings system. 'Expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools,' top NRA lobbyist Chris Cox wrote in a letter sent to senators Wednesday night. 'Given the importance of these issues, votes on all anti-gun amendments or proposals will be considered in NRA's future candidate evaluations.' The . agreement between two of the most conservative members of each party . was expected to make it even likelier that the Senate's initial vote . Thursday to begin debating gun legislation will succeed, despite an . effort by conservatives to block consideration of the measure. The proposal by Sens. Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey would expand background checks to cover all sales at gun shows and over the Internet. Those background checks would have to be accompanied by records proving to law enforcement officials they took place.It would also exempt gun sales and transfers between friends and acquaintances without the help of an online intermediary. 'Truly the events at Newtown changed . us all,' said Manchin, referring to the Connecticut town where 20 . first-graders and six educators were shot down in December, launching . the country into renewed debate over gun violence. 'Americans on both . sides of the debate can and must find common ground.' 'I don't consider criminal background checks to be gun control,' said Toomey. 'I think it's just common sense.' The administration was continuing its . effort to pressure Congress on gun control on Wednesday as first lady . Michelle Obama planned to visit a high school in Chicago, the Obamas' hometown, where authorities say 29 current or former students have been . shot in the past year. Currently, the background check system . covers sales only by licensed gun dealers. The compromise would apply . the system to all commercial sales, such as transactions at gun shows . and online. The sales would have to be channeled through licensed . firearms dealers, who would have to keep records of the transactions. Private transactions that are not for profit, such as those between relatives, would be exempt from background checks. The Obama administration has continued its efforts to pressure Republicans in restricting firearms, with Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder speaking at the White House Tuesday joined by law enforcement officials . Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who led an . earlier unsuccessful effort to strike a bipartisan background check . deal, is backing the compromise after changes were made from an initial . version of the deal between Manchin and Toomey, according to a Senate . aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe details of the . talks. The changes included eliminating . language that would have required states to recognize permits to carry . concealed weapons issued by other states and eliminating language that . would have limited background checks to sellers who sell at least five . guns annually, said the aide. Some Republicans might vote to begin . debate on the legislation but eventually oppose the measure on final . passage. Other parts of Obama's gun effort already seem likely to face . defeat, including proposed bans on assault weapons and high-capacity . ammunition magazines. Subjecting more firearms purchases to federal background checks has been the chief goal of Obama and gun control supporters . The gun legislation Reid wants the . Senate to debate would extend the background check requirement to nearly . all gun sales. Reid would try to replace that language with the . Manchin-Toomey compromise once debate begins, a move that would require a . vote. The overall gun bill also tightens federal laws against illegal gun sales and slightly increases federal aid for school safety. Thirteen conservatives have signed a . letter saying they will block consideration of the measure, and Senate . Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he will back that move. That will force Democrats to round up 60 votes to overcome the . conservatives. At least eight Republicans have said . they want to begin debate or have indicated a willingness to consider . it, a number that would be expected to grow if the background check . agreement proves successful. Some moderate Democrats were remaining . noncommittal and could oppose opening the gun debate. There are 53 . Senate Democrats and two independents who lean Democratic. Amid the maneuvering, relatives of . some Newtown victims are lobbying to support gun curbs. And Obama has . been calling senators from both parties to push for the gun bill. 'People should listen to what we have . to say and move the debate forward,' said Mark Barden, who lost his . 7-year-old son, Daniel. 'It's not just about our tragedy. Lots of kids . are killed every day in this nation. We have to help lead the change.'","Senator Joe Manchin met with families of victims of the massacre .

"This is the horrifying moment 11 passengers found themselves trapped inside a London Underground station after striking workers locked up before the last train dropped them off. The commuters were locked inside South Ruislip station in freezing conditions for almost an hour until a station employee returned to free them at 1am on Thursday morning. Passengers called out for help after getting off a Chiltern Railways train at around midnight to discover the gates had been closed and locked. Passengers called out for help after getting off a Chiltern Railways train at around midnight to discover the gates had been closed and locked . Some of the passengers stranded at South Ruislip station were forced to climb over barbed railings to escape . The station, which provides mainline train services as well as Metropolitan Line underground connections, closed earlier than usual at 11pm due to the strikes. Passenger Beren Reid, 22, said: 'The tunnel that goes under the mainline tracks and onto the station concourse had been shut off and padlocked at the point where it joins the underground passageway. 'From there we could see that the exits at the front of the building had also been shut off, and we tried calling out and rattling the gate to get the attention of tube staff but nobody came.' On realising they were stuck, passengers called British Transport Police, who told them that an officer would be sent but could take up to 90 minutes. Taking matters into their own hands one passenger hopped the fence and scavenged car parts from a nearby garage to build a makeshift ladder to help six of the ten other passengers get out. Mr Reid added: 'One person managed to climb over the railing on the Southbound platform of the mainline station, and came round to the front to shout through the gates to inform us of an escape route. 'We were all weary, freezing, and angry that we would have to wait 30 minutes or more for help. 'The first person had to resort to parts of cars found near the car repair company based in the dark and dinghy service road adjacent to the station, to give the six other people daring enough to scale the fence a stepladder to get over. 'Once over the railing, they found themselves atop large commercial waste bins with flimsy lids that were six feet off the ground, but thankfully they all managed to get over safely.' A dozen passengers were trapped for almost an hour at South Ruislip station in north west London on Thursday morning . The 48-hour London Underground strike ended yesterday evening but many still reported disruption across the network. During the 48 hour strike there was no service on the Waterloo and City, Circle or Bakerloo lines. The Picadilly and Central lines didn't operate through central London but services continued through some outlying stations. The Jubilee and Victoria lines continued operating trains every five minutes throughout the strike but over a reduced distance. The District and Metropolitan lines operated a severely reduced service with some station closures and trains ran on the whole of the Northern Line but 17 stations were closed. When contacted today, Transport for London (TfL) claimed the mistake was nothing to do with them and was instead the fault of Chiltern Railways for dropping off the customers. Chiltern Railways' Operations Director Andrew Munden said: 'We are incredibly sorry that our passengers were affected in this way, particularly on a day when travel in London was significantly disrupted. Passengers called out for help after getting off a Chiltern Railways train from at around midnight to discover the gates had been closed and locked . 'We are unique in that over half our stations in London are owned and staffed by London Underground. 'Serving these stations during a strike is a challenging and complex logistical exercise, as we are dependent on London Underground for many services including, on part of our route, signalling of trains. 'Despite these challenges, we took the decision to operate our full train service and allow passengers to travel, rather than cancel trains and inconvenience hundreds of customers. We had no indication that South Ruislip would be locked and, in fact, it had been open the night before with no issue. 'We hugely regret that our passengers were inconvenienced in this way, and will be reviewing our procedures with London Underground for future strikes. 'The reason this happened, however, was a direct consequence of us working hard to ensure we could provide a service to London Underground owned stations that would otherwise have gone without.' A Transport for London spokesman said: 'The Chiltern Railways train dropped them off after the station closed. 'It was nothing to do with us other than our staff let them out.' Central Line Operations Director Peter McNaught said: 'After South Ruislip Underground station had been closed for the evening, we were made aware that around 15 customers of Chiltern Trains, which also serves the station, had mistakenly got off at the station. 'We immediately sent a member of staff to open up our gates so that the customers could make their way home.' Transport for London had earlier . warned that services would still be disrupted after 9pm yesterday, and . had urged people not to 'leave it too late to travel'. Commuters wait to board a limited service Tube train during the strikes . TfL said almost three out of four Tube stations were open, with services running on nine out of 11 lines, although many commuters were forced to find other ways of getting to work . London Underground services returned . to normal this morning after huge delays and disruption caused by the . strike over ticket office closures. Fresh talks will be held today to try to resolve the bitter dispute which sparked the strike. The . walkout by members of the RMT and TSSA unions officially ended at 9pm . last night, but a further 48-hour stoppage is planned from next Tuesday . evening if there is no deal at the talks. Journeys on the capital's Barclays bicycle hire scheme were up by 50 per cent for the second day, although wet and windy weather persuaded many people to work from home. Mike Brown, managing director of London Underground, who had urged the unions to bring forward the meeting, said he was grateful for the ‘patience’ shown by passengers. The unions have been urging London mayor Boris Johnson to meet them to discuss the closures, which will see the loss of 950 jobs. London Underground said eight of 11 lines were running trains, keeping London ""open for business"", but unions said the company had under-estimated the impact of the 48-hour walkout . LU said more trains ran to more destinations and more stations yesterday than on Wednesday, but passengers still faced disruption to Tube services, and long queues at bus stations and on roads . The mayor has refused to meet the . unions unless they call off the industrial action. RMT leader Bob Crow . said: ‘Our negotiators are geared up and ready to enter the exploratory . talks.’ TfL . said almost three out of four Tube stations were open yesterday, with . services running on nine out of 11 lines, although trains were not . stopping at some stations. Mr . Johnson said: ‘I understand how frustrating this has been for many . Londoners and I'd like to thank them for their patience and stoicism . during this completely unnecessary strike. RMT leader Bob Crow has said: 'Our negotiators are geared up and ready to enter the exploratory talks' London Mayor Boris Johnson has refused to meet the unions unless they call off the industrial action . ‘I am grateful to the London Underground staff who rejected this pointless action and worked, and to the hundreds of volunteers who are helping passengers through the day. ‘I'm pleased that having failed repeatedly to engage in constructive talks around TfL's modernisation plans, the unions have agreed to sit down with TfL at Acas. ‘Rather than hurting hard-working Londoners and hard-pressed small businesses, they should have been talking to TfL this week. That the unions won't negotiate until after the strike is over tomorrow says a lot about their failure to engage. ‘If, as they claimed yesterday, Mr Crow and Mr Cortes are happy to embrace modernisation, new technology and change, then what on earth are they doing on strike when these changes do just that and involve no compulsory redundancies?’","Commuters trapped inside South Ruislip station in north west London .

"Helmet manufactures Masuri say they will 'seek as much TV and video footage as possible' after Phil Hughes was left fighting for his life after being struck in the head while wearing one of their products. Australian batsman Hughes is in an induced coma in intensive care after being knocked unconscious by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match on Tuesday. Masuri say that their thoughts are with Hughes and their family but claim he was wearing one of their old models, and new equipment is available which offers extra protection. They claim he was 'struck in a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets cannot fully protect'. WARNING Some pictures and video in this story may be distressing . Masuri released this graphic to illustrate how their old 2013 helmet may not 'fully protect' the batsman . Batsman Phil Hughes collapsed and hit the ground face first at the Sydney Cricket Ground this afternoon after being struck in the head by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match .

The left-hander, who has played 26 Tests for Australia and been involved in three Ashes series, has been visited in hospital in Sydney by many of his team-mates, past and present. The  opener, according to Cricket Australia, was 'struck on the back, lower left side of the head when he turned away as he followed through with an attempted pull-shot to a regulation short-pitched delivery from young NSW quick Sean Abbott'. Pictures from the Sydney Cricket Ground also show the ball hitting Hughes in that place, and as the 25-year-old fights for his life, questions are now being asked about player safety. Masuri said in a statement that Hughes was wearing its 'Original Test model' when the incident occurred, but that has now been superseded by the 'Vision Series' which has a new helmet and grille profile. There can be no confirmation as to whether the incident could have been avoided regardless of what Hughes was wearing, but Masuri says it is constantly looking to make improvements. The statement said: 'Following the injury to Phil Hughes, Masuri is actively seeking as much TV and video footage of the incident as possible, to be able to see more conclusively exactly where the player was hit. 'Masuri would immediately like to join with the world of cricket in wishing Phil Hughes a full and speedy recovery. 'From the footage and pictures currently available to Masuri, it appears that Phil Hughes was struck by the ball to the rear of the grille and below the back of the shell, missing his Masuri Original Test model helmet.

England's former batsman Kevin Pietersen also tweeted his best wishes . Ex-England spinner Graeme Swann called Hughes 'a cracking bloke' and wished him well for a full recovery . The front cover of Wednesday's Daily Telegraph in Australia reflected the goodwill for Hughes . 'This is a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets cannot fully protect, while enabling batsmen to have full and proper movement. 'The newly-developed Masuri Vision Series helmet, which supersedes the 2013 helmet worn by Phil Hughes, does afford batsmen extra protection in this region – and still allows comfortable movement.' Masuri Managing Director Sam Miller said: 'The thoughts of everyone at Masuri are with Phil Hughes and his family. 'Helmet manufacturers are constantly developing their products to make them safer. 'We work continuously with the governing authorities worldwide to reduce the risk of injury to players.' The 25-year-old, playing for South Australia against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), was struck on the side of his helmet by a Sean Abbott delivery and collapsed face-first to the ground shortly afterwards. It is now a tense wait for the loved ones and cricketing colleagues who rushed to his bedside - including Australia captain Michael Clarke - to hear if Hughes' surgery was successful. His family has released a statement which said 'the outcome of that surgery is unlikely to be known for the next 24 to 48 hours.'","Australia Test batsman Phil Hughes underwent surgery and in a critical condition in a Sydney hospital .

"By GWEN JAMES . War of words: James Middleton, 25, has struggled with reading and writing all his life . When James Middleton walked down the aisle of Westminster Abbey to deliver his reading at the marriage of his sister – to a global television audience of two billion – he had more reason than most to be gripped by anxiety. He knew the eyes of the world were upon him but it was his own struggle with reading that was his biggest concern. His reading turned out to be a masterclass in measured oratory, made all the more remarkable by the fact that James still struggles to read because of his dyslexia – a broad term to describe a common learning difficulty. As a boy, even reading to a class of his peers terrified him. To ensure a word-perfect delivery at Westminster Abbey, he had to rewrite the biblical text into a version he could understand. Speaking now to raise awareness on behalf of the British Dyslexia Association, he recalls: ‘I had to retype the whole of the reading phonetically, and that’s how I learnt it. ‘In that way I became confident in it, and then I felt I was perfectly capable of doing it. At the end of the day, whether it was in a little church or Westminster Abbey didn’t matter, it was me, as a brother, doing a reading for my sister and her husband at their wedding and I wanted to do it right.’ As anyone who watched him will surely agree, the words were moving. The speech was followed, naturally, by an enormous sense of relief. ‘Yes, there was definitely a big sort of sigh afterwards,’ he says, smiling. Indeed, today, James, 25, appears every inch the confident young businessman, but this comes only after years learning to manage his dyslexia, which he was formally diagnosed with at the age of 11. Daunting: James Middleton retyped a biblical text phonetically so he could read it at his sister Kate's wedding to Prince William . Word perfect: But when the moment came, his reading was spot on without a hitch . Long before that, problems with reading and writing had been flagged up by his teachers. At primary school in Berkshire, James recalls being given extra lessons, and being issued with magnifying bifocal spectacles to help letters on the page stand out. ‘I was fine with numbers but it took me a longer time to grasp simple things like spellings,’ he says. ‘I used to spell everything phonetically, or  I would have little tricks for words I could not figure out. ‘So “said” was Sally Anne Is Dead, and “because” was Betty Eats Cakes And Uncle Sells Eggs. Words that had double letters completely baffled me. At that stage it wasn’t a particular issue though – I just found it a bit of a pain to have these extra lessons because I wanted to be outside playing.’ Proud moment: James wanted his reading to be right for his sister and Prince William . At 11, his struggles were such that he was asked to sit a  literacy exam, after which he was formally diagnosed as dyslexic. ‘There was some relief in that, because a lot of the strain comes from trying to hide it,’ he says. By 13, however, enrolling at Marlborough  College – the prestigious fee-paying school his sisters attended – stepped up the pressure. ‘Spelling and reading are something you’re expected to be able to do by then, so if you struggle at them, it’s not the easiest,’ he says. ‘I even had a little rhyme to learn how to spell Marlborough as my father said I would never get in if I couldn’t even spell the name of the school.’ In common with other children with literacy issues, James dreaded any form of public performance. ‘When I read out loud in class it was a joy for everyone else because I would mispronounce things so badly,’ he recalls. ‘I used to try to count how many  people were in front of me and then work out which paragraph I would have to read out and start trying to learn it. And I would sit there thinking, “Please let the bell go so that it doesn’t get round to me.’’ ‘There was a certain amount of teasing but I built up a bit of resilience and I was competent in other areas. There were other boys in the same boat, too.’ Many dyslexia sufferers struggle with concentration and retention of information but James – whose maternal grandfather was dyslexic – says that these were never real difficulties for him. His coping strategies centred on painstaking preparation and, on occasion, smoke and mirrors. ‘I realised that if I could write the first two letters of the word then put a squiggle, as if it was bad handwriting, people would fill in the gap,’ he recalls. School time: James, pictured centre on a class trip aged 13, hated exams because of his condition . Close family: James pictured with his father Michael, mother Carole and sister Pippa . Going his own way: James left university to start up his own business, The Cake Kit Company, which makes personalised cakes . Nothing, however, could erase the . horror of exams – not even being allotted extra time. ‘Exams are the . most crucifying thing for someone who is dyslexic because you feel you . cannot justify yourself, it does not reflect your true capacity,’ says . James. ‘It’s . frustrating because it’s not a lack of understanding: you almost need to . write your own question about the topic so you can really show what you . can do.’ Dyselxia is one of the most common learning disorders, according to Dr John Rack, head of research for Dyslexia Action. One in ten people in the UK has  the condition to some degree, with  it running in families. Most experts now agree on its central symptoms. ‘An accumulation of evidence shows that core difficulties centre in the way language is processed,’ says Dr Rack. ‘In particular, there are problems with analysing and breaking down spoken words, which also seems to lie at the root of dealing with problems with written words. 'This is what makes learning to read particularly difficult. 'Alongside that, it is quite likely you are going to find trouble concentrating, or the inability to retain a lot of information at the same time. ‘Probably only half of those diagnosed have severe difficulties where they need a lot of support – for the rest it’s entirely manageable. ‘For anyone with dyslexia, if  you get help and learn to develop coping mechanisms and strategies, you can almost  always find a way through.’ Dr Rack believes that genetic screening is not an entirely distant prospect. ‘We know dyslexia runs in families and we know quite a bit about some of the genes involved in passing it on,’ he says. ‘Imaging studies show there are different degrees of connections and patterns in the language area of the brains of those with and without dyslexia. ‘Although this is not something we can currently use diagnostically, there is exciting research into very early indications, even in babies.That could potentially lead to  well-timed intervention.’ And so, . despite hours of study,  his A-level grades were not good enough to . secure a university place, meaning retakes at a local sixth-form . college. It was, he admits, a tricky period, . particularly for his mother and father. ‘I used to say that I didn’t . fail the exams, it was the exams that failed me. It was my teenage ego . saying that, but actually it’s sort of true,’ he says. ‘But it didn’t . make things easier at the time: I had very capable sisters who had . succeeded in exams, then I came along and naturally my parents didn’t . know what to do because I applied myself really well to work, and they . fully were expecting me to go to university – as did I.’ Successful retakes allowed him to . take up a place at Edinburgh to study environmental geosciences and . rural resources management in 2006. Yet after two weeks, James says, he . knew university wasn’t for him. ‘I knew I was going down the wrong . path. I stayed for a year, but then I made the decision to leave. It was . against everyone’s advice because I’d retaken my exams to try to get in . and then there I was giving it up.  But I never feel I dropped out – I . was just ready to move on and do something different.’ The . decision meant giving up  his independence to move back home. But this . only boosted his determination to create his own  success story. Within . a few months he had started his own business, the Cake Kit Company, and . now runs a parallel business, Nice Group, which specialises in . personalised cakes. ‘I didn’t look back really,’ he says. ‘University is great but it wasn’t right for me.’ These . days, he says, he is entirely comfortable with the fact he is dyslexic, . even if it does mean committing the occasional professional blooper. ‘I . had 1,000 business cards printed this year, but I had to throw them in . the bin because I spelt “personalised” wrong,’ he reveals. ‘Not ideal, . given the thing I do is personalised cakes. But I just looked at it and I . could not see it. ‘I do make lots of spelling mistakes . still – for a time the word “corporate” on my website was spelled . “coprate”. But I’m not embarrassed. The way I see it, it is part of me. The key is to become completely confident about it.’ Having this outlook . could be helped by earlier diagnosis, and some experts believe that . genetic screening for the condition will eventually be possible. For James, the notion is a welcome one, although he maintains he would not change the man he’s become. ‘If I had a choice I would still choose to be dyslexic, because I feel it helps me see things in a different way,’ he says. ‘There is a talent in dyslexia, it can help you see things creatively. So I wouldn’t change a thing.’ Additional reporting: Flora Bradley-Watson .","The Duchess of Cambridge's brother was diagnosed with dyslexia when he was 11-years-old .

"First they were accused of trying to cash in on the royal wedding, then they breached strict advertising laws surrounding the Olympics. But this time, the Middletons seem to have offended an even more formidable foe: James Bond. Just days before the new Bond film, Skyfall, was released, their party company was advertising apparently unlicensed 007 merchandise, urging online shoppers to throw their own ‘secret agent’ event. The Party Pieces website featured an advert dedicated to the movie, complete with the James Bond Skyfall logo, its release date and an iconic black and white picture of the film’s star, Daniel Craig, seen through the barrel of a gun. In hot water: Carole Middleton, right, with children Pippa and James, and husband Michael . But the Middletons’ keenness to make money out of the phenomenon appears to have raised eyebrows among the legendary Broccoli family, who not only produce the Bond films but own – and jealously guard – all product, image and merchandising rights. A spokesman for their UK-based firm, Eon Productions, told the Mail they were aware who owned Party Pieces, set up in 1987 by the Duchess of Cambridge’s mother, Carole Middleton. They said the issue had been passed on to the marketing and legal department – meaning that Party Pieces is very likely to be unlicensed to thrill. Eon Productions was founded by Albert R. Broccoli, who died in 1996. It is now owned by his daughter, Barbara Broccoli, and stepson, Michael G. Wilson, who also produce the Bond films. The spokesman added: ‘It is not something we comment on but the film makers are very protective of everything they have built up. 'It is something we take very seriously.’ The offending advert: It has now been removed from the website . The situation is particularly awkward as the Duchess of Cambridge’s father-in-law, the Prince of Wales, and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, were guests of honour at the royal world premiere of Skyfall last week, where they met Daniel Craig and the Bond cast as well as Miss Broccoli. Hours after the Mail contacted Party Pieces and Eon Productions on Friday, the offending banner disappeared from the company’s website. But it is not clear whether the removal of the advert was the result of any threatened legal action from the Bond producers, as Party Pieces did not respond to a request for comment. The goods, which are still available, are listed under the heading ‘James Bond Secret Agent Party’. They include a £3.99 table centrepiece made up of two paper martini glasses and a stiletto shoe, and tuxedo-shaped gift boxes for 50p each. The firm also sells ‘0’ and ‘7’ silver helium balloons at £6.99 each, and gold plastic martini party glasses for £1.49 a pop. It is not the first time that the Duchess of Cambridge’s family has run into trouble over marketing issues. Earlier this year they were asked to amend their website after falling foul of strict advertising laws covering the London Olympics with a range of Games-themed goods. They were also accused by Britain’s Got Talent of illegally carrying its logo on their website and criticised for cashing in on the royal wedding with a range of themed items including corgi cake toppers and British trivia scratch cards. Although the business’s accounts are not publicly available, the firm is clearly a money-spinner for the Middletons, who recently bought a £4.7million country home and have put their three children through private school. It is a remarkable achievement for Mrs Middleton, who started the business from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table.","An advert dedicated to the movie, complete with the James Bond Skyfall logo, has now been removed from website .

"Chelsea assistant first-team coach Steve Holland has told the Blues' fringe players to look to the example of Frank Lampard ahead of the Capital One Cup third-round tie with Bolton. The Blues plan to rotate their line-up for the visit of Wanderers, who have one Championship win this season, during a congested period.

Maybe that's why he has had the career he has had. 'And I would suggest that is probably a good line for others to follow.' Goalkeeper Petr Cech, second choice this season behind Thibaut Courtois, is among those who could get an opportunity alongside young talent. French defender Kurt Zouma, 18-year-old Danish defender Andreas Christensen, English midfielder Lewis Baker and Dutch defender/midfielder Nathan Ake - who has already graced the first team - are all in contention. The quartet were retained in Chelsea's first-team squad this season while 26 others went out on loan. 'No matter whether you are old or young, you want to play,' Holland said. 'And if you don't want to play, you shouldn't be here. That's how you want your players to be. Managing that on a day-to-day basis is a challenge. 'We're hopeful whoever gets the chance to play will stake a claim for a place long term - that's the objective.' Nathan Ake could be another Chelsea youngster who gets an opportunity to impress on Wednesday night . Lampard scores the equaliser past Thibaut Courtois in Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Chelsea . Lampard remains a  legend with the Chelsea fans after his 13-year spell at Stamford Bridge . The Bolton contest comes as the second of five games in 14 days, with Aston Villa, Sporting Lisbon and Arsenal to follow. 'We need all of our players,' Holland said. 'One of the most difficult challenge that a manager at a big club has (is that) you don't just have a team of very good players - you have a squad of very good players. 'That sounds good, but there is a flip-side to that. Without being disrespectful, that's a challenge for Liverpool this year. 'They have a bigger squad of more quality players and picking the right ones for the right matches and the ongoing communication with all of them and keeping them chomping at the bit is a challenge. 'There does come a point when they do need to play. And we are entering a period now where I'm sure that will occur. 'We have total faith in all of our squad. Jose has said he is very happy with the squad.'","Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland says Chelsea's youth players should look up to the example Frank Lampard set at Stamford Bridge .

"A British hedge fund company is about to cash-in this week on a surprisingly secure investment - Madonna. The organisation bought more than 140 Madonna items, mostly costumes and jewellery she wore during her movie and singing career. The goods included dozens of outfits from the 1996 hit musical Evita as well as the star's peach baseball dress and glove from her 1992 movie 'A League of Their Own' and a vest top and jeans she wore for her music video of American Pie. Scroll down for video . The ivory silk ball gown worn by Madonna in her Golden Globe - winning role as Eva Peron in Evita (1996) is estimated to reach  Est, $4,000 - 6,000 (£2,499 - £3,755) The Atsuko Kudo couture latex black waspie (corset) worn by Madonna on the cover of V magazine (left) is estimated to reach between $2,000 - 4,000 (£1,250 - £2,499) at the auction later this week . The most eye-catching item amassed by the London-based asset management company is the pink satin gown she wore for her 1986 music video for Material Girl. The glittery gold cowboy hat from her 2000 video for 'Music' also made up the collection, as did a tuxedo jacket she wore in the 1985 comedy film Desperately Seeking Susan. Madonna starring in the film Evita wearing the iconic ivory ball gown which is now set to fetch $4,000 - 6,000 (£2,499 - £3,755) It is not known exactly how much money the group paid for the collection but it is estimated it could sell at auction for up to £400,000 this Friday, which would at least double their investment. One of the reasons why the outfits have shot up in value over the last decade is because Marquee Capital has shown them off around the world in their 'Simply Madonna - Materials of the Girl' exhibition. The display has helped raise the profile and interest in the items. Marquee Capital was launched in 2005 looking for investors to raise a six-figure kitty to snap up celebrity memorabilia. The group targeted Madonna material because the collectors' market for merchandise relating to the Beatles, Elivis Presley and Marylin Monroe was already well-established. The deep pink satin gown worn by Madonna in the 1984 music video Material Girl is estimated to sell for $60,000 (£37,541) while the white fox fur stole worn with it is estimated to go for $6,000 (£3,755) The group targeted Madonna material because the collectors' market for merchandise for the singer was less established than other stars - and it has proved to be a wise investment . Chetan Trivedi, 42, the chief executive of Marquee Capital, said: 'We set up Marquee Capital in 2005 because nobody in the market had set up a fund to invest in entertainment collectibles unlike art funds and vintage car funds. 'We built up a network of investors who had to earn over £100,000 a year or who had £250,000 worth of assets not including a house. 'We then had to decide who were were going to invest in. Marilyn and the Beatles are a bit played out so we decided on Madonna as she transcends two generations and her stuff if quite rare on the open market. Even just these song lyrics written by Madonna for an unknown song and scribbled on a piece of note paper is expected to reach $800-1,200 (£500 - £750) as die hard fans clamor to own any piece of the songstress . Other items up for grabs are the Rockford Peaches uniform worn by Madonna, in A League of Their Own in 1992 (Est, $3,000 - 5,000 or £1,877 -£3,128) and, right, the American Music Award for Favourite Single (Est, $4,000-6,000 or £2,502- £3,753) 'In Evita, Madonna set a record for the number of costume changes, which was 88. 'We went to the costume house that supplied the dresses and bought 35 of them. We were cash rich and made them an offer they couldn't refuse.' The fund sourced and bought dozens of other outfits, shoes and items of jewellery used by Madonna during her career spanning 20 years. Mr Trivedi said: 'It was a 10 year investment but we didn't just want the collection to sit there and hope it would increase in value which is why she showed it off around the world. 'We have three years left to run but we feel that now is a prime opportunity to offload it as the market has picked up.' The pink Material Girl gown is likely to sell at auction for about £37,000 while a blue taffeta dress Madonna wore while performing 'True Blue' on stage during her 1987 tour is tipped to sell for £40,000. Darren Julien, of LA-based Julien's Auctions, said: 'Madonna is one of the most collectible living celebrities. 'We hope to break $100,000 with the pink dress that she wore in the video 'Material Girl'. 'Marquee Capital was very smart in investing in Madonna and we are going to show them a sound return for their investment. Madonna is not only a global pop icons but a blue chip when it comes to investing.' The sale takes place on November 7.","Over 140 pieces of Madonna memorabilia going up for auction .

"Head lowered against a black background, and with a frown creasing his brow, this portrait of Winston Churchill captures the great man at his lowest ebb. It is a far cry from the iconic images of Britain's charismatic wartime leader in his trademark bowler hat, holding his fingers in a 'V' for Victory sign, or puffing on a fat cigar. But William Orpen's haunting portrait is the one Churchill himself treasured most, with the then 41-year-old describing it as 'the picture of a man's soul'. 'Haunted soul': The artist William Orpen captured Churchill in his political 'wilderness years' in the wake of the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign . Churchill sat for artist William Orpen in 1916 – as Britain was counting the human cost of the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign the then First Lord of the Admiralty had championed the year before. Irish artist William Orpen was an official war painter of the First World War, producing renditions of privates, dead soldiers and German Prisoners of War as well as official portraits of generals and statesmen. Churchill sat for Orpen on 11 occasions in 1916, an experience the artist is said to have found tense and difficult given the state of mind of his subject. Nonetheless, the final work met with the approval of Churchill, who upon seeing the painting is said to have told Orpen: 'It is not the picture of a man. It is the picture of a man's soul.' The suffering Orpen witnessed during his time as a war painter is said to have affected him deeply, and critics have attributed an occasional 'shallowness' in his portraits to emotional exhaustion in the wake of the Great War. The artist was made a Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1918 King's birthday honours list. He died in London aged 53. Having crashed out of Government, he likely suspected his hitherto glittering political career would never recover. That the catastrophe weighed heavy on Churchill's shoulders is evident from the gloom that permeates the portrait, and the artist described his subject as a 'man of misery'. But Churchill - who would go on to earn his place in history as arguably the greatest British prime minister - said Orpen's painting captured a glimpse into his very soul. Upon seeing the piece, Churchill is said to have told the artist: 'It is not the picture of a man. It is the picture of a man's soul.' The rarely seen life-size painting - which hung for years in the home of Churchill's late grandson - is now on display to the public in the National Portrait Gallery. The London gallery unveiled its new addition this week after securing the painting on a 10-year loan from Churchill's estate. Aside from a brief period on display at the Imperial War Museum in 2005, the 'deeply personal' portrait has remained within the Churchill family. The National Portrait Gallery said the painting captures a 'moment of crisis' in Churchill's career. Sandy Nairne, director of the gallery, said: ‘I am very pleased that the Churchill . family has agreed that this outstanding portrait by William Orpen of . Winston Churchill, the nation's greatest 20th century statesman, should . now be on public display.’ The portrait is . displayed prominently in the early 20th-century room, . illustrating Churchill’s significance in the context of the First World . War, the gallery said. V for Victory: Iconic images of the indomitable 'British bulldog' are far removed from the more vulnerable side of Churchill captured in Orpen's portrait . Up to the dark hour captured in Orpen's portrait, Churchill's path to success had been relatively smooth. Born . into the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough, as a young . man he joined the British Army and proved his talent as a writer - . attracting acclaim as a war correspondent. He . made his first foray into politics as Oldham MP in 1900, rising swiftly . to hold several senior positions before being appointed First Lord of . the Admiralty under Asquith's government in 1908. It . was in this position that, after war broke out in 1914, Churchill . pushed for the Gallipoli Campaign that would end in disaster and the . loss of thousands of troops. In November Churchill put forward his plans for a naval attack on Dardanelles in Turkey, a move based at least in part on what would turn out to erroneous reports regarding Ottoman troop strength. The attack - designed to open up a path for the British Army to invade the Gallipoli peninsula and go on to take the Ottoman capital Constantinople - was opposed by military chiefs, but Churchill argued successfully for the plan to go ahead. Losses: British, Austrialian and Indian troops in the Gallipoli landing at Cape Helles on April 25 1915 . A joint British and French campaign was duly mounted to secure Constantinople - now Istanbul - and secure a sea route to Russia. There was a delay of more than six weeks before many of the troops arrived from Britain, allowing Ottoman forces time to prepare defences for a land assault, and the landing date of April 25 was leaked in advance. Allied troops sustained devastating losses during the landings as the Ottomans furiously defended every inch of their soil. The attack then lost momentum after the initial landing with most troops remaining on, or not far from, the beaches, thus allowing the Ottomans time to bring in reinforcements. The campaign rolled on but Allied troops to achieve their initial objective proved unsuccessful and casualties mounted. In the wake of the failed August Offensive the campaign - increasingly unpopular with the British public - entered a hiatus period and Allied soldiers were eventually evacuated. By the close of the campaign in January 1916 more than 200,000 Allied troops had been killed. At the time of Orpen's portrait Churchill was preparing to defend himself against charges of reckless and incompetent leadership before the Dardanelles Commission. The Commission went on to conclude that he was not personally responsible for the failure of the mission, and Churchill eventually returned to the political front line at the outbreak of the Second World War, going on to be widely regarded as one of the great wartime leaders of the century.","William Orpen's portrait of Winston Churchill at a 'moment of crisis' has gone on display at the National Portrait Gallery .

"Kumar Sangakkara is entering the beginning of the end of his international career. Having recently retired from the shortest form, he plans to wind down in the other two and then, a little surprisingly, finish up with a couple of seasons in county cricket. When mapping out his future beyond  Sri Lanka’s two Tests this month, Sangakkara, 36, talks with boyish enthusiasm for the English domestic game. So far he has had just a couple of bite-sized chunks, seven seasons apart. But he sells the chill of Durham’s Chester-le-Street, his temporary home for a fortnight last month, like it’s the sunshine of the Seychelles. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Pietersen play an impromptu game with locals in Dubai . Phew! Kumar Sangakkara admits relief that Kevin Pietersen will not be facing Sri Lanka in the Test series . Out! Kevin Pietersen was omitted following question marks over his attitude during the Ashes defeat . Put simply, to recruit Sangakkara is to recruit a great of the game. His Test average going into the first Test against England at Lord’s on Thursday is a jaw-dropping 58.07. Not since Graeme Pollock (60.97) was stymied in his prime by South Africa’s sporting isolation 44 years ago has a player ended with such a high return. In addition to his Test acumen, he is one of only four players to have scored more than 12,000 runs in one-day internationals. Not bad for a guy who keeps wicket. ‘My end in one-day cricket will be the 2015 World Cup, if I get there fit and in form,’ he says. ‘Then we’ll sit down and see whether I am needed for Test cricket. ‘Who knows whether a county will have me for a season or two? I would like to wind down slowly as it can be a bit of a shock to the system if you stop completely. A couple of seasons (in England) would be fantastic. I really enjoyed my time in 2007 with Warwickshire, and  Durham have been great. I like the feel of county dressing rooms. There is a huge amount of ability in them and a huge amount of hunger. ‘Durham have been exceptional in that sense. For a side that’s won the County Championship three times in six years, they seem to have a fantastic attitude, both towards each other and wanting to achieve more. I always say that learning is a two-way street, but once I’ve finished my international career it will be about trying to do a proper job for the county I’m in. Big hitter: Kumar Sangakkara has a Test average of 58.07 and has hit more than 12,000 runs in ODIs . ‘Cricket brings out who you are as a person. It requires mental strength but also strength of character. But it’s only a game. There’s a lot more to life that you can experience and it will enhance what you do out there in the middle. I have been pretty lucky that way, so anything I can do to share my experiences would be welcome.’ Sangakkara is clear on what has been his driving force. ‘It’s about ensuring that I’m the best I can be. Your aim is to reach a standard of excellence you are happy with and leave the game a bit better for you having played it. ‘All the time you are striving to meet your goals — trying to get as many Test hundreds as you can, trying to get into the 10,000-run club (which he achieved in the 2012 Boxing Day Test at Melbourne). These are things that I did not think  possible at one time in my career. As I got accustomed to international cricket those became goals I set for myself.’ Spray it again: Sri Lanka players celebrate their 3-2 victory over England in their recent one-day tour . Great loss: Kumar Sangakkara was 'bitterly disappointed at losing coach Paul Fabrace (R) to England . Sangakkara thinks highly of Paul  Farbrace, the Englishman who spent four months as Sri Lanka head coach up to the World Twenty20 win in April before he was headhunted by the ECB to become the new assistant to Peter Moores. ‘From Paul’s time in 2007, as assistant to Trevor Bayliss, he proved to be a fantastic human being and a really great, rounded coach,’ affirms Sangakkara. ‘Caring about players, and being able to express that, elicits a far better response than chunks of strategy and analysis. His tenure was fantastic. One loss in 18 games and a World Cup win! ‘It was bitterly disappointing for the side to lose him. We would have liked it to  continue for a lot longer.’ Quite a catch: Wicket keeper revealed he would like to end his career playing county cricket in England . Sangakkara’s recent stint with Durham was an exercise in tightening technique. Combating the moving ball in England will be paramount to Sri Lanka’s chances on what is traditionally one of the toughest tours for Asian cricketers.  Having struggled against Yorkshire on his debut, Sangakkara responded by taking 159 off Sussex’s attack, his highest score in England to date. ‘Playing in England is a challenge but not insurmountable,’ says Sangakkara. ‘The key is for guys like me to get the runs on the board to put pressure on the opposition. One thing you accept with experience is that getting out in the first couple of overs is all right. Getting to 20 or 30 and making a silly mistake is not.’ England are clearly in transition: only a handful of players remain from the Test side that shared the short series in Sri Lanka two years ago. Most notably, Kevin Pietersen (ostracised) and Graeme Swann (retired) have gone. Sangakkara, though, is mystified that any international team would seek change in a bid for uniformity. It takes all sorts: Accomodating different individuals like Lasith Malinga is crucial, says Kumar Sangakkara . ‘Accommodating difference and valuing individuality are the most important things in a dressing room,’ he says. ‘For us, it’s been like that with Lasith (Malinga). He is very different in the way he looks and as a person. There are certain people you might not have dinner with, but that doesn’t take away from the fact they will be valuable players in a national cause, going out trying to win matches. ‘I don’t know the reasons for KP’s  exclusion but he’s an amazing player. I’ve watched him, admired him and he is undoubtedly an out-and-out match-winner. ‘Of course, as an opposition player I’m not disappointed he’s not around. We know what damage he could have done to us. To not have him walk in — that  presence he has — is a bit of a relief.’ Wisden Extra is the free online magazine from Wisden.

"Love taking selfies, shedding pounds on the 5:2 diet and finding love on Tinder? Sorry, you're officially uncool. Socks and sandals, pheromone dating parties, 'Voga' and hybrid food were today hailed as the coolest new trends of 2014, while Selfies, hot yoga, the 5:2 diet and app dating are going down in the style stakes. A new 'cool report' found Brits are increasingly looking to street styles and sub cultures to dictate their own trends rather than follow the opinion formers of the past. Sorry Kim, you're officially uncool! A new 'cool report' has asked Brits to vote for what's hot for 2014 - and selfies are out . The research revealed that 68 per cent of those polled voted Selfies, a celebrity social media staple, as well as smartphone dating craze, Tinder, as 'not cool'. Instead, life drawing classes and pheromone parties, the latest dating craze where people pick out a partner based on their natural smell, are considered cool by over three quarters of twenty something Brits. When it comes to fashion, 73 per cent of those polled think Birkenstocks, and the socks paired with sandals trend are two of the coolest looks. In Vogue: Birkenstocks, a footwear favourite of the early 2000's, are back with a bang, while new fusion food trends like ramen burgers (right) are perceived as cool . While dungarees and bum bags have recently been hailed 'must-haves' for pulling off the oh-so-now 90s throwback trend, the report classed them as items to leave at the back of the wardrobe in 2014 with over 87 per cent of people voting these as 'not cool'. The research also found that the kale phenomenon is well and truly over in the eyes of the public, as is the restrictive 5:2 diet. In its place is a celebration of food with hybrid concoctions such as ramen burgers, and baking both hailed as cool by over 70 per cent of those in their twenties. And it's not just food we're looking to have fun with, when it come to fitness, the gruelling 'hot yoga' trend - loved by celebs such as Gwyneth Paltrow - scored low on the cool barometer and has been replaced with 'Voga', which has been deemed cool by 86 per cent of those asked. Get a whiff of this! Sniffers get stuck into T-shirts as they search for a compatible match at the first-ever pheromone party in London . Popular: On average, users open the Tinder app seven times a day - with almost a billion matches since it launched 18 months ago - but sorry hopeful romatics, it's no longer cool . The brand new subculture of fitness is a cross between yoga and voguing - the 1980s New York drag scene dance craze - and encourages people to inject enjoyment into their fitness regime. A spokesperson for Vapestick, who conducted the research, said: 'What's really interesting is that historically trends have been established by celebrities, high fashion and opinion formers and then trickled down into the mainstream. 'However today it seems street style and subcultures are dictating the trends, which are now filtering up. 'The Vapestick Cool Report has proved that the power lies with everyday people and today's twenty-somethings aren't waiting around to be told what's cool and what's not, they're establishing that for themselves.'

"Man-made global warming is worsening and will disrupt both the natural world and human society, according to a joint report of two of the world's leading scientific organisations. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society, which is the national scientific academy of the UK, have released an unusual plain language report on climate change that addressed 20 issues. ‘People do have persistent questions all about climate change,’ said study author Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California. ‘This is a one-stop shop for many of those questions.’ If emissions continue . on their present trajectory, without . either technological or regulatory . abatement, then the best estimate . is that global average temperature . will warm a further 2.6 to 4.8 °C . (4.7 to 8.6 °F) by the end of the . century (right). The figure on left . shows projected warming with very . aggressive emissions reductions . The Climate Change: Evidence and Causes report, released today, addresses new issues such as the recent slowing in the increase of world temperatures and how heat-trapping gases are connected to extreme weather. It maintains there is unequivocal evidence that soaring levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are mainly the result of burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is now at its highest level for at least 800,000 years, and records dating back to the mid-19th century show a clear long-term warming trend. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth¿s surface and lower atmosphere warm . Human activities have increased CO2 concentrations by about 40 per cent, with more than half the increase occurring since 1970. Since 1900, the global average surface temperature has risen by 0.8 °C (1.4 °F). This has been accompanied by warming of the ocean, a rise in sea level, a strong decline in Arctic sea ice. Much of this warming has occurred in the last four decades as a result of greenhouse gases. Continued emissions of these gases will cause further climate change, including substantial increases in global average surface temperature and important changes in regional climate. Long-term climate change over many decadeswill depend mainly on the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted as aresult of human activities. One of the main clues to the origin of the CO2 is its atomic fingerprint, say the scientists. Measurements of different isotopes - or atomic ‘strains’ - of carbon show that most of the increase is human-generated. On the other hand, there is much less certainty about the extent to which sea levels are likely to rise, and what effect increasing acidity of the oceans will have on marine life. Increases in extreme weather, melting glaciers, rising seas and oceans getting more acidic are already happening, the 36-page report said. As well as this, the report claims the chemical balance of the oceans has shifted toward a more acidic state, which makes it difficult for organisms such as corals and shellfish to form and maintain their shells. As the oceans continue to absorb CO2, scientists believe their acidity will continue to increase over the next century, along with as yet undetermined impacts on marine ecosystems and the food chain. Earth's global average surface temperature has risen as shown in this plot of combined land and ocean measurements from 1850 to 2012, derived from three independent analyses of the available data sets . There is no scientific proof of man-made global warming and a hotter earth would be ‘beneficial for humans and the majority of other species’. The assertion was made by Canadian ecologist Patrick Moore, a member of Greenpeace from 1971 to 1986, to U.S lawmakers on Tuesday. He told The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: ‘If there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see.’ Moore pointed out that there was an Ice Age 45 0million years ago when CO2 was 10 times higher. He said: ‘There is some correlation, but little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global temperature through the millennia. 'The fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when CO2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main cause of global warming.’ Even if the earth does warm up, Moore claims that it will be to the advantage of humans and other forms of life, as ‘humans are a tropical species’. He said: ‘It is extremely likely that a warmer temperature than today’s would be far better than a cooler one.’ Humans, he added, just aren’t capable of predicting global temperature changes. These changes ‘are expected to . increase greater warming and will threaten food production, freshwater . supplies, coastal infrastructure and especially the welfare of the huge . population currently living in low-lying areas,’ it added. The . report said that while the rate of warming is slower in the 2000s than . it was in the 1990s, it doesn't negate the 150 years of observations . that show the world is warming. It also said that more the 90 per cent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases lately has been absorbed into the oceans' deep water, which for a while slows surface warming but not the long-term trend. Even if greenhouse gas emissions were to suddenly stop, it would take thousands of years for atmospheric CO2 to return to its levels before the industrial era. A similar conclusion was last year reached by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), who said global warming is unequivocal and human influence has been the dominant cause. The report highlighted a number of doomsday scenarios, including extreme storms, heat waves, rising sea levels and the melting of Greenland. Among its findings, it said that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 26-82cm by the end of the century. However, it was unable to explain why world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years, despite growing amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. This slowdown has been seized upon by climate sceptics who claim carbon dioxide is not as damaging as has been suggested.

"Newcastle travel to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, but mention of the Capital One Cup third-round tie was completely overlooked in Saturday’s matchday programme. The club blame a printing error but the slip-up is symptomatic of the Newcastle’s recent approach to cup competitions. Last season they made public their preference to remain in the Barclays Premier League rather than attempt to win a cup. Pressure is mounting on Alan Pardew but the home fans were mostly supportive of their team last week . The Newcastle boss has been critiised after a poor run of form stretching back into last season . They have not gone past the fourth round of the FA Cup or League Cup in seven years. This has upset fans who last saw Newcastle lift a trophy in 1969 in the shape of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup — precursor to the UEFA Cup. Mark Jensen, editor of The Mag fanzine, told Sportsmail: ‘To hear last year that the cups weren’t a priority was demoralising. ‘That was the start of the unrest which led to the walkout at the end of the season. If you can’t look forward to the cup games then it’s a sad day. Fraizer Campbell celebrates the goal that helped put Newcastle out of last year's FA Cup and start the unrest . Papiss Cisse has been struck down by illness and will miss the game against Crystal Palace . ‘It would be great to hear them come out and say we’re really going for it, but at the moment there’s nothing. Fans will be unhappy if we don’t get through or play a weakened team.’ Alan Pardew’s position as manager is safe despite United sitting bottom of the table after five games. Supporters, who had been expected to protest, instead got behind the team as they fought back for a point against Hull on Saturday. Tim Krul will not face Crystal Palace in the Captial One Cup due to illness . But victory against Palace is crucial, given the fallout from the FA Cup third-round defeat by Cardiff in January when Pardew fielded a weakened side. Illness, however, has already robbed Pardew of Papiss Cisse, who scored twice against Hull, goalkeeper Tim Krul and forward Yoan Gouffran. Siem de Jong (thigh) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) are also missing. Yoan Gouffran has also been hit by the illness and will not face Palace .","Newcastle haven't reached fifth round of domestic cup in seven years .

"Mirka Federer perched on a bench next to Court No 4 a fortnight ago and took the chance to add to the family album. Using her phone she snapped away, smiling and waiting for the right shots. Neither of her two sets of twins were around, nor were many others. Just the greatest player in the history of tennis and Stanislas Wawrinka, his Swiss compatriot and hitting partner that day. So she clicked away. Roger Federer, worth 17 Grand Slam titles and an estimated £140million, likes such keepsakes. These next couple of years are the final throes for a man one month short of his 33rd birthday, who recently told his Swiss biographer of his wish ‘to be 25 again so I had another 10 years of tennis’. On form: Federer fist pumps after winning his quarter-final match on Centre Court . Holding things together: Federer's wife, Mirka, looks after their young children . He had a smile on his face as he said it, just as he did when he joked to the same author that he might one day return to Wimbledon as a fan, camping in a tent and waiting in the queue for tickets. The smiles, according to those who know him, are the answers to questions of what has motivated him to continue during his two-year Grand Slam drought, with a legacy supposedly at stake and his ranking slipping. He fell to eighth, his second-round loss here last year perhaps the biggest indignity. Why hang on as a shadow of your former self? On Thursday, he was back at Court No 4, a Wimbledon semi-finalist having a hit before stepping in front of Milos Raonic on Friday afternoon. The practice session was tame; the crowd enormous. When it was over, five security guards formed a protective cordon around the ageing tennis player with the dodgy back. Occasionally, he stopped his escort for a high five with the fans, a great of sport having the time of his second life. Practice makes perfect: Fans flocked to get a glimpse of Federer on court four on Thursday . Dominant: Federer is back to his best after a nightmare 2013 . How he has fought his way back into prominence — and the top four — after the nightmares of 2013, is a tale of nannies, coaches and physiotherapy; it’s a comeback supported further by private planes, Mirka’s diary and, simply, a love for the game. Tim Henman is one of his closer friends in tennis and has watched as Federer recovered from his 2013 season, in which serious back injuries limited him to a single title — his worst return since 2001. ‘It is amazing to me,’ Henman said. ‘I was a similar age when I stopped. For the first time ever it was my job not my hobby. 'For me, when I look at him I see how much he enjoys it. I honestly think it is about his personal enjoyment of tennis. The challenge was last year. That is when you, or he, would really question it. But he has the hunger. Support: Tim Henman (left) has backed Federer to win Wimbledon . ‘I was speaking recently to Josh Eagle (Australia’s Davis Cup coach) and he was telling me Nick Kyrgios went to practise with Federer for a week in Switzerland. Apparently his work rate was incredible, the intensity of it. That is a guy who has nothing to prove. Those are the standards he sets.’ They are standards maintained in the organisation of his private life, driven by a wife who is said to apply extreme precision to the running of his domestic affairs. When Federer travelled to the French Open three weeks after the birth of his second set of twins, it is understood all four children joined him in Paris. A private plane and airstrip are understood to have been used, with five nannies part of the entourage. It is believed to be a regular arrangement. ‘Mirka keeps the whole thing together and oversees the organising of their life,’ said Rene Stauffer, his biographer. Mental toughness: Federer has hired Stefan Edberg as his coach . ‘Roger loves everything in tennis. He says when he stops playing he’ll come back here one day and wants to be a supporter. He joked he wants to sleep in a tent and queue. But Mirka is the person in the background who I think keeps it going smoothly for him now.’ On the court, Federer is now using a bigger racket for a greater margin of error and has hired Stefan Edberg as a coach to freshen his mental approach. His schedule was also reworked. It is understood Federer is worth £600,000 a time on the exhibition circuit, which is how he spent his off-season in December 2012. Last winter, he went to Dubai to train. ‘I believe I worked the hardest from the top eight in the off-season,’ Federer told Sportsmail earlier this year. Next up: Milos Raonic stands between Federer and a place in the final . But can he win another Grand Slam? It is a tough ask for a father of four, as John McEnroe illustrated this week. ‘I found it extremely difficult to juggle the responsibilities and joys of children,’ McEnroe said. ‘With  trying to be a good father and trying to stave off that  inevitable decline, I didn’t do nearly as good a job as Federer does.’ Indeed, since 1990 only eight Slams have been won by fathers. Twice it was Federer. With two more children it is tougher again. But when has Federer ever been like the rest?","Swiss star had a nightmare 2013 but is back on top form in SW19 .

"One of the young Libyan rebels credited with capturing Moammar Gaddafi in a drainage ditch nearly a year ago has died of his injuries after being kidnapped, beaten and slashed by the late dictator's supporters. The death of Omran Shaaban, who had been hospitalised in France, raised the prospect of even more violence and score-settling in the north African country. The newly elected National Congress have already authorised police and the army to use force if necessary to apprehend those who abducted the 22-year-old and three companions in July near the town of Bani Walid. Scroll down for video . The coffin of Omran Ben Shabaan is carried as thousands of Misrata residents pay their respects during his funeral at Misrata stadium . Libya is battling lingering pockets of support for the old regime, and its government has been unable to rein in armed militias in a country rife with weapons. Earlier this month, a demonstration at the U.S. Consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi turned violent, killing four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. Shaaban was praised as a 'dutiful martyr' by the National Congress, although his family says he never received a promised reward of 1million Libyan dinars ($800,000) for capturing Gaddafi on October 20, 2011, in the former leader's hometown of Sirte. The eccentric dictator was killed later that day by revolutionary fighters. The Libyan government said it would honour Shaaban with a funeral befitting a hero. His body was greeted at the airport in his hometown of Misrata by more than 10,000 people for a procession to a soccer stadium for funeral prayers. Photos on social media websites showed a wooden coffin with a glass window that revealed Shaaban's face, with white gauze covering his head. In the capital of Tripoli, several hundred protesters gathered outside the headquarters of the National Congress to demand that the government avenge Shaaban's death. Less than a year after helping drag Moammar Gaddafi from a drainage ditch, a 22-year-old former rebel Omran Shaaban has died. He is pictured here, receiving treatment from a doctor at a hospital in France . National hero: Thousands of Misrata residents gathered to pay their respects before the coffin of Omran Ben Shabaan . Shabaan, 22, was one of the rebels credited with capturing the late Libyan Muammar Gaddafi . Shaaban's family said that he and three friends had been en route home to the western city of Misrata from a vacation in July when they were attacked by gunmen in an area called el-Shimekh near Bani Walid. Shaaban and his friends, who like many Libyans were armed, fired back, the family said. Two bullets hit Shaaban, and he was paralysed from the waist down, his relatives said. The men were captured by militiamen from Bani Walid, a town of about 100,000 people that remains a stronghold of Gaddafi loyalists and is isolated from the rest of Libya. Revolutionary Libyan fighters inspect a storm drain where Muammar Gaddafi was found wounded in Sirte, Libya, last year . Gaddafi was killed on October 20 in a final assault on his hometown Sirte by fighters of the new regime, who said they had cornered the ousted despot in a sewage pipe waving a golden gun. The moment was captured on video . Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, covered in blood, is pulled from a truck by NTC fighters in Sirte before he was killed . President Mohammed el-Megarif visited Bani Walid this month and secured the release of Shaaban and two of his companions. A fourth is still being held. When Shaaban was finally brought home, he was 'skin and bones' - still paralysed, frail and slipping in and out of consciousness, according to his brother, Abdullah Shaaban. 'It was clear he was beaten a lot,' Abdullah Shaaban said. 'His entire chest was sliced with razors. His face had changed. It wasn't my brother that I knew.' Omran Shaaban was later flown to France for medical treatment. There are still pockets of support for former leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya, despite his death . Shaaban, the second youngest in a . family of nine children, was a member of Libya Shield, a loose coalition . of the country's largest militias relied on by the Defense Ministry. Khalifa al-Zawawi, the former head of Misrata's local council, said the government reneged on paying the reward to Shaaban. Abdullah Shaaban said his brother did not mind, saying he considered capturing Gaddafi to be his national duty. Libya's president released a statement on Tuesday vowing that those responsible for the violence against Omran Shaaban would be punished. But apprehending and disarming the militants in Bani Walid are among the most daunting tasks facing the government. The town is heavily armed with rocket-propelled grenades, automatic weapons and artillery left over from last year's civil war. Residents of Bani Walid say that pictures of Gaddafi are displayed during weddings and youths play his speeches on their cars' stereos. Students refrain from singing Libya's new national anthem and teachers refuse to follow the revised curriculum. Bani Walid fighters were blamed for many of the sniper attacks, shelling, rapes and other violence against the city of Misrata during the civil war, and there were new calls on Tuesday from residents of Misrata for vengeance against Bani Walid. Shaaban's eldest brother, Walid, insists there will be justice for the family, regardless of whether the government is the one to administer it. 'I plan to pursue his rights legally and join if there is a military incursion. We are going to death, God willing,' Walid Shaaban said. Family friend Abu-Shaala echoed that sentiment. 'If the government does not go in, we are going in,' he said. 'We are all patient. But our patience has limits.'","Omran Shaaban, 22, was one of the fighters who pulled former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi out of a ditch in his stronghold of Sirte .

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers felt his side had shown great resilience to emerge triumphant from a crazy Capital One Cup tie against Middlesbrough. The third-round encounter at Anfield saw the teams level at 1-1 after 90 minutes and 2-2 after extra-time, with the Sky Bet Championship visitors, who hit the post near the end of normal time, netting their second equaliser in the dying seconds. An epic penalty shoot-out followed - believed to be the longest in the competition's history - which the hosts eventually won 14-13. Liverpool beat Middlesbrough 14-13 on penalties after drawing 2-2 in their Capital One Cup third round tie . And Rodgers said afterwards: 'It was a real good night for us. 'I was obviously pleased to get through, and that experience, even though it was a long night for everyone, was great for our young players. 'It is good to win no matter how you do it. We played okay in the game and didn't create a great deal to be honest, but we showed good perseverance to keep going. 'As it is at the moment, we made too many mistakes and got punished for that in the game. 'But the players showed great resilience and mentality to keep going and at the end, when it was needed, they showed wonderful composure - some of our young players stepping up to take the penalties.' Brendan Rodgers praised his side's perseverance and resilience, despite the holes in his defence . In a Liverpool side showing seven changes from Saturday's 3-1 Barclays Premier League loss at West Ham, 17-year-old local lad Jordan Rossiter made a swift impact on his senior debut, the midfielder coolly slotting in the opening goal of the game in the 10th minute. There were also notable contributions from 20-year-old forward Suso, scorer of the Reds' second, and fellow substitute Jordan Williams, a 18-year-old midfielder and another debutant, who converted in the shootout. Rodgers said: 'Tonight was a good night for our young players. Mario Balotelli took two penalties in the shootout, going left both times and scored each . 'Young Jordan Rossiter at 17 years of age - he could walk to Anfield, he lives just around the corner, and I was delighted for him. He got the opportunity and showed a wonderful finish, and composure to get that finish. 'I was also impressed with young Jordan Williams - he came on and showed real good stature and composure in the game. He is a wonderful footballer and a young player who is developing well. 'And young Suso hasn't had a lot of game time at all, but he has kept working and I thought he was really bright for us when he came on, and took his goal really well. 17-year-old  Jordan Rossiter scored the first goal of the evening after a defensive mix-up from the visitors . Asked what the future held for Rossiter and Williams, Rodgers said: 'Opportunity - and I think that is the biggest thing a young player can want. 'I think all the young players and coaches in the academy will look at that tonight, and they know anyway through my work that I will always look to them. 'My job is to grow the top-class young talents, not just buy them in. We want to grow them, or there is no point having our youth academy.

"On trial: Jason Smith was charged with strangling 35-year-old Dr Melissa Ketunuti, who was found bound and burned in her home . A Philadelphia pediatrician pleaded for her life as she was strangled by an exterminator working in her home this year, police have revealed. The confession by 37-year-old suspect Jason Smith was read by police on Wednesday in court. Police said that Smith cried and apologized as he admitted to choking Dr Melissa Ketunuti to death, tying her up and burning her corpse. A judge then ordered Smith held for trial on charges including murder and arson in the death of Dr Ketunuti, 35. Smith was dealing with a mouse infestation in the doctor's home at the time, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. According to Smith's statement, he attacked Dr Ketunuti in the basement of her downtown home on January 21 after she criticized his work. The statement says Smith strangled her, tied her and up and set a fire to destroy evidence. Surveillance video from nearby businesses helped lead to Smith's arrest a few days later at his Levittown home. Smith's lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment. Dr Ketunuti was a researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The brutal and grisly death of the young pediatrician stunned the neighborhood, Smith's family and even police - who are baffled as to why he would commit such a crime with no violent past. When he confessed to police, he allegedly told them Ketunuti belittled him, which made him so angry that he struck her. Murdered: Dr Melissa Ketunuti had been a pediatrician for five years before her gruesome murder in Philadelphia in January . CCTV: Melissa Ketunuti is seen just before 11am returning to her home after running some errands in the area on January 21 . Stalker: Less than one minute later, Smith follows in her footsteps, wearing a North Face jacket and hat . After: Less than an hour later, the camera showed Smith leaving the scene of the murder with his coat and hat removed . Victim: Dr Ketunuti, who worked at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was only 35 when she was tied up, strangled and set on fire . After . an intense investigation, police were able to zero in on Smith after a . local coffee shop owner and police officers pored over the CCTV footage . from the day of the murder and saw the young doctor walk by with Smith . following closely behind. An . hour later, he returns, this time with a clearer image of his face, . gets into his pickup truck and drives away before circling the doctor's . home twice. He then went on to another job in New Jersey. A police source said that Smith was working on behalf of a company called David Bilyk Exterminating. Developer Ori Feibush, who owns the OCF Coffee House, at 18th and South . streets, which is around the corner from Ketunuti's house, told Philly.com: 'We had crystal-clear video of him [Smith] walking right past the coffee . shop and looking at the cameras. 'I was exceptionally . uncomfortable until they caught the guy because it looked like anybody . who walks by the shop.' Leaving: Jason Smith's silver pickup truck is seen driving away before circling the area a few times. The truck was seized as crucial evidence . Remains: Police officers carry the charred body of Melissa Ketunuti from her home to a waiting police van . Mr Feibush added: 'When he came back he had gloves on, his hat was off and his jacket was . in his arms,' he said. 'Coming back he walks directly under the camera . and that's when we realized, ""Wow!"" We had this guy on camera.' He . said he went outside to get homicide detectives who were still . stationed to the area on Wednesday and told them what he found. 'They were in absolute shock as well,' he said. 'There was the guy, . walking in broad daylight with no hat on, not hiding his appearance in . front of a very powerful surveillance camera.' Dr Ketunuti, 35, lived alone with her dog in the quiet, residential area of . Philadelphia. Firefighters responded to the call around 12.30pm and . discovered the bound body in her basement. Authorities say she was fully clothed and there were no signs of sexual assault. The doctor worked at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and was an avid blogger. She was a second-year infectious diseases fellow and researcher at CHOP. Crime scene: Police officers close off the area around Dr Ketunuti's home . 'Melissa . was a warm, caring, earnest, bright young woman with her whole future . ahead of her,' said Paul Offit, MD, chief of the Division of Infectious . Diseases, in a written statement. 'But . more than that, she was admired, respected and loved by those with whom . she worked here at CHOP. Her death will have a profound impact on those . who worked with her and we will all miss her deeply.' Her blog revealed she was an avid . traveler - her mother is Belgian and her father Thai - and liked to go . hiking and running in her free time.

In the summer of 2005, she worked on an AIDS research fellowship in Botswana through the National Institutes of Health. She also completed internships at Johns Hopkins Hospital and New York University.

"When Sadie Budden spent two years struggling to conceive she thought she might never have children. But then, to everyone’s surprise, she gave birth to two – in the space of just six-and-a-half months.Against all the odds, Ronnie and his little sister Sienna were born only 208  days apart. Miss Budden, 31, a pre-school teacher, was stunned to get pregnant three weeks after Ronnie was born. But she and her partner Paul Dennis, 38, a builder, were even more surprised when she gave birth to Sienna at only 26 weeks of pregnancy. 17-month-old Ronnie and his little sister 11-month Sienna. It is the smallest age gap between siblings in the UK . Their remarkable babies – known as ‘tandem twins’ as they are born within the same nine to ten months – will now enter UK record books for the smallest age gap between two siblings who are not twins. Miss Budden said: ‘When I saw my GP to confirm Sienna’s pregnancy, I don’t know who was more shocked – him or me. No one could have guessed then that Sienna would be born prematurely leaving such a minute gap. It’s left everyone – doctors, midwives and health visitors – absolutely amazed.’ When Ronnie was born full-term weighing a healthy 6lb 11oz, in August 2011, the couple were in no rush to have another baby. ‘It took us two years to conceive him,’ said Miss Budden. ‘We were beginning to think it would never happen. So Ronnie’s birth seemed something of a miracle. We were just thrilled with him and hadn’t even considered when we might have another child.’ Sadie with Sienna and Ronnie, left; Dennis and Sadie (right) struggled to conceive before having the tandem twins . Even six weeks later when Miss Budden felt sick one morning, she put it down to a virus. But she decided to take a pregnancy test to be sure. ‘When it proved positive, I thought it was wrong so I did another. ‘Even then when I saw my GP I imagined he’d just say the positive test was due to hormones left in my body from Ronnie’s pregnancy.’ It was three weeks before Sadie could even hold severely premature Sienna . Once the couple got over the shock . they were delighted. ‘While it was tiring being pregnant and getting up . every night to see to baby Ronnie, we looked forward to a little . sibling.’ But baby number two came much sooner than expected. In February 2012, at 26 weeks, Miss Budden woke at 5am with contractions. Sienna was born two hours later. Although weighing 1lb 14oz – a reasonable weight for such a premature baby – she was taken to special care. ‘She was so poorly it was three weeks before I could even hold her,’ said Miss Budden. ‘She had difficulty breathing and eating. It was heartbreaking.’ Three days later Sienna had a brain haemorrhage, a common complication with premature birth, and it was touch and go whether she would pull through. But after three and a half months  she was well enough to come home to Andover, in Hampshire, on her original due date. Miss Budden, who also has a son, Jordan, 13, from a previous relationship, said: ‘We feel so lucky that despite being born so early, Sienna has pulled through. Since coming home she has gone from strength to strength.’ With a newborn and another baby who was beginning to crawl, life was hectic at first for the couple. ‘Those first few months were a blur of nappies and night feeds – and both of them needed to be carried around,’ said Miss Budden. ‘But now we’re beginning to see that being born so close together in age is going to be a real bonus. ‘Seeing them playing together is wonderful and already they seem to have developed a special bond.’","Sadie Budden, 31, had Sienna and Ronnie just six and a half months apart .

"Eight top English football clubs are being investigated after Rangers Football Club plunged into administration and lifted the lid on an alleged widespread tax dodge. Fans of the Scottish Premier League giants were furious after it was revealed that the Glasgow club owes up to £70million to the taxman. Now the nightmare is spreading to the rest of the sport's elite, as current and former Premier League sides are being investigated over deals thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Club chaos: Rangers owner Craig Whyte, left, and manager Ally McCoist, right, have been thrown into turmoil after the Scottish side's finances came under the spotlight . Critical questions: Rangers fan Michael Haggerty calls for answers from the Glasgow club's owner outside the Ibrox Stadium . Rangers owe around £9m to HM Revenue and Customs plus a potential . £70m bill to follow an inquiry into its use of . Employment Benefit Trusts, which are often seen as ways of avoiding tax. EBTs allowed foreign football stars to have their wages paid into a trust, so they could withdraw the money after they stopped living in Britain and therefore avoid the top 50 per cent rate of UK tax. One of the reasons Rangers fell into administration is the probe by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs into the use of Employee Benefit Trusts - a complex tax avoidance scheme. The Scottish giants are understood to have used EBTs for the decade leading up to Craig Whyte taking over the club last year. EBTs were until recently considered an efficient way of reducing tax – but companies with disputed EBT issues had to settle them by December 31 last year. Companies pay into a trust, which loans the money to the employee for benefits. Examples of these benefits are pensions or the purchase of shares. The money is never meant to be repaid. EBTs allowed foreign players to have their wages paid into a trust and withdraw the money when they were no longer living in Britain - therefore avoiding the top 50 per cent rate of UK tax. HMRC claim Rangers’ previous owners used EBTs to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax and National Insurance on the player payroll. The taxman has declared the practice illegal — and claims the club's previous owners used the trusts to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax and National Insurance on the player payroll. 'Rangers may be the tip of the iceberg,' football finance expert Dr Chris Brady told The Sun. 'EBTs became popular with clubs as a means of reducing crippling wage bills. 'We believe at least eight current or former Premier League clubs are being investigated.' Rangers boss Ally McCoist summed up the feelings of all the club's fans yesterday, saying: 'It has been a very disappointing and black day. 'We have 140 years of fantastic history, but the most important thing is that we look to the future and the next 140 years. 'Going into administration obviously wasn't ideal, but it's the opinion of many people that it might be the best thing.' Fans protested outside the Ibrox Stadium today, demanding answers from the club's owner Craig Whyte. Celtic . are now four points ahead of Rangers at the top of the Scottish Premier . League - but the Glasgow club now have more pressing issues. Paul Clark, of administrators Duff and Phelps, told Rangers TV: 'We will be conducting regular meetings with the staff and, wherever we can, will keep giving messages to the fans who we know have an interest in the work that we are doing. 'I can't give any firm commitment but certainly over the next day or two we hope to get control of the finances of the club and to better understand what we need to do in the coming days and weeks. 'The club had been in such a period of uncertainty that the administration will actually relieve that uncertainty and start to build the future.' Former Rangers player Trevor Steven has said he believes Whyte's presence at Ibrox will soon be untenable. Corrosion: Mournful Rangers supporters tie a scarf to a statue outside their stadium, as the nightmare begins to spread to Premier League clubs in England . Rangers supporters are asking serious questions of Whyte, who bought out Sir David Murray for £1 but pledged to settle Lloyds Banking Group's £18m debt and invest in the playing squad and stadium. Earlier this month, Whyte admitted he had accessed cash from loan company Ticketus after reports claimed he had borrowed £24m on future season ticket sales. The main issues over alleged unpaid tax date from before Whyte took over. But Steven still feels his relationship between the fans and Whyte, who flew out of Glasgow Airport last night, cannot be mended. 'I don't think there has ever been a good relationship between Craig Whyte and the support,' he said. 'For me, there has always been smoke and mirrors since he came in. He came with a handful of promises that have never been delivered. 'That's what really aggravates the Rangers support, they have never been able to trust the man in charge and there has been no transparency. 'The fact that he has gone off to Monaco is not particularly what the supporters want to hear.' Administrators Duff and Phelps have now moved to calm fans' fears that their club will cease to exist. They . have also confirmed that Saturday's Clydesdale Bank Premier League game . against Kilmarnock at Ibrox will go ahead as planned. A statement said: 'We can report we have made very good progress within the first 24 hours of being appointed administrators over Rangers Football Club. 'Our first priority has been to ensure that the football club continues to function and this is being achieved with the help of staff, players and management at the club. 'In particular, we would like to thank the club's business partners who are going the extra mile to ensure that Saturday’s home match against Kilmarnock goes ahead as scheduled. We had extremely constructive discussions with Strathclyde Police and we can confirm the match will take place. 'We fully recognise this is a difficult time for players and staff at the club and are extremely appreciative of their reaction to the situation. We will be holding meetings with the staff on a weekly basis at least to inform them of developments. 'We are also in the process of speaking to representatives of supporters' groups and that will be an ongoing process. 'In broad terms, supporters can be reassured that Rangers will continue as a football club and we hope to reach a stage as soon as possible where the club can emerge from administration. 'We have had expressions of support across the political spectrum in Scotland within the last 24 hours and there is clearly a desire to see Rangers come through this situation successfully. 'There had been widespread publicity and speculation regarding the financial affairs of the football club. 'For clarity, the cost structure of the club and ongoing losses were such that the club had outstanding liabilities to HMRC. 'These were the subject of discussion and clearly HMRC wished to see them resolved as a matter of urgency.  We are involved in dialogue with HMRC and will work with them constructively, as is the case with all other key stakeholders.'","Glasgow club could be charged for allowing foreign stars to put their wages in trusts and avoid top-rate tax .

"Things have only gotten messier at Dartmouth College in the weeks since a former fraternity brother went public with hazing allegations involving swimming in and swallowing vomit. Senior Andrew Lohse brought the issue to the forefront in January, when he wrote a column in the school newspaper describing 'dehumanizing' experiences he witnessed at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. During hazing and throughout the year, the fraternity pressured pledges to swim in a kiddie pool of rotten food, vomit and other bodily fluids; eat omelettes made of vomit and chug cups of vinegar, the fraternity member said. Allegations: Senior Andrew . Lohse, right, claims SAE fraternity brothers forced he and other members to swim in kiddie pools full of vomit. SAE's Dartmouth president Brendan Mahoney, left, said no such events occurred during the 2011 pledgings . Animal house: More than a quarter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon's brotherhood had been accused of hazing after a former pledge said he and others were forced to swim in a kiddie pool of vomit and other bodily fluids . He called those activities the norm . rather than the exception on the Ivy League campus, and he criticized . the administration for not doing enough when he made anonymous . complaints last year. The . week after the column was published, more than 100 faculty members wrote . to the administration, describing hazing as an 'open secret' and . calling on the administration to set up an independent commission to . address it. However, . the fraternity's president, Brendan Mahoney, said all 27 accused . students face identical charges relating to new member recruitment in . the fall of 2011 in an email to the Associated Press. But by that time, the fraternity had . gotten rid of any traditions that would be 'deemed problematic' by the . administration, Mahoney said, and no current members of SAE were members . in 2009 when Mr Lohse was a pledge. As . for Mr Lohse's graphic allegations, 'None of these practices, and . nothing remotely close to hazing, occurred at our pledge events in . 2011,' he said in an email to The Associated Press. Hazing . has been a problem with fraternities as long as they have existed. In . fraternities, it is often seen part of a ritual necessary to joining the . brotherhood. Throughout the decades, acts and laws have been imposed at . some universities to prevent such practices. Brotherhood: 27 members of the fraternity face identical charges, according to SAE's president (there is no suggestion that any of those pictured here face charges) Taking action: More than more than 100 faculty members wrote to the Dartmouth administration, describing hazing as an 'open secret' and calling on the administration to set up a task force to address it . The . college has since formed a task force and brought hazing charges . through its judicial affairs office against the fraternity and more than . a quarter of its members, including Mr Lohse. Dean of the College Charlotte Johnson declined to comment on those charges. Toga: John Belushi starred in the 1978 film Animal House and offered a comedic look into frat life . Hazing, considered a rite of passage by some fraternities, has been largely condemned and banned by colleges and universities with Greek life. However, what goes in the privacy of the fraternity’s houses is much different than their public image. Hazing incidents have emerged across the nation where recruits were forced to complete physically challenging, often humiliating tasks like consuming large amounts of alcohol in short time spans, getting paddled, being forced to eat animal parts, and being stripped naked. Lighter forms of hazing like drinking games are also banned by nearly every university's panhellenic associations. Mr . Lohse did not specify in his column whether all alleged abuses occurred . in 2009 or later, and he declined to comment Monday, citing an . agreement with another publication. Dartblog.com, . a blog written by former students about the college, obtained a copy of . the letter notifying Mr Lohse of the charges against him. According to . the letter, Mr Lohse is accused of threatening physical harm to new . fraternity members, putting other students in fear for their safety . and/or engaging in hazing during the fall 2011 term. He . also is accused providing alcohol to underage students, providing drugs . and/or providing alcohol to obviously intoxicated individuals during . the same time period. The . charges filed were identical for the other individuals, 'even though . Lohse's tale does not describe them as engaged in the same activities,' said Mr Mahoney, who said students have been charged 'without a shred of . real evidence.' Administrators, he suggested, are panicking in the face . of bad press. 'We do know that Dartmouth has come in for a lot of bad publicity because of Mr Lohse's allegations. We hope Dartmouth's administration will focus on the evidence rather than on a public relations strategy,' he said. Ms Johnson, the college administrator, strongly denied both Mr Lohse's allegation that the college failed to act on his initial complaints and Mahoney's suggestion that the recent charges were brought to quell criticism. She said the administration already had been working hard to tackle the issue of hazing and was not simply responding to the recent allegations and faculty pressure. For example, the college hired a new director of Greek organizations who had been credited with turning around the fraternity and sorority system at another college, has hired two sexual assault coordinators and is in the process of hiring another alcohol and drug abuse counsellor. The college sees hazing as part of a larger problem, tied together with binge drinking and sexual assault, and has taken steps to address all three through the National College Health Improvement Project it launched last year. Notorious: The secret world of fraternity societies has been used as the backdrop for many TV plots including this episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit . 'Clearly we put our resources where our mouth is,' she said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon provides all of its members with anti-hazing and risk management education and, several years ago, launched a comprehensive anti-hazing program called We Stand Together. Source: Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national website . 'This idea that we have somehow thrown up our hands, said there's nothing we can do about hazing or other high risk behaviour going on college campuses is a complete mischaracterization.' Ms Johnson also said college officials did everything they could when Mr Lohse made his anonymous complaints, but the tips he provided didn't pan out. There are credibility issues surrounding . Mr Lohse’s  include Mr Lohse's 2010 arrest and conviction for cocaine . possession and witness tampering and a 2011 disorderly conduct . conviction, following a confrontation with a security officer during . Homecoming Weekend festivities. 'The opinion of most students is that he has a bone to pick with both the college and SAE,' said Stephanie Pignatiello, a senior who said that while she believes hazing happens, she thinks Mr Lohse's claims are greatly exaggerated. But she also agrees with him that the college hasn't done much to solve the problem. 'They seem to be largely absent,' she said. 'I don't think much will change at the administrative level.' Sophomore Stuart Ghafoor said reading Mr Lohse's condensed description of hazing was 'gross,' but not a surprise. He thinks SAE is being scapegoated so the college can appear to be doing something to address hazing. 'But if the administration goes after it, it could make it even more underground, which would be more dangerous,' he said.","Former Dartmouth member said Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity pressured pledges to eat vomit omelettes and chug cups of vinegar .

"Neymar perhaps lucky to just get yellow. He looks for the opportunity but has an open hand so there is no power in the contact with Luka Modric. He’s not endangering his opponent and so a yellow card is a sensible decision by the referee. Croatia manager Niko Kovac blasted referee Yuichi Nishimura for his poor performance during the opening match of the 2014 World Cup. The Japanese official had a night to forget, allowing Neymar to stay on the pitch following a cynical elbow on Luka Modric in the first-half, before awarding the tournament hosts a soft penalty and disallowing what looked like a legitimate equaliser by Croatia.

"Flipping brilliant: Shelby Holmes will be swapping the fairground for Oxford this autumn after some excellent A-levels . A Gypsy who works in an amusement park is off to Oxford University after gaining outstanding A-level results, making her one of the first travellers to make it there. Shelby Holmes, 18, who is happy to call herself a gypsy is head girl at St Brigid’s School in Denbigh, north Wales, has been travelling the UK outside term time all her young life. But now she will have to put down new roots after her place to read English literature at Trinity College, Oxford, was confirmed. Miss Holmes, 18, achieved two A* in English Literature and religious studies and a B in history. Shelby is from Towyn and on top of her studying she has a part-time job in the family run amusement park, Pleasure Land. But she wasn't out celebrating last night when her results came out, as she had to be back at work calling out bingo numbers. 'It is great news, I had to get three As to get into Oxford but, because I got two A*s, thankfully I’ve still got in,' she said. 'These type of results are extremely unusual for travellers and to go to any university is very rare for us.' 'My family and my mum have been behind me all the way to go to university and during my exams,' she said. 'I won’t be out celebrating unfortunately, I’m working in the arcade calling the bingo numbers. 'I’ve been saving money for university and me and my family take fair equipment to the Chester fair and I help build the rides and mind the children all day.' Shelby travels all over the UK with her family and has set up a fair in St Giles in Oxford several times. Very proud: Student Shelby Holmes being congratulated by dad Michael and mum Kim . 'I’ll be moving to Oxford University in October and will still go travelling with my family in winter but not in term time,' she said. 'I am really excited to go to university, I’ve been to Oxford a few times now with the fair, I’ve become quite familiar with it.' One of Shelby’s proudest teachers is head of sixth form Stuart Ayres. 'We have had great results, but we are especially proud of Shelby as she is a traveller and works so hard,' he said. Sky high: Thanks to her great results she'll be studying English Literature at Oxford University, one of the first travellers to do so . 'We feel like we brought her up because she has been with us for so long and done so well, this is the kind of place you can do something like this. 'She is unlike anyone else, we usually send someone to Oxford or Cambridge every year and Shelby has done really well to get in.' A spokesman for the National Gypsy Council said Shelby’s academic success was great news. 'More and more gypsies and travellers are getting into education these days,” said spokesman Joseph Jones. 'That being said, gypsies and travellers are still the bottom of every grades table/graph. 'We have a number of gypsy traveller academics but there needs to be more.' Fun of the fair:  Shelby Holmes with big sister Navenka, who both work at the amusements and move around the country . Shelby’s place at Trinity College, Oxford, is a sign of changing times at one of the world’s greatest academic institutions. A University of Oxford spokesman said: 'Oxford works incredibly hard to ensure candidates from non-traditional and under-represented backgrounds are not put off applying here and undertook more than 1,500 outreach events last year alone. 'We are very pleased that for 2012 entry we have continued to attract students from schools and backgrounds that have little previous experience with Oxford. 'We will continue our programme of outreach and recruitment activities in Wales and hope more academically talented Welsh students will consider looking across the border to Oxford.'","Shelby Holmes is one of the first travellers to go to Oxford and will read English literature .

"Boxing at the Games stepped into a brave new world without headguards and, within minutes of the first bout, Mathew Martin, of Nauru, had a large lump on his head while Northern Ireland’s Michael Conlan had blood streaming down his face. The International Boxing Association stopped the use of headgear in male fights, citing medical experts who said it would help lower concussions. After celebrating Friday’s win in his bantamweight contest, Olympic bronze medallist Conlan, from Belfast, was in no mood to disagree with the decision, saying: ‘I loved fighting without the headguard but cuts are going to be dangerous when you turn professional so you’re better off learning now. Boxing is going to have to get used to it.’ War wounds: Mathew Martin (left) had a bump on his head while Michael Conlan's head poured with blood . Bout: Conlan of Northern Ireland (left) fights Martin from Nauru during their men's bantam weight (56kg) Fight: Boxing at the Commonwealth Games stepped into a brave new world without headguards . England super-heavyweight Joe Joyce, who beat Seychelles rival Keddy Agnes on a unanimous 3-0 decision, agreed, adding: ‘I like boxing without headguards. There is the risk of cuts but that’s boxing. It’s early days of boxing without them and we are all still learning.’ But that sentiment was far from unanimous. Kenya’s Benson Njangiru, who won his bantamweight fight, said going into the ring for the first time without headgear was ‘scary’. ‘You have to be more worried about cuts,’ said Njangiru, who won a silver medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi. ‘But the change affects both fighters the same way.’ While female fighters and younger boxers will still use headgear, the boxing association cited medical studies that wearing headgear diffused blows to the head and allowed boxers to sustain more head shots (and potential brain damage) for longer periods of time. Harry Hawkins of Northern Ireland, who coaches the Mozambique team, said: ‘I am not in favour of it, there were two guys cut in the first fight. These guys will be getting hit far too often. It is OK in a one-off competition, but these fighters will have five bouts in 10 days.’ Hawkins hopes headguards are restored before the 2016 Olympic Games. Hopeful: Harry Hawkins, who coaches the Mozambique team, wants headguards to come back by 2016 . England boxing team chief John Hallam said: ‘The boxers are now here to box, to keep their head out of the stance. We believe that, with the headguards on, you tended to lean in, to take the punch. We all feel that won’t be a problem now.’ And blood in the ring? ‘Unfortunately it happens, doesn’t it?’ Hallam said. Paul Johnston, coach of the Northern Ireland team, said he’s confident that the research used by the association to cite fewer concussions is sound. He also points to a positive side benefit — a more spectator-friendly sport that allows  boxer’s faces and reactions to be seen by the fans. ‘It will enhance the spectator experience, and anything that increases the participation of the sport can only be a good thing,’ Johnston said.

"A high school student who posted a message to Twitter saying that there was an intruder in her house before disappearing allegedly made the claim as part of an elaborate attempt to run away from home. Kara Alongi, 16, posted a misspelled message to her Twitter page around 6.20pm Sunday night that gave the impression that she was in a panic. 'There is someone in my hour ecall 911' she wrote. Suspicious claim: Kara Alongi, 16, posted this message to Twitter around 6.20om on Sunday night while her family was out watching her younger brother's sporting game . Her Twitter followers did not call the authorities, but her parents did once they returned to the family home in Clark, New Jersey and realized that the girl was missing. At the time of her disappearance, her family were watching her younger brother's sporting event. Police brought a canine unit to the home and, according to their press release, the dogs 'tracked Kara's scent from the back door of the house, through a neighbor's yard and then to the sidewalk and around the corner back onto her block where the scent goes cold.' After initially believing the Tweet, police became suspicious because there were no signs of foul play or abduction. Disappeared: Police traced a phone call placed from her house to a local cab company around the same time as the Tweet, and the cab driver identified her as the girl he picked up . The biggest sign, however, that something was amiss came from phone records that showed someone in the Alongi's home called a local taxi company and ordered a pick up at their address right around the time that Kara posted the intruder claim to Twitter. 'The investigation quickly revealed a number of inconsistencies in the teen's statement,' the police statement reveals. The local Patch site reports that police got in touch with the taxi driver who picked up the request, and the man identified Kara as the girl he drove to the nearby Rahway train station. Gone: The taxi driver took her to the nearby Rahway train station which has regular services to Manhattan . The train station serves the Northeast Corridor line and the North Jersey Coast line, both of which have their northern-most stop in Manhattan. 'Kara might feel that she will be in trouble if she comes home after this scare and causing a panic. At this point all everyone cares about is seeing her safe and at her house where she belongs,' the police statement concluded. As of noon on Monday, Kara was still listed as missing and police have not reported any further developments from their overnight search.","Girl, 16, urged Twitter followers to call police because of alleged intruder .

"Amanda Holden says that she hasn't had Botox or plastic surgery in the last three years. The actress revealed that she had previously used the injections in her face, but stopped almost three years ago, after the difficult birth of her daughter Hollie in January 2012. She made the comments during a heated debate on today's This Morning with relationship therapist Louise Van Der Velde, who advocates that women should get cosmetic surgery in order to stop their husbands and boyfriends cheating. Scroll down for video . Louise Van Der Velde was on This Morning to talk about plastic surgery - she believes women should have procedures to stay desirable for their men. The show's host Amanda Holden was angered by the comments and revealed she has stopped using botox . When Louise, 41, asked Amanda if she had previously undergone Botox or surgery, the actress said: 'Everybody knows that in the past, yes, I’ve talked about having Botox. 'Since spending too much time in intensive care after nearly losing a baby, I’ve not gone under the knife or had any injections. 'To be absolutely honest, no different, I now have a team of amazing people and I have non-invasive stuff. 'But I have facials, I buy things from well-known chemists, it's not how I look physically, it’s how my husband and how I feel about myself. 'My husband tells me every day wonderful things.' Louise and Amanda were joined on the This Morning sofa by Philip Schofield and body image campaigner Natasha Devon . Louise was on the ITV programme to discuss comments she had made to MailOnline last week, where she claimed that women in their forties should get plastic surgery or face their partner running off with a younger model. Louise, who runs a relationship therapy centre in central London, believes ladies only have themselves to blame if their husband starts to find other women more attractive. After appearing on the show,she  labelled Amanda's opinions on body image as hypocritical. She told MailOnline: 'When I asked Amanda how it (botox) made her feel, she said it didn't make her feel any different. 'Well, what's the point in having it? Why bother then? I thought that was a bit hypocritical - we only do it to make ourselves feel good.' She and Amanda were joined on the This Morning sofa by Philip Schofield and body image campaigner Natasha Devon. Natasha argued against Louise's standpoint, saying: 'I find the argument quite offensive as a woman that the way I look is what I bring to a relationship. 'However much surgery we get, old age will come to us all. 'I think every woman is beautiful in her own way, there’s always someone who will be conventionally more beautiful than you, but we’re putting ourselves in this global hierarchy.' But Louise was also critical of Natasha's stance on the topics after the programme ended. She said: 'It's the same thing - she's sitting there and has just spent hours in make-up and hair. 'I've seen her talking about how her lips are her best asset, when she sitting there saying it's not about looks or appearance. 'It's all a bit hypocritical.' Louise Van Der Velde, 41, runs a relationship therapy centre in London, she believes women only have themselves to blame if their man cheats and should get plastic surgery to stay desirable . Louise told MailOnline last week: 'I think for the people who do want to have a monogamous relationship – the women are very quick to point the finger. 'They say that their husband is messing about and he’s left them for someone else, but I think it is absolutely the woman's responsibility when they have let themselves go over the years. 'We are the creators of our own destiny, if your fella cheats, you’ve created it yourself. 'The men have a right to look elsewhere, they have a right to be sleeping with an attractive woman.' Apparently it could be worse though, while British and American women are not in good shape, Louise reserves her harshest criticism for ladies from some of the countries on the European mainland. She said: ' I lived in Spain for fifteen years and the women there, they age because they eat all of these cakes and bread. 'A lot of the women, when they hit 50 they are pretty much a write-off in some of those countries, but it doesn’t have to be that way.' Louise provides advice for women whose men have been unfaithful . Steering clear of cakes and keeping in shape with regular visits to the gym is not enough though - Louise thinks that women should start to have breast augmentation, liposuction, fillers and the rest as soon as parts of the body start to sag. She said: 'A lot of my female clients in their forties and fifties come in and they’re unhappy that their husbands are playing away but they’ve let themselves go. 'But no one’s really happy with themselves when they are overweight and not looking good. 'Even when you buy a new dress you feel good – looking good is feeling good. 'I actively encourage my clients to get plastic surgery and it’s received fairly well. 'I have had the odd client who think they should be accepted for who they are but some of them have taken it up. Louise believes women should look into cosmetic surgery as soon as their skin start to sag (picture posed by models) 'I’ve had some ladies who have had liposuction done for their weight and some who've had the gastric band. 'There are also some who've had their eyes and breasts done as well. 'Faces get saggy and a little bit of filler is good, it’s very important that you find the right surgeon though. 'Some of the TOWIE girls go totally over the top and they begin looking like this plastic. It doesn’t have to be like that. 'If you have a good surgeon, they’ll do it the right way.' Louise claims to have had serious success with her pro-plastic surgery approach to healing marriages. But sometimes the effects can be so strong that the balance in the relationship swings completely the other way. Louise thinks that men should be allowed to look elsewhere if their partner has let themselves go . She said: 'This one woman had a boob job and it gave her a totally new lease of life. 'She decided that as her husband had cheated on her, she was going to go off anyway. 'I take my hat off to those types of women as well because I think that maybe they had been staying in the relationship because they had settled and couldn’t get anyone better.' While Louise acknowledges that her comments may seem harsh and quite extreme, she is quick to point out that she practises what she preaches and has undergone extensive cosmetic surgery herself. She said: 'People say to me it’s easy because I am a natural beauty but I work really hard to look like this. 'I decided that in my fortieth year I wanted to be the fittest I’ve ever been, so I had my boobs done. 'I  first had them done eight years ago, back then I was a 34C and went up to a 34DD and now I’m a 34 E. 'I also had under my eyes done – I had the wrinkles taken out, I’ve  also had my lips done. 'Everybody says that they can’t believe I’m 40, they all think that I look like I’m 30 and that’s a great feeling. 'I don’t believe in growing old gracefully.' It seems that Louise isn't alone in her desire to stay looking fresh as soon as the big 4-0 looms, more and more surgeons are experiencing the an influx of forty-something women checking in for adjustments. Mr Ash Mosahebi, who performed Louise's surgery at Spire Bushey Hospital said: 'I have seen a rise in patients wanting to remain younger at a younger age. 'Previously women would have come to see me in their fifties or sixties, I am now seeing more women in their forties. The most popular procedures for women of this age are breast uplifts, liposuction and blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery).' The most popular procedures for women in their forties are breast uplifts, liposuction and blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) There are some who ARE allowed to grow old gracefully though - Men. While women should get plastic surgery to hide the signs of ageing, Louise believes that men only need to keep in shape by eating well and heading to the gym. She said: 'I think men are more fortunate, they age better than women and they become more distinguished. 'So obviously they need to keep themselves fit, but as far as surgery, they get away with lines and things like that. 'I don’t think there is as much emphasis on the men needing to do it.'

"A branch of hacker group Anonymous has taken on the people they believe are involved in the cover up of a horrific rape case in Ohio where two star football players are accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl. The alleged rape took place in Steubenville, Ohio in August of last year, but because authorities did not immediately arrest the athletes involved, much of the policing has been done on the web. Officially, two boys- Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond- have been arrested and charged with raping a fellow 16-year-old, taking her to a number of parties when she was too drunk to resist, digitally penetrating her and possibly even urinating on her. Scroll down to watch video extract . Taking action: The so-called 'hacktivist' group Anonymous made a video announcing their plan to 'out' people involved in the alleged coverup of the incident . The case, which was publicized nationally by an explosive New York Times story, has split the small town of Steubenville into two sides- those who are devout fans of the football team who have chosen to support the two players, saying that the incident is the girl's fault for getting that drunk. There is also the allegation that she was drugged, but because a toxicology report was not done immediately after the alleged assault, that has not been proven. Others feel that the reason why the case . has not moved more swiftly through the legislative process is because . local officials are covering up for the start athletes, taking it as the . latest example of the hero-worship provided the teenage football . players. Horrific: Attendees at the various parties posted pictures of the two suspects dragging the seemingly unconscious victim around because she was too drunk to move . Anonymous qualifies as the latter, and an individual cell called Knight Sec has appointed themselves that internet vigilantes for the case. On their website, called Local Leaks: The Steubenville Files, they said that they took up the cause since 'a town rife with corruption, cronyism, illegal gambling  and fixated upon their star high school football team (a major economic revenue engine) were prepared to orchestrate a major cover-up in order to sweep the entire affair under the rug.' The group 'began unraveling this conspiracy of silence designed to protect a group of these high school football players who had become well known to their fellow students as “The Rape Crew”.' They go on to name and discredit a number of people involved in the case- from the sheriff involved in the investigation to the prosecuting attorney- using their tech skills to hack into individuals email accounts and publish damaging allegations. In the case of a prominent football team supporter, the group published inappropriate and pornographic photos found in his email account. The Local Leaks site has become somewhat of a collection of the various Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter posts made by students who were either present at the parties where the girl was being dragged around by the two players by her ankles and wrists. That picture was originally screen-grabbed by Alexandria Goddard, a crime blogger who used to live in Steubenville. She took it from the Instagram account of a local high school student who later tried to sue her for defamation because she posted the photo on the web. His suit was dismissed and the teenage boy publicly apologized to the victim and her family, whose names are not being reported because she is a minor and an alleged sexual assault victim. A horrifying online trail of the August 11 incident continues to emerge, and one of the latest discoveries was that of a video of a group of high school students talking about- even laughing- about the alleged rape which seems to be happening at the time the video was shot. Throughout the video, which is just over 12 minutes long, there are numerous references to a 'dead girl' who is described as being raped and urinated on. The boy who talks the most in the video has been identified as Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student and baseball player who cannot contain his laughter as he describes the 16-year-old victim, seemingly in another room of the house, being raped. 'She is so raped right now,' he says at one point in the video. Laughing boy: The 'star' of the video is Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student who can't contain his laughter as he describes the 'dead' victim, seemingly in another room of the house . Offensive: A number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online, including this one on Twitter; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence . 'There won't be any foreplay for a dead girl,' he says. 'It ain't wet now to be honest. Trust me, I'm a doctor.' The video was obtained by hacker group KnightSec and posted on Deadspin on Wednesday. Wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes t-shirt, Nodianos jokes that the girl is 'deader than a doornail' and 'they p***** on her.' He then goes on a tirade of the . figures that she's 'deader than,' including Caylee Anthony, 'O.J. Simpson's wife,' John F. Kennedy and Trayvon Martin. Fan frenzy: The Big Red plays their home games at a 10,000 seat stadium, where they are broadcast on local television . Allegation: Both of the boys facing charges are students at Steubenville High School and were on the school's prestigious football team . The city’s police chief begged for witnesses to come forward, but received little response. At least two other people who don't . appear on camera interrupt Nodianos to let inform him that the situation . is anything but a laughing matter. 'It is rape. They raped her,' one of them says. Later, he chastises Nodianos, saying: 'Like, this is not like funny... what if that was your daughter?' Nodianos responds: 'But it isn't. If that was my daughter, I wouldn't care. I would just let her be dead. 'And is it really rape if you don’t . know if she wanted to or not? She might have wanted it. That might have . been her final wish.' The names Trent and Ma'lik, are also . mentioned in the video - the names of the suspects in the case - Trent .

"Seattle out-played, out-gunned and out-manned the Denver Broncos on the way to proving defense really does win championships. The Seahawks league-best defense intercepted Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning twice and quarterback Russell Wilson played like a veteran in a dominant performance giving the team its first Super Bowl championship. Denver's miscues doomed it from the very start. A bad snap for a safety, two interceptions and two fumbles - Seattle scored almost all of its points off turnovers. 'The only way we could say we were the best defense was to take down the best offense,' said linebacker Bobby Wagner. Scroll down for videos . Champions!: Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll is doused with Gatorade towards the end of Super Bowl XLVIII . They finally won the big one:  Seahawks Owner Paul Allen celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after their 43-8 victory over the Denver Broncos . A sea of confetti: Robert Turbin walks on the confetti-covered field after winning the Super Bowl . Letting loose: Seattle Seahawks linebacker Malcom Smith makes an angel in the confetti after his team defeated the Denver Bronocs . And take them down they did. Manning was stifled by the Seahawks' hard hitting 'legion of boom' defense all game. Swarming defenders knocked Broncos players all over the field and forced three turnovers that led to points. The future hall of fame quarterback never had a chance. Seattle coach Pete Carroll's defense intercepted Manning twice in the first half, with linebacker Malcolm Smith returning the second pick 69 yards for a touchdown. Smith won Super Bowl MVP honors for the play. 'I always imagined myself making great plays, never thought about being the MVP,' Smith said. He overthrew receivers all night, threw wobbly passes and rarely had time to scan the field as Seattle's unrelenting pass rush constantly kept him under pressure. His counterpart Wilson looked like an old pro completing 18 of 25 passes for 206 yards, two touchdowns and zero interceptions, as well as three rushes for 26 yards for a quarterback rating of 123.1 - among the highest in Super Bowl history. By comparison, Denver running back Knowshon Moreno was held to 17 yards on five carries. 'We've been relentless all season,' Wilson said. 'Having that mentality of having a championship day every day. At the end of the day, you want to play your best football and that is what we did today.' Coach Pete Carroll had been repeating the mantra that every day is a championship day since the start of training camp, and it paid off. Signature play: Wide receiver Percy Harvin, #11 of the Seahawks,  returns the second half kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown that gave Seattle a 29-0 lead to start the second half . Intercepted!: Strong safety Kam Chancellor #31 of the Seattle Seahawks intercepts a pass from Peyton Manning . The scoring started when an errant Broncos snap led to a safety on the first play from scrimmage to give Seattle a 2-0 lead and the ball. Seattle’s second play from scrimmage resulted in a 30 yard run from speedy wide receiver Percy Harvin, notable because he was playing in only his third game all season after suffering through a multitude of injuries and recovering from offseason hip surgery. Harvin only had 38 total yards all season, but amassed 137 yards on the night. Wilson overcame early nerves to completed his next two passes and carried the ball twice for 10 yards to set up a Stephen Hauschka 31 yard field goal that gave the Seahawks a 5-0 lead with 10:22 left in the first quarter. Seattle tacked on a second field goal . following their next drive to take an 8-0 lead. First score: Denver Broncos' Knowshon Moreno (27) recovers the football in the end zone for a safety as Seattle Seahawks' Heath Farwell (55) and teammate Julius Thomas (80) chase him . Feb 2, 2014; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; Denver Broncos running back Knowshon Moreno (27) recovers a fumble in the end zone for a safety that gave Seattle a 2-0 lead . The Broncos' offensive struggles . continued through the first quarter. They went three and out their next . drive, punctuated by an earth shattering hit from Kam Chancellor on . Broncos receiver Demarius Thomas. The Broncos next drive ended when Chancellor intercepted an errant Manning throw that resulted in Seattle's first touchdown. The second quarter saw much of the same, as Seattle methodically drove down the field down the field and capitalized on a Denver pass . interference penalty in the end zone to take a 15-0 lead on a Marshawn . Lynch 1 yard touchdown run. Lynch ended the game with 39 yards on 15 carries. Wilson completed 9 of 14 passes for 94 yards in the first half and ran for 10 . more yards on two carries while safety Kam Chancellor and Seattle’s defense held the Broncos scoreless. 'It's all about making history,' said All-Pro safety Earl Thomas. 'This was a dominant performance from top to bottom.' Ineffective: Manning #18, shown throwing the first of his two interceptions on the game . On the money: Seattle Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka (4) kicks a 31 yard field goal during the first half of the Super Bowl . Previous: A spectacular touchdown by Percy Harvin (left) of the Seattle Seahawks during the 2014 Super Bowl held the previous record for a most-tweeted moment . The second quarter looked to be a welcome change for the five-time MVP, but it was only an illusion. Manning finally put together a sustained drive, moving the ball 49 yards over 16 plays while completing 7 of 9 passes for 45 yards before throwing one of those 'ducks' Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman referred to in the days leading up to the game. Manning finally looked to have . established himself before his arm was hit on a short pass intended for . running back Knowshon Moreno. Beast mode: Seahawks' Marshawn Lynch (24) rushes for a touchdown during the first half . Pick six!: Seahawks' Malcolm Smith (53) intercepts a pass intended for Denver Broncos' Knowshon Moreno (27), which was returned 69 yards for a touchdown . The wobbly throw was picked off by Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith and returned 69 yards for a touchdown and a 22-0 lead for Seattle. Manning's dismal first half was punctuated by another duck thrown on 4th and two with 1:01 left, it barely missed being intercepted. He finished the first half 17 of 23 for 104 . yards and was shown walking off the field with his tail between his legs . before time even expired in the second quarter - one that will likely . haunt him for many years. 'Certainly to finish this way is very disappointing. It's not an easy pill to swallow,' said Manning. 'I don't know if you ever really get over it.' Off to the races: Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin (11) returns a kickoff for a touchdown to start the second half . The nightmare only continued in the . second when Denver kick Matthew Prater went for hang time on the opening . kick as he tried to give his coverage team enough time to get to the . dangerous Harvin. Harvin . missed the NFC championship two weeks ago after suffering a concussion . during an earlier playoff game, and clearly benefited from the rest. He . caught the ball at the 13-yard line and took off, blowing past three . would-be tacklers and streaking down the middle of the field for the . Super Bowl's signature play to this point. The play put the Broncos championship parade plans to bed for good. 'This is an amazing team. Took us four . years to get to this point, but they never have taken a step sideways,' coach Pete Carroll said. 'These guys would not take anything but winning . this ballgame.' Carroll's first championship as an NFL coach comes after failed stints with the New York Jets and New England Patriots saw him cast into the college ranks. All Carroll did at the University of Southern California was win two national titles and produce one of the game's great dynasties during his nine years in charge. He won the Super Bowl in his fourth year at the helm in Seattle. Wilson threw a strike over the middle to receiver Jermaine Kearse later in the third quarter that he caught while spinning out of several tackles and ran into the endzone for a touchdown to make the score 36-0. Sepctacular: The Seahawks' Jermaine Kearse makes a spinning catch against Denver Broncos' Tony Carter before spinning out of two more tackles and running to the end zone for a touchdown . Game over: The Broncos scored a touchdown after Kearse's score, but they never came close to making it a contest . Dejected: Manning walks off the field after not converting on fourth down during the fourth quarter . Manning found Thomas for a touchdown on the ensuing drive, one of the receiver's Super Bowl-record 13 receptions on the game, but it was too little too late. He finished 33 of 47 for 266 yards, one touchdown and 266 yards. Seattle stayed pedal to the medal on the next drive, with Wilson completing 5 of his 5 passes for 58 yards and his second touchdown of the game to make it 43-8 with 11:45 remaining in the game. Richard Sherman, for all his bluster before the game, went out with a whimper when he injured his ankle early in the fourth quarter. He was taken off the field on a cart and returned later on crutches. Oddly enough, Manning's 34 completions were a Super Bowl record, but his turnovers did a hole the Broncos never found a way out of - and it may be the last time he dons a uniform because of recurring neck injuries he will address in the offseason. Oh, and, about the weather that so many people were concerned with for so many months - temperatures held steady in the mid-40s and the only thing resembling snow that came close to the field was a shower of confetti at the end.","The game's first score came after a snap sailed over Denver quarterback Peyton Manning's head and into the end zone for a safety .

The twins were born healthy through IVF just after 36 weeks and will not be leaving the hospital for some time . Five people were sentenced to six years imprisonment following the fire at Doha's Villagio mall on May 28 last year. All 19 victims were foreigners, including 13 children, four teachers and and two firefighters. Investigators said that the fire that broke out next to the unlicensed Gympanzee nursery was caused by an electrical fault. At . the time Mr Weekes said he and his wife, who lived in Doha where he was . working, mourned the loss of 'the sunshine in our world.' 'Tragically they left together after only two short years,' he said. 'A . time that was lived to the full every day with us laughing, playing, . waking us at all hours of the night and simply being the sunshine in our . world.'

'So we are pleasantly surprised - if you ca say you are surprised and happy about the fact that people have been held accountable for the death of your children.' Among those convicted were Sheikh Ali Bin Jassem al-Thani, a co-owner of the nursery from the ruling family and Qatar's ambassador to Belgium.

Alexis Sanchez's sumptuous free-kick gave Arsenal the lead but goals from Dusan Tadic and Nathaniel Clyne earned the visitors an impressive victory and a place in the Capital One Cup fourth round in the process.

"This is the Transfer Column, where Sportsmail delivers the very latest news, gossip and rumours from around the football world three times a week. In this column, Real Madrid's Fabio Coentrao could be available to Man United for £12.5million, Spurs, in turn, want United left-back Alexander Buttner and Arsenal are in a three-way battle with Barcelona and Juventus for goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Manchester United have been encouraged to bid for Real Madrid left-back Fabio Coentrao with the Spanish club prepared to take a 50 per cent hit on the £25million fee they paid for him. Coentrao was the subject of a loan bid from United at the 11th hour of the summer transfer window. The deal fell through but the player has endured a tough time suffering a hamstring injury while with the Portugal national side and losing his father in November. He is eager to make a fresh start and a move to Old Trafford appeals. The main man? Man United are being urged to bid for out-of-favour Real Madrid left-back Fabio Coentrao . United will not move for Leighton Baines in January. Manager David Moyes remains a fan but Everton's £15million valuation and Baines's age, 29, do not make good business sense. Baines would have to ask for a transfer for the deal to have any chance of being revived and that will not happen. Everton will now look at fresh talks over a new deal for the England international. United's concern over Coentrao is the fact he hasn't played many games, having appeared just four times in La Liga this season. However, he returned to training yesterday and is fit to play. No longer required: Everton's Leighton Baines is not Manchester United's principal left-back target . United have watched Alberto Moreno at Sevilla, who Real Madrid also like, and Domenico Criscito at Zenit St Petersburg while Luke Shaw of Southampton is a talent they would like to sign. Chelsea, though, are in the driving seat for Shaw and he will likely stay at Southampton until the summer. Tottenham also like Coentrao but have made enquiries over United's left-back Alexander Buttner who Moyes is willing to let go on loan with a view to a permanent deal. Patrice Evra could yet sign a new contract at Old Trafford but remains in the sights of Monaco and Paris St Germain. Prank: Talk of a £30m offer from Man United for Atletico's Koke (right) has been dismissed as a prank . Meanwhile, reports of a £30million United bid for Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke have been dismissed as a prank. Stories suggested a deal had been agreed between the two clubs on December 28, the Dia de los Santos Inocentes which is Spain's version of April Fool's Day. Arsenal are keen on German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen but will have to move quickly if they want to sign him. The 21-year-old is close to agreeing terms with Barcelona to replace Victor Valdes, while Juventus have also approached his advisors as they consider a successor for Gianluigi Buffon. Ter Stegen has been impressive at Borussia Monchengladbach where he is under contract until 2015. Arsenal expect to lose Lukasz Fabianski next month with Schalke favourites, Wojciech Szczesny has been in good form but Arsenal are planning ahead and they recognise the potential for a lot of new recruits from the Bundesliga. Serge Gnabry, who Arsenal brought in from Stuttgart, may be allowed out on loan over the next few weeks depending on injuries. Wigan's German manager Uwe Rosler is among those keen to take the 18-year-old winger. In demand: Borussia Monchengladbach's 20 year-old keeper Ter Stegen, right, is wanted by Arsenal, Barcelona and Juventus . The future of Manchester City striker John Guidetti could become clearer later today with Stoke City and West Ham United keen. The 21-year-old is in demand after battling back to fitness following injury and a debilitating virus. He scored 20 goals in 23 games while with Feyenoord in 2011-12 and a queue of clubs, including Malaga, Real Betis and Lazio are among clubs those keen to take him on loan. Out of the picture: Man City's John Guidetti (second right) is a January loan target for Stoke and West Ham . However, City and his representatives want him to realise his potential in England and are talking to Stoke City and West Ham about a deal until the end of the season. Both clubs are keen to explore options in the loan market and Guidetti could prove great value if he recaptures the form he showed in Holland. City are reluctant to let other players leave in January with Jack Rodwell, Javi Garcia and Joleon Lescott all subject to interest at home and abroad. Striker Edin Dzeko is wanted by both Milan clubs and Valencia among many others and if anyone bids £25million then City may yet contemplate a deal but a summer exit is more likely. Goal threat: West Ham are considering moves for Roma pair Marco Borriello and Nicolas Burdisso . West Ham, meanwhile, have several other . striker targets. They were due to hold a meeting with Roma's sporting . director Walter Sabatini at the weekend who is looking to offload Marco . Borriello and Nicolas Burdisso but the meeting was put off with Fulham . and Tottenham reputedly speaking to Sabatini instead. Juventus director Beppe Moratta is also in London as they look to find buyers for Mirko Vucinic and Fabio Quagliarella. Juve are also keen to sign a winger. A deal for United's Luis Nani looks unlikely but they have asked about Chelsea's Kevin de Bruyne and Real Madrid's Angel di Maria also. Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien could leave Stamford Bridge in the January transfer window. Essien's agent Fabian Piveteau, who represents the former Ghana international, told French radio that a number of 'major European clubs' have been notified of the 31-year-old’s availability with his freedom to play in the Champions League an added attraction. 'Essien could leave Chelsea this winter,' Piveteau told RMC. 'Several major European clubs playing in the Champions League were informed and the situation should settle down within the next 10 days. Lack of opportunities: Chelsea's Michael Essien could be on his way out of Stamford Bridge in January . 'You should know that Michael was not on the list of players who can play in the Champions League with Chelsea, so he is free to play in the competition with another club.' Essien, although a favourite of Jose Mourinho, has struggled to make an impression on Chelsea's first team this season. Chelsea, meanwhile, are continuing to gather information on Radamel Falcao at Monaco. Mourinho has made no secret of wanting a striker, with Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa also in his thinking. Coincidentally, Monaco have also expressed an interest in Costa who Atletico insist is not for sale until the summer despite the player carrying a £32million buyout clause. PSV Eindhoven have confirmed they tried to sign Chelsea's Thorgan Hazard on loan. Hazard is on loan at Zulte-Waregem but the younger brother of Eden could join Anderlecht when the transfer window reopens. Loan star? PSV Eindhoven have confirmed they want Chelsea's Thorgan Hazard, brother of Eden, on loan . Which former young Premier League player has been given an allowance by his agent in a bid to stop his frivolous spending? The final straw came when the player in question bought himself a brand new car for £26,000, even though he doesn't drive. The father of Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has poured cold water on speculation linking the striker to a move to Barcelona. There has been much clamour in their native Argentina for Aguero to link up with Lionel Messi at Barcelona. City would also move for Messi if they felt there was a chance of him leaving Spain. However, the two friends will come face to face in the Champions League next year. Leonel del Castillo, Aguero’s father, said: 'I would like to see Sergio and Messi playing together, but there is nothing at all. 'Sergio and Leo always speak and more after the Champions League draw. They're good friends, like laughing and they're already joking between them ahead the City v Barça clash. Going nowhere: Sergio Aguero's dad has poured cold water over rumours his son is off to Barcelona . 'We will see two great games. I don't know if I will visit Messi's home, but I will go to hotel for sure to say hello to him. I think it will be a 2-0 in England and at least a 0-1 in Barcelona. I love Messi so much, but I want my son's team to win.' Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke has derided talk that Ilkay Gundogan is close to a move to Real Madrid. The Germany international has 18 months left on his contract and is admired by Manchester United and Arsenal. Although the player's father recently claimed that Carlo Ancelotti's side are to make a move for his signature, Watzke said: 'If we believed everything in the Spanish media about players supposedly leaving us, we would have to worry about getting a team together. We do not know from Ilkay or his father [who is also his agent] that he wants to leave.' High achiever: Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan is staying put in January, his dad has said . FC Groningen want to open talks with Liverpool about a deal to sign Krisztian Adorjan on a permanent basis. Adorjan has been on loan at Groningen and the Dutch club had to let Liverpool know before April if they wanted to buy the 20-year-old. Adorjan has impressed in the Eredivisie and Groningen are hoping to tie up a deal in the region of £200,000. Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis and chairman Steve Parish were among spectators at Charlton Athletic versus Sheffield Wednesday yesterday. Pulis has a budget of around £15million to spend and ideally wants a goalkeeper, centre-back, midfielder and two strikers.

"Kevin Pietersen claims it was 'a relief' to escape the England dressing room when he was ditched from the team following the 5-0 Ashes whitewash Down Under. But England's record international run-scorer insists he remains on good terms with his former colleagues, and believes the reason his old colleague Ashley Giles was overlooked for the role of head coach after the winter Ashes debacle was because of their close friendship. There looks to be no way back for Pietersen, 33, after his central contract was terminated in February following the thrashing in Australia, in which he finished as England's leading run-scorer but also faced criticism over his batting and his demeanour.

'We were losing and in my opinion the environment was poor and I was not alone in thinking that. It is a view shared by a number of the players who have spoken their minds since coming back from the tour.' He claims fellow England players found the attentions of the Australian media 'a problem' and said the tourists were 'not equipped to handle' the test of a tour Down Under so soon after winning the Ashes at home. Pietersen asserts that his relationship was 'fine' with fellow squad members, adding: 'I have no issue with the players, as many have said in interviews since the tour ended.

"British diplomats have unveiled their secret weapon in the battle to win over North Korea and bring the impoverished dictatorship into line with more enlightened nations... The Teletubbies. The children’s television show is among several classic series being considered for export to North Korea, which has little exposure to western culture and is ruled with an iron fist by tyrant Kim Jong-Un. Foreign Office experts are said to be . helping BBC Worldwide – the corporation’s commercial arm – choose . suitable, inoffensive programmes to sell to its state broadcaster. The children's show Teletubbies has been shown all across the world and could, it is believed, be broadcast in the closed regime of North Korean if a deal is agreed . North Korean leader Kim Jong-un delivering a speech through the North's Central Television Station in Pyongyang, North Korea. The station could soon be showing BBC programmes . The . Teletubbies are in the running because the four characters – Dipsy, . La-La, Tinky Winky and Po – do not have any dialogue. If successful, . such a move could perhaps open the door to shows from other British . broadcasters, such as ITV’s Mr Bean, starring Rowan Atkinson. Series . that reveal something of the British way of life, such as EastEnders or . The Good Life, would also be suitable choices, a Foreign Office source . told The Sunday Times. In a letter to the Commons foreign . affairs committee, Mr Hague wrote: 'In the long term this is a good way to . improve understanding about the outside world within such a closed . society.

In November, the BBC claimed its science fiction drama Doctor Who became one of the world's biggest TV shows after a special 50th anniversary episode was watched in 94 countries. The episode was simultaneously screened in 3D to more than half a million people in cinemas across Latin America, North America and Europe. BBC Worldwide's other top selling shows include Africa, Top Gear and Parade's End. The foreign affairs committee chairman, Sir Richard Ottaway, said: 'This is a good use of British soft power.'

"An Australian girl who fell in love with London when she moved here has had a detailed map of her favourite park tattooed on her thigh. Jessica Pinney, 28, said walks through Richmond Park, the largest of London's eight Royal Parks, helped her beat depression when she lived in England. Although she's now back in Melbourne, she says the park is still part of her. Big fan: Jessica Pinney said that Richmond Park 'feels like home' so she wanted to have it with her all the time . Attention to detail: Miss Pinney will never get lost walking around Richmond Park with her handy map tattoo . After splashing out £185 on the painstaking picture, she explained: 'I feel like Richmond Park is my home and I wanted to have it tattooed on me so it's always with me and I'm kind of always there. 'It'll be hilarious if I ever get asked for directions in the park again - I can pull down my trousers or pull up my skirt and give them some really good advice.' Miss Pinney came to live with her parents in Richmond in 2004 when she went through a major depressive episode and would visit the park every day to help her cope. She said: 'I went to the park every day and it made everything bearable. Since then I've never felt as at ease or as at home as I do when I'm in the park. 'I learned everything I could and am still learning about it and the wildlife there. 'I got obsessed with the rut and all the seasonal changes and the different birds and waterfowl there.' A piece of London: Miss Pinney is back in her native Australia now, but has a lasting momento of her time here . From Gallows Hill to East Sheen Common: She says that she is looking forward to examining her tattoo next time she is asked for directions in Richmond Park . Miss Pinney, who works as a sound artist, had the park inked on her left thigh in a three-and-a-half hour session by Melbourne tattoo artist Olivia Brumen. She said: 'At first it didn't hurt much but after the first hour or so my skin got incredibly sensitive and the rest of the time was a quite torturous. It was worth it though. 'It was a lot of work for the artist - she did such an amazing job of all that detail and line work.' The tattoo combines the current map of . the park with an older one and includes some personal place names such . as Witchy Woods, instead of Sidmouth Wood. She paid £185 for the design and plans to get some red or fallow deer antlers on the inside of her arm when she returns to Richmond in August.","Jessica Pinney got the map tattoo when she moved back to Australia .

"Labour is ‘playing politics with prosperity’ by refusing to give full backing to the planned High Speed 2 railway, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will say today. Ministers will seek to demonstrate their commitment to the £50billion project this week by unveiling plans to extend it all the way to Scotland. But Mr McLoughlin will warn that the plans will face the axe unless Ed Miliband’s party shows ‘resolution’ and backs them. The Transport Secretary will criticise Labour for failing its own politicians in the North and Midlands by refusing to fully back the £50bn project claiming it would bring the areas economic benefits . The Government will present a new business case for HS2 today in a report arguing that the new line – from London to Birmingham and on to Leeds and Manchester – is vital for economic growth in the North of England. The report will warn that ditching HS2 and upgrading existing lines instead could lead to 14 years of disruption on the railways. The study, compiled by Network Rail, warns that a ‘very unattractive’ package of closures, diversions and delays would be needed. The report – the latest attempt to persuade a sceptical public that the plans are vital for national renewal – will present a new cost-benefit analysis of the scheme. Labour MPs are expected to abstain in a Commons vote on Thursday designed to pave the way for HS2 amid signs that Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls wants to withdraw the party’s backing and spend the money on something else. But in a speech to launch the report, Mr McLoughlin will say: ‘Big projects need “broad political consensus” as well as “resolution” from political leaders. ‘That’s why the new north-south railway must be a national project with broad support across parties, or in the end it will be nothing.’ He will warn Mr Miliband that undermining the project has already angered Labour council leaders in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Sheffield. Mr McLoughlin will say: ‘They know that any threat to the new line is also a threat to the future of the North and the Midlands, to the Britain beyond London.’ Confronting the Labour leadership, he will argue: ‘You can’t say one day you back better infrastructure, only the next threaten to stop it being built. The scheme has encountered opposition from both Tory and Labour politicians over the cost and route . ‘You can’t go on claiming to want one nation if you won’t back  the things that will bring it  together. You can’t play politics with our prosperity.’ Last night Labour MP Graham Stringer said his party’s leaders ‘should stop playing games’. He added: ‘It was a Labour project, announced by a Labour government, and they should be supporting it.’ In a clear sign that the Coalition is committed to the project, Lib Dem transport minister Baroness Kramer will on Friday announce the start of a study to work out the costs and benefits of extending it to Scotland. Under the existing plans, the HS2 line will run from London to Birmingham, before splitting towards Manchester and Leeds. Department for Transport sources said extending it could mean the two lines going on to Glasgow and Edinburgh. HS2 has been beset by claims that the £42billion cost of the English lines and the £8billion required for rolling stock could end up soaring to £80billion. Mr McLoughlin will say the Government delivered the Channel Tunnel rail link and the Olympics on time and on budget. However, the ability of his department is called into question by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in a report on the £3.55billion Thameslink rail project. It questions the way the DfT tackled the cross-London project, due for completion in 2018. The report says the award of a £1.6billion private finance contract for new trains for Thameslink was delayed by more than three years and that passengers had to wait for around 30 years for the scheme to go ahead. The committee concluded: ‘We remain concerned about the department’s skills and capacity to complete Thameslink by 2018, alongside its ambitious wider portfolio of programmes and projects.’ The committee also expressed concern that a senior member of the Thameslink team was moving to the HS2 scheme, saying the DfT ‘suffers from a shortage of strong project-management skills’.","Patrick McLoughlin will say Labour is depriving North of economic benefits .

On their first full day of . engagements in Ottawa, the launch pad for their gruelling 11 day tour of . Canada and the U.S., the couple attended a Citizenship Ceremony.

Each took the Oath of Citizenship, professing loyalty to the prince’s grandmother, the Queen. As each new citizen stepped forward, . William presented them with a folded Canadian flag before his wife then . handed over a small hand flag. Then it was off to the official . Canada Day celebrations in an open-topped carriage similar to the one . the couple used on the way back to Buckingham Palace following their . April wedding. The state landau was built in the . 1890s from hand-wrought iron and carved wood. It was bought by Governor . General Earl Grey in 1911 for $4,000 and donated to the nation. But the stifling heat took its toll and Kate’s make-up began to melt. She gestured towards her cheeks and told Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s wife Laureen: ‘I’m just so hot. It’s incredible.’ Hosts: William and Catherine followed by Canada's Governor General David Johnston and his wife Sharon on the escalator (left) as they arrive for the Citizenship Ceremony where they were seated together on stage .

William also gave a short speech to . thunderous applause and high pitched screams in which he thanked the . Canadian people for their welcome. He talked of his and Kate's family ties to Canada - in . French and English, as he had a day earlier. The star attraction: Signs carried by the crowd included 'Canada loves Will and Kate' Prince William said that Kate had learned about .

"The world's super-rich are turning their backs on posh boutiques and are opting to spend their millions on luxury experiences instead, according to a new report. The richest people on the planet are no longer satisfied with owning luxury, they now want to experience it by forking out for unusual adrenalin-filled holidays, gourmet dining and art. In total, of the $1.8tn (£1.1tn) spent on luxury last year, up to $1tn (£0.6tn) went towards extreme holidays, fine wining and dining, attending art auctions and other pricey activities. The world's super-rich spent more money on experiences than luxury material goods during 2013 . This graph shows how the super-rich's spending was divided in 2013 with more cash being spent on travel and 'experiential luxury' as opposed to personal luxury goods like jewellery and leather goods . Experts have said that what is considered 'luxury' is switching from 'having' to 'being'. The Boston Consulting Group's report has . said that the world's richest want to spend their wealth on things . money usually can't buy. Private airline flights . Luxury slimming clinics . Five-star hospitals which offer a butler service . Adrenalin-filled holidays such as trips to the Antarctic and tailor-made safaris . Gourmet dining . Fine art and wine . ‘They already have the luxury toys; the cars and the jewellery,’ said BCG senior partner Antonella Mei-Pochtler, explaining why super-rich spending is changing, according to The Guardian. The paper said private airline flights, luxury slimming clinics, five-star hospitals and butlers were on the list of things to spend on during the year. But there was still room for the super-rich to invest in the material, with spending on luxury cars standing at around $400bn (£240bn). Nearly as much was spent in the rest of the personal luxury goods market. Around $50bn (£30bn) was spent on cosmetics, $150bn (£91bn) on watches and jewellery and at least $60bn (£36bn) on apparel. The super rich are spending less on material goods such as jewellery, clothes and leather goods . Despite the switch towards spending on experience, the report showed  (£240bn) was spent on luxury cars . And BCG has predicted that the personal luxury goods market will grow at a rate of around 7 per cent annually over the next two years. Together, the Chinese, Brazilians, Russians and Indians account for more than 30 per cent of luxury consumption, according to the paper. The report also shows that $460bn (£280bn) was spent on rare travel opportunities, including trips to the Antarctic. Some $170bn (£100bn), meanwhile, was spent on the more predictable designer clothes and handbags. One Chinese . multimillionaire spent £900,000 on a tailor-made package holiday . that took him to 1,000 UNESCO heritage sites and that lasted for two years, according to The Guardian. There is a growing ‘sugar generation’ which describes the young rich consumers . in China. They currently account for 13 per cent of the nation's super-rich – but this is expected to rise to . 30 per cent within five years. Also included in the spending report was Louis Vuitton owner LVMH who spent $2.6bn (£1.6bn) buying cashmere clothier Loro Piana. He also acquired Nicholas Kirkwood, J.W. Anderson, and Hotel Saint-Barth Isle de France in the Caribbean during the year.","Of $1.8tn (£1.1tn) spent on luxury last year, up to $1tn (£0.6tn) went towards 'being' rather than 'having'

"Ryan Dickinson was imprisoned for 17 . months for part in June carnage . Hundreds of Vancouver Canucks fans took part in violence after losing Stanley Cup to Boston Bruins . An ice hockey fan who went on the rampage in Vancouver after his team lost the Stanley Cup has been the first to be jailed for his part in a mass riot. Ryan Dickinson was imprisoned for 17 months after using a newspaper box to repeatedly smash a police car and the leg of a barricade to destroy another in June last year.

Dozens of shop windows were smashed and looted by fans shouting:'I hate you, Boston!'

'His persistent and deliberate actions were not consistent with someone who merely got caught up in the moment,' he said. Dickinson, of Coquitlam, British Columbia, pleaded guilty to taking part in the riot after the seventh game of the Stanley Cup finals. To date, a total of 350 charges have been recommended against 125 accused. The ugly scenes brought back memories of a riot that erupted when Vancouver also lost the Stanley Cup in 1994. Dickinson had breached a curfew on the night of June 15 last year, set because of a previous assault charge the judge said was 'unsettling, as it involved serious personal violence.' 'Mr Dickinson’s participation was serious and involved a number of conscious and deliberate decisions on his part, starting with his decision to go downtown knowing that would result in a breach of his bail,' he added. Riots: Cars were overturned and set on fire in downtown Vancouver after the Canucks lost 4-0 . Up in flames: Thick smoke rose from the burning vehicles as fans reacted to their team's unexpected loss . A pre-sentence report said he lived in an 'unstable and dysfunctional family environment' and 'without discipline.' Dickinson’s probation officer added he has a 'disregard for his parents’ authority, the educational system and the justice system,' started drinking alcohol at 12 and had lost jobs because of his addiction. Police said today that his imprisonment was a 'victory for the victims and citizens of Vancouver' Crazed: A Canucks fan stands with a hockey stick outside a bank during the disorder, the windows of which have been smashed .","Ryan Dickinson was imprisoned for 17 .

"Louis van Gaal gave a prickly reaction to questions about his relationship with Dutch compatriot Ronald Koeman ahead of Manchester United's trip to Southampton on Monday. The two men have barely spoken since Van Gaal left his job as Ajax's director of football 10 years ago claiming that he had been undermined by Koeman who was coach at the time. Van Gaal was reluctant to talk about Koeman on Friday and was grudging in his praise of what the new Southampton boss has achieved at St Mary's this season, guiding his team to third place – one above United – after losing a number of key players in the summer. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: My relationship with Koeman is private . Louis van Gaal refused to discuss his relationship with Southampton boss Ronald Koeman . The two men have barely spoken since Van Gaal left his job as Ajax's director of football 10 years ago . 'I don't have to describe my relationship with the trainer of the opponent,' said Van Gaal. 'We play against Southampton and we have to speak about them and not the trainer-coach. 'I've read that (how many players Southampton lost) but do you know how many players we lost? I've never read that in the media. We have lost more players. 'Ronald Koeman is a very good coach and I know that he can do that but it's also surprising me that a club like Southampton is in that position but that is always a matter of coach, players and staff. When you do that, it's very good. 'Southampton are able to come in the first four but that's also because I believe in the management of Ronald Koeman and his brother. When the cohesion is good he can manage.' Asked about United having to pay more for players than Southampton, Van Gaal added: 'I don't think money is the question. When Manchester United are coming, clubs ask for more money and then we have to pay because we're Manchester United. 'Do you think Southampton paid so much for the players? No I don't think so because they are Southampton and not Manchester United. 'There is always a relationship between Real Madrid and Manchester United and teams like Aston Villa and Southampton.' Van Gaal, seen here with Koeman at Barcelona, claimed the Saints boss had undermined him . Van Gaal shares a joke with his players during United's training session on Friday . Van Gaal signed Luke Shaw from Saints last summer and were also linked with a move for Adam Lallana, who eventually joined Liverpool in a £25million deal. 'They have a very good squad,' said the Dutchman. 'I know a lot of players and a lot of players were offered to us.'","Manchester United take on Southampton on Monday .

"Spanish officials treated EU inspectors to a slap-up lunch today before taking them to the border with Gibraltar to highlight their concerns about smuggling. European Commission experts spent the first part of their fact-finding mission in the Rock gathering information on border queues that have sparked a diplomatic row between Britain and Spain. But they enjoyed Spanish hospitality ahead of their afternoon the other side of the border in the town of La Linea. Border queues have been causing diplomatic tensions as Gibraltar citizens claim they are in retaliation for trying to build an artificial reef in disputed waters . Spanish foreign ministry officials took them to an upmarket restaurant called Aqa overlooking the sea. They kicked off with an aperitif before tucking into plates of Russian salad, fried squid, a cold garlic-heavy tomato soup called Salmorejo and tuna kebabs. The special menu included a lemon sorbet dessert. Most of the party stuck to water although beer was provided. Police guarded the entrance to the restaurant opposite the Rock as the group were escorted to a cordoned-off first-floor dining area. The inspectors, who are looking at border and customs controls, spent around an hour and a half at the 'working lunch' before getting back to business on the ground. Tensions over Gibraltar have been rising since Spain's ruling Popular Party swept to power in elections nearly two years ago. They reached boiling point last month after Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks into the sea off the airport to stop Spanish fishermen entering their waters. Spain reacted by increasing checks on cars with the claim they were targeting cigarette smugglers and money launderers - forcing people to wait up to seven hours to cross the border from Gibraltar. However Spanish officials says they are necessary to stop smuggling and have nothing to do with disputes over Gibraltar's sovereignty . The Rock's chief minister Fabian Picardo branded the Spanish government 'neanderthal' and accused it of acting like communist north Korea after its foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo threatened to charge motorists £43 a time to cross the border. The European Commission agreed to send a fact-finding mission to the area after complaints from locals, MEPs and the Gibraltar government over the checks on traffic entering and leaving the Rock. Spain has insisted its checks are vital to tackle the scourges of cigarette smuggling and money laundering. Experts from areas including customs, justice and anti-fraud took part in today's trip. A European Commission spokesman said: 'The Commission will carry out an assessment on the basis of the information obtained during the visit and the information already provided. 'Based on this assessment, the Commission will decide if further action is necessary. 'Lunch was a working lunch and I don't see where the inspectors had lunch as a big deal. It's a long day and they had to have lunch. 'They had coffee on the Gibraltar side in the morning and from then on it was a question of timing. 'Spain is a big country with more administrative layers than Gibraltar so the Spanish side of the visit required more time.'","EU inspectors were treated to a 'working lunch' of seafood and beers .

"A four-year-old girl has survived a horrific eight-storey fall from a Gold Coast hotel, slipping over the balcony while playing hide and seek with a babysitter. The little girl was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital from the Phoenician Resort in a serious but stable condition, undergoing surgery for a broken leg on Thursday night. A witness, who saw the little girl's fall explains to investigators what he saw from the ninth floor balcony the four-year-old fell from . The four-year-old girl miraculously survived the 25 metre fall from ninth floor unit to a hedge on the first level . She also suffered abdominal injuries when she landed in a hedge after plunging 25 metres from her ninth floor unit. It's understood the child was 'playing games' with a babysitter and her parents were not present. Investigators are relieved that the little girl fell in the hedge. She escaped with only minor injuries, including a broken leg and abdominal injuries, thanks to the garden bed that broke her fall . Witnesses heard a loud thud and then saw the little girl crawling out from the garden, according to Nine News. It’s reported the child, who landed on the first floor pool deck, was dazed and not crying. She miraculously escaped with only minor injuries. Police have launched an investigation, with the Child Protection Investigation Unit investigating the circumstances that led up to the accident. ‘Police have attended the Gold Coast University Hospital and also the incident scene at Broadbeach to conduct a preliminary inquiry,’ Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia.

"Her home is a tent, her parents missing and her younger brothers going hungry but there's nothing that Emma, 17, can do about it. She is just one of a growing number of Southern Sudanese children forced to become both mother and father to her younger siblings after the latest round of fighting in Africa's newest country left them penniless refugees in a camp in northern Uganda. 'We started hearing the gun shots while . our parents were out, and we tried to stay at home, but we heard people . screaming. So we packed our things and left,' says Emma. Difficult: Emma, 17, was forced to flee from the fighting in South Sudan with her three younger brothers in tow . 'There’s no education and I can’t . achieve my dream of being an accountant. I wanted to help my mother and my . people. I wanted everyone to be educated. She adds: 'I don’t know where my mother is.' Like Emma and her brothers, Kathryn, also 17, calls the Baratuku refugee camp in Uganda's Adjumani district home. 'I ran with my brothers, without my . friends,' she explains. 'My mother was not around, so we came here. 'Getting water is . difficult, so is getting food, we’re just children without a mother. It’s a . problem. I want to study but I have to be their mother now, I have to stay with my siblings and be their mother until I find her.' According to the latest UN figures, there are now 46,874 refugees from South Sudan in Uganda’s Adjumani region, all of whom fled the fighting which broke out there last December between government forces and troops loyal to opposition leader Riek Machar. Escape: Many of the refugees currently living in northern Ugandan camps are children . A machete-wielding man chases passers-by in Juba, South Sudan. Fighting has raged since December . Currently orchestrating the opposition to the Government troops commanded by President Salva Kiir, Riek Machar is no stranger to fighting. He is also no stranger to the UK and along with completing a degree during a stay in the country, married British aid worker Emma McCune in the early 1990s - much to the horror of other aid workers. Despite the outrage, McCune went to live in South Sudan with Machar, then engaged in a long-running conflict with the Sudanese government. Although Machar was rumoured to be using child soldiers, McCune was responsible for getting 160 children to safety in the face of intense fighting. Sadly, their love was not to last. In 1993, Emma became pregnant and moved to Nairobi in Kenya with the intention of staying until the baby was born. But on 24th November 1993, she was hit by an out-of-control taxi and she and her unborn child were killed. She was just 29 years old. Many are children, and some, like Kathryn and Emma, are completely alone and at risk of everything from sexual abuse to human trafficking. According to Sarah Aguti, Plan UK’s water, sanitation and hygiene coordinator in Uganda, girls like Kathryn and Emma also face having their education curtailed and take on the lion's share of caring for their younger siblings. 'Girls have escaped the war and come here without parents, with their brothers and sisters,' she explains. 'They have nothing and they don’t know where to start from. Little girls of 16 and 17 are taking care of their siblings. 'It’s the girls who are overloaded with household chores – they do the cooking, they look for firewood and fetch the water at five o’clock in the morning. 'We are also finding many challenges in terms of accessing water – girls in such a situation find it very hard to cope because they don’t have changing rooms and they share toilets, there’s no privacy. Girls are really suffering.' 'It’s devastating to see the dire . consequences for adolescent girls in these camps, both inside and . outside South Sudan,' adds Tanya Barron, CEO of Plan UK. 'Having fled fighting and separated from their . parents, they face a daily struggle to find food, water and shelter for . themselves and their younger siblings. Frightening: One of the girls forced into northern Uganda's refugee camps following fighting in South Sudan . Thirsty work: Kathryn fetches water for her younger brothers from a spot close to the refugee camp . All smiles: Kathryn's trio of younger brothers appear to be having fun as they pose for a photograph . 'Without . support and a proper education, these girls could become a lost . generation, facing an uncertain future and few prospects. 'They face . threats including violence and early marriage which prevent them from . improving their own lives and those of their future children.' For now, the fighting rages on across the border, with experts predicting that refugees could face a wait of up to two years before being allowed to return home. While they wait, Kathryn continues to look after her brothers and sisters, and dreams that one day she will find her mother. 'I dreamt that I found her,' she says. 'I was very happy. Staying without your mum is not good. I want to be in a good place, and here is not a good place.' South Sudan has long been a tinderbox with conflicting tribal loyalties and warring leaders the driving force behind the latest outbreak of hostilities. The conflict, which broke out in December 2013, pits opposition leader Riek Machar and his largely Nuer followers, against President Salva Kiir and his supporters, most of whom are part of South Sudan's largest tribe, the Dinka. This is not the first time the two tribes have gone to war. During the liberation war against northern Sudan, Machar turned on his Dinka colleagues before being welcomed back into the fold ahead of independence. The most recent round of fighting began on 15th December 2013 when Machar decided to boycott a meeting and Kiir responded by having the Presidential Guard disarmed, with the exception of the Dinka troops. Their Nuer colleagues objected and fighting broke out, swiftly intensifying when Dinka militias in South Sudan's capital Juba began attacking Nuer civilians. According to reports, Dinka soldiers also conducted house-to-house searches in a bid to flush out civilians and were responsible for an attack on a UN compound that left two Indian peacekeepers dead. Kiir blamed the deaths on Machar and accusing him of attempting a coup. Machar retaliated by claiming Kiir was playing politics and denied planning to take power. A ceasefire agreement was reached on 25th January this year but on 18th February, it was confirmed that fighting had broken out once more.

"Scraping muck and slime from the side of a tank, and continually cloudy water, annoys many fish owners. But now a young designer has created a fish tank that she claims never needs cleaning, the water never needs changing, and owners can save money bu never needing to replace the filter. The spherical tank only requires an owner to top up the water occasionally – and to feed the fish. Scroll down for video . Cleaning up: A young designer has created a fish tank that she claims never needs cleaning, the water changing, or a new filter. The spherical tank, called Avo, (pictured) only requires an owner to top up the water occasionally – and to feed the fish. Suzy Shelley, a graduate from Loughborough University, created the 15-litre tank, which is fitted with technology that enables fish, plants and bacteria 'to work together to create a balanced ecosystem'. The tank, called Avo, has a self-cleaning filter that ‘never needs replacing’. A continually-moving bed recycles older bacteria into plant food, creating space for new bacteria to grow. ‘Harmful ammonia, nitrite and nitrate are naturally removed from the water, meaning the water never needs changing,’ according to the company, called Noux. Crystal clear: A continually-moving bed recycles older bacteria into plant food, creating space for new bacteria to grow. ‘Harmful ammonia, nitrite and nitrate are naturally removed from the water, meaning the water never needs changing,’ according to the company, called Noux. The process is illustrated . A bright idea: Avo features smart LED lighting that is optimised for plant photosynthesis and growth, which leads to clear water. It glows red in the morning, white during the day, and blue at night to look pretty in a room . Self-cleaning filter system: The plants and bacteria work together to create a balanced micro-ecosystem. The harmful ammonia, nitrite and nitrate are removed from the water meaning the water never needs changing. The filtration system is natural and self-maintaining, comprising a moving bed that doesn’t need cleaning. Automatic lighting: When there is too much light, fish tanks get algae. Avo's lighting is plant-specific, providing the wavelengths that the plants need to photosynthesise and grow, making sure they are cleaning the water efficiently. It produces wavelengths of light that our human eyes can't detect. The light moves around the tank and is magnetic, so can be detached to access the fish and plants easily. Automatic heating: Water is heated at 27°C (80.6°F) - the perfect temperature for tropical fish. The heating elements are positioned to create convection currents which help the nutrients reach the roots of plants. Plant system: Seven plant pots slot into place in the filter system to make them easy for owners to lift out and trim. Size: The tank holds three-and-a-half gallons of water (15 litres). Price: It is available to pre-order from £150 ($242). Avo features smart LED lighting that is optimised for plant photosynthesis and growth, which leads to clear water. The lighting is soft red in the morning, white during the day, and blue in the evening. The tank is designed for tropical fish with a constant water temperature of  27°C (80.6°F). The heating elements are positioned to create convection currents which help the nutrients reach the roots of plants. The plants are housed in seven trays so they can be easily maintained and moved around to change the look of the tank. It has taken Ms Shelley over four years to develop the tank, which is now raising funds on crowd funding website, Kickstarter. Avo can be pre-ordered from £150 ($242) plus shipping and the tank is due to be shipped in July next year. So far, £45,000 ($72,669) has been raised out of her £60,000 ($96,892) goal, with 52 days to go. ‘I've always kept fish and it was a steep learning curve in the early days - trying to maintain a tank properly, making sure my fish were healthy and had a clean tank,’ Ms Shelley said. ‘Fish keeping isn't as easy most people think…there's important bacteria in the tank that need to be maintained, plus there's the weekly water changes and smelly filter cleaning needed to maintain a healthy tank,’ she wrote on Avo’s Kickstarter page. ‘I decided I'd design something that takes the stress out of keeping tropical fish and makes fish keeping simple, beautiful and above all enjoyable. ‘Avo is packed full of technology and clever design features that make it really, really easy to keep fish.’ Suzy Shelley (pictured), a graduate from Loughborough University, created the 15-litre tank, which is packed with technology enabling fish, plants and bacteria 'to work together to create a balanced ecosystem'","Spherical tank requires an owner to top up the water - and to feed the fish .

"Ever had one of those days when you feel like you're taking one step forward and two steps back?

He is also seen shuffling forwards and backwards in a square shape and at one point leans right back, hovering just inches from the floor before he is able to right himself and return to an upright position. Eventually, after around two minutes, the apparent struggle to get anywhere proves too much, and the man slumps to the ground next to the gate.

"The four-month ban imposed on a senior FA official for making a sexist remark to a female referee has once again exposed the outrageously lenient treatment given to former referee David Elleray. Northumberland County FA vice-president John Cummings was suspended by an FA regulatory commission after telling referee development officer Lucy May: ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen and not on a football field.’ May, the partner of the Premier League’s youngest referee, Michael Oliver, had asked Cummings about the possibility of officiating in the North East Sunday League. David Elleray was slapped on the wrist and attended a diversity training programme for his racist comment . Cummings told her she ‘wouldn’t be able to handle it’, adding: ‘It’s nothing against you personally but all the time I’m alive, a woman will never referee in my league.’ In contrast Elleray, who remains chairman of the FA referees committee and is on the UEFA referees committee, was just slapped on the wrist and told to attend a diversity training programme after telling black FA colleague Robert McCarthy: ‘You look rather tanned, have you been down a coal mine?’ It is understood Cummings plans to appeal against his sentence and will cite the way the FA handled Elleray’s racist comment. Some on the FA council claim there is one rule for a high-profile figure such as Elleray and another for those lower down the FA pyramid. The FA say no-one complained after the Elleray incident, so it was dealt with in-house, while a complainant in the Cummings case led to the setting up of a judiciary panel. The most likely outcome from Monday’s FIFA task force meeting on the dates of the Qatar 2022 World Cup is a recommendation for November and December. There is no chance of UEFA’s January-February preference winning acceptance after FIFA president Sepp Blatter and IOC president Thomas Bach agreed that the World Cup must not impact on the 2022 Winter Olympics. And a World Cup in April/May will not be much cooler than a June tournament. Sepp Blatter (right) is set to agree that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar should be played in November/December . Sky Sports are notorious for cheerleading over their key rights coverage — when does gushing host Ed Chamberlin ever admit to showing a really bad Premier League game? So it’s a worrying new development that the five-year extension to Sky’s England rugby autumn international series contract also includes a top-level sponsorship of the RFU. No surprises that Leeds’s trigger-happy owner Massimo Cellino took commercial advice from Matt Child, director of trading at Phones 4u, which went into administration with the feared loss of 2,400 jobs. Meanwhile, Cellino’s rash promise to Leeds fans that he would buy back Elland Road from Manchester property developer Jacob Adler for £15m has hit problems over raising a bank mortgage. Scalpel blunted by Cup . Chelsea, having appointed former Liverpool CEO Christian Purslow as their commercial chief, are expected to join Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal in following the Manchester United ‘scalpel’ approach of dividing up sponsorship opportunities around the world. But the United blueprint does not necessarily work for a national governing body — the FA are still looking for an FA Cup sponsor despite having brought in Phil Barker, former global sales manager at Old Trafford, at the start of the year to help apply United techniques to secure it. The FA are still looking for a sponsor for the FA Cup, which Arsenal won last season . In their fight against the secondary online ticket market, which is already offering Rugby World Cup seats at vastly inflated prices, England Rugby 2015 have produced a clever video apparently showing Jonny Wilkinson in familiar knees-bent, hands-clasped penalty kick pose. The figure turns out to be someone who can’t kick a rugby ball, with the message: ‘It’s not always easy to spot a fake.’ Accountants Deloitte, who have made their reputation in the sports industry with their annual football rich lists based on turnover — the financial reality is actually far more complex — are predicting a London NFL franchise would be worth £102m a year to the London economy.But that figure can only have been plucked out of the air when it is not known when or if London will field an NFL team.","David Elleray was given a slap on the wrist for his racist comment .

"The airline passenger who was stabbed in the mouth by a needle hidden in his turkey sandwich aboard a flight from Amsterdam has been put on a newly-approved anti-HIV drug in case the pin was laced with disease. James Tonges fears the needle could be part of a terrorist plot because others were found in a total of six sandwiches served to passengers aboard four Delta Airlines flights from the Dutch airport to the United States on Sunday. The FBI has launched an investigation and has interviewed each of the passengers who found the inch-long sewing needles. Delta has responded by serving only pre-packaged products on its flights. The vendor that made the sandwiches says it has increased its security in light of the incidents. Scroll down for video . Lurking in the turkey: Catering firm Gate Gourmet, which provides meals for 14 airlines including all long-haul British Airways flights from Heathrow, distributed six sandwiches that contained small sewing needles. They were found aboard six U.S.-bound flights out of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Sunday . Malice: James Tonges (left) was cut in the mouth by a needle in his sandwich. Dr Jack Drogt (right), who was on the same flight, also found a needle in his food. Dr Drogt said he believes they were put there deliberately by someone who meant to cause harm . Needle scare: Delta said sewing needles, like the ones seen here, were found in six sandwiches . Mr Tongues told ABC's Good Morning . America that he was two bites into the sandwich when he felt a sharp . pain in the roof of his mouth. 'I thought at first that it was a . toothpick, you know you have toothpicks in sandwiches sometimes that you . don't see. And when I pulled it out, I found a needle and it's about a . one-inch long needle,' he said. Two minutes later, Dr Jack Drogt, a . friend he had met earlier on the flight to Holland, notified a flight . attendant that he had found a needle, as well. Both men were flying business class from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Needles were also discovered on a second flight to Atlanta and another flight to Seattle. The FBI is currently testing the needles to determine whether they were contaminated. Mr Tonges said authorities put him on Truvada, a drug that was only recently approved to reduce the risk of contracting HIV. 'The important thing for me is, since . it did actually puncture the top of my mouth, I had to be put on . medication for that and we're waiting to see if there's any other type . of substance on the needles. They're doing their investigation right now . and they're going to let me know,' he told GMA. Gate Gourmet prepares over 200million meals a year from its 130 flight kitchens in 35 countries around the world. It services more than 20 airlines including Delta Air Lines, British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines, Qantas Airways, Air France, Emirates Airline,  Amtrak and EasyJet. The firm employs more than 22,000 people worldwide. In the UK, British Airways is Gate Gourmet's largest customer. In 2005, the caterer sacked 670 staff - mainly Asian women - from its airline meals service in a dispute over restructuring at Heathrow. It lost £25million at its operation at the airport the year before, and maintained that changes in working practices were needed. In August of that year, a two-day wildcat action by British Airways ground staff at Heathrow stopped all the airline's flights leaving the airport. The strike, in support of the Gate Gourmet workers, stranded more than 100,000 passengers and cost the airline an estimated £40million ($72million). It also left BA unable to provide normal in-flight meals once services resumed, with many passengers instead being given vouchers with which to buy their food from the airport. After the BA staff had returned to work, the stand-off at Gate Gourmet rumbled on, with the sacked staff picketing outside the caterer's Heathrow factory. To try to end the dispute, at the end of August Gate Gourmet offered all staff - including those that had been sacked - redundancy packages. About 700 staff - 300 of those sacked and 400 from the existing Gate Gourmet employees - applied to accept the offer . Dr Drogt said he fears the needles could be part of a terrorist plot. 'It was so deliberate... This was not . an incidental finding. The pins were identical. This all pointed . towards something which was deliberate and meant to harm,' he said. The . sandwiches were made in the Amsterdam kitchen of catering company Gate . Gourmet, and were to be served to business class passengers on Delta . flights out of Schiphol Airport. After the needles were found, passengers got pizza instead. Gate Gourmet spokeswoman Christina . Ulosevich said the company has gotten no reports of similar incidents on . any of the other airlines it serves out of Amsterdam. She said the company did not yet know how the needles got into the sandwiches. Gate . Gourmet issued a statement saying, 'We take this matter very seriously, . and we have launched our own full-scale investigation.' It also said it was 'heightening our already stringent safety and security procedures, to prevent any recurrence.' But she declined to comment further, saying 'details of this matter must remain confidential.' Delta says security has been increased in its food preparation process, and it is using more prepackaged food. In a statement to MailOnline, the airline said: 'Delta is taking this matter extremely seriously and is cooperating with local and federal authorities who are investigating the incident. The statement went on: 'Delta has taken immediate action with our in-flight caterer at Amsterdam to ensure the safety and quality of the food we provide onboard our aircraft. 'Delta requires all its in-flight caterers to adhere to strict criteria in order to offer our customers the very best onboard meals. The safety and security of our passengers and crew is Delta's number one priority.' The needle incident is the latest in a rash of troubles for the airline this month. Last week, a 'pressurization issue' forced a jet traveling from Detroit to Washington, D.C., to declare an emergency. Flight plan: All four flights with needles in their sandwiches were heading to the U.S. - including two to Atlanta . Dangerous: One passenger aboard a Delta plane was injured after biting into a sandwich containing a needle . The aircraft, carrying 152 passengers and six crew members, landed without incident and taxied to the gate. No injuries were reported. On Thursday night, a Delta flight from New York to Madrid was turned around shortly after take-off when a federal air marshal found suspicious wires in a rear lavatory. Although no explosives were found, officials discovered two pieces of a drinking straw about an inch and a half long with wires running through each. The matter is under investigation.","Needles found in sandwiches on four flights originating from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Sunday .

"One of Europe’s busiest airports was forced to shut down its new runway on Wednesday after a commercial aircraft carrying hundreds of people skidded off a taxiway. The KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight had just landed at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol from Nairobi, Kenya when it suddenly veered off course and came to a stop with its front wheels in the grass. There were no problems with the landing and no injuries were reported after the Boeing 747-400 went off track while taxiing to the terminal. Wrong direction: A KLM Royal Dutch Airlines plane veered off course while taxiing at Amsterdam's airport . Passenger Vincent Verweij, who posted photos of the plane on Twitter, said the flight crew informed passengers that the aircraft had suffered a problem with its brakes. He told RTL Nieuws that the plane came to a sudden stop around 6am but he didn’t realise there was a problem until the announcement from the cockpit. Vincent said passengers remained calm and they were stranded on the plane for around an hour until stairs and buses arrived to transport them to the terminal. Schiphol diverted flights to other runways for several hours until the plane was removed. The plane is being inspected by technicians and the cause of the incident remains under investigation.

"In a country boasting 10 Michelin-starred restaurants you would expect fierce competition to be crowned the nation's top eatery, but Americans have shunned them all in favour of a small food stand in Hawaii. With its menu written on a whiteboard and just two tables outside, Da Poke Shack in Kailua-Kona certainly doesn't seem like the sort of place to serve up culinary perfection. But it has been voted No.1 on Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat list - earning a five-star average from more than 600 reviews on the site. Seafood at Poke is fresh, savory, and a favorite destination for many foodies . Chefs prepare and price fresh fish daily for the restaurant's teeming fans . Da Poke Shack manager Keoki shows off one of their dishes . The restaurant averaged five stars from more than 600 reviews on Yelp . The combination of freshly caught fish seasoned and served as a traditional Hawaiin poke - meaning cubed, cut or sliced - has won rave reviews on the site. One user 'kaulana e' commented: 'Their poke bowl was so outta this world that it has ruined poke from any other place for me.' The Poke Bowl is a salad that contains greens . like seaweed or kimchi, Japanese spices, and raw ahi tuna fresh from the . sea. Dishes like the Poke Bowl go for only $8.00. Katie B from Chicago wrote: 'I've been back in Chicago for a week and I'm still dreaming of this place. I love poke [and] this was the freshest I've ever had. So many flavors, so many healthy sides...yum.' Daniel H from Belmont, California wrote: 'This . place started my infatuation with poke. Seriously folks, you can die . happy after filling yourself with the deliciousness served here.' It may look like an ordinary shack but diners give the tiny gem extraordinary reviews . The restaurant doesn't have a set price list and the cost of the menu changes on a daily basis depending on the availability of fresh fish .

"Standing just steps from the heavily armed border with North Korea, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said today that Pyongyang is closely watching the international response to Syria's use of chemical weapons against its own people. With North Korean soldiers eying his every move, Hagel told reporters that the U.S. has no plans to reduce its military presence in South Korea, despite the ongoing budget crisis. Hagel's visit is timed to the 60th anniversary of the signing of the mutual defense treaty between the U.S. and South Korea, and to reinforce America's commitment to the security of the peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (right) walks past South Korean soldiers with South Korea's Defence Minister Kim Kwan-jin (second left) in Panmunjom, South Korea today . Chuck Hagel speaks during a ceremony honoring the 60th anniversary of the U.S. alliance with South Korea today in Seoul . 'There is no margin for error up here,' Hagel said after a stop in one of the three small blue conference houses that sit on the border of North and South Korea. 'This is probably the only place in the world that we have always a risk of confrontation. Where the two sides are looking clearly and directly at each other all the time.' Inside the house, Hagel stepped briefly onto the North Korean side. And when he moved back outside to speak to a crowd of reporters, North Korean soldiers stepped up to the border just alongside the building and watched from about 40 feet away. Hagel said it's been pretty clear that North Korea, which also has a large stockpile of chemical weapons, has been monitoring the unfolding international effort to destroy Syria's chemical arsenal. Chuck Hagel stands for a toast to the U.S.-South Korean partnership, next to South Korean President Park Geun-hye (left) in Seoul today . South Korean soldiers stand guard inside a U.N. truce village building during a visit by members of the U.S. military with Chuck Hagel at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) And while he's not sure what message the North may take from the latest Syrian developments, U.S. officials suggest that the unanimous U.N. resolution could send a warning shot to Pyongyang. China, which has been North Korea's only major ally, and Russia both backed the U.N. resolution on Syria. And China has struck a more critical tone regarding North Korea in the past year, cooperating with the U.S. on tightening U.N. sanctions following Pyongyang's underground nuclear test in February. Other experts, however, caution that America's failure to follow through on its threats earlier this year to launch airstrikes into Syria to stop further use of chemical weapons there, could be interpreted by the North as a sign of weakness. 'If we had used force, I would guess that from North Korea's point of view that would be seen as potentially more threatening, because it would demonstrate a real willingness for the US to use force,' said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. There is the potential, she said, for other nations to conclude that, at the end of the day, 'the United States is just not as strong as it used to be.'

Chuck Hagel, left, listens to U.S. Army Col. James Minnich, as a North Korean soldier takes a photo through the winder on the border of the DMZ . Just 10 miles south of the North and South Korean border, however, U.S. and Korean troops went through a training exercise today as Hagel watched, all aimed at showing that the military is ready to respond if needed. At the Rodriguez Live Fire Complex, U.S. soldiers from the 2nd Infantry Division demonstrated an offensive maneuver with Apache helicopters, tanks and armored vehicles, filling the training ground with a haze of smoke and blasts from mortar fire. The exercise was part of the military certification for one of the U.S. platoons serving in South Korea. From there, Hagel went to Observation Post Ouellette, one of 77 guard posts that line the South Korean side of the border. He then stopped further down the road at Freedom House, where the blue conference buildings stand largely unused these days as a chill has once again settled over North and South Korean communications.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye, right,  toasts with U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in Seoul today . Since March, the North Koreas have refused to answer the routine phone calls from the South's side of the border. On Monday, however, Hagel and his staff attracted a bit of attention from the North as the group toured the South's border facilities. In addition to the ever-present North Korean guards standing both at the border and a bit further up the hill at their larger outpost, a small group of tourists also stopped to stare down at the group of Americans. According to officials, the tours come through as many as seven to 10 times a day. Hagel is expected to meet with South Korean officials over the next several days, including events and a parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the alliance as well as Armed Forces Day.

Troubled: A barricade in Kiev. Ukraine's opposition held a new rally today amid concern about military intervention in the country's worst crisis since independence . But some opposition leaders believed he was vanishing from the limelight in advance of imposing a state of emergency amid the deepest turmoil in Ukraine since the Orange Revolution in 2004-2005. 'Repression works in reverse. More people are coming to Maidan' Tamara Tribko, demonstrator . The protests, which are heading into a third month, began in late November after Mr Yanukovych backed away from a long-awaited agreement to deepen ties with the European Union. They quickly grew to encompass a wide range of grievances after police violently dispersed some of the early gatherings. During Mr Yanukovych’s sick leave, a sense of stasis set in and neither side showed signs of movement. But his return to work could bring new action.

Epicenter of Ukraine's unrest: An opposition supporter uses his mobile phone outside Independence Square . Food to eat: A woman distributes homemade cakes to opposition supporters guarding a barricade outside Kiev's Independence Square . ‘Repression works in reverse. More people are coming to Maidan,’ said demonstrator Tamara Tribko, using the abbreviated name of the square where an extensive tent camp has been established since early December. Top opposition figures spoke to the rally to urge supporters to push forward with their demands. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one of the protest leaders, emphasised the importance of obtaining the release of all people arrested during the protests. ‘We must free all,’ Mr Yatsenyuk said, adding that there were 116 people being held. ‘Freedom to every hero.’ Protection: A cordon of riot police face a barricade set up by anti-government protesters in central Kiev . Making their stand: An opposition supporter guards a barricade outside Kiev's Independence Square . In a line: Riot police officers take positions outside Kiev's Independence Square as the country's crisis deepens . Mr Yanukovych’s sick leave was announced the morning after the parliament voted to offer amnesty to many of those arrested during protests. 'We must free all. Freedom to every hero' Arseniy Yatsenyuk, protest leader . It was on the condition that demonstrators vacate some of the buildings they occupy in Kiev and government buildings elsewhere in the country. The measure was greeted with disdain by protesters, who characterised it as the Government essentially taking hostages and then using them to try to negotiate concessions. Kiev's city hall, which protesters have seized, is being used as an operations centre and dormitory key to supporting the extensive protester tent camp on the nearby Independence Square. Creativity: Anti-government protester Anna paints a hardhat at the Kiev City Hall, which has been occupied by opposition forces . Opposing sides Tents of anti-government protesters are pictured at Independence Square in Kiev . Another protest leader, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, showed that opposition hopes for cooperation from abroad are high. ‘The crisis will end at last when under the auspices of the international community we will hold new elections that will stop the regime of Yanukovych,’ he said. On Tuesday, parliament is expected to consider reforms to the constitution that would reduce some presidential powers and allot them to the prime minister. Mr Yanukovych last week accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, but has not appointed a new one.

Also today, authorities granted permission to a prominent opposition activist to leave Ukraine for treatment of injuries he sustained after allegedly being kidnapped and tortured. Dmytro Bulatov went missing on January 22 and resurfaced a week later, heavily bruised and with part of an ear cut off. The incident, along with the beatings of other activists, one of whom died, raised fears that government supporters are using brutal hirelings to intimidate the opposition. Police had sought Mr Bulatov for questioning on suspicion of organizing mass disorder, but prosecutors said he was free to go today. He was taken to an airport and Mr Klitschko said he would be flown to Latvia for treatment. Taking a break: An anti-government protester is pictured having a snack on Grushevsky Street in Kiev .

"Elegant in a pistachio and nude dress, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was every inch the royal style icon as she and husband King Willem-Alexander arrived in South Korea this morning. The visit comes after the North, led by Kim Jong Un, stepped up its sabre-rattling over the weekend following the launch of a refurbished Soviet nuclear submarine capable of striking Seoul. Despite the best efforts of dictator Mr Kim, the royal couple appeared undaunted and were welcomed by huge crowds waving Dutch and South Korean flags as they stepped off the plane. Scroll down for video . Not worried: King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima arrive in Seoul despite more threats from the North . Women at the top: Maxima (left) and Park Geun-Hye - South Korea's first female president . Warm welcome: The Dutch couple were met by crowds waving Dutch and South Korean flags . Pleased: Both halves of the Netherlands' royal couple looked delighted by their warm welcome . The Dutch royals are fresh from a successful visit to Japan, where they met Emperor Akhito and attended a trade conference. Formally welcomed by President Park Geun-Hye outside the striking Blue House presidential palace, the royals were all smiles as they, along with the South Korean president, met well-wishers lined up along the red carpet. Afterwards, they were taken inside where King Willem-Alexander held bilateral talks with the South Korean president ahead of a three-day tour of the country. Maxima and Willem-Alexander then travelled to the National Cemetery in the capital, which was established by presidential decree in 1956 - three years after the Korean War ended. The conflict, one of the first of the Cold War, saw British and US troops line up alongside the South Koreans, while the Soviet Empire slugged it out alongside Communist rebels in the north. Threats: North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has ramped up the belligerent rhetoric over the weekend . Talks: After the formal welcome, the royals and President Geun-Hye decamped to the Blue House for talks . All smiles: The Dutch royal couple looked thrilled to be in South Korea for a three-day tour . Signature: King Willem-Alexander signs the Blue House visitor's book, watched by Queen Maxima . Allies: King Willem-Alexander shakes hands with President Geun-Hye, watched by dignitaries from both nations . Common cause: Like the Japanese tour, the Dutch tour of South Korea is aimed at boosting trade . Eventually, the war, which ended in 1953, resulted in the partition of Korea with the North remaining communist while the South developed into a modern democracy. Only Korean veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars can be buried there, although the burial ground does have one foreign resident - Briton Francis William Schofield. During their visit to the cemetery, the couple met Korean War veteran Kwak Kyung-chan, with several others lining up to tell the couple of their experiences. Although a delegation from North Korea has visited the cemetery, relations between North and South Korea remain frosty with Mr Kim ramping up the belligerent rhetoric over the weekend. News of North Korea's latest attack submarine also came hot on the heels of photos released of unpredictable dictator Un visiting an air base, where he checked out equipment on a fighter jet and apparently ‘gave instructions’ to pilots. Tribute: Following the meeting with President Geun-Hye, the couple visited the National Cemetery . Remembrance: There, they paid tribute to the soldiers killed during the Korean War of the 1950s . Split: The war saw the UK and US line up with what is now South Korea against the communists of the north . Respectful: During their visit to the cemetery, the couple met with some of South Korea's war veterans . Honour: Only they can be buried in the National Cemetery, although there is one Briton buried there . According to local news agencies, Un then climbed into the cockpit of one of the pursuit aircraft and congratulated the pilots for their skills before promoting four squadron leaders on the spot. News of Kim’s visit prompted a South Korean source to remark that the North’s pilots have little experience in air battles and are ‘seized with fear’ at the thought of taking on Seoul’s airmen who have access to far superior technology. Whether Kim’s visit - his ninth to air force units this year - and the launching of the nuclear-capable submarine was just ‘sabre-rattling’ or a severe warning of troubles ahead was not immediately apparent. But the work on the 1958 Soviet vessel to bring it up to standards capable of putting to sea and possibly firing ballistic weapons is being watched carefully by South Korea’s military.","The Dutch royal couple have arrived in Seoul for a three-day visit .

"Like mother, like daughter, so the saying goes and Jane and Kristy Lowe are certainly proving it to be true. Thier family, from Sheffield, South Yourkshire, had suffered years of heartbreak but it seems their fortunes are finally changing after both mum and daughter landed modeling contracts on the same day. The pair were both signed by DK Model Management last month after a spell of bad luck, which included Jane, 47, having her skull smashed to pieces when she was hit by a bus. Jane Lowe, 47, was seriously injured by a bus in 2010 but is now a model and so is her daughter, Kristy, 20 . Kristy Lowe, 20, scooped a top modelling contract helping to end her family's run of awful luck . Since 2009, the pair from Sheffield, South Yorks, also endured a close family bereavement and discovered husband and dad Steve had throat cancer, causing nearly five years of misery for the family. Kristy, 20, said: 'It comes after a lot of bad luck, but we have come through it and everything has changed. 'It’s all a bit of a shock, and none of my friends can believe it. 'It just doesn’t happen to normal people, or so we thought. We always considered ourselves an unlucky family but we have survived and that is a great piece of luck.' After competing in the Miss South Yorkshire contest, Kristy, an interior design student at Northumbria University, scooped the award on February 14 at the Hilton hotel in Sheffield, following a series of grueling rounds. Then she was approached by DK Model Management, who offered her a modeling contract, despite having already unknowingly approached Jane earlier in the evening. Like mother, like daughter: Jane and Kirsty strike a pose together . Jane, a mortgage processor, said: “We couldn’t believe it when we realised we had both been asked. They had no idea we were related, I’d just been there to support Kristy. 'I’d never imagined doing anything like that before. They were looking for more mature models, and they asked me if I was interested. 'I’ve done shoots wearing office wear, casual, dressed up and gym wear, and there’s a chance Kristy and I could end up doing something together.' It's a big turnaround for Jane, who was hit by a First Mainline bus in March 2010 while crossing the road in Sheffield city centre. After being thrown 40 feet into the air and landing on the side of her head, doctors feared she would not survive, and she had to have a titanium plate fitted into the right hand side of her face. Jane said: “It was a single decker bus which knocked me down. It was a matter of seconds and I had the phone to my ear but I don’t remember anything else. 'I was looking to the left and I thought it was one-way so I didn’t see the bus, and the driver didn’t think to slow down. 'He’d only just set off and had only gone about 40 yards and he was travelling at around 40mph. 'The next thing I knew I was in hospital, and everything hurt.' During the accident, Jane’s front tooth punctured her lip and the bone in the whole left side of her face was smashed into thousands of tiny fragments. She was also left with a fractured pelvis and cheekbones, yet she suffered no internal injuries. She said: 'I looked like I’d had a stroke, and they had to completely rebuild the side of my face. 'Afterwards I couldn’t dress myself or bend at all and I had to have a wheelchair for the first few weeks. 'The work they did on my face is incredible. Even if you look at me close up, you can’t tell what I went through.' In 2010 Jane was crossing a road in Sheffield when she was hit by a bus. She had to have extensive work done to repair the bones in her head and face. Jane and Steve, a 47-year-old detective sergeant, went to the Miss South Yorkshire pageant to support Kristy during the final last month, along with sister Samantha, 17. After being scouted in a nightclub in Newcastle, she impressed judges at the final during the eco, fitness and ball-gown rounds. Kristy said: 'I was out on a night out with my friends when I was approached. It’s not the sort of thing I would usually do as I’m not a very confident person but I gave him my details and then got an email through a few days later. Kristy Lowe, 20, has already been crowned Miss South Yorkshire this year . 'I soon realised they focus on so much more than just looks, like being fit and healthy and having a personality. 'I was a bit skeptical at first but I have never met a nicer group of girls and we had so much fun. 'All of them were so nice and they were all screaming and shouting for me when I won. I never even expected to get to the final round and to win it was amazing.' Kristy has automatically secured herself a place in the Miss England contest in June, as well as looking forward to a part-time modeling career. She said: 'I can’t believe it. I now spend my weeks doing photo shoots! 'The whole thing has been a massive confidence booster for me, and I’ve really enjoyed it. I’m really looking forward to doing some modeling as I think it’s going to be a lot of fun.' DK Model Management is a commercial agency, which specialises in providing models of all ages for magazine and TV adverts, and promotes products rather than fashion. Kathy Holdsworth, managing director of DK Model Management, said: “I actually saw Jane before I saw Kristy because she was there on the evening of the Miss South Yorkshire final. 'She is very slim and attractive and she had a lovely dress on. 'I was one of the judges and the minute I saw Kristy I knew I wanted her to win, but you just don’t know what the others are thinking. I was delighted when she was announced as the winner. 'It was only when I saw Kristy with her parents that I realised they were related. The whole family are such delightful people and this could not have happened to a nicer family. 'I couldn’t believe that half of Jane’s face was made of titanium. It was hard to even see the tiny scars, the surgeon must have had incredible skill. 'When Kristy’s father told us of the terrible time the family have had, where they have suffered three blows in a row, I was so delighted that following all of this, the family now had a great reason to celebrate, and I had gained two lovely new models.' Better times: Mum Jane, 47 and daughter Kristy, 20, are now both models and hope they can work together.","Mother, Jane, 47 was hit by a bus in 2010 and had face reconstructed .

"The Quadrantid meteor shower is due overnight in the U.S. - and forecasters expect night owls could be treated to a spectacular display in the hours just before dawn, weather permitting. The waxing moon will stop sky watchers seeing too much until the hours after 3am local time in the East - but from then until dawn, meteors should be visible. Skywatchers on the West coast might be able to catch a less intense shower, again just before dawn. Quadrantid Meteor Shower pictured over Bow Valley, Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada in 2009: Although the shower is often spectacular, it's very brief - and many often miss the shower of up to 200 meteors per hour, which can be visible to the naked eye . The Quadrantid shower is one of the . year's most spectacular, but also the shower that most astronomers miss - . it's very brief and intense. Skywatchers on the East coast can expect to see between 50 and 100 meteors per hour. On the West, the shower will have begun to dwindle by the time the moon sets, so the rate of meteors will have slowed to between 25 and 50. Nasa says, 'Peaking in the wee morning hours, the Quadrantids have a maximum rate of about 100 per hour, varying between 60-200.' 'The waxing gibbous moon will set around 3 a.m. local time, leaving about two hours of excellent meteor observing before dawn. It's a good thing, too, because unlike the more famous Perseid and Geminid meteor showers, the Quadrantids only last a few hours -- it's the morning of January 4th, or nothing.'Like the Geminids, the Quadrantids originate from an asteroid, called 2003 EH1. Dynamical studies suggest that this body could very well be a piece of a comet which broke apart several centuries ago, and that the meteors you will see before dawn are the debris from this fragmentation. After hundreds of years orbiting the sun, they will enter our atmosphere at 90,000 mph, burning up 50 miles above Earth's surface.","Debris of asteroid collision to enter atmosphere before dawn U.S. time .

"Anne Mcintosh has been deselected from her safe seat . A senior Tory woman MP became the . first to be axed by the party for almost a decade last night after a . bitter deselection battle. Anne .

She is the fifth of the 49 Conservative women MPs who will not be standing for the party in 2015. In . an indication of the turmoil that has engulfed the Conservatives in . Thirsk and Malton, Miss McIntosh – who has been an MP since 1997 and . chairs the environment, food and rural affairs committee – claimed she . had been ousted by a ‘small cabal’. One . fellow Tory said Miss McIntosh, who used her Twitter account to issue . Biblical quotes apparently aimed at her detractors, was ‘a few peas . short of a casserole’. Another Conservative source said: ‘Anne has not helped herself. She is a menace.’ Earlier this week it was alleged that local Tory party officials conducted a dirty tricks campaign to oust Miss McIntosh. A . significant number of new members were co-opted on to the association’s . executive committee before a crucial vote last January to decide on the . MP’s future, it has been claimed. The . alleged irregularity has been called the Tory party’s ‘Falkirk moment’ – . a comparison to allegations of vote rigging over the selection of a . candidate in the Scottish constituency. Among . the names touted as potential replacements is Edward Legard, a . barrister and local councillor – and an old Etonian school friend of . David Cameron. Pollster Andrew Cooper, a Tory Party adviser and a . leading moderniser, expressed despair at the loss of another woman, . writing on Twitter: ‘Five down, 44 to go.’ Labour . frontbencher Jon Ashworth said it was a further blow to the Tories . following the departure of Louise Mensch and the announcement that Laura . Sandys, Lorraine Fullbrook and Jessica Lee will stand down in 2015. ‘What . on earth is the Conservative Party’s problem with women? With Anne . McIntosh deselected, the Tories look set to lose their only female MP in . the whole of Yorkshire and the Humber,’ he said. ‘David . Cameron has done nothing to stand up for one of his most senior women . MPs. His silence speaks volumes at a time when many people are asking . why the Conservative Party is so out of touch.’ Last night’s vote is highly unusual. Only four other MPs have been sacked by membership ballot in 25 years. Anxious wait: Miss McIntosh, pictured with fellow MP David Davies, has faced a deselection vote with the result announced on Friday . Miss .

"In the future, when your phone battery is running low, you could charge it using your sweat. Researchers have developed a small temporary tattoo that strips electrons from lactate produced by our bodies during perspiration. At the moment, the energy it harnesses is just enough to charge a small biobattery, but the team are working on ways to use the technology to charge smartphones and tablets. Scroll down for video . The patch (pictured) strips electrons from lactate, which is naturally produced in sweat. This is used to charge a small biobattery. Currently, the battery produces around 70 microWatts per square centimetre of skin, but the researchers are working on a way to harness more energy to charge phones or tablets . The device works by detecting and responding to lactate, which is naturally present in sweat. ‘Lactate is a very important indicator of how you are doing during exercise,’ said lead researcher Wenzhao Jia, Ph.D from the University of California San Diego. During strenuous physical activity, the body needs to generate more energy, so it activates a process called glycolysis. Glycolysis produces energy and lactate. Researchers imprinted a flexible lactate sensor onto temporary tattoo paper. The sensor contains an enzyme that strips electrons from lactate, generating a weak electrical current. This current can be used to power a sweat-powered biobattery. Batteries produce energy by passing current, in the form of electrons, from an anode to a cathode. In the case of the patch, the anode contains the enzyme that removes electrons from lactate, and the cathode contains a molecule that accepts the electrons. The maximum amount of energy produced by a person in the low-fitness group was 70 microWatts per square cm of skin. By comparison, a phone uses between two and six watts. There are 1,000,000 microWatts in a watt so the technology is still a way off from achieving that sort of power. In general, the more intense the exercise, the more lactate the body produces. During strenuous physical activity, the body needs to generate more energy, so it activates a process called glycolysis. Glycolysis produces energy and lactate, the latter of which scientists can detect in the blood. Professional athletes monitor their lactate levels during performance testing as a way to evaluate their fitness and training program. In addition, doctors measure lactate during exercise testing of patients for conditions marked by abnormally high lactate levels, such as heart or lung disease. Currently, lactate testing is inconvenient and intrusive because blood samples must be collected from the person at different times during the exercise regime and then analysed. Ms Jia, a postdoctoral student in the lab of Professor Joseph Wang, and her colleague imprinted a flexible lactate sensor onto temporary tattoo paper. The sensor contains an enzyme that strips electrons from lactate, generating a weak electrical current. The researchers applied the tattoo to the upper arms of 10 healthy volunteers. They then measured the electrical current produced as the volunteers exercised at increasing resistance levels for 30 minutes. During strenuous activity, the body needs to generate more energy, so it activates a process called glycolysis. Glycolysis creates energy and lactate. Researchers imprinted a flexible lactate sensor onto tattoo paper. The sensor (pictured) contains an enzyme that strips electrons from lactate, generating a weak electrical current . They could then continuously monitor sweat lactate levels over time, and with changes in exercise intensity. Ms Jia and her team then went a step further to build a sweat-powered biobattery. When 15 volunteers wore the tattoo biobatteries while exercising, they produced different amounts of power. Interestingly, people who were less fit, exercising fewer than once a week, produced more power than those who were moderately fit, exercising one to three times per week. Enthusiasts who worked out more than three times per week produced the least amount of power. Earlier this year, Motorola teamed up with California-based VivaInk to create a range of digital tattoos the size of a penny that stick to a person’s wrist, or other body part. By linking the circuits in the waterproof patch (pictured) to a phone, users can unlock devices simply by holding them near their wrist . The researchers said this is probably because the less-fit people became tired sooner, causing glycolysis to kick in earlier, forming more lactate. The maximum amount of energy produced was 70 microWatts per square cm of skin. By comparison, a phone uses between two and six watts. There are 1,000,000 microWatts in a watt so the technology is still a way off from achieving that sort of power. ‘The current produced is not that high, but we are working on enhancing it so that eventually we could power some small electronic devices,’ Ms Jia said. ‘So besides working to get higher power, we also need to leverage electronics to store the generated current and make it sufficient for these requirements.’ The team presented their findings at the National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS).","The patch works by detecting lactate, which is naturally found in sweat .

"When Piers Morgan asked Ed Miliband last year what he was like at school, the Labour leader hesitated, before answering timidly: ‘I used to be good at the Rubik’s Cube.’ He has been similarly reticent about his family, shielding wife Justine and their two young children, Daniel and Samuel, from the limelight. But, with a series of polls showing that his ratings lag behind those of his Party and the Tory determination to target him personally, Mr Miliband has decided to shrug off his natural shyness. Shrug off shyness: Ed Miliband, pictured with wife Justine and sons Samuel (left) and Daniel (right) has been reticent about his family in the past . A new film, dubbed Ed: The Movie by aides, attempts to highlight the human side of the self-confessed ‘geek’. The party political broadcast, to be screened nationwide on Wednesday, shows him and his wife playing with their children. And it highlights his school days at a tough North London comprehensive, with Mr Miliband, 42, recalling how he used to dodge scraps in the playground. Former classmates line up to praise his down-to-earth background, and say it will help him to be a good Prime Minister. 'Chatty': Mr Miliband, aged 12, in his Haverstock school days and he is a self-confessed 'geek' The Mail on Sunday has also obtained Mr Miliband’s school reports, which show despite his excellent results he was no teachers’ pet. He had to be separated from his pals because their noisy antics were disrupting the class. There is no mention in the broadcast of David Cameron’s progress from prep school to Eton or the Prime Minister’s Bullingdon Club days at Oxford. But the Labour message is clear: Ed is an ordinary guy, Dave isn’t. Miliband’s science teacher at Haverstock School in North London in 1983, Mr Ashby, said of Ed, then aged 13: ‘Edward has worked well. His main problem  is he can be very chatty and argumentative when he is with his friends. I have often had to separate them.’ German teacher Miss Tenbeitel says: ‘Reached high standard in most aspects. More care, however, is needed with homework.’ The young Ed studied textiles at Haverstock. Teacher Miss Linden wrote: ‘Edward produced a good design for weaving, which has developed into an excellent piece of work.’ Mr Fry the music teacher said: ‘He has produced some excellent pieces of work. He should consider studying an instrument.’ Nine-year-old Ed’s report from Desmond Fawcett, his teacher at Primrose Hill Primary School, says in July 1979: ‘Edward is regular and punctual in his attendance. He can produce good creative writing, but in drawing and painting he is very unconfident. ‘He can work on number work at a much higher level than most of the class. He has problems with his handwriting but there has been much improvement.’ No teacher's pet: The Mail On Sunday obtained Mr Miliband's school reports, among them his textiles report in which he is described as 'making very good progress' in year two . Former Haverstock classmate Socratis Socratous says in the Labour film: ‘I hung around with Ed from the age of about 12. When it came to maths, the way his brain worked was incredible. ‘He could look after himself in terms of getting out of tricky situations by using his brain. Anybody with Ed’s experience and background in that kind of school environment must be good for this country.’ A senior Labour source said: ‘We are not about making judgments on where anyone went to school, state or private. School days: In the party political broadcast to be screened nationwide on Wednesday, Mr Miliband's tough school days at Haverstock school, pictured, in north London . ‘This film is about letting people know where Ed Miliband comes from, the roots of his values and what drives him on. ‘Going to Haverstock Comprehensive in the Eighties was a big influence on Ed, as was his upbringing by his parents. ‘The more the public see of him, the more they like. ‘The same cannot be said about Cameron. His decision to target Ed with personal attacks and spurious polls shows he is  rattled. It is desperation masquerading as strategy.’ 'Comprehensive kid' Ed Miliband declares class war on Old Etonian Cameron . The political battle between David Cameron and Ed Miliband turned into a class war last night after the comprehensive-educated Labour leader targeted the Prime Minister’s Etonian background. A TV film dubbed Ed: The Movie by aides, in which he talks of his days at the tough Haverstock School in North London and life with his  children and wife Justine, is to be broadcast on Wednesday. The aim is to hit back hard at Mr Cameron’s decision to  target him personally as ‘Labour’s weakest link’ to halt the Tories’ slide in the polls. Mr Miliband has decided to ‘fight fire with fire’ by highlighting his state school background and immigrant family roots compared with privately educated Tories such as Mr Cameron and George Osborne. The political battle between David Cameron and Mr Miliband turned into a class war last night after the Labour leader targeted Cameron's Etonian background . Labour believes that the rant at No . 10 police by Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, who was educated at Rugby . School, has made the Conservatives even more vulnerable on this front. Details of the party political broadcast came as: . Mr Miliband’s decision to  ‘get personal’ with Mr Cameron is bound to be seen as high  risk. Labour claims the Tories’ attack on its leader is a ‘sign of desperation’ and shows they have ‘run out of ideas’. The Conservatives even paid for their own ‘anti-Ed’ poll that  confirmed previous surveys suggesting Mr Miliband does not impress voters. But Labour believes the Mitchell ‘plebgate’ row has focused attention on the Tories’ own weak spot: the privileged background of some Ministers. Conservative MP Nadine Dorries’s claim earlier this year that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne are ‘arrogant posh boys’ was seized on by Labour. Recalling his time at Haverstock School, the Labour leader says: ‘There were fights in  the playground. You learnt to  be streetwise and navigate  your way round. It felt like a tough school.’ The film also  features glowing tributes to  Mr Miliband by former classmates and teachers, and pupils who studied under him when he taught at Harvard University in the US. However, playing the class war card could backfire – Old Etonian Boris Johnson is the most popular senior politician. And when Labour activists in top hats were sent to target  privately educated Tory Edward Timpson in the Crewe and  Nantwich by-election in 2008, they scored a spectacular own goal: the Conservatives won their first by-election in more than a quarter of a century. l Labour’s plans for the NHS were thrown into confusion  last night after Mr Miliband appeared to suggest he would not repeal all the Coalition’s controversial health reforms. Challenged to say whether he would repeal the Act introducing the changes, the Labour leader said it would ‘not be  sensible for us to reverse it... and spend another £3billion on another top-down bureaucratic reorganisation’. Instead, he stressed he was looking for a new ‘legal basis’ for the NHS, based on ‘co-operation not competition’. But last night, a party spokesman insisted that Labour was committed to scrapping the Tories’ NHS reforms. ‘We will repeal the Bill,’ he said.","Ed Miliband aims to shrug off his natural shyness in a party broadcast .

"Unless you’re fortunate enough to be flying business class, airline meals are usually something to be endured rather than enjoyed. The food is often either soggy or dry, the choice is likely to be limited to a couple of dishes, and by the time the stewardess gets round to serving you, your preference may not even be available. Another grumble is that the meals are served up at times that may suit the crew but not you – so you may discover that lunch arrives at 11am and dinner at 5pm. Tired of airline food? Airport restaurants now offering takeaway options for the plane - called 'on-board picnics' You can take your own food, of course, and a sandwich and drink bought at the airport can save you a packet, especially on low-cost flights, which often charge punitive amounts for their in-flight catering. Heathrow has more interesting culinary options to take on to flights. Last month, it began offering ‘on-board picnics’ from the many restaurants across its five terminals. It claims it is the only airport in the world to provide this. Several of them will place items in their own cool bags at no extra charge to take aboard – and last week I sampled some of their offerings. Caviar House & Prunier Seafood Bar will prepare anything from its menu (apart from oysters) to take away in its slick, black cool bag. My very palatable smoked salmon and shrimps (£27) came on a plastic tray with slices of brown bread and a wedge of lemon, with three mini ice blocks to keep it all chilled. YO! Sushi at Heathrow offers 'plane Japanese food' meals, including platters of sashimi and nigiri sushi . From YO! Sushi, you can pick up its ‘plane Japanese food’ meals costing £15 or £17, in a fun container emblazoned ‘I am a cool bag’. With a decent-size platter of sashimi and nigiri sushi, a pot of fruit salad and a carton of coconut water, mine was reasonable value. Cheaper, single-item dishes are also available. My third offering was from Gordon Ramsay Plane Food. About 80 passengers a day are buying the restaurant’s three-course picnic meals costing £12.95. Mine included thin slithers of roast beef with a green salad, and a generously sized chocolate and pecan brownie. It was all rather good – especially as you end up with a Ramsay-branded cool bag. The picnic menu – see gordonramsay.com/planefood – offers a choice of dishes for each course and, like the others, can be pre-ordered. Heston Blumenthal's Perfectionists' Cafe will put its pizza in standard takeaway boxes upon request . The other restaurants I visited could all package food to take on to the plane, but most didn’t flag up the service and did not offer cool bags either. Nonetheless, some are definitely worth considering. For example, Heston Blumenthal’s Perfectionists’ Cafe will, on request, put its pizzas (from £9) in standard takeaway boxes. Though the pizza will be cold by the time you’re at 35,000 ft, in all likelihood it will taste a lot better than in-flight meals. Other points to note. Caviar House and YO! Sushi meals came with instructions to eat within two hours, so don’t wait to tuck in until you’re halfway to Hong Kong. In this respect, it strikes me that raw seafood is arguably the worst option for in-air picnic food. Cool bag: One of Gordon Ramsay’s Plane Food picnics, which can easily fit under your seat when you're done . The restaurants’ cool bags will easily fit in an overhead locker or under your seat, and are collapsible once empty. But when full, they are large – Caviar House’s measures 11in x 0.7in x 4in and is therefore too big to fit into most carry-on cases. Many airlines flying from Heathrow generally allow a compact second bag, but check if in doubt. If you don’t want a fancy meal, Heathrow has other options. The cheapest? A £3.79 meal deal from Boots for a sandwich, a bag of crisps and a drink.","Heathrow Airport restaurants now offering takeaway 'on-board picnics'

"Guilty: Aaron Ramsey, 35, was found guilty of severely injuring a child in the death of his son, Johnathan, pictured, in 2011 . A North Texas father has been convicted of slowly starving to death his 10-year-old son, slipping his body in a sleeping bag and dumping it in a rural area where it wasn't discovered for over a year. Aaron Ramsey, 35, was found guilty of severely injuring a child in the death of his son, Johnathan, after less than an hour of deliberations on Tuesday, and in just 20 minutes he was sentenced to life in prison by the Dallas County jury. Prosecutors said the father locked his son in his room, where he slowly starved on a diet of bread and water. They contend Ramsey dumped the child's emaciated body in a rural area south of Dallas in 2011. The boy's remains were found in the area a year ago in a creek.

"Mental evaluation: John Palowski, 31, allegedly ripped off a man's ear and bit off a bit his face . A New York man ripped off a man's ear and bit off part of his face in an unprovoked attack, said police . Police in the town of Evans, southwest of Buffalo, shocked John Palowski, 31, with a stun gun on Tuesday when they found two men wrestling on the front lawn of a home. Palowski was taken to Erie County Medical Center for a mental evaluation and he was charged with assault in the first degree - a Class-B felony - reckless endangerment 2nd degree and three counts of Harassment. A caretaker of one of the estates was working outside when Palowski aggressively approached him and attacked him, Evans Police Chief Ernest Masullo, told MailOnline. The caretaker managed to tackle Palowski to the ground and asked him, 'who are you?' and 'why are you doing this to me', he added. After some struggle, Palowski promised to stop fighting with the caretaker and said, 'OK. let me up,' vowing not to jump at him again. The very moment that the caretaker let the crazed man out of his control, Palowski viciously attacked him, ripping his ear away from his skull and biting off a piece of his face, Masullo claimed. The caretaker was rushed to an urgent care center and will undergo plastic surgery to fix the side of  his face that was damaged in the alleged assault. Palowski suffered from bruised ribs. 'Palowski is well known in the town of Evans,' Masullo told MailOnline. Palowski served six months in jail on a weapons charge in 2007 after he threatened Evans police officers with a loaded handgun after a high-speed chase. Police were able to take Palowski into custody and discovered a handmade grenade in his pocket, said Masullo. Police: Evans Police Chief Ernest Masullo told MailOnline that John Palowski is no stranger to Evans law enforcement and was convicted in 2007 for threatening police with a gun after a high speed car chase . 'The subject led the officers on a high speed chase which ended when the subject ran off the road. When the officers approached the vehicle, the subject had a loaded 357 magnum on his lap which he intended to use to shoot the officers,' said a police statement on the incident. 'He was convinced not to shoot the officers by his female passenger. When the officers removed him from the vehicle they also found that the subject had a homemade grenade on him. A subsequent search of the defendant’s vehicle and his residence officers found several other loaded handguns along with bomb making equipment'. Masullo told MailOnline that in 2007 Palowski took a plea deal that included co-operating with mental health professionals until his probation ended on March 2014. Between March and now Paloswski has not been under mental supervision, despite his history of mental illness. Masullo did not specify what type of mental problem Palowski suffers from but says he desperately needs treatment for his well-being and for the safety of Evans.","John Palowski allegedly ripped off a man's ear and bit off part of his face in an unprovoked attack on Tuesday .

"Air travel was once the last bastion of uncontactability in an increasingly connected world. But plane passengers are now embracing in-flight mobile phone technology more than ever before, according to new statistics. AeroMobile – the first mobile service ever to operate on a commercial flight – has revealed that more than 19 million passengers have successfully connected to the AeroMobile network since the service was introduced in 2008. AeroMobile – the first mobile service ever to operate on a commercial flight – has revealed 19 million passengers have successfully connected to the AeroMobile network since the service was introduced in 2008 . In those six years, more than 22 million text messages have been made and received on the AeroMobile network. The facility is now used on 260 aircraft across 13 airlines, meaning the service is available on more than 500 flights everyday. Figures are expected to rise heavily in the coming months with holidaymakers increasingly wanting to stay connected to friends and family while flying at 30,000ft. The AeroMobile service also allows passengers to send and upload messages and pictures to their social network accounts such as Twitter and Instagram, while travellers are now also able to send emails and post Whatsapp messages. ‘Many people don’t know that they can use their phones to send texts, make calls and connect to the internet inflight,’ said Kevin Rogers, CEO of AeroMobile. The facility is now used on 260 aircraft across 13 airlines, and is available on more than 500 flights everyday . ‘The AeroMobile service allows passengers to use their phone inflight with the same level of connectivity they experience on the ground. ‘Inflight mobile usage is becoming more and more popular – we are working with many airline partners including BA, Virgin Atlantic, Aer Lingus, Emirates, Lufthansa and Etihad – and more passengers than ever are using their mobile phones inflight,’ Rogers continued. In July 2014 the AeroMobile network was on-board more than 13,000 flights and available to 4.6 million passengers. The company say that a total of more than 500,000 MB of data has been transferred by passengers using its service since March 2008 – a huge amount when considering that an hour of video chatting on FaceTime uses 204MB. The company say that a total of more than 500,000 MB of data has been transferred by passengers using its service since March 2008 . Passengers using flights where the AeroMobile facility is available are automatically be connected to the network if they turn their phone on during the flight. Charges appear on mobile phone bills, just as they would when roaming abroad, so passengers are not required to on-board payments. Receiving a text message is free of charge. The 13 airlines currently offering inflight connectivity through AeroMobile are Emirates, Etihad Airways, KLM, Air France, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Transaero, SAS, Singapore Airlines, EVA Air, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Aer Lingus, as well as VIP Carriers Comlux, Dubai Air Wing and Presidential Flight. The AeroMobile service also allows passengers to send and upload messages and pictures to their social network accounts such as Twitter and Instagram, while travellers are now also able to send emails . It was in 2008 that mobile phones were first able to be used, with the system being unveiled on a flight from Dubai to London Heathrow. The Emirates Boeing 777 was equipped with the AeroMobile system, with one in five passengers on-board taking advantage of the facility. Costs are typically about £1.50 a minute. Phone calls in the air had previously been banned because of the fear that mobiles trying to connect with masts on the ground can interfere with the plane's controls. But the AeroMobile system used by planes lets phones connect to a minimast on the aircraft. Budget airline Ryanair trialled a similar service in 2009, but scrapped it later that year.","AeroMobile service now available on 260 aircraft across 13 airlines .

"Body image, bullying on social media, healthy eating, the destructive effects of the internet - these are all things at the foremost of any mother's mind as their daughter starts to grow up. And being a celebrity doesn't make it any easier  - as Denise Van Outen, mother to daughter Betsy, now four, is finding out. Whether it's how much time to allow a child to use an iPad, stopping your child from being bullied, or making sure they always feel good about their body, she is kept up at night worrying just as much as the next parent. Scroll down for video . Denise grew up in the seventies, without access to the web or diet fads. Since having her daughter Betsy, now four, she has become increasingly aware of how the world has changed in a generation, with the internet and body image both having a huge effect on the behaviour of young girls . One of the TV star's biggest concerns so far is how to keep her daughter unaware of the airbrushing, diet-crazed, size-zero world that young women are subjected to, for as long as possible. And one of her golden rules is never, ever talking about dieting or weight in front of Betsy. She said: 'My mum never talked about dieting in front of me and I get so cross when I see my friends do it in front of their kids. 'They don’t realise they’re doing it, but they’ll eat something and then I’ll see them say in front of their daughter or son, ""Oh, I shouldn’t have done that, I feel so fat now."" 'Kids pick up on that and they start to wonder if they will feel fat if they eat it, or whether they are fat. 'I didn’t even know what a diet was until I was into my late teens, which was great and I know that as a result, I have a really healthy attitude to eating. 'It's fine to talk about that kind of thing with your girlfriends, but never in front of their kids.' Since her early twenties, Denise has grown up in the spotlight. Denise, pictured here with Johnny Vaughn, has been in the public eye since she was 23 years old . After becoming famous as a presenter on one of the UK's most successful TV shows of the nineties - The Big Breakfast - the 40-year-old has rarely been out of the public eye. As a result, every aspect of her personal life been picked over in minute detail for the last 17 years. It means that unlike most women her age, she tries to keep away from social media as much as possible, apart from a Twitter account, which is largely for work purposes. It is an attitude that she is hoping will rub off on her daughter, especially in the age of online trolls, which has resulted in several British children taking their lives after being targeted by bullies on social networking sites. Denise said: 'You just have to try and monitor it as best you can. 'Educate the best you can from an early age about the dangers of what you can find on the internet, not to be trusting and just explain that the people on these sites are only a virtual friend. 'I had a very weird situation recently where I had a big group of girlfriends who I’ve known for years get together for my 40th birthday. Denise in 1997, when she was just 23 years old . 'It was funny because some of my mates who hardly know each other and have only met a couple of times were sitting there saying, “This is so weird being with you in person because I feel like I know everything about your life and yet I’ve probably met you twice in ten years.” 'These women are virtual friends. 'I’m not really in that world, I tweet but I’m not on Facebook, I’m so old school - I want to speak to my friends properly. 'I would much rather wait six weeks and have a phone call or go for a coffee than to get a virtual message every two weeks, because you need your friends and that proper support.' But the internet isn't the only technological concern, Denise also shares the worry of millions of parents across the western world about how much time their children are spending staring at screens. It's the daily dilemma of a busy single mum - how much can you allow your child to watch television or use an iPad, while also needing a tool to distract them as you get on with certain household chores. Denise said: 'You don’t want your kids to grow up too quickly, I have an iPad that has a lot of apps on it for my daughter and we spend a lot of time travelling in the car, so she uses it sometimes then. 'But I’m really quite strict about not spending too much time on the iPad, I play quite a lot of traditional games with her like 'I spy', or the first person to spot ten red cars can have a smartie. 'I’m really conscious of the fact that when I was younger I did a lot of travelling in the car with my parents and I was always encouraged to use my imagination a lot. 'I also think that conversing is important, it’s an easy way out for parents to sometimes just stick an iPhone or iPad in front of my kids. 'I do it, don’t get me wrong, by I limit the amount of time that I let her do it. 'But at the same time, you don’t want them to get left behind, because in schools, that is how they’re learning everything - on a touch screen.' A life for Betsy away from computers and televisions, running around outside with friends and playing on bikes - much like Denise's own childhood - is what spurred her to buy a family home in the Kentish countryside a few years ago. Denise at The Brit Awards in 2001 - she believes that a lot has changed in the showbiz industry since then . She said: 'I moved out of London for that reason. 'I grew up in Essex, it was quite built up and residential where I lived but my parents’ house looked over a field. 'We’d go out run around in the fields in our tracksuits and climb trees - that’s why I took my daughter out of London, I wanted her to have an outdoors upbringing. 'I love it when we just stick our wellies on and go and explore. 'I never had a sporty upbringing, partly because I went to theatre school, so my focus was on acting and singing. 'But I really hope Betsy gets involved in team sports. 'I’ve recently taken up golf and I take her to the putting green with me, I like it because it’s a social thing, it’s mixed sexes and it’s a nice thing to do that you can do in a group. 'It’s something that we can do as a mother and daughter, even on holiday, because we can go somewhere with a nice little golf course and play. 'If you can give your kids a focus, they’re not going to be as likely to focus on other things that might be worse for them. Denise Van Outen now presents her own radio show on Magic FM, something that she was much rarer in Britain even 15 years ago . 'That’s why I’m making a conscious effort to do these things with her, to try and get her involved in going to the local farm, trying horse riding, learning golf, to introduce her to all of these different interests.' And when she finally grows up,  Denise is hoping that her daughter may be the part of the first generation who no longer have to deal with the barriers that sexism brings. She said: 'You’d hope she will be the first generation not have sexism, but we don’t really know yet. 'I think that everything has become more equal, personally. 'I feel very blessed that I get to do a radio show on my own for Magic FM, for example - I think there was a time before when it almost always was a two-handed thing if there was a women presenter, or you’d be a sidekick. 'Now there are so many great female DJ’s out there.' Listen to Denise Van Outen on Magic FM every Saturday afternoon from 1-3pm.

"Physicist Paul Frampton is currently serving time in Bueno Aires after being found guilty of smuggling cocaine into the country . A brilliant physicist currently languishing under house arrest in Buenos Aries after being found guilty of smuggling two kilos of cocaine into the country has admitted his large ego played a key role in his tragic fall from grace. Paul Frampton, a distinguished professor of physics and astronomy, has spent most of the past 30 years as a professor at the University of North Carolina. But British-born Frampton’s life took a unexpected turn in November 2011 when he started an online relationship with someone he thought was Denise Milani, a Czech model and former Miss Bikini World. After meeting via an online dating . site and despite never having ever spoken to her, Frampton, 68, became . convinced that they would marry and start a family. The . unlikely scenario of a glamorous model falling for an aging academic . clearly has all the hallmarks of a honey trap, but to a lonely old man . who had got divorced three years earlier the relationship seemed very . real to Frampton. Academic . friends warned Frampton about what he was getting into, but as the . professor himself admits he rarely pays attention to the opinions of . others. ‘He told me to look her up on the internet,’ his old friend John Dixon told The New York Times. ‘I thought he was out of his mind, and I told . him that. ""You’re not talking to the real girl. Why would a young woman . like that be interested in an old guy like you?” But he really believed . that he had a pretty young woman who wanted to marry him.’ When The New York Times asked . Frampton what made him think that Milani was interested, he replied, . ‘Well, I have been accused of having a huge ego.’ Friends say Frampton was extremely inexperienced with women and could therefore have been easily duped by whoever was posing as Milani. He was already 50 when he married his wife Anne-Marie Frampton. The pair divorced in 2008 and remain friends, she has described him as a very good scientist, but with the emotional age of a 3-year-old. Stolen identity: Denise Milani, 36, is a Czech model and former Miss Bikini World . As Frampton's online relationship with Milani blossomed, she invited him to finally meet her in La Paz, Bolivia, where she was doing a photo shoot. When Frampton arrived in La Paz he was greeted with a message that his supposed girlfriend had had to leave for another photo shoot in Brussels, but she promised to send him a ticket. The couple keep regular online contact and eventually a ticket arrived to take him to Buenos Aires, with the promise that a ticket to Brussels would follow. Milani simply asked one favor of Frampton – that he bring her bag which she had mistakenly left in La Paz. Despite the mounting evidence that he was being set up as the victim of some scam, Frampton agreed to her request and once again refused to listen to the advice of his friends. While still in Bolivia, Frampton exchanged messages with his old friend John Dixon. Frampton was already 50 when he married his ex-wife Anne-Marie, she has described him as a very good scientist, but with the emotional age of a 3-year-old . ‘I said: “Well, inside that suitcase sewn into the lining will be cocaine. You’re in big trouble,” said Dixon recalling their conversation. Nine days after he arrived in Bolivia, Frampton met with a man who handed over Milani’s bag. Frampton had been expecting a designer label and was so surprised by the non-descript black suitcase with wheels he was handed instead. He was even more surprised to find that it was also empty. He wrote to Milani, but she quickly wrote back that it had great ‘sentimental value’ to her. The next day Frampton flew from La Paz to Buenos Aires, where he waited for another two days for his ticket to Europe to arrive. With no sign of a ticket to Europe and after being away from home for 15 days, Frampton decided it was time to return to North Carolina. But rather than leave the bag behind, he decided to take it with him. That way, he reasoned, Milani could come and collect it from him. Then just as his friends had warned, Frampton was arrested when he checked the bag in at the airport and he was charged with transporting two kilos of cocaine into the country. Frampton spent almost a year at the Devoto prison sharing a large room with 40 other men accused of drug-related offenses . The professor was taken to Devoto, a dilapidated old prison where he was forced to share one large room with 80 other men accused of drug dealing or smuggling. Frampton admits it was a month into his prison stay before his fellow prisoners managed to convince him that the woman he thought he’d been in touch with all this time had probably been a man impersonating her. Throughout his 282 day stay in the prison, Frampton maintained that he was the victim of a scam. Three weeks before his trial and with the help of privately hired lawyers, Frampton was able to quickly secure his release on the proviso that he remained under house arrest at the Buenos Aires home of his friend Richard Czerniawski. At the trial the strategy of his defense team was to present Frampton as a brilliant man out of touch with day-to-day life. They claimed he suffered from 'a schizoid personality disorder that prevents him from . making normal social connections and renders him unusually gullible.' They called in a psychologist, who pronounced him unusually gullible without, however, diagnosing a mental illness. The judges sent their own doctor, who declared Frampton normal. Frampton was arrested at Ezeiza international airport in Buenos Aires . A total of three psychological evaluations were presented at the trial, and two agreed that he had the traits of a narcissistic personality - an overblown and unrealistic image of himself. Prior to the trial Frampton had maintained that his text message exchanges with the person he thought was Milani would prove his innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt. But that defense quickly unraveled. The prosecutor opened his cross-examination of Frampton by citing a text message retrieved from Frampton’s confiscated cellphone. ‘On Jan. 22 at 9:46 a.m.,’ he said, ‘you wrote from Ezeiza airport to the person you understood to be Denise Milani: “Was worried only about sniffer dogs but more.’” Other text exchanges also seemed to show Frampton had known more than he been letting on. One at 9:52 a.m. read: ‘Need to know if your loyalty is with the bad guy-agent & bolivian friends - or good guy, your husband?’ At 12:16 p.m., he wrote: 'WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME? AT THIS LAST MOMENT. WE DID NOT DECIDE HOW TO MEET TOMORROW IN BRUSSELS AND KEEP COCA & LIVES. AT SIRU (the hotel in Brussels where they were due to meet) WE MAY LOSE BOTH!!' Denise Milani had her identity stolen and used as the honey trap for Frampton . Frampton tried to explain to the judges that these messages – some 30 of them - were actually jokes. But perhaps they were the work of a fantasist living out a supposed alternative reality with a girlfriend who by ow even he by must have questioned the existence off? Even more oddly, his defense showed CC-TV footage which showed Frampton getting up from a cafe table and wandering off, leaving his bags unattended for up to 25 minutes at a time. Hardly the behavior of a drug smuggler. The prosecution then produced a piece of paper on which Frampton had written: ‘1 gram 200 dollars 2,000 grams 400,000 dollars.’ Although his defense claimed this had been written after he was arrested and Frampton simply enjoyed making random calculations. Frampton said: 'My mind works in a strange way.' Paul Frampton has spent most of the past 30 years as a professor at the University of North Carolina . Ultimately the judges sentenced him to four years eights months for drug smuggling on Nov. 19, although he is permitted to serve the remainder of sentence under house arrest in Buenos Aires. With credit for the time he has already spent in custody, Frampton is expected to be released in May 2014. Frampton maintains his innocence, but the truth of this bizarre set of circumstances may never be fully explained. The real Denise Milani was never accused of having a role in the drug smuggling and has no connection to Frampton. She told the Mail on Sunday that she feels sorry for Frampton. 'I have a lot of . sympathy for him, though I have to wonder how he could have been so . naive,' she said. He too says he has sympathy for her, but Frampton also has his own worries, in particular related to his finances. His university have kept his position open awaiting the outcome of an appeal he has launched. In the meantime he isn't being paid and friends have setup a website to help raise money for him and publicize his unusual experience.","Paul Frampton is a distinguished professor of physics and astronomy .

"These are the pictures that estate agents hope will entice a - suitably wealthy - buyer who perhaps wants to get away from it all. For those tempted by the the isolated home, which stands on . its own island off the Scottish coast, will need deep pockets, as 'King's Island' has gone on sale for a . cool £3million. The 260-acre island sits just 350 yards from the coast of west . Scotland, and has its own helicopter pad next to the remote . four-bedrooms house which has pride of place on the isolated isle. This boat jetty looking out on to Loch Craignish is one of very few man-made parts of the isle . Ample space: The four bedroom property on the island has extensive garden and driveway space due to its unique location . Although requiring access by boat or helicopter, the 260-acre island is a haven for many forms of wildlife . As well as the four-bedroom house, the island off Loch Craignish comes . with a boat house, observatory for gazing at the Northern Lights, and . its own helicopter facility. While King's Island may be the ideal hideaway for a James Bond villain, . its abundance of wildlife makes it a perfect purchase for a nature . lover. It is frequently visited by a population of deer that swim over from the . mainland and the sheltered waters also attract dolphins, otters, sea . eagles and ospreys. There is an endless supply of salmon and lobsters that the new owner can exclusively fish for. The island is currently owned by top City trader Christian Siva-Jothy, a . former partner in Goldman Sachs, who has modernised the main house. Room with a view: The owner of the island can look forward to seeing salmon, lobster and other forms of wildife in and around its shores . Spacious: The island also comes with its own boathouse and observatory . He closed down the $200million . business he began after leaving Goldman Sachs and made a stunning . confession about his ability to play the market. Mr Siva-Jothy wrote to investors in his firm SemperMacro: 'In this business, you are only as good as your last few trades. 'Mine have not been very good. Whether I have lost my edge or simply need a break after 23 years, I am . not sure. I certainly hope it’s the latter.' It is thought his financial misfortune has forced him to sell up. Previous owners have included Sir Reginald Johnston, a retired tutor to . Puyi, the last Chinese emperor, in the 1930s and then a retired Indian . army officer. Ran Morgan, from the estate agents, said: 'The island is stunningly . beautiful and surrounded by the most extraordinary land and seascapes. Isolated: King's Island sits 350 yards from the mainland of west Scotland . Remote: The four bedroom house on the island provides spectacular views, but little neighbourly contact . 'It is so peaceful and tranquil yet it only takes 10 minutes to travel . by boat to reach the mainland or 25 minutes to fly by helicopter to . Glasgow. 'The coastal village of Ardfern is the nearest settlement and has a large marina, supermarket and a thriving school. 'The wildlife is also quite incredible and while the salmon farm just a . few yards off the island is privately owned there is nothing to stop you . from dropping a rod and line into the water. 'The loch is sheltered and is also a wonderful place for water sports like kayaking and diving. 'This is a fantastic opportunity for someone to live a bit of a Robinson Crusoe-type existence and be at one with nature.'","King's Island sits 350 yards from Scottish mainland .

Taxi driver Richard Evans, who had been posting secret reviews of his passengers online rating how generous they were with their tip . Taxi driver Richard Evans snapped these secret pictures of his passengers and posted them on Twitter along with a review based on if they left a tip . But the 44-year-old has been slammed by other drivers because he is so scathing about the passengers who only pay the standard fare. In one of the reviews, which he shared with his 1,800 followers on Twitter he wrote: 'No tip - tight a***' while in another he described as another passenger as 'Shrek' due to his bulky appearance. In another he praises one of his passengers saying: '50p tip, keep the change, nice guy.' The tweets, which were shared with other taxi drivers in the town have now been deleted. Posting this picture of one of his passengers online, he wrote the caption, '50p tip #keepthechange nice lady . In his online reviews he wrote about the female passenger, left saying, '50p tip #keepthechange' and for the male fare right he said: 'keepthechange niceguy' But some have called for him to be barred from picking up passengers in his white seven-set Renault Scenic. Llanelli councillor John Jenkins said: “It sounds like it has quite a disturbing side to it. 'I’m pretty sure the licensing department would take a very dim view of it.'

"Jose Mourinho had his Chelsea stars training under the lights as they look to maintain their unbeaten start to the season at Newcastle on Saturday. The novel approach could be seen by the Blues boss as a tactic to keep his players on their toes as they've dispatched all that's before them after 14 Premier League games of the season so far. Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba, fresh from their goalscoring exploits against Tottenham on Wednesday night, both took in the club's session at their Cobham base.

The return of Costa means Didier Drogba is likely to return to the bench against Newcastle . In Costa's absence, the veteran striker found himself on the scoresheet in their 3-0 win against Spurs . Despite his strike against Spurs, Drogba is likely to lose who spot in the starting line-up to Diego Costa - who is available for selection following his one-match suspension. Mourinho will also be boosted by the news that Gary Cahill is fit to face the Magpies despite picking up a head knock against Spurs, while the Portuguese has a decision to make in midfield with Ramires and John Mikel Obi competing to replace the suspended Nemanja Matic. Ahead of the trip to Tyneside, Mourinho has heightened the pre-match build-up to the fixture by accusing their opponents of only playing to their potential when they face his side. The Portuguese has never won at St James' Park and insists that Alan Pardew's outfit are one of several teams which raise their game against the Blues. 'It's difficult, a difficult stadium to play at. There are a few stadiums in this country where, clearly, when they see the Chelsea shirts, they play the game of their lives,' he said at the Blues' pre-match press conference on Friday. 'When they play against other teams they look like they're playing friendlies. Maybe this is because Chelsea, in the last decade, became a strong team that everybody wants to beat.' Brazil international Willian (front) keeps the ball away from Jon Obi Mikel during the Blues' training session .

Mourinho also insists club records are the least of his concerns as he looks to guide his team to the Premier League title. Chelsea's 3-0 win against Tottenham on Wednesday night saw the Stamford Bridge club equal a club record 23-game unbeaten run. But Mourinho refused to praise himself or his team for achieving the feat while revealing the only record he's interested in is being the first Blues boss to win the Premier League three times. 'I don't care about it (unbeaten record). I'm not looking for records. I'm looking for points, victories and hopefully at the end of the season title,' he added. 'The only record I want is to win the Premier League three times in this club. That's the only thing that matter to me.'

The medals are not the official coins handed out in the Olympic ceremony, but special commemorative ones to be given out to the sportswomen and men who win on the anniversary of the meteor strike on February 15 . The meteor fireball meteor that blazed across southern Urals last February was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century. More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the . explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs, as it . landed near the city of Chelyabinsk. The . fireball measuring 18 meters across, screamed into Earth's atmosphere . at 41,600 mph. Much of the meteor landed in a local lake called . Chebarkul. The 600kg rock, believed to be one of the largest pieces of this meteorite, is currently being exhibited at the Chelyabinsk Regional History Museum in the Southern Urals.

Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact . Destruction: Officials later said that if an early warning system had been in place, Russia would have been able to prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris . Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes  and measured 55 feet in diameter . The chunk was recovered from the bottom of Chebarkul Lake, some 60km west of Chelyabinsk, following a recovery operation in October. Spanish . astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and . claim it came from the large Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses . passed Earth as it orbits the sun. They . added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused . by the gravitational pull of the planets and the sun, or could have been . caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit. The Chelyabinsk government said it had struck 50 medals, which will be unveiled on Monday, and ten would be issued to the athletes who win finals on the anniversary of the strike. The presentations will not be part of the official Olympic program.","Meteor is believed to be one of the largest pieces to be found .

"Almost 200 vintage travel posters from around the world went under the hammer on Tuesday night in New York, fetching winning bids totalling over $510,000 (£322,496). Featuring designs from Australia and Great Britain, the posters are a throwback to an age of travel where beach holidays were for the well-off, steam trains were the norm, and commercial aircraft had propellers. British seaside resorts featured heavily in the auction, as well as train routes, and many of the posters were placed at railway stations throughout the UK between the 1920s and 1940s. The painting of British seaside resort Felixstowe was sold for $5,500 (£3,370) Rail companies used the posters to beautify ticket offices and train platforms while advertising their routes - this design sold for a staggering $20,000 (£12,250) The posters were designed in the 1920s and 1930s for large railway companies that operated around the United Kingdom with the intention of filling seats on their trains . A holiday to the seaside gave an opportunity to family and friends to enjoy themselves . The London, Midlands and Scotland (LNS) London Necropolis Railway (LNR) poster, showing a night train en-route to Scotland with the slogan 'It's quicker by rail' fetched a staggering $20,000 (£12,250). One buyer was keen to get his hands on a poster for a holiday in Southport, painted by Fortunino Matania, shelling out almost $10,000 (£5,800) for the piece, which featured smiling faces of bikini-clad women around an outdoor swimming pool. A painting publicising beach time at Felixstowe went for $5,500 (£3,370), while a design for Blackpool, at a time where stag and hen parties were nowhere to be seen, went for $1,875 (£1,150). One advertising the famous Yorkshire resort of Scarborough features a demure couple picnicking on a hill overlooking the town's golden beach. Another, for nearby Bridlington, shows young couples sitting on a promenade wall enjoying a cigarette with a packed beach in the background. Beach holidays were a thing for the middle and upper classes back in 1930s Britain . Rail companies knew by using smiling faces and great scenes, it could tempt people to use their services . The rare posters are a throwback to a golden age of train travel when Britons’ family getaways were much simpler and staycations were the norm . Italian artist Fortunino Matania's 1926 poster showing adults relaxing near the seaside in Blackpool . The total amount of money raised from the sale of almost 200 iconic travel paintings was $500,000 (nearly £322,500) About 50 of the lots were Australian-themed travel posters either produced by railway and tourism bodies or shipping companies and airlines. Amazingly 48 of these were owned by one collector. The Australian collector in fact owned just under half of the lots put up for sale at the Swann Auction Galleries event. Nicholas Lowry, president of Swann Galleries, said: ‘These posters were designed in the 1920s and 1930s for the large railway companies that operated around the United Kingdom with the intention of filling seats on their trains. ‘They also wanted to beautify ticket offices and train platforms where most of these posters were intended to be displayed. ‘The posters bear striking, colourful and eye catching images from destinations which the different rail companies serviced. Some show lifestyle images giving visual snapshots of the way of life of the elegant people who vacation in those spots.' A major push for travel from England to Scotland made the rail companies commission posters to demonstrate how easy it was . The promotional posters fetched thousands of pounds when they were sold in the New York auction . With vertical and horizontal folds, this poster for Great Yarmouth and Gorleston on Sea went for $3,500 (£2,200) The collection also featured a number of Australian travel posters - not surprising since just under half of the entire lot was owned by a mystery Australian man . The Australian collector, as well as wanting to show off his own country, evidently had a penchant for Great Britain . He added: ‘I have never been to Scarborough nor Southport, but I can certainly imagine that even at the time these posters were created that the areas being promoted did not, in fact, look as glamorous in real life as they did in the posters. ‘Neither have I been to either Skegness or a British holiday camp, but I cannot imagine that such a parade-like, attractive, happy riot of humanity is what the average holidaymaker encountered upon their arrival there.’ He said: ‘It is without doubt the single best selection of British travel posters that have ever been offered for sale at any one time in terms of being the highest in quality and the rarest and most desirable.'","Poster advertising travel on a night train from London to Scotland sells for $20,000 (£12,250)

"Prime Minister David Cameron claimed a number of small amounts back from the taxpayer - including 38p for a staple remover . We have all heard of the £1,600 duck house, wide-screen TVs, moats cleared for £2,200 and many of the other extravagances that MPs put on their expenses. After the scandal was exposed and a new, tougher system was introduced to try to stop abuse, it was thought MPs would no longer be claiming repayment from taxpayers for risible items. But now, rather than submitting outrageously expensive claims, they are accused of squeezing every last penny out of the taxpayer by requesting repayment for the most mundane things. For example, David Cameron charged the public purse 7p for a bulldog clip and 38p for a staple remover. Apart from appearing petty, it also raises the issue of the cost of the bureaucracy involved and whether the PM and his staff ought not be better employed running the country rather than filling in forms to reclaim such piffling amounts. For Mr Cameron’s bulldog clip wouldn’t have made much of a dent in his estimated £4million fortune, and when you consider the cost of office time processing the claim, it will ultimately have landed taxpayers with a bill around four times the cost price. So, what other measly items of stationery have MPs claimed from the taxpayer in Westminster’s equivalent of Poundland? Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who recently pocketed £17  million from the sale of an educational resources company in which he had invested, claimed 5p in Parliamentary expenses for a paperclip. He also claimed 8p for a page marker and 41p for a black folder. Such expenses make former Solicitor-General and ex-Labour MP for Redcar Vera Baird look a spendthrift: she claimed 49p for ‘cable clips’ and 69p for a dustpan. Cameron also claimed a whole 7p bulldog clip . Another who evidently goes shopping for domestic wares in Poundland’s half-price sale at the taxpayers’ expense is John Barrett, Lib Dem MP for Edinburgh West, who claimed 49p for a doormat and 35p for a ballpoint pen. Maybe the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, the body charged with overhauling politicians’ pay and pensions in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal, would now frown on the 48p claimed by former Labour health secretary John Reid for a bottle of Morrisons’ toilet cleaner. But equally ludicrous claims still get through the system. Certainly, rules governing expenses have been tightened. MPs are no longer allowed to claim, for example, the cost of cleaning, gardening or buying furniture for their designated second home. However, it is still possible to submit claims for a wide variety of items such as TV bills, council tax, utility bills, travel and lunch costs for interns. Labour's Harriet Harman was repaid 10p for some drawing pins . Thus, Tory backbencher Penny Mordaunt, who earned £10,000 for her belly-flop appearance on the ITV show Splash!, giving the fee to a run-down lido in her constituency, was able to claim 90p in expenses for a trip to the very same lido — which is in the same road as her constituency office. She defended herself, saying: ‘The claim was for a staff member who used her car to make a visit to the lido as part of the support work we do with them . . . This was not a recreational visit and it is entirely reasonable that she be compensated.’ For three years, during the economic crisis, Labour’s Alistair Darling was in charge of the nation’s finances as Chancellor. But he managed to find time to concentrate on his own finances — claiming 70p for a postage stamp and 64p for a gluestick. Indeed, claims for stationery seem to be among the most petty. Pat McFadden, Labour MP for Wolverhampton South East, put in a claim for 19p for Blu-Tac adhesive, while Tory MP Julian Sturdy (York Outer) claimed 66p for ballpoint pens. Maybe he needed them to fill out his expense forms. Liam Byrne, Labour’s one-time Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is best known for leaving his Coalition successor a flippant note saying: ‘Sorry — there’s no money left.’ But clearly he thought that taxpayers’ munificence was not entirely exhausted, claiming back 46p for a set of Post-it notes. Taxpayers’ hard-earned money has also been used to repay 10p to Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman (who owns two homes) for some drawing pins, and 34p to buy Alan Johnson, Labour’s former Home Secretary, a pack of ten fold-back clips. Meanwhile, Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, claimed 18p on a mouse-mat for her computer. Not to be outdone, Sarah Teather, Lib Dem MP for Brent Central, claimed 17p for a pack of staples. All these claims involve work either at home or at the office, but MPs also cost us money when they go on the move. Rosie Cooper, Labour MP, claimed 29p for a packet of Hula Hoops and 30p for a jam doughnut . Former Tory Cabinet minister Liam Fox got into hot water for the cost of driving 100 yards from a cement firm to his constituency surgery. The sum was calculated at the 45p per mile rate which MPs can claim when using their own car on Parliamentary business. In the space of a year, Dr Fox made 15 travel claims for under £1. While other motorists complain of high parking charges, Sheryll Murray, Conservative MP for  South East Cornwall, has no such worries. On five occasions she claimed 20p for parking at her constituency surgery. Nick Harvey, Lib Dem MP for North Devon, has claimed the same amount for parking in his constituency. And Tristram Hunt, Labour MP for Stoke on Trent Central and Shadow Education Secretary, claimed 4p — the smallest possible amount for mileage — for ‘travel within own constituency’. It was a distance of just 176 yards. It’s not all car travel, though. Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York Central, claimed 40p for a two-mile bike ride around his constituency. ‘It’s not free to ride a bicycle,’ he protested when challenged. ‘They have to be maintained.’ Mr Darling was repaid 70p for a postage stamp and 64p for a gluestick while in charge of the nation's finances . After all that pedalling, it is little wonder that MPs get a bit peckish, and who would deny them a light snack? Rosie Cooper, Labour MP for West Lancashire, claimed 29p for a packet of Hula Hoops, 30p for a white chocolate cookie, 30p for a jam doughnut and 35p for a Bounty bar. Her high-calorie choice raised eyebrows, given that she has backed the British Heart Foundation’s campaign against hidden salt, fat and sugar in our diets. But she defended herself by arguing that she didn’t eat them — they were bought for an  unpaid intern. However, not all claims are approved. Mike Weatherley, Tory MP for Hove, saw his claim of 50p for a pint of milk rejected. Maybe it was the extra penny that made the difference because Adrian Sanders, MP for Torbay, was successful after submitting a claim for 49p for a pinta on expenses, as did Norman Baker, Lib Dem MP for Lewes. While Jeremy Wright, MP for Kenilworth, felt it was his right to claim back 99p for ‘office water’. Not surprisingly, such tiny claims often make front page news in MPs’ local newspapers. That’s why they are avid readers of the local press. Proof of this comes from the fact that Andrew Selous, Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire, claimed 75p for ‘purchase of Leighton Buzzard newspapers’, while Mike Pawsley, MP for Rugby, enjoyed reading the Rugby Advertiser at a cost of 65p  to taxpayers. Such petty claims surely belie MPs’ attempts to assure voters they have cleaned up their act. When tackled about the piddling amounts involved, many MPs (David Cameron was one) explained the claims were submitted by staff in their constituency office without their knowledge. Also, the reason the amounts were so small was that the system had changed so that individual items of stationery had to be listed rather than as part of a bulk order. With the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority scrutinising their claims as never before, some have complained at the bureaucracy involved in filling out their expense forms. What a shame, though, that a few more of them don’t seem to realise it would take up a lot less of their time if they were not so obsessed with claiming for every last doughnut and paperclip.","MPs accused today of squeezing every last penny out of taxpayer .

"On the pretty streets of his neighbourhood in Greenwich Village, New York, Philip Seymour Hoffman would play the perfect family man, delighting locals with his easy-going charm, approachable air and the loving relationship he clearly had with his three young children. They had given him a new sense of  purpose in life and taught him not to be so obsessive about his work, the famously dedicated actor liked to tell interviewers. In recent months, however, neighbours had noted a change for the worse in the Oscar-winner, widely regarded as one of the finest screen actors of his generation for his performances in films such as Capote, Doubt and The Master. One said he looked a ‘troubled soul’. Scroll down for video... Hoffman with costume designer Mimi O'Donnell and their son cooper in December . Hoffman seen walking with children Cooper, Willa and Tallulah on the way to school in April last year . People who ran into Hoffman at last month’s Sundance Film Festival in Utah had the same impression. He was there promoting his new movie, A Most Wanted Man. His usual scruffy appearance notwithstanding, he looked distinctly washed out and unwell. He turned down a string of interviews, his spokesman telling reporters ‘he needed a minute and didn’t feel like coming down yet’. Hoffman later agreed to talk on the proviso there were no personal questions. It was no secret he had struggled to stay free of the drugs he’d managed to give up 23 years ago - relapsing twice in the past two years. But friends insist they were convinced he had it under control, seeking help every time he thought his addictions were threatening to overwhelm him. It emerged yesterday that Hoffman had even helped other stars, including Batman star Heath Ledger — who was found dead in 2008 after an overdose of prescription drugs — to try to break free from heroin’s lethal appeal. But clearly not everyone knew that his  happy family unit had been broken and that he had recently become estranged from his children’s mother, costume designer and theatre director Mimi O’Donnell. They had been a couple since working on a play together in 1999, but Hoffman had quietly moved out of the family home around Christmas and was renting an apartment nearby. On Sunday morning, the 46-year-old actor failed to pick up their three children — Cooper, ten, Tallulah, seven, and five-year-old Willa — from a nearby playground, so Ms O’Donnell phoned Hoffman’s friend, screenwriter David Katz. Philip Seymour Hoffman sits in a bar in Atlanta just three days before he died . He in turn phoned Hoffman’s British personal assistant, Bella Wing-Davey, who unlocked the door to Hoffman’s £6,000-a-month flat and called emergency services. Ms O’Donnell was distraught when she heard the news. Bundling her children into her car, she drove to Hoffman’s flat, leaving them in the car outside with its engine running, as she dashed inside shouting: ‘I have to see him!’ Officers reportedly didn’t allow her into the bathroom where he had died. Police said yesterday that Ms O’Donnell told them that Hoffman appeared to be high when she saw him on the day before he died. He still sounded as if he was on drugs when she talked to him again on the phone at around 8pm. The autopsy and coroner’s report has yet to be released, but police are confident Hoffman died from a heroin overdose. Inside the fourth-floor apartment, investigators found the actor lying unconscious with a syringe stuck in his left arm. He was wearing just a T-shirt and boxer shorts. He still had on his glasses, said the police, who found no signs of a struggle. The flat contained compelling evidence of heavy drug-taking — there were no fewer than 49 full glassines, the paper envelopes used to store heroin, as well as 20 used needles. There were also eight empty envelopes, most of them stamped with the logos Ace of Spades or Ace of Hearts — dealers’ identifying marks showing the ‘brand’ of heroin. In the kitchen, there were bottles of prescription pills to treat anxiety and high blood pressure. Police did not find a suicide note, and are understood to believe the death was accidental. Did Hoffman start to fall back into drug use before or after he split from his long-term girlfriend? Showbusiness sources have suggested it may have been the reason for their separation. Hoffman was found dead of an apparent drug overdose in his apartment in the West Village in New York City . Hollywood insiders say Hoffman and O’Donnell had been a devoted but understated showbusiness couple. Intensely private, Hoffman, whose parents divorced when he was young, did not like to talk about his family. In a rare tribute to O’Donnell, he collected a Bafta for his role as Truman Capote in 2006 and said: ‘I want to say I love her and she looks really hot tonight.’ A few weeks later, he won an Oscar for the same role and forgot to mention her. Yesterday, friends said Hoffman and O’Donnell had been discreet about their break-up. ‘Whatever was going on, they kept it quiet,’ said Meg Gibson, a former colleague of Hoffman. ‘All I knew is that Phil was a devoted father. He saw the children every day.’ New York City Police Department investigators leave the actor's apartment following investigations . Police gather outside the actor's £6,000-a-month apartment on Sunday . Ms Gibson also rejected any suggestion that Hoffman might have been in a relationship with Bella Wing-Davey, saying: ‘There was nothing romantic between them. Phil was a mentor for Bella. She was learning her way in the business as a family friend.’ Ms O’Donnell and her children released a statement saying: ‘We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Phil and appreciate the outpouring of love and support we have received from everyone.’ For now, police are trying to establish what sort of heroin Hoffman was taking. There is speculation that the actor, who started using the drug as a student, may have inadvertently poisoned himself with heroin laced with fentanyl, a powerful opiate given to ease pain in cancer patients. This dangerous concoction has recently been found in packets stamped with the Ace of Spades logo, such as the ones discovered in Hoffman’s home. Heroin contaminated with fentanyl has been blamed for the recent deaths of almost 100 heroin users in the U.S. ‘We don’t yet know what killed Philip Seymour Hoffman, but we do know there is a batch of heroin going round which is laced with fentanyl,’ said Meghan Ralston of the Drug Police Alliance. Its victims ‘knew how much to inject, they knew how to be safe,’ she said. ‘You don’t realise this is a drug that is 100 times more potent than morphine.’ There were also reports yesterday that Hoffman may have been videotaped buying drugs the night before he died. He was seen looking ‘very sweaty’ as he withdrew large amounts of money from a local cash machine, which he handed to two men carrying messenger bags. To add to the picture of his chaotic state, a witness told yesterday how she had seen the actor in a bar in Atlanta, Georgia, last Thursday — drinking, smoking and repeatedly running to the lavatory to such an extent that she’d found it suspicious. Police have talked to Hoffman’s assistant Bella Wing-Davey, a pretty 28-year-old brunette. Philip Seymour Hoffman's personal assistant Isabella Wing-Davey who is thought to have found the actor dead . The Cambridge graduate and granddaughter of the late Anna Wing — matriarch Lou Beale in EastEnders — has known Hoffman for nearly 20 years. They met when Hoffman, then an unknown actor, appeared in a 1996 play directed by her father, Mark Wing-Davey. Best known in Britain for playing two-headed alien Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, Mark teaches drama at a New York college and has collaborated with Hoffman on several plays. ‘I’m not talking to folks right now about Phil,’ he said from his home in Greenwich Village. Friends of Hoffman had only just got over a hoax claim on the internet that he had died, which circulated just days before his actual death. Yet a handful of them have admitted they weren’t surprised by the news of his death. ‘Sadly, after being sober for years & years, he relapsed & has been grappling with his addiction for last few years,’ actress Kristen Johnson, a friend of Hoffman from college days, wrote on Twitter. ‘I wish I could say I was shocked, but all I feel is a mixture of terrible grief, sad resignation and a  powerful rage.’ The actor had said that he managed to stay off drugs for 23 years, until 2012, when he checked himself into rehab for snorting cocaine and taking prescription drugs. In May 2013, he relapsed again and spent ten days in rehab. Even worse, this time he admitted he had snorted heroin for a week. He credited a ‘great group of friends and family’ for helping him seek the treatment he needed to recover. But Hoffman was honest enough to admit there was no miracle cure, and that the threat of a relapse continually hung over him. Drug taking wasn’t simply ‘just a phase’ in his life, he confessed. Inevitably, living on his own deprived Hoffman of the constant companions who might have prevented his final relapse. Having a family, he had argued, encouraged him to look after himself. ‘When you have kids, health becomes more of a question than it ever did before,’ he said. ‘You are aware of the maintenance of your life, while before you weren’t so aware of that.’ The double tragedy of Hoffman’s death, it emerged yesterday, was that he had tried hard to save fellow star Heath Ledger and other celebrities from heroin. ‘Philip didn’t hesitate when Heath’s people asked for help getting him clean,’ a friend of Hoffman told an entertainment news website. ‘Philip spent hours talking to Heath, counselling and helping him, persuading him to choose life over drugs. ‘That’s what is so tragic about Phil’s death — he would spend all this time on others giving them reasons to stay away from drugs and to live, and yet when it came to himself it’s as if he was spent: there was nothing left.’","Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead in his apartment on Sunday .

"A mother whose two toddlers drowned in a backyard Californian swimming pool has been sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of child endangerment. Tassie Behrens, 28, said she woke up at just before 10am on May 13, 2013, and found her children, two-year-old Jason Bradford and his 16-month-old sister, Harley, in the pool, floating and unresponsive. Both children were taken to hospital but later died. The court heard how Behrens was under the influence of methamphetamine and her older child may have tried unsuccessfully to wake her up when he was unable to find his sister. Tassie Anne Behrens, 28, pleaded guilty in July to a pair of felony child endangerment charges. Her two toddlers drowned in a swimming pool at a friend's home near Mount Helix, California while she slept . In sentencing Behrens to prison, the judge said that the child victims were 'particularly vulnerable,' that the defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine when the accident happened, and that Behrens initially lied to police about where the accident took place . Court documents stated that the boy's clothes were found near the edge of the pool, suggesting that he jumped into the pool to save his sister. Behrens confirmed to investigators that  her son Jason woke her up at 8am that morning to ask for his sister, but she was so drugged-up she fell back to sleep. When she finally awoke, Behrens found both her children floating face down in the swimming pool at 9:45am. Her daughter, Harley, was pronounced dead just before 10.30am. Two-year-old Jason was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he died later that night. In denying Behrens probation, Judge Laura Halgren said the defendant did not plead guilty to causing the death of her children, but that she put them in a very dangerous situation by having them stay of the home of a friend, Larry Dangelo, where marijuana was being grown and wires were exposed. Prosecutors said a dismantled honey oil lab was downstairs in a garage. Harley and Jason Bradford (pictured) died in May 2013 after being found floating in a swimming pool of a Le Mesa, California, home . The children's mother, Tassie Anne Behrens, 26, was asleep when her two toddlers ended up in the pool . Fateful decision: Behrens (right) and a male friend decided to drive her dying kids to a fire station instead of a hospital because she was afraid to get the man in trouble . In sentencing Behrens to prison, Halgren said that the child victims were 'particularly vulnerable,' that the defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine when the accident happened, and that Behrens initially lied to police about where the accident took place . Her defense attorney Tom Carnessale -- arguing for probation -- told the judge that Behrens, a meth addict, was not happy with her children having to live in various homes and even thought about going to court and asking about foster care. Carnesale said the children were healthy and not abused. Stressed: Behrens wrote on her Facebook page about her struggles of raising two young children on her own . Tall tale: Behrens initially told police that the drownings occurred at a mobile park, but later admitted that it took place at the La Mesa home . In the weeks leading up to the tragedy, posts on Behren's Facebook page painted a portrait of a young woman who had been struggling with the responsibilities of raising two children on her own. 'This is so crazy chasing after 2 babies when I cannot even walk on my own,' she wrote. 'At least I can take cast on and off.If anyone feels like helping me by giving me a break from chasing kids around feel free to message me.lol' The despairing mom who was 26 at the time of the incident lamented that no one offered her a helping hand, and she has vowed to do 'absolutely everything' on her own. 'Its [sic]only me n[sic] my two babies. the loves of my life,' Behrens wrote. The  mother initially lied to officials by saying that the children were found in a pool in a Spring Valley mobile home park, but later admitted that they were discovered at the Le Mesa home. Larry Dangelo, 44, who lives at the Sunset Avenue residence along with another man, was later arrested on suspicion of running a marijuana-growing operation out of the basement at the house. At least 60 marijuana plants and drug-making equipment were seized by members of the regional Narcotics Task Force. A search of the home uncovered a marijuana-growing operation and the Narcotics Task Force was called in. Arrested: Larry D'Angelo was led away from his home in handcuffs after being questioned by police about the marijuana plants in his house . Stash: All of these marijuana plants were found in Larry D'Angelo's home and taken away by narcotics division .","Tassie Behrens, 28, was under the influence of drugs and was found to be in possession of marijuana .

"Parents were outraged after signs advertising Britain’s first tattoo parlour for children appeared in an empty shop window. The huge banner appeared at a small Whitstable art gallery advertising a business called ‘My First Tattoo’. It read: 'Coming soon: My First Tattoo. Britain’s first tattoo parlour for kids! 20% off your child’s first tattoo use code: ART' Parents were in uproar after signs advertising Britain's first tattoo parlour for children appeared in an empty shop window . Pictures in the shop window in Whitstable, Kent, show 14 different examples of cartoon tattoos, featuring Hello Kitty, Snoopy and the Powerpuff Girls. Featuring statements such as 'A gift for life, at pocket money prices', the poster understandably provoked shock and outrage in the seaside town. However, the sign was soon revealed as the work of local artist Sadie Hennessy, who wanted to provoke a debate about children growing up too quickly. Sadie says the purpose of her stunt was to provoke debate about children growing up too fast . She said: 'I’m not doing it to make a fool out of people I’m just trying to get people thinking about these issues about our children growing up too quickly. 'I was worried by children wearing t-shirts saying Future Porn Star and thongs for young girls and the shifting morality about what is acceptable for our kids. 'Children should be children for as long as they can be.' Sadie booked the shop window for two weeks and sparked concern among local parents. Resident Deborah Roberts tweeted: 'Surely this can’t be happening in Whitstable. It’s a joke, right?' While many residents have failed to see the funny side, Sadie reckons her social experiment is working, as she has already had some enquiries. She added: 'I’d say the response has been about 50/50 with people getting quite upset about the idea and lots of people have been asking if they can get their children tattooed. 'One man asked if it would hurt for his six-year-old daughter to get a tattoo. 'I knew it would be contentious but you can’t set out to provoke people without people getting provoked.'","Was in fact not a read ad, but the work of a local artist, Sadie Hennessy .

"Pressure: Ed Miliband is under pressure to re-open his investigation into alleged vote-rigging . Ed Miliband is under pressure to re-open his investigation into alleged vote-rigging after a cache of emails appeared to implicate Unite in thwarting the original inquiry. Around 1,000 emails handed over to police allegedly show union bosses conspiring to subvert the Labour Party investigation into the selection of its parliamentary candidate in Falkirk. Last night there were renewed calls – including one from Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont – to re-open the inquiry. Conservative MP Henry Smith has also written to police asking them to re-open their own investigation into the affair. The emails include messages from Stevie Deans, chairman of the Falkirk Labour Party, who is also a Unite boss at the Grangemouth oil refinery. Mr Deans was at the centre of the Grangemouth closure last week after Unite threatened strike action over his suspension from the firm. Employers Ineos suspected Mr Deans of spending company time on party business rather than industrial relations. The emails, published in the  Sunday Times, will embarrass Mr Miliband, who cleared Mr Deans of wrongdoing and reinstated him to the party in the autumn. Mr Miliband dropped the inquiry after four witnesses, members of a local family called Kane, withdrew their claims of vote-rigging. But the emails revealed that Mr . Deans himself had approved their retractions, which were drawn up by . lawyers acting on behalf of Unite. One . email sent by Howard Beckett, a Unite executive, said that the union . should draw up ‘statements on behalf of the Kanes rebutting allegations . in the report as to what they are alleged to have said’. Mr Deans wrote back that he was ‘happy’ with the draft adding: ‘Get this to the Kane family and get this posted tonight’. Unite has denied having any ‘inappropriate’ contact with witnesses and said it dealt with them through ‘external solicitors’. Another email also reveals a plot to try to drag former prime minister Gordon Brown into the affair by getting him to lobby Mr Miliband to drop his argument with Unite. Dispute: His suspension had previously triggered a dramatic stand-off, culminating in the shock closure of the petrochemical plant (pictured). This was only reversed at the 11th hour after the union backed down . Mr Beckett wrote: ‘We will prepare . for an approach to Gordon Brown wherein we ask Gordon to consider the . potential damage this could do and request GB do contact Ed M in . private.’ One email also appears to threaten . to launch a smear campaign, with an official saying: ‘Comms [the PR . team] will prepare the nasty stuff we know of individuals in the Labour . Party but this will not be used.’ Mr Miliband ordered an investigation into the selection process this summer following claims Unite had tried to pack the Falkirk West constituency with its own members to get Karie Murphy selected. Mr Miliband last night signalled he could re-open the investigation. A spokesman said: ‘Ed thinks if there is any new evidence, then he will be happy to examine it.’ The spokesman added that throughout Mr Miliband had acted swiftly to launch his initial inquiry. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: ‘If there is any new details that are as grave as is being suggested then of course there should be a new investigation.’ Henry Smith, Tory MP for Crawley, also wrote to police formally urging them to re-open their investigation over ‘potentially fraudulent behaviour’ by Unite. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Labour must re-open the Falkirk inquiry. Ed Miliband failed to stand up to the unions in Falkirk and backed down in the face of pressure from [Unite general  secretary] Len McCluskey.’ The local MP Eric Joyce, who is standing down at the next election following a drunken Commons brawl, joined calls for a new probe. He said: ‘Labour must re-open inquiry into Falkirk immediately. Local Labour members are outraged that Deans remains Falkirk West CLP [chairman].’ Unite said the claims against it over the selection process had been ‘entirely unjustified’ and neither the law nor the party rules had been broken -  claiming 'the email exchanges do nothing to change that'.","Labour leader under pressure to reopen vote-rigging investigation .

"Alberto Moreno admits his departure from Sevilla has been emotional and complicated but he is relishing the prospect of joining Liverpool. The 22-year-old arrived at the club's Melwood training ground on Wednesday to finalise a £12million move to Anfield after Sevilla relented in Liverpool's long pursuit for the left-back. The defender did not appear to train with his new team-mates, however, as they geared up for their opening game of the Premier League season against Southampton on Sunday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Moreno in tears after Super Cup ahead of Liverpool move . Passion: Alberto Moreno was in tears at the end of Sevilla's defeat to Real Madrid on Tuesday . Emotional: Alberto Moreno is consoled by his Sevilla team-mates at the end of Tuesday's game with Real . High flyer: Alberto Moreno (left) has impressed for Sevilla and Spain in the past season . Lazar Markovic - who has been suffering from a tendon problem - took part in training raising hopes that he may be fit for Sunday. New loan signing Javer Manquilllo also took part in the session at Melwood. Moreno, meanwhile, was pulled from Sevilla's starting line-up to face Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff on Tuesday night and bade a tearful farewell to fans and team-mates after the 2-0 defeat at the Millennium Stadium. 'I am living a strange situation because I'm leaving the club of my life,' Moreno told ABC de Sevilla. 'I was always aware of the two teams (trying) to agree (a deal). I never got into that but Sevilla have understood that Liverpool's offer was good and I am going. '(I have) many feelings together. What happened on the pitch, with the fans, will remain forever etched on me and I could not help but mourn (his departure) because I did not expect it. 'First came the parting with colleagues, then with the fans...all very complicated. Liverpool are a great team and of course I'm super-motivated. I hope things go well.' Moreno's arrival will be Liverpool's eighth summer signing, although Belgium striker Divock Origi has immediately returned to former club Lille on loan. Acquiring the defender, providing much-needed competition for Jose Enrique, will take manager Brendan Rodgers' spending past the £100m mark this summer.

The future of Denmark captain Daniel Agger remains in doubt now Rodgers has six centre-backs to choose from but for one of that group the way forward is clear. Trabzonspor were keen on veteran Kolo Toure but the Ivory Coast international intends to see out the final year of his Reds' contract. 'Trabzonspor are interested in me but I have expressed my pleasure at being a Liverpool player,' Toure told Sport-Ivoire.

'I had talks with the coach, who clearly indicated that I was part of his plans. I feel good physically and at 33 years of age I am ready for any challenge. 'I continue to work hard in training to keep up the momentum and it is why the coach wants to keep me at Liverpool, because I am a fighter.

I am very happy to wear the shirt of this legendary club. The situation can change at any time but for the moment I am at Liverpool and I want to carry on with the club.' At the other end of the scale Rodgers has been impressed by the progress made by 19-year-old Raheem Sterling, who has carried on the impressive performances of the previous campaign into Liverpool's pre-season games. 'Something we said to Raheem when he first broke into the team and we've reiterated is that you have to have an identity as a player,' Rodgers told liverpoolfc.com.

'When you look at the finish against Manchester City in New York, how many times have we seen [Lionel] Messi produce a touch like that, taking it through bodies when it's so tight in the box? 'The great thing with watching him now is that he gets you off your seat. When he gets the ball you think: ""Something could happen here"". 'He's taking it all in his stride and now he's in a good place with every part of his game. It's just about maintaining that commitment to his work.

CGF chief executive Mike Hooper said the follow-up examination backed up the initial finding of the doping control that Amalaha went through after her victory in the 52kg class at the Clyde Auditorium on July 25.

"Almost 50 years ago, Louise Jones was known as the New York City phone booth baby. And in many ways she continues to be. Dumped as a newborn in Manhattan's Upper West Side at about 5.30pm on July 17, 1965, she has learned nothing of her real family for the last 49 years. And that's not for the sake of trying. The one clue she had was a Catholic St. Jude medal pinned to the light blanket she was wrapped in. Now Jones is ramping up the search for her biological parents, enlisting the help of ABC's 20/20 program and renowned genealogist Pam Slaton. Searching for answers: Louise Jones, 49, the youngest woman to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, was dumped in a New York phone booth when she was two days old. She is now trying to find her family . Scene: Louise Jones was dumped in the photo booth on this corner, at 88th St. and Columbus Avenue, New York, on July 17, 1965. She knows nothing of her biological family . She was believed to be just two days old when she was left in the phone booth on the corner of 88th St. and Columbus Avenue. A group of people gathered around after noticing the little girl all by herself. She was in a diaper, rubber pants and the light blanket. Jones was picked up by a man, Pedro Martinez, who lived nearby, and taken to the 24th precinct police station. Within days she was adopted. Jones grew up in Staten Island, with a family she has previously as loving and affectionate, and only found out she was adopted when she was in her early 20s. She has been searching for answers ever since, but has not been able to come up with anything. According to The New York Post, she went on to have her own family and forge a successful career in finance. She was the youngest woman to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. But Jones longs to know the real story of where she came from. She wants to be able to track down her parents and find out why she was abandoned. To do that she has hired New Jersey-based Slaton, an adoptee herself who tracked down her own parents 10 years ago. Happy and successful: Jones grew up in a loving home and went on to have a family of her own and a powerful career, but longs to establish where she came from . Help: Pam Slaton is a genealogist and private investigator who helps adoptees find their parents. However she has so far not been able to help Louise Jones . Slaton has solved over 3,000 adoptions cases and operates on a 'no find, no fee' policy, where clients don't have to pay if she is unable to track down their families. So far she has been unable to help Jones. Even a DNA test failed to help the search. ABC's magazine program 20/20 is now investigating Jones' case and have asked for any tips to be sent through their website.

"Ed Miliband's leadership is in crisis today, as a new poll shows Labour has slumped to its worst rating since it had no-one in charge after its crushing 2010 election defeat. A new YouGov survey puts Labour on just 33 per cent, two points behind the Tories, and the lowest levels of support since the weeks after Gordon Brown quit after being ousted from Number 10. To add to Mr Miliband's woes, senior Labour figures rounded on his plans for a mansion tax, as Ed Balls mocked him for forgetting the deficit in his conference speech. Scroll down for video . The latest YouGov survey shows how just 33 per cent of people now say they will vote Labour, the lowest level since June 2010 . Ed Miliband has seen Labour's poll ratings tumble, amid reports of a leadership challenge and mounting criticism from party grandees . Mr Miliband suffered a disastrous Labour party conference two weeks ago, in which he forgot key passages from his speech which he attempted to memorise. He omitted any mention of the deficit and failed to refer to how he might tackle immigration to Britain. It was followed by a successful Conservative party conference, during which David Cameron garnered positive headlines for his promise of a tax cut for 30million workers. Reports have emerged of a plot to replace Mr Miliband with the more down-to-earth ex-postman Alan Johnson, while shadow health secretary Andy Burnham is said to be positioning as a leadership challenger. The latest in a series of YouGov studies putting the Conservatives ahead has Labour on only 33 per cent, the party's lowest figure with the pollster since June 2010, before Mr Miliband's election as leader. The poll for the Sun put the Tories on 35 per cent, Labour on 33 per cent, UKIP on 13 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 8 per cent. Mr Miliband has pinned his hopes of becoming Prime Minister on a promise of £2.5billion for the NHS, funded in part by a levy imposed on homes worth more than £2million. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls mocked Mr Miliband for forgetting to mention the deficit in his speech . However, there is growing criticism from within the Labour party about the mansion tax policy. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, told the Times it was 'too crude to work properly'. She said: 'I don't think it's the world's most sensible idea. We need to tackle the idea that people are shielding their money in London through properties. 'The problem identified is the right one; I just think the solution is too crude to work properly.' And former cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell told the newspaper: 'I am concerned about typically older families who are asset-rich and income-poor. 'They bought houses 40 years ago, which have appreciated enormously in value, and they certainly can't afford a mansion tax. 'The important thing is we set out how it will be applied and the fairness test that will apply.' One of Labour's biggest individual donors, JML founder John Mills, told the Huffington Post the mansion tax could push people into negative equity. 'The problem with the mansion tax - apart from issues of whether it's fair or going to work - is it requires really tricky valuations,' he said. 'It's a step from zero to some quite large number which is going to produce all sorts of problems on the boundary. 'If people have got mortgages, they could get into negative equity. There are these sort of problems as well.' The Tories and Lib Dems have repeatedly mocked Mr Miliband's failure to mention the deficit in his speech. Boris Johnson jokes last week: 'His subconscious rebelled. The baggage handlers in his memory went on strike – as they would under a Labour government – and refused to load the word deficit on to the conveyor belt of his tongue.' Senior Labour figures including Tessa Jowell (left) and Margaret Hodge have publicly criticised Mr Miliband's mansion tax plans . Now Mr Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, has joined the chorus of criticism, revealing he was 'surprised' that Mr Miliband had forgotten the economic section of his keynote conference speech. He told ITV1's The Agenda: 'Well I had seen the speech a couple of weeks ago so it's one of those things where sometimes in life you can forget the most important things. In that speech, not talking about the deficit.' He added: 'I knew what was in the speech and therefore I was surprised momentarily. I was surprised, but we are where we are. It's a really hard thing to stand up and make big speeches like that and do it from memory. 'I think if he could do the speech again it would be in. I think he was as annoyed by it as anybody would be.' It comes after the Labour leader was accused by party grandee Lord Prescott of showing a severe lack of ambition in a damning assessment of his 'far too timid' strategy and underwhelming conference performance. Prominent Labour donors also raised concerns over the weekend, with Lord Noon, one of the party's significant individual benefactors, saying the party 'really need to buck up' and Lord Levy, who was Tony Blair's chief fundraiser, criticising the tax plans as 'totally inappropriate'.","Labour down to just 33%, worst rating since June 2010 after Brown quit .

"Syria's bloody civil war has claimed more than 60,000 lives, the United Nations said yesterday. The report revealed a rising death toll in a struggle that shows no sign of ending. ‘The number of casualties is much higher than we expected and is truly shocking,’ said UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay. UN researchers used seven sources in five months of analysis to list at least 59,648 people killed in Syria between March 15, 2011 and November 30, 2012. A previous report late last year had put the death toll at 45,000. Scroll down for video . Injured: A wounded man at the site of a Syrian government airstrike on a gas station in the eastern Damascus suburb of Mleiha . Bloody attack: An amateur video posted online showed charred bodies and gruesome carnage at the scene of the gas station explosion . In each case, the victim's first and last name, the date and the location of their death were known. U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay said in a statement that . because the fighting continues 'we can assume that more than 60,000 . people have been killed by the beginning of 2013 . Meanwhile today a Syrian warplane blasted a gas station near Damascus, killing and wounding dozens of people and igniting a huge fire in what could be one of the bloodiest attacks in weeks during the 22-month civil war. Killed: Activists say dozens of people have been killed or wounded in an air raid on a gas station near the capital Damascus . Activists said a single Russian-built MiG fighter fired a missile that hit the gas station, setting off an inferno in the eastern suburb of Mleiha. Black smoke billowed from the site. An amateur video posted online showed charred bodies and gruesome carnage at the scene. Mohammed Saeed, an activist who visited the site, said the missile struck as drivers waited in line with their cars at the station. Syria has been facing a fuel crisis, and people often wait for hours to get gasoline. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human said ""tens of people were killed or wounded."" At least 10 bodies were seen in an amateur video. 'Many of the people who were there were killed,"" Saeed said via Skype. ""Body parts could be seen on the ground."" Fear: Free Syrian Army fighters run for cover at the front line near Menagh military airport in north Aleppo . He said the missile fired by the MiG warplane caused a crater a meter (three feet) deep. An amateur video showed several vehicles on fire and a cloud of smoke rising into the air. The videos appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting on the events depicted. It was unclear why the Syrian military targeted the gas station. There have been clashes and shelling in nearby areas in the past days. Saeed said there were two other air raids in the nearby suburbs of Maadamiyeh and Deir al-Asafir. 'Since yesterday the raids have been very intense,' Saeed said. In the north, rebels attacked a sprawling air base Wednesday as the opposition expanded its offensive on military airports in an attempt to sideline a major weapon in the hands of President Bashar Assad's forces. The Observatory said the rebel assault on the Taftanaz base was preceded by heavy shelling of the area, and the fighters appeared to be trying to storm the facility. Observatory director Rami Abdul-Rahman described the attack as one ""of the most intense"" on the airfield. Under attack: Smoke rises from buildings due to heavy shelling in Damascus countryside, Syria earlier today . In the past few weeks, Syrian rebels have stepped up their attacks on airports around the neighboring province of Aleppo, trying to chip away atthe government's air power, which poses the biggest obstacle to the opposition fighters' advances. As its control of large swaths of territory has slipped over the past year, the government has increasingly relied on its warplanes and helicopters to strike rebel-held areas. Several past rebel attempts to capture the Taftanaz base have failed. The Observatory said Syrian army helicopters were helping defend the airfield against the rebel assault. It said four rebels were killed in the clashes around the base, and one helicopter was hit by rebel fire. Tense times: A Free Syrian Army fighter stands on a vehicle as he holds his weapon in Taftanaz village, Idlib province, northern Syria . The Observatory said the rebels attacking Taftanaz base included members of Jabhat al-Nusra, affiliated with al-Qaida and branded a terrorist organization by the U.S. The group's fighters have been among the most effective on the rebel side in their battle to oust Assad. On Tuesday, clashes between government troops and rebels forced the international airport in Aleppo to stop all flights in and out of Syria's largest city. Rebels have been fighting for control of Aleppo since launching an offensive on the city over the summer. The fight over the commercial hub has turned into a bloody stalemate. Rebels have captured large swathes of territory in the surrounding Aleppo province west and north of the city up to the Turkish border. Pushing forward: The Observatory said the rebel assault on the Taftanaz base was preceded by heavy shelling of the area, and the fighters appeared to be trying to storm the facility . The rebels have been attacking three other airports in the Aleppo area, including the Mannagh military helicopter base near the Turkish border. They have posted dozens of videos online that appear to show fighters shooting mortars, homemade rockets and sniper rifles at targets inside the bases. The LCC said rebels Wednesday bombarded the Mannagh air base, which has been subjected to almost daily attacks since late last month. The Observatory also reported that eight shells struck the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk in the capital forcing some of the residents to flee the area that is mostly in the hands of rebels. Anti-regime activists say more than 45,000 people have been killed since the uprising against Assad began in March 2011. Since then, it has evolved into a full-scale civil war with scores of armed groups across the country fighting regime forces..","59,648 individuals killed between the start of the uprising on March 15, 2011, and Nov. 30, 2012, according to 'exhaustive' U.N study .

"She looks every inch the proud mother - but Rikje's pups are no common-or-garden litter. The 10 new arrivals are the first Stabyhouns to be born in the UK- and have at a stroke doubled the British population of one of the rarest dog breeds in the world. Before Rikje, 5, gave birth there were just seven Stabyhouns living here. Scroll down for video . Perfect pups: Rikje the Stabyhoun - one of the rarest breeds of dog in the world - gave birth to 10 pups in Britain, more than doubling the population in the UK . All told there are just 5,000 of the breed, making it one of the five rarest in the world. And strict breeding rules mean another litter will not be born in Britain until at least 2015. Her owner, Janice Vittachi, who moved to the UK from Canada two years ago, bought the rare dog in Denmark after finding out about the breed online. Ms Vittachi, who now lives in Teddington, Middlesex, took Rikje to Holland to be impregnated. She then helped her deliver three female and seven male puppies, which will sell for up to £950 each. Ms Vittachi said: ‘It all went very well although it seemed to take forever. She is doing quite well now. Count to 10: Stabyhoun owner Janice Vittachi holds two of the pups which can fetch £950 each. There are only 5,000 in the world . Pups-a-plenty: This is the first ever litter of Stabyhouns to be born in the UK and there will not be another until at least 2015 . ‘There is not much that I have to do . for them but I have spent most of my waking hours counting to 10. Every . now and then one will move off but mum does most of the work.’ The puppies' names have been inspired by . Friesland, the province in North Holland where the breed originates . from. The puppies’ names are Janneke, Kike, Laanke, Mork, Ninke, Ouke, . Pylgrim, Rembrandt, Sander, and Tynke. The Danish-born dog had her first litter of eight puppies in North America, where she lived previously, before coming to England in 2011. Her second litter have all been sold to families who will take home their new pets in November. Ms Vittachi launched the UK Stabyhoun Association with Christina Savage. International undertaking: Ms Vittachi bought Rikje in Denmark and had her impregnated in Holland before the dog gave birth in Teddington, Middlesex . Ms Savage said: ‘The arrival of the first ever British Stabyhoun litter is truly wonderful. ‘It marks a real milestone in our quest to establish a healthy and diverse population of this amazing breed in the UK. 'Behind the scenes, this litter has been almost a year in the planning as the central Dutch Stabyhoun Association sought out the most appropriate male based on extensive genetic background checks and health records. ‘The mating only went ahead when we were sure that there were loving homes waiting upon their arrival. ‘Those are the core principles of responsible breeding that we ask our members to subscribe to for the benefit of every single puppy and the breed as a whole. 'The UK Stabyhoun Association manages all sales and imports of Stabyhoun puppies in the UK and we operate a strict application process for these special dogs.

"Britain has the highest teen pregnancy rate in Western Europe, new figures showed today. Only Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia have a bigger problem with girls aged 15-19 giving birth, the Office for National Statistics said. Tackling high levels of teenage pregnancies is linked to the struggle to break the cycle of ill-health and poverty, the ONS said. Scroll down for video . The UK has one of the highest rates of pregnancies among 15-19-year-olds in Europe, the new figures from the Office for National Statistics show . According to the study into how European countries compare, the UK birth rate among women aged 15-19 was higher than the average across the whole of the 28 countries in the European Union. For every 1,000 women in the age bracket in the UK, there were 19.7 births, compared to only 12.6 births across the EU. The UK figure is significantly higher than other major European countries like Germany (8 births per 1,000), France (10.7) and Spain (9.1). Europe's lowest teenage birth rate was in Denmark (4.4), Slovenia (4.5) and the Netherlands (4.5). The long-term trend shows that teenage pregnancy rates are falling, and faster in countries where it is a bigger problem. The UK teenage birth rate is down by more than a quarter (26.8 per cent) since 2004 compared to a fall of almost one fifth (18.2 per cent) across the EU as a whole. A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Teenage pregnancy rates in the UK are now at their lowest level for over 40 years – but we need to keep up the momentum to achieve the levels seen by our Western European counterparts. 'We know that teenage pregnancy is strongly associated with our most deprived and socially excluded young people, and together with the NHS and local authorities we must continue to make progress.' While the teen pregnancy rate has fallen sharply in the UK, it is still much higher than the EU as a whole . Among countries outside the EU, Switzerland had the lowest birth rate with 3.4 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 in 2012. Azerbaijan, which borders Russia and Iran, had the highest rate at 50.0 births per thousand. In 2012, the birth rate among young women was 16.1 per 1,000 women aged 15-19 in Australia, 24.9 in New Zealand and 29.4 in the United States, the ONS said. The ONS said: 'There is a great deal of interest in teenage pregnancy levels in the UK and how these levels compare to other countries within Europe and the world. 'Globally, adolescent pregnancy and childbirth is regarded as a major contributor to maternal and child mortality and to the cycle of ill-health and poverty. 'This is largely as a result of the associated socio-economic factors before and after pregnancy as opposed to the biological effects of young maternal age.'","19.7 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 in the UK in 2012, study shows .

"Angry: John Kirby, pictured with his daughter Amelia, is demanding answers over the mysterious death of his pet dog Wilma . First it was the muffled crack of a gunshot and then the six ‘yelps’ that told the dog owner something was terribly wrong. Now property developer John Kirby is demanding answers from a luxury hotel after his beloved whippet was mistaken for a rabbit and shot dead on its golf course. Four-year-old Wilma was killed just yards from her owner’s garden. Mr Kirby, whose £400,000 house borders the Marriott Meon Valley Hotel and Country Club near Winchester, Hampshire, heard a ‘muffled crack’ before his pet ‘whimpered in pain’ and died. The hotel chain has suspended pest control at all its British resorts. The 45-year-old property developer, whose three-year-old grandson Alfie often plays in his garden, said he regularly sees gun-toting officials looking for rabbits in the dark on the golf course - apparently to stop them digging up the greens. He said: ‘I see pest controllers out on the golf course about once a month, on a buggy, and using lamps to look for rabbits. 'I also hear the occasional gun shot. However, on this occasion, I had no idea anybody was there until I heard the crack of a gunshot, followed by Wilma yelping and whimpering in pain.’ Mr Kirby, a divorcee and father to Amelia, 21 and Buddy, 22, had returned from walking Wilma when the devastating incident happened at around 9.15pm. He said: ‘We had returned from our walk, I sat in front of the TV with the patio doors open, and the dogs were wandering in and out.’ Wilma and his other dog Buffy, a 14-year-old Bedlington cross whippet, were in the garden, which is separated by bushes and shrubs from the 14th green and 15th tee of the 18-hole golf course. Then he heard a ‘muffled crack’. He said: ‘I knew instantly what it was and I shouted out “Wilma, Wilma” but only Buffy came back. All I could hear was six yelps.’ Man's best friend: John is snapped with four-year-old whippet Wilma . Shot dead:  Four-year-old whippet Wilma was killed, just yards from her owner's garden . Mr Kirby eventually found Wilma’s lifeless body, which had a gunshot wound and was covered in blood. He added: ‘She was lying dead and covered in blood beside a ditch - just a few metres from where I had been sitting. ‘A bullet had passed straight through her chest. The sight was sickening, and heartbreaking.’ He added: ‘I want to speak to the person who did it and just ask “why”? How could you mistake it for something else? ‘She was just a whippet and a really nice dog that was like a member of the family.’ Perpetrator: Wilma was shot by pest control hired by the Marriott Meon Valley Hotel and Country Club and was allegedly mistaken for a rabbit . Innocent victim: John Kirby's dog was out playing his his garden, and was found dead in the bushes to the right . A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said officers have spoken to a man in connection to the incident, but made no arrests. A . hotel spokesman said: ‘Meon Valley, a Marriott Hotel and Country Club, . is sad to confirm that an incident involving a pest controller and a . local pet dog was reported to the police during the night. ‘A full police investigation is under way and we have suspended all pest control at our UK hotels until this is complete. ‘We . are deeply sorry for the distress this unprecedented incident has . caused the dog’s owners and we will do all we can to assist the police . investigations.’ Meon Valley is a four-star hotel set in 225 wooded acres of rolling countryside on the edge of the South Downs. As . well as the 71-par 18-hole golf course, the £150-a-night hotel also . boasts a PGA-rated nine-hole course and a golf academy with a covered . driving range. There is also a heated indoor pool, fitness centre, . tennis courts and health spa. Distraught: John Kirby, pictured with his children Amelia and Buddy, who is holding his son Alfie, 3, and other dog Buffy, said his grandson often plays in the bushes where Wilma was shot . Responsible: Marriott hotels are investigation the death of Wilma, who was found shot in the chest . Demanding answers: Mr Kirby ,with his other dog Buffy, wants to know how pest control could mistake a whippet dog for something else . Mr Kirby, who has lived in the house for 40 years, said he had owned Wilma since she was an eight-week-old puppy. He said: ‘Wilma was the kindest, friendliest, most loyal pet you could imagine. She meant the world to me, my children, and grandson. ‘Returning from work I’d pull on to the driveway and see her head peering out of an upstairs window. ‘Her eyes would light up, and she’d come dashing down the stairs to welcome me in as I got to the front door.’ He said the golf club had complained about dogs running across the golf course a couple of years ago - but it was not aimed directly at him. The shooting happened at 9.15pm when it was ‘pitch black outside’ and nobody was playing on the course. He added: ‘I know the dogs should not be on the golf course and I am careful to keep an eye on them when they are in the garden. ‘They are often just messing around in the hedge on the border between our garden and the course. ‘As soon as I lose sight of them, I call them back. They are well-trained and not unruly.’","Wilma the dog was shot by pest control on luxury hotel's golf course .

"The White House has slammed the NFL over its recent spate of child and domestic abuse scandals, calling the revelations 'deeply troubling'. An official said in D.C. on Thursday that the football league must 'get a handle' on its widespread issues of violence and have a message of 'zero tolerance'. During a briefing on an awareness campaign about sexual assaults on college campuses, an official said the NFL had an 'obligation' to the U.S. and its millions of young fans to properly discipline those involved in abuse. Scroll down for video . Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer (left, and in his mugshot, right) is accused of beating up his wife, Kayla (left) for refusing to have sex with him and throwing a shoe at their young son (pictured) The White House official criticized the NFL during a briefing about the 'It's On Us' campaign, an initiative to fundamentally shift thinking about sexual assault and how to prevent it. Critics have been calling for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation over his handling of domestic abuses incidents involving Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Jonathan Dwyer. President Obama was shocked by the video showing Rice knocking out his then-fiancée, his chief of staff said earlier this month. 'The president was shocked by what he saw, let's put it that way,' Denis McDonough said. An official later added: '...like any American, (Obama) believes that domestic violence is contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society'. The White House's strong words came after another NFL player, Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer, was arrested on Wednesday. Police said he head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused to have sex with him, and punched her in the face the next day. The details surfaced in a police report a day after Dwyer was arrested on aggravated assault charges and deactivated from all team activities. He spent a night in jail and made a brief court appearance before being released early on Thursday. Dwyer, 25, was arrested over two incidents that occurred on July 21 and 22 at his Phoenix residence, just days before the Cardinals reported to training camp. The player denied  assault but acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to the police report. As he was released from jail on Thursday, he said he never hurt his son. He was ordered to wear an electronic tag and banned from contact with his wife. The Cardinals released a statement on Wednesday which said the team was 'aware of these allegations this afternoon when notified by Phoenix police and are cooperating fully. 'Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities.' Chris Rainey was cut from the Cardinals after being accused of slapping his girlfriend . The NFL said the case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. The Cardinals then released a second player accused of domestic violence. The team announced on Thursday that running back Chris Rainey had been released from its practice squad. Rainey was a fifth-round pick of the Steelers in 2012, but he was cut by the team after his rookie season when he was accused of slapping his girlfriend. He later pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct. Cardinals inside linebacker Daryl Washington also pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington has not yet been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator. Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved. Hardy was convicted of assault on a female and communicating threats after the victim said the 6-foot-4, 275-pound player threw her in the bathtub and onto a sofa covered with guns before threatening to kill her. Hardy is appealing the ruling. Critics have called for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation for his handling of Rice's case. Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his brutal attack on then-fiancée Janay in an Atlantic City casino elevator.","Spokesman for the administration said that the league must have 'zero tolerance' on domestic abuse after a spate of players' arrests .

"Peanuts: British workers face a bigger financial shock in retirement than their Continental cousins thanks to our proportionally low state pension . British workers face a bigger financial shock in retirement than their counterparts on the Continent thanks to our proportionally low state pension, a study has claimed. Research carried out by the think-tank International Longevity Centre UK (ILC) looked at how much elderly Britons get and how this compares to the income of workers. It found the figure paid here – £113.10 a week – is typically only one third of the average working person’s income after more than 40 years in the workforce. Proportionally, this makes it one of the least generous state pension schemes in Europe. As a result, people who retire without a private pension or any other form of nest egg receive a sudden financial shock, making it difficult to cover bills such as heat, light, food and transport. By comparison, the state pension in the rest of the EU works out at around half the national income. Some countries are even more generous, with the Italians getting 60 per cent of the average working wage. Workers in Greece currently get a figure equal to the working wage – although they do have a lower average working wage than the UK and their public finances are in greater disarray. The study also found that the UK has a greater number of pensioners at risk of poverty, 16 per cent, compared to a European average of 13 per cent. But the report concluded that the picture was not entirely gloomy for older people in the UK. It pointed out that the Winter Fuel Allowance has had a positive impact on pensioners’ quality of life – with only 3 per cent of old people here complaining about living in cold homes, compared to European average of 12 per cent, and a staggering 52 per cent of those in sunny Portugal. The ILC has argued for the scrapping of the traditional concept of retirement with efforts to encourage older people to remain in the workforce and earning money to cover their bills. To the workhouse with you old man! The International Longevity Centre UK, which carried out the research, has argued for older people to remain in the workforce and earning money to cover their bills . Helen Creighton, of the ILC UK, said: ‘Different countries have their own strengths and weaknesses. ‘While the UK has a good record on warm homes, thanks to the success of the Winter Fuel Allowance, Nordic countries have the best record on keeping older people in employment, which leads to higher incomes and fewer problems of social isolation. ‘The Government aspires for the UK to be the best place in the world to grow old. But while the UK is by no means the worst place in Europe to grow old, we’ ve got a lot to do to top the European league. ‘The Government is right to aspire to be the best. But to achieve that we must look at and learn lessons from our European colleagues.’ She added: ‘Europe’s ageing has profound implications for individuals, governments and businesses, and the UK must adapt to a Continent where it is projected that almost one in three people will be over the age of 65, and more than 1 in 10 will be over the age of 80 by 2060.’ Richard Willets, Director of Longevity at Partnership, which sells annuities to cover elderly care costs, said: ‘As with the UK, the rest of Europe is rapidly going grey. 'This raises a unique set of challenges for government, business and individuals who not only need to plan for their own later life but also need to put structures in place that will help society at large.’","The UK state pension is typically just a third of average working income .
In other countries it varies from 60 to 100 per cent of the average wage .

"Wealth: Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising giant WPP was the highest earning FTSE 100 executive last year, raking in £29.8million . Bosses as Britain's biggest companies saw their taxable pay soar by 15 per cent last year, bringing the average salary of a FTSE 100 chief executive to a staggering £4.72million. The increase, up from £4.1million in 2012, means it now takes the head of a top company just two days to earn £26,500 - the total amount the average British worker is paid in an entire year. The news comes as millions of Britons face hardship following years of pay freezes and pitiful rises below the rate of inflation, and further highlights the growing divide between the super-wealthy and those struggling to make ends meet. Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising giant WPP was the highest earning FTSE 100 executive last year, raking in £29.8million in just 12 months, according to a study by investor research company Manifest. His taxable remuneration package, which includes base pay, pensions and long-term bonuses cashed in 2013, was almost three times higher than any other company boss. In second place was Donald Robert of financial investment firm Experian with £10.1million, while Tidjane Thiam of life insurance and financial services multinational Prudential earned £8.6million. In fact Sorrell's record-breaking pay was so high that nearly 30 per cent of WPP shareholders refused to back the package at a meeting last year. The figures are based on the taxable income of FTSE chief executives, not their basic salary, as such a great deal of their remuneration comes in the form of bonuses and reward schemes. This way of measuring the data in known as Total Remuneration Received.

Robert Dudley (BP) - £7.95m . 9. António Horta-Osório (Lloyds) - £7.4m . 10. Dennis Bristow (Randgold Resouces) - £7.3m . Manifest says the 15 per cent rise in . executive pay is not surprising, as many receive bonuses in the form of . company shares linked to stock market performance, which has been strong . for FTSE companies over the past three years. When the figures are adjusted to strip out stock market performance related pay and leave only remuneration packages agreed in advance, the numbers are quite different. This data measure - known as Total Remuneration Awarded - suggests the average pay for a FTSE 100 executive actually fell by seven per cent last year, following a fall of five per cent in 2012. Despite this the research will make uncomfortable reading for campaigners who have long argued that executive pay is excessive. 'While it is clear that a combination of shareholder action and government regulation has helped to reduce chief executive pay [in terms of Total Remuneration Awarded], the figures in our survey will not end the public debate,' said Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Manifest.","Total pay for FTSE executives was up by average of £600,000 year-on-year .

"A farmer has launched an eleventh-hour appeal to stop his secretly built castle in Surrey from being demolished. Robert Fidler, 64, built the castle, complete with ramparts and cannon, on his land in Redhill, in 2001. But he initially concealed it under a 40ft-high stack of hay bales until eight years ago - by which time he believed he would be immune from planning rules. 'It's my home': Robert Fidler built the castle, Honeycrock Farmhouse, complete with ramparts and cannon in 2001 . Robert Fidler attempted to hide the castle behind 40ft-high stacks of hay bales after he began renovations in 2001 . But Reigate and Banstead Borough Council in Surrey refused him retrospective planning permission and a long-running battle began over his four-bed mock-Tudor home, Honeycrock Farmhouse. Now a planning inspector has begun hearing his latest appeal against refusal of planning consent. This time his claim relates to agricultural need as he and his wife Laura keep a herd of Sussex cattle at the farm and are using reason this to halt demolition. It is believed this could be the couple's last chance of saving their castle. The Reigate and Banstead Borough Council said Honeycrock Farmhouse does not abide by planning laws and wants it town down . Mr Fidler said: 'We have done nothing wrong. We have never broken any laws, contrary to what the authorities seem to be trying to suggest. 'All I have done is provided my family with a home to live in. 'For the few years before we did that, we were living in a shed in the corner of the yard.' Mr Fidler, who has been farming on his land at Salfords, Surrey for 40 years, was first ordered to demolish the castle in 2007. Castle luxury: Robert Fidler said he has not broken the law and just wanted to provide a house for his family to live in . Robert Fidler was given a 90-day demolition notice to tear down the castle in June after the council obtained a High Court injunction . He and his wife have lost a number of appeals to stop the bulldozers. In February this year, he submitted a new planning application to save the property on grounds of agricultural need. But this was refused by the council's planning committee on April 9. Then on June 13, the council obtained a High Court injunction requiring Mr Fidler to comply with four outstanding enforcement notices to demolish the house. He was given a 90-day demolition order, which the current hearing is concerned with. A spokesman for Reigate and Banstead Borough Council said: 'We will not be commenting on the case while it is going on.'","Robert Fidler, 64, built castle with ramparts and cannon in Redhill, Surrey, in 2001 without planning permission .

"A London garage located near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s home is set to become one of the most expensive places in the world to park after it was put up for sale for £500,000. The ‘substantial and secure’ garage - with a door measuring 8ft 5in wide and 9ft 2in high - is tucked away on Canning Place Mews, which is a 10-minute walk from Kensington Palace in Central London. Stretching back 17ft 9in, it is said to be large enough to accommodate a Bentley Continental or Range Rover - but is around £100,000 more than the average price of a home in London. Good location: The 'substantial and secure' garage - with a door measuring 8ft 5in wide and 9ft 2in high - is tucked away on Canning Place Mews, which is a 10-minute walk from Kensington Palace in Central London . Up for sale: It is being offered leasehold and only has 92 years left - with any buyer expected to pay a further £300 per year in ground rent and maintenance charges . The garage is also almost three times the £172,000 paid on average for a home in England and Wales last month. If the 279 sq ft lock-up sells for its asking price, it will work out at £1,792 per sq ft. For the same price as the garage, you could get a 28-bedroom country mansion in Devon, a picturesque cottage in the Cotswolds or an equestrian centre in Scotland. The 34,250 sq ft three-storey mansion in Devon, called Moreton House, also has 19 reception rooms, an impressive ballroom and eight bathrooms. Set in five acres, it has a wealth of period features and elegantly grand rooms - and is around 35 times the size of the average UK home. The stamp duty bill from a £7.1million purchase would be enough to buy the mansion - and it has been given an attractive price because it is ‘so big’. Estate agent James Gibbs said: ‘If it was a tenth of the size it would probably still be the same price so you’re basically getting 90 per cent free.’ Also available for £500,000: Moreton House is a 28-bedroom 'gentleman's residence' near near Bideford, Devon, which was completed in 1821 - 60 years after work commenced . Moreton House: This property boasts a wealth of period features and elegantly proportioned rooms spread over 32,000 sq ft - making it more than 30 times the size of a typical British new build . Work on the . mansion is thought to have been started in 1760 and it was completed in . 1821. George Buck, the High Sheriff of Devon, lived in the home. Canning . Place Mews has its own caretaker present between 8am and 12pm each day. To the rear of the garage are a number of cupboards and it also has a . mezzanine for storage. It . is the latest lock-up to be offered with a whopping price-tag in the . capital.  But while a number of these attract an inflated price because . of the potential to be developed, this will remain a garage. It is being offered leasehold and only has 92 years left on its lease - with any buyer expected to pay a further £300 per year in ground rent and maintenance charges. The garage has been put up for sale with South Kensington estate agent John D Wood. But it is not the most expensive one of its kind. A new record was set in April for the most expensive garage in Britain, after a 568ft former coach house in Camberwell, south London, was sold for £550,000 - triple the asking price. Interior: For the same price as the garage, you could get this country mansion in Devon, a picturesque cottage in the Cotswolds or an equestrian centre in Scotland . Near to the royals: The garage is located a 10-minute walk from Kensington Palace in Central London where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge live . Marina Collett, associate director of John D Wood & Co, in South Kensington, said the garage got its jaw-dropping price because it is located in ‘one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in the world’. She added: ‘This substantial and secure garage is discretely located just to the west of Palace Gate in Kensington, one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in the world and a very different market to the rest of the country. 'While it is out of the reach for most of us mere mortals, I am sure someone will see it as a reasonable price' Henry Pryor, property expert . ‘Purely its location alone, moments from Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace, makes this garage a valuable asset. Canning Place is surrounded by very high value residential properties, the vast majority of which do not have either off-street parking or a garage.’ Canning Place Mews has an average house value of £1.7million, which is much less than the average asking price in its postcode of W8 of £3.9million. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property expert, added: ‘While it is out of the reach for most of us mere mortals, I am sure someone will see it as a reasonable price.’ The Kensington garage is not the only London lock-up with a hefty asking price. Many tiny spaces in the capital have sold for a small fortune with buyers keen to take advantage of their investment potential. In 2010, a dilapidated row of . storage units in Primrose Hill went on the market with a whopping . £1.25million asking price. But the new owner could rest assured that . they would own property in the same trendy area as Kate Moss. In 2012 a 20ft-long garage . went on the market for £525,000, but that was because of its pricey . postcode in Knightsbridge - home to Harrods and some of the world's . richest people. In October 2013 a double garage sold in Highgate sold for a cool £251,000. For the money the new owner can enjoy mains electricity in each of the two garages, and there is an option of connecting to water on-site. In August 2013 a 224 sq ft Highgate lock-up, which had been converted into a studio flat, went on the market for £250,000. In April, a ramshackle garage next to a South London industrial estate in Camberwell became the most expensive ever to sell in Britain after going under the hammer for £550,000 in a 'frenzied' bidding war.","'Substantial and secure' garage has 8ft 5in x 9ft 2in door and is £100,000 more than the average London home .

"David Rudisha dominated the 800 metres at the London 2012 Olympics like a true champion and he lost the Commonwealth Games final like one, too. The world record-holder and Olympic champion had only praise for his conqueror Nijel Amos, the Botswanan who won silver behind Rudisha two years ago but sprinted clear of the tall, elegant Kenyan in the straight to win Commonwealth gold in 1min 45.18sec on Thursday night. Rudisha’s gallantry in defeat was reciprocated by 20-year-old Amos, who called the silver medallist ‘a gentleman who to me will always be the hero of the 800m’. Upset: Botswana's Nijel Amos (centre) caused a surprised by beating world-record holder David Rudisha (right) in the Commonwealth Games' 800m final at a wet Hampden Park . Distraught: Rudisha stands with his hands on his hips after only managing silver in the 800m final . Joy and despair: Amos (second left) and Rudisha (right) sprint towards the finish line of the 800m final . Roles reversed: Amos came second to Rudisha in the London 2012 800m final two years ago . VIDEO Commonwealth Games: Day 8 review . Amos added: ‘I don’t think I am the man in the 800m. I will think that if I break the world record five times.Rudisha is a good man and has such sportmanship. Every time I run with him it makes me grow up. ‘He congratulated me and said, “Well done, my brother”. He always inspires me to go hard.’ It was a race that lived up to its billing as one of the highlights of the Games, with Rudisha bravely trying to dictate from the front, as is his style, but leading by only a couple of metres coming into the home straight. Amos, the fastest 800m runner in the world this year, was boxed in initially but spotted a gap after some help from training partner Andre Olivier of South Africa, who finished third. His shorter, snappier strides quickly countered Rudisha’s long, loping sprint for the line. It meant there was to be no fairytale comeback on British soil for 25-year-old Rudisha, who missed all of last season with a knee injury. Rudisha said: ‘I found it a little bit difficult, all because of not good preparation this year. But Nijel is a tough competitor. I think he was good tonight.’ Leading from the front: Rudisha tried to win the race from the head of the pack but came up just short . Smiles: Rudisha still seemed happy with his silver medal as he paraded with the Kenyan flag . Focused: Rudisha (centre) led from Amos (left) but he could not hold on to the end of the race . The sodden conditions at Hampden Park did not prevent another thrilling middle-distance race in the men’s T54 1500m, a race six-time Paralympic champion David Weir has been thinking about since celebrating his four gold medals at London 2012. The prospect of winning Commonwealth gold for England put ‘The Weirwolf’ off retirement, and he duly delivered again last night, winning in 3min 21.67sec. Any worries about how his suede and leather gloves would grip the rims of his wheels were brushed aside as the 35-year-old took the lead with 300 metres to go and never looked back. ‘This is why I carried on,’ he said. ‘It feels like London, with so many English flags. It’s been great.’ Surprise: Botswana's Amos was overjoyed as he crossed the line and claimed Commonwealth gold . Strain: Amos grimaces as he passes Rudisha while the Kenyan glances to his right running towards the line . Victory: David Weir stormed to T54 1500m gold on a wet Hampden Park track in the Commonwealth Games . Joy: Jodie Williams (right) won silver and Bianca Williams (left) bronze in the 200m Commonwealth final . Joy: Scotland's Eilidh Child wins 400m hurdles silver on home soil at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . There was more success for England’s young sprinters, too. Jodie Williams, 20, and Bianca Williams, 21, won silver and bronze in the women’s 200m behind Nigeria’s Blessing Okagbare, who celebrated her second Commonwealth gold after victory in the 100m on Monday. Anyika Onuora, 29, also finished fourth as all three English sprinters set personal bests. Williams’s time of 20.50sec also equalled the second fastest ever run by a British woman. Shara Proctor, the British record-holder, was forced to retire in the first round of the long jump final and left the track in tears clutching her left hamstring, but Jazmin Sawyers of England turned bronze into silver with her final leap of the competition. The 20-year-old, a former British youth bobsledder, jumped 6.54m to finish second behind Ese Brume of Nigeria. British champion Eilidh Child, Scotland’s poster girl for these Games, won silver in the 400m hurdles in 55.02sec. Despite a deafening roar from the crowd, the 27-year-old was unable to run down the pre-race favourite and gold medallist Kaliese Spencer of Jamaica over the final two hurdles. England’s Jade Jones, 18, also won bronze in the women’s T54 1500m in 4min 0.19sec. The teenager is coached by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the 11-time Paralympic champion and her husband Ian Thompson. Jones said: ‘I really didn’t expect this.

"The Ebola virus is continuing its rampage throughout West Africa with the number of people infected doubling every three to four weeks. So far, more than 8,000 people are thought to have contracted the disease, and almost half of those have died, according to the World Health Organisation. In the battle to stem the virus, health organisations are turning towards data generated by social media and mobile technology - with some hoping it may even help find a cure. Scroll down for video and interactive map . Text messages are helping in the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leon with people receiving public health text alerts and sending messages about food security to aid agencies . For instance, text messages are helping in the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone, with people receiving public health text alerts and sending messages about food security to aid agencies. The initiative was started by the Word Food Programme (WFP) in an effort to source information about household food security for those at risk. So far, more than 850 people have responded to a survey which was sent to mobile phone subscribers randomly by location, and involved answering ten text messages. '[An] advantage of mobile data collection is that is it quicker than sending around teams to do face to face surveys around the country,' said Jean-Martin Bauer, a WFP food security analyst. Researchers are collecting mobile phone mast activity data from operators and mapping where calls to helplines are located. Pictured is an example of mobile phone data collected from Côte d'Ivoire to monitor Ebola by Flowminder.org . The Ebola virus is continuing its rampage throughout West Africa with the number of people infected doubling every three to four weeks. So far, more than 8,000 people are thought to have contracted the disease, and almost half of those have died, according to the World Health Organisation. Pictured on the left is a health worker, and on the left a demonstration hoping to stem the spread of Ebola . Big data is the term used to describe extremely large data sets that can be analysed to reveal widespread patterns, trends, and associations. The amount of data is usually so large that it requires a computer to process the information, rather than just a person or group of people. Big data is usually used to better understand human behaviour and trends within society - both on the small scale and globally. 'In a public health emergency, where the situation of communities is changing by the week, this helps WFP have more timely information to shape our response.' The Red Cross and Red Crescent also hope to extend a text message-based system used to advise people about Ebola in to seven West African nations. The facility will allow the charities to send SMS messages to every switched-on handset in an area by drawing its shape on a computer-generated map. Meanwhile, the BBC has started sending Whatsapp alerts that include short audio clips and low-resolution photos to people threatened by Ebola. Within just four hours of launching the service, more than 1,000 people signed up for its Ebola alerts, which are sent in both English and French. As well as sending alerts, technology is helping health agencies monitor trends in outbreaks by their speed, number and location. Zoom in on the interactive map to see areas affected by the Ebola outbreak. Move the markers on the bottom bar to change the date . This year has seen the worst outbreak in history of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The outbreak has a mortality rate of around 50 per cent. This scene shows bodies being taken away in Sierra Leone . One example is Harvard University's HealthMap which flagged up a 'mystery haemorrhagic fever' nine days before the World Health Organisation announced the Ebola epidemic. The fever was seen developing in the forested areas of southeastern Guinea by a free online tool known as HealthMap on March 19. Ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent. In the current outbreak that is just over 50 per cent. It is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats, which are eaten as a delicacy. The virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people. Symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. People are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days. Although the disease has no cure, modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down. The US group behind the software started putting out alerts and providing information to the World Health Organisation, which reported its first confirmed case of Ebola on March 23. Since then, the HealthMap team has created an interactive Ebola map, free to use by anyone who wants to see where the disease is spreading. The map, run by scientists in Boston, uses algorithms to scour tens of thousands of social media sites, local news and government websites to detect and track disease outbreaks. It then filters out irrelevant data to identify dangerous diseases and map their locations with the help of health experts. 'It shows some of these informal sources are helping paint a picture of what's happening that's useful to these public health agencies,' said HealthMap co-founder John Brownstein. Ebola is transmitted by human contact, which means knowing where people are moving can provide valuable insight to researchers trying to contain the outbreak. 'Big data has really changed epidemiology,' Madhav Marathe, director of Virginia Bioinformatics Institute's Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory told International Business Times. Mr Marathe has been working with the U.S. Department of Defense for almost a decade to help track diseases like and predict how they might spread. In addition to using information send via text message, the team have turned to updates on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. A project by the group, dubbed '#HackEbola', gathers the data put out by local ministries of health and publishes the results online. Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collecting mobile phone mast activity data from operators and mapping where calls to helplines are located. While this data has proved valuable, experts claim that more resources are needed to analyse the data faster. If they manage this, scientists believe big data analytics could help provide an off-the-shelf Ebola vaccine. But that may still be some way off. 'We're learning all this from scratch - we've never had this level of data before,' Qlik's David Bolton told the BBC. 'So it's probably too early to say whether big data analytics is having a meaningful impact on the rate and spread of the disease, but at least it is helping us decide where to allocate our resources.'

"A multi-millionaire aristocrat whose £4million eco-home burnt to cinders on a castaway island has won a seven-figure damages claim against a building firm.

The Honourable Edward Iliffe, 45, bought Green Island for £2.5million in 2005 - and planned to develop a . luxury holiday retreat for his family. He is pictured with the property as it was being constructed . Legal dispute: Feltham Construction, which oversaw much of the green building's development, denied that the chimney was 'assembled and installed in a non-standard and defective manner' Mr Iliffe, and his wife Teleri, 49, of . Newbury, Berkshire, launched legal action against Feltham Construction, . a firm involved in building the home, demanding £3.5million in damages. Yesterday, a top judge has . ruled Feltham was indirectly responsible for the defective installation . of a logburner or flue that caused the blaze - and ordered the firm to . pay compensation. Mr . Justice Stuart-Smith, sitting at London’s High Court, said the . six-bedroom solar-panelled home was in the final phase of construction, . which included the fitting of a two-way log-burning stove with heat . exchanger and stainless steel flue, when the fire ignited. The . logburner had been used for just two weeks, including by the Iliffe . family who stayed at the chalet over Easter 2012, when an electrical . contractor reported hearing ‘funny cracking noises’. The . blaze was discovered in the roof space at about 7am on April 20, 2011 . and, although 45 firefighters were ferried to the island, pumping . seawater in a bid to douse the flames, the house was ‘largely . destroyed’, the judge said. The . Iliffes and their three children, Alys, 17, Henry, 14, and Victoria, . 12, were heartbroken by the destruction of what they had hoped would be a . Swallows and Amazons-style retreat.

A forensic fire expert appointed by . the family who examined the debris said the fire probably started . ‘within the roof construction and specifically in that part of the roof . close to the chimney’. His . ‘stong view’ was that combustible materials were closer to the chimney . than the 1.97in (50mm) distance required, adding: ‘On the balance of . probability, the cause of the fire was the failure to comply with . building regulations when installing the flue’. But . Feltham, which oversaw much of the green building’s development, denied . that the chimney was ‘assembled and installed in a non-standard and . defective manner’. It also disputed claims that the fire originated in the roof space and the value of the family’s £3.5million damages claim. Feltham . claimed it was not responsible as the flue and logburner were installed . by a sub-contractor with whom it only placed an order on behalf of Mr . Iliffe, who is the great grandson of newspaper magnate, Lord Iliffe.

Location: The island is just off the Dorset coast, near Poole and the exclusive Sandbanks peninsula . The firm also argued it oversaw the last phase of the works without a proper contract. On the cause of the fire, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said that, as it had never been suggested the logburner or chimney were inadequately designed, the Iliffes’ case that installation flaws caused the fire was ‘overwhelming’. ‘I therefore conclude with the certainty necessary to justify summary judgment that the fire was caused in the roof space as a result of defective installation of the logburner or flue... there is no realistic prospect of any other explanation or cause being established.’ The judge also found that an email from Mr and Mrs Iliffe’s architect ‘gave sufficient certainty for the conclusion of a contract’ with Feltham and that the instruction given for the firm to arrange the works were ‘clear’. He ruled: ‘Feltham was responsible in contract for the acts and omissions of its sub-contractors’. Mr Justice Stuart-Smith entered summary judgment for Mr and Mrs Iliffe against Feltham. The exact value of their damages award has yet to be assessed.","Honourable Edward Iliffe bought Green Island in Dorset for £2.5m in 2005 .

"Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson, 49, delivered a eulogy for the ages in honour of Gough Whitlam on Wednesday, referring in most reverent terms to Australia 21st prime minister as 'this old man' who was 'truly Australia's greatest white elder'. As he listed off the Whitlam achievements one-by-one, he told the congregation in Sydney's Town Hall and those watching in Melbourne, Canberra and Cabramatta, that Gough Whitlam provided equalities and opportunities to his people, unmatched before or since. Those present were held spellbound by the Martin Luther King-esque oratory, in which the renowned lawyer and academic announced 'I don’t know why someone with this old man’s upper-middle class background could carry such a burning conviction that the barriers of class and race of the Australia of his upbringing and maturation should be torn down and replaced with the unapologetic principle of equality'. Scroll down for video . 'When he breathed he truly was Australia's greatest white elder and friend without peer to the original Australians' Noel Pearson said of late former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam . The Noel Pearson speech inside Sydney's Town Hall was warmly received inside and outside . Australian's Aboriginal community turned out in numbers to pay tribute to former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam at the State Memorial Service in Sydney . Many people had to be turned away from the spill-over in the St Andrew's courtyard to watch the State Memorial Service for former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam . 'I can scarcely point to any white Australian political leader of his vintage and of generations following of whom it could be said without a shadow of doubt, he harboured not a bone of racial ethnic or gender prejudice in his body.' Mr Pearson outlined how important the Whitlam overhaul of discrimination laws was to Australia's indigenous communities. 'Raised next to the wood-heap of the nation's democracy, bequeathed no allegiance to no political party I speak to this old man's legacy with no partisan brief,' he announced. 'Rather, my signal honour today on behalf of more people than I could ever know, is to express our immense gratitude for the public service of this old man. 'Outlawing the discrimination that my father and his father lived under since my grandfather was removed to the mission as a boy.' He would go on to tell the story of when, in 1976, in the western Cape York peninsular, Aboriginal farmer John Kuwata sought to buy a pastoral lease from its white owner but the Queensland Government refused the sale. The High Court, however, upheld the then Racial Discrimination Act. A candle is lit next to a portrait of former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam at Sydney Town Hall ahead of his State Memorial Service. Gough Whitlam was the 21st Prime Minister of Australia. He died on October 21, aged 98 . 'However, in an act of spite the Queensland Government converted the lease into national park,' he stated. 'John Kuwata died a broken man. The winner of a landmark High Court precedent but the victim of an appalling discrimination. 'Without this old man, the land and human rights of our people would never have seen the light of day. 'There would never have been Mabo and its importance to the history of Australia would have been lost without the Whitlam program. 'Only those who have known discrimination truly know its evil. 'Only those who have never experienced prejudice can discount the importance of the Racial Discrimination Act. This old man was one of those rare people who never suffered discrimination but understood the importance of protection from its malice.' His next statement drew a rousing reception. Those listening to Noel Pearson's requiem heard him say that 'without this old man, the land and human rights of our people would never have seen the light of day' Emotional times. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd listens intently as speakers, including Noel Pearson and Cate Blanchett, pay tribute to Gough Whitlam . 'The Whitlam Government is the text-book case of reform trumping management,' he stated. 'In less than three years, an astonishing reform agenda, leapt off the policy platform and into legislation and the machinery and programs of government. 'The country would change forever, the modern cosmopolitan Australia finally emerged like a technicolour butterfly from its long dormant chrysalis. 'And 38 years later we are like John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin's Jewish Insurgence ranting against the despotic rule of Rome, defiantly demanding ""and what did the Romans ever do for us anyway?"" 'Apart from Medibank and the Trade Practices Act, cutting tariff protections, no-fault divorce and the family law act, the Australia Council, the Federal Court, the Order of Australia, federal legal aid, the racial discrimination act, needs-based school funding, the recognition of China, the abolition of conscription, the law reform commission, student financial assistance, the heritage commission, non discriminatory immigration laws, community health clinics, Aboriginal land rights, paid maternity leave for public servants, lowering the minimum voting age to 18 years and fair electoral boundaries and senate representation for the territories ... apart from all this, what did this Roman ever do for us?' Mr Pearson,  founder of the Cape York Institute for Policy, told those listening that Mr Whitlam was before his time. 'There is no need for nostalgia and yearning for what might have been,' he said. 'The achievements of this old man are present in the institutions we today take for granted and played no small part in the progress in modern Australia . 'There is no need to regret three years was too short, was any more time needed? 'The breadth and depth of the reforms secured in that short and tumultuous period were unprecedented and will likely never again be repeated. 'The devil-may-care attitude to management as opposed to reform is unlikely to be seen again by governments whose priorities are to retain power rather than reform. 'We could not be more indebted to this old man's foresight and moral vision for universal opportunity. 'We salute this old man for his great love and dedication to his country and to the Australian people. 'When he breathed he truly was Australia's greatest white elder and friend without peer to the original Australians.'","Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson holds congregations spellbound with his speech at the Gough Whitlam State Memorial Service .

"An IT expert has been left in a web of fear after a massive spider has moved into his home. Darren Driscoll, 43, from Plymouth, Devon, filmed his encounter with the eight-legged fiend after spotting a funnel-shaped cobweb outside his house. He used a stick to poke it but as he did a large, green-fanged spider came charging out of its nest. Scroll down for video . The spider has made a nest at Darren Driscoll's home in Plymouth, Devon, leaving his family terrified. The IT worker believes it is a tube-web spider and says it's doubled in size since he first noticed it in August . The father-of-three says the spider has doubled in size since he first noticed it in August and fears the colder weather could make his home a welcome invite for the arachnid. Mr Driscoll believes the spider is a segstria fiorentina – more commonly known as the tube-web spider. The spiders sow distinctive tube-shaped webs in cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands. They first entered the UK 150 years ago from continental Europe, arriving on ships docking in ports such as Plymouth. Their bites are non-fatal but can cause a sharp injection-like pain lasting for hours. Although the spiders are still an unusual sight, experts warn the long, hot summer is helping them thrive. The spider can be seen darting out the hole checking for prey after Mr Driscoll poked it with a stick . Mr Driscoll said: ‘By the look of it I would say it had more than doubled in size from when I first saw it two months ago. ‘I decided to tease it out so I got a piece of grass and poked the outside of its web. ‘It instantly charged out to grab the piece of grass. It is a really aggressive little thing, no fear at all.’ Tube-web spiders (Segestria florentina) is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm. Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year. They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours. They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it. Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique. He added: ‘I think it is a tube-web spider, and I was surprised to hear it has such a painful bite, like being stabbed with a nail. ‘It’s something I’d like to avoid, let’s put it that way.’ Mr Driscoll, who is married but is separated from his wife, continued: ‘I’m not worried about getting bitten right now as it’s quite out the way. But if it heads inside for the winter then I might be in trouble.’ Tube-web spiders are one of the largest spiders in Europe and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches, moths, bees and wasps. The females tend to be larger than males and can reach a body length of up to 22mm. Kelvin Boot, a naturalist and former BBC radio presenter, said the tube web-spider might look scary but says it’s not dangerous to humans. He said: ‘It bites in defence so if you pick one up, or it gets caught in your clothing, you are likely to be nipped. But no British spider delivers a fatal bite or even one dangerous to humans. ‘It seems this spider was accidentally introduced into UK from its native Mediterranean and North Africa. ‘It sits at the mouth of its tunnel in old brickwork or behind loose bark or any other suitable hole, waiting for a hapless insect to stumble across the spokes - tripwires that alert the spider to its victim. ‘Once detected, the spider moves like lightning. I defy anybody not to jump when this happens as it is such a surprise even if you are expecting it. ‘The prey is dragged back into the narrow tube and eventually the spider’s venom overcomes the prey.’ A tube-web spider, which was spotted last week in Southampton, are believed to be the biggest in Europe .","Darren Driscoll filmed terrifying encounter after spotting funnel-shaped web .

"The inter-caste marriage of Divya (left) and Ilavarasan (right) sparked riots in Dharmapuri and was blamed for her father's suicide . The family of a low caste man, who was found dead on the side of a railway track, say he was murdered for daring to marry a woman from a higher social group. Ilavarasan, 23, part of the Dalit community, formally known as Untouchables, and Divya, 20, a higher caste Vanniyar, sparked riots in Tamil Nadu last year when they married in secret. Her father committed suicide over her refusal to end the marriage and 300 Dalit homes were torched in retribution. Ilavarasan was found dead two weeks ago with a serious head wound, a day after Divya said she had ended the marriage. Local authorities believe he committed suicide but his family insist he was murdered and say he has become a martyr for the Dalit community. Their story sparked intense media interest in India and triggered heated debate on inter-caste marriage and anti-Dalit violence. While inter-caste marriages are increasingly common in India, they are still frowned upon in some, particularly rural, areas. Women who marry 'down' a caste also face greater social stigma as they are responsible for protecting the family honour. Hundreds of people attended Ilavarasan's funeral on Sunday, despite a court order prohibiting anyone but family members. However, Divya did not attend. Ilavarasan's family now plan to turn his burial site at his native village of Natham into a memorial with a library. His father Llango told NDTV: 'Inter-caste couples can come here to take inspiration from Ilavarasan.' The couple hit the headlines in November . last year after Divya's father committed suicide when she refused to . leave her new husband. Ilavarasan died two weeks ago and his family believe he was murdered for marrying a higher caste woman . Three hundred homes in the Dalit communities of Natham, Anna Nagar and Konampatt were torched during a riot and families said they lost all their belongings and savings in the violence. The Times of India reported that Divya, who is studying to become a nurse, announced she had separated from Ilavarasan on July 1 because she was haunted by the death of her father. According to the newspaper she said she would stay with her mother 'for the time being' but within days her husband was found dead. A post-mortem revealed he died of a head injury but Ilavarasan's parents demanded a second autopsy. The results are due to be announced at the Madras High Court this week.","Ilavarasan, a Dalit, and Divya, a Vanniyar, sparked riots when they married .

"Real Madrid fielded the most expensive line-up in history for their Super Cup victory over Sevilla, with the 11 players costing the club an astonishing total of £364million in transfer fees. But while Real are far and away the biggest spenders on the planet, despite PSG's attempts in recent years, England’s finest have not been shy of opening the chequebook either as money in the game grows exponentially.

"India is to send its last ever telegram this weekend, bringing to an end a 162-year-old service originally set up in the heyday of the British Raj. With one final STOP at the end, the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), India’s state-run telegram service, will wire its final message to an as yet unknown location on Sunday. The service, the last of its type in the world, still sends around 5,000 telegrams a day and employs 998 people in its 75 offices. All stop: A worker taps out a telegram at the Central Telegraph Office in New Delhi. India disbanded the world's last major telegram service on Sunday . Final posts: An Indian telegram messenger holds up some of the last messages to go out at the Central Telegraph Office in New Delhi . But that is a far cry from its peak in 1985 when it was relaying some 60 million messages every year and employing 12,000 people. Today the remaining customers consist mainly of local government offices sending administrative messages to remote areas which are still not covered by the phone networks. Back in the days of the British Raj, the telegram service proved an absolutely vital means of control for a colonial power ruling over a vast expanse of land. The first 27-mile stretch of line was laid by the East India Company between Calcutta and Diamond Harbour as early as 1851. To . cope with India's stifling heat and humidity, the cables used were far . thicker than those in Europe and North America and were covered with a . layer of cloth and pitch to keep out the dust and monsoon rains. Origins: A team of workers lays the underwater cable that stretched from India to Britain in 1870 . Mechanics: A museum employee in Bhopal with an 1837 telegraphy machine of the type used in the early years . The network grew exponentially. One of the most famous early messages was . sent to Lord Dalhousie in Calcutta in April 1852 announcing the fall of . Rangoon during the during the second Anglo-Burmese war. And when Indian troops rebelled in . 1857, sparking a widespread uprising against colonial rule, the telegram . is credited with playing a crucial role in helping the British mobilise . and regain control. After the uprising was quelled, Lord Dalhousie famously credited the telegram as having 'saved India for the British Empire'. BK . Syngal, former Managing director of VSNL, which had a mandate to send . telegrams overseas until 2002, told the Hindustan Times: 'The telegraph . allowed the British to relay information across large parts of India in . almost real time. Communication: Mahatma Gandhi, who led the struggle for Indian independence, relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds . 'This leap in communications proved decisive'. In 1870, underwater cables were laid between India and Britain providing a vital link between Westminster and Britain's largest and most valuable colony. But like many innovations introduced by the British, the telegram was quickly adopted by Indians for their own use. Mahatma Gandhi, who led the struggle for Indian independence, relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds. And during the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, the telegram would prove a vital link between families and friends at opposite ends of the country. Santosh Sharma, who sixty-six years ago left Pakistan for New Delhi, remembers how she then used telegrams to keep in touch with her loved ones. 'Crossing the border meant risking your own life,' she told AFP, 'At that time the telegram was the only way to keep families informed, give speedy updates and reunite.' Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also relied on the telegram famously sending British Prime Minister Clement Attlee a message to request help from London when Pakistani troops invaded Kashmir. R.K. Rai, a retired telegraph operator in . New Delhi, remembers the service in its pomp as hundreds of workers . crashed out the dots and dashes of Morse Code used on telegraph . machines. He told AFP: 'The whole office sounded like a factory,' he remembers. 'Sometimes we felt we knew every significant detail of our customer's lives. 'The word privacy did not exist in anyone's dictionary then.' The service continued to be invaluable up until the 1990s with the advent of mobile communications. Today Raj's old office, a colonial style building in the centre of capital barely sends out 10 messages a day and will soon be closed. He added: 'The new technology is so fast it just surprises me. Communication is a game of speed, the fastest will always win the game. 'Eventually the telegraph system had to face defeat.'","India's state-run BSNL network is the world's last major telegram service .

"The £100million cocaine yacht stormed by Irish marines was skippered through its weeks-long Atlantic voyage by an old-age pensioner from West Yorkshire, authorities say. The 70-year-old British suspect was arrested aboard the 60ft Makayabella along with two other men, aged 35 and 28, allegedly with bales of cocaine so big they used them as makeshift furniture. All three are from West Yorkshire, where police have arrested two other men, aged 45 and 47. A sixth man is being hunted on suspicion of involvement in a smuggling operation. Scroll down for video . Police lead away the skipper of the Makayabella after it was seized on the way past Ireland . Customs officials aboard the yacht Makayabella in Haulbowline naval base, Cobh, Co Cork after the Irish Navy intercepted the vessel suspected of carrying around £100million worth of cocaine . The yacht has been tracked by authorities in several countries as it left Venezuela, stopping off in Trinidad, before being stormed by an elite Navy squad 200 nautical miles off Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point . The 70-year-old skipper is believed to have been an experienced sailor. The smugglers are believed to have planned to transfer the cocaine onto a smaller boat at sea before ferrying it to shore in North Wales. Under armed guard today, the one tonne haul was offloaded from the yacht onto the docks at Haulbowline naval base in Cork harbour, where it was towed to last night. The yacht was tracked by authorities in several countries as it left Venezuela, stopping off in Trinidad, before being intercepted by the Irish navy 200 nautical miles off Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point. During the tense night-time sea raid, two teams set off from the coastal patrol vessel LE Niamh on smaller inflatable boats, armed with pistols and batons. 'It was a particularly dark night,' said Captain David Barry of the Irish Navy. 'We believe they had no idea we were there until we were actually on board.' Members of the navy stand with the haul of cocaine thought to be worth in the region of £100million. If that value is confirmed it will be one of the biggest drug seizures in Europe this year. Closing in: The patrol vessel LE Niamh tails the yacht Makayabella . The crew put up no resistance and no arms have been yet found on board. They were said to be in reasonably good condition for being at sea for so long. They were literally sitting on the bales of cocaine when they were intercepted. The yacht was in reasonable condition but the sails had been damaged and it had developed engine problems and it had to be towed into Cork harbour by the naval ship LE Roisin. The three Britons arrested on board the vessel are being questioned at Bridewell Garda Station in Cork under drug trafficking laws. They can be held for seven days. The UK National Crime Agency, French and Venezuelan authorities as well as the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre based in Lisbon were all involved in the international effort. Security sources in Britain believe the consignment was destined for the north of England. The men on board the yacht put up no resistance to the armed Irish Navy team . Details of the naval operation were kept secret for more than a day-and-a-half. The National Crime Agency confirmed a 43-year-old man had been arrested in the Leeds area. He was detained in the early hours of yesterday on suspicion of conspiring to import Class A drugs in an operation assisted by officers from West Yorkshire Police. He was subsequently bailed until January. Earlier, today a 47-year-old man from Leeds was arrested also arrested and is being questioned at a police station in the West Yorkshire area. Detectives said they are still seeking another individual from the area. Hank Cole, Head of International Operations for the National Crime Agency, said the investigation is ongoing. 'Thanks to the co-operation between the NCA and our Irish, French and Venezuelan colleagues, we have managed to prevent this cocaine reaching our streets and causing damage to communities,' he said. 'I pay tribute to all those involved.' The yacht Makayabella is led into Haulbowline naval base, Cobh, Co Cork . Investigation: Customs officials aboard the Makayabella . The passage around the south-west coast of Ireland has been well used in recent times by drugs smugglers bringing shipments from South America and Africa into Europe. Authorities describe it as the western frontier of Europe. In 2007, a record £344 million of cocaine was seized in Dunlough Bay in west Cork when a UK gang botched an attempt to bring the massive haul ashore on a smaller boat and capsized in rough weather. Most of the group, including two Englishmen, were arrested in follow-up operations and eventually given lengthy prison sentences. Just a year later, a £312 million haul was intercepted on the Dances With Waves yacht about 150 miles off Mizen Head. Three British men on board were later jailed for 10 years each for their part in the plot. The mastermind, John Alan Brooks, was jailed for 28 years for the plot to bring the massive haul to England from Venezuela.

"In action: Moses Sesay is pictured during the road race time trial at the Commonwealth Games . An athlete at the Commonwealth Games has revealed he was hospitalised and put into isolation for four days while he was tested for the deadly Ebola virus. Cyclist Moses Sesay, from Sierra Leone in West Africa where hundreds are reported to have died from the flesh-eating virus, was admitted to hospital in Glasgow after feeling unwell and developing fever-like symptoms. However, he was later given the all-clear and competed in the road race time trial. The 32-year-old said he and other athletes were scared of returning home because of Ebola and would try to remain in Britain until their special three-month visas for the Games expired. Sesay, who comes from the Rotifunk Moyamba area of Sierra Leone which has been hit by the disease, said: ‘I was sick, I felt tired and listless.  All the doctors were in special suits to treat me – they dressed like I had Ebola.  I was very scared.’ Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he continued: ‘I was admitted for four days and they tested me for Ebola. 'It came back negative but they did it again and this time sent it to London where it was also negative.’ The father of one, who competed in the Games on his 32nd birthday, finished last in his race. He had arrived in Glasgow among a team of two dozen competitors and officials the week before the Games and felt unwell last Thursday, the day after he attended the Opening Ceremony.

"A former bouncer has lost more than 20st in weight - but gained rolls of sagging flesh which now cascade down his body. Marius Stoicas, from Bucharest, still tips the scales at over 15st - but says that is a 'dream weight' compared to his previous size. He was so large that it cost him his job as a bodyguard. Aged 34, when he was at his heaviest - an astonishing 35st 7lb - he could not dress himself . or tie his own shoe laces. Marius Stoicas weighed an astonishing 35st before he lost weight and was unable to even tie his own shoes . Marius's 21st stone weight loss has left him with massive folds of excess skin, gaining him the nick name of 'Shar Pei man' in his hometown . He said: ‘Sometimes I'd get work as a bouncer, and all I needed to do was stand in the doorway to keep people out, they couldn't budge me.’ But the former bouncer said that in the end he knew it was diet or die. However, since losing weight, Marius, from the Romanian capital Bucharest, now feels ‘a different man’. Although it is hard for him to look in the mirror because of his skin hanging loose, he said he still owes 'everything' to the doctor who helped to get him on the diet. Now he will need a further operation to remove the masses of hanging skin which so torment him. Plastic surgeon Cristian Radu Jecan (L) says he is already planning the skin operation, but Marius is still trying to raise the £4,000 needed for the operation . ‘I was reborn. From 500lbs to 190lbs (35st 7lb to 13st 7lb). I could not run, I needed help to put my shoes on’, Marius said. ‘But I will have to scrape together 5,000 Euro (£4,000) before I can have the skin removed.’ Plastic surgeon Cristian Radu Jecan says he is already planning the skin operation. ‘At a rough estimate, we will remove 8-10lbs of tissue and a skin surface of three square feet, given that the entire surface of the body is 20-25 square feet for an adult of average weight and height. That is 10-20 per cent of the total area,’ the doctor said. ‘Because it is a very delicate surgery, there are risks,’ he added, saying it needed to be done carefully.","Marius weighed an astonishing 35st before he lost weight .

"Federal officials, amid the worst U.S. biosafety crisis in years, have dismissed 11 eminent scientists from a 23-member panel that advises the government on how and whether research on dangerous pathogens should be conducted. The purged members were informed that their service was no longer needed via an email on Sunday night from Mary Groesch, executive director of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB). Two of the dismissed members told Reuters that the notice came without warning. The panel is overseen by the National Institutes of Health. Serious safety concerns: The CDC has revealed still more safety breaches at some of its top level labs and 11 scientists from a 23-member safety panel were fired via email Sunday night . The action, first reported on Science magazine's website, came two days after federal health officials released details of an investigation of the mishandling of anthrax samples by scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the Independent, four of the scientists have since signed a petition to limit the types of research that may be done into highly dangerous flu types over fears of potential release. That probe turned up numerous additional breaches at CDC, igniting concerns about how scientists at the agency and nationwide handle dangerous microbes. In one newly disclosed incident, CDC scientists contaminated samples of low-pathogenic bird flu viruses with a highly pathogenic strain and in March shipped them to a Department of Agriculture lab, where the viruses promptly killed all the chickens exposed to them. On Wednesday, a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the CDC's biosafety lapses. ‘Add these to the long list of questions we have about how biosecurity is being managed,’ said Committee Chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican. ‘Why hasn't the panel met in years, and why is now the time to dismiss nearly half the experts on this panel tasked with advising the administration on biosecurity?’ String of mistakes: The action came following an investigation into lab safety brought on after dozens of lab technicians and CDC staff were potentially exposed to live anthrax due to human error in June . In the Sunday night email from NIH, which was reviewed by Reuters, Groesch wrote that she ‘wanted to tell you that a new slate of NSABB members has been approved as your replacements, and thus your service on the board is ending.’ ‘This may come as welcome news!’ she wrote, adding that the departing members ‘will be missed.’ An NIH spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday that ‘it is routine for federal advisory committees to rotate their membership over time so that fresh and diverse perspectives can be brought to bear,’ and that the dismissed scientists' terms ‘had been renewed several times.’ One of the dismissed members, Michael Imperiale of the University of Michigan, tweeted that it was a ‘bizarre time to eliminate all institutional memory.’ The biosecurity board does not approve particular experiments but offers policy advice on, among other things, oversight of ‘dual use’ studies, meaning research that could be used for biowarfare or bioterrorism as well as for legitimate purposes.In 2012, for instance, the board recommended that details of experiments on an especially deadly form of avian influenza, H5N1, not be published. They feared the information could be used to create a strain that, unlike the natural form, is highly transmissible between infected people. Another error: Health officials have revealed that a bird flu breach occurred in addition to the anthrax debacle. A CDC lab sent another lab a sample that was supposed to be weak bird flu but had been contaminated with a potent strain and killed all the lab chickens exposed to it . At the time, the board's concerns led to a 60-day self-imposed moratorium on NIH-funded projects on H5N1. One of the dismissed board members expressed surprise that the purge included virtually all of the people with experience of the H5N1 debate and included experts known for communicating openly with fellow scientists and the public on biosafety issues. Dr. Arturo Casadevall of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, for instance, co-authored a 2012 editorial in the journal of the American Society for Microbiology on the H5N1 debate, calling for ‘a clear scientific rationale’ for studies that enable pathogens to be more deadly or contagious than they are in nature. Casadevall was dismissed from the advisory board on Sunday night. Also dismissed was microbiologist Paul Keim of Northern Arizona State University, who played a crucial role in the investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people and infected another 17. Keim's DNA analysis of the anthrax mailed to U.S. senators and news organizations allowed investigators to trace the bacteria to an Army lab in Maryland. ‘I fell over in my seat,’ Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said of the advisory board dismissals. Given the CDC's recent biosafety missteps, ‘this seems to not be the time to make major changes.’","In a newly disclosed incident, CDC scientists contaminated a weak bird flu strain with a vicious strain that promptly killed a group of lab chickens .

"Six major banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays face huge fines for rigging the ‘Wild West’ foreign currency market. The lenders held secret talks with the City watchdog this week to try to thrash out a deal. Those also involved in the negotiations are understood to include HSBC, US banks Citigroup and JPMorgan and Swiss lender UBS. Regulators in the U.S., Asia and Europe suspect traders conspired to fix the £3trillion-a-day ‘FX’ market by rigging rates used when buying and selling currencies. The Financial Conduct Authority (above) is investigating . The fines are expected to be confirmed simultaneously, with the total bill set to be as high as £2billion and one bank facing a fine of between £300million and £400m. Regulators in the United States, Asia and Europe suspect traders conspired to fix the £3trillion-a-day ‘FX’ market by rigging rates used when buying and selling currencies. Martin Wheatley, of the Financial Conduct Authority, has previously warned the foreign exchange allegations are ‘every bit as bad as they have been with Libor’. Banks including Barclays, RBS and Lloyds have already been fined for rigging the London Interbank Offered Rate – or Libor – a benchmark used to set trillions of pounds of financial contracts including the price of mortgages. Barclays has also been fined £26million for rigging gold prices and is fighting a £300million penalty in the US for manipulating energy markets. Foreign exchange is the biggest financial market in the world, with £3trillion changing hands each day. Barclays has also been fined £26million for rigging gold prices and is fighting a £300million penalty in the US . The probe began last year with whistleblowers likening the unregulated market to the ‘Wild West’. Banks buy and sell foreign currency on behalf of clients but traders can also bet on whether a currency will move up or down. The probe centres on claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders.","Six major banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays to face fines .

"Aitor Karanka says he wants to emulate the success of Steve McClaren at Middlesbrough as the pair do battle for promotion to the Premier League – but admits he won’t be afforded the funds his predecessor enjoyed. McClaren, who takes his table-topping Derby County to the Riverside Stadium at lunchtime on Saturday, wrote his name in Boro’s history books when his side won the League Cup in 2004 – the club’s first trophy – before making it to the UEFA Cup final the following season. Aitor Karanka goes head-to-head with Steve McClaren at Saturday lunchtime . He left to manage England in 2006 with the club established in the Premier League. Three years later they were relegated and Karanka is now the fourth manager since McClaren. But the Spaniard, whose side would go top of the Championship with victory, says his task is tougher than that of the former boss. ‘There was a lot of money then,’ reflected the former Real Madrid defender. ‘Now we have had to build a team without spending too much. The only players we have paid money for are Adam Clayton and Kike. We have sold Lukas Jutkiewicz and Marvin Emnes, so the money is almost the same. So we are doing well without spending big money. Middlesbrough warmed up for top of the bale clash by thrashing Millwall 5-1 at The Den . ‘Maybe at that time (under McClaren) it was about paying a lot of money to convince players to come here. Now it is about getting players here who believe in the project. That’s the most important thing.’ Karanka, who was fined £2,000 and serves a one-match touchline ban after admitting an FA charge of improper conduct following his sending-off against Blackburn, added: ‘I looked at what Steve did here. If I knew now that in the future I would achieve what he did then I would be a happy man. It will take time. We are just one year in and we are in the Championship, promotion is the first step and that is very tough.’ The two managers live in the same part of North Yorkshire, and Karanka said: ‘Sometimes we have been in the same restaurant and we have a good relationship. I will pay the bill at the restaurant if we win this weekend. He can maybe pay my fine!’","Steve McClaren takes table-topping Derby County to Middlesbrough .

"Neil Hunt sent 'inappropriate' messages to the 16-year-old schoolgirl while teaching at the school in Wales . A teacher who bombarded a 16-year-old pupil with drunken text messages was reported to school bosses when the teenager learned he had started an affair with a colleague. Among the sordid messages exchanged by 46-year-old Neil Hunt and Pupil A was one in which he asked the girl: 'Have you ever been really turned on?'. The girl reported him to school bosses in May 2012, but he was allowed to keep his job at Queen Elizabeth High School in Carmarthen, Wales, for six months after telling police there had only been a 'handful' of messages. When officers checked his phone again, they realised he had in fact sent hundreds of suggestive messages to the teenager late at night when he was drunk. The hearing was told how he had a 'profound' effect on the girl whose exams suffered as a result of their relationship. Mr Neil was not her teacher, but is thought to have coached her at a local cycling club. When the teenager was told he was having an affair with a female colleague, she told other staff at the school of their text messages. But when questioned, Mr Hunt told police and school staff there had only been a 'handful' of messages which he regretted sending. He was allowed to keep his job and was given a formal written warning. Headteacher Peter Spencer told the hearing: 'Had the true extent of text messages been known to me I would have dealt with the matter entirely differently.' The Professional Conduct Committee Hearing of the General Teaching Council for Wales heard how there was a 'sexual overtone' to the text messages. 'The text messages had a sexual overtone,' Mr Spencer added. 'I was concerned about the volume and content of them. They were not what you would expect from a pupil teacher relationship.' 'There were 350 text messages sent between them and a number were inappropriate.' 'He accepted full responsibility for sending the text messages, he said he had been drinking and he sent them in the early hours of the morning. 'He said he should never of send them but he had not sent other messages. He admitted it was a poor error of judgement and he accepted a final written warning."" 'Police said that no further action would be taken.' The 46-year-old was able to keep his job after first telling investigators he had only sent one message while he was drunk . 'As the year went on Pupil A's emotional and mental health deteriorated. 'She said she had received significantly more text messages than originally reported. 'I believe she found it difficult to come to terms with what had happened because she couldn't understand why the police hadn’t discovered the number of text messages received. 'It became apparent that the police hadn't forensically examined her phone.' 'The effect on pupil A was profound, she did not know how to deal with the situation. 'The issue with Mr Hunt severely affected her performance and her exam results suffered as a result.' The hearing heard Mr Hunt felt the girl was 'infatuated' with him while she believed the man was 'stalking her'. After hearing the teacher, with whom she was 'infatuated', was seeing a colleague, the teenager reported him to school bosses . In one exchange, the teacher said he could not sleep as text messages had become 'interesting'. 'Couldn’t sleep if I tried. Since the texts got interesting,' he wrote, before sending her another message the following day apologising for his behaviour. 'My apologies for the texts last night. Too much Stella.' In another text he said: 'You shouldn’t text me when I’m p***ed. Might say the wrong thing.' A statement read on behalf of the teacher said: 'I am now ashamed of my behaviour but I was not in control of my faculties. 'I have no recollection of this period in my life. 'Everything I can remember is mainly due to the help of my family and friends filling in the gaps.' 'I always conduct myself with the utmost integrity.' Mr Hunt admits unacceptable professional conduct by the number and content of the text messages, but denied acting dishonestly by failing to disclose the full extent of their contact. The hearing continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Neil Hunt sent hundreds of messages to the 16-year-old schoolgirl .
