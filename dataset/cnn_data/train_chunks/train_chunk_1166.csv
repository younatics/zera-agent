"Thousands of people around the country took to the streets to protest the federal government's controversial first-term budget on Sunday. The protest, billed as Bust The Budget, aimed to send a message about voter dissatisfaction with the budget on the day before the new Senate sits for the first time. The first rally to kick off was in Brisbane with 800 people marching through the CBD. Scroll down for video . A three-metre puppet of Prime Minister Tony Abbott is seen during a Bust The Budget protest on the lawns of Parliament House in Canberra . Protesters marched along Market Street in Sydney carrying Bust the Budget signs as they protested against the Liberal Government's planned budget cuts . Thousands marched in the Sydney rally, pictured, starting at Sydney Town Hall and taking a circular route along George Street, Market Street, Castlereagh Street and Park Street . More than 2,000 people turned out in Sydney's CBD carrying trade union flags and budget-protest placards. Greens leader Christine Milne told reporters at St Andrew's Square on George Street that the protest was borne out of frustration against planned federal cuts to health and welfare spending. '[Tony Abbott] is making life harder for people,' she said. 'He's making life a misery for people who are unemployed and searching for work.' The anti-budget rally in Canberra featured a three-metre Tony Abbott puppet with smoke coming out of his trousers. Several hundred protesters converged on the lawns in front of Parliament House and chanted 'One term Tony' and 'Liar, Liar, Pants of Fire' at the puppet. 'We may have to call the fire brigade to put his a*** out,' one protester yelled. More than 2,000 people turned out in Sydney's CBD carrying trade union flags and budget-protest placards . Rallies were organised in other major cities across Australia by the Union Movement . Greens leader Christine Milne said Sydney that the protest was borne out of frustration against planned federal cuts to health and welfare spending . The largest protest in the country was held in Melbourne, with Trades Hall claiming that 20,000 people gathered for the rally. Among those at the rally were representatives of various unions, as well as teachers, firefighters and nurses. ACTU secretary Dave Oliver called the protest 'only the beginning of the fight back against the budget,' which he called 'cruel' and leading to a 'growing class of working poor,' the Herald Sun reported. A union official at the Adelaide protest claimed the federal budget delivered pain right across the community, which was proved by the diverse turn-out of protest marches. 'We had a very broad cross section of the community,' SA Unions state secretary Joe Szakacs told AAP after several thousand people marched in central Adelaide on Sunday. The protests aimed to send a message about voter dissatisfaction with the budget on the day before the new Senate sits for the first time . As well the Sydney protest, pictured, others were held across the country, including Canberra, Adelaide, Darwin and Melbourne . 'Pensioners, young people, students, working people, people with disabilities, families ... because we know that this budget attacks everybody and no-one is safe. 'Collectively now, those people are standing up.' The crowd marched from Victoria Square to Parliament House, and they called for South Australian members of the senate to oppose the budget bills. 'Many I spoke to also said this was the first time they've been to a political rally - saying they they feel angry, they feel scared, and it's time to fight back.' At the Sydney protest, Ms Milne urged incoming senators to listen to community unhappiness and block budget measures. 'You need to join with us in busting the budget,' she said. Several of the government's budget measures, including the $7 GP visit co-payment, changes to jobless benefits, a higher pension age and deregulation of university fees have been criticised as unfair. People at the rallies were from various professions including  teachers, firefighters and nurses . Union representatives were also present at many of the protests . Ms Milne said the Greens will not support the GP co-payment scheme. Treasurer Joe Hockey has said the criticism has ""drifted to the 1970s class warfare lines"" and his budget was about equal opportunity, not equality of outcome. 'Our duty is to help Australians to get to the starting line, while accepting that some will run faster than others,' he said in June. Unions NSW secretary Mark Lennon said at Sunday's protest there had not been such continuous outrage against a budget in 30 years. 'People are going to come here to [Sydney] Town Hall and make it very loud and clear what they think about what happened on May 13,' he said. Among the measures being protested today were the $7 GP visit co-payment, changes to jobless benefits, a higher pension age and deregulation of university fees .

"Unhappy: Stuart Lawrence, 35, is preparing to sue Scotland Yard for discrimination claiming he is pulled over without justification 'all the time' Stephen Lawrence's brother last night claimed police have stopped him 25 times simply because of the colour of his skin. Stuart Lawrence says he is the victim of a sustained campaign of harassment by Scotland Yard officers. And his lawyers yesterday lodged a damaging race discrimination complaint against the Metropolitan Police Service. They say the 35-year-old teacher has been repeatedly pulled over in his car for 'no apparent reason and without any justification'. His patience snapped after an incident . on November 16 near the home he shares with his fiancée and . two-year-old son in Peckham, south London. Mr Lawrence, whose brother was killed . by a racist gang, was in his VW Scirocco when two officers stopped him. After asking why he had been pulled over, he says one of the officers . replied that he had been 'naturally suspicious' of him. Mr Lawrence, whose plans to sue the . Met were revealed by the Mail on Saturday, said: 'I am being targeted . because of the colour of my skin, I don't think it's because I am . Stephen's brother. 'Whenever I have been stopped, I have . never subsequently been charged with anything, and nothing has ever been . found to be wrong with my car. 'I have never, ever, done anything . wrong. I have never been in trouble with the law. I have paid my road . tax and my insurance, and always tried to keep my cars in a roadworthy . state. 'Of the 25 or so occasions in which I . have been stopped, only two have been at police checkpoints – where they . are verifying people's tax and insurance. The rest have been random . stops.' In a statement, he added: 'There can be no other reason, apart from racism, for me being stopped so often. 'If I had no road tax, no insurance, . or if I was driving erratically, I would understand being pulled over. But on no occasions was that the case.' A letter of complaint was sent to . Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan-Howe yesterday afternoon, outlining . details of Mr Lawrence's ordeal and the names of the officers involved . in the latest incident. In it, his lawyers warn of further . legal proceedings and state that over 'many years' he has been stopped . between 20 and 25 times. Because of the extraordinary . sensitivity of the case, there is speculation that the Independent . Police Complaints Commission will be asked to supervise an inquiry into . the allegations. The legal move will be of particular . concern to Home Secretary Theresa May, who last month paid tribute to . the campaigning work of Stuart and Stephen's mother Doreen. Brothers: Stuart Lawrence (right) pictured at home with his elder sibling Stephen (left), who was murdered . Family: Murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence's mother Doreen Lawrence OBE (left) and her son Stuart (right) pictured at a memorial held in his honour in April last year . Tireless: The boys' mother Doreen Lawrence who has long campaigned  to rid the police of racism . In 1999, the Met was accused of being 'institutionally racist' by the judicial inquiry into her son's murder six years earlier. The 18-year-old A-level student was killed by a group of white youths as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London. Two of that gang, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were jailed for life last January for Stephen's murder. Mr Lawrence said last night: 'I feel . angry and frustrated because I sat through the trial of Dobson and . Norris, and saw some of the mistakes made by police in 1993 and the . years that followed. 'Now it appears not much progress has . been made in how they deal with black people. I just want police to do . their jobs properly. I don't want them to waste time on people like me. Their time could be better spent elsewhere, rather than pulling me over. Home Secretary Theresa May (left) has paid tribute to the campaigning work of Doreen Lawrence. Mr Lawrence sent a letter of complaint to Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe (right) outlining his concerns . Remembered: A police CCTV surveillance van at the site of the Stephen Lawrence memorial stone in Eltham, south-east London . 'They could be out solving crimes. A . lot of recommendations were made by the Macpherson Inquiry but it seems . that it hasn't made much difference. 'I would like to know when things are . going to change, when is there going to be a society where you are not . pulled over because you are a black guy or a black person driving a . particular car. The decision to stop someone in their car should be . based on a sound reason, rather than the colour of your skin. 'I have met some really good police officers who work hard to protect the community. 'But it only takes a small handful of . people with the wrong type of attitude to make it feel like things have . not changed since the Macpherson Inquiry.' He said that as he grew up in south . London, being regularly stopped by police was something he 'reluctantly . accepted'. 'But as I am getting older now, the circumstances in which I . am stopped are more ludicrous and more over the top,' he added. 'I saw the mistakes made by police in 1993 and the years that followed. Not much progress has been made in how they deal with black people.' Stuart Lawrence . 'In recent years, I have been stopped . during my lunch-break at work. The police were checking tax discs. I . have also been stopped on my first day back to work after the summer . holidays, which meant I was late for the first briefing meeting for . work. 'On this occasion, I was pulled over randomly just before I got to the traffic lights. 'I explained this to the officer, that . I was on my way to work, but he insisted on going through the process . of checking who I was, and checking my car was taxed, insured and in . good working order. 'I have reservations now about the type of car I can drive because I don't want to increase the amount of times I am stopped.' Mr Lawrence's solicitor Imran Khan . said:  'Stop and search is often used as a litmus test for how the . police treat those from minority ethnic communities. 'Stuart's experience shows that rather than passing this litmus test, the Metropolitan Police have remained consistently bad. 'Stuart has suffered immeasurably over . the last 20 years. First with the murder of his brother in 1993, then . the failures of the police in their investigation into the murder and to . cap it all being unfairly stopped because of his skin colour. 'Previously Stuart has not complained . or otherwise drawn attention to what has happened to him, but now, when . the Metropolitan police seemingly trumpet how things have changed for . the better, he has felt the need to take action. He has now instructed . me to use the full force of the law.' The Metropolitan Police declined to comment last night.","Stephen's brother Stuart Lawrence, 35, left furious by harassment .

"Karim Bellarabi scored the quickest goal in Bundesliga history and then set up another for Stefan Kiessling as Bayer Leverkusen stunned hosts Borussia Dortmund with a 2-0 win on Saturday evening. Bellarabi struck after only nine seconds, beating the previous quickest goals scored by Giovane Elber and Ulf Kirsten by two seconds to leave the Westfalenstadion shellshocked. He then teed up Kiessling for the second deep into second-half stoppage time with Leverkusen proving to be good value for their win in Roger Schmidt's first game in charge. Record breaker: Karim Bellarabi scored after just nine seconds against Borussia Dortmund . Off the mark: It did not take long for Bellarabi to score his side's first goal of the new Bundesliga campaign . Hannover came from behind to beat Schalke 2-1 to increase the pressure on the Royal Blues' coach Jens Keller. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar gave the visitors the lead within two minutes of the half-time interval after a dreary first 45 minutes at the Niedersachsenstadion. But two goals in three minutes from Edgar Prib and Joselu turned the game on its head, earning Hannover all three points and condemning Schalke to a second defeat in a week, after they lost to Dynamo Dresden in the first round of the DFB-Pokal.

Goalscorer: Former Real Madrid striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar gave his side the lead . Julian Schieber's fourth brace of his top-flight career was not enough to earn Hertha Berlin victory as they surrendered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Werder Bremen at the Olympiastadion. The former Borussia Dortmund forward gave the hosts what seemed to be a comfortable lead with goals in either half, but Assani Lukimya and Franco Di Santo scored two goals in as many minutes to earn Robin Dutt's men a share of the spoils. Hoffenheim began their campaign with a 2-0 win over Augsburg as Adam Szalai marked his debut with a goal before Tarik Elyounoussi added a second just two minutes later.

'He got back up, told the attendant he wanted her to move, and at that point they paged to see if there was a doctor on board.' A doctor examined the passenger, who was taken to a back row of seats that had been cleared for him.

"More than a third of new jobs in the UK have been created in London as the capital benefitted from an Olympics boost, new figures revealed today. Of the 236,000 extra people in work in the three months to July, 91,000 were in London. Unemployment numbers in London also fell by 22,000, ‘suggesting the Olympics may have added to the boost’, the Office for National Statistics said. While there has been sharp drop in unemployment in London, other regions have seen rises. Nationwide jobless total fell by 7,000 from May to July to 2.59 million, an unemployment rate of 8.1 per cent. There . was a mixed picture across the country in the level of unemployment . from May to July. In the three months in London the jobless number fell . by 22,000. In the North East the figure fell by 11,000 and in the South . West down by 9,000. But . Yorkshire/Humber saw a rise of 23,000 unemployed, in the West Midlands . the figure was up 16,000 and in Northern Ireland there was a rise of . 10,000. In . August there were 1.57 million claiming Jobseekers Allowance, down by . 15,000 on July - the largest monthly fall since June 2010. David Cameron told MPs: 'Today's unemployment figures show an extra million private sector jobs, net, since the election, which I think is something that shows our economy is rebalancing.' Today's . drop in the headline rate of unemployment was lower than many . economists were expected, but the fall in the claimant count was far . higher than forecast. While London saw a drop of 22,000 in unemployment from May to July compared to the previous quarter, other regions including Yorkshire/Humber had sharp rises . The number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance in August was 1.57 million, down by 15,000 on July. And it was not all good news for ministers. The number of people out of work for over a year is now at its highest for more than 16 years - at 904,000, up 22,000 on the previous quarter. London accounted for 5,500 of the fall in the claimant count, fuelling fears that areas outside the South East are still struggling with the effects of the double dip recession.Liam Byrne, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'When you look beneath the headlines, you can see that in half of our country, unemployment has actually gone up. 'So in three-quarters of Britain now, unemployment is higher today than it was back in May 2010.' The rise in the number of people in London in work has been linked to extra staff taken on to work in and around the Olympic Park in London. With London 2012 now over, employment minister Mark Hoban sought to play down the idea that the rise in the number of people in work was just a blip caused by the Games. He told Sky News: ‘There’s been strong performances in places like the south west, the north west, in the west midlands, so it’s a much broader picture, I think, than simply London driving these numbers forward. ‘Because the Olympics does have an effect – there are people who are employed for the Olympics in London, and that’s why next week we’re having a jobs fair where we’re inviting 2,000 people who had on the Olympics to come and meet local employers to try to find them a permanent job.’ Dave Prentis, Unison general secretary, said some parts of the country were still suffering. ‘For families suffering the misery of unemployment, any decrease will be welcome news, but it is clear when you look at the bigger economic picture that any talk of growth is premature. ‘In areas such as Yorkshire and Humberside, and the West Midlands - where unemployment is already among the highest in the UK - unemployment continues to go up, meaning yet more misery for families struggling to get by.’ The number of people working part-time but who say they want to work full time is at a new all time high of 1,424,000, the IPPR think tank said. Tony Dolphin, IPPR chief economist, said: 'Despite improvements in the overall . employment rate, long-term unemployment has hit a 16 year high remains a . serious problem, with more than 900,000 people out of work for more . than a year. 'The long-term unemployed should be offered a guaranteed job . to make sure they don’t become permanently cut off from the jobs . market.”","More than 90,000 of the 236,000 extra people now in work were in the capital .

"Germany and Russia are working on a secret peace deal to end the conflict in Ukraine that would see Moscow's controversial annexation of Crimea officially recognised in exchange for a $1billion compensation package, it was claimed today. Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin have reportedly been locked in talks that will primarily seek to ensure the Kremlin withdraws its support for rebels fighting for independence in eastern Ukraine. Putin would also have to agree not to interfere with Ukraine's new trade relations with the European Union and offer Kiev a long-term contract for future gas supplies with Russian firm Gazprom. Scroll down for video . Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin (pictured earlier this month) have reportedly been holding secret talks aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine which would see Crimea officially annexed in exchange for $1billion . In return, parts of eastern Ukraine would be granted some devolved powers and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko would abandon attempts to join Nato, a source close to the negotiations told Margareta Pagano from The Independent. A far more contentious bargaining chip would also see the international community formally acknowledging Crimea's annexation to Russia, which may prove a hard sell to some members of the United Nations, the paper reports. If agreed, Russia would be asked to pay the Ukraine $1billion in compensation for rent it used to pay for basing its navy at the port of Sevastopol before Crimea voted for independence. One insider said: 'This is Merkel's deal. She has been dealing direct with President Putin on this. The deal would call on Russia to withdraw its support for separatists who have been accused of shooting down flight MH17 and then preventing investigators from accessing the crash site (above) 'She needs to solve the dispute because . it's in no-one's interest to have tension in the Ukraine or to have . Russia out in the cold. No one wants another Cold War.' Talks have reportedly been put on ice since the shooting down of MH17 in eastern Ukraine which has been blamed on pro-Moscow rebels, but sources insist the deal is 'still on the table'. It comes as Ukraine today announced it had suspended its military offensive in the east for one day to help international experts reach the downed Malaysian airliner's crash site. Dutch and Australian police experts have been trying for five days to access the area where the remains of around 80 of the 298 people killed have been decomposing in sweltering temperatures since the crash on July 17. Police officers and military guard the Ukrainian parliament during a closed session where it agreed to stop its offensive against pro-Russian rebels for one day to allow access to the MH17 crash site . Kiev said on the Facebook website of what . it calls its 'anti-terrorist operation' (ATO) against pro-Russian . rebels that it was heeding calls by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to . stop fighting near the plane crash site. But the government claimed the separatists were continuing to attack its positions. It said: 'On July 31, troops involved in the active ATO phase are not conducting military operations apart from protecting their own positions from attack. 'But mercenary fighters of the Russian terrorists are not respecting any international agreements and requests.' The rebels have accused Kiev of blocking access to the Malaysian airliner crash site by fighting in the area.","Angela Merkel 'dealing directly with Vladimir Putin to thrash out pact'

"Firebrand Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne has described the 18-year-old man shot dead last night as a 'wonderful, practicing (sic) brother' who was 'murdered by authorities'. Police allege the teenager, since named as Numan Haider, stabbed two police officers near Endeavour Hills police station around 7:45pm last night before he was shot dead. The Perth radical, in his mid-20s, made the remarks in a Facebook post late last night. Police have said they had 'no choice' but to shoot the 'terror suspect'. Scroll down for video . Controversial figure: Mohammed Junaid Thorne made the statement last night. Thorne (left) described the 18-year-old terror suspect, since identified as Numan Haider (right), as a 'wonderful, practicing brother'. 'Murdered': The remarks made by the firebrand preacher this morning. Thorne, who has reportedly claimed to have memorised the Koran by age six, has recently made a number of controversial statements about Australia. Last Thursday, he issued a statement labelling the Australian government 'the real terrorists', following the largest ever counter-terrorism raids in the nation's history. He said the Australian government wants to 'destroy Islam by any means...closing down Islamic centres, raiding Muslim houses, arresting active Muslim youth and preachers, intimidating Muslims cancelling their passports... and creating a vibe of fear within the Australian community to make them afraid of Muslims'. In August, he posted to Facebook saying scholars who support the Islamic State terror group are 'on the front lines, in the battlefields, backing their words with actions'. He told Daily Mail Australia this morning that today was a 'time of grief for us Muslims'. His comments came as moderate Muslim leader Dr Jamal Rifi warned that the country must allow the authorities time to finish their investigations into the Tuesday night's stabbing. Justice Minister Michael Keenan praised the officers' 'bravery' and 'dedication' in a press conference on Wednesday morning. Mr Keenan said the police appeared to have acted in self-defence against a 'known terror suspect'. 'This incident occurred during a police investigation and it appears that the shooting by the police officer was in self-defence.' Victorian Premier Denis Napthine today praised the officers. He said any death is 'tragic', irrespective of the circumstances, and that his thoughts were with the family of the deceased . Police take bags of evidence away from the scene of last night's incident. A crime scene was established near the Endeavour Hills Police Station. Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the attack  as 'fierce'. In a video statement, Mr Abbott said: 'Obviously this indicates there are people in our community who are capable of very extreme acts.' The Islamic Council of Victoria has called for a 'full and objective investigation' into how the incident came about so 'such a tragedy is never repeated'. Ghaith Krayem, the organisation's Secretary, said in a statement the organisation felt 'deep sorrow' about 'last night's tragic events'. 'Events that, on face value, should not have cost a young man his life and put two police officers in hospital. 'Our focus, at this time, is on supporting the family of the young man; ensuring that their needs are catered for.' Mr Krayem said the incident showed the 'real cost of a failure to deal with these serious issues which is why we have made numerous calls on the Australian government to deal with the root causes of alienation and disaffection of people such as this.'

"An account manager who survived a 100ft fall off a cliff while on a stag do at the weekend has revealed he has escaped death on four other occasions. Garrey Ashton, 44, from Frimley, suffered only cuts, bruises and a trapped nerve in his neck after plunging 100ft over a sheer cliff in Cornwall on Saturday 13. At the time a hotel worker told him he was lucky to be alive, but Mr Ashton has since explained the accident was actually his fifth brush with death. Garrey Ashton, 44, suffered only cuts, bruises and a trapped nerve in his neck after falling 100ft over a cliff. He has since revealed he has also survived being run over twice, breaking his neck, and being electrocuted . Mr Ashton said: 'I have been run over twice. The first time was when I was 12 doing a paper round in Frimley. I was going down Balmoral Drive. 1) Hit by a car while doing a paper round aged 12, received only a few bruises . 2) Aged 14, hit by a car again while crossing the road after visiting a friendin hospital . 3) Broke vertebrae in his neck while working on the back of a lorry in 1990 . 4) Received an electric shock at home while replacing back of a plug and accidentally touched the prongs . 5) Fell 100ft over a cliff in Cornwall while on a stag do. Suffered cuts, bruises and a trapped nerve in his neck . 'I hit the brakes [on my bike] on the way down and a car hit me. I didn't suffer any injuries, just a few bruises. 'The second time was when I was 14. At school, a friend was taken to hospital because he had broken his arm. 'When he was discharged from Frimley Park, I wanted to get home for my tea. I pressed the traffic lights button and just ran across the road and was run down. 'In 1990, I was working on the back of a lorry when I broke a vertebrae in my neck. The other brush I had was when I got an electric shock when the back came off a plug and I touched the prongs . His latest close shave came after he travelled to Newquay last Friday to attend cousin Lewis Ashton’s engagement party . Mr Ashton, from Frimely, Surrey, was drinking with the group until around midnight, when he left in order to help a disabled member of the party back to the hotel. After seeing his friend home safe, he headed back out to rejoin the party at around 12.30am. Mr Ashton was knocked unconscious as he fell from this cliff at 12.30am, and woke up at the bottom at 5am when the tide began lapping at his feet . He said: 'We weren’t going crazy. It was the first night, we were pacing ourselves. The lads knew that I’d gone back to the hotel quickly. 'Walking back, I heard the sea. We had all pledged we’d jump in at some stage over the weekend so I thought I’d take a quick look down, but it was pretty dark. 'I stepped over maybe a 3ft fence, but then I slipped on the gravel in the dark. I started sliding - I could see the edge lit up by the moonlight and it was then I just knew that I was going over.' Mr Ashton said the fall knocked him unconscious, and he only woke up four hours later. He added: 'I woke up at around 5am with the tide lapping at my feet. I’d lost my shoes at some stage. The last thing that I recall was the sound of the wind in my ears getting louder and louder as I fell. 'My first thought was simply ""Blimey, I’m alive!"". I was in total shock. I didn’t feel any pain.' Mr Ashton then fought his way through brambles and nettles back up to the cliff top, where he joined his friends in the hotel for a fry-up breakfast. 'My mates found me and said, ""what the hell happened to you last night?"", so I just told them - I fell off the cliff,' he said. 'After a few laughs, they got me in an ambulance and sent me off to hospital.' 'The paramedics took a look at the cliff and said it must have been an 80ft-100ft drop. It was absolutely sheer. I didn’t tumble down - I fell down freely. 'A girl from the hotel, Ali, came along with me to the hospital and told me the cliff I fell from was a notorious black spot and that four or five people had died there in the past.' Mr Ashton was treated for cuts and bruises in Cornwall, and when he arrived back in Surrey, a CT scan revealed he had a trapped nerve in his neck, but was otherwise unhurt. He added: 'It was only supposed to be a little trip to the beach - I just took a bit of a shortcut. Anyone who knows me knows I’m a bit clumsy. I guess it was a pretty typical stag do overall!'","Garrey Ashton, 44, looking over cliff in Cornwall when he slipped on gravel .

"A Florida woman who tried to shoot a snake with a borrowed gun at a Pop Warner football practice was arrested Monday for discharging a weapon on school grounds. April DeMarco, 30, was watching a football practice at Bay High School field when coaches discovered what was described as a water moccasin on the field and ordered the kids to leave. The Panama City News Herald reports as coaches tried to whack the snake with sticks, Miren Gregory, 31, told DeMarco she had a concealed carry permit and had her handgun with her. Shooter: April DeMarco borrowed a gun from a parent carrying at a Pop Warner football practice and fired at a snake on the field . As DeMarco took the .380-caliber pistol and lined up to take the shot, another parent warned her it was against the law to have a weapon on school property, DeMarco replied: 'I will take the blame.' With children 20 to 50 yards away, DeMarco squeeze off one shot at the snake and missed. DeMarco later admitted to police she was carrying a weapon on school property and shot the snake to protect the children, justifying it because she was a mother. She was arrested Monday discharging a firearm on school property and possession of a firearm on school property. Gregory was arrested a day later on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and possession of a firearm on school property. Parents: Miren Gregory (center), 31, told DeMarco she had a concealed carry license before handing over the firearm used to shoot at the snake . Deadly: A water moccasin's bite can be fatal for individuals with a smaller body mass, though it is often confused with other non-poisonous snakes . Concealed carry permit holders are prohibited in Florida from bringing weapons onto school grounds except during school-sanctioned events directly related to those weapons. Police had no word on what became of the snake.","April DeMarco, 30, was watching a football practice at a high school in Panama City when a snake described as a water moccasin was discovered .

"The contrast between this video and earlier Islamic State propaganda could hardly be greater. Until John Cantlie’s appearance yesterday, the IS videos had shown a series of horrific beheadings. These included the last moments of UK aid worker David Haines and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Each video ended with a chilling picture of the next hostage facing death. The victims were wearing orange jumpsuits, kneeling in the sand, with blue sky behind them. The knife-wielding figure of the British fanatic known as Jihadi John was seen next to them as he ranted about Barack Obama and David Cameron. Yesterday’s video has no knives, no threats and no beheading. It was equally slick in production but a total contrast in style, almost like a parody of a US TV chat show – though still burdened with menace. Contrast: Yesterday’s video has no knives, no threats and no beheading. It was equally slick in production but a total contrast in style, almost like a parody of a US TV chat show . Reference from A Beatles song? Titles at the opening of the video declare ‘Lend Me Your Ears – message from British detainee John Cantlie.’ The choice of the phrase ‘Lend Me Your Ears’ could be significant one. It was used in the Beatles song With A Little Help From My Friends and could be seen as a twisted reference to the fact that the British captors responsible for the beheadings are said to be known as The Beatles. If so, it could be an attempt to poke fun at the Western media and a signal that they are aware of, even enjoying, their own infamy. There is a further interpretation, however. The phrase was coined by Shakespeare in Julius Caesar, where it opens a speech by Mark Anthony – a man who has been forced to speak words he does not believe in – but ultimately manages to convert a crowd to what he truly thinks. The scenario could be compared to that of Cantlie, who is being forced – in his words, with ‘a gun to his head’ – to speak words he presumably does not really believe. No clues in 'TV studio' setting . Cantlie is shown in the opening shot sitting indoors at a polished wooden table, his hands folded in front of him. Unlike the previous videos where the ground and background have provided analysts with clues as to where it is, the images have been stripped of anything that could provide help to those wishing to find the hostages. For a man facing execution, the Briton appears remarkably calm, his words clearly spoken. Introducing ‘the detainee’ Cantlie is not wearing the distinctive orange jumpsuits seen on his fellow captives – in a mocking imitation of those the Americans made terror suspects wear in Guantanamo Bay. Instead he is shown in a loose-fitting, round-neck orange top with elbow length sleeves. Significantly, the word ‘Detainee’ is used on screen in English and then Arabic to describe the photographer. He is markedly thinner than when last pictured shortly after crossing the border back in the Syria from Turkey in November 2012. His hair has been cropped short and he has a relatively well-kept beard and moustache. His hands show no scars and his fingernails appear cut and clean. There are no signs of the beatings many of the hostages have endured. Deliberate? The line Lend Me Your Ears was used in a Beatles song  and could be seen as a twisted reference to the fact that the British captors responsible for the beheadings are said to be known as The Beatles . Was he using an autocue? Throughout the slick 3.21 minute video, posted on YouTube, the Briton appears to be reading from an autocue. The speech was almost certainly written for him. While he often uses his hands like a TV reporter to emphasise a point – once putting his fingers to his head mimicking a gun – his eyes rarely wander from the screen in front of him. It is a method IS had used successfully on the previous videos, especially when Mr Haines, 44, read a script fiercely criticising Mr Cameron shortly before the former RAF engineer was killed. Sometimes, the camera zooms in close to Cantlie’s face, before pulling back to a wider, rounded frame. It seems at least two cameras are used – indicating a level of sophistication in the production. Hello, My name is John Cantlie . Speaking calmly and clearly, he begins : ‘Hello, my name is John Cantlie. I’m a British journalist who used to work for some of the bigger newspapers and magazines in the UK, including the Sunday Times, The Sun, and The Sunday Telegraph. ‘In November 2012 I came to Syria, where I was subsequently captured by the Islamic State. Now, nearly two years later, many things have changed, including the expansion of the Islamic State to include large areas of Eastern Syria and Western Iraq – a land mass bigger than Britain, and many other nations.’ Introduction: Speaking calmly and clearly, he begins : ‘Hello, my name is John Cantlie. I’m a British journalist who used to work for some of the bigger newspapers and magazines in the UK . Government’s abandoned me . Unclasping his hands he continues: ‘Now, I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking: “he’s only doing this because he’s a prisoner he’s got a gun at his head and he’s being forced to do this,” right? Well, it’s true. ‘I am a prisoner, that I cannot deny. But seeing as I’ve been abandoned by my government and my fate now lies in the hand of the Islamic State I have nothing to lose. Maybe I will live and maybe I will die, but I want to take this opportunity to convey some facts that you can verify, facts that if you contemplate might help in preserving lives.’ I’ll be back with more messages . Cantlie’s voice remains clear and a constant tone as he unveils the video is the first of several planned by IS. He said : ‘Over the next few programmes I’m going to show you the truth as the Western media tries to drag the public back to the abyss of another war with the Islamic State. After two disastrous and hugely unpopular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq why is it that our governments appear so keen to get involved in yet another unwinnable conflict?’ More messages: Although Mr Cantlie does not refer to it directly, he suggests he will reveal the ‘truth’ about why the British and American hostages were murdered . You think you’re told the truth? As Cantlie winds-up his speech, he stresses : ‘I’m going to show you the truth behind the systems and motivation of the Islamic State, and how the Western media – the very organisation I used to work – for can twist and manipulate that truth for the public back home. There are two sides to every story. Think you’re getting the whole picture?’ And although he does not refer to it directly, he suggests he will reveal the ‘truth’ about why the British and American hostages were murdered – suggesting it is the fault of British and American governments for not paying ransoms. ‘And I’ll show you the truth behind what happened when many European citizens were imprisoned and later released by the Islamic State, and how the British and American governments thought they could do it differently to every other European country,’ he says. ‘They negotiated with the Islamic State and got their people home, while the British and Americans were left behind.’ A warning to chill the blood . Cantlie’s chilling conclusion was remarked upon for its use of the word ‘head’ which some saw as a veiled reference to the threat of beheading hanging over the other hostages including Alan Henning. He concludes : ‘It’s very alarming to see where this is all headed and it looks like history repeating itself, yet again.’ But he suggests that the public can ‘change’ the course of events – though it is not clear how. ‘There is time to change this seemingly inevitable sequence of events, but only if you, the public act now,’ he says. ‘Join me for the next few programmes, and I think you may be surprised at what you learn.’ The screen then turns to black.","Recent Islamic State videos had shown a series of horrific beheadings .

"Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence. The search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans. One of its founders warned artificial intelligence is  'number 1 risk for this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction. An analyst believes Google is in the best position to create the first ever conscious machine and already has related projects in the place.

Kurzweil . has famously claimed that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to . upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - . an event called singularity. He also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100. 'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent interview. Among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. 'Google has agreed to establish an ethics board to ensure the artificial intelligence technology isn't abused, according to two people familiar with the deal,' said The Information, which revealed the news. The DeepMind-Google ethics board is set to create a series of rules and restrictions over the use of the technology. The purchase of Deep Mind saw a comprehensive school-educated computer genius has become a multi-millionaire overnight after selling his company to Google. Neuroscientist Demis Hassabis, 37, co-founded DeepMind Technologies just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. His company has yet to produce anything commercially but Google has still paid £242million for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence. It represents Google’s biggest ever single acquisition in Europe. The acquisition by the Californian-based giant is the biggest single purchase in Europe. DeepMind specialises in 'machine learning' designing computers that can learn from their mistakes . Mr Hassabis told MailOnline: 'We’re really excited to be joining Google. 'This . partnership will allow us to turbo-charge our mission to harness the . power of machine learning tools to tackle some of society’s toughest . problems, and help make our everyday lives more productive and . enjoyable.' The website . states DeepMind uses ‘the best techniques from machine learning and . systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning . algorithms.’ A friend of Mr Hassabis said: ‘He has very forward-looking ideas and can spot where industries are heading in the future.’ Programmes . that predict the way people think and can even teach computers to think . for themselves are set to be the next big breakthrough in technology. It . is believed Facebook had been interested in buying London-based . DeepMind Technologies, which employs 75 people, but Google has now . stolen a march on its rival. Demis Hassabis, 27 . Neuroscientist Demis Hassabis, 37, co-founded DeepMind Technologies just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. He set up DeepMind with two other entrepreneurs, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman.

Mr Hassabis grew up in Hendon, north London. At the age of four, he saw . his father, a Greek-Cypriot entrepreneur, playing chess and asked to be . taught the rules. Within weeks, he was beating his father. A couple of . years later he was programming computers. He . took his A-levels early at just 15 and says his local comprehensive . kept him on a ‘light rein’ which enabled him to develop his other . interests. He went on to Cambridge University where he graduated with a . double first in computer science. He set up . DeepMind with two other entrepreneurs, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. The business also counted Founders Fund, the venture firm started by . Facebook backer Peter Thiel, as an investor. They will share in the . £242million windfall. This latest acquisition follows Google's recent purchase of seven robotics firms, including Meka, which makes humanoid robots, and Industrial Perception, which specialises in machines that can package goods and load up lorries, for example. However, instead of being used in the robotics division, it is more likely DeepMind, and its expertise, will be used to improve Google's current technologies - including voice and text search.

"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will review its rules about ivory imports after two New Hampshire teenagers had their bagpipes seized at the Canadian border, a spokesman said Friday. The spokesman, Neil Mendelsohn, said customs agents at the Highgate Springs, Vermont, border crossing were following established laws designed to prevent the import and export of illegally harvested ivory when they seized the pipes. Campbell Webster and Eryk Bean, a pair of 17-year-olds who compete on an international level, had their pipes taken. Campbell Webster's pipes date to 1936 and were played by his father (Campbell pictured) Ivory harvested since 1976 is banned in the U.S. 'Our headquarters is examining this and looking at the policy and the regulations understanding that musicians do have a unique situation,' Mendelsohn said. 'And we try to be reasonable, but for right now the rules are the rules. Any instrument these days could be made from elephant parts that might not be an antique.' The discord started Sunday when Campbell and Eryk were driving back from Canada after a competition that served as a tuneup for next weekend's World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. Campbell's pipes date to 1936 and were played by his father, Gordon Webster, who was the 9th Sovereign Piper to Queen Elizabeth II of England. Eryk Bean (pictured) also had his bagpipes confiscated at the Vermont/Canadian border . Because Highgate Springs is a 'nondesignated' crossing, they needed extra permits and inspection fees totaling $576 to carry the pipes, with their ivory projecting mounts, across the border. They didn't have the paperwork and the pipes were confiscated for a day. The boys eventually got their pipes back and are in Glasgow, where their adventure has been the talk of the competition, Campbell's mother, Lezlie, said Friday. 'It's about time they think about (amending the rules),' she said. 'We are not exporters. We are not importers. We are just carrying it on our person and playing music.' Mendelsohn said the added fees at nondesignated crossings are needed to recoup the expense of inspections at the border. He maintains that the musicians knew the rules beforehand, though Lezlie Webster disputes that. There are no 'designated' land crossings in the Northeast; the nearest designated crossing is Boston's Logan Airport, meaning to avoid the extra fees and paperwork, they'd have to fly to Canada.","Campbell Webster and Eryk Bean, 17, had their bagpipes seized at Canadian border .

"A retired vet kept his collies in such disgusting squalor that when police opened his front door they barely recognised the animals as dogs and almost vomited. Officers from the police and RSPCA were forced to put on gas masks as they entered the house owned by Charles John Spicer to rescue two collies called Puppy and Little Boy. They had been called to the house after neighbours raised concern and when they were unable to raise the 72-year-old, they used fire brigade ladders to look into an upstairs window. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Officers from the police and RSPCA rescue Puppy, one of Spicer's dogs who was found to be living in squalor . They also rescued Little Boy, pictured, who was found to have a severe case of mange . When they finally entered the home in Gobowen, Shropshire they found the property piled high with rubbish and the dogs lying on a flithy floor . They then discovered Puppy under bags of rubbish with so little hair, she was barely recognisable as a dog. When vets checked the dog it was found that she had three slipped discs, a ruptured cruciate ligament and a skin condition so bad, she had to be put down shortly after. The second dog, Little Boy, was found to be suffering from severe mange, a parasitic disease caused by mites. Yesterday at Shrewsbury Magistrates Court, Spicer was found guilty of two counts two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and one of not providing veterinary attention to an animal. Police officers then arrested Spicer for animal cruelty, which has led to him being banned from keeping animals . On entering the house, officers said they saw rubbish piled as high as the ceilings making them almost vomit. They found dog, Little Boy, pictured under some of the waste . He was banned from keeping animals for ten years. The court also heard how Spicer had attempted to treat his dogs using drugs meant for humans and admitted he would scavenge for medication. Spicer admitted to JPs that he had used human drugs on the dog as well as Vitamin A, zinc and aspirin. Officers were called to Spicer's house, left, where they found the dogs. Puppy, left, had to be carried from the house on a stretcher . He even gave one dog a marine supplement because he said as a Great Dane cross breed its ancestors would have eaten a lot of fish. Paul Taylor, prosecuting, told the court: 'He believed the dog needed fish treatment because of its Norwegian original. It was be almost comical had not the dog been in excruciating pain.' But the former vet told the court what he gave the dog was still 'the right treatment'. The pets were in such a poor condition when rescued that officers said they were barely recognisable as dogs . Spicer said: 'Aspirin is more than adequate as an anti inflammatory. 'I believe many treatments are destructive rather than constructive. Retired vet Charles John Spicer at Shrewsbury Magistrates Court, where he was banned from keeping animals for ten years . 'I am not happy that the dog looked like it did - it was repugnant to me. However, people do not know how agonising it can be to asses a dog’s condition from day to day.' Earlier Sergeant Ed Bates told the court how he knocked on the door of Spicer’s house several times, found it wasn’t locked but could not raise him. He called out the fire service to put a ladder up to the bedroom window but there was no sign of him. 'I was worried for his welfare so decided to go into the house. 'It was piled high with bags of rubbish and the stench was disgusting so we put masks on. 'We lifted up some bags and found a dog lying in the doorway. It was a shocking sight.” The two officers went further into the house. 'There was dirt and filth and the house was hopping with fleas. We crawled on our hands and knees over bags of rubbish with our torches. 'I wanted to vomit, the smell was so overpowering.' Speaking after the case, Inspector Vicki Taylor, from the RSPCA, said: 'It is very sad in this case that an animal suffered in a way which could have been prevented.' A fourth charge of failing to ensure that dog was protected from suffering was withdrawn.","Charles John Spicer kept his collies in squalid conditions at his home .

"Luis Suarez told FIFA's disciplinary panel that he did not deliberately bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. Meanwhile, football's international governing body have been formally informed of an appeal against Suarez's ban. The Uruguay football federation will now have a further seven days to prepare the paperwork for the appeal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Spirit of Suarez lives on as Uruguay fans wear Luis masks . Accident? Luis Suarez told FIFA he did not deliberately bite Giorgio Chiellini but fell on top of him . Big miss: FIFA have been formally informed of Uruguay's appeal against Suarez's ban . About time: Suarez has delayed his apology to Chiellini but has promised he will never behave like that again . FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro: 'We have received a declaration that they are planning to appeal. They informed us of their intention to appeal yesterday (Friday) evening. 'The reasons for the appeal must now be given in writing within a deadline of seven days after the three days has expired.' Last Wednesday, Suarez wrote a letter to the FIFA panel and said: 'In no way it happened how you have described, as a bite or intent to bite.' 'After the impact ... I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent,' Suarez wrote in his submission to the panel which met on Wednesday, one day after Uruguay beat Italy 1-0 in a decisive group-stage match. 'At that moment I hit my face against the player leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth,' Suarez said. However, the seven-man panel dismissed the argument. Painful: Suarez fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back Chiellini . FIFA suggested the punishment was so hefty because Suarez failed to show any hint of remorse for his actions. 'At no time did the player show any kind of remorse or admit to any violation of FIFA rules and therefore showed no awareness of having committed any infraction,' a FIFA document said, as reported by Brazilian newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo. 'The minimum punishment was not sufficient to have the necessary dissuasive effect. 'Previous bans did not have an effect.' Evidence: Chiellini looked outraged as he showed the referee the apparent point of impact on his shoulder . Suarez took to Twitter on Saturday to thank his supporters and said: 'Hi all, I write this post to give thanks to the outpouring of support and love I am receiving. 'Both myself and my family really appreciate it. Thank you very much for being by my side and I want all my colleagues today to know we support seleccion for the match against Colombia.' The bite was 'deliberate, intentional and without provocation,' the ruling stated in paragraph 26 of the panel's conclusions. Suarez was banned from all football activities for four months and suspended for Uruguay's next nine fixtures. He was also fined. The panel, chaired by former Switzerland international Claudio Sulser, included members from the Cook Islands, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Panama, South Africa and Singapore. The ruling confirmed that referee Marco Rodriguez of Mexico acknowledged in his match report that he missed Suarez's bite. So did his two assistants and the fourth official. 'I haven't seen the incident because the ball was in another sector of the pitch,' Rodriguez wrote in paragraph 4 of his witness submission in the 11-page document. On Saturday, Uruguay's WAGs posed with banners showing messages of support for the Liverpool frontman who has now returned to his home country.

"A squalid rat-infested home that had an estimated 40 years’ worth of waste crammed inside as high as the ceilings has been discovered, taking a team of six people a month to clear. The authorities were alerted to the state of the privately owned home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, by a neighbour who had noticed rats entering her home from the adjoining property. Once inside the house, dubbed a 'DIY landfill site' they found rotting rubbish and food packaging, which took a month to clear with the team working every day to clean up the waste under a warrant issued by Grimsby Magistrates’ Court under the Public Health Act 1936. The inside of the home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, which had an estimated 144 tonnes of waste inside, some of which had been there for more than 40 years . The authorities were alerted to the state of the privately owned home by a neighbour who had noticed rats entering her home from the adjoining property . The mammoth clearing operation, which began in August, saw 144 tonnes of waste removed - roughly the same weight as a blue whale or a small jumbo jet. John Waite from North East Lincolnshire Council Community Pride said day-to-day waste including food packaging had begun to decompose after an estimated 30 or 40 years. He said the waste gave off a 'tremendous heat' and that the foundations left below the property had started to decay, needing substantial work to repair them. Inside the overgrown garden of the property were two vehicles, one was hidden in weeds, the other , a 4x4 that was used a dump, while inside the house rubbish was piled as high as the ceiling in some rooms. Maggots and rats had 'infiltrated' neighbouring properties and the gas meter, installed in 2007, had never been used. Neighbours, who identified the occupier of the house as a single elderly man, were shocked to hear about the squalor next door and claim the occupant is usually smartly dressed but his messy home is obscured by a large hedge. The mammoth clearing operation, which began in August, saw a team of six people work to clean up the house, which had been occupied by a retired accountant in his 70s . Maggots and rats had 'infiltrated' neighbouring properties due to the amount of waste piled up inside and the gas meter, installed in 2007, had never been used . One neighbour, who would not be named, said the occupant, a retired accountant in his seventies, had lived in the house for at least 40 years. He said: 'He is a very private man and I am shocked because he always dresses well and would always stop to tip his hat and exchange pleasantries in the street. We had no idea what was going on. It is very sad.' Another neighbour, who would not be named, added: 'He bought the six cats recently to help with the rats and mice.' Meanwhile Mr Waite described the inside of the house as 'putrid' and that there had been moves to clear the house without the intervention of the council. He said: 'There were thorough enquiries made and attempts to resolve it with authority intervention but sadly those attempts failed and the authority had no choice but to serve a notice under the Public Health Act. 'We obtained a warrant from Grimsby Magistrates’ Court to enter the grounds and the property for the purpose of removing filthy and verminous items. The owner-occupier is currently being cared for by partner agencies. A warrant was issued by Grimsby Magistrates’ Court under the Public Health Act 1936 to enter the house, which gave off a 'tremendous heat' due to the waste inside . 'It’s putrid. There’s decomposed rubbish. It’s day-to-day (waste) that the owner hasn't cleared and then it has started to decompose. 'The team had to clear the outside and that took a number of days just to get to the front door to enter. Only then was it safe to commence the operation. 'Everything that comes out has to be logged. It’s likely that it won’t be habitable for some considerable time. 'A situation like that is not good for the occupier but also surrounding residents and whilst we accept that everyone is entitled to a lifestyle, when that starts to impact on adjoining properties – which it did in this case – we must intervene,' he added. A council spokesperson said: 'The works to clear the house have now been completed and a full survey has been undertaken to assess all requirements to bring the property back to a lawful, habitable condition. This will, of course, take time. 'Pest control, in and around the boundaries, will take place over the next two weeks.' According to the local council, the foundations are beginning to decay below the property, which now needs substantial work to bring it back up to standard . Concerns were also raised about the health of a number of cats belonging to the owner and were living in the house but the local council say they are being cared for on a daily basis . Concerns were also raised about the health of a number of cats belonging to the owner of the house. The council added: 'The cats belong to the owner occupier and will be removed into the care of a personal friend during all further works. 'We have no concerns relating to their current condition or ongoing care and they have been fed and watered on a daily basis.' A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: 'The cats have not been abandoned and are being attended to. 'We are also in touch with other agencies who are also attending the property regularly.'","Authorities were alerted to the state of the property in Cleethorpes after a neighbour noticed rats entering her home .

"The Premier League could host a round of games abroad in the future. Plans for an overseas set of matches are in an embryonic stage, but would appeal to the English top-flight’s huge global audience. Any chance to boost revenue from abroad would be met with support from the clubs, while the crowd of 51,014 that attended Manchester United’s pre-season clash with Liverpool in Miami, after 109,318 saw United beat Real Madrid in Michigan, will encourage League chiefs.

"Ever spotted that friend who constantly moans and complains about their life on Facebook? Worryingly, research suggests that those who describe themselves as lonely or depressed are more likely to share personal information. This includes details such as their favourite book or film to their relationship status and even their home address. A study by researchers at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia suggests that users who describe themselves as 'lonely' or 'depressed' on Facebook are more likely to share detailed personal information than those who are considered 'connected' In total 616 female Facebook users were profiled by scientists at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia. Facebook came under fire last year for allowing teenagers to make public posts. Before the update Facebook prevented under 18s making posts public; the widest audience they could reach was Friends of Friends. In . a blog post in October, Facebook said: 'Teens are among the savviest . people using social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, . activism, or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard. 'So, starting today, people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on Facebook.' According to the researchers, ‘half (308) were categorised as “connected” and the remaining 308 users were categorised as “lonely”; based on clearly stating this feeling in their latest wall posting.’ The study then monitored the publicly available aspects of the profile to see if there was a relationship between loneliness and self-disclosure. ‘The results of this study have shown that more “lonely” people disclosed their personal information, relationship information and address than “connected” people,’ write the researchers. In fact, a huge 98 per cent of the users who described themselves as lonely listed their relationship status publicly. Some even shared their home address. 79 per cent of lonely users, meanwhile, disclosed other personal details such as their favourite film and book, compared to less than 65 per cent of connected users. ‘It makes sense that the people who felt lonely would disclose this type of information,’ co-author of the study Dr Yeslam Al-Saggaf tells Market Watch. ‘They want to make it easier for others to initiate contact with them, which may help them overcome their feelings of loneliness.’ There have been several previous studies linking Facebook with depression. In September 2013, for example, it was found that online social media contributes to loneliness and reduces overall life-satisfaction, rather than making us feel connected . This is just one of several studies linking Facebook with depression or loneliness. In September 2013, a study from the University of Michigan psychologist Dr Ethan Cross showed how online social media, rather than making us feel connected, contributes to loneliness and reduces overall life-satisfaction. According to the study, the technology is having a fundamentally negative effect on the way we interact with others, and the way we perceive ourselves. The study's 82 participants were text messaged five times a day over a two-week period with a link to an online survey about their Facebook use, their feelings of well-being and the amount of face-to-face social interaction they had engaged in. Kross and his team discovered that the more time participants had spent on Facebook, the less happy they felt over time. 'The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them; the more they used Facebook over two weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time,' reported the study.","Australian researchers studied the profiles of 608 female Facebook users .

"They told John Cantlie he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He almost always was. In the days that followed the photojournalist’s first capture in Syria two years ago he was tortured and tormented by threats of beheading as his captors – British Islamic extremists – sharpened their knives in front of him. The one opportunity he had to escape (it was every Englishman’s duty to try, he later explained) ended in near disaster when he and a fellow prisoner were shot and wounded, escaping death by inches. So you might have expected the much-travelled photographer, who by then had turned 40, to never go back after he was rescued by the Free Syrian Army. Taste for adventure: John Cantlie, pictured in 2012, kept returning to war-torn regions, despite the danger . But that wasn’t in John Cantlie’s nature. ‘I’m itching to get back out there,’ he said soon after returning to the UK. ‘This is what I do.’ So he returned and in November 2012, he was captured again. Cantlie, whose family includes a doctor, army officers and a barrister, has always had a passion for adventure. His lifelong love of motorcycles led him to become a companion to Princes William and Harry, riding with them across Africa six years ago, and he has reported from some of the most dangerous places in the world. At the age of 20, it wasn’t war zones that beckoned the young Cantlie, but computer games. He cut his teeth on computer game magazines in the early 1990s, when Sega was the must-have entertainment. He moved to a motorcycle magazine before being asked to help relaunch lads’ magazine FHM. TV work and more bike magazine jobs followed before he decided he wanted to taste more action. Daring: In an interview after his return to the UK, Mr Cantlie said that he was 'itching' to return to Syria . One fellow photographer said: ‘He wasn’t the kind of guy everybody knew. He seemed to like to work on his own, be his own boss. When they released that first picture of him after he was freed … there were only a couple of photographers I knew from national newspapers who recognised him.’ Perhaps it was because Cantlie preferred freelancing to being tied to working as a staff photographer. He could boast an impressive list of publications and TV outlets that commissioned or used his work, including the Sunday Times, Sunday Telegraph, Sun, Guardian and BBC. One of his major published despatches from a war zone came in 2010 when the Sunday Times ran a story headlined ‘Dodging the bombs in a Kevlar coffin’, a reference to his journey on of Afghanistan’s most notoriously dangerous roads in an armoured vehicle, with a US infantry battalion. Captured: Mr Cantlie, who returned to Syria in 2012, is now being held hostage by Islamic State militants . It must have seemed a holiday a few months later when he joined Olympic athletes training for the Games. Two months later, he was back in the desert. On July 19, 2012, he crossed into Syria from Turkey. He and Dutch journalist Jeroen Oerlemans, walked into a rebel camp and identified themselves, expecting to be welcomed. It took Cantlie only a split second to realise they were in big trouble. The camp was run by jihadists, many British, with links to al-Qaeda. It was seven harrowing days, during which both men came to believe they would be executed, before they were freed by Syrian opposition fighters.","John Cantlie was tortured when he first captured in Syria two years ago .

Draped in a Union flag, Amy Richards, 28, of Stoke Newington, north London, said she felt lucky to be part of the Olympics. 'They said there were two billion applications for some of the tickets in the stadium,' she said. 'It was unbelievable. The noise, the flags, the excitement - even the sun's come out.'It's been an amazing day, absolutely amazing.' She sent the Olympic stadium . into raptures yesterday with Act One of a stellar heptathlon performance . – then she got set for gold. Ennis brought a capacity crowd to its feet with a . sensational start to the athletics, setting a British record in the . event for the 100-metre hurdles. At . one stage she was conducting applause from the track by raising her . arms and turning 360 degrees around the vast Olympic stadium, creating . the most electrifying atmosphere it has seen so far. Go girl! Go Jess!’ they bellowed, chanting ‘En-nis! En-nis!’ until it reached a crescendo. But the Sheffield-born champion was . rendered ‘speechless’ when she saw her 12.54 second record for the . 100-metre hurdles flash up on the scoreboard – a lifetime best, and . equal to the gold medal winning time in the women’s hurdles in Beijing. The . amazing performance propelled her instantly to the top of the leader . board, precisely the kind of start she needed. And still the crowd . cheered. Composed: After a shaky start Ennis celebrates after her second jump in the women's heptathlon Group B long jump event . Jubilant: Ennis had been in trouble with a first round jump of 5.95m, significantly down on her rival Tatyana Chernova's 6.54m. But she managed   6.40m in the second round and 6.48m in the third . ‘Show us yer . abs!’, a lone voice demanded as she took off her tracksuit for the high . jump. (The 2012 poster girl has come to be known as the Ab Fab pin-up . because of her enviable six-pack abdominal muscles and torso, repeatedly . grandstanded yesterday to the delight of front-row spectators). Sometimes . the crowd cranked up the volume so much it drowned out the names of the . athletes as they were announced on loudspeakers. When they clapped and . stamped their feet, it vibrated all through the stands. It . just blew me away to be honest,’ Ennis said afterwards. ‘How much they . got behind me was amazing. You try and prepare yourself but it’s nothing . like you can imagine. It was a great start to the day.’ Will there be joy on Super Saturday? Jessica Ennis raises her arms in celebration after finishing the 200-metre race in the heptathlon competition yesterday . Event four: Jessica Ennis claims a personal best in the 200m to put her back in the driving seat for heptathlon gold . Thumbs up: Ennis is leading the way in the heptathlon after the first day of action at the Olympic Stadium . The athletics were conducted in breaks between a loudspeaker soundtrack that blared out hits from the Rolling Stones and David Bowie, among others – plus Bob Marley’s Sun is Shining when it pelted with rain for a few minutes, flooding uncovered areas in the stands and drenching lower-tier spectators in their seats. Barely a single empty seat could be spotted inside the stadium when Ennis and her team-mates were in the arena. Her parents Vinnie Ennis and Alison Powell were here – waving a Union Flag and cheering their daughter towards victory at every stage. ‘This is her dream,’ they said – then spoke of their hopes that she will achieve her ambition to win gold in front of a home crowd. High hopes: Jessica Ennis fell slightly behind . in the heptathlon after a disappointing shot put, but is expected to . claw back some ground in the 200m . Jumping for victory: Jessica Ennis during the Women's Heptathlon High Jump at the Olympic Stadium . She has dreamed about this for so long,’ Miss Powell said. ‘It has been a long wait, and she has worked very hard.’ Elsewhere, crowds gathered at a giant screen in the Olympic Park, the Stratford equivalent of Wimbledon’s Murray Mount. There was another in Sheffield’s Don Valley stadium, where she first ran as a 13-year-old. Her secondary school hosted a final ‘good luck’ celebration, and the city council appeared to have contingency plans to cope with a chaotic homecoming if she returns triumphant. On the internet, Facebook mentions of ‘Ennis’ increased 600-fold around the time she chalked up her first stunning result. But it meant Ennis, who was absent from Beijing four years ago through injury, is now under intense pressure to come up with a gold. Uniquely in the public mind, and possibly in her own, winning mere silver would be regarded as failure. Tony Minichiello, her coach since childhood, said she was probably the only person in the British track-and-field team who, if she fails to win gold, it would be viewed as a loss.","Team GB poster girl delivers Great Britain's TWELFTH gold of the Games .

"Comedy actor Kris Marshall has been banned from driving for six months after he admitted dodging a breath test. Police found the 38-year-old asleep in his Jaguar in a Tesco car park near his home following a night out drinking. He was arrested on suspicion of being drunk in charge of a vehicle after police spotted a key in the car's ignition. Actor Kris Marshall, pictured today arriving at South Somerset Magistrates Court in Yeovil with his lawyer (right) and an unknown woman. He has been banned from driving for six months . The Tesco car park in Wells, Somerset, where police found Marshall sleeping in his Jaguar . But Marshall – known for his roles in . sitcom My Family and the BT adverts – thought he was being responsible . by sleeping in the car rather than driving home and was annoyed at being . arrested, magistrates heard. He decided to 'avoid giving a . specimen' and failed to seal his lips properly around a breathalyser . during an 'official' test at a police station. Five breath test readings taken . beforehand ranged from 56 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of . breath to 67 micrograms – nearly twice the limit. Yesterday at South Somerset . Magistrates Court, Marshall pleaded guilty to failing to supply a . specimen of breath on September 30. Chairman of the bench, Geoff West, . said: 'We can understand how it must have annoyed you that evening. Like . your lawyer said, it was your only mistake (to not give a sample). 'Nevertheless you have learned a valuable lesson. 'You have got more than 12 points . which means an automatic six month disqualification. This means you . cannot drive a motor vehicle in any road or public place at all until . the period ends. 'If you do drive then you have committed a serious offence and could be sent to prison or disqualified again.' Marshall was banned for six months . after the court heard he had also been caught on a mobile at the wheel . and already had three points on his licence for speeding. Alter ego: Marshall is well known for his lead role in a long-running series of adverts for BT . The court heard that Marshall, who . lives in Long Barton near Wells, Somerset, with his self-employed . plumber girlfriend, had been in London doing voiceover work on September . 30 this year. He had returned on the train to . Castle Cary station - after consuming a gin and tonic on the journey . back - before picking up his green Jaguar and driving to Wells. The actor then left his car in the car park and went to a bar for more drinks. He returned before midnight but decided not to drive the short distance back to his village. Tim Rutherford, prosecuting, said: 'Police were called to Tesco in Wells following reports of a possible drunk driver. 'At 12.04am PC Reynolds attended the . scene and saw a green Jaguar. He approached the vehicle and saw a male . by the name of Kris Marshall sat in the drivers seat. 'The seat was reclined he and appeared to be asleep at that point. 'The officer noticed the keys still . in the ignition, noticed a smell of alcohol. He woke him and said have . you been drinking - he said ""Yes I have"". 'His eyes were glazed.' Comic talent: Marshall (centre) as Nick in the BBC comedy series My Family with Zoe Wanamaker (left) and Daniela Denby (right) Big screen: Marshall also appeared in the hit film Love Actually. He is pictured here with actress Michelle Williams . Police carried out a positive breath . test on a co-operative Marshall before arresting him and taking him to . Yeovil Police Station an hour's drive away. The court heard that when he arrived at the station he decided to 'effectively avoid giving a specimen'. Mr Rutherford said: 'It appears Mr Marshall failed to seal his lips around the tube.' Marshall told officers he did not have any medical reason not to take the test - apart from mild asthma. Richard Hallam, defending Marshall, . stressed that his client had made the sensible decision not to drive . back home as he was over the limit. He told the court that Marshall did . not want to leave his car to get a taxi or walk home - because it would . mean going through a large unlit wood. Mr Hallam said his client had been co-operating with the police right up until they arrested him. He said: 'The truth of the matter is that he felt a little aggrieved at being arrested. Role: Marshall with co-star Esther Hall in a BT broadband internet advert . 'He felt he had made a responsible decision in not driving while over the limit. He made a decision to sleep in the vehicle. 'Many members of the public do not understand the charge of being drunk in charge of a vehicle. 'He was a little fed up. He accepts that it was in his mind to affectively avoid giving a specimen. 'I have told him that was a mistake.' The court heard that Marshall, who . already had three points on his license for a speeding offence, had . recently been spotted on the phone while at the wheel. His lawyer told the court that he had surrendered his license to the police and was awaiting another three points.

"Failure: The unmanned mission went awry when the engine on the third stage of the Proton-M booster rocket failed 100 miles up . A Russian rocket ferrying one of Europe's most powerful satellites into space has exploded in the earth's atmosphere, setting the former Soviet state's commercial space program back 'three to four years'. Russia's workhorse Proton-M was carrying the $275-million Express AM4R satellite when it failed and burned up this morning, destroying the telecommunications module intended to bring high-speed internet to remote parts of the country. It was the second failure for the Proton-M in less than a year, and the second time that it had failed to deliver such a European satellite, after the last one crashed shortly after launch in 2011. Friday's unmanned mission went awry when the engine on the third stage of the Proton-M booster rocket failed, Oleg Ostapenko, head of the Russian space agency Roskosmos, told Russian news agencies. He said the precise cause was unknown. The failure occurred at an altitude of 160 km (100 miles), about nine minutes after the early-morning lift-off from the Russian-leased Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan. The state-run RIA quoted Ostapenko as saying that the rocket and all debris had burned up in the atmosphere: 'We can say with certainty that nothing reached Earth.' However, Russian media said some debris may have fallen into the Pacific or been scattered over Siberia and Russia's Far East. No casualties or damage were reported on the ground. The lost Express AM4R satellite, worth more than 200 million euros ($275 million), was described by its maker Astrium, a unit of the European aerospace group Airbus, as one of the most powerful satellites built in Europe. Its loss delays a number of commercial projects by three to four years. 'It's a heavy blow, of course. And the thing is that our workhorse rocket - our most powerful and the most-used rocket - has such a bad record,' Ivan Moiseyev, head of the Russian-based Institute of Space Policy think tank, told Kommersant-FM radio. Trouble in the sky: A Proton M rocket carrying the Canadian Anik F3 telecommunication satellite blasts off at Baikonur Cosmodromein 2007. But it has suffered a series of mishaps since . Embarrassing: In September 2007, the Proton-M's booster rocket crashed destroying the Japanese JCSAT-11 communications satellite on board. Pictured is the crash site near Zhezkazgan, in Kazakhstan . He said the rocket had a 7 percent failure rate, and its unreliability was making it harder for Russia to compete in the multibillion-dollar global satellite launch industry, giving a boost to its European rival Arianespace and the American newcomer SpaceX. 'It's a very unsuccessful picture on the whole and, if you compare it with our main competitors, with Europe, their last accident was 12 years ago,' Moiseyev said. Last July, three navigation satellites worth about $200 million were lost when the Proton-M rocket crashed near the launch pad shortly after take-off. That accident strained relations between Kazakhstan and Russia and led Kazakhstan to temporarily ban Proton launches from Baikonur. State-run Rossiya-24 television said all launches had been suspended from Kazakhstan after Friday's failure.","It's 2nd failure for Russia's workhorse Proton-M rocket in less than a year .

"Tourists visiting Spain and Italy could be at risk of contracting dengue fever in the future. European holiday destinations could become hotspots for the nasty viral illness thanks to climate change, experts have warned. If global warming continues on its current trajectory, the risk of dengue fever in Europe is likely to increase, they say. Tourists visiting areas of southern Spain such as Torremolinos (pictured) could be at risk of dengue fever in the future, due to climate change . The Po Valley in Italy, the Spanish Mediterranean and southern Spain are the areas at most risk, according to research by the University of East Anglia (UEA). Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. Symptoms include a severe flu-like illness, fever, headache, muscle ache, rash, nausea and vomiting. It is often referred to as 'breakbone' fever due to the excruciating pain it causes. Mosquitoes that carry and transmit the virus thrive in warm and humid conditions – which could one day include large areas in southern Europe. The new study was based on data collected in Mexico, where dengue is a common problem. Researchers looked at the occurrence of the viral illness and climate variables such as temperature, humidity and rainfall, along with other factors. They then combined their findings with information about EU countries, to model which areas are most likely to be at risk, according to the study, published in the journal BMC Public Health. Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. It thrives in warm and humid conditions - which could one day include include large areas in southern Europe . ‘Our study has shown that the risk of . dengue fever is likely to increase in Europe under climate change, but . that almost all of the excess risk will fall on the coastal areas of the . Mediterranean and Adriatic seas and the North Eastern part of Italy, . particularly the Po Valley,’ said lead researcher Professor Paul Hunter. ‘The exact incidence of dengue fever is dependent on several other factors, some of which we were unable to model at this stage. ‘Nevertheless, public health agencies in high risk areas need to plan, implement and evaluate active reporting of mosquito populations and clinical surveillance by local doctors. ‘Work should be carried out to improve awareness of the increased risk amongst health practitioners and the general public.’ Dengue (pictured) is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. Symptoms include a severe flu-like illness, fever, headache, muscle ache, rash, nausea and vomiting . The scientists said that while Mexico has less variation in weather during the different seasons than Europe, more work could take this into account. In July, health officials said that the number of travellers returning to England with dengue fever is rising. Between 2012 and 2013, officials noted a 58 per cent increase in the number of cases of dengue fever reported among holidaymakers. Public Health England (PHE) said that in 2013, a total of 541 people returned to Britain with the infection from dengue-affected countries, compared to 343 people in 2012. Most cases were reported in travellers to India and Thailand, but PHE also noted an increase in cases associated with travel to Barbados during 2013.","Risk of dengue fever in Europe is likely to increase, researchers claim .

"Semesa Rokoduguni is out of England's international against South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday, with Marland Yarde replacing the Bath wing in the squad, head coach Stuart Lancaster announced on Tuesday. Rokoduguni, who made his debut in last week's 24-21 defeat by New Zealand, injured his thigh and Lancaster believes there is not enough time for him to recover to face the Springboks. That is the only change to the 23 players selected to face the All Blacks, although James Haskell is added to the squad as cover for Tom Wood, who was unable to take a full part in Tuesday's training. Marland Yard will step in for England for the Twickenham showdown against South Africa . Semesa Rokoduguni runs with the ball in training on Tuesday, but has been ruled out of Saturday's clash . 'Tom is still sore from the weekend and sat out training so we are including five back rows to give us options before we announce the side on Thursday morning,' Lancaster said. 'The players have responded well and we've had a good few days' training,' he added. 'Roko did some limited training this morning but is unlikely to fully recover from his thigh injury in time for the game, so Marland is in the group.' Forwards: Dave Attwood, Kieran Brookes, Dylan Hartley, James Haskell, George Kruis, Courtney Lawes, Joe Marler, Matt Mullan, David Wilson, Ben Morgan, Chris Robshaw, Billy Vunipola, Rob Webber, Tom Wood.

"Arsenal are prepared to spend another £20million in the January transfer market. The areas they are particularly scouting for are centre half, defensive midfield and left back. They will weigh up marquee players, budget ones and those with potential. Here Sportsmail highlights just how much bang for his buck Arsene Wenger may be able to find. VIDEO Arsene Wenger acting coy when discussing Khedira last transfer window . Arsene Wenger knows his defence needs reinforcements but he is working on a tight budget in January . WINSTON REID (West Ham) Cost £8m . West Ham do not want to sell Reid in January and disrupt their promising season. He is out of contract in the summer but the £8m price tag will reflect their desire to keep him. Not a typical Arsenal player but has Premier League experience, wants to defend and is a threat at set-pieces, which the Gunners have been lacking. Winston Reid would not be a cheap solution, but he has the benefit of Premier League experience . Reid has been excellent for West Ham over the past few seasons, and his power in the air would be vital . SAMI KHEDIRA (Real Madrid) £6m . Khedira is a player that could change Arsenal’s future and is vastly experienced despite still only being 27. Madrid will consider selling in January if he continually stalls on a new contract and have already targeted his compatriot Christoph Kramer, 23, of Bayer Leverkusen. All the big clubs are interested and big wages are an issue - but they should be worth paying. Adding World Cup-winning midfielder Sami Khedira would be a massive boost for Arsenal in January . The Real star would be available for the cut price of £6million, but his wages might be a sticking point . MARCELO BROZOVIC (Dinamo Zagreb) Cost £6.5m . Talks have been opened with the midfielder’s agents and they are hopeful of agreeing a deal with Arsenal but decisions don’t come quickly at the Emirates. Brozovic has played as a playmaker and attacking midfielder but the Gunners believe he can play a more defensive role. Room for improvement at 21 and cheaper than William Carvalho at Sporting. Marcelo Brozovic is already in talks with the Gunners, but it remains to be seen if the deal gets done in January . MATIJA NASTASIC (Manchester City) Cost £12million . Arsenal have made enquiries for Nastasic and City will sell at the right price as they are actively looking for another centre back themselves in anticipation the Serbia defender will leave. There is interest from Italy also with Inter Milan and Juventus among his admirers. Would fit into Arsenal’s style. Matija Nastasic (left) would fit into Arsenal's style, but at £12million his injury problems could be a concern . RON VLAAR (Aston Villa) Cost £12m . Vlaar may be out of contract next summer but the price again reflects Villa’s dire need to keep him. Arsenal will also face competition from Southampton, Manchester United and Tottenham, who are weighing up defensive changes. Vlaar has the ability and physical presence to fit in comfortably at the Emirates. Ron Vlaar (right) would bring more solidity to the Arsenal defence, but there are several interested teams . CHRIS SMALLING (Man Utd) Cost £16m . Manchester United refused to sell Smalling to Arsenal in the summer and will not let the England centre half go at this stage either with a lack of defensive cover. It is fair to say that Louis van Gaal is continually taking stock of his defenders and Smalling’s injury record continues to hinder his development. Chris Smalling was sent off in last month's Manchester derby, but is still not central to Louis van Gaal's plans . Arsenal have enquired about Smalling before but with United lacking cover, he won't be allowed to leave . VIRGIL VAN DIJK (Celtic) Cost £8m . Has impressed in Scotland and during Celtic’s European campaigns but there are doubts whether he is at the level to seriously improve upon Arsenal’s deficiencies. He is good on the ball and scores goals but may lack the extra quality to make a difference to their current squad. Celtic's Virgil van Dijk has an eye for goal and has impressed in domestic and European football . There remain questions over whether Van Dijk would dramatically improve Arsenal's options . TYRONE MINGS (Ipswich Town) Cost £7m . Tall, powerful looking left back who has caught the eye of a number of Premier League scouts and was the subject of a bid from Crystal Palace in August. He continues to impress at Ipswich and has good character and potential to switch to centre back. Very good potential but not quite ready. Tyrone Mings has impressed during his time at Ipswich, but is still a prospect rather than a ready-made star . GIANNELLI IMBULA (Marseille) £20m . Arsenal have been joined at the hip by Chelsea scouts at most of Imbula’s games since he made his breakthrough at Guingamp. Powerful presence who can dominate midfield but Marseille’s prised possession won’t come cheap. Wenger also looked at 19-year-old clubmate Stephane Sparagna who is out of contract soon but injuries have dogged him. Arsenal have been watching Imbula closely, but could face competition from the likes of Chelsea . Imbula is a powerful midfielder, but is likely to cost Arsenal all of their £20million budget in January . ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE (Lyon) £15m . Arsenal don’t need a striker but that hasn’t stopped them looking at Lyon’s Lacazette who is the top scorer in France with 11 goals. A target for Newcastle and Liverpool, he has also been watched by Tottenham in recent weeks. Ready-made for Arsenal but only really required should they sell. Alexandre Lacazatte has been superb so far this season in France, but do Arsenal need another forward? ONE TO PONDER... AYMERIC LAPORTE (Athletic Bilbao) Cost £34m (buy-out clause) Stylish centre back with plenty of admirers. French-born but has been in Bilbao’s youth system since the age of 16. Still raw but plenty of potential. Manchester United and Barcelona are contemplating bids but Bilbao will not negotiate - it’s buy-out clause only and that will keep Arsenal at bay for now. Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte (right) would cost a massive £34m, but Arsenal are interested .","Arsenal want to buy a centre back, left back and defensive midfielder .

"Researchers have found that the SARS outbreak, which killed 774 people, had its origin in Chinese Horseshoe bats. Scientists discovered two SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in the bats which they claim are very similar to the virus that infected humans. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic killed around 10 per cent of the 8094 people infected in 2002 and 2003. Researchers have found that the SARS outbreak, which killed 774 people, had its origin in Chinese Horseshoe bats. This image is of a Horseshoe Bat found in Borneo . Diarrhoea was commonly reported among the patients and severe complications included kidney failure and acute breathing difficulties. Scientists now claim the outbreak could have originated from wildlife markets were the bats were kept, or from someone living close to a bat cave. Chinese Rufous Horseshoe bats, so-called because of the horshoe-shaped bulge on their nose, are found in China, India, Nepal, and Vietnam. Scientists discovered two SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in the bats which they claim are very similar to the virus that infected humans . The above image, supplied by the IUCN Red List, shows the Chinese Rufous Horseshoe bat's range, predominately in China, some parts of India and Nepal. They have leaf-like, horseshoe-shaped bulges on their noses. The species send location calls through these structures, which scientists believe may serve to focus the sound. Their hind limbs are not well developed, so they cannot walk on all fours. However, their wings are broad, making their flight particularly agile. They are mostly dull brown or reddish-brown in colour and vary in size from 2.5 cm to 14 cm in length. The research team, led by Professor Shi Zhengli from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing found that the viruses in these bats infect human cells in the same way. This means that the coronaviruses could in fact move directly from bats to humans. The team added that the Sars-like coronavirus is around 95 per cent genetically similar to the Sars virus in humans. Previous studies had shown that the SARS virus bats carried was close to the one that infected humans. The major difference, however was a spike protein which infected human cells was coded in a way so that it disabled the infection. Scientists theorised that the virus transferred to civets in Chinese markets, where it underwent the genetic changes to infect humans. The finding, which were reported in the journal Nature, ‘definitively confirms’ bats as the origin of the virus. Scientists hope their finding will help governments design better prevention strategies for SARS and similar epidemics. According to the researchers, the finding highlights the importance of protecting the bat’s natural environment so they are not forced into highly populated urban areas in search of food. The research team, led by Professor Shi Zhengli from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing found that the viruses in these bats infect human cells in the same way .","Researchers in Beijing uncovered two SARS coronaviruses in the bats .

"Set against a stunning autumnal backdrop hundreds of foxhunters have taken to the saddle to ride out to the blaring sound of the horns, signalling the start of the hunting season. Mounted high on their horses, foxhunters of all ages and dressed in smart hunting jackets, gathered as scores of British hunts gathered today. Cutting a majestic sight through the countryside surrounding Headlam village in County Durham, the Zetland Hunt paraded through the rural lanes, drawing crowds to watch the spectacle. Tally ho: Hundreds of foxhunters rode out for the start of the hunting season today. Hounds from the Zetland Hunt in North Yorkshire set off at dawn with huntsman David Jukes at the healm . Blessed: The Reverend Pell blessed the hounds  of the Zetland Hunt and riders warmed themselves with glasses of port before they set off . Huntsman David Jukes, left, sounds the horn signalling the start of the first day of the hunting calendar . Hounds from the Zetland Hunt led the way as the first drag hunting event of the season took place . The hunt gathered at Headlam village in County Durham at dawn . Following tradition, Reverend Andy Pell blessed the hounds and the riders warmed themselves with glasses of port before setting off. Moments later huntsman David Jukes sounded a horn to signal the start of the hunting season. Meanwhile in Appleton Roebuck, North Yorkshire, the York and Ainsty South Hunt . filled the roads around the village, with hoards . of riders following the leaders clad in bright red jackets. Despite the overcast weather the huntsmen and women of all ages relished the start of the new season. Traditionally the hunting season starts at the beginning of November. Many . supporters of fox hunting are continuing to press for a repeal of the . ban on hunting with dogs, in force since February 2005. They say the current law is hard to interpret and enforce. Tim Bonner, director of campaigns at the . Countryside Alliance, told The Guardian: 'We are now going into the ninth hunting . season under the Hunting Act – an act that is not working for hunts, . antis, the courts or the wildlife it claims to safeguard.' But anti-hunting campaigners warned their team of investigators will be out in a bid to catch those flouting the law. Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, told the paper: 'Hunters found to be flouting the law need to watch out. Our team of . investigators and the Hunting Act are here to stay.' In Appleton Roebuck, North Yorkshire, the York and Ainsty South Hunt set off . The riders dressed in smart attire followed the hunt leaders clad in their red blazers . Members of the public came out to watch the spectacle as members of the York and Ainsty South Hunt paraded through the rural lanes . Between 2005 and 2011, a total of 332 individuals were prosecuted under the Hunting Act. Of these, 239 were found guilty. Earlier this month Prime Minister David Cameron was reportedly said to be keen on relaxing hunting laws, showing sympathy to land owners who are losing stock to foxes. A cross-party alliance of MPs suggested that the law banning farmers from using more than two dogs to flush out foxes and shoot them should be scrapped. The Prime Minister said the House of Commons 'may wish to consider' a vote on the issue to make hunting with a full pack of dogs legal. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'There is a very specific issue here around pest control and the impact it has on hill farmers. 'The Prime Minister has some sympathy with these concerns. Given the cross-party nature of concerns this is something which the house may wish to consider.' However, Number 10 would not guarantee a free vote on repealing the ban during this Parliament.

"Host commentator . Stuart Fraser: Job done, Andy Murray. He came out here knowing he had to win and he delivered. Getting it done in straight sets will also help too. All to play for in Group B on Thursday as Murray plays Federer and Raonic takes on Nishikori. Lot of qualification scenarios involved and I'm afraid it's a bit of a mathematical maze... Murray tells Sky Sports: 'It's nice. Last year was tough but I'm very happy to be back. The court atmosphere has been unbelievable. Nice match to look forward to against Roger now. Murray started the game off by answering a net call with one of his own and it proved too good for Raonic. More unforced errors from the Canadian made Murray's life easier before going to deuce. Raonic pulled back two match points before Murray finally put him to the sword with another strong serve which Raonic can only hit long. That's more like it from Murray! The Scot played the return of the match, sprinting across the baseline before whipping the ball across Raonic and it seemed to rattle the Canadian as the crowd sensed weakness. He will serve for the match! Murray serves out well. It's been a long time coming, but it looks like we've got a game on here. Raonic wins the following game with a fine serve out of Murray's reach as he continues to send Murray around the court and back again. Murray serves to stay in the second set... Murray gets away with a soft serve as Raonic hits the net with his forehand. The Canadian has the upper-hand in the set. Mike Dickson: You can see how the confidence permeated back into Raonic after he broke back and I’d say Murray’s best hope here is to cling on for a tiebreak. Raonic smashes his way through another service game without losing a point. The 23-year-old looks to finally be gaining some confidence. Murray holds it together to bring the score level once again thanks to another unforced error from his opponent. Raonic battles through another games and survives a couple of deuces. The Canadian is starting to turn the screw here.  Raonic wins the games with a lovely backhand volley. Stuart Fraser: Tremendous moment during last changeover as DJ plays Fatboy Slim - Rockafeller Skank and the big screen cuts to an elderly gentleman in the crowd with his fingers in his ears. I'm sure he would also not approve of the way both players dropped serve in consecutive games there... Murray is absolutely furious with himself as he allows Raonic back into this set. The Scot sent a backhand wide after brilliant work from Raonic at the net. The Sky Sports presenters are forced to apologise as the microphones pick up Murray shouting, 'every f****** time' as the Scot miss-hits a return and is punished. Raonic was 40-0 up but Murray battled back before the Canadian looked to have hit a woman with his serve while at Deuce. Raonic hit the following serve well wide and couldn't regain his composure as yet another unforced error gives Murray the game. Murray continues to hold without any real threat to his serve. Stuart Fraser: Roger Federer will no doubt be following this one with interest. Anything other than a Murray straight sets victory and the Swiss qualifies for the semis tonight. If Murray does go on to win this in straights, then it's all still to play for in Group B on Thursday. Mike Dickson: The usual smattering of footballers not present this evening but 17,500 crowd getting right behind Murray. A solid performance from him in the first set and he’s profited from the wayward forehand of Raonic, whose first serve has missed too often to cause what would only be a mini upset. As against Federer, you’d expect Raonic to improve in this set. Raonic holds his serve well to take the first game of the second set. He didn't start the game well but ended with a nice volley and a serve that proved too hot to handle for Murray. Raonic made the final game of the set a difficult one, but Murray got the points on the board early enough to see it out. The Scot looks a different player from the one that lost to Nishikori on Sunday. Raonic won't go down in a fight, particularly when he's got that huge serve. The Canadian hits some big serves and actually started to make Murray run around a little bit. Murray hits a return long to have Raonic the game. Muzza will serve for the set. Stuart Fraser: 'Just a sick slice,' says the Canadian behind me as Murray plays one of his trademark shots with plenty of spin down the line. I wholeheartedly agree. Moments later, Murray has the first break of the match. Raonic looking cagey on his forehand side. That will go down as Murray's easiest game of the night so far. The Scot seems to have got a real adrenalin rush from his previous break and Raonic much now serve to stay in the set. Murray earns himself the break and pumps his fist towards the crowd. Raonic has played several wide shots tonight. His latest coming in the sixth game from what should have been an easy smash. He's also only getting 33 per cent of his first serves in. Murray on the other hand is looking more and more up for it. 'Come on, fire up' he shouts. Mike Dickson: Murray couldn't have asked for more than two second serves on those break points, you don't get many opportunities against the giant Canuck. Crowd noticeably more partisan tonight. Murray continues to hold his serve and looks to be getting in the groove now. The Scot player an excellent forehand to beat Raonic before a delightful backhand slice saw the Canadian scrambling for the ball. Raonic does well to keep his cool and win four points in a row to stop Murray from an early break in the first. The big Canadian made two unforced errors before battling back and using that big serve to his advantage. Murray makes hard work of the third set but the British No 1 wins it quite brilliantly with a drop shot which Raonic can only hit out of the court. Both players are taking a while to get going, particularly Raonic, who seems a tad nervous. Raonic answer with his own hold and hit couple of pretty un-returnable serves as you'd expect from the big-hitter. Murray looked a little sluggish during that one. 1-1! Murray wins the first game with relative ease. The Scot showed some brilliant handling and kept Raonic on the move which will be crucial this evening. He finished the game off with an ace. Judy Murray is in the audience with Strictly Come Dancing partner Anton du Beke. Let's hope Murray's performance isn't as stiff as his mother's... Stuart Fraser: The pre-show in the arena is always impressive. A stirring video message from John McEnroe, a dazzling lights show and then the players walk out onto court in a boxing-style entrance. In fact, even the umpire has his moment as he is introduced to the crowd as he walks out! Murray wins the coin toss and elects to serves first. It's a positive step as he looks to get in the lead early on. The pair are currently going through the rally warm-ups. Murray tells Sky Sports: 'Hopefully I'll hit the ball better than I did the other day. I'll need to play, hopefully get a lot of returns back. If I can make it tough for Raonic on his service games, that's half the battle.' Mike Dickson: After his dreadful performance on Sunday against Kei Nishikori I see two reasons for optimism around Murray tonight: Firstly he tends to play better when his back is against the wall and he wants to prove people wrong, which is the case tonight. Also, Roger Federer said after his match that he thinks this court is difficult to blast your way out of trouble on with the serve, due to its sluggish speed, so perhaps that main weapon for Raonic might not be as potent as usual. Another full house for the evening so there ought to be no lack of atmosphere as Murray tries to survive. Stuart Fraser: Not the best quality doubles match but entertaining nonetheless as Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo beat Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez in two tiebreaks. Audible gasps in the press centre at some of those missed volleys... We now await the arrival of Andy Murray and Milos Raonic. The O2 Arena crowd are being made to wait for the start of Murray's match, but they don't mind be the sounds of it as the Dodig/Melo vs Granollers/Lopez doubles match is currently throwing up a fantastic tie-break decider. Stuart Fraser: After a hectic run of 23 matches in 37 days to qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals, Andy Murray faces the possibility that this tournament may effectively be over for him on day three. After Roger Federer's victory over Kei Nishikori this afternoon, Murray has to beat Milos Raonic tonight if he is to go into Thursday's match against Federer still with a chance to go through to the semi-finals. It's squeaky bum time, as one of Murray's fellow Scots once famously said... Federer picked up his second win of the week earlier this morning with a straight sets victory against Murray's conqueror Nishikori. Federer made the most of Nishikori's erratic play to secure a 6-3, 6-2 victory and move closer to a semi-final spot while increasing the pressure on Murray.

"The new Scotland opened this Test match in lively fashion but the old, frail Scotland returned to shoot themselves in the foot and fall victim to a late Italian resurgence in a third straight RBS Six Nations defeat. Having come into the match with two promising performances, the Scots were looking for a big performance and a comprehensive win against an Italian team that had been competitive but well beaten in the final quarter of both of their games against Ireland and England. This was where the picture for both teams turned. Scotland started brightly with a penalty from Greig Laidlaw and interception try by Mark Bennett inside the first seven minutes, Laidlaw’s conversion handing the hosts into a 10-0 lead. A last-minute penalty try gave Italy the victory against Scotland in the Six Nations . Italy scrum half Edoardo Gori celebrates with the visiting fans at full time at Hampden Park . Scotland players look dejected at the final whistle after the 22-19 defeat to Italy on Saturday . The Italian team were in jubilant spirits at the final whistle and went to celebrate with the supporters . However, Italy responded within minutes, revealing the potency of a well-crafted lineout drive which finished with most of the Italian team driving lock Josh Furno over the Scottish line. Laidlaw came back with a penalty but then Italy did the same from the restart to keep Italy hanging on at 13-8 down after the first quarter. The scrums were a major blight on this match and Irish referee George Clancy never got to grips with them, one factor in styming Scotland’s attack. He scolded both front rows at one stage for a “terrible attitude” as successive scrums ended in penalties, twice against Scotland for ‘early engage’, and seemed to give up in the second half. The lineouts were not much better, and ultimately the Italians used two – one at the end of each half – to turn one area of dominance into the match-winning points. If Bennett’s try had some luck, the Italians’ was bizarrely fortunate, Haimona’s penalty coming back off a post and bouncing above Stuart Hogg for 6ft 2in winger Giovanbattista Venditti to grasp and crash down by the post under a welter of tackles. The ball was lost from sight and Clancy asked for the TMO to investigate whether a try had been scored. English TMO Graham Hughes deemed the ball had indeed been touched down by Venditti, in one movement, and while controversial – and provoking fury from Scottish players and support – further replays showed that the winger had shown great skill in rolling the ball from behind his back to the ground with the help of the post protector before Tim Swinson got his hand under it. Haimona converted the try and again Scotland were reined back in, leaving the score 16-15 to the hosts at half-time. Italy captain Sergio Parisse celebrates with his team-mates after a fine victory .

Bennett celebrates with Stuart Hogg after scoring a try against Italy . Scotland captain Greg Laidlaw kicks a penalty for the hosts but the game ended in defeat . The second half opened with more scrappy fare and Haimona was replaced by the former Scotland under-20 cap Tommy Allan, having failed to shake off a leg injury, but Allan missed a chance to put the Italians ahead, striking a 35-metre kick from in front of the posts just wide of the right upright. The Scots gradually began to rebuild the momentum generated on the first half and Hogg was almost sprung, but he was in front of Sean Lamont when receiving the final pass 20 metres out. Laidlaw rewarded a good period of Scottish attack in the visitors’ 22, with a penalty, stretching the lead to four points, with 15 minutes remaining, but the continuing lineout and scrum nightmare took the Italians into the last ten minutes firmly pressing the home 22 and with chants of ‘Italia, Italia’ ringing out. The Scottish pack stood firm and almighty roar greeted Clancy’s whistle and decision of a collapsed scrum by Italy, but Horne, hobbling with an injury, critically missed touch with the penalty, and Italy seized their chance. A lineout was brought down and lock Ben Toolis yellow carded and when the pack drove to the Scots line and went down, Clancy deemed Scotland at fault, awarding a penalty try, and showed Hamish Watson a yellow card - a rare ignominy for two debutants - as Allan converted to put the seal on a dramatic 22-19 win and revenge for Scotland’s smash-and-grab in Rome last year.

"Roger Federer moved a step closer to a place in the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals with a straight-sets win against Kei Nishikori. In yet another one-sided singles match at London's O2 Arena, world No 2 Federer took just 69 minutes to beat US Open runner-up Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-2 in Group B.

Federer's win also means that British No 1 Murray will take to the court later knowing that he has to beat Raonic to still have a chance of making the semi-finals. Despite some early pressure from Nishikori, it was Federer who got the first break as he stepped up and hit an inside-out forehand for 3-1. That break proved enough for Federer in the first set as the 17-time Grand Slam champion went on to close it out in 35 minutes.

A double fault from Nishikori handed Federer a double break for 5-2 and the Swiss served out the match with a big serve down the middle which Nishikori could not return.

"Just a week after posting terrifying photographs of himself in the hospital after his liver and kidney started to fail due to years of 'hard boozing,' Deryck Whibley has shared another, happier shot.

"Facebook stalking: Keeping an eye on the ex can stop you healing, a new study suggests . Before the internet made everyone just a click of the mouse away, the end of a relationship would often lead to a cutting of ties as both partners moved on with their lives. But Facebook has disrupted the process, a new study claims, with newly-singles who stay friends with their exes on the social networking site struggling to recover emotionally . when a relationship ends. Researcher Tara Marshall, from Brunel University in London, suggests there is a lot of additional heartbreak in store for the third of us who keep an eye on the ex - or 'Facebook-stalking', as some may call it. With 900 million Facebook users in the world, it suggests a lot of broken hearts will take a time to mend. Marshall asked 464 . participants to evaluate their Facebook usage, and estimated up to a third use Facebook to check on the activities of former romantic partners. The study collected asked about each user's emotional recovery and personal adjustment . following the breakup of a romantic relationship. It evaluated . parameters such as negative feelings, sexual desire and emotional . longing for the ex-partner, and feelings of reduced personal growth as . measures of distress and the ability to move forward with their lives. The study, entitled 'Facebook Surveillance of Former Romantic Partners: . Associations with PostBreakup Recovery and Personal Growth', assessed the . effects of continued Facebook contact with an ex-partner and of . Facebook surveillance, in which there is no actual online contact, but . one individual monitors the Facebook page and postings of another. Brenda Wiederhold, editor-in-chief of Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social . Networking at the Interactive Media Institute in San Diego, said: 'This study sees again virtual life mirroring real life. Just as real . life contact with ex-partners may inhibit growth, healing, and . well-being, so may virtual contact.' While Marshall's study suggests a third of people 'stalk' their exes, a study earlier this year by Veronika Lukacs at the University of Western Ontorio suggested up to 90 per cent of new singles would follow their ex on Facebook. Comments left under your profile picture on Facebook are one of the biggest indicators of your social status, according to a new study. Researchers at the University of Missouri say that the image we choose for our public persona, and what other people have to say about it underneath, strongly affects the level of the profile owner's perceived attractiveness - physically, socially, and professionally. Doctoral student Seoyeon Hong said that browsers, such as potential partners or employers, hold more weight by the comments left on your profile picture than any other part of your page - so your reputation is in the hands of those who leave a message. For anyone unfamiliar with the social network, Facebook profile photos are the first photos visible on a user's profile. Other Facebook users are able to post comments about each profile photo, which are visible to anyone who views the photo.","With 900 million Facebook users in the world, a lot of broken hearts may take longer to heal ."

"He might be less than impressed by the Chinese record on human rights but that wasn't enough to stop Prince Charles from visiting London's Chinatown to help usher in the Year of the Sheep. The Prince of Wales was on cheerful form and joked with performers dressed as dragons as he took in the colourful scene. With him was the Duchess of Cornwall, who cut an elegant figure in a pretty cream cashmere skirt and jacket by Anna Valentine and a delicate printed silk scarf. Scroll down for video . Nice to meet you: Charles sidles up to a man celebrating Chinese New Year while dressed as a dragon . What did he say? Charles bursts into laughter after sharing a joke with the performer . As well as taking in the sights, the royal couple were in Chinatown to open the China Exchange, a purpose-built exhibition space destined to become a hub for theatrical and arts performances. During the visit, Prince and Duchess were introduced to a number of Chinese traditions, including calligraphy and dumpling making - both of which Camilla pulled off with aplomb. Charles grinned as his wife attempted to make dim sum in the shape of fold and silver ingots, which are believed to bring you luck and prosperity, before watching a chop stick demonstration. Camilla was a little more reluctant to try the trickier art of Chinese calligraphy but was praised for her 'impressive' first try at the character representing 'sky. While Prince Charles chose not to show off his cooking skills, he did make a speech in which he revealed he and Camilla were 'thrilled' to be there and made an attempt at wishing revellers a Happy New Year in Cantonese. Don't eat me! Charles steps hastily away from the 'dragon' after cracking his joke . What's in there? The Duchess of Cornwall peers into the performer's mask as they enjoy a chat . Looking good: Charles was accompanied by his wife, who looked lovely in a cream cashmere suit . Colourful: The royal couple were met by a group of dancers and performers dressed as dragons . 'Xin Nian Hao [Happy New Year]!' Charles told the crowds, adding: 'I rather hope the [Chinese] Ambassador [Liu Xiaoming] will give me a tutorial after.' He also cracked a joke about finding it difficult to tell the difference between the Cantonese for sheep and goat, both of which are called 'yáng', in a reference to the new Year of the Sheep. The eighth sign in the 12-year Chinese cycle, sheep are considered to be lucky in China and thus, sheep years are usually thought to be auspicious, particularly for finances. In Chinese astrology, people born in sheep years are said to be peace-loving, kind and popular but also clingy and resistant to change. Born in 1948, Prince Charles entered the world in the Year of the Rat, which, apparently, makes him charming but aggressive, talkative and sometimes stubborn. Charles, who did plenty of chatting during the visit, was also in Chinatown to highlight the work of the Prince's Charities Foundation China, which was established by the Prince in 2008. Celebration: London's Chinatown was awash with colour as the Year of the Sheep began . Hello in there: The Duchess bent down to get a better look at the performer's face inside his dragon costume . That's an unusual entourage: The dragons accompanied the couple as they toured Chinatown . Enjoying himself: Charles was on cheerful form as he watched the dragons in action . Culinary whizz: The Duchess of Cornwall showed off her cooking skills and helped to make dim sum . Clever: The dumplings were shaped to resemble ingots of gold and silver and are thought to bring fortune . Based in Hong Kong, it aims to 'promote mutual understanding' between people from the UK and China. Another of his charities, the Foundation for Building Community, also played a role in supporting and developing the concept for the China Exchange. In his address, which was made to members of the community and benefactors of the centre, he  hoped the building 'will be a platform for the exchange of ideas between the East and the West'. Finishing with a flourish, he ended the speech by revealing that he and Camilla were 'delighted to join you in celebrating the Chinese New Year'. Speaking after the visit, Geoffrey Leong, owner of Dumplings' Legend which was visited by the royal couple, said: . 'The first day of the New Year is the best day to take part in Chinese traditions, it means it will certainly be a lucky and happy year for [Charles and Camilla].' He added: 'We spoke about all the different animals and I told Prince Charles that I believed he was the year of the rat and Camilla was the year of the pig - I wasn't sure if he already knew that. 'Everyone in Chinatown is delighted that they have come here to celebrate with us. We are a big part of the London community so it's great to see them taking pleasure in these traditions.' Nearly done: The Duchess furrowed her brow in concentration as she neatly filled her dim sum . Difficult: The Duchess was a little reluctant to try calligraphy but eventually managed to complete a word . Nicely done: The Duchess' calligraphy was made up of two characters that spelled the word 'sky' Ta da: Her efforts were met with a round of applause, with her tutors calling the work 'impressive' Well-earned: Both Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall enjoyed a cup of tea at The China Exchange .","Charles and Camilla were in Chinatown to celebrate Chinese New Year .

"Former Sunderland chief executive Roberto De Fanti has hit back at claims made by Paolo Di Canio about his part, or lack of, in the club's recruitment last summer. Di Canio, who was sacked at the beginning of last season, says he didn't choose any of the 14 players the Black Cats signed before his departure. But De Fanti has slammed the Italian boss, insisting he 'blames everybody but himself' and that he had his say on every new arrival. Paolo Di Canio, who was sacked as Sunderland boss last year, claims he didn't pick players to sign in 2013/14 . Emanuele Giaccherini (left) and Jozy Altidore (right) were two of 14 brought in last summer . But former chief executive Roberto De Fanti says Di Canio 'blames everybody but himself' De Fanti told BBC Sport: 'Paolo had the final decision on every player.' He added: 'He always blames everybody else but himself.' The comments contradict those of Di Canio, who was speaking earlier on Goals on Sunday. and said: 'Not one of those was brought by me.' 'De Fanti and Valentino Angeloni were the two responsible for that technical error, with the maximum support from the chairman, which is Ellis Short.' The 46-year-old was sacked five games into the 2013/14 season and replaced by Gus Poyet, and despite saving the club from relegation the season before, De Fanti says he didn't believe Di Canio was right for the long term. He has however, pledged his support to Poyet, despite the 8-0 defeat to Southampton on Saturday. 'The biggest mistake of the club's board was not to listen to me and Valentino's suggestion not to confirm Paolo at the beginning of last season,' said De Fanti. 'Paolo was fundamental in saving the team from relegation, but not the right manager to lead what would have been a new group. Di Canio started well at Sunderland and kept the Black Cats up but was sacked early on the next season . De Fanti has pledged his support to Gus Poyet despite Sunderland's 8-0 defeat to Southampton on Saturday . 'Cracks inside the locker room were evident already then.' 'Luckily, our suggestion to take Gus was not unheard and he was able to achieve results with exactly the same team as the beginning of the season,' said De Fanti.

His Mandarin went down well in China, with one social media user describing it as 'cute' and another saying people usually focus of his receding hairline, but his 'Chinese is great'. The message, which was broadcast last night and watched by millions, came on the eve of Chinese New Year, with 2015 becoming the Year of the Sheep. Scroll down for video . Warm wishes: Prince William wished Chinese viewers a Happy New Year in a new video message broadcast last night . In the message, the Prince said he is pleased to be visiting the country to launch the Great Festival of Creativity and mark the start of the Year of Cultural Exchange. 'I'm very pleased to be visiting China soon,' he said. 'Together, the United Kingdom and China have much to celebrate about our cultural relationship - what we have in common and what we can learn from one another.' According to The Telegraph, one user of Weibo - the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - wrote: 'It was so cute when Prince William spoke Mandarin. Could he bring his little boy to China soon?' Another wrote: 'People always go on about his hairline, but his Chinese is great'. A Twitter user tweeted: 'Bloody hell watching chinese news and prince william's speaking mandarin wishing happy chinese new year!'

'Xin Nian Hao (Happy New Year)' Charles told the crowds, adding: 'I rather hope the [Chinese] Ambassador [Liu Xiaoming] will give me a tutorial after.' The Great Festival of Creativity will take place at Shanghai's Long Museum from March 2 to 4, with the Prince travelling to the city after spending time in Beijing. During the Festival, British commercial creativity and innovation will be given a platform that will put it in front of a high profile business audience from the UK, China and beyond. Travelling alone: William, pictured here in New York in December, will be without Kate for the visit to China . The Prince and the Government hope it will create opportunities for UK companies to break into one of the world's fastest growing markets. More than 500 businesses are expected to attend. Similarly, the UK-China Year of Cultural Exchange is the first to be held and is expected to give a boost to British business and commerce. Underpinned by a government-to-government agreement set out at the UK-China Summit in London last June, the exchange will showcase UK culture in China and Chinese culture in the UK. It is designed to inspire and support creative talent, stimulating collaboration between artists and creative organisations in both countries. It is the start of the Chinese Lunar New Year and the Year of the Sheep is being celebrated in style around the world. Locals and visitors alike have taken to the streets, particularly in countries where it is a public holiday, like Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Known as Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in South Korea, the 40-day festival is traditionally a time to be with family but involves spectacular dances, dangerous stunts and the traditional gifting of 'hong bao' packets. Dating back as far as the 14th century, this year's celebrations will mark the beginning of year 4713 on the Chinese calendar. It marks the beginning of a new agricultural season, as well as a new year, and is considered a time to reunite and take part in traditions intended to bring good fortune over the coming 12 months. Celebrations: Chinese folk artists perform during the opening ceremony of the Spring Festival Temple Fair in Beijing, China on February 18 . In China, this period is also known as the Spring Festival, and traditionally, it kicks off with a large meal known as the reunion dinner where dumplings and fish are served as symbols of prosperity. Families take great care to be together on this night, which is usually held on New Year's Eve. Many cities put up colourful decorations for the season and engage in celebratory parades, dancing Chinese dragons, and fire displays. The colour red is most often used, as the hue is believed to ward off evil and is associated with luck. It's also customary to wear new red clothes to symbolise a new start. The burning of paper money as an offering to ancestors is also traditional New Year activity in some areas. This year, the Tibetan New Year also falls on February 19, the same day as the Chinese Lunar New Year, which the autonomous region celebrated with a fireworks display above the Potala Palace. People also exchange red packets, called 'hong bao',, which children often open on New Year's Eve. These contain 'lucky' cash. Each country, however, typically has its own traditional foods for the celebration. One commonality is the idea of 'out with the old and in with the new.' In the lead up to the celebrations, houses are cleaned from top to bottom, with some Chinese people even taking a bath in pomelo leaves to enhance their prosperity further. Following such a bath, it's also traditional not to wash your hair during the initial days of the new year so as to not risk washing out any of your newly acquired good luck. Though widely referred to as the year of the sheep, 2015 is also known as the year of the goat, because the Chinese character is the same for both.","The Duke of Cambridge recorded a special message for Chinese television .

The process, which FIFA intend to terminate at the end of this season, has the support of the FA, Premier League, Football League and other leagues around Europe, as well as FIFA’s administrators and their players status committee. Sepp Blatter is being accused of trying to derail the emergency loan system in the Football League . But it was still rejected by the executive at their last meeting in Marrakesh with Blatter, who is perceived to have an anti-English stance, seen as the main opponent, supposedly on the grounds of competition integrity. The move affects the English game far more than anywhere else and the Football League will discuss their next move at forthcoming club and board meetings. No wonder the FA are committed to UEFA’s three-horse strategy, with Luis Figo, Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein and Michael van Praag all on the same ‘change needed’ message that ‘Anyone But Blatter’ should be the next FIFA president. Home comforts . West Ham are already gaining the benefit of renting the Olympic Stadium on very favourable terms from the 2016-17 season. The new three-and-a-half-year shirt sponsorship deal with online gaming platform Betway, which will take in the first two seasons in Stratford, is understood to be worth £6m a year. That is three times the value of their previous agreement with Alpari and the biggest commercial deal in the club’s history. West Ham will be moving into the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 season . Granovskaia the top dog . Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia, who represents Roman Abramovich on the board, must now rank above West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady as the most powerful woman in English football. Chelsea’s revamped management structure has Granovskaia in control of transfer negotiations to remarkable effect. The club made a decent profit in the last window by selling Andre Schurrle and Ryan Bertrand for top dollar and getting a loan fee for Mohamed Salah. This follows persuading Paris Saint-Germain to pay nearly £50million for David Luiz last summer.

The Welsh Rugby Union are said to have pushed the boat out for the visiting RFU council at their dinner at Celtic Manor on Thursday night — with the wives entertained at a different restaurant at the golf resort. The largess follows Welsh gratitude at having eight World Cup matches in Cardiff despite England being the tournament hosts. Dan Ashworth was forced to explain himself from the power above about his plans for 'England DNA' Meanwhile there is some frustration at England Rugby 2015 over World Cup sponsors taking their time to hand back seats they don’t want. ER 2015 want as much time as possible to sell the returned tickets, especially in difficult venues like Leicester, where the Tigers’ opposition to the matches being staged at football’s King Power Stadium is still an issue. FA technical director Dan Ashworth’s ‘England DNA’ strategy, under which all national teams from junior to senior have the same approach, was first outlined to the FA board after the World Cup and was so well received that he now has full control of the process. But the blazers on the grassroots national game board needed another talk from Ashworth to grasp what he is trying to put in place. Board chairman Roger Burden told colleagues: ‘We have heard a lot about this topic without necessarily understanding DNA. Dan Ashworth joined us to explain that it is all about keeping the coaches and playing style the same throughout the playing levels.’","Sky Sports want Frank Lampard as their next big-name signing .

"Cristiano Ronaldo could have been lining up with Lionel Messi at Barcelona had Real Madrid not held their nerve over his £80million move from Manchester United. The Portuguese was almost priced out of a switch to the capital club as Florentino Perez felt the striker was too expensive. That is the startling admission by the club's former president Ramon Calderon, who claims his successor wasn't prepared to pay United £80million for the star. Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't wanted by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez (right), claims Ramon Calderon . The Portuguese has been in flying form for the Champions League winners over the last two years . Calderon told Sky Sports that it was he who instigated initial discussions before Perez almost pulled the plug in 2009. Ronaldo's five years at the Bernabeu have been an undisputed success - topped off notably last season when he won the Champions League and Ballon d'Or. But that may never have come to happen. 'When Florentino became president and came to the club, he wanted to break (negotiations). He thought it was very expensive,' Calderon said on the Revista Show. 'He knew he was a good player but thought he wasn't worth that amount of money. That was a problem he had at the beginning with Cristiano, who knew that.' Calderon claims that Perez found the £80million price tag set by Manchester United too expensive . Ronaldo could have lined up with Lionel Messi at Barcelona but had his heart set on a move to Real Madrid . And it may have even been the case that Madrid's arch rivals Barcelona  pinched Ronaldo under their noses - but were scuppered by the player's desire to move to the Spanish capital. 'They offered him to Barcelona among other clubs. Barcelona said ""okay, we are prepared to pay what you are asking"". The important thing is that the player said ""no, Real Madrid or nothing"",' he added. 'I'm very proud that he came, very proud what he's doing. I was there at the moment the transfer could be done, anyone would have done the same.'","Cristiano Ronaldo signed for Real Madrid for £80m five years ago .

"The Football Association have rejected Tottenham Hotspur's appeal against full-back Kyle Naughton's red card for tripping Stoke's Victor Moses during Sunday's home defeat. Naughton will serve an immediate two-match ban after the appeal was dismissed by an independent regulatory commission hearing on Tuesday.

"Kieran Read blushes when asked what he made of Zinzan Brooke’s recent description of him as a ‘miracle man’. The current IRB world player of the year may be a snarling brutish figure on the pitch, feared and revered in equal measure by opponents, but off it he is humble, self-deprecating and softly-spoken. Shy even. ‘It’s high praise to hear something like that from someone like Zinzan Brooke,’ Read said on Wednesday when asked about the former All Black No 8’s comments. IRB world player of the year Kieran Read is set to start against England at Twickenham on Saturday . Read sits down to chat rugby ahead of Saturday's match with Sportsmail's Sam Peters . ‘He was someone I grew up watching and I know how much he achieved in the game. I just love playing the game and being able to express myself on the field. There are parts of my game I feel I’ve improved a lot and can add value to the team. But working miracles? No.’ Despite his humility, there is no escaping Read’s status as one of the greats of the world game. Capped 70 times already and a key figure in the All Blacks 2011 World Cup winning side, the 29-year-old will take on England at Twickenham on Saturday in the prime of his already outstanding career. Worryingly, the 6ft 4in 17st 4lb No 8 with the pace and footballing skills of a top-class centre, is pursuing a path of constant improvement. Barcelona’s gifted forward Lionel Messi, along with his All Black team-mate and captain Richie McCaw, are sources of constant inspiration for Read. ‘To me when I look at a great player it is the consistency that sets them apart,’ he said. ‘The greats are the ones who do it every week. If you look across sports someone like Lionel Messi scores goals every week, no matter who he’s playing against. Read revealed his admiration for Barcelona footballing superstar Lionel Messi . Legendary All Black No 8 Zinzan Brooke heaped praise on Read ahead of the autumn international series . ‘You have to have that mentality to start with and then once you’ve got that I think it’s about nailing your preparation and respecting every week you play. ‘That’s what I try to do. I grew up playing alongside Richie for Canterbury Crusaders and the All Blacks so it wasn’t too hard for me to switch into that kind of mind-set when you train alongside him every week. ‘I probably always had that work-rate and mentality inside myself but once you start working and training alongside someone like Richie you see the level he lives up to every week. I just want to keep on improving and keep on getting better. That drives me on every day.’ New Zealand's World Cup-winning captain Richie McCaw has been a mentor for Read throughout his career . Read knows he will be tested by England’s young pretender Billy Vunipola at Twickenham on Saturday, but after missing the first two Tests against Stuart Lancaster’s men following back-to-back concussions last summer, he is grateful just to be taking the field. He admits his wife Bridget still has concerns about the possibility of her husband sustaining the sort of head knocks that have blighted McCaw’s career and ended that of former All Black full back Leon MacDonald. ‘It was a scary time with all the nausea and dizziness,’ Read said. ‘I know (England lock) Geoff Parling is going through it at the moment. You have a heightened risk after you’ve had one concussion. ‘Even though I wasn’t showing any symptoms obviously the brain wasn’t quite right. You just get unlucky sometimes. It puts things in perspective when you have to take that time off. It makes you realise why you love playing this game and why I love being part of this team. I missed a couple of Tests and it’s not very nice when you have to watch the boys run out and you’re not part of it. Read struggled with concussion earlier this year and missed the first two Test against England in June . ‘My wife is worried I guess. But she let me do it (come back) and she knew I was being looked after by the medics. But for me there was no way I was going to put myself at risk. I’ve got a great family with two little girls now. I was never going to be risking my health in that way. I needed to make sure I was right and come back ready. I’m good to go now. Sweet as.’ Read - part of the All Black team that lost at Twickenham two years ago - returned for the third Test in Hamilton as Steve Hansen’s men completed a 3-0 series whitewash with easily their most comprehensive victory of an otherwise competitive series. But did Lancaster’s men do enough to convince an eternally cynical New Zealand rugby public that England are finally trying to embrace a more expansive game-plan? Read anchors an All Blacks rolling maul as England's Tom Wood attempted to stem the tide . ‘I think the public probably see the English as the English of old in terms of that arrogant tag and just playing a kicking game and whatever,’ Read says with a smile. ‘But on the evidence of what we’ve seen in the last couple of years they are not really like that. They’re a capable side. ‘They came with a game plan to really take it to us in June. They had chances, in the first Test especially. We respected them, certainly, from the way they had been playing. From our point of view we probably didn’t play our best but we got the job done, which is pretty important in Test matches. That’s a confidence we can take in to the game on Saturday.’ Confidence is the last thing Lancaster and his men want coursing through this particular All Blacks veins. A humble Read is quite dangerous enough. A miracle man, no less. Mike Brown can only watch as Read dives to score during New Zealand's 30-22 win at Twickenham last year .

"Real Madrid have secured the signature of the hottest teenager in world football by beating Europe's giants to Stromsgodset's Martin Odegaard. The attacking midfielder is still only 16-years-old but has commanded wages of £80,000-per-week after becoming Norway's youngest ever international in August last year aged 15. But what were the planet's biggest stars doing when they were 16, where were they playing and were they as talked-about as Odegaard? Sportsmail takes a look... Stromsgodset teenager Martin Odegaard has completed a move to Real Madrid for a fee of £2.3million . The Norwegian was unveiled to the world at Real Madrid's Valdebebas training ground on Thursday . Odegaard became the youngest player to represent his national team when he played for Norway aged 15 . Lionel Messi, 27, Barcelona . Where he was at 16: Barcelona . Messi was breaking into Barcelona's first team and at 16 made his uncompetitive debut in a friendly against Porto in Portugal. He came on in the 75th minute with the No 14 shirt on his back, brown hair flopping all over the place and long sleeves pulled over his knuckles. In that 15 minutes he almost scored twice and was making the same penetrating dribbles – although getting tackled a few more times than nowadays – and darting runs into the box. He would not make his debut in a competitive match until he was 17. Lionel Messi (left) makes his competitive debut for Barcelona against Espanyol aged 17 . Barcelona superstar Messi has gone on to become arguably the world's greatest ever player . Cristiano Ronaldo, 29, Real Madrid . Where he was at 16: Sporting Lisbon . The thin, gangly Ronaldo was already training with Sporting Lisbon's first team at 16 and on the verge of making his senior debut. Ronaldo's mother was flown in from Madeira to help ease through the homesick teenager with obvious exceptional talent. He became the first player in Sporting's history to play for their Under 16, Under 17, Under 18, B team and first team in one season although his senior league debut, where he scored twice, did not come until he had turned 17. Cristiano Ronaldo breezes past a defender after making his Sporting Lisbon first team bow at 17 . Ronaldo's (centre) incredible goal scoring feats in 2014 earned him a third Ballon d'Or award . Manuel Neuer, 28, Bayern Munich . Where he was at 16: Schalke . Typically for a goalkeeper of such tender years, Neuer was nowhere near making his first-team debut at that age. But he was in the process of working his way through every single age group of his home-town club, which he had joined at an astounding five-years-old. He would have to wait until he turned 20 to make a breakthrough into the senior side and has not looked back since. Manuel Neuer worked through every age group of his hometwon club before making his debut at 20 . Bayern Munich and Germany's 'sweeper-keeper' Neuer is now recognised as the world's best goalie . Gareth Bale, 25, Real Madrid . Where he was at 16: Southampton . The 16-year-old Bale made his debut for Southampton in the Championship, playing at left-back but scoring regularly from free kicks and attracting the attention of several top flight teams. That season he won the Welsh Sports Personality of the Year award and went on to become the Football League Young Player of the Year, before moving to Tottenham in the summer. Gareth Bale started his career at Southampton as a left-back before being transformed into a forward . Bale then became the world's most expensive player when he moved from Spurs to Real Madrid for £86million . Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, Paris Saint-Germain . Where he was at 16: Malmo . Ibrahimovic signed for Swedish club Malmo as a 15-year-old but was already being paraded around Europe a year later. He was the same incredibly cocky character he is today, famously telling Arsene Wenger he did not do trials when taken to visit the Arsenal manager. Wenger has said: 'He was 16. I asked him to have a little training session with the first team and he didn't want to do it. Do I regret it? No. I will continue to do that unless our scouts have seen the player and says, ""Look he is absolutely 100 per cent"". I trust them.' He did not, however, break into Malmo's senior team until he was 18 and moved to Ajax a year later. Zlatan Ibrahimovic refused the offer of a trial at Arsenal as a cocky 15-year-old . Ibrahimovic hasn't lost his attitude but has won league titles with six different clubs in four different countries . Luis Suarez, 27, Barcelona . Where he was at 16: Nacional . What was the precociously talented Suarez doing in his sweet 16th year? He head-butted a referee after being shown a red card and was told he would ruin his career if continued drinking and partying. He was at Uruguayan side Nacional, where he would have to wait until he was 18 to break into the senior team. Luis Suarez was warned he would ruin his career with drinking and partying as a 16-year-old . Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has grown up but not necessarily grown out of his early antics . Philipp Lahm, 31, Bayern Munich . Where he was at 16: Bayern Munich . The full-back, now often playing as a defensive midfielder, was captaining Bayern Munich's youngsters to the youth Bundesliga title, the second time he won it. Even at 16, there was never any doubt amongst those at Bayern that he would break through. Former youth coach Hermann Hummels said at the time: 'If Philipp Lahm will not make it in the Bundesliga, nobody will anymore.' He captained their B team at 17 and made his first-team debut two years later. Philipp Lahm has always been a Bayern Munich captain in the making after starring for their youth sides . Philipp Lahm's steady progression through the youth ranks led him to winning the 2014 World Cup . Wayne Rooney, 29, Manchester United . Where he was at 16: Everton . The England striker was smashing his way into Everton's senior team when he was 16. He became their second-youngest player to feature in the first team, behind Joe Royal, when he made his debut against Tottenham in August 2002. By October that season he had netted his first goals, scoring twice in a win away to Wrexham in the League Cup. But he properly introduced himself to world football when, five days before his 17th birthday, he became the youngest player to score in the Premier League with an edge-of-the-box curler sent in off the crossbar in the last minute to end Arsenal's 30-match unbeaten run. A 17-year-old Wayne Rooney announced himself to the world with a wonder goal for Everton against Arsenal . Rooney has since gone from tempestuous firebrand to captain of England and Manchester United . Eden Hazard, 24, Chelsea . Where he was at 16: Lille . Hazard had moved from Belgium to France as a 14-year-old to develop as a player and was called up to Lille's reserve team at 16, which was competing in the fourth tier of French football, while still featuring regularly for their Under 18s. Within six months he had impressed so much he was called into the senior side for a friendly and made his league debut against Nancy from the bench that November. It would take a while before he established himself as a first-team regular. Eden Hazard shows his early promise for Belgium during an Under-17 match against Holland . Hazard was named Young Player of the Year in the Premier League last season and will one day better that . Arjen Robben, 30, Bayern Munich . Where he was at 16: Groningen . The rapid winger was already developing his trademark cut in from the right flank to score sensational strikes with his left boot in Dutch Eredivisie side Groningen at 16. He scored three times in his debut season and would eventually seal a move to PSV two years later. Arjen Robben was 16 when he made his professional debut for Eredivisie side Groningen . The Dutch winger's talents have taken him to clubs including Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich . Neymar, 22, Barcelona . Where he was at 16: Santos . The Brazilian sensation was being hotly pursued by the biggest clubs in Europe by this time. He visited Real Madrid and AC Milan and had the likes of Manchester United drooling over him. He was already commanding Santos youth matches with step-overs and skills, but opted to stay in Brazil – debuting for Santos at 17 and scoring 14 times in his first season – until he was 21. Neymar scored 14 goals in his debut season with Brazilian club Santos as a 17-year-old . Neymar left Brazil as the country's most popular sportsman and is now starring at the Nou Camp .","Norwegian teenage sensation Martin Odegaard has signed for Real Madrid .

"They could be precious exhibits in a museum or dusty relics of history from a national archive. But Bob Smethurst put together this First World War collection from more unlikely locations…fishing the discarded photographs out of rubbish bins during his 36 years as a dustman. Mr Smethurst found his first few photos and letters during the 1970s, and over the next three decades made it his mission to try to save anything of a similar nature he spotted on his rounds. He has now found more than 5,000 photographs, recording everything from the horror of the trenches to haunting images of young men smiling together before battle. Artefacts: German soldiers sent pictures like this one as postcards from the front line. This man sits next to this ammunition from 1916 . Treasure trove: Pictures like this one show the London Scottish regiment on a troop train before battle at Messines in 1914 . Horrifying: This salvaged image shows the terrible conditions from the First World War, where this trench is strewn with bodies and rubbish while servicemen watch on . Remarkable treasure trove: Dustman Bob Smethurst spent 36 years saving World War One pictures thrown away as veterans of the conflict passed away . He believes as soldiers from the conflict . grew old and died a lot of their remarkable memorabilia was often . thrown out, especially in the 1970s and 1980s. But over three decades he made it his mission to try and save anything he spotted which otherwise could have been lost forever. Mr Smethurst, from Sussex, said his collection is not just . photographs - it contains medals, letters and even a handkerchief with a bullet hole found in the rubbish. 'I found the majority of the photographs on the ""dust"" during the 70s and . 80s when those who fought in World War I were probably passing away,' he said. 'Probably the boys working today will find them from World War II. 'In . the early days we used to carry the bins on our shoulders. Therefore, . when we emptied the bins you used to see the paperwork coming out, and . the photographs. 'You didn't find them all the time because the only time you were aware of some was when they started to be mashed up. 'We . had relatives that died in both the First and Second World War and of . course it means something to keep these memories alive. Incredible: This picture, along with thousands of others, were tossed in the rubbish when the soldiers passed away, Mr Smethurst said . Men in uniform: Soldiers from all over the world served in the conflict, seen here in various uniforms before and after battle in Europe . Victims of war: This picture was found of Sidney Bell, from Canterbury in Kent, who was 'badly wounded' in the war but apparently survived the conflict . 'There is . nothing like being able to pick up and examine an object or picture, see . it with your own eyes, understand how it works and was used. If . everything is thrown away future generations will not be able to have . this joy or knowledge. 'I've got photographs from the trenches, photographs from Commonwealth Indian regiments and pictures from the Germans. 'The . German soldiers used the pictures almost like postcards, they would . write their unit and even where they were and when. The British side . weren't allowed to do that. 'I have not given a great deal of thought . about what will happen to my collection, but I do have children and . grandchildren. Not to mention several collecting friends who keep . dropping hints . 'The trouble is, if it is donated to a museum most . things will never be seen again, just stored and forgotten and no joy to . anyone.' Line-up: This group of men appear to be submariners from a torpedo team - a weapon used by both sides in the First World War . Relic: This postcard was sent by a soldier from the front line to family members in Romford, Essex. It was also found in the bin by Mr Smethurst . Ammunition: Among items that the eagle-eyed gunman has found includes this and also a handkerchief pierced by one . War wounds: This British Red Cross booklet along with these pictures of a man and his injured legs are contained in the 5,000 picture archive . Rescued from the bin: This beautifully written notebook and letter sent to 'May' on paper headed with Britannia and the motto 'For God, home, and native land' were saved . As well as being an amazing national record of the 1914-18 conflict, it . could also be worth thousands as just one picture can sell for as much . as £30 to collectors. Bob, who considers himself a custodian of the . collection, said the value for him was in saving something so important . which could otherwise have never been seen again. He said: 'I have a long . photograph like the kind that would have been in a frame hanging on a . wall of a complete squadron of the Royal Flying Corps - it was just . lying on the landfill. 'In another there's some soldiers posing with a . massive naval gun - it turned out the picture was actually taken by a . photographer from near my home. 'I actually found some letters that . were just with some papers in a bin. They were designs for the memorial . plaques for medals killed in the war. 'Having been to auctions and . postcard sales these kind of photographs used to go for 20 to 50p in the . old days. Now if you have something like a picture of a tank or . something else it can go for £30 each.' Weaponry: These wo officers stand in front of a huge tank stood in from of a crater surrounded by debris . Destroyed: Two men stand next to a damaged cannon which had sunk into the mud of the European battlefield . Powerful: Mr Smethurst spent more than three decades trying to save items like this which otherwise could have been lost forever without his intervention . Historic: Soldiers wearing kilts worn by Scottish regiments sleep or try to relax in the trenches while battle goes on around them . The hoarder has said the treasure of his . collection was a series of photographs of the London Scottish regiment, . which fought a battle at Messines in 1914. When he discovered his first letter he said: 'I looked at it, I thought it was interesting - this was the First World War. 'Once . I've undone it, I found out the chap was killed in action. This was his . last letter. I thought well hang on a minute, you can't throw that sort . of stuff away.' Alternative transport: A tank towing a field gun alongside an Indian soldier and his camel in around 1917 .

"Ten years ago, Steve Harmison was at Downing Street celebrating England’s famous Ashes victory over Australia. He was the world’s best bowler. On Tuesday night, he will be at Woodhorn Lane football ground in his hometown of Ashington, a rookie manager making his dugout debut in the Ebac Northern League. It is all a far cry from those heady days of 2005 when Harmison was a guest of the Prime Minister and one of the most famous sportsmen in the country. Former England bowler Steve Harmison has been named as manager of non-League Ashington . Harmison played a key role in helping England win the Ashes ten years ago . But football has always been his first love. His dad, Jimmy, played for Yeovil Town in the Conference and his brother, James, is now on the books of Bedlington Terriers. Growing up in the former mining town of Ashington – home to Jackie Milburn and World Cup winners Jack and Bobby Charlton – he was surrounded by footballing folklore from a young age. Harmison himself was a player under Newcastle United’s current boss, John Carver, at the club’s school of excellence during the early Nineties. In fact, the sight of the former Test star at St James’ Park – where he was honoured with a seat for life following the Ashes triumph – or on the touchline of a Northern League ground is very much a familiar one in these parts. What will be unfamiliar, however, is watching the 36-year-old patrol his technical area when ninth-tier Ashington AFC take on Bishop Auckland this evening. Harmison established himself as one of the world's best bowlers during his time in Cricket . The club's average gate is 200 but 500 are expected for the unveiling of Harmison, whose part-time role pays a token wage to cover expenses and will involve at least two weeknight training sessions and Saturday matches. But Harmison – who has the full support of wife, Hayley, and their four children – believes he has a long-term future in the game and insists his appointment is no publicity stunt. ‘Anyone who knows me understands that football has always been first,’ he tells Sportsmail ahead of his venture into management. ‘Northern League football is something I have watched since I was old enough to walk - not many people have watched more non-league games than I have. Harmison was known as the Ashington Express during his playing days and is a Newcastle fan . Harmison has taken the surprise move to go into football management following his retirement from cricket . ‘I played until I was 16 at Ashington but had to stop to concentrate on cricket. But because of my family – my dad, brother and uncles all played – I’ve always been around football dressing-rooms. ‘This opportunity presented itself and it felt right. The club has solid foundations but they needed a change with some fresh ideas and I’ve got a fantastic team with me (coaches Ian Skinner and Lee Anderson). ‘I can assure you one thing, this is anything but a publicity stunt. We are in it for the right reasons. It certainly isn’t for financial gain. ‘The club has so much going for it and we want to be part of that. I know the league and I know what’s going on. We’re in a bit of a relegation fight but I’m excited by it. ‘Who knows what the future holds for me? I’m going to start my coaching badges this summer. By that point I will have a better understanding of management and the experience of a few months in the job.’ Harmison (left) chats with Flintoff prior to Lancashire Lightning's match with Yorkshire Vikings in July 2014 . Harmison’s own playing days are behind him. Indeed, he says the club wouldn’t have a strip big enough to fit him now. But already he has been on the phone using his contacts to bring in some new faces. So what sort of manager will Harmison be? ‘If you have played a professional sport at the top level then those core values transfer – a winning mentality and demanding certain standards,’ he says. ‘I was always different in my professional career as a cricketer. If I didn’t agree with something then I would speak up, I was my own man. I will be honest with the players and will challenge them. ‘I want to build a team. I want people to come back and watch us, to make it as happy a club as it can be. This is my hometown and this means a lot to me, I want to make a difference.’ Harmison breaks off as his four kids return from school. He has tea to make and then a round of phone calls to see which players are available. ‘I’ve only got about eight fully fit players at the moment,’ he says. ‘I’ve had a text from Michael Vaughan asking “which position do you want me to play?”.’ While Vaughan may joke, Harmison is deadly serious when it comes to his new career. So who are Ashington? A non-league football club who play in the Northumberland town of Ashington, located about 15 miles north of Newcastle. Founded in 1883, they are known as 'The Colliers' and play in the Northern Football League Division One. What level is that? It is level nine on the English league pyramid - for this part of the country, the Premier League is level one, then Championship, League One, League Two, Conference, Conference North, Northern Premier League, Northern Premier League Division One North and then Ashington's league. They pit themselves against the likes of Bedlington Terriers, Whitley Bay and Sunderland Ryhope Community Association. Where do they play? At Woodthorn Lane, which has a capacity of about 2,000. The club moved there in 2008 and their record attendance for a competitive fixture is 904 for a league game with Darlington in March 2013. What are their colours? Black and white stripes, similar to Newcastle United's. Have they ever won anything? They have twice won the league below their present one and are 10 times winners of the Northumberland Senior Cup, the latest coming in 2013. Their furthest run in the FA Cup came way back in 1926-27, when they played Nottingham Forest in the third round.","Steve Harmison was recently named manager of non-league Ashington .

"The Kansas City Chiefs (1-2) will be looking to build on last Sunday’s victory in Miami as they welcome the New England Patriots (2-1) to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday. The Patriots find themselves with a winning record after the first three weeks of the season despite a couple of subpar performances. Despite a miserable performance against the Tennessee titans on the opening weekend, the Chiefs have responded in their last two games. They almost beat the formidable Broncos in week two in Denver and eased past the Dolphins last Sunday with a 34-15 victory. Quarterback Alex Smith’s statistics have been deceiving during the last two games. Smith has moved the chains with relative ease despite the obvious frailties along the Chiefs offensive line. Tom Brady will be hoping to find his top form soon after struggling for the New England Patriots . Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce gets away from Robert Lester during the game against Carolina Panthers . Standout running back Jamaal Charles remains questionable for the game. Knile Davis has filled in admirably in Charles’s absence, rushing for 211 yards and three touchdowns from 52 carries. Wideouts Dwayne Bowe and Donny Avery have both struggled to establish themselves against opposing defenses. Outside of Bowe and Avery, second year tight end Travis Kelce has caught the eye and will become a household name by the time the season is over. Expect the Chiefs to implement a game plan for Kelce, with short intermediate routes in an attempt to shy away from challenging cornerback Darrelle Revis. Rob Gronkowski celebrates his touchdown against Oakland Raiders with his team-mates . The Patriots have struggled on offense throughout the first three weeks of the season. Quarterback Tom Brady was guilty of a number of overthrows on deep routes in the opener against Miami as his offensive line crumbled around him. The three-time Super Bowl winner has improved in the last two weeks, but looks far from his usual potent self. Julian Edelman has continued where he left off in 2013 having already reeled in 22 of his 27 targets for a total of 260 yards and one touchdown. Tight end Rob Gronkowski has yet to peak following his comeback from injury. Despite a limited role, Gronk continues to be a mismatch for defenses with two touchdowns and 116 yards receiving. Kelce jumps into the air to avoid the tackle of Miami Dolphins cornerback Cortland Finnegan . Stevan Ridley runs past Minnesota Vikings' free safety Harrison Smith earlier this month . The Patriots continue to run the ball by committee via Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen. The duo have amassed 272 yards and two touchdowns so far this season. But the Patriots defense is not to be under estimated either as it finds itself ranked first overall against the pass and 10th overall against the run. The Chiefs, meanwhile, are ranked 22nd against the run and 10th against the pass. To have your say on the NFL, listen to the UK’s live call in show on Sundays from 4pm.

"Steve Harmison is used to spending his winters on tour in the tropical climes of Antigua or Australia, but on Tuesday night he was instead at home sweet home getting off to the perfect start as manager of Ashington AFC  with a 1-0 win over Bishop Auckland. Born in the town, Harmison played for the Woodhorn Lane club until 1996 before he decided to focus on a cricketing career that ended with 226 wickets in 63 Tests for England. But wearing the non-league club's jacket on top of a grey jumper, the former towering fast bowler took his seat in the dugout to lead his side to their first victory in six games and marched into the Northern League Challenge Cup quarter finals. Former Test cricketer Steve Harmison got off to a winning start as manager of Ashington AFC . The towering quick led his hometown club to victory over Bishop Auckland at Woodhorn Lane . Harmison was vocal in the dugout throughout the match as he provided encouragement for his team . 'I loved being back in the dressing room,' he said. 'But nobody outside of Ashington knew how threadbare we were today. 'But after tonight, going into the next few weeks, if we can do what we did out there today with a few players coming back, we'll be confident for the rest of the season.' Glen Taylor's header from Tony Stephenson's cross broke the deadlock 10 minutes after the break on a chilly night at Woodhorn Lane. Marc Walton could have put Harmison's side ahead after 15 minutes, but his penalty was saved by The Bishops' keeper Stephen Richardson. Never one to back down from a tough situation in a Three Lions shirt, Harmison was vocal with his players throughout the match, a fixture in his technical area spurring them on with encouragement. 'We tried to install some belief into the players. But I always knew I had some good solid characters in the side who could stand up and lead from the front,' he said. Harmison said his side had triumphed in the Northern League Cup match despite being 'threadbare' The fast bowler, who played football for his home club, says he 'loved being back in the dressing room' It was Harmison's side who had the best of the chances in a scrappy first half. Striker Walton could have put The Colliers ahead after four minutes, but his shot drifted over the bar from close range. Walton then had a chance to put the home side ahead after winger Tony Stephenson was pulled down in the box, leaving referee Will Finnie had no choice but to point to the spot. Walton stepped up but saw his effort comfortably saved by Richardson diving to his right. On a bobbly pitch, both sides struggled to string passes together and employed the long ball option regularly but the home ground advantage and support from the 'Harmy Army' gave were regularly in chorus as they tried to spur the home side to a first win in six. And the home side almost did break the deadlock when Kyle Downey was inches away from latching onto Phil Airey's low cross. The visitors had their share of chances too in the first period. Striker Andrew Johnson had their best chance, but his effort was quickly stopped by Ashington keeper Connor Grant. Harmison, who took 226 wickets in 63 Tests for England, issues instructions to the players . Wearing The Colliers' black team jacket over a grey hoodie, Harmison was all business on the sideline . Harmison is deep in thought as Ashington battle to a 1-0 victory to go through to the next round of the cup . Harmison took the attention from the media in his stride after his switch back to his first love of football . And they began well in the second half. John Butler had a great opportunity to put the visitors ahead, but his shot drifted wide of the upright. But it was Harmison's men who went ahead 10 minutes after the restart. Stephenson's right-wing cross was met by the head of Taylor from six yards. The Two Blues continued to press in search of an equaliser, but they couldn't find a way through as the Ashington defence stood firm. Butler came close to latching on to a through-ball but Grant was quickly out again to stop the danger. The home side could have had a second, but Walton's luck in front of goal didn't get any better. He first couldn't convert a rebound from a tight angle after Kyle Oliver's long range drive. And then he couldn't latch onto Taylor's cross from the right. Ashington won their first match in six starts under Harmison as the quick offered inspiration first up . Fans tuck into some warm food on a cold winter's night at the humble non-league Woodhorn Lane ground . Harmison took to the pitch at the start of the match for his obligatory scarf above the head shot . The visitors continued to try and force the game into extra time, and had a glorious chance when Kyle Davis shot wide from a late corner. The majority of the 280 fans inside Woodhorn Lane would have been pleased to see a win, while  Harmison will now focus his attentions on the league, with his side hosting Sunderland RCA in a vital relegation six-pointer on Saturday. He said: 'I think as a football club we've conducted ourselves very well with the media attention. We haven't gone and chased extra publicity or anything like that. 'But when the media have gone by next week, we'll continue and take some confidence after tonight.'","Former Test bowler Steve Harmison made debut as a football manager .

"One or two glasses of wine a day could work as well as drugs at  protecting older women from thinning bones. Regular moderate intake of alcohol after the menopause helps to maintain bone strength, according to an international review team. In comparison, they say, abstaining from alcohol leads to a higher risk of developing osteoporosis. Cheers: One or two glasses of wine a day could work as well as drugs at  protecting older women from thinning bones . Hundreds of thousands of postmenopausal women take drugs called bisphosphonates every day to combat thinning bones. But modest drinking may work as well, suggested the review published in the journal Menopause. Experts from the International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research analysed a study by researchers  at the University of Oregon that showed while women were drinking 19g of alcohol a day – about two small glasses of wine – they had a drop in loss of old bone that improved the balance between old and new bone, maintaining strength. When the women were asked to stop drinking, their 'bone turnover' went up. One reviewer said: 'The results suggest an effect of moderate alcohol consumption similar to the effects of bisphosphonates.' Sarah Leyland of the National Osteoporosis Society warned against drinking more to protect bones and said: 'Moderate amounts of alcohol might be beneficial  for bones, but excessive alcohol increases the risk of fractures, as well as increasing the risk of falls.' Alcohol appears to remedy the imbalance between the dissolving of old bone and poor production of new bone that can lead to osteoporosis in older women. Interesting results: Alcohol appears to remedy the imbalance between the dissolving of old bone and poor production of new bone that can lead to osteoporosis in older women . In comparison, abstaining from alcohol leads to a higher risk of developing osteoporosis because bone turnover accelerated again. Osteoporosis is often termed the 'silent disease' as there are no symptoms prior to a fracture. However, once a person has broken a bone, their risk of breaking another bone - a fragility fracture - increases dramatically. Around 300,000 fragility fractures occur every year in the UK, and hip fractures lead to 1,150 deaths every month. The Forum last year produced a summary of studies confirming that moderate alcohol consumption is linked with improvements in bone mineral density. It concluded that moderate consumption of alcohol - especially of beer and wine - improves bone strength in men and postmenopausal women. The latest analysis looked at a study of 40 healthy postmenopausal women aged around 56 carried out by US researchers at the University of Oregon. This meant alcohol was reducing the loss of old bone which improved the balance between old and new bone, thus maintaining strength. When the women were asked to stop drinking, their bone turnover went up. Follow up: The latest analysis looked at a study of 40 healthy postmenopausal women aged around 56 carried out by US researchers at the University of Oregon . But a day after they began drinking again, their bone turnover was once again reduced. The Forum said the study demonstrated changes at a cellular level linked to alcohol which helped explain why drinkers often had better bone strength. Other recent studies have similarly shown that moderate drinking is associated with improved bone density, although heavy drinking is linked to thinning bones. A recent study from Finland showed women drinking more than three alcoholic drinks a week had significantly higher bone density than abstainers. Professor Jonathan Powell and Dr Ravin Jugdaohsingh of the Medical Research Council Nutrition Research Group at Cambridge University, said . 'The study is novel and methods appear robust. The authors seem to know what they are doing. 'The moderate alcohol effect on bone is really quite potent. This is the 'big issue' in determining the relation of moderate alcohol intake and bone that needs resolving. 'It would be interesting to investigate just how long the levels of the bone turnover markers remain suppressed - if for 24 hours, then the regular, modest consumption (versus the 3 days a week modest consumption) debate for alcohol has some 'data' that supports the former - at least for bone.'","Regular moderate intake of alcohol after .

"Byron Moore discovered the body of his heartbroken older brother Louis Moore (pictured) on the day he signed for Port Vale FC . A professional footballer's brother hanged himself  after suspecting his girlfriend had been cheating on him, an inquest heard. Byron Moore discovered the  body of his heartbroken older brother Louis Moore, 28, on the day he signed for Port Vale FC on July 3. An inquest heard their mother received a text message from Louis saying 'I want to be alone, it's over' as Byron put pen to paper with the League One club. After rushing back from Vale Park stadium to Louis' house in Meir Hay, Staffordshire, the 26-year-old footballer discovered his brother's body. Emergency services were called to the scene at around 3pm but nothing could be done to save Louis, himself a promising athlete, who represented Great Britain as a teen. North Staffordshire Coroners Court heard Byron had also received disturbing messages from his brother earlier in the day. Giving evidence, Byron - who joined Port Vale from Crew Alexandra - said the texts suggested Louis' ex had been seeing another man before they split up. He told the inquest: 'My brother and I were really close and we would text each other most days. 'I didn't know about problems with his relationship though because he kept that stuff to himself. 'I normally spoke to him about football and things like that. 'I hadn't seen her since Christmas because she was living and working in London. 'I only knew about what happened after I had a text message from him on the day I was signing for Port Vale telling me they had split up. 'He said she had been seeing another man. It was a bit of shock. It just seemed to come of the blue. 'Later on, I had a call from my mum. An inquest heard how Jannice Mountford (pictured left) received a text message from her son Louis saying 'I want to be alone, it's over' as Byron (right) put pen to paper with Port Vale FC . 'She said she had got a text from Louis and was concerned about him.' Coroner Ian Smith concluded that Louis had taken his own life and said the revelation his former partner might have cheated on him could have been a trigger for his suicide. He said: 'Louis found a mobile device belonging to her [his ex-girlfriend] suggesting she had a relationship with someone else. 'He found out on the day and it may be that was a trigger for him to do what he did. 'Clearly he was deeply upset by losing his long-term girlfriend and then even more upset and angry at finding messages on the phone and that has tipped him over the edge.' Louis Moore and Byron Moore are pictured left and right as children in the image to the left. Louis was a talented athlete, representing Great Britain as a teen (right) Louis's former partner said in a statement that her ex had told her he had called the Samaritans because he was struggling to cope after they split up. The inquest heard Byron and his mother Jannice Mountford, 50, called at Louis's home and found the front door unlocked. Inside they found Louis's body and a note. She told the hearing: 'On the day before he died, I was due to go down to his house but he told me not to come because they were talking. 'I thought I would leave him to it and told him I would come down the next day. 'The next day, I had just about finished work when he texted me at 3.23pm saying he wanted to be on his own and that she had been with someone else and the relationship was over. 'That was the first indication I had the relationship was over.' North Staffordshire Coroners Court heard Byron Moore (pictured in white playing for Port Vale) had received disturbing messages from his brother Louis earlier in the day . Louis had once been a part of the under-13s Great Britain team whose 1997 record for the 4x100m relay race at Northwood Stadium, Staffordshire, remains unbeaten. He also excelled in long jump, high jump and pentathlon and was coached by Jim Talbot, who worked with double Olympic gold medallist Daley Thompson. After graduating from Staffordshire University with a degree in sports science he had aspirations to join the police and volunteered with Staffordshire's Special Constabulary for a year before work commitments meant he had to stop. At the time of the tragedy, Byron, who scored in the 2012 League Two play-off final for Crewe Alexandra at Wembley, said he would dedicate every goal he scores in future to his brother.","Byron Moore discovered brother Louis's body on the day he signed for Port Vale Football Club .

"Nigel Farage yesterday said he felt ‘awkward’ when he could hear no English being spoken while on a train from London to Kent. The Ukip leader described how he was on his way home when he went several stops without hearing his native tongue. His comments followed a provocative speech in which he claimed some areas of Britain are being ‘taken over’ by migrants, while others have become ‘frankly unrecognisable’. They came a day after figures showed a significant rise in net migration. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage boasted that his party would cause a 'political earthquake' by topping the polls in May's European Parliament elections . Ukip unveiled its new 'Love Britain' slogan at the conference in Torquay but it was used in 2010 by the BNP . Speaking to journalists at his party’s annual conference in Torquay, Mr Farage said: ‘It was rush hour, from Charing Cross, it was the stopper going out. We stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green. ‘It wasn’t until after we got past Grove Park that I could actually hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage. Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes. ‘I wonder what’s really going on. And I’m sure that’s a view that will be reflected by three quarters of the population, perhaps even more.’ Mr Farage insisted he was not anti-immigration but said Britain should be able to limit the ‘quality and quantity’ of migrants. While he denied wanting people to be forced to speak English, he said the challenge of integration was ‘very, very important’. Earlier, the Ukip leader attacked the main political parties for allowing ‘open door immigration’ and said this was not the legacy he wanted to leave to ‘our children and grandchildren’. In his address to the 800-strong audience, he claimed he was leading a ‘patriotic fightback’ against the EU. He predicted his party could win the European elections and pick up support in the local council elections, both in May. He even claimed he will have ‘failed’ if Ukip wins no Westminster seats at the General Election next year – and that he might resign if this happens. Mr Farage said eight in ten British people believed unrestricted immigration was ‘irresponsible’. He linked it to a doubling of youth unemployment since 2004. Mr Farage said there were 84 days until Ukip would trigger a 'political earthquake' by coming top in the European elections . This has a ‘social price’, he added. ‘The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable. 'Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don’t hear English spoken any more. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren.’ The conference, with a large international media presence, was blighted by a gaffe in which a Ukip member asked: ‘How can you possibly be a Muslim and an Englishman?’ He addressed the question to Ukip small business spokesman Amjad Bashir, and was told by officials that his views were not in line with the  party’s policy. Mr Farage was also embarrassed yesterday when it emerged his ‘Love Britain, Vote Ukip’ slogan echoes one used by the British National Party. It has promoted itself with ‘Love Britain, Vote BNP’ for several years. BNP leader Nick Griffin accused Ukip of stealing ‘our slogan and our policies’. Mr Farage tried to shrug off the association, saying people still fly the Union Flag which is also used by the far Right. But the debacle is embarrassing given the lengths to which he has gone to distance himself from the BNP, including banning former members from joining his party. Immigration figures this week showed a large increase in net migration to 212,000 last year, most of it from debt-stricken southern Europe. Mr Farage claimed Ukip had made discussing immigration 'respectable' Ukip is holding its spring conference in Torquay, where delegates can buy ties in party colours or decorated with pound signs . Mr Farage urged delegates to launch a 'patriotic fightback', while outside the conference hall British bulldogs gnawing on the EU flag were on sale . Former Tory MP Neil Hamilton, now Ukip's campaign director, and his wife Christine were among delegates . Outside the conference protesters wearing masks of Mr Farage warned of the dangers to Britain from leaving the EU .","Ukip leader predicts party will trigger political earthquake in May's election .

"Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is destined to emulate Peter Schmeichel's success at Old Trafford, according to Reds legend Paddy Crerand. Despite United's problems in defence this season, the 24-year-old has been in inspired form making several match saving contributions - prompting Crerand to claim he can become as important to the club as Schmeichel, who won 15 major trophies between 1991 and 1999. Speaking to MUTV, the 75-year-old said: 'I remember when Schmeichel first came here, he struggled a little bit with crossed balls, but he got better as he got older and was an absolutely fantastic keeper for Manchester United. This kid [De Gea] could get there no problem.' Goalkeeper David de Gea has arguably been Manchester United's best player this season .

Spain teammate Jordi Alba (left) congratulates De Gea after United keeper pulls off a save during training . De Gea no longer struggles with high balls into the box, claims United legend Paddy Crerand . De Gea drew criticism after struggling to adapt to the physical nature of the Premier League during his early United career, but Crerand insists those days are behind him. 'He's getting better and better. I remember when he first arrived - if you watch Spanish football, you never see balls being thrown into the box - so when he came here at first teams tried to make it as difficult as possible for him,' he said. 'He must have found it strange but he's improved out of all recognition - he doesn't have any problems with that type of ball into the box any more'. Crerand, pictured here with Bobby Charlton (left), was part of United's 1968 European Cup winning team . Crerand believes De Gea will go on to become as good as United's all-time great Peter Schmeichel . At only 24, De Gea has plenty of time to establish himself as an Old Trafford legend . Crerand also believes that the 24-year-old has time on his side to become one of the club's all-time greats. The 1968 European Cup winner said: 'David has been terrific for the last couple of seasons and is getting better and better. He is only 24 – that is so young for a keeper. You expect them to be at their best when they're 34, so what's he going to be like in the next five or six years? 'When do we ever have a goalkeeper as man of the match at Old Trafford? Never. It just shows you how well he's done, he's been fantastic,' he added.","Young keeper David de Gea has starred for Manchester United this season .

"Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool - Click here to read Martin Samuel's match report from the Bernabeu . The timing is not perfect, considering Jose Mourinho's rare PR gaffe with Chelsea fans this week, but Wednesday night is the time supporters from all over England should lend their allegiance to the one Premier League club who are still a Champions League threat. Ouch. On two levels. First, asking a fan to back another team tends to be a wince-inducing request in any circumstances. Second, it shows how our clubs have turned into European lightweights. Tuesday night just about summed up how far the self-labelled 'best League in the world' is skidding off the map.

The Premier League marketing men may still swear by the 'product' but over in UEFA land, English clubs are struggling with quality control. It does not help when Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers sticks two fingers up at what is supposed to be the blue riband of club football by playing his reserves at Real Madrid. Instant excuse in the event of a landslide, but at what price? Rodgers, supposedly one of the young managerial visionaries, may yet pay for a remarkably short-sighted decision. Then there is Arsenal. Oh, Arsene Wenger, why does it always happen to you? Three goals up and cruising. Final score 3-3. At home. To Anderlecht. No wonder the urbane Frenchman was uber-grumpy after that one. Chelsea players celebrate a goal during their 6-0 thrashing of Maribor at Stamford Bridge . Brendan Rodgers rested seven players against Real Madrid including Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson (left to right) Manchester United's players could play a lucrative friendly abroad with no European football to worry about . Manchester City's continuing battle to make it out of the group stages has been well documented so no-one (apart from those wearing blue-tinted spectacles) is expecting much from that quarter. They have managed to reach the knock-out phase once in three attempts. Stop tittering at the back, Manchester United fans. No European football for you but, hey, a long flight to a meaningless friendly in the Middle East after Christmas. So, thank goodness for Chelsea, then. Things are going so splendidly for Mourinho that the only thing he can moan about is the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge, which is probably not the most sensible complaint he has ever made. Library or not, the Premier League leaders are looking just the ticket in the Champions League too. England is overdue some joy in that competition. In 2014 it was Spain's turn with Atletico and Real Madrid contesting the final. La Decima went to Cristiano Ronaldo and the galacticos. The year before that it was Borussia Dortmund v Bayern Munich, a Teutonic battle settled by Arjen Robben at Wembley.

Liverpool and Chelsea enjoyed their own ding-dong series, admittedly spiced up beautifully by the fact that Mourinho and Rafa Benitez cannot stand each other. In 2008 Didier Drogba's double capped an amazing 4-3 semi-final win over Liverpool during a halcyon period for Premier League clubs. England was represented in successive finals from 2005-2009. In 2012 Roberto Di Matteo oversaw a penalty shoot-out victory over Bayern Munich while the year before that United went to Wembley only to lose to Lionel Messi-inspired Barca in the final.

Once upon a time clubs like United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea could tempt the best players in the world with a realistic promise of Champions League success to go with domestic honours. The further English clubs drop off the radar, the harder it will be to attract the world's top talent. There could well be an unwanted exodus too. Think Gareth Bale, think Ronaldo.

"It has until now been the work of science fiction and horror films, but scientists could soon be carrying out complete human head transplants, a leading surgeon has said. The procedure has previously been performed on monkeys but recent technological breakthroughs that make it possible to reconnect spinal cords could see the operation carried out on humans. Neurosurgeon Dr Sergio Canavero, from the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, believes the operation would take 100 surgeons up to 36 hours and would cost £8.5million. An Italian neurosurgeon believes doctors now have the technology to transplant human heads. The procedure, which has previously been performed on monkeys, could be used to replace one human head with another due to recent advancements in cell and nerve research that make it possible to reconnect spinal cords . The head to be transplanted would be cooled to between 12°C and 15°C. Surgeons . would then have one hour to remove both heads and reconnect the . transplant head to the circulatory system of the donor body. The spinal cord would be cut with a sharp scalpel and 'mechanically connected' to the other body. While the head is reconnected, the donor body must be chilled and put into total cardiac arrest. The donor body's heart could then be restarted once the head was reconnected. Neurosurgeon Dr Sergio Canavero believes the operation would take 100 surgeons up to 36 hours and would cost £8.5million. In 1970, American neurosurgeon Dr Robert White successfully transplanted the head of rhesus monkey onto the body of another. Then in 2001, doctors in the U.S carried out a similar operation. The monkey was able to smell, open its eyes and taste food yet because White couldn't reconnect the animal's spinal cord, it was left paralysed and died hours after surgery. More recent advancements in cell and nerve research could make reconnecting spinal cords possible and Canavero believes this means there is no longer a barrier when it comes to transplanting human heads. In a paper, published by Surgical Neurology International, Canavero said: 'The greatest technical hurdle to cephalosomatic linkage [head transplant] is of course the reconnection of the donor’s and recipients spinal cords. 'It is my contention that the technology only now exists for such linkage.' He adds that the procedure would be similar to that used in previous experiments. Both parties would be put to sleep. In 1970, an American neurosurgeon successfully transplanted the head of rhesus monkey onto the body of another, pictured. Later, in 2001, doctors in the U.S carried out a similar operation. The monkey was able to smell, open its eyes and taste food yet because doctors couldn't reconnect the animal's spinal cord, it died . The head to be transplanted would be cooled to between 12°C and 15°C. Surgeons would then have one hour to remove both heads and reconnect the transplant head to the circulatory system of the donor body. The operation would have to be carried out within this time because an hour is the longest a human brain can survive without a steady flow of blood and oxygen. Boris Karloff in the 1931 horror film Frankenstein. Plans put forward by Canavero could lead to Frankenstein-style head and body transplants . Canavero explains in his paper that the spinal cord would have to be cut with a sharp scalpel and would need to be 'mechanically connected' to the other body. In his paper, Canavero proposes cutting . spinal cords with an extremely sharp knife, then mechanically connecting . the spinal cord from one head to another body. He said: 'It is this 'clean cut' [which is] the . key to spinal cord fusion, in that it allows proximally severed axons to . be ‘fused’ with their distal counterparts. This fusion exploits . so-called fusogens/sealants….[which] are able to immediately . reconstitute (fuse/repair) cell membranes damaged by mechanical injury, . independent of any known endogenous sealing mechanism.' While the head is reconnected, the donor body must be chilled and put into total cardiac arrest. The donor body's heart could then be restarted once the head was reconnected. A head to body spinal connection hasn't been attempted yet, but Canavero cites previous studies where scientists have reconnected a spinal cord to a rat. In those experiments the rat was given limited movement. Canavero also cites studies in which plastics such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been used to reconnect a severed spinal cords in dogs.","Dr Sergio Canavero says we now have the technology to replace one person's head with another by reconnecting spinal cords .
The procedure involves the same methods used to successfully transplant the head of a monkey .

'Several human diseases without cure might benefit from it,' he says ."
"The Earth's outermost shell is constantly moving, dragging continents apart and pushing them together. But exactly what caused this colossal movement three billion years ago has been a mystery. Now, researchers in Australia believe they have the answer: the motion, they claim, started because of gravity. This animation shows an early buoyant continent slowly spreading toward the still plate (blue). After 45 million years, a short-lived area develops, where the plate goes under. This allows the continent to surge toward the ocean, leading to the detachment of a continental block and triggering modern-day plate tectonics . Scientists at Sydney University suggest that whole continents flattened out under their own weight, and this eventually became a self-sustaining process. The team has created computer models to explain how layered rocks can appear on a young, hot Earth, even without modern plate tectonics . There are eight major tectonic plates that move above the Earth's mantle at rates up to 150 millimetres every year. The process involves plates being dragged into the mantle at certain points and moving away from each other at others, in what has been dubbed 'the conveyor belt'. University of Sydney's cmputer models suggest that these spreading early continents would have imposed an horizontal stress strong enough to force adaject plates to be pushed under their edges . As plates spread out under their own weight, they would begin to melt on the bottom, due to the heat below . This would trigger a subduction - the process that takes place at boundaries by which one tectonic plate moves under another tectonic plate and sinks into the mantle as the plates converge . When plates smash together, they make mountains, and when they spread apart, molten rock comes to the surface and makes new crust. Scientists at suggest that whole continents flattened out under their own weight. This is because early continents could have placed major stress on the surrounding plates. Because they were buoyant they spread horizontally, forcing adjacent plates to be pushed under at their edges. This spreading of the early continents could have produced intermittent episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and its crust and plate mantle became heavier. Plate tectonics became a self-sustaining process which has never ceased and has shaped the face of our modern planet. The movement depends on the relationship between density of rocks and temperature. For instance, at mid-oceanic ridges, rocks are hot and their density is low, making them buoyant or more able to float. As they move away from those ridges they cool down and their density increases until, where they become denser than the underlying hot mantle, they sink and are 'dragged' under. But three to four billion years ago, the Earth's interior was hotter, volcanic activity was more prominent and tectonic plates did not become cold and dense enough to spontaneously sink. 'So the driving engine for plate tectonics didn't exist,' explained Associate Professor Patrice Rey, from the University of Sydney's School of Geosciences. 'Instead, thick and buoyant early continents erupted in the middle of immobile plates. When plates smash together, they make mountains such as the Himalayas (pictured), and when they spread apart, molten rock comes makes new crust. But what triggered this process had been a mystery . 'Our modelling shows that these early continents could have placed major stress on the surrounding plates. 'Because they were buoyant they spread horizontally, forcing adjacent plates to be pushed under at their edges.' 'This spreading of the early continents could have produced intermittent episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and its crust and plate mantle became heavier. 'Plate tectonics became a self-sustaining process which has never ceased and has shaped the face of our modern planet.' The Earth's outermost shell is constantly moving, dragging continents apart and pushing them together. Pictured is the fault in the landscape caused by continental drift between North American and Eurasian tectonic plates at Thingvellir National Park near Reykjavik, Iceland .","Computer models show how continents placed stress on surroundings .

"Ander Herrera is poised to become Louis van Gaal's first signing at Manchester United for the sum of £28.4million. The Athletico Bilbao midfielder was on the Premier League club's radar last summer, but new manager Van Gaal has breathed new life into the deal. Here, Sportsmail's Pete Jenson explains exactly what Man United can expect to get for their money. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a Holland fan get Louis van Gaal tattooed on his back... Incoming: Ander Herrera is poised to become Louis van Gaal's first signing at Manchester United for £28.4million . Born: Bilbao, Spain, August 14 1989 (24) LEAGUE CAREER . 2008-2009: Zaragoza B (10 apps, 2 goals) 2009-2011: Zaragoza (82 apps, 6 goals) 2011-NOW: Athletico Bilbao (94 apps, 7 goals) INTERNATIONAL CAREER . 2009-2009: Spain U20 (10 caps, 3 goals) 2009-2011: Spain U21 (15 caps, 4 goals) 2012-NOW: Spain U23 (5 caps, 0 goals) What are United getting for their money? Someone who knows how to get a team into the Champions League. He did it last season at Athletic Bilbao and they will be confident he can do it again. So he is a leader? He has the character that a club looking to rebuild will need. He’s honest, fiercely committed and loyal. There was evidence of that last season when United moved too late in the transfer window to get him and the only way the deal was going to happen is if he forced his way out of Athletic Bilbao. Ed Woodward gambled on Athletic lowering their buy-out clause – something that he should have known they never do – and only if Herrera had put in a transfer request and started a war was the deal going to go through. Out of respect to Athletic he wouldn’t do it. He wanted to go to United but he wanted the transfer to be done properly. And when it didn’t happen he didn’t sulk he got down to the business of helping Athletic Bilbao qualify for the Champions League. That’s the kind of man he is. Tackle: Herrera (right) puts a foot in on Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez in a La Liga clash . Winner: Herrera beats Sanchez to a header during the La Liga match at the illustrious Nou Camp . 1. £37.1mi - Juan Mata from Chelsea in January 2014 . 2. £30.75m - Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham in September 2008 . 3. £29.3m - Rio Ferdinand from Leeds United in July 2002 . 4. £28.1m - Juan Sebastian Veron from Lazio in July 2001 . 5. £27.5m - Marouane Fellaini from Everton in September 2013 . And he was successful? He was and it wasn’t isn’t easy. Because of the rise of Atletico Madrid there was only one place up for grabs and Athletic beat Valencia, Sevilla and Real Sociedad to the punch largely thanks to Herrera’s leadership and his five goals and five assists from midfield. Where did he play? He usually operated in a midfield three slightly ahead of two holding players but United fans need not be concerned that they have bought another number 10 because he can comfortably operate slightly deeper, building the play. He has the vision and the passing for the role and he’s also tough. Can he help make Old Trafford a fortress again? Athletic Bilbao went until mid-february last season without losing at home. Barcelona turned up in November on a roll and were rolled out of town empty handed. Both Andres Iniesta and Xavi were taken off and Herrera was one of the best players on the pitch. Real Madrid also failed to win there. Performer: Barcelona played Athletico Bilbao in November and left empty handed, with Herrera a star player . How will he fit in? There is a Juan Mata connection that United fans should be excited about. The two played together when Spain won the U-21 Euros in Denmark in 2011. Ander scored the all-important first goal with a header and helped mesmerize the Swiss opposition in the Aarhus Stadium linking brilliantly with Thiago Alcantara and with Mata. Why hasn’t he stepped up? He has had to wait for the changing of the guard. With Xavi and Xabi on their way out the path opens up for Ander. Vicente del Bosque spoke after the win over Australia about the future being bright – Herrera, along with Bayern Munich’s Thiago and Atletico Madrid’s Koke, is one of the reasons why. But Koke went to the World Cup and Thiago would have gone had he not got injured so are United getting the 3rd best option? There is no shame being left out of Spain’s squad of midfielders. Real Madrid spent 30m euros on Asier Illaramendi last summer and he’s nowhere near the squad. Ander will be far better value than Illaramendi. He can defend, the can attack, he keeps the ball, and he wins it back when it’s been lost. Foes to friends: Manchester United's Ryan Giggs battles with Herrera for the ball at Old Trafford in 2012 . He’s a slow burner, but that often beats an overnight sensation. He’s had to work hard to get recognition at unfashionable Zaragoza. Athletic Bilbao wanted him as a kid but he stayed loyal to Zaragoza. Eventually they got him, for 8m back in 2011. Then it was their turn to fight to hold on to him. Now they have lost that battle and he’s a United player. Van Gaal will approve? You don’t think United dare sign him without Van Gaal’s approval? The Dutchman had a reputation at Bayern Munich for being offered players by directors Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinze Rummenigge and telling them ‘no’, ‘no’, ‘no’. He will have said yes to Herrera and he will have said yes for a reason – he’s a midfield soldier, with the flair to find the passes that will release Mata, Rooney and Van Persie and with the stomach for a Premier League battle.

"Sheffield United risked a fierce backlash on Tuesday night by confirming that they have agreed to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to return and take part in training at the club. The PFA are behind the move that will see Evans take a step closer to resuming his professional career following his release from prison last month after serving half of a five-year sentence. It is understood that the 25-year-old former Wales striker, who earned £20,000 a week at Bramall Lane before his conviction in April 2012, will not be paid by Sheffield United. Read the statement below . Rapist Ched Evans will start training with his former club Sheffield United this week despite 150,000 people demanding the club turn him away . Evans is to marry his fiancee Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison, where he served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl . The League One club insist that the move is designed to allow Evans to regain fitness and declined to say whether he will rejoin them permanently. But it is bound to attract strong criticism and campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition spokeswoman Sarah Green said: ‘We are appalled that top football club Sheffield United are taking the first step to allowing an unrepentant convicted rapist back into their team this week.’ United cancelled their press conference for Wednesday night's Johnstone’s Paint Trophy match against Walsall at short notice and issued a lengthy statement on Tuesday evening. Sheffield United Football Club acknowledges the public discussion on the potential return of its former player, Mr Ched Evans, to professional football following the completion of the custodial portion of his sentence for rape in the courts of England and Wales. While some have speculated about whether the Club will or should invite Mr Evans to return to SUFC as a registered footballer, the Club is not prepared at this time to decide that issue. The Club also acknowledges receipt of a request from The Professional Footballers' Association ('The PFA') to the effect that the Club consider allowing Mr Evans, who is a PFA member, to train at the Club's facilities. According to the request, this training would be with a view to enabling Mr Evans to get back to a level of fitness, which might enable him to find employment in his chosen trade. This request has come to the Club, because it is the last club at which Mr Evans was registered before his conviction. In response to The PFA's request, the SUFC Board of Directors has deliberated the matter internally, taking into consideration: . Evans warms up at the Millennium Stadium ahead of Wales' Euro 2012 qualifier against England in 2011 . In the course of its deliberations, the Board also spoke with Mr Evans and his representatives. After due consideration, the Board has decided to respond favourably to The PFA's request and to allow Mr Evans to train at the Club's facilities. This decision, which takes effect immediately, is informed by the following four considerations: . Evans had been serving at HMP Wymott prison in Lancashire but was released earlier this month . (The Club recognises that the same justice system that tried, convicted and punished Mr Evans under law also provides for his rehabilitation under law.) Apart from this statement, the Club will not be making any further comments about this matter for the foreseeable future. It is thought Evans, pictured with Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail . Man City (2007-09): 16 games, 1 goal . Norwich (loan, 2007-08): 28 games, 10 goals . Sheff Utd (2009-12): 103 games, 42 goals . Wales (2008-11): 13 games, 1 goal . It read: ‘After due consideration, the Board has decided to respond favourably to the PFA’s request and to allow Mr Evans to train at the club’s facilities. ‘While some have speculated about whether the club will or should invite Mr Evans to return to SUFC as a registered footballer, the club is not prepared at this time to decide that issue.’ The statement went on to say that ‘the club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms’ and ‘does not question Mr Evans’ conviction for rape’ but ‘there can be no place for mob justice’. Massey, pictured with Evans last week, is said to be 'over the moon' after he proposed to her . Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side' More than 150,000 people have signed a petition urging Sheffield United not to re-sign Evans. The Football League also issued a statement on Tuesday night admitting that they would have no choice but to register him as a player if any club wanted to sign him. It went on: ‘Ultimately the choice of whether to engage a player that has been released from a custodial sentence will be one for individual clubs who… will have to make their own assessment of the potential consequences for their public reputation and business affairs, as well as the relationship they have with their own supporters.’ Evans has always denied raping the 19-year-old woman in front of friends at a Rhyl hotel in May 2011. He has vowed to clear his name but it could take up to three months before his application to appeal is heard by the Criminal Case Review Commission.","Sheffield United say there can be no place for 'mob justice' over Ched Evans .

"Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has spoken of his sadness following the death of his brother Ibrahim and suggested that his club did not offer him sufficient support during a period which he describes as 'the hardest in my life.' The Ivory Coast midfielder's 28-year-old brother tragically died of cancer last week, while Yaya was in Brazil representing his country at the World Cup and the City talisman has stated that he felt disappointed that he wasn't afforded greater sensitivity by his club employers. The full squad were required for a post-season trip to Abu Dhabi, where City played a friendly game and met the club's owners. On the ball: Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure in training ahead of Ivory Coast's final Group C clash . International duty: Toure's brother Ibrahim died in Manchester while Yaya was playing at the World Cup in Brazil . Tragedy: The Ivorian FA informed confirmed that . Ibrahim Toure, pictured here playing in Beirut in October, died in . Manchester where he was being treated for cancer. He was aged 28. Toure told France Football: . 'At the end of the season, I wanted to stay for four or five days with . my brother before I flew to prepare for the World Cup with Ivory Coast, . except that City did not want to grant me a few days. 'I went to celebrate the title championship in Abu Dhabi while my . brother was lying in his sickbed. By fortune, Kolo was at his bedside. After that I blame myself for not insisting and for not making them . respect me. 'However, . club officials knew very well that I was suffering for a few months as . the health of my brother declined. This is the reason I had several . injuries at the end of the season, because my head had taken control of . my body. These last four months have probably been the hardest in my . life.'

City are believed to have pledged their unequivocal support to the . family in the past week, with the club maintaining dialogue with former . player Kolo Toure and brother Yaya, contributing to the arrangements for . the funeral and even assisting with the paperwork. Before Ibrahim died, he was also invited to the club's Carrington training ground as a special guest. A well-placed source stated: 'It is what we do for our players. They will always have our support.' It . should be noted that City, although a little bemused, do not view this . latest development in their relationship with Toure as a major sticking . point. It is understood . that there has been no conflict since the bizarre episode that saw Toure . throw his future at the club into doubt when his agent Dimitri Seluk . claimed that the club should have made more of a fuss for his 31st . birthday, with his representative said that the midfielder was left . 'very upset'. City did . give Toure a birthday cake and wished him happy birthday on Twitter but . the player's agent suggested he was ignored by the club's Abu Dhabi . owners when the squad visited at then end of the season.

"This is the jaw-dropping hidden utopia that a Bradford couple chanced upon on holiday. The underground cave is showered with sunlight that pours through two huge entrances, allowing trees up to 50 metres tall to flourish. Tucked behind a mountain in Vietnam, Son Doong - meaning river mountain - has sat peacefully under the human radar for as long as records can show. Caves are defined as 'big enough for a human to fit inside'. Towering above its minuscule explorers, this cave has shocked nature experts. Harold Limbert pictured at a massive entrance to the cave. Married couple Howard and Deb Limbert have opened up the amazing Son Doong cave, the largest cave in the world, to adventure tourists after discovering it in 2009 . The couple heard about the cave from a local man who had taken shelter from a storm in the entrance to Son Doong, in the mountains of Quang Binh 20 years ago . The first public tour in August 2013 camps on the floor of the cave. Mr and Mrs Limbert were joined by six tourists, 16 porters, two UK guides, a Vietnamese English-speaking guide, two National Park rangers and a porter manager . Measuring 5.5 miles long, it is home to a . lush green forest, cascading waterfalls, giant stalagmites and stalactites and . a river. The cavern is so large, a 40-story skyscraper could fit within its . walls. The luscious underground forest is home to . all sorts of cave-dwelling creatures from flying foxes to monkeys. The cave was first explored in 2009 by . Howard Limbert, 56, and his wife Deb, 53. The couple, who met at a school caving club, took a gamble four years ago when they dropped their NHS jobs in Bradford to travel the world in . search of new and exciting caves. They heard about the cave from a local man, Ho Khanh, who had taken shelter . from a storm in the entrance to Son Doong, in the mountains of Quang Binh in . Vietnam 20 years ago. Rare 'cave pearls', calcium formations, on the floor of the cave. Mr Limbert said: 'Son Doong is unlike any other cave on the planet. We were so lucky to have the chance of being the first people to see this new wonder of the world.' He heard the sounds of a powerful river . and rushing wind, but was too afraid to venture further in. Mr Khanh told the Limberts about his . discovery when he led them as a guide through the Vietnamese mountains in 2009. Mr Limbert said: 'Son Doong is unlike any . other cave on the planet. 'We were so lucky to have the chance . of being the first people to see this new wonder of the world. 'It is always very exciting to . explore somewhere where no one has ever visited, but to have the chance to . explore Son Doong was very special indeed.' Howard and Deb Limbert, in the foreground, look on as a tourgroup member explores the cave in the distance. The couple have been overwhelmed by requests to join expeditions into the world's largest cave and expect all 220 places on tours next year to be snapped up fast . Members of a tour party cross a river in the cave. The couple used to work for the NHS as biomedical scientists and spent most their holidays on caving expeditions . The couple, married for 34 years, relocated to Vietnam . permanently and set up a business leading tour groups to the heart of the cave. There have now been 25 specialised expeditions into . Son Doong since the cave was first discovered. And last month, in a groundbreaking adventure, Mr and Mrs Limbert led the first public tour. Six tourists went on the . first trip, accompanied by 16 porters, two UK guides, a . Vietnamese English-speaking guide, two National Park rangers and a porter . manager. To enter Son Doong the group of . international tourists from Britain, Australia, the USA and Norway, had to . abseil down through the thick forest under the caves entrance. Mr Limbert said: 'We have probably lived . in the cave now for over four months in total. 'The tour is incredibly popular and . all clients taken so far say it is the greatest adventure on the planet.'

They have moved permanently to Vietnam to continue their exploration . The couple used to work for the NHS as . biomedical scientists and spent most their holidays on caving expeditions. Mr Limbert said: 'We have both been . exploring caves for most of our adult life and it has enabled us to visit some . wonderful places in the world and meet some fantastic people. We are lucky that . we both have the same interest. 'We explored the caves of the UK . during our first few years of caving and still continue to explore the . fascinating caves of Britain. 'We caved in Europe and then later in . Mexico, Borneo, Australia and New Zealand. 'We first visited Vietnam on a caving . expedition in 1990 and now we have explored over 200m of new unexplored caves . during the last 23 years of our work in the country.' The intrepid couple believe there may be a . larger cave for them to discover yet. Mr Limbert said: 'We still believe that . an even larger cave could be found in the remote mountains in central Vietnam. 'We are leading an expedition of . British cavers in March and April next year to continue our work in the area . and hopefully find another cave larger than Son Doong if that is possible. 'We have only explored around a . quarter of the remote mountains and our guides have found many entrances for us . to visit.

"A popular barman with British parents and sisters who has worked in the UK for 12 years has been forced to return to his native Philippines because his visa ran out. Fredel Buenavista, 32, left the country in south east Asia at the age of four and arrived in Britain when he was 20 with his stepfather Alan Pratt and his mother Maria, who are both British citizens. But earlier this month Mr Buenavista, from Maidstone, Kent, was detained by the Home Office earlier this month and threatened with deportation. Scroll down for video . Popular: Barman Fredel Buenavista, 32, has British parents and sisters, and has worked in the UK for 12 years but had to return to his native Philippines because his visa ran out, despite a campaign from his customers . Upheaval: Mr Buenavista, with his mother Maria, sisters Sophia and Sarah and stepfather Alan, went to school and university in Britain, having arrived on a student visa, but the Home Office say he never had a work permit . Around 3,000 people signed a petition calling for immigration officials to change their minds, and his MP promised to take the fight 'to the highest level'. His deportation was then delayed on compassionate grounds earlier this month as Mr Pratt underwent major stomach surgery. However, on Monday evening Mr Buenavista- known as Fred - gave up his fight and voluntarily flew himself back to the Philippines. By leaving of his own accord he is eligible to apply for a new visa after 12 months, as opposed to 10 years if he had been deported. Support: Regulars at the Royal Albion in Maidstone, where Mr Buenavista works raised more than £1,000 for his new life alone . Fond farewell: Mr Buenavista's manager at the Royal Albion pub, Karan Le Quelenec, said the barman had 'done everything by the book', but was 'being made an example of' Friend: Mr Buenavista's friend Dustin Burton set up a Facebook page to help support his claim to stay in the UK . Regulars at the Royal Albion in Maidstone, where Mr Buenavista works raised more than £1,000 for his new life alone. Speaking before he left Britain, Mr Buenavista said: 'It’s not right, it’s not fair. They are getting rid of someone who is working and supporting the community. 'It’s starting from scratch. I feel lonely and depressed, I have never lived alone before. I’m trying not to see people to make it easy on myself to leave.' He added: 'I must have done something right in life and been raised well for this many people to care.' Mr Buenavista, who has two younger British sisters, returned to the Philippines with his mother who will stay with him for four weeks before flying back to Britain. Leave to remain: Mr Buenavista's deportation was then delayed on compassionate grounds earlier this month as Mr Pratt underwent major stomach surgery . Desperate to stay together: Mrs Pratt (left) said her family, including (left to right) children Sarah, Fred and Sophia, had not been apart in 32 years . Hopeful: By leaving of his own accord Mr Buenavista is eligible to apply for a new visa after 12 months, as opposed to 10 years if he had been deported . 'It is the first time in 32 years the family will be apart,' she said. 'Not together for Christmas or New Year or birthdays.' Mr Pratt, 68, said: 'He is going to have to steer a different path now. Especially to his mother and sisters, he’s their life. 'When I’m not here he’s the one they all turn to. It just doesn’t seem right being able to break a family apart like this.' Close ties: Mr Buenavista enjoys his final moments with his mother and younger sisters . After leaving the Philippines as a young boy, Mr Buenavista lived in New Zealand with his family before arriving in the UK and went to school in Dartford and university in Surrey before starting work. He came here on a student visa and later applied for a work permit, which the Home Office said was never granted. He was thrown into an immigration detention centre after he failed to appeal the decision to remove him from the UK. But campaigners say this was only because of inaccurate legal advice. His manager at the pub Karan Le Quelenec said: 'He’s done everything by the book and he’s been made an example of. 'Had he not signed in and done everything properly he’d still be here. 'He’s been made a scapegoat for their facts and figures at the end of the year. It’s just not justice.' She told how Mr Buenavista went to a local police station to sign in as requested by the Home Office every two weeks, not knowing he was about to be detained. His step-father waited outside in his car for two hours but he never came out. The next time the family heard from him was when he called Mr Pratt from the detention centre in Dover. Before his departure Tracey Crouch, Tory MP for Chatham and Aylesford, said: 'I have taken this to the highest level and have requested an immediate stop on his deportation until I have had the opportunity to speak to the immigration minister about his decision.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules. 'When someone has no right to be here, we expect them to leave the country voluntarily. Where they do not we will seek to enforce their departure.'","Fredel Buenavista, 32, left the country in south east Asia at the age of four .

"It is usually used for helping insomniacs get some much-needed sleep. But in a miraculous twist, Ambien is believed to have woken up 23-year-old Sam Goddard after he suffered a series of strokes that left him in a coma. Sam, from Brisbane, Australia, was playing football in February 2010 when his head began to pound so severely he screamed for an ambulance. Scroll down for video . Unknown cause: Sam Goddard, 24, from Brisbane, Australia, suffered eight strokes in February 2010. Doctors believed he would be in a vegetative state for the rest of his . life - but he has stunned them by speaking . Doctors told his family and fiancée, Sally Jane Nielson, he had suffered a staggering eight strokes, leaving him with permanent brain damage. They warned the family Sam, now 24, would be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life, Sally told MSNBC’s Rock Center. ‘They said he would be a vegetable,’ she recounted. ‘There was actually a doctor that told us that we would be better off letting Sam contract an infection, put him in a home and just let him die.’ Sam would never be able to walk, talk or recognise his loved ones, and would likely be blind, doctors said. Plans: Sam and his fiancee Sally Jane Nielson were supposed to marry in May - three months after the strokes . Active: Sam Goddard was healthy and fit - and doctors are uncertain why he suffered the devastating strokes . No hope: After the strokes, Sam was in a coma in the ICU for 45 days. Doctors told the family there was no hope of recovery and they should let him contract an infection, move . him to a home and let him die, his finacee said . But Sally refused to give up on her boyfriend of four years, whom she had been planning to marry three months later. On the day of her planned wedding, Sally said the struggle momentarily became too much. ‘I didn't cope very well at all and I actually completely lost it,’ she told ABC. ‘I'd say I probably had a nervous breakdown. ‘But I picked myself up pretty quickly after that, dusted myself off because what I was going through was nothing compared to what Sam was going through, nothing at all.’ After . 45 days in a coma in the Intensive Care Unit at Royal Brisbane Hospital . – where he also contracted pneumonia – Sam woke up and began making . slow progress. With intense therapy, he began walking, but was still unable to speak or function alone. He could only moan and had the brain function of a young child. Determined: But his fiancee Sally, pictured, refused to give up hope. She researched options on the internet and found that sleeping pill Ambien had . helped other stroke sufferers regain speech and movement in the past . Recovery: Sam can now speak after taking the pills. Sally has quit her job to look after him full time . Devoted: The drugs wear off after an hour, at which point Sam's speech becomes unintelligible again . Desperate to help her fiancé, Sally . turned to the internet, where she found a video of another young stroke . sufferer feeding himself and talking – thanks to doses of the sleeping . aid Ambien. Ambien, also called Stilnox, is a prescription medicine used to treat insomnia by initiating sleep. It contains Zolpidem, which studies have . found increases blood flow in the brain, particularly in areas involved in . language comprehension - allowing improved function. Studies into the connection between stroke rehabilitation and Ambien are ongoing. John White at Moss Rehabilitation Center in Philadelphia is leading a study into the connection. So far he has found that fewer than 10 per cent of stroke victims respond to the drug - and that Sam's case is extremely rare. 'We’re not able to yet advise families on how to use this drug clinically because the research is in the very early stages,' he told MSNBC. ‘It just blew my mind,’ said Sally, who then pleaded with doctors to give the drug to her fiancé. They refused, citing the lack of studies into the connection. ‘They almost laughed at us really. They didn’t think it was possible that a sleeping pill could awaken someone. But I felt compelled to.’ So Sally lied, saying Sam needed the pills to sleep and just days later, after a year of only being able to moan unintelligible sounds, he did the impossible – he began to talk. He immediately phoned his parents and left them a message. 'There was Sam saying, ""I’m talking, I’m talking"". It was unbelievable', his father John Goddard told MSNBC. While Sam's speech remains slurred and . slow, it allowed doctors and family to realise his brain had been . functioning the whole time – and he had just been unable to express himself. On being able to speak again, he 'felt like shouting it from the rooftops', Sam told Rock Center. 'That’s the best part about the Ambien,' Sally said. 'It shows what I believed was true – he was really in there.' Sam takes four doses of Ambien a day, but it only lasts an hour or less. Future: They still hope to marry. Doctors continue to research the connection between strokes and Ambien . ‘It is very difficult to comprehend the fact that I can talk now and in an hour or I won’t be able to talk at all,’ Sam told MSNBC. ‘It really sucks.’ Doctors at the Moss Rehabilitation Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania are now carrying out research into Ambien’s effectiveness in stroke patients' progress. Sally now cares for her husband-to-be full time, and is still certain she will walk down the aisle one day. ‘A lot of people expected me to walk away,’ Sally said. ‘But they just didn’t realise our connection isn’t broken, it’s stronger than anything I’ve ever known before. ‘I wouldn’t be me without him. I’d be heartbroken.’ See below for video .

"Appropriate dress: The UAE prefers people in public to cover up, including shoulders and knees . Advice cards ordering shoppers to cover up at a Dubai shopping mall have been branded 'unfair' and 'humiliating' by tourists and ex-pats. In the latest crackdown on those who flout the United Arab Emirates' strict dress code, security guards at Dubai Marina Mall, have been handing out the cards to men and women who are deemed to be dressed inappropriately. The blue cards tell customers to wear 'respectful clothing' that covers the shoulders and knees at all times. The cards also explain what is considered acceptable clothing, and what is not. Although signs asking shoppers to follow the dress code have been put up at the mall's entrances, staff say they are either not being read, or people are deliberately ignoring them. One employee, who asked not to be named, said: 'We put up a lot of posters, but everyone ignores them, This is the only way to tell people directly.' According to The National, 'dozens of women' at the mall yesterday were breaching the rules by showing off their shoulders and knees. Although Laura Gates, from the UK, was wearing a dress which exposed her shoulders, she had not been handed a card. She said: 'I don’t think I’m breaking any rules. I’m not wearing beachwear, that’s why no one has said anything.' An Australian shopper, who asked only to be named as Christiana, said she thought the rule unfairly targeted women. She added: 'I see men walking around in shorts all the time, but women can’t do the same. That doesn’t seem fair.' Reminder: Dubai has strict policies when it comes to dress, and baring shoulders and knees is inappropriate . Lucia di Domenico, from the US, believed it would be humiliating to be told directly that they were inappropriately dressed. She said: 'I would be very embarrassed if they said that. I don’t think I’d want to come back to the mall if they treat people like that.' Another employee at the mall, who declined to be named, said the rule was applied only for the most flagrant breaches. They said: 'We only give it to those people who are dressed totally unacceptably. This is Dubai’s rules, not just the rules of the mall.' Emaar, which operates Dubai Marina . Mall and the Dubai Mall, declined to comment. But the issue of . inappropriate clothing remains a key talking point. Last . year Emiratis Asma Al Muhairi and Hanan Al Rayes launched Twitter page . @UAEDressCode, which regularly posts on issues of modest dress in public . places, and now has 4,600 followers. Cover up: Tourists flock to Dubai in droves, but one shopping centre is ordering them to dress appropriately . Cultural adviser and columnist for The National, Ali Al Saloom, said the problem was due to a lack of clarity over what constituted 'disrespectful' dress. He said: 'It’s always a grey area on how to judge it, on what’s okay and what’s not okay. 'We keep hoping that people would kindly understand that when you’re revealing a lot of skin, like a short skirt or showing your shoulder or chest, this would definitely be considered not modest. 'This goes for everyone, including men.' Mr Al Saloom insisted the Marina Mall initiative was 'just an extra reminder, on top of all the other many reminders', and claimed that tougher rules needed to be introduced. He added: 'Everything can be solved easily if the mall didn’t let people inappropriately dressed people enter in the first place.'","Security guards handing out advice cards to those dressed inappropriately .

"Lurking in the streets of central New Delhi are a group of men who are being paid good money to do nothing more than just ape about... literally. With their faces painted grey and white, they have adopted the antics of the langur species of monkey in order to scare away their pesky macaque cousins which break into houses, steal food and scare the living daylights out of residents. So the New Delhi Municipal Council has decided to turn the tables and put the frighteners into the cheeky raiders by setting the more ferocious langur monkeys onto them - even if they are only men in disguise.

According to the Times of India, the men - who not only disguise themselves as langurs but have also learned to shriek like them - leap out from behind bushes and trees and give their simian cousins the fright of their lives, sending them scurrying out of town. The human-into-monkey trick - reversing man's evolution - has developed from an earlier practice of patrolling Delhi's streets with real langurs that walked on leads with their trainers, particularly through the city's posh neighbourhoods. But then the Indian government passed a law preventing langurs from being keep in captivity - and back came the bandit macaques to take up the pilfering where they had left off. Soon the New Delhi Municipal Corporation became flooded with complaints and with professional monkey catchers and their langur side-kicks moving off 'we couldn't find people who knew the tactics to scare the monkeys,' said a corporation employee.

Step up: The human-into-monkey trick - reversing man's evolution - has developed from an earlier practice of patrolling Delhi's streets with real langurs that walked on leads with their trainers, particularly through the city's posh neighbourhood . Then came the idea of getting people to pose as langurs - and there was a ready team to do that. Pramod Kumar, a monkey impersonator, rustled up a number of his friends and soon there were 40 of them ready to paint their faces, stick some fur onto their arms and legs, and start screeching at the macaque invaders. 'I'll growl at them or chase them with a stick,' he says. Time will tell just how effective the monkey men are, but early results are said to be promising. A senior official at the council said the practice was the only available option since the ban on keeping trained langurs came into effect. 'These young men have trained themselves to pose as langurs,' he said. 'We have no option but to hire them because, as per law, even an officer who calls for a langur and its master to drive away monkeys can be booked and jailed,' he said.","Imitating the langur monkey in order to scare away their macaque cousins .

"Emmanuel Adebayor has backtracked after his extraordinary rant against Tottenham supporters to insist he merely meant the players 'respond better to praise than criticism'. The Tottenham striker attacked fans on Sunday for not making the team feel welcome at White Hart Lane during their Barclays Premier League defeat against Stoke. And the 30-year-old, with five goals in 22 games, has urged them to get behind the team because the negative atmosphere does not help.

'And I am not just talking about me, I am speaking on behalf of all the players. ‘I think it might be better to play away from home at the moment because at least we know beforehand we are guaranteed to be booed because they want their home club to win. ‘But when you are playing at home and your own fans start booing you after a few minutes then it is harder.' 'I just merely suggested that it would be more positive if they got behind the team more,' Adebayor tweeted on Tuesday evening. 'I love the club as do all the players in the dressing room. 'We would all do anything to make this team win but like most people we respond better to praise than criticism. 'We will get this right. Please bear with us and we will improve.'

"Nasa has spotted a mysterious methane cloud high in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan. They say the phenomenon is similar to exotic clouds found far above Earth's poles. This lofty cloud, imaged by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, was part of the winter cap of condensation over Titan's north pole. This cloud in the stratosphere over Titan's north pole  contains methane ice, which was not previously thought to form in that part of the atmosphere. Cassini first spotted the cloud in 2006. The newly identified cloud instead developed in the stratosphere, the layer above the troposphere. Earth has its own polar stratospheric clouds, which typically form above the North Pole and South Pole between 49,000 and 82,000 feet (15 to 25 kilometers) - well above cruising altitude for airplanes. These rare clouds don't form until the temperature drops to minus 108 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 78 degrees Celsius). Now, eight years after spotting this mysterious bit of atmospheric fluff, researchers have determined that it contains methane ice, which produces a much denser cloud than the ethane ice previously identified there. 'The idea that methane clouds could form this high on Titan is completely new,' said Carrie Anderson, a Cassini participating scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study. 'Nobody considered that possible before.' Methane clouds were already known to exist in Titan's troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Like rain and snow clouds on Earth, those clouds form through a cycle of evaporation and condensation, with vapor rising from the surface, encountering cooler and cooler temperatures and falling back down as precipitation. On Titan, however, the vapor at work is methane instead of water. The newly identified cloud instead developed in the stratosphere, the layer above the troposphere. Earth has its own polar stratospheric clouds, which typically form above the North Pole and South Pole between 49,000 and 82,000 feet (15 to 25 kilometers) - well above cruising altitude for airplanes. These rare clouds don't form until the temperature drops to minus 108 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 78 degrees Celsius). Other stratospheric clouds had been identified on Titan already, including a very thin, diffuse cloud of ethane, a chemical formed after methane breaks down. Delicate clouds made from cyanoacetylene and hydrogen cyanide, which form from reactions of methane byproducts with nitrogen molecules, also have been found there. But methane clouds were thought unlikely in Titan's stratosphere. Because the troposphere traps most of the moisture, stratospheric clouds require extreme cold. Even the stratosphere temperature of minus 333 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 203 degrees Celsius), observed by Cassini just south of the equator, was not frigid enough to allow the scant methane in this region of the atmosphere to condense into ice. Earth's polar stratospheric clouds, similar to the cloud in the stratosphere over Titan's north pole . What Anderson and her Goddard co-author, Robert Samuelson, found is that temperatures in Titan's lower stratosphere are not the same at all latitudes. Data from Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer and the spacecraft's radio science instrument showed that the high-altitude temperature near the north pole was much colder than that just south of the equator. It turns out that this temperature difference -- as much as 11 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 degrees Celsius) -- is more than enough to yield methane ice. Titan has a global circulation pattern in which warm air in the summer hemisphere wells up from the surface and enters the stratosphere, slowly making its way to the winter pole. There, the air mass sinks back down, cooling as it descends, which allows the stratospheric methane clouds to form. The mechanism for forming these high-altitude clouds appears to be different from what happens in the troposphere. Titan has a global circulation pattern in which warm air in the summer hemisphere wells up from the surface and enters the stratosphere, slowly making its way to the winter pole. There, the air mass sinks back down, cooling as it descends, which allows the stratospheric methane clouds to form. 'Cassini has been steadily gathering evidence of this global circulation pattern, and the identification of this new methane cloud is another strong indicator that the process works the way we think it does,' said Michael Flasar, Goddard scientist and principal investigator for Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). 'Titan continues to amaze with natural processes similar to those on the Earth, yet involving materials different from our familiar water,' said Scott Edgington, Cassini deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. 'As we approach southern winter solstice on Titan, we will further explore how these cloud formation processes might vary with season.'","Similar to exotic clouds found far above Earth's poles .

"Ed Miliband today described himself as a 'child of immigrants' but vowed to  introduce a new bill to tighten rules on foreigners moving to Britain if he wins the next election. The Labour leader, in Rochester and Strood ahead of next month's crunch by-election, said he was 'proud of the contribution' immigrants like his parents had made to Britain. But he pledged new legislation would be introduced in the first Queen's Speech after the general election. Extra border controls and new powers to force public sector workers to speak English will be introduced as part of a wider package of measures passed 'within weeks' of a new Labour government, party sources said. Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged immigration legislation in the first Queen's Speech after the general election as he campaigned in Rochester & Strood . Mr Miliband was campaigning before the November 20 Rochester and Strood by-election sparked by Conservative MP Mark Reckless defected to Ukip . A Conservative spokesman said: 'This is just pathetic posturing from Miliband...nothing he has promised today would actually reduce immigration. 'Labour had an open-door immigration policy for 13 years.' Mr Miliband praised Labour's candidate in Rochester, Naushabah Khan, adding: 'Like Naushabah, I am the child of immigrants'. But he said abuses needed to be tackled. He said recruitment agencies banned from only hiring from abroad and companies employing people from outside the EU would have to create an apprenticeship. There would also be a specific law against bringing in foreign workers to undercut wages in the UK, and a reintroduction of ‘counting in and counting out’ at borders. He has been under pressure from some of his MPs to harden his line on immigration since Ukip came close to taking Heywood and Middleton, a supposed safe Labour seat near Manchester in a by-election this month. But speaking to Labour supporters in Chatham, Mr Miliband said he was also clear about what he ‘will not do’. He said: ‘False promises on immigration just make people more cynical about politics. I will not be part of that.’ Mr Miliband said he knew the EU ‘needs to change if we are to deal with the problems of immigration’. ‘We will seek change in Europe for longer transitional controls when new countries join the EU,’ he said. Stopping child benefit and child tax credits being paid to kids living abroad. Doubling the period before people would be entitled to benefits. And stronger rules to deal with foreign criminals'. Ukip candidate Mark Reckless (left) hopes to follow in the footsteps of Douglas Carswell (right) who was became the party's first elected MP earlier this month . Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left), speaking with the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Strasbourg yesterday, has described the by-election as the 'most important' in 30 years . But he highlighted David Cameron's failure to hit the target of bringing net annual immigration down to tens of thousands. ‘I will not make promises I cannot keep,’ he said. ‘I will never propose a policy or a course of action that would damage our country. ‘Nigel Farage wants to leave the EU, on which three million British jobs and thousands of businesses in our country depend ... ‘Now David Cameron is also saying he is ready to leave the EU and have Britain turn its back on the rest of the world.’ Mr Miliband declared: ‘I will not be a prime minister that puts either those jobs and businesses or our national interest at risk. ‘Labour offers real change right now, not damage to our country.’ Voters in the Kent town of Rochester will get the chance to return Ukip's second MP in the by-election next year . The speech comes with less than a month to go until the by-election triggered by Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories to Ukip. A new poll has suggested Mr Reckless is on track to retain his seat on November 20, with 43 per cent support to 30 per cent for the Conservatives. Labour are trailing on 21 per cent. In a direct appeal to traditional Labour voters not to shift allegiance to Nigel Farage's Ukip, Mr Miliband said: ‘If you want a party for working people, then vote Labour in this by-election, for clear, credible and concrete change.’","Labour leader pledges legislation in first Queen's Speech after the election .

"Zaatari was only ever supposed to be a sparsely populated northern outpost on Jordan's border with Syria. But then in 2012 civil war broke out and the human tide began to flow across the border and the desert township became a city of of makeshift tents. The 3km refugee housing zone was designed to cater for 10,000 refugees, but in the space of two years, it's grown to 13 times its original size and now must house 130,000 refugees. Zaatari is now Jordan's fourth-largest city and the world's second-largest refugee camp. The United Nations is now calling the refugee crisis from the Syrian civil war one of the worst humanitarian crises in history. The flow of refugees across the border and into Zaatari shows no signs of slowing up. On some days, 4,000 people cross the border in search of a better life. But despite these odds, Andrew Harper, the chief of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Jordan, reckons his team on the ground have got the situation 'under control' and found a way to fit the desperate into the camp. They've started on another camp, Azraq, which will eventually house 100,000 refugees - who the UN expect to keep flowing across the border. 'I think we have generally got things under control,' he said confidently. 'But what we do need though is continued resources to keep making sure these people have got food, shelter, water and healthcare available.' Scroll down for video . With its neat alignment and rows of semi-permanent structures, this is the purpose built Azraq camp in the north of Jordan. Refugees are now being being taken here from the border and the overcrowded Zaatari camp . To raise the world's awareness of the scale of the problem they are facing, Mr Harper and UNHCHR photographer Jared Kohler have shot a series of imagines of life in Zaatari and the new Azraq camp. The images show the hardship of those who have endured the terrifying trip across from Syria and across the border, where they pray and hope to be picked up by UNHCR personnel and taken into camp as refugees. Mr Harper, a former Australian diplomat originally from Wagga Wagga in NSW, has plenty of experience to on the humanitarian front line. He's worked for the UN in Iraq, Iran and Turkey before taking control of Zaatari in 2012. Now he is helping to build Azraq, pictured above, which will be a semi-permanent place of residence already starting to cater for up to 100,000 refugees who will continue to arrive as long as the war in Syria continues. Mr Harper told Daily Mail Australia that he turned his back on a good career to return to Canberra to keep working on the relief effort. He would rather build a better life for these refugees than seek the safety of a job back in Australia. One of the biggest headaches he faces is predicting how many refugees will turn up at the border each day. 'Hundreds of thousands of people are crossing the border,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'At one point we were getting somewhere between 3,500 to 4,000 people fleeing Syria during the night.' Andrew Harper (third from left with sunglasses on his head) and soldiers on the ground in Jordan help a person cross the border from Syria into Jordan . Mr Harper said it's hard to translate these statistics into individual stories of hardship, but he says they are all seeking a better, safer, life. 'Everyone has a different story. Many of the children have lost their parents, their guardians, their families ... some children are asking when are we going to school, where are we going next.' The lucky ones have connections in Jordan - a country long regarded as an asylum for refugees. He said Jordan's people, many refugees themselves, are very 'welcoming and hospitable' and know what it is like to leave your family, possessions and comforts behind. 'Jordan is a fantastic country in terms of it's intake of refugees, ' he said. 'The Jordanians are a very hospitable country and there are plenty of descendants of refugees already living here.' While he said water, medicine and general living conditions at the Zaatari and Afraq refugee camps are at their most basic, the day-to-day struggles are usually far better than the bloodshed back home in Syria. Azraq is the better of the two camps, with its neat rows of purpose-built shelters that will eventually be able to cope with the overcrowded numbers of people populating the makeshift Zataari tents. It is, for now, the UNHCR's answer to the unfolding crisis and the overcrowding of new arrivals which he hopes ends with the end of conflict back in Syria. Syrian refugees with just the clothes on their back and some basic essentials make the journey through to Jordan where they are guarded by soldiers working on the ground .

A  shot across the makeshift Zaatari refugee camp where photographer Jared Kohler captured this photo with a flock of pigeons flying above at sunset . Zaatari camp by night shows the true size and scale of the region which is now overpopulated and at 13 times the capacity it was originally built to handle . Often, children become temporarily displaced from their parents because of the rush and large numbers of people crossing the border into Syria . UNHCR chief Andrew Harper is as much a part of the on-ground relief effort as the rest of his team . The biggest challenge facing the UNCHR, Mr Harper said, is that there is no estimating when the traffic of human crossings will stop . Many of the children that cross the border travel for days on an end wearing the same clothes, some flee from their Syrian houses in the dead of night wearing just their pyjamas and no shoes . Jordan has an incredibly welcoming hospitality and is known for its long-established history of accepting of refugees . UNCHR's top priority is to get refugees across the border, which at times, is a violent place where gun fire is  commonplace . Refugees battle the difficult terrain and dry desert region in Jordan's north . despite the hardship facing children at the refugee camps, these three still manage a smile for the camera as they play football in the desolate and isolated conditions . Newly arrived Syrian refugees wait at a desert processing center before they are transferred onward for registration and in most cases transfer to Arrival Processing Centre camps. Food is limited, but without the help of the UNHCR many of these young children would battle to survive . Man children are unaware of the situation back home, where as for others who have lost family members the realisation of fleeing is very real . These refugees are being taken to processing centres, where they will be then sent to Azraq Camp. Water is a finite resource in these overcrowded regions of Jordan, where every refugee pitches in to help each . The extremely hot and arid temperatures in Jordan's eastern desert makes conditions difficult for a swelling number of Syrian refugees . Syrian's visit a well in Azraq camp where they load up on essential supplies such as water . The UNHCR is a the world's largest humanitarian agency and has an  international staff of more than 8,600 people working across 126 countries.

The Nigerian girls never were rescued despite high profile displays of support for military intervention from the first lady and celebrities like Amy Poehler. Tweets trolling the White House with #bringbackourhumvee refer to a truck of American-made humvees ISIS reportedly confiscated last week in Iraq. ISIS happened upon the humvees as well as bulldozers, tanks, helicopters and weapons that were left behind by the Iraqi troops when they retreated from their posts as insurgents took the city of Mosul. The International Business Times reported last Thursday that the terrorist group had transported the humvees and other materials it had captured to Syria, where it is also at war with that country's government. Photos of the humvees being captured that were posted to twitter could not be verified but the pictures are consistent with reports coming out of the region.

Since then the president has sent the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier with its usual battleship escort, USS Mesa Verde, an amphibious transport ship that can carry 550 marines and helicopters, as well as 275 armed military personal into Bagdhad to protect State Department personnel and American assets as they are moved to safer locations. The U.S. has not engaged the opposition militarily, and the president is still mulling whether he wants to order air strikes on their strongholds. This afternoon the president sent in armed F-18 fighter jets to do surveillance. Meanwhile, the battle between the Iraqi army and ISIS blazed on as the terrorist group attacked the country's largest oil refinery on Tuesday night, setting it aflame.

'Without noting any favourable changes for three days, and after discussion with the player and Franck Le Gall, doctor of the France team, Didier Deschamps decided to release Laurent Koscielny to his club.' Arsenal do not expect Koscielny's injury to force him out of action and anticipate he will be fit for their next game, against Hull City, in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday week. Mesut Ozil has been ruled out for the remainder of 2014 with a knee ligament injury . Laurent Koscielny joins the Arsenal injury list which also includes... Mesut Ozil, Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy, Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry, Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and David Ospina . The centre half has returned from international duty as a precaution because France, as hosts of Euro 2016, are not involved in qualifying games.

"The 14-year-old boy who gunned down an innocent man on his way to see his children in between his two jobs has been identified as Kahton Anderson, a known member of Brooklyn's 'Stack Money Goons' gang whose intended target was a member of a rival gang that happened to be on the same bus as the victim, who sadly was killed in the crossfire. Anderson allegedly shot 39-year-old Angel Rojas, a father of two who supported his wife and kids by working two jobs, one at a bodega and another at a fruit stand. Rojas was on the B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn, where Anderson and two girls were sitting in the back row. Married father-of-two Angel Rojas, 39, was declared dead at a Brooklyn hospital after he was shot by a 14-year-old boy following a disagreement on a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus on Thursday evening . When the bus picked people up at . Lafayette Avenue and Marcus Garvey Boulevard, the two girls yelled 'he's . on the bus' as Anderson's intended target, a rival gangster from the . Twan Family gang, boarded the bus. Anderson . then emerged from the back of the bus with a 'weapon he could barely . control' and started shooting, according to the New York Daily News. Anderson . missed his target, but hit Rojas in the back of the head as he stood in . the front of the bus talking on his cell phone. After . missing his target - but fatally wounding Rojas - Anderson chased his . rival gangsters off the bus, firing four more shots from his massive . .357 Magnum pistol before running off and briefly hiding out in a . laundromat. 'Pretty big gun for a pretty small man,' a disgusted New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton told the News. 'The . stupidity of those gangs that . basically, over nothing, are trying to kill each other,' Bratton . continued to fume. 'Unfortunately, in the process, kill innocents as . they did with this . hardworking young man trying to raise his family.' The victim was shot in the head following a dispute involving several teenagers on a B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood on Thursday evening . Rojas, of East Flatbush, was rushed . to Woodhull Medical Center, where he died a short time later, the police . and emergency workers said. Originally from the Dominican . Republic, Rojas had moved to the U.S. about four years ago with his wife, . Maria Lopez, 41, their son, Saury, 12, and daughter, April, 8. In between his two jobs, Rojas would take the bus home in between . shifts to hug his children and get something to eat, according to his . family. 'That was very bad . of him,' son Saury said of his father's killer. 'He’s too small to be . with a gun. If he didn’t have that gun, my dad would be alive now.' The . family that once relied on Rojas' hard work is now left without a . provider, which has caused worry on top of the heartache for his . grieving wife. '[He was] the best man in the world . because his family always came first,' his wife, Maria Lopez, told DNAInfo. 'I . want [Anderson] to be punished even though he's not an adult, so he can . reflect and stop killing innocent people,' she continued. Rojas' children will remember him as a loving father who worked hard to make sure their needs were met. 'He took us to Coney Island,' his . son, Saury, told the website. 'We would go on rides every summer.' This . isn't the Anderson's first scrape with the law - he was arrested in . 2011 for assault, a police spokesman said. He was just 11 at the time of . that crime. Anderson will be charged with murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal use of a firearm, the NYPD said. He likely will be charged as an adult.","Angel Rojas, 39, was shot in the back of the head on a bus in Brooklyn on Thursday evening .

"A 69-year-old Minnesota man has been shot dead after opening his door to a man who claimed he was being chased. Kind-hearted: Thomas Sonnenberg was shot dead after opening his front door to 20-year-old Devon Parker . Thomas Sonnenberg called 911 at 11:46am Friday for 20-year-old Devon Derrick Parker who police say told him he was being pursued by assailants with baseball bats. When police arrived at the home on the 3700 block of North Aldrich Avenue in north Minneapolis, they found Sonnenberg dead. Parker was apprehended inside the house. Police spokesperson John Elder earlier indicated that Parker and Sonnenberg were acquaintances, but Sonnenberg's daughter Raina Baldwin says that was not the case. 'No. Absolutely not,' she told the Mail Online through tears. 'He thought he was helping someone in need, that's why he let him into the house,' she said. Baldwin said she believes Parker was attempting to rob the house but did not realize that her mother was also in the home. Sonnenberg answered the door to Parker begging to come in because he was in danger. He let the young man inside and closed the door before calling 911. It was then that Parker shot him in the head. Thomas Sonnenberg's wife Elaine Sonnenberg, 68, was in the kitchen at the time of the shooting. 'When the murderer found out she was here, he threw her around and choked her, and he was going to rape her,' Baldwin told Mail Online. The front door locked behind Parker when he entered the house. When Parker realized, he threatened Elaine Sonnenberg to force her to give him the keys, says Baldwin. Police, who Thomas Sonnenberg had called on Parker's behalf, arrived before he could escape. Sonnenberg 'seems like an innocent victim. From all indications, this . is not a bad guy, a drug deal gone wrong, or anything like that,' Elder . told the Star Tribune. Police recovered a handgun in the house which is believed to be the murder weapon, Elder said. Court records show that Parker was on probation for a felony assault in 2011. Records show he has been booked on numerous felony charges, including shooting at a public vehicle or facility and throwing bodily fluids or feces and has drug and trespassing convictions. Arrested: Devon Derrick Parker was on probation when he arrived at the door of Thomas Sonnenberg . Family home: Thomas Sonnenberg was shot dead inside the home on Aldrich St where he and his wife raised their three daughters . Long record: Parker's police record includes felony arrests for violence, drugs and trespassing . Sonnenberg has no police record. Baldwin says it was not the first time her father had opened his home to someone in need. 'He had a big heart,' she said. 'He had helped people before who had come to his door. He was not stupid, he thought he was helping this person.' Elder says there is no indication that Parker was being followed or threatened, and he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Thomas Sonnenberg and his wife have three grown-up daughters and several grandchildren. He was the second youngest of 10 kids who grew up on a vegetable farm in Brooklyn Center, Darrell Sonnenberg told the Star Tribune. 'He was a pretty good guy, pretty friendly, pretty nice,' Darrell Sonnenberg said. 'Not a tough guy. He took good care of his kids.' Another of Thomas Sonnenberg’s daughters, Rachel Sonnenberg Baufield, posted about her father's tragic death yesterday. 'My DAD was cruelly taken from me and my family today. Please pray for justice for him and wish him to be at peace! I loved him very much! The world will be a much sadder place without him in it.'","Thomas Sonnenberg, 69, was shot dead at home after opening his front door to Devon Derrick Parker .

"South Korean soldiers have arrested an . American man discovered swimming in a river leading to North Korea in the hope of meeting Kim Jong-un. Marines guarding the Han river, which flows into an estuary and meets the North's Imjin river, found the man lying on the bank suffering from exhaustion, local media reported. The unidentified man, who is believed to be in his late 20s or early 30s, later told South Korean authorities he had been trying to get to North Korea in the hope of meeting its leader, Kim Jong-un. Scroll down for video . Explanation: The unidentified man, believed to be in his late 20s or early 30s, told South Korean authorities he had been swimming towards North Korea in the hope of meeting the country's leader Kim Jong-un (pictured) North and South Korea are technically still at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce and not a peace treaty. The border between the two countries is one of the most heavily militarised in the world and unauthorised bids to cross it can spark clashes. South Korea's defence ministry could not immediately confirm . details of the report but an official said an American man was . picked up by the military late last night and was being . questioned. The U.S. embassy in Seoul said it had been in contact with . South Korean authorities about the report. 'We do not have any additional information to share at this . time. We have been in touch with the appropriate South Korean . authorities regarding the reports,' embassy spokeswoman Nida . Emmons said by email. No entry: The border between North and South Korea is one of the most heavily militarised in the world and unauthorised bids to cross it can spark clashes . The incident comes after a young American man who tore up his own tourist visa on landing in North Korea and demanded to be arrested so that he could experience prison life in the communist nation was sentenced to six years hard labor for entering the country illegally to commit espionage. Matthew Miller, 24, of Bakersfield, California, looked thin and pale at his trial in Pyongyang on Sunday, as he was handed out his sentence. Showing no emotion throughout the proceedings, Miller waived the right to a lawyer and was handcuffed before being led from the courtroom after his sentencing. Earlier, it had been believed that Miller had sought asylum when he entered North Korea. During the trial, however, the prosecution argued that was a ruse and that Miller also falsely claimed to have secret information about the U.S. military in South Korea on his iPad and iPod. Imprisoned: The incident comes just days after U.S. citizen Matthew Miller, 24, (pictured) was sentenced to six years hard labor in a military camp for entering North Korea illegally to commit espionage . Miller was charged under Article 64 of the North Korean criminal code, which is for espionage and can carry a sentence of five to 10 years, though harsher punishments can be given for more serious cases. He is one of three Americans now being held in North Korea. There have been no cases of Americans entering North Korea . from the South without legal authorisation in recent years.

"Fired: Crystal Moore, pictured, a 20-year veteran with the Latta Police Department, was relieved of her duties as chief of police on Tuesday . An openly gay chief of police has been fired by a South Carolina mayor who was caught saying he preferred alcoholics to homosexuals. Crystal Moore, a 20-year veteran with the Latta Police Department, was relieved of her duties as chief of police on Tuesday following seven reprimands handed down by newly elected Earl Bullard. The chief had recently discovered during an investigation that the town's parks and recreations director Vontray Sellers had operated a city vehicle with a suspended license. During the probe, Moore found that Bullard failed to conduct a proper background check on Sellers before giving him the job. On Tuesday, Bullard dismissed Moore, who is the Latta's first female chief of police and has not faced disciplinary action in her two decade career. Bullard claimed Moore conducted a background check without authorization, questioned the authority of a supervisor and contacted 'news media to help bring about disorder and disruption to the town of Latta,' among other things. But many in the community, including city officials, are questioning whether the real motive behind the firing was retaliation or the fact he allegedly doesn't like gay people. Council member, Jared Taylor, provided WBTW with a recording of a phone call in which the mayor makes several anti-gay remarks. Disagreement: The police chief was given seven reprimands in one day by newly elected Earl Bullard, pictured, who had previously been caught making anti-gay remarks . WBTW-TV: News, Weather, and Sports for Florence, SC . 'I would . much rather have - and I will say this to anybody's face - somebody who . drank and drank too much taking care of my child than I had somebody . whose lifestyle is questionable around children,' Bullard said on the . call. 'I'm . not going to let two women stand up there and hold hands and let my . child be aware of it, and I'm not going to see them do it with two men . neither.' Another council member, Lutherine Williams told the station of the new mayor: 'We have codes, but this mayor refuses to obey anything in that book he don't want to.' Williams added that proper protocol would required Bullard to give Moore a verbal warning, then a written warning. Packing up: The community were upset by the sudden firing of Moore, pictured right . Rally: Hundreds turned out at town hall to rally in support of the police chief . Instead, he gave her seven reprimands in one day. 'Before he was sworn in [as mayor], he said ... Crystal would not have a job,' Williams told WBTW. Moore said Thursday she now agrees the mayor had a vendetta against her and fired her because of her sexuality. 'I can't believe that we still have no equal rights. That's the biggest issue. I've been harassed, intimidated. This is the first time it's been this public. I'd tried living a quiet decent life and do what I'm supposed to,' she said. As well as council members, who have refused to acknowledge her termination, Latta residents were furious by the new mayor's move and showed their disapproval by protesting Moore's termination at City Hall. 'This woman has been a veteran of the department and a pillar of this community for years,' Kevin Drawhorn, a Latta resident and supporter of Moore, told WBTW. Another support rally was planned for the chief Thursday night. The city council, which says the mayor can only fire a police chief with their prior approval, held a special meeting on the dismissal Thursday night in which they voted for a referendum to weaken the mayor's power.","Crystal Moore, a 20-year veteran with the Latta Police Department in South Carolina, was relieved of her duties as chief of police on Tuesday .

"Uganda has been revealed as the most ethnically mixed country on the planet according to a new scientific study that blows apart misconceptions that western nations are the most racially diverse. Academics at Harvard University's Institute for Economic Research spent a painstaking 11 years studying 650 different ethnic groups across 190 countries. Using data from sources including . national censuses, Encyclopedia Brittanica, the CIA, Minority Rights . Group International and a 1998 study called 'Ethnic Groups Worldwide', . scientists gave each country. Using that data, they worked out an 'ethnicity rating' for each country based on the question: If you picked two people at random in any nation and asked them their ethnicity, what are the chances that they would give a different answer? And as this map shows, it has thrown up some rather unexpected results. Surprising? This map shows the planet's most and least ethnically diverse nations in the world. The countries in green are the most diverse, while those in red are the least . Uganda is home to more than 40 different indigenous ethnic groups, including the Baganda, Iteso, Basoga and Banyankore - all of which have their own languages, cultures and customs. While the East African nation tops the list, at the bottom came South Korea which was classed the world's most homogenous nation. But . perhaps what will prove most surprising to some, Europe is revealed as . the least ethnically diverse continent on the planet, with the UK and . France as two of the most. The revelation will stick with certain right-wing . political parties who claim that mass immigration has diluted indigenous culture and custom and left their societies with little or no tangible sense of national identity. At the other end of the scale, Africa is exposed as the world's most racially diverse continent. Indeed, the top 20 most diverse nations in the world are all in Africa. Top and bottom:  While Uganda, left, tops the list, at the bottom came South Korea, right, which was classed the world's most homogenous nation . Meanwhile, the US came almost exactly in the middle with Canada ranked more diverse than its southern neighbour. The study comes after the global social attitudes study . claimed that the most racially intolerant populations are all in the . developing world, with Bangladesh, Jordan and India in the top five. By contrast, the study of 80 countries over three decades found Western countries were most accepting of other cultures with Britain, the U.S., Canada and Australia more tolerant than anywhere else.","The map was developed after 11 years of painstaking research by academics at Harvard University .

"Police searching for missing teenager Alice Gross have seized more CCTV footage than they did during the aftermath of the London riots . Police hunting for missing schoolgirl Alice Gross have started searching the National Trust-owned estate where Batman was filmed - two miles from where she was last seen. Scotland Yard officers are combing Osterley Park, a Georgian country house and estate in west London, for the first time. The estate is around two miles from where the 14-year-old was last seen on CCTV cameras as she walked across Brentford Lock on the Grand Union Canal. The 16th century mansion was used as the residence for the fictional superhero in the Batman blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises, starring Christian Bale. It has been exactly a month since Alice failed to return home to her family, sparking the Metropolitan Police’s biggest search operation since the 7/7 bombings. More than 300 officers from over a dozen police forces across the country are involved in the increasingly desperate hunt, which has even called on the assistance of the RAF who helped to identify possible new search sites. And a stretch of the Grand Union Canal, which Alice walked alongside before she disappeared, was sifted through in the hope to recover her possessions, including her iPhone, but officers again drew a blank. Yellow ribbons adorn homes and railings in west London where the community have been praised by officers for their help in raising the profile of the missing teenager. On Sunday, hundreds of the ribbons were handed to runners at the Ealing Half Marathon in a bid to spread the word. Police searching for the missing teenager  have seized more CCTV footage than they did during the aftermath of the London riots, officers have confirmed.

It comes after a businessman whose cameras look out onto the area, said police missed the chance to view his CCTV footage because it is stored for only 13 days. David O’Neil, director of Contrast UK Shopfront Shutters, near where Alice was last seen, said it was a ‘cock-up’. A Met Police spokesman said officers did not request the footage as they felt they had everything they needed. He added: 'CCTV is a valuable part of any investigation.

'We do not seize all CCTV; we target that which is relevant and likely to be of value to the investigation.

The 16th century Osterley Park was used as the residence for the fictional superhero in the Batman blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises, starring Christian Bale and Michael Caine . Osterley Park is around two miles from where the 14-year-old was last seen on CCTV cameras as she walked across Brentford Lock on the Grand Union Canal, and near to the previous search area of Elthorne Park . Officers drained a stretch of a canal on Sunday in the hunt for Alice's missing possessions. Police spent hours sifting through mud and debris after receiving ‘specific intelligence’ that some of her belongings could be found there. They are desperate to recover the 14-year-old’s iPhone, which lost its signal an hour before she was due home. The move came as the sister of prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns, 41, said he could use his military training to live rough for weeks. The jobbing builder has not been seen since Alice’s disappearance grabbed headlines nationwide. Police searching along the Tow Path of the Grand Union canal in Hanwell on Monday as part of the search for Alice . Dozens of officers spent the weekend scouring the open land around where Alice was last seen alive, with RAF aircraft carrying high-definition cameras and thermal imaging equipment overhead. More than a month since Alice vanished police took the dramatic step of draining a 200-yard stretch of the Grand Union Canal, near her home in Hanwell, west London. They are desperately trying to find clues as to the fate of the schoolgirl and the location of the man suspected of playing a role in her disappearance. Prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns, 41, went missing days after Alice disappeared . Zalkalns, who lived in Ealing with his girlfriend and their baby daughter, went missing himself seven days later. He was captured on the same CCTV camera as Alice, cycling in the same direction. But his location remains a mystery – he does not have his passport and has not used his mobile phone or accessed his bank account. Zalkalns was jailed for seven years in Latvia after stabbing his 22-year-old wife Rudite in the heart and burying her body more than 17 years ago. The killer even managed to convince police and his wife’s family that she was missing when he had in fact lured her to her death. Zalkalns’ statement reveals he made a knife to kill his wife and hid it in a remote forest. ‘I took her to a place in the forest that I knew,’ he wrote. ‘I asked her to wait and went to get the metal bar and the knife. ‘I took the metal bar and beat her a few times on the head. ' She fell down on her back and I got the knife. 'Then I cut her clothes and then ... I stabbed her once in the heart.’ His sister, Jolanta Daksa, said Zalkalns – a former member of the Latvian home guard – is ‘more than capable of surviving outdoors for weeks’. She said he had been consumed by guilt after killing his wife and would have contacted his family to tell them he had not harmed Alice. ‘I think he has killed himself,’ she added. Police are still working through 150 tip-offs they received after staging a reconstruction of Alice’s disappearance last week and reviewing material from 300 CCTV cameras.","Officers searching Osterley Park, a National Trust country house and estate .

"England will break with tradition and present Wayne Rooney with the Golden Cap designed to commemorate his century of appearances before Saturday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia. David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard all received the honour ahead of the next Wembley international after they had completed their 100th game. Rooney will reach the milestone at Wembley on Saturday and will lead out the team with sons Kai and Klay. Wayne Rooney will receive a Golden Cap before England's match against Slovenia on Saturday . Ashley Cole was congratulated by England manager Roy Hodgson after his 100th cap . Rooney's two sons - including Kai (pictured) - will be at Wembley to see their dad receive his Golden Cap . Peter Shilton - 125 . David Beckham - 115 . Steven Gerrard - 114 . Bobby Moore - 108 . Ashley Cole - 107 . Sir Bobby Charlton - 106 . Frank Lampard - 106 . Billy Wright - 105 . If he were to follow the usual procedure he would receive his Golden Cap ahead of the qualifier against Lithuania in March but Sir Bobby Charlton  — one of eight other England centurions — will make the presentation before kick-off on Saturday. Roy Hodgson believes his captain still has his best years in an England shirt ahead of him as he blends experience with his natural talents. ‘I think he will become better,’ said Hodgson in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live. ‘He has had a turbulent career in many ways, bursting on to the scene as the wonderkid and being the saviour of English football. 'He has had to suffer the slings and arrows because of the times when of course he has not been able to be the saviour of English football and people have criticised him for it. Rooney was pictured with 99 schoolkids all wearing England shirts at his old primary school . ‘That has given him an incredible maturity and all the qualities he had at 19 he basically still possesses, but what he does have which he didn’t have at 19 or 24 or 25 is this incredible experience, this incredible belief and mental strength. ‘That is something we will need going forward, mental strength. That’s a harder thing to teach or to instil in the squad than tactics or technique.’ At 29, Rooney can target Peter Shilton’s record of 125 England caps, according to his vice captain Gary Cahill. ‘He’s fit, he looks after himself and trains really hard, so I can’t see why not,’ said Cahill. ‘I can’t see why he can’t break all the records, to be honest. ‘He’s a world-class player. We’ve seen that over many years. To be coming up to 100 caps at such a young age is phenomenal. He can go on for many, many more years. He’s a fantastic player.’","Wayne Rooney will make his 100th appearance for England on Saturday .

"FA Cup third-round Saturday, widely regarded as the most romantic day in the football calendar, is set to be ruined this season. The traditions of the oldest cup competition in the world have been under attack for years. But now a raft of the most attractive ties on January 3 will be switched to Sunday or even Monday to accommodate a full Barclays Premier League programme two days earlier on New Year’s Day. Arsene Wenger lifts the trophy after Arsenal's 3-2 win over Hull City in the FA Cup final in May . Arsenal faced Tottenham in last year's third-round highlight, played on the Saturday evening - Theo Walcott picked up a serious injury during the match and gestured to the Spurs fans as he was carried off . Discussions have already been held at the FA and competition organisers are prepared to be flexible on who plays and when. Much will hinge on how teams come out in the third-round draw, to be held next month, and which ties are selected for live television, but it could be that more than half the 32 matches will be moved back. All 20 teams in the top flight are in action on New Year’s Day, with Tottenham vs Chelsea kicking off late for TV at 5.30pm. Premier League managers, never slow to complain about fixture congestion, will not be happy at the prospect of playing twice in three days for the second time in little more than a week. And that seems certain to lead to many fielding weakened sides in the FA Cup. All 20 teams in the top flight are in action on New Year’s Day with Chelsea (above) at Spurs in the late game . The famous FA Cup third-round Saturday is set to be ruined by the Premier League calendar . They already face a full programme of fixtures on Boxing Day, followed by games on Sunday December 28 for everyone bar Liverpool and Swansea, who meet the next day. The problem does not exist for clubs in the Football League because there is no New Year’s Day programme for the Championship, League One or League Two. It will come down to which Premier League clubs request a change once the draw has been made and whether that can be agreed with the police and safety advisory groups. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert openly admitted last season the Premier League was his priority . Craig Robinson celebrates scoring Warrington's winning goal against Exeter City in the first round . Five games will be moved as usual for live television — three for BT Sport and two for the BBC — although the BBC’s Friday night slot will have to be relocated if they want a tie featuring a Premier League club. The FA Cup is enjoying a healthier profile this season, partly due to its return to the BBC. Attendances in the first round were up 11 per cent on last year. Two non-League sides, Bromley and Dartford, drew more than 4,000 fans. The Cup final is also back in its prestigious place as the last game of the domestic season on Saturday May 30.","The traditions of the FA Cup have been under attack for years .

"Defense attorneys are set to strongly suggest that the real killers of a toddler brutally shot to death in his stroller were his parents, who had a financial interest in his death - and that their 18-year-old defendant who goes on trial this week is not guilty. Antonio Santiago had learned to walk, but not yet talk, when he was killed March 21, six weeks after his first birthday. He was strapped in his stroller, out for a walk with his mother a few blocks from their apartment near the Georgia coast, when someone shot the boy between the eyes with a .22-caliber bullet the size of a garden pea. On trial for murder: De'Marquise Elkins, 17, appears in court on Monday over the death of a 13-month-old baby who was shot dead in Brunswick, Georgia . Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother . De'Marquise Elkin, 18, who has been . charged as the shooter, is scheduled to stand trial next week in a . courthouse far from the scene of the crime. Kevin . Gough, a public defender who is Elkins' lead attorney, has strongly . suggested in pretrial motions that the real killers are the child's own . parents. ‘Other . evidence of record suggests Sherry West is mentally unstable, gave . several inconsistent accounts of how the crime transpired, and had a . financial interest in the death of her son in the form of an insurance . policy,’ Gough said in a court motion filed August 5. Defense . attorneys have said in court filings they have audio recordings and . documents showing the child's mother had dealings with Gerber Life . Insurance Co. According . to its website, Gerber Life sells life insurance policies for children . starting as early as infancy. Coverage runs from $5,000 to $50,000. Ashley . Glassey, West's 21-year-old daughter, told television station WTLV of . Jacksonville, Florida, soon after the shooting that her mother called . her after Antonio was killed and asked, ‘How soon do you think the life . insurance policy will send me a check?’ One . of Elkins' lawyers interviewed Glassey July 30 in Woodstown, New . Jersey, where she was in jail for failing to appear in court in an . unrelated case. According to a transcript, Glassey declined to confirm the story, only saying that she does not want ‘to incriminate anyone.’ Because . of public outrage and news coverage, a judge has moved Elkins' trial 325 . miles away, to the suburbs outside Atlanta. Jury selection starts Monday . at the Cobb County courthouse in Marietta. Superior Court Judge Stephen . Kelley has set aside two weeks for the trial. Conspiracy: The defense has suggested that the baby's parents killed him to collect his life insurance . Incriminating: West's 21-year-old daughter told a TV . station that her mother called her after Antonio's murder wondering how . long it would take to receive a check from the life insurance company . Elkins . faces life in prison if convicted of murder. His youth spared him a . possible death sentence. At the time of the shooting he was 17, too . young to face capital charges in Georgia. Investigators . concluded that Antonio was killed during an attempted street robbery as . his mother, Sherry West, was strolling home with the child from the . post office. Miss West said a gunman demanding cash shot her baby in the face after she told him she had no money. ‘He . kept asking, and I just said “I don't have it,""’ West told The . Associated Press the day after the slaying. ‘And he said, “Do you want . me to kill your baby?” And I said, “No, don't kill my baby!”’ West . was shot in the leg, and another bullet grazed her ear. Witnesses . called 911 and rushed to her aid. None saw the shooting, but they . watched as West tried to revive her son using CPR. ‘No, the baby's not breathing,’ one caller told a 911 operator. Police said Elkins had an accomplice, 15-year-old Dominique Lang, who has told investigators Elkins fired the gun. Lang also is charged with murder but will be tried later. He's expected to be a key witness against Elkins. Spared: Because of his youth, Elkins will not be facing capital punishment, if convicted . Evidence: Lab tests found traces of gunshot residue on swabs taken from the hands of West (left) and the boy's father, Louis Santiago (right) The 15-year-old was in the eighth grade at Glynn Middle School before his arrest, said Jim Weidhaas, a school spokesman. Elkins was last a student in the . system in October 2011 when he left Ombudsman, an outsourced alternative . school program, Weidhaas said. Both . prosecutors and Elkins' defense attorneys declined to comment before . the trial, citing a gag order by the judge. The boy's mother also . declined to talk. In 2008, West's 18-year-old son was . stabbed to death in an altercation in New Jersey. Prosecutors said the . stabbing was self-defense and did not file charges. History of violence: Prosecutors said Elkins shot somebody else 10 days before the toddler was killed . Family: Elkins' mother and sister provided information that led police to a pond where they found a .22 caliber revolver . Defense . attorneys also pointed to lab tests by the Georgia Bureau of . Investigation that found traces of gunshot residue on swabs taken from . the hands of West and the boy's father, Louis Santiago. Reports . filed in court stated the GBI found a single microscopic particle of . gunshot residue swabbed from the father's hands, while more than five . particles showed up in swabs from West's hands. The . GBI report cautioned that gunshot victims can end up with residue on . them. During a preliminary court hearing, Santiago said he touched the . bullet wound on West's leg before his hands were swabbed. In . a court filing Wednesday, District Attorney Jackie Johnson argued that . Elkins' defense lawyers have made ‘false, inflammatory and misleading . statements’ about the case. While . the toddler's mother identified Elkins as the shooter in a photo . lineup, police said much of their evidence against the teenager came . from his own family and the younger teen charged as his accomplice. Grief: Antonio's father Luis Santiago tries to comfort Ms West at her apartment on Friday . Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money . Investigators . have testified that Lang told police he and Elkins were trying to rob a . woman pushing a baby in a stroller when Elkins pulled a gun and shot . them both. Lang's aunt, . Debra Obey, told police her nephew and Elkins came to her for a ride . the day of the slaying. She said Elkins ducked down in the back seat of . her car, as if he was hiding. Four . days after the shooting, police said information from Elkins' mother . and sister helped lead investigators to a pond where they found a . .22-caliber revolver. Both . women were charged with evidence tampering. Elkins' mother, Karimah . Elkins, also was charged with lying to police. Prosecutors say Elkins' mother and an aunt gave police conflicting alibis for his whereabouts at . the time of the shooting. Karimah Elkins is scheduled to stand trial . alongside her son. Tragedy: Little Antonio Santiago's stroller stands empty after the 13-month-old was shot in the head during a botched robbery . Tearful: West is devastated that she will never see her son grow up - or even learn to speak her name . Meanwhile, prosecutors said Elkins shot somebody else 10 days before the toddler was killed. Wilfredo . Calix Flores has identified Elkins as the man who shot him in the arm . during an attempted stickup March 11. Police said Flores was shot with a . .22-caliber bullet. The judge has ruled that jurors can hear about a statement police say Elkins made the day after the killing. Police . investigator Roderic Nohilly testified at a pretrial hearing that he . and officer Cody Blades were escorting a handcuffed Elkins when the . suspect said, ‘Y'all ain't got no gun. Y'all ain't got no fingerprints.’ He then referenced an acquittal. The investigator said Blades just smiled at Elkins, who responded: ‘Oh, y'all got the gun?’ Scene of the shooting: Antonio's upturned stroller still lies on its side in the residential area of Brunswick .","De'Marquise Elkins, 18, and Dominique Lang, 15, accused of shooting the son of Sherry West in the head .

"On Monday, 13-year-old Cartrail Robertson posted a picture of himself brandishing a 3.57 Magnum handgun onto Facebook - hours later he was accidentally shot dead by his 15-year-old friend. Indeed, the baby-faced Memphis teenager uploaded a veritable gallery of disturbing gangster-style excess to Facebook that shows him holding another handgun, reclining in a chair smoking pot and fanning a huge wad of $100 and $50 bills. His friends too have posted shocking images - in many of the pictures they appear to be waving semi-automatic weapons and in one staggering picture two teens are messing around with a handgun, pointing it towards a boys head. And while police have declared the investigation into Robertson's tragic death at the hands of Darrin Wilson, 'closed', their focus has shifted to discovering how two children managed to get hold of drugs, that much money and ultimately, the weapons. Shocking: Cartrail Robertson, 13, holding a .357 Magnum (left) and another unidentified handgun (right) in pictures posted to Facebook just hours before he died on Tuesday . Teenager: This picture of Cartrail Robertson shows him making an obscene gesture with his right hand and apparently smoking cannabis . Money: This huge wad of cash is accompanied by a post by Cartrail Robertson that seems to claim it is for buying a new handgun . 'There is an ongoing investigation in regards to how they obtained the guns,' Vince Higgins of the Shelby County District Attorney General Office, told ABC News. Robertson was found dead at around 3am on Tuesday morning and police have determined that he and Wilson were playing with a gun - presumably one of the two posted to Facebook - when it accidentally went off. Wilson has been taken to juvenile detention and is charged with reckless homicide. However, in the wake of Robertson's death, his Facebook profile reveals he and others in deeply unsettling images of teens posing with guns, apparent drugs paraphernalia and large sums of money. Outrageous: This image posted onto one of Cartrail Robertson's friends Facebook pages shows two boys clowning around with a handgun on a porch - it is not known if Robertson or his friend know the two people in this image . Guns and money: Some of the images contain boastful images of shotguns and money (left) while others show older teens with what appear to be AK-47s . Robertson, Wilson and his friends are also seen giving what appear to be gang hand signals and in other pictures they are showing off bottles of alcohol. In the Facebook picture that shows the pile of money, Robertson comments that it is (sic) 'time tah get mehh another 45th' with the hashtag of 'shooter' - an apparent reference to a .45 caliber handgun. And in another image showing Robertson smoking, the 13-year-old mentions drugs and tags his friend Darrin Wilson saying, (sic) 'blowin wit that hotboy'. On January 1st, Robertson uploaded a picture of himself in which he is seen holding a bottle of alcohol in which he boasts, (sic) 'am gettin money on hoezz y u smokein ya life away.' His prophetic prediction for 2014 is, (sic) 'In am lettin bulletts spkky.....Murder!!!' In other pictures uploaded by friends of Robertson tagged in his last Facebook post, the gallery of jaw-dropping pictures continues. While the images do not appear to feature Robertson, Wilson or his friend exclusively, their shocking content is undeniable. In many of the pictures the boys featured are brandishing handguns and have photographed shotguns and cash. One particularly upsetting image shows one boy pointing a gun at another's head as they apparently clown around on a front porch. Friends: Cartrail Robertson (left) is seen . holding alcohol and was shot dead by his friend Darrin Wilson, 15, . (right - also holding alcohol) on Tuesday . Huge sums: A boy, believed to be Cartrail . Robertson (left) is holding and counting money while (right) Robertson . is seen exhaling what appears to be pot . Shooting: This is the home in Memphis where Robertson was shot by Darrin Wilson according to police . In another image - what appear to be three boys older than Robertson and Wilson are seen counting cash while holding an assault rifle that resembles an AK-47. Shelby County District Attorney General Office said police are going through the photos on Robertson's Facebook page, as well as his friends' Facebook pages. Robertson was shot at the home of a friend while their mother and her boyfriend were at work. The boyfriend, who owns the Memphis home told police that he does not own a gun and that he is baffled as to where it came from. Before the Facebook posts became apparent, neighbors and police assumed that the gun was obtained inside the home on the 600 block of Hillcrest Street. Neighbors were alarmed when they learned the age of the shooting victim. 'Thirteen. Still a baby,' said Walter Holston.","Police shocked by gallery of guns on Facebook page of Memphis teen who was accidentally shot dead by his friend .

"His day in court: Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson testified at a grand jury investigating his shooting of an unarmed teenager . The Missouri police officer who caused a national furor when he shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown has testified in front of a grand jury investigating whether he should face criminal charges. Darren Wilson, who shot 18-year-old Brown six times in Ferguson, Missouri, emerged from hiding on Wednesday to appear in front of a St. Louis County grand jury. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Wilson was 'cooperative,' he though he was not legally obligated to appear in front of the panel. Prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch convened the grand jury to determine whether there is enough evidence to charge Wilson with a crime for killing Brown. McCulloch on Wednesday announced that if the grand jury finds no cause to file charges against Wilson, he will order the immediate release of audio recordings and transcripts of the proceedings. Grand juries normally conduct their business in secret to protect sensitive investigative details. However, the case has garnered so much attention that McColloch wants to allow the public to see all the details. 'We just want to be more open,' a spokesman said. Wilson has told investigators he he opened fire after Brown assaulted him and tried to grab his gun. He said he believed he was justified in using deadly force. However, Brown's friend, who was with him moment before the shooting, says Brown had his hands up and was surrendering when Wilson shot him dead in the street. The shooting infuriated residents in predominately black Ferguson took to the streets in protest. The heavy-handed response by the overwhelmingly white Ferguson Police Department kicked off a national conversation about race and the use of police force. Scroll down for video . Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times by Officer Wilson in the middle of a Ferguson, Missouri, street. His death prompted outrage in the community and resulted in several investigations . Reports that Brown was gunned down while he was surrendering with his hands in the air led to massive protests in Ferguson - with many activists shouting 'hands up, don't shoot' When Wilson's name was released publicly, he and his family fled their home and went into hiding, fearing reprisal from violent activists. McCulloch announced a grand jury would investigate the shooting and determine whether or not Wilson was within the bounds of the law when he opened fire. However, many black community activists have said McCulloch's judgement is already biased. His father, a police officer, was killed by a black suspect in the 1960s. The federal Justice Department has launched its own investigation of the shooting - as well as an investigation of the department's history of race relations.",Prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch announced he will release all details of the grand jury investigation if no charges are filed .

"Sam Tomkins says it will be payback time when England face New Zealand in Dunedin on Saturday for a place in the Four Nations Series final. The clash at the futuristic Forsyth Barr Stadium will be the first meeting of the teams since Shaun Johnson's converted try 20 seconds from the end of last November's World Cup semi-final at Wembley cruelly denied England a place in the final. James Graham has gone on record to say the effects of that heart-breaking finish 'will probably stay with me until the day I die' but Tomkins reckons victory on Saturday would go some way towards erasing the bitter memory. Shaun Johnson scored the winning try for New Zealand to break England hearts at Wembley last November . 'I know that all the players involved were hurting after that game, as you can imagine,' Tomkins said. 'We certainly feel like we owe them one for that, with Shaun Johnson getting one over us in the last minute.' Tomkins became a team-mate of Johnson's after the World Cup and has witnessed the creative skills of the talented half-back close up during his maiden season in the NRL. The England full-back will be up against another three of his New Zealand Warriors club-mates in Manu Vatuvei, Thomas Leuluai and Simon Mannering and has been able to offer coach Steve McNamara and the squad an insight into their strengths and weaknesses. 'I was getting asked a few questions - 'what does this bloke do?' and things like that,' Tomkins said. Sam Burgess (right) and his England team-mates look dejected at the final whistle . 'I've offered a couple of little bits to the coaches on how certain players play but nothing you can't see by watching the video of how they played against Australia and Samoa. The Warriors lads that are playing are all world class. 'The Kiwis are a very good side, as we all know, and we are going to have to do a great job to go out and beat them. We are going to give it our best.' The Four Nations Series has reunited Tomkins with seven of his old Wigan team-mates, including older brother Joel, who returned to the 13-man code in the summer after a three-year flirtation with rugby union. 'It's good to have some familiar faces around and it's good especially with the amount of young lads in this group,' said Sam. 'They have added a bit of energy to the group, so it's a good place to be. Sam Tomkins says it's payback time when England face New Zealand on Saturday . 'I have certainly missed playing alongside Joel. It's been a few years now but I think he is enjoying being back in league. It's where he belongs - he is a league player really.' Joel was a surprise addition to McNamara's 24-man squad after playing just seven games for his club but has started both Four Nations matches so far and is set to win his sixth cap on Saturday. He is delighted to be back in league but modestly plays down comparisons with other cross-code returnees. 'Guys like Sonny Bill Williams and Brad Thorn are at a different level to me,' he said. 'I'm just a bloke trying to do his best and not a superstar like them. 'It was an amazing experience in rugby union. Opportunities like that don't come around very often and to play at Twickenham against those teams was special. Joel Tomkins celebrates his try against Samoa in Brisbane last week . 'I really enjoyed it but I was approached to return to league and the timing was perfect. 'I feel I am a better league player than union player. That is the bottom line.' Joel, who was in the team alongside Sam that lost to New Zealand in Wellington four years ago, is confident the England pack can lay a foundation for the 10-point victory that would secure a return trip to the Westpac Stadium on Saturday week. 'We've got a bit of experience playing the Kiwis so we'll go into the Test with some confidence and hopefully get the job done,' he said. 'They've probably been the best pack around for the past few years so hopefully we can lay down a marker and go toe to toe with them. 'We have to win by 10 or more, which does add a little pressure, but we'll be trying not to think about that too much. If we put on a good performance, the points will come.'","Dunedin clash will be first meeting between sides since World Cup semi .

"This is one golf buggy that doesn't amble around a scenic  course. Named Bandit, this unusual machine has just set the fasted speed registered for a golf cart, receiving a Guinness World Record title. The landmark was set at Darlington Dragway, South Carolina, US on October 4, with the golf buggy creator Robby Steen reaching a top speed of 118.76mph. Robby Steen broke his own speed record for racing in a golf buggy . The golf cart zoomed through the first quarter mile in just 12.24 seconds . Robby forms a family team, called Plum Quick Motors, with father Carson and brother Ricky, and the group built the cart over six months in their spare time. The previous world record was held by - you got it, Robby with 103.65mph, as it zoomed through a quarter mile in 12.24 seconds. Speaking to Mail Online, Robby said: 'We’ve been drag racing electric golf carts since 2008. We were very confident that we could go well over the 103.65mph that we set the first Guinness World Record 'fastest golf cart'. 'We are very excited to have achieved a speed record like this and to do it with electric is even more exciting. 'I know without a doubt we can and will go much faster in the future.' The record was set at the famous Darlington Dragway in South Carolina, US . Robby forms part of a the Plum Quick Racing team with father Carson and brother Ricky . The Plum Quick Racing website states that the team 'produce high performance golf cart motors for a wide range of applications including hunting, off road, golfing, cruising and even racing.'

"Yorkshireman George Burgess reckons Steve McNamara's men should feel right at home in Dunedin as it reminds him of the north of England. England have set up camp in the south island of New Zealand, having flown from Melbourne to complete their attempts to reach a first Four Nations Series final Down Under. After beating Samoa and losing to Australia, England meet the Kiwis at the Forsyth Barr Stadium on Saturday needing to win by 10 points to guarantee themselves a trip to Wellington for the decider a week later. England's George Burgess pushes through the tackle of Australia's Cameron Smith during the Four Nations . The England players were greeted on their arrival in New Zealand at the start of the week by rain and a temperature drop of around 20 degrees compared to Queensland's Gold Coast, where they spent the first two weeks of their trip, but former Bradford forward Burgess says he is already feeling comfortable in the new surroundings. 'It's been good,' the 22-year-old Dewsbury-born Burgess said. 'This is a different environment and it's good being around old friends. 'And Dunedin looks a bit like the north of England, where I'm from, so I'm enjoying it.' Saturday's round-robin match would have been a dress rehearsal for the final but for Ryan Hall's disallowed try in the last minute of England's heartbreaking 16-12 defeat by the Kangaroos in Melbourne on Sunday but Burgess insists they have moved on from that disappointment. The England team on their arrival in Dunedin, where they are based ahead of their clash with New Zealand . George Burgess says he feels right at home in the South Island city, saying it's just like Yorkshire . 'It could just as easily been awarded a try but that's the game,' Burgess said. 'You win and lose games on the bounce of a ball and sometimes one decision can win or lose a game. 'You've just got to roll with it. Every team goes through it and we have to move on.' Burgess was also in the side pipped by New Zealand in last November's gut-wrenching World Cup semi-final defeat and spoke on Wednesday about the prospect of revenge. 'We have to win the game on Saturday, that is our focus,' he added. 'But it won't change our approach to the game. England take on New Zealand, who are in the box seat to confirm a place in the Four Nations final .

"Barcelona are looking to recapture the kind of form they hit under Pep Guardiola, when they dominated Europe, Andres Iniesta said on Friday. The Catalan club are in the process of rebuilding after they failed to win major silverware last season for the first time in six years and coach Gerard Martino has been replaced by Luis Enrique. Players including Uruguay forward Luis Suarez and Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic have arrived to join the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar and Iniesta said the players were excited about the new season starting next month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Iniesta say Suarez ban is harsh and see him lead training . Good call: Iniesta has been named as Barcelona's club captain following the departure of Carles Puyol . New era: Barcelona manager Luis Enrique (centre) takes training on Friday . 'We want to get back to doing things well and making the fans happy,' the Spain playmaker and club captain told a news conference. 'This year will be tough but we have the goal and the ambition to repeat (the successes of) the 2008-09 season,' he added. 'We are tackling this year just like that one, with a lot of excitement.' Iniesta said there were 'some similarities' with Barca’s situation now and in 2008 when Guardiola took over from Frank Rijkaard before going on to win 14 of the 19 competitions he contested during four seasons in charge, including two Champions League crowns and three La Liga titles. 'We are starting from scratch,' Iniesta said. Unprecedented: Guardiola is hoisted aloft by the Barcelona squad after winning the Champions League in 2009 . 'There have been a lot of changes but the level of excitement and desire is extremely high. 'The goals are the same as every season: win titles and start off on a good note to help us tackle the whole year.' Iniesta declined to offer a opinion on the ban Suarez earned for biting an opponent at the World Cup which will prevent him making his Barca debut until the end of October. Barca lured the 27-year-old, who was banned twice previously for biting, from English Premier League club Liverpool this month for a reported fee of around £75million. Nonplussed: Iniesta refused to comment on Luis Suarez's four-month ban from football . 'He is one of the best forwards in the world,' Iniesta said. 'For the players who make passes having a player with those characteristics is fundamental. He is a great signing for now and for the future.'

"A football player for the University of Kentucky has pleaded not guilty to first-degree rape. Defensive lineman Lloyd Tubman pleaded not guilty Wednesday and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing later this month. Tubman was arrested Tuesday for the Oct. 2 incident involving his alleged ex-girlfriend in a campus dormitory. His preliminary hearing will be Oct. 23. First-degree rape is a felony in Kentucky and Tubman faces up 20 years in prison. Charged: University of Kentucky football player Lloyd Tubman was charged with first-degree rape . Alleged rape: The university has said that Tubman was arrested by campus police following an incident last week at a residence hall on campus . As Tubman appeared on video from Lexington-Fayette Jail, located several miles from Fayette District Court, Lexington attorney Jim Lowry, who has handled numerous cases involving Kentucky athletes, entered his plea. Dressed in a standard-issue prison jumpsuit, Tubman said little and frequently hung his head during the brief proceeding. The Louisville native was released to his mother's custody after Judge Julie Goodman allowed 10% of his $10,000 bond, or $1,000 to be paid. He was ordered to have no contact with the woman. Lowry and family members declined comment as they left the courthouse. However, The Courier-Journal reported Tubman's mother Warnetta Smith Cooper wrote on Facebook 'Please don't pass judgment without the facts. My son (would) never hurt a female fly. Lloyd is not perfect but he's a good young gentleman.' Tubman, who hasn't played this season, has been suspended indefinitely by coach Mark Stoops. The university said in a release that the 6-foot-5, 225-pound Tubman is also subject to discipline under its code of conduct. According to the arrest warrant obtained by The AP, the woman called campus police Thursday following the incident involving Tubman, who she described as her ex-boyfriend. The AP does not identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault. Tubman called the woman around midday Thursday and asked to talk with her in her room. She initially refused, but signed him in as a guest after he told her he was in the lobby, the warrant said. Tubman has not played this season and was likely to be redshirted . Multiple incidents: Tubman's arrest and suspension comes less than a week after four Wildcats players were charged with second degree disorderly conduct for their involvement in air pistol shots being fired near a campus residence hall . The warrant states that the woman began typing a paper on a bed opposite Tubman, who kept knocking a shoe off her foot with a water bottle. When she went to pick it up, Tubman pressed against her from behind. The woman told Tubman they weren't going to have sex and returned to a roommate's bed. She later looked up to find Tubman naked. As she picked up his clothes and repeated that they weren't going to have sex, Tubman threw her on her bed and tried to undress her, the warrant said. After resisting and threatening to scream if he didn't stop, Tubman tried to cover the woman's mouth with his hand and she bit him between the thumb and index finger. Tubman responded by biting her on the right shoulder blade, leaving a mark, the warrant said. Tubman then forced the woman face-down on her bed and the rape occurred, the warrant said. She freed herself and ran to a closet but Tubman said he wasn't done; scared, she ran to the other side of the room, and fell, the warrant stated. The warrant states that Tubman laughed, and then said, 'I'm done playin wit you.' The woman told Tubman she had a class as an excuse to get him to leave. She signed Tubman out and security cameras show no interaction between the two, the warrant said. The woman then called campus police, who collected physical evidence including clothing and towels. The woman was treated at UK Hospital's emergency room. Coach Mark Stoops appeared shaken when discussing the situation after Tuesday's practice, saying, 'Anytime somebody in our program has an issue like this, it's obviously a major concern. We just feel for all parties involved and we'll let the legal process go through its course.' The 19-year-old football player formerly played for Louisville Seneca High School. Stoops learned about the incident last Thursday and said 'It was a tough time as you could imagine. ... I'm not so much concerned for myself in that situation. But really, it was very difficult to meet with Lloyd and meet with his mother and to see somebody in your program hurting. I feel for all parties. 'It's obviously not a situation that anybody wants to be in.' Stoops also said Tuesday 'We constantly talk to [the football team] about things,' according to The Courier-Journal. 'Last week when we had the other issue, I addressed all issues, including this -- including sexual assault and any kind of assault and all those things. I addressed it at that time again. And we'll continue to do the best we can and educate these guys and help these guys and, again, coach them and teach them and mentor them, and we'll be there for them when they need us to.' On Monday, MailOnline reported that a quarterback for the University of Florida was suspended from the Florida Gators because of a sexual assault allegation.","University of Kentucky freshman defensive lineman Lloyd Tubman pleaded not guilty to first-degree rape Wednesday .

"At school, most of us learnt that the  Earth’s tectonic plates ‘float’ like large rocky rafts. But teachers were vague about what the pieces of Earth’s crust actually  float on because no one really knew.Now scientists have solved the mystery, however. Geologists have used tonnes of dynamite, creating their own seismic waves, to discover that the plates move across a thick layer of jelly-like rock. Geologists have used tonnes of dynamite to create their own seismic waves and discover that tectonic plates move across a thick layer of jelly-like rock. Here, instruments are used to measure the waves . Together with experts from the US and Japan, a team of geologists from Victoria University of Wellington, in New Zealand, developed a new method to get the most detailed images yet of the base of the tectonic plate beneath Wellington. In the past, geologists have studied earthquakes and the speed of the seismic waves produced, in a bid to unravel the mystery. ‘Rather than relying on earthquake waves that come from below we create our own ""earthquakes"" with dynamite shots,’ study leader Tim Stern told Cosmos Magazine. The team detonated dynamite underground across the southern part of the North Island and listened for echoes to build an image of the bottom of the Pacific Plate, which is 62 miles (100km) beneath the Earth’s surface. They used 877 Coke can-sized seismometers set up over 52 miles (85km) to take their measurements. Experts already knew that plates are made of a thick layer of hard rock, called the lithosphere, above a softer layer called the asthenosphere (shown in this diagram), but the boundary between them was a mystery . In the past, geologists have studied earthquakes and the speed of the seismic waves produced, in a bid to unravel the mystery. This stock image shows seismic waves created by a small earthquake . Experts already knew that plates are made of a thick layer of hard rock, called the lithosphere, above a softer layer called the asthenosphere, but the boundary was a mystery. The recordings were clearer than before and showed that Earth’s tectonic plates are gliding on a distinct layer of ‘soft’ rock, six miles (10km) thick and weak enough to allow the plates to shift many centimetres per year. The study revealed that the Earth’s tectonic plates are gliding on a distinct layer of ‘soft’ rock, six miles (10km) thick. It is weak enough to allow the plates to shift many centimetres per year. The thinner layer beneath the plate appears to contain pockets of molten rock that make it easier for the plates to slide across them. This means that the plates can be pushed and pulled around without strong resistance at the base. Professor Stern said: ‘A weak slippery base also explains why tectonic plates can sometimes abruptly change the direction in which they’re slipping. It’s a bit like a ski sliding on snow.’ The rock may be soft  because of a higher concentration of water or magma than in rock in the lithosphere, which is 0.1 per cent magma. The experts say that if the rock was made of just 2 per cent magma, it may explain its unusual consistency. ‘The idea that Earth’s surface consists of a mosaic of moving plates is a well-established scientific paradigm, but it had never been clear about what actually moves the plates around,’ said Professor Stern of the university’s geography department. ‘To work this out requires an understanding of what happens at the bottom of a tectonic plate. It’s been difficult to obtain the necessary detailed images at such great depths using the usual method of recording natural earthquake waves. ‘But by generating our own seismic waves using higher frequency dynamite shots we were able to see how they became modified as they passed through different layers in the earth. ‘This, along with some new techniques in seismic reflection processing, allowed us to obtain the most detailed image yet of an oceanic tectonic plate.’ He says that the thinner layer beneath the plate appears to contain pockets of molten rock that make it easier for the plates to slide across them. ‘This means that the plates can be pushed and pulled around without strong resistance at the base. ‘A weak slippery base also explains why tectonic plates can sometimes abruptly change the direction in which they’re slipping.

The experts say that if the rock was made of just 2 per cent magma, it may explain its unusual consistency. ‘On a million-year time scale this would appear weak and jelly-like,’ Professor Stern said. He said that understanding the boundary between the base of cold, rigid tectonic plates and the underlying hot mantle underneath is central to our knowledge of plate tectonics, as well as the very formation and evolution of our planet. Researchers say weak zones caused the Earth's mantle to crack, causing tectonic plates to form . They are responsible for the formation of continents, and are still active - as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions show. However, researchers have never been able to work out why the Earth developed tectonic plates, but other planets did not. On April, Yale said it had solved the mystery - and say the key is tiny minerals within rocks. The research suggests how and when Earth came to develop one of its most distinct features — rigid tectonic plates — and why Venus, Earth’s twin-like neighbor, never has. 'We think it all comes down to the behavior of tiny grains of minerals within rocks,' said Yale geophysicist David Bercovici, lead author of research published online April 6 in the journal Nature. The researchers argue that in Earth’s early days, mantle convection caused weak zones in the lithosphere - the outermost shell of the planet. These zones persisted, developed into plate boundaries, and ultimately connected to form a global network of tectonic plates. The weak zones, they argue, resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms.","Geologists used dynamite to create their own seismic waves .

"Mike Ashley's capture of a Rangers powerbase will spark a fresh wave of upheaval at the beleaguered club. The Sports Direct billionaire secured virtual control of Ibrox affairs on Saturday after his offer of a £2million upfront loan was accepted by the board to stave off imminent financial peril. Ashley’s plan, which it was claimed includes the option of a new share issue, beat off opposition offers of aid from Dave King and Brian Kennedy and was driven through by an alliance of Sandy Easdale and Laxey Partners. Mike Ashley has strengthened his grip on the Rangers boardroom after his £2million offer . Now Ashley can flex his muscles and Graham Wallace, currently on holiday in Greece with his family, will be announced as the first major victim of that show of strength on Monday when he leaves the chief executive role he has filled since November last year. Former Newcastle United managing director Derek Llambias is in pole position for a top post within Ashley’s reshuffle and, on Saturday night, the name of Ashley’s business associate Stephen Mucklow was also credited with being in the frame for a place in a new-look boardroom. Ashley has had his sights trained on Wallace since early September in the wake of the announcement that £3.1m had been raised from a share issue as Wallace and finance director Philip Nash blocked his attempts to use assets — including the club crest and the Rangers trademark — as security during talks over a loan in the region of £10m. In removing both financial executives, who were open to the King/George Letham investment plan, Ashley can use the acceptance of his funding offer as the lever to cement control over the Rangers brand and plant his own men at the controls. Although Wallace had no intention of resigning, his colleague Nash walked out on Friday, with King musing that the former Liverpool and Arsenal financial executive had quit ‘as a matter of principle against something that is going on’. Nash departed because he felt the Rangers vote on which offer to accept was going to go against his financial logic. It’s understood that Nash could have stayed on by reverting to his previous role as financial director without a seat on the board. However, he felt that further Ashley involvement was not going to be healthy for the club. The £16m King bailout was killed off after key shareholder Sandy Easdale rejected the package in company with Ashley and Laxey. And Sale Sharks owner Kennedy’s late intervention to oppose Ashley with an alternative loan option also failed. Easdale holds proxy over 26 per cent, including the mysterious Blue Pitch and Margarita Holdings, and refused to back King’s proposal. Throw in Ashley’s 8.9 per cent and largest shareholder Laxey’s 16.3 per cent and that cabal enjoys 51-per-cent control. Ashley’s Sports Direct stores also have hold over Rangers retail. It was claimed in quarters on Saturday that the Ibrox side were 48 hours from administration. However, there were three funding options to select from to rule out that extreme measure and it’s understood that one of Nash’s last acts in his role was to sign off the October payroll so there was no danger of Ibrox staff going without their monthly wage. The Rangers board rejected Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy's 11th-hour loan offer . However, the Ashley loan will only guarantee solvency into the New Year, when fresh investment or creative work on retail contracts with the Newcastle United owner could create extra funds. Furthermore, the club must then construct a credible case for the accounts to June 2014 being signed off by auditors Deloitte as a going concern in advance of an Annual General Meeting before the end of this year. It would be no surprise if, further down the line, speculation mounted about the future of Ally McCoist. The Rangers legend is known not to be favoured by influential members of the hierarchy and the removal of two men with whom he enjoyed a mutually-respectful relationship is not a positive for the manager. Although no official statement was forthcoming from the rival parties to Ashley on Saturday night, there was grave concern and fury among those ranks and of fearful supporters who, more than two years ago, watched as administrators appointed by Craig Whyte handed over the assets of Rangers to Charles Green for £5.5m. Those close to the opposition camps — the King/Letham alliance and Kennedy — fear that Ashley has effectively seized control of the soul and direction of Rangers for as little as £2m. Some believe it’s inconceivable that the SFA can accept the Ashley deal when other, credible, fully-funded alternatives are on the table, such as the £3m Kennedy loan or the package of £16m put forward by King, Letham and Paul Murray, split between equity and immediate loans, to ease the club through the current crisis. Supporters’ group the Union of Fans urged the SFA to intervene earlier this month to see off Ashley’s power grab. However, the SFA plan only to write to Rangers seeking clarification regarding suggestions his loan has been accepted with boardroom appointment caveats. Ashley signed an undertaking with the SFA that he would not own more than 10 per cent of Rangers shares and that he would not exert control and influence over the day-to-day running of the club. However, that was drafted in the post-liquidation days, designed to protect against a block shareholding influence and framed around being in the best interests of the club. Any bid by the SFA to intervene could lead to legal steps and Rangers could then argue that it is Ashley’s influence that is now in those best interests because, without his funding, they would once again be in dire financial straits.","Mike Ashley tightens his grip on Rangers boardroom with £2m upfront loan .

"Tenderloin of wild venison sounds tasty and badger curry could be a rather interesting dish. A Plymouth doctor, Austin Hunt, boasted about feeding his family roadkill. He said he had created dishes such as badget balti and tenderloin of wild venison . However, one’s appetite for them might be tempered by the fact that the meat for both was provided by dead animals left on the road. They are two of the meals cooked up by surgeon Austin Hunt – who regularly manages to feed his family with roadkill. But his unorthodox recipes have prompted a warning from police officers. They have cautioned the public not to copy his actions, claiming that eating roadkill can put people at risk of poisoning. Mr Hunt has revealed his passion for turning mangled animal carcasses into tasty, nutritious dishes including tenderloin of wild venison and badger curry. The consultant in acute medicine and renal failure serves his ‘free, ethical,’ food to his three children as well as dinner party guests. Mr Hunt began his culinary adventure by taking home a dead badger. His children – aged nine, seven and four – looked on as he butchered the male animal and made it into a curry, despite the fact that his wife Sally is a strict vegetarian. He said of the process: ‘The effort required to produce edible flesh from roadkill is considerable, and skinning an old boar badger demands a technique akin to chiselling. ‘For some days, thick black bristles were still turning up on the kitchen surfaces – much to the fury of my vegetarian wife. ‘I opted to serve the badger in a curry sauce, persuading myself that no dangerous microbes could survive seven hours of slow casseroling with a ton of spices.’ He went on to say: ‘In truth, the flesh resembled some dodgy meat substitute from a long-expired Army ration pack, and despite the lengthy cooking it remained tooth-breakingly tough. 'All seven guests at our roadkill initiation evening tried the main course – eventually – although only two came back for seconds. ‘Our curried badger might not have been the best dish ever served at a dinner party, but it was certainly the most talked about.’ ‘Our curried badger might not have been . the best dish ever served at a dinner party, but it was certainly the . most talked about, surgeon Austin Hunt said of his recipe . Mr Hunt, who works at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon,  and lives on Dartmoor, revealed  that he now regularly eats deer he finds on the side of the road, even offering bottles of wine to colleagues who tip him off about the presence of a carcass. He believes that roadkill has improved his diet, saved him money and is helping to broaden his children’s minds. Mr Hunt added: ‘A deer carcass provides around £300 worth of prime meat, and distributing this among friends results in plenty of return dinner invitations. ‘Roadkill venison is also an ethical food and a number of usually vegetarian friends have eschewed their principles on occasion because they are happy to eat meat obtained in this way.’ While picking up roadkill is not illegal in Britain, it is illegal to take home an animal if you have knocked it down yourself. A thigh of badger used by Doctor Austin Hunt to create what he describes as 'free, ethical' food. Police warn that eating roadkill can cause poisoning . However Devon and Cornwall Police said motorists could be putting their health at risk by eating their roadside finds. Wildlife officer Sergeant Ryan Canning said police are frequently called out to collisions between cars and deer and the resulting meat would not be suitable to eat. He explained: ‘You may have driven down that road an hour before and returned to find the carcass of a deer, but sometimes police and a vet have already been and gone and such a find would not in any way be fit for human consumption. ‘There are occasions where a zoo or educational organisation has come out to remove an already deceased carcass. ‘However I would strongly urge people to be cautious. Make sure that you know the absolute full history of the death of an animal before you think about taking it home, cooking and eating it.’ He added: ‘Please do not just assume that it died as a result of being struck by a vehicle.’","Surgeon Austin Hunt, from Devon, turns roadkill into meals for his children .

"Motorists are to be hit with a £1 charge every time they drop off family or friends at Aberdeen International Airport and they will face a fine if they linger for over 10 minutes. The plan has been met with anger from visitors and taxi drivers but airport officials insist the fee and £30 parking fine are necessary to reduce congestion and improve safety in drop-off zones. Drivers will be monitored with an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system when the charges come into effect on January 7, The Press and Journal reported. Motorists will be hit with a £30 fine if they stay for longer than 10 minutes in the drop-off zone . Carol Benzie, Aberdeen airport’s managing director, told the newspaper that management are concerned about the safety of visitors and staff. She said: ‘An increase in traffic using the airport has resulted in some examples of dangerous behaviour among drivers and the new system will allow us to better manage that behaviour.’ But the plan has been blasted by non-airport taxi drivers, who say they were not consulted before the charges were announced. They warn that it will likely lead to higher fares for airport journeys as only official airport taxis will be exempt from the charge, and there are fears the fee could increase in the future. And the worry on a larger scale is that other airports could follow suit, charging for what could be a drop off of a matter of seconds. Unfair? Non-official airport taxis will be forced to pay the £1 fee every time they drop off customers . Stevie Robertson, a taxi representative for the Unite union, said: ‘It seems an unfair charge to be passed onto the customers. We don’t want to do that but it’s a cost that’s being imposed that we have very little control over.’ Coaches will also have to pay the fee while disabled motorists with blue badges will be granted a 30-minute grace period. The charged forecourt area will be controlled by barriers, with drivers being asked to pay on exit, The Press and Journal reported.

As the 32-year-old tried to deposit a number of cheques for his company, he walked in on the ambush.

An X-ray shows the 20-caliber bullet lodged in the 32-year-old's chest. Another bullet, which hit his waist, was removed within days of the ambush in July but two sets of doctors refused to operate on the bullet lodged in Mr Sharma's heart, for fear surgery would kill the newly married man . But eventually doctors at the Sal Hospital in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, agreed to take on Mr Sharma's case and successfully removed the bullet on September 23 . A week after the robbery, surgeons at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College in Aligarh, removed the bullet in Mr Sharma's waist. But doctors refused to remove the bullet in his heart, fearing the newly married man would lose his life. A second referral to Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi saw Mr Sharma refused for surgery a second time. For two months he lived with the bullet lodged in his heart. Eventually doctors at Sal Hospital in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, accepted the challenge and agreed to take on Mr Sharma's case. They successfully removed the 20-caliber bullet yesterday. Mr Sharma has been left with an impressive scar . Dr Anil Jain, Cardiac Surgeon, who led the surgery, said: 'It was a very rare case and extraordinary that he was living with a bullet in his heart for two months. 'The bullet was lodged in the heart muscle before the apex of the left ventricle, one of the two chambers of the heart. 'It was just a millimetre away from puncturing the left chamber and could've killed him. 'Whenever the heart pumped, the bullet would've moved proving fatal. 'It's a unique story and he's been a very lucky man.' During the three-hour surgery, the team of five doctors put Mr Sharma on a life support machine so they could take out the bullet and stitching up the vital organs with less risk. His brother Manish Sharma, 38, said: 'I am relieved that my brother has got a new life. 'I am thankful to the doctors for accepting our case and giving him his life back.' Mr Sharma, who is now recovering at the hospital's ICU, wants to preserve the bullet as a reminder of how close he came to death. The bullet will also be used as evidence in the case against the burglars, who are still on the run.","Bharat Sharma was shot on July 22 as he tried to pay in cheques at the bank .

"Is Yaya right to be angry over birthday snub? Is Yaya right to be angry over birthday snub? Now share your opinion . Yaya Toure risks further enraging Manchester City after admitting he wants to end his career at Barcelona and could leave the club this summer. The 31-year-old's future at the Etihad Stadium is shrouded in doubt after a bizarre episode on Tuesday when his agent Dimitry Seluk launched an inexplicable attack on the Premier League champions. The Ukrainian claimed Toure - who cost City £24million four years ago - was ready to leave after the club 'snubbed' his birthday last week. VIDEO Scroll down for Yaya Toure: My career's great; going to City was the right move . Ambition: Toure has been linked with a return 'home' to Barcelona after a lack of respect from City . Happy return? Toure has indicated that he wants to end his career back at Barcelona, who sold him for £24m . Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week . Slice it up: The controversial cake . City have kept their counsel up until now and will block any attempt to lever a move but Toure himself has confirmed that he wants out. Asked on beIN SPORTS whether he could be playing for another club: 'Yes, I have talked before about ending my career at Barcelona - but we don't know because football is moving fast and you never know about tomorrow. 'Because of the brilliant season Manchester City have had, everybody is talking about me and everything is open and we don't know tomorrow.' Worryingly for City fans - who face the prospect of losing their talisman on a triviality - the Ivorian reiterated his endorsement of Seluk's actions. 'Dimitry is always on the phone and he knows what he has to do because I trust him a lot,' he added. 'The main thing now is just to try and focus on the World Cup and he knows what he has to do because we were always open about everything and I am able to talk with him for a couple of days now.' Toure and Seluk's relationship is a strong one; the player has been under him for the majority of his career, calls him 'dad' and named his second child after him. Sticking the knife in? Toure's cake was dwarfed by that of Manchester City's owners celebrating the title . Sliding in: Despite the outburst, Toure is paid handsomely by City, north of £200,000-a-week . And they are no strangers to causing . mischief within Carrington. Seluk has overtly poked City enough in the . past to cajole more money for his client in the past. Toure . is now sitting on more than £200,000-a-week and accused the club of treating him . as a 'nobody' at a party attended by owner Sheik Mansour and other . dignitaries in Abu Dhabi last Tuesday. Complaints . over a lack of a birthday cake by the central midfielder's . representative stretch the truth somewhat; he was handed two - one on a . flight and another at the team's hotel - while a Facebook message . received 250,000 'likes' from supporters.

But at City . Yaya is no hero. He’s nobody. That’s how the club make him feel. ‘He’s . very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club. And he will . if things carry on like this.

"Raheem Sterling has been blasted by former England hero Alan Shearer for being too 'tired' to start for England against Estonia. The Liverpool starlet dropped to the bench for Roy Hodgson's side's clash in Tallinn, which saw Wayne Rooney's free-kick hand England three points. But Sterling faces a backlash over his reasons for starting the game on the bench. Raheem Sterling has been blasted by Alan Shearer for not starting England's match against Estonia . Sterling (right) was dropped to the bench after telling boss Roy Hodgson (left) that he is feeling too tired to play . 'I genuinely have never heard something like that in my career. Certainly not in a squad I was involved in,' Shearer wrote in the Sun. 'If I had, as either captain of Newcastle or England, I'd have gone straight up to the player and said ""are you sure?"" and that's putting it mildly.' Former striker Shearer - the Premier League's all-time leading goalscorer - went on to draw unfavourable comparisions between Sterling and the general public. Sterling (centre) watches on from the substitutes bench as England were in action against Estonia .

"Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries . A four-year-old girl who was surrounded by drugs and squalor died from severe injuries after being forced to ride a 50kg motorbike despite repeatedly crashing it, an inquest has heard. Tragic Chloe Valentine, from Adelaide, died in January 2012 from injuries sustained over a three-day period in the backyard of a home at Ingle Farm, in the city's northeast. Chloe's grandmother, Belinda Valentine, has pleaded pleads for changes within Families SA, calling for specialised staff training to prevent such deaths. Despite Families SA receiving 20 notifications of Chloe's dreadful circumstances, she was never removed from her drug-using mother. Chloe's short life was marred by chronic neglect, an inquest was told today. Reports were made of rats in one squalid residence; old nappies, rotting food and bugs in another; drug use and violence in Chloe's presence; and her being left in front of the TV for long periods. Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, on Monday gave an overview of the case at the start of the inquest into the death of Chloe in January 2012. She died after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard. Ashley Polkinghorne, 22, and her then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, are in jail after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. They waited more than eight hours before calling an ambulance after Chloe eventually became unconscious. 'The pain she must have endured in the last few hours of her short life is difficult to comprehend,' said Ms Kereru. She outlined the extensive involvement of Families SA, dating back to when Polkinghorne became pregnant at 15, and its responses to numerous neglect notifications from family, friends and other agencies. One concerned friend recorded a conversation with Polkinghorne which was passed on to Families SA. Chloe died at the hands of her parents in Adelaide in January 2012 . She was repeatedly forced to crash the motorbike over a three-day period . The four-year-old suffered massive head injuries and her mum and partner were later jailed for neglect . 'Miss Polkinghorne claimed she was a better mother when she took amphetamines, as she would pick up Chloe and feed her and change her nappy ... as opposed to when she was drunk, when she would prop Chloe's bottle up to her mouth and leave it there,' Ms Kereru said. Polkinghorne was reported as having told her crying daughter: 'shut up you bitch', and having her child in her arms when a partner punched Polkinghorne twice. When questioned about this, Polkinghorne said Chloe had not cried 'as she had got used to violent incidents'. Drug user Ashley Polkinghorne was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter for the criminal neglect after the death of her daughter . Polkinghorne said Chloe had not cried 'as she had got used to violent incidents' Polkinghorne's partner Benjamin McPartland was also jailed for criminal neglect . She was often visited by Families SA workers, but usually on scheduled dates when they found Chloe's living conditions acceptable. One friend who contacted Families SA about her concerns, said: 'This is one that will slip through the cracks, Ms Polkinghorne can be a very convincing liar'. Police advised they found Chloe in the care of a 15-year-old who was drinking in a park on a cold night and on another occasion at a shopping centre, while Polkinghorne was in a nearby liquor shop. Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 . Belinda Valentine told The Advertiser the inquest which started today should not turn into a 'witch hunt'. She said: 'We can't change what happened to Chloe but, as a society, we have to learn from the tragedy of her death to prevent more children being damaged.' The coroner will hear evidence from numerous witnesses, including those who notified Families SA and the organisation's workers.","Chloe Valentine from Adelaide died at the hands of her neglectful mother Ashley Polkinghorne and her partner Benjamin McPartland .

"Being backed into a corner is the kind of scenario that instinctively appeals to Andy Murray, and on Tuesday night he duly came out fighting to keep his hopes alive at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. Buoyed by the unconditional support of nearly 18,000 in London's O2 Arena, knowing that defeat would effectively end his season, the 27 year-old Scot defused the sometimes erratic power of Canadian Milos Raonic. His 6-3, 7-5 victory was a far more convincing display than he managed in his opener against Kei Nishikori and keeps him in the hunt for a semi-final place when he plays Roger Federer on Thursday in the last round robin stage. VIDEO Scroll down for Andy Murray: It's nice to have the opportunity to go through . Andy Murray punches the air in celebration after beating Milos Raonic 6-3, 7-5 on Tuesday evening . Murray hits a shot during his victory against  Raonic in the ATP World Tour Finals Group B clash . The Scot plays a forehand in the round robin singles match at the O2 Arena in London . Canadian Raonic plays a return shot against Murray but was unable to beat the former Wimbledon champion . Murray will face Roger Federer on Thursday in the last match of the round robin stage . 'On Sunday there was not much magic, but today I came up with some good shots at the right moment,' he said.' Milos did not serve as well as he can and that helped. It is always a pleasure to play against Roger - I am looking forward to it. He is one of the greatest ever. I will need to play well to get through.' The mathematics of qualification now becomes infernal and, depending on the outcome of Nishikori's singles against Raonic, he could still beat the Swiss master and go out. In fact 16 different permutations of results present themselves on Thursday, but by the time he goes on court  he will know exactly what he has to do. With Tuesday night's straight sets triumph Murray ensured that the Swiss is not automatically through, despite him earlier registering his second win with a 6-3, 6-2 win over the Japanese. Federer needs to win just one set to make the semis, and given that he has beaten Murray relatively easily on all three occasions he has met him in East London it will be a tall order for the Scot. Calculators may need to be at the ready, although if Raonic wins any kind of victory will be enough for the British player. After careering round Asia and Europe to try and qualify for this event – battling against the odds again bringing out his best - a place in the last four would be fitting reward for the British number one. There is plenty to do yet as Federer has looked very impressive and he never drops his intensity for this occasionally testy rivalry. Raonic's his hair obediently stood to attention as usual on Tuesday, but luckily for Murray his overall game was less orderly. For the most part the Scot tended towards the solid rather than spectacular, but with the Canadian's first serve missing half the time and his forehand contributing 23 unforced errors he created enough openings to squeeze through. Murray makes a grand entrance at the O2 Arena in London ahead of the clash against Raonic . Murray smiles at a mascot as he enters the court on day three of the tournament . The evening crowd was notably more partisan than Sunday, and if Murray was seeking assurance that not everyone down south has deserted him in the wake of his nationalist leaning tweeting activity in September then this was it. He seemed to feed off that, having looked flat on Sunday. After missing two break points in the fourth game poked back a 136 mph serve at 3-2 on another break point which Raonic obligingly sent back beyond the baseline. When Murray went ahead for 2-1 in the second all the momentum was on his side, only for his habit of handing breaks straight back to resurface, and the Canadian duly levelled. The confidence seeped back into Raonic and Murray, his language occasionally matching the blue court colour, was forced to cling on as his opponent produced his best tennis. Murray, with a poppy on his sleeve, wipes his face with a towel during a break in play . One Direction star Liam Payne attended the match and was cheering on Murray . Then the home player pulled out two brilliant defensive backhands from being way out of position and that gave him what turned out to be the decisive break. Serving it out was not comfortable, but one last wayward Raonic forehand did the trick. Earlier Federer had passed more landmarks in his remarkable career when he notched what was his 70th win of the season. Nobody as old as 33 has scored that many victories in a year, as far back as ATP records go, and he is now only seven off completing a thousand over his whole career. He was again utterly convincing as he kept alive his slender hopes of usurping Novak Djokovic for the year end number one ranking. He said he was already delighted with the sheer volume of wins achieved in this rebound season: 'I think it (70) is a great number. I played only the big tournaments this year, I chased all the Masters events, the Grand Slams. It's not easy to win in them because the margins are small.' 1) Regardless of score, if R.

"Star Wars creator George Lucas has made millions from merchandise on the back of his famous films, but even he would surely never have dreamt of this. A French fast food chain has revealed a promotional snack which really has gone to the Dark Side, a Star Wars-inspired burger with completely black buns. The burger chain Quick cooked up the black-looking bun - named Dark Vador - to tie in with the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in 3D. Peckish: The Star Wars burger has a distinctly overdone look . Although the buns look like decidedly . burned, they are in fact simply dyed, and have two beef patties with . cheese, lettuce and tomato inbetween. The relevance is questionable given that Darth Vader only appears in The Phantom Menace as 10-year-old Anakin Skywalker. As . well as the Dark Vador burger, Quick have also created an . only-slightly-more appealing Jedi burger, and a Dark Burger, based on . Darth Maul. These aren't the burgers you're looking for: The Dark Vador burger features completely black buns, which are dyed rather than burnt. The meals will be served until March 1 this year - although any Brits who have ever had to fill up at the fast food outlets on long journeys around the country may decide they are yet another reason to steer clear. The stunt is not the first time the French fast food chain have raised eyebrows with their promotional material. In February 2010 the chain decided to . serve only halal meat in eight restaurants, sparking criticism from . politicians that its menu discriminates against non-Muslims. Would you like fries with that Mr Vader: Whether the sith lord, pictured here in The Empire Strikes Back, would approve of a burger in his name is debateable . The French chain previously raised eyebrows when it introduced halal-only menus in February last year . And in November 2010, Quick said it intended to offer foie gras 'burgers' at bargain prices as a treat for customers ahead of Christmas. Quick burger's 'Supreme Foie Gras' consisted of the normally expensive duck foie gras, beef, relish and lettuce and go on sale for only 5 euros ($6.57) at more than 350 outlets across France.",French fast food chain unveils Dark Vador meal .
"A Chinese woman has claimed she was left with a scratched eyeball after her iPhone 5 exploded. The phone user,  surnamed Li from Dalian, said she felt that her iPhone was hot after talking on it for 40 minutes. She said that when she tried to end the call on the touch screen phone it was unresponsive and then it exploded at the top right hand corner, cracking the screen and sending particles of the device into her eyes. Concerning: A Chinese woman is claiming she was left with a scratched eyeball after her iPhone 5 exploded . Li said that she bought the phone last September and had dropped it on one occasion, leaving the phone with a small crack on its upper right corner, reported Want China Times. Last month it was claimed that an air stewardess was killed by an electric shock when she answered a call on her iPhone 5 while it was recharging. News of the death of Ma . Ailun, 23, was posted on the internet by her sister, prompting criticism . of Apple among the country’s millions of iPhone users. ‘I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging,’ her sister wrote. Miss Ma, who was due to marry in . August, was said to have bought her iPhone 5 in December from an . official store in her home town in Xinjiang province. Her brother told a Hong Kong newspaper the phone had been handed to Chinese authorities for examination. Tragic: Ma Ailun, 23, a former flight attendant with . China Southern Airlines, died when she picked up her . iPhone as it charged at home, her family said. Ma often took pictures of herself with her phone and posted them online (above) There were also safety warnings about . the millions of cheap copycat phones and chargers on the market. Apple . products sell out quickly in China, the demand fuelling the factories . churning out fake iPhones, iPads and iPods. In 2011, 22 fake Apple stores were uncovered in one Chinese city, Kunming, alone. Apple promised to investigate the death – a blow for the technology company in its second largest market after the US. It declined to say if it was investigating an isolated case or if it was considering a product recall. The safety scare is the latest incident to blight the company’s reputation in China. In April, Apple apologised to Chinese . consumers and changed iPhone warranty policies, following criticism of . its after-sales service. Two years ago conditions at some of the factories making Apple products were blamed for a spate of  worker suicides. Miss Ma's brother, Yuelun, told Apple Daily that the family believe she died from an electric shock while answering a call and that the phone and its accessories have been handed over to the Chinese authorities.

Her sister then wrote on social networking site Weibo: 'I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging.' She said Ma had bought the iPhone in December at an official Apple store . and was using the original charger to recharge the phone when the . incident occurred. Apple, said it had launched a 'thorough . investigation', adding: 'We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic . incident and offer our condolences to the family. Apple's mobile gadgets have a generally good safety record with few serious defects reported since the first generation iPhone was launched in 2007. However, as smartphones become more powerful, with larger batteries needing more electricity to power them, there have been growing reports of dangerous malfunctions that have dogged the firm in recent years. February 2013 - Marketing manager Shibani Bhujle, from New York, claimed the battery of her iPhone 4S spontaneously melted, oozing acid that destroyed the handset. January 2013 - An Oregon fire crew blamed an apartment blaze on an overheated MacBook battery which dropped onto a mattress. December 2011 - An iPhone 4 reportedly began . emitting smoke in a plane cabin on a flight to Australia. December 2011 - It was reported that an iPhone 4 was . plugged in to charge overnight in Brazil when it began to emit smoke and sparks as . its owner slept nearby. November 2011 - Apple recalled all . iPod Nanos amid fears the batteries on older models were prone to . overheating and catching fire. In 2010, a man in northeast China . was killed by an electric shock when making a phone call with a handset . that was being recharged with an unauthorized charger, according to the . China Consumers Association. In 2008 a . 3G owner claimed his phone overheated in his pocket and burned his leg . while he was asleep. But Apple is not the only smartphone maker to have come under fire for allegedly faulty gadgets. A Swiss teenager suffered second and third degree burns when her Samsung Galaxy S3 apparently exploded in her pocket. In May, a Reddit user posted pictures on the site of his charred Galaxy S3, claiming he was 'awoken by a loud noise and a . weird squeaking sound' to find it smouldering by the side of his bed. 'We will fully investigate and co-operate with authorities in this matter.' China’s popular social media chat . sites, called Weibos, were flooded with posts urging fellow iPhone users . not to make calls while charging their phones. And many warned to only use original chargers and avoid plugging in cheap copy chargers which are widely available. 'Be sure to select only qualified, certifiable  products -  the best is the original because safety is most assured. Don’t buy fake chargers!' warned poster Zhao Chao. Apple products are  popular in China but new items are quickly cloned by the country’s infamous copy merchants who produce look-a-like fake phones, laptops, iPads and iPods, which are often hard to distinguish from originals. Mobile phones have a relatively low . electrical output of between 3 to 5 volts - much less than the 36 volts . it takes for a person to feel a shock. But experts say if the charger or the circuit has a problem, such as a broken wire, it can lead to a shock of 220 volts. Johnny Sin Kin-on, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told the South China Morning Post: 'There is a risk using an electrical device while its installed battery is being charged, be it a shaver or a phone.' The iPhone 5's much-vaunted launch . last September saw thousands of Apple fans queue for days outside Apple . stores across the world to be the first to get their hands on the . state-of-the-art gadget. Grinning customers were greeted with . cheers and high fives from staff as they walked into stores ready to . grab the latest hotly-anticipated smartphone.

"Jeffrey M. Sirois told police he intended to send a video to his girlfriend, but mistakenly sent it to the players . A high school varsity girls soccer coach told police he intended to send a video of him pleasuring himself to his girlfriend, but mistakenly sent it to the teenage girls on his team. Jeffrey M. Sirois who worked at E.O. Smith High School was arrested earlier this month on charges of risk of injury to a child, breach of peace and obscenity, reports The Journal Inquirer of Manchester. The arrest warrant says the 57-year-old of Lebanon intended to send the video to his girlfriend, but accidentally sent it to a Snapchat group of his soccer players who are juveniles. Five players attending the high school in Storrs said they viewed the 10-second video at a pizza restaurant. The girls told varsity girls volleyball coach and in turn the police were contacted. The video does not show Sirois' face but showed furniture which police checked against that in his home. In an interview with state police, Sirois said he never intentionally sent anything inappropriate to his players, reports Courant.com. 'I was attempted to send a video of myself in which I was masturbating,' he said according to the warrant. 'I was making the video to send to my girlfriend. It is something she and I occasionally do.' He said when only realised what he had done when he checked to see if his girlfriend had received the clip. He told police that he then saw that he had sent it to the girls and immediately he deleted the video. Jeffrey M. Sirois who worked at E.O. Smith High School (pictured) was arrested earlier this month on charges of risk of injury to a child, breach of peace and obscenity, reports The Journal Inquirer of Manchester.

"Exercise can vastly improve the lives of osteoarthritis sufferers, health chiefs said yesterday. Too many patients believe nothing they do will lessen their discomfort, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The institute insists that physical exertion can help the condition and ease pain. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has today said exercise should be the principal treatment for those diagnosed with osteoarthritis . Around 8.5million people in the UK have osteoarthritis, which causes joint pain and stiffness. Issuing its new guidance, Nice says exercise should be the principal treatment. ‘There’s a common but mistaken belief that osteoarthritis is an inevitable part of ageing and that it will get worse – that’s not the case,’ said Professor Mark Baker, clinical practice chief at Nice. ‘The guidance highlights that the core treatment for osteoarthritis remains exercise – this not only helps relieve pain for some but also improves function.’ Nice also called for GPs to refer patients to surgeons for possible joint replacements before they became incapacitated – rather than it being a last line of treatment. The new advice warns doctors that a patient’s age, sex, smoking history or whether they are obese should not be barriers to referral for joint surgery. Osteoarthritis should not be considered an 'inevitable part of ageing that will only get worse', say Nice . Professor Karen Middleton, of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: ‘These guidelines should help challenge the perception that many people often have about osteoarthritis being a normal part of ageing and that nothing can be done. ‘Physiotherapists provide effective treatment for the symptoms of osteoarthritis and deliver expert advice on physical activity and weight-management strategies to reduce pain and improve mobility. 'Nice has recognised how important this is for the day-to-day management of the condition and the positive impact it has on patients' quality of life.' Judi Rhys of Arthritis Care said the charity's experts were 'firm believers in the value of appropriate exercise for people with osteoarthritis'. Nice said overweight patients should be encouraged to lose weight while drugs such as paracetamol and ibuprofen gel should be considered for pain relief. Professor Alan Silman,  of Arthritis Research UK, said: 'It's important that people with osteoarthritis find a type of exercise they enjoy doing. 'Everyone can benefit from some sort of exercise, regardless of their condition. 'Stretching. strengthening and aerobic exercises are the ideal combination.'","National Institute for Health and Care Excellence say exercise should be the 'principal treatment' for osteoarthritis .

"One in 20 pupils is now being taught in a grammar school, as England witnesses the quiet return of state-funded selection. The proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 – and almost double the historic low of 1986. Now for the first time in 35 years, some 5 per cent of children are being taught selectively. Michael Gove is under fire for failing to promote new grammars due to Lib Dem opposition . The law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding. But the existing grammars have been expanding and taking on new pupils. Over the past 25 years, their pupil numbers have soared by tens of thousands. There are now more than 161,000 pupils in state-funded selective schools. Education Secretary Michael Gove has come under fire from Tory backbenchers for failing to promote new grammars – largely because of opposition from the Lib Dems. Graham Brady, chairman of the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said: ‘These figures prove that there is huge parental demand for grammar schools and selective education in the secondary system. Graham Brady said the figures prove there is a huge parental demand for grammar schools . ‘This shows parents are voting with their feet whenever they are given the choice.’ He added: ‘It is really time for the Government to free up the provision of grammar school places in areas where they don’t already exist to release this pent-up demand.’ The figures on the return of the grammar school come from a report compiled by the House of Commons Library. It shows that in 1947, there were 1,207 state-funded grammars in England teaching 37.8 per cent of secondary school pupils. By 1974, there were just 675, covering 12 per cent. A record low was reached in 1986, when just 3 per cent of pupils were taught in state-funded grammars. And by 1989, there were only 150 state-funded selective schools. Since then a slow revival has taken place, largely thanks to the grant-maintained schools policy implemented by John Major, which freed schools from the control of local authorities. But Tony Blair’s government banned new state-funded selective schools, and the total number has now levelled out at 164. Just seven local authority areas still have a fully selective system: Trafford, Buckinghamshire, Slough, Torbay, Southend, Kent and Medway. A further 29 have partially selective secondary systems, with grammars and secondary moderns alongside comprehensives. Despite this, the proportion of pupils taught in grammar schools has risen from 4.6 per cent to 5 per cent – thanks to their gradual expansion. The Commons report concludes: ‘There has been a very gradual but steady increase in the number and proportion of pupils at existing grammar schools over the past 25 years as their average size has increased.’ Tony Blair¿s government banned new state-funded selective schools, and the total number has now levelled out at 164 . Robert McCarthy, chairman of the National Grammar Schools Association, said: ‘Grammar schools have been expanding to offer additional places over the past three decades. ‘This expansion has been the equivalent of 30 new schools with 1,000 pupils apiece. It is indicative of the strength of parental demand for selective education. ‘We now have a situation where in many of the existing 164 state grammars there are ten applications for every place. ‘Hundreds of applicants pass the exam but do not get a place at a school appropriate to their ability because there are not enough places. ‘The Government should now look at these statistics and lessen the restrictions.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘We believe good schools, including grammars, should be able to expand to meet the demands of parents. ‘Through the expansion of the academies and free school programmes we are transforming the education system so all children are able to access a good local school.’","Proportion of pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 .
The law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding.
Michael Gove has been criticised as there is a 'huge parental demand' for more grammar schools ."
"A mechanic has told how he forced open a refrigerated yogurt truck to free suspected illegal immigrants who he thought were dying. The 24 Africans had been frantically banging on the sides of the lorry, parked in Whitfield, near Dover in Kent, in a bid to alert passers-by. The immigrants, all young male and female Eritrean nationals, are thought to have been concealed in the trailer for hours before being released. Scroll down for video . A mechanic has told how he forced open a refrigerated yogurt truck to free suspected illegal immigrants who he thought were dying . The trailer, which was carrying a cargo of yoghurt, had travelled on a lorry on a cross-Channel ferry from France to Dover. It is not known how long the men and women had been in the truck before they left Calais and were later found in a street in Whitfield at around 11.50am on Friday. Andy Groombridge, 44, a mechanic who runs a nearby vehicle repair business, said: 'I had to act quickly because I thought people might be dying in the back of the lorry. They were screaming for help. 'I managed to break the security seal on the trailer. As I opened the doors I could see there was a large group of them, all gasping for air. The 24 Africans had been frantically banging on the sides of the lorry, parked in Whitfield, near Dover in Kent, in a bid to alert passers-by . 'They desperately needed oxygen so they staggered out into the air and just kept breathing in the air. They were shouting ""oxygen, oxygen"". 'They were all really hot and sweaty and looked very dazed and tired.' Mr Groombridge said he had been eating breakfast when he 'heard the commotion' and saw other people standing by the lorry who said they had contacted police. But he said police were 'taking too long' and that the voices were 'getting more desperate'. 'We were told not to open it but the people were banging more and more frantically for help,' he said. 'As they came out I could see men and women, all young, aged around 18-20. I counted 24 in total. 'After a while they seemed ok but two of them were sick. They said they had been eating the yoghurts inside the lorry. 'All of them seemed very relieved to be out of the lorry. We sat them on the floor and eventually they were smiling and texting on their phones. 'The police turned up around 10-15 minutes later and took them away. 'I saw the driver, he was Hungarian and he was in shock. He had no idea they were in his lorry.' A Kent Police spokesman said: 'We were called after a group of suspected illegal immigrants were found in the back of a lorry in Whitfield. 'Officers arrested one man on suspicion of facilitation offences.' A Port of Dover spokesman confirmed: 'A vehicle was detained at Whitfield containing 24 Eritrean nationals. 'Port of Dover Police assisted and the matter has now been passed over to Kent Police and Border Force.' The incident comes just days after a suspected illegal immigrant was discovered after clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it was being driven from Calais to a suburban road in Kent . It comes just two days after six illegal immigrants were found in the back of a grain lorry in Kent. Last week, a suspected illegal immigrant was discovered after clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it drove from Calais to a suburban road in Kent. The man, believed to be in his late teens, is thought to have tied himself to the chassis of the vehicle before it entered the Channel Tunnel. He emerged after the two-hour journey as Paul Coles and his daughter, Joanne, were returning the vehicle to its owner in  Ashford. Government to give £12million to join Anglo-French plan to tackle problem of illegal immigrants in Calais hoping to get to Britain . The UK Government will provide £12 million over three years to help tackle the problem of illegal immigrants at Calais hoping to gain entry to Britain. Home Secretary Theresa May and her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve reached a deal which will also see increased co-operation between the two countries' law enforcement agencies. The joint plan will also involve bolstering security at the French port, which has seen increasing number of migrants using it as a staging post for efforts to cross the English Channel. Home Secretary Theresa May (left) and her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve (right) reached a deal which will also see increased co-operation between the two countries' law enforcement agencies . Security and Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: 'Earlier today the Home Secretary and French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve set out a number of joint commitments to tackle problems at the port of Calais, including bolstering security. 'Their declaration also reaffirms their commitment to closer working by UK and French law enforcement agencies to target organised crime gangs behind people trafficking and smuggling. 'And the two countries will continue to push for action at European and international level to address the wider problem of illegal migration, of which Calais is just one very visible sign. 'The priority now is to implement the practical solutions that have been agreed.' A joint statement issued by Mrs May and Mr Cazeneuve set out plans to reduce the number of illegal migrants, including information campaigns and strengthened security. They also promised to 'respond to health emergencies and protect vulnerable people', particularly victims of human trafficking, but insisted that the measures would not encourage immigrants to gather in Calais. The UK will contribute five million euros (£4million) a year for three years to a joint intervention fund to help tackle the problems in Calais . The statement said they would 'ensure that all measures taken will deter illegal migrants from congregating in and around Calais'. The UK will contribute five million euros (£4million) a year for three years to a joint intervention fund. Some of the money will be used to construct robust fences and increase security in the parking area at the port. Officials from both countries will work to improve the quality of border controls, possibly including the installation of new technology to address the dangers of migrants hiding in tankers and refrigerated lorries. The statement added: 'At the same time, efforts will be made to strengthen operational co-operation by establishing permanent joint mechanisms to deliver promptly the comprehensive action plan and enhance co-operation between British and French law enforcement agencies at the border. 'This will include helping to identify measures to ensure migrants do not breach the laws of either country or threaten the safety of Calais residents or those using the port. It will also support improved joint returns initiatives and further comprehensive action against those trying to evade immigration control.' The joint plan will also involve bolstering security at the French port, which has seen increasing number of migrants using it as a staging post for efforts to cross the English Channel . Information campaigns starting next month will explain ""the reality of illegal migration and its consequences in the United Kingdom"" and also set out information on asylum in France or assisted voluntary return. Police and border agencies on both sides will co-operate to tackle the organised criminal networks responsible for people smuggling. The National Crime Agency will second a full-time office to Ocriest, the French agency responsible for tackling illegal immigration, while the French border police will send two officers each month to work with the joint border intelligence unit in Folkestone. The ministers also resolved to push for European Union action on an ""evident migration crisis"" in the Mediterranean Sea.","Andy Groombridge forced open lorry to free migrants he thought were dying .

"Disincentivising jargon in official dialogue: The kind of language used by Sir Humphrey Appleby in Yes Minister, the archetypal civil service technocrat . It looks like the end of the road for ‘facilitating’ policies, ‘engaging with stakeholders’ and ‘disincentivising’ waste. Civil servants have been told to stop using meaningless jargon that confuses people about what the Government is doing. Instead of peppering policy announcements with buzzwords, Whitehall officials have been told they must address the public in ‘plain English’, according to new guidance. It is accompanied by a list of more than 30 banned words and phrases which recall the worst of Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister. Among the banned words and phrases are ‘slimming down’; ‘strengthen’ unless referring to a bridge or other structure; ‘drive’ a policy; or hold a ‘dialogue’ when they mean speaking to people. Also unacceptable are ‘foster’ unless it refers to children, ‘deploy’ unless it’s a lethal weapon, and ‘deliver’ - the guidance says ‘pizzas, post and services are delivered - not abstract concepts like ‘improvements or priorities’. The online style guide is published on the government’s new website www.gov.uk which has replaced those for individual departments, so all the information the public need is one place. However it is not to be referred to a ‘one stop shop’ - that term is firmly on the banned list, accompanied by the advice ‘we are government, not a retail outlet’. Civil servants are told announcements will be wasted if no-one can understand them. ‘We lose trust from our users if we write government ‘buzzwords’ and jargon. Often, these words are too general and vague and can lead to misinterpretation or empty, meaningless text.’ Instead they should use ‘buy’ instead of ‘purchase’, ‘help’ instead of ‘assist’, ‘about’ instead of ‘approximately’ and ‘like’ instead of ‘such as’, it says. ‘This isn’t ""dumbing down""', they are told. ‘Be open and specific. All audiences should understand our content...this is opening up government information to all.’ Although recent announcements suggest some departments still have a way to go. One from the Home Office about improvements to the visa system says it will give ‘the option for key businesses to complete the biometric enrolment part of applications for their staff from within their own offices, a significant service development that has facilitated the investment of nearly £2bn into the UK.’ Not a 'one stop shop': The online style guide is published on the government website www.gov.uk which has replaced those for individual departments, so all the information the public need is one place . Another recent announcement from the Cabinet Office reads: ‘The government is establishing a Global Learning Exchange on impact investment. Impact investment provides capital to deliver both social and financial results. ‘This multi-stakeholder exchange will focus on sharing best practice on ‘what works’ in impact investing. It will provide a shared platform to debate and create ideas as well as inviting new voices to the field.’ But there seems to have some been some improvement since environment department attracted ridicule last year for press notice when began: ‘The High Level Panel on the ‘Global Assessment of Resources for Implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020’ released its first findings at ‘COP 11’ of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) today.’ Steve Jenner, from the Plain English Campaign, said the new rules were welcome after officials have spent years announcing government policies in ‘departmental gobbledygook’. He said: ‘The fact that much of this is unintentionally hilarious suggests how bad things had become. The Plain English Campaign applauds this attempt to encourage clarity, though, and would be happy to assist any government department in this.’","New style guide attempts to slim down jargon in Whitehall announcements .

"No help for heroes: A record number of wounded war veterans have been denied disability benefits in the past year (file picture) A record number of wounded war veterans have been denied disability benefits in the past year after undergoing tests carried out by the Government’s controversial assessment company. Hundreds of injured ex-soldiers are being declared fit for work by Atos Healthcare in spite of physical and mental injuries they suffered in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last night, the Royal British Legion (RBL) announced a 72 per cent annual rise in former soldiers having their applications to receive Employment Support Allowance (ESA) turned down. Several hundred wounded personnel were denied the benefit on the basis of physical examinations conducted by Atos, according to the RBL. The company is contracted by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to assess benefits claimants’ capability to work. In one case, Lance Corporal Mark Dryden, 35 – a former member of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers who, after an explosion in Iraq, lost his right arm and the full use of his left – was asked by Atos assessors if he was left or right-handed. He is now taking his case against the DWP to a benefits tribunal. That case, and others, have led to accusations that Atos Healthcare is under intense pressure to produce assessments that enable the Government to reject benefits claims. Servicemen suffering from the mental scars of combat also complain that they have been turned down for disability benefits. Many injured troops have also described having to undergo demeaning physical tests by the firm. Last night, Peter Poole, the Strategic Director of Combat Stress, a charity serving ex-soldiers suffering from conditions such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, told The Mail on Sunday that, when questioned, wounded troops tended to play down the discomfort they were feeling because to make a fuss went against the military ethos. He said this led to Atos assessors marking down military candidates. Showing respect: Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh meets with patients and staff at the defence medical rehabilitation centre at Headley Court in Surrey last month . He added: ‘Atos needs to use its . resources to the best effect to ensure soldiers receive the best . attention. Many of the doctors and psychologists used by Atos might not . have treated troops before.’ Atos is in the process of assessing two million claimants for ESA, which replaced Incapacity Benefit in 2008. An Atos spokesman said: ‘A physical examination is a small part of the WCA process and people are only asked to do what they can and what is comfortable, with their specific consent.’ A DWP spokesman added: ‘The percentage of people getting long-term unconditional support has more than doubled in two years, but everyone has the right to appeal if they disagree with the outcome of their assessment.’","Hundreds of injured ex-soldiers declared fit for work by Atos Healthcare .

"Lord Hutton was contacted just three hours after the death of the weapons inspector . A previously unpublished document which reinforces claims that the investigation into the death of Dr David Kelly was an establishment ‘whitewash’ has been obtained by The Mail on Sunday. A letter written by Lord Hutton, who chaired the public inquiry into Dr Kelly’s death, shows he was asked to do the job just three hours after the Iraq weapons expert was found dead. At that point he had not been identified and no cause of death had been established. Hutton was contacted by Lord Falconer, Tony Blair’s former flatmate who was Lord Chancellor and played a key role in the events leading up to the Iraq War, and the handling of Dr Kelly’s death. The letter has come to light as campaigners prepare to mount a silent vigil in London on Thursday to mark the tenth anniversary of Dr Kelly’s death. It is the latest – and most striking – evidence of the extraordinary haste with which the Blair Government set up an inquiry to replace the usual coroner’s inquest. Dr Kelly’s body was found on the morning of July 18, 2003, in woods close to his Oxfordshire home, shortly after he was exposed as the source of a BBC news report questioning the grounds for war in Iraq. Critics have never been satisfied with . the conclusions of the Hutton Inquiry, which decided that Dr Kelly, 59, . who worked for the Ministry of Defence, died from loss of blood after . cutting his wrist with a blunt gardening knife. Dr David Kelly during questioning by the Commons select comittee, in London. Dr Kelly, who worked for the Ministry of Defence, died from loss of blood after cutting his wrist with a blunt gardening knife . Thursday’s vigil, to be held outside the High Court in London, will highlight the fact that no coroner’s inquest has ever been held into his death. There have been claims Hutton’s suicide verdict was flawed and failed to take account of key medical and other evidence. Some claim it was part of a cover-up. A decade after Dr Kelly was found dead, Mr Blair remains acutely sensitive to the accusation that he has ‘blood on his hands’ over the death. Lord Hutton’s letter to Lib Dem MP Norman Baker states: ‘On July 18, 2003, I was telephoned to my room in the House of Lords .  .  . I do not remember the precise time but my recollection is that it was about noon .  .  . I think the Lord Chancellor [Falconer] spoke to me and asked me to come to see him in his room in the Lords [where] he asked me to conduct an inquiry into the death of Dr David Kelly and I agreed to do so.’ According to police records, the 999 call to report the discovery of a body had been made barely three hours earlier, at 9.20am. The letter that has been newly revealed shows that Hutton was asked just hours after Dr Kelly's death . In addition, a Freedom of Information response from the Cabinet Office details two phone calls made that day, between Mr Blair, en route from Washington to Tokyo, and Lord Falconer. They spoke between 12.10pm and 12.13pm and again between 12.20pm and 12.25pm – the time when, according to Hutton’s letter, he was being appointed by Falconer. Although the details of the conversations have not been disclosed, the timing suggests Falconer may have consulted Blair on his choice of Hutton to lead the inquiry. Having secured Hutton, Falconer used an obscure law to replace  a coroner’s inquest with the non-statutory public inquiry. Police records show that by  midday on July 18, the only medical professionals who had viewed  Dr Kelly’s body on Harrowdown Hill were experienced ambulance crew members Vanessa Hunt and Dave Bartlett. Hutton was contacted by Lord Falconer (left), Tony Blair's (right) former flatmate who was Lord Chancellor and played a key role in the handling of Dr Kelly's death . Both have voiced scepticism about the . manner of his death, saying there was very little blood when they . arrived, not an amount consistent with a wrist slashed by a knife, and . believe his body was moved after the volunteer searchers found it but . before they saw it. Many . senior medical professionals have also argued that Dr Kelly could not . have bled to death by severing the tiny artery he apparently cut with . his blunt knife. Lord Falconer was also involved in the decision to overrule warnings that the war could be illegal. The organiser of Thursday’s protest, retired NHS worker Margaret Hindle, said: ‘I’m motivated by civic duty and respect for the law. I’ve long felt there was something suspicious about Dr Kelly’s death and the fact there hasn’t ever been a full inquest. I want to help secure one. Anyone is welcome to join us from 2pm to 4pm on Thursday.’ Neither Lord Falconer nor Lord Hutton was available for comment. By Simon Walters . Humble civil servant Dr Kelly was driven to his death by vicious Labour . This Thursday, a small group of people will mount a vigil outside the High Court in London to mark the tenth anniversary of the biggest British political scandal in half a century. Unlike most demonstrators, they have no political axe to grind, just one thing in common. They remain outraged by the tragic death of Dr David Kelly, a humble civil servant who devoted his life to serving his country. His ‘crime’ was to let the cat out of the bag over the Blair Government’s dirty secret: how it lied about Saddam Hussein’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction to con the British public into backing the Iraq War. And yet the truth would never have been known but for Dr Kelly. A few weeks after letting it slip, almost casually, to a BBC reporter, and inadvertently provoking a disgusting, Government inspired witch-hunt, he became another fatality of the Iraq War. I reported on Kelly’s death for this newspaper. Indeed, The Mail on Sunday played a not insignificant role in the controversy. I have never believed Kelly was murdered by secret agents acting for the Government or anyone else. But I do believe he was driven to his death by the Government as part of a desperate attempt to kill the scandal he exposed over tea at London’s Charing Cross Hotel with the BBC’s defence correspondent, Andrew Gilligan. Four weeks after the war ended, Gilligan told the Today programme on May 29, 2003, the Government probably knew all along its claims about WMDs were wrong. At first, the Government’s response was muted. Four days later, on June 1, The Mail on Sunday published an article by Gilligan which accused Blair’s spin doctor Alastair Campbell of ‘sexing up’ the WMD intelligence dossiers. Campbell made no complaint to this newspaper about the article then, or since. Alastair Campbell resigned as Tony Blair's press secretary a month after Dr Kelly's death . He couldn’t, because he knew it was true. And he knew that unlike the BBC, this newspaper had shown it was immune to his bullying. Instead, the Government aimed its fire at the BBC and Kelly, easy meat for Blair and Campbell.A vicious Downing Street operation to smear and ‘out’ Kelly was launched. If they thought this decent, private, patriotic man would crumble under the pressure, they were right. No one is suggesting they thought Kelly would end up dead. But he did. A Mail on Sunday reporter was with Blair on a trip to the Far East the day Kelly’s death was announced. The newsman challenged white-faced Blair at a press conference: ‘Have you got blood on your hands?’ Blair stared in stony silence – and walked off. Dr Kelly exposed the scandal over tea with the BBC¿s defence correspondent, Andrew Gilligan . For once, lost for words. With good reason. At the time, this newspaper was criticised for asking such a provocative question. Ten years later, not only does it look fair, the honest answer in the eyes of many, including me, would have been ‘Yes’. No one in Whitehall took Kelly’s death more badly than Campbell. Again, with good reason. When he resigned as Blair’s spin doctor a month after Kelly died, he ‘spun’ it as a long-planned decision. In truth, he was forced out by Blair, who realised he was out of control. Yes, it is true that the Hutton Inquiry into Kelly’s death blamed the BBC, not Blair and co for his death and none of the other Iraq inquiries have fully called them to account over their conduct of the war. But as we report above, Hutton is largely discredited. And the word is the Chilcot Inquiry into the war, due to report next year, will finally name and shame the guilty men. Regardless of minor flaws in the BBC’s report about the ‘sexed up’ intelligence, it remains the biggest British political scoop in modern times. Less entertaining than MPs expenses, yes, but far more important than fiddled duck houses. Despite inflicting appalling damage on the BBC for exposing the truth about the WMD dossiers, Campbell is regularly given a platform by the Corporation. Will they ask him for an interview on Thursday to talk about the tenth anniversary of the Kelly tragedy, a subject about which he knows more than most? Don’t hold your breath.","Letter from Lord Hutton shows he was asked three hours after the death .

"The grandfather of the Jamaican beauty queen who lost out on the Miss Universe crown has hit out at the pageant judges for being unclear about the requirements needed to win the show. Michael Fennell said that Kaci was the victim of ‘unwritten factors’ and that the judges should have stated if Miss Universe needed to have long hair. He said: 'If short hair is a problem why didn’t they say so in the contest?' Scroll down for video . After beating out stiff competition from USA, Netherlands, Jamaica and Ukraine, Miss Colombia Paulina Vega (right) became Miss Universe 2015, but some seemed to think it was Miss Jamaica Kaci Fennel (left) who deserved the crown. Her family have now publicly criticised the decision and called on the pageant judges to be more transparent about their criteria . Mr Fennell continued: ‘In my mind she was absolutely beautiful in her short hair. 'She was different but if the judges didn't want short hair then say so. 'I wish I knew how these contests were judged where there are other factors that are unwritten that have to be considered'. He also criticised those who questioned his daughter’s claims that Jamaica’s contributions to the world are Usain Bolt and Bob Marley. He  said: ‘Of course it’s Bob Marley and Usain Bolt...the answers of the other contestants did not answer the question’. It's renowned for its swimwear round, stunning dresses and a seemingly never-ending array of beautiful women. However, last night's Miss Universe final in Miami got hotter than ever - after Miss Colombia, Paulina Vega, 22, was controversially crowned the winner of the beauty pageant. Instead of the usual cheering, the audience erupted into boos of  disapproval as favourite-to-win Miss Jamaica Kaci Fennell only made it to fifth place. Shortly after Miss Fennell, 22, left the stage in the 63rd annual contest, her name began trending on Twitter along with the hashtag #MissJamaicaShouldHaveWon. And the winner is: Miss Colombia Paulina Vega is crowned Miss universe . Robbed? Miss Jamaica's striking good looks and unmistakable poise have left Miss Universe pageant viewers saying the 22-year-old was robbed after being named fourth runner-up . Unlike Miss Vega, who looks every-inch the beauty queen, Miss Fennell gained a large following due to her striking beauty, confidence intelligence and unconventional style - wearing her hair in a Halle Berry-esque pixie cut instead of the traditional long pageant waves. Fans claim Miss Fennell was denied the title after she proudly called Usain Bolt, the world's fastest short-distance runner, and reggae-king Bob Marley her country's greatest contributions to the world. 'I don't have long tresses like everyone else, I'm just representing myself and that's what beauty pageants are all about,' said Fennell, who wore a long, red beaded evening gown. 'You don't have to look a certain way ... and I feel like I represent that.' Her non-traditional answers along with her pixie cut and Caribbean confidence, likely contributed to her not placing higher in the final, according to her fans. Too honest: Kaci Fennell called Bob Marley and Usain Bolt the greatest contributions her country has given the world--an unlikely answer in the minds of some, but others saw honesty in her answer that other contestants would be afraid to show . Booed in support: Fennell, at right in the national costume competition and in her evening wear at left, received a major compliment from the Florida audience when they booed her being named fourth runner-up . Winning competitor Miss Vega is from Barranquilla, Colombia and is studying business administration. She said that she isn't planning to enter any more Miss Universe beauty competitions as she's eager to return to her studies. The 22-year-old is the granddaughter of a legendary tenor, Gastón Vega. Earlier she said, 'It will be a dream come true to represent the woman of today. A woman that not only cares about being beautiful and being glamorous, but also cares about being a professional, intelligent, hard-working person.'

Sanchez, a Nevada resident, has a fourth-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and has traveled the country teaching others. She spoke about equipping women to defend themselves against crime. 'It's just something that's so prevalent in our society and why not empower women to take control of a dangerous situation into their own hand,' she said.

The Miami suburb of Doral, which is hosting the women during their stay, is also known as 'Doralzuela' for its many Venezuelan residents. Three of the last six Miss Universe titles have gone to Venezuela, where beauty pageants are big business. Explosive confrontations are nothing new for Israel and Lebanon, but the latest spat between the longtime foes is perhaps the first to have been caused by an alleged photo-bomb. A seemingly innocuous selfie at the Miss Universe pageant in Miami has sparked criticism in Lebanon because it featured a smiling Miss Lebanon alongside Miss Israel. The Israeli beauty queen, Doron Matalon, posted a picture of herself with colleagues from Japan, Slovenia and Lebanon on her Instagram account. The result? A formal Lebanese investigation into the scandal. Lebanese Tourism Minister Michel Pharon told The Associated Press that 'if there was bad intentions' from Saly Greige, measures could be taken against her. In her defense, Miss Lebanon says she was photo-bombed. Matalon said the joint photo was genuine and was saddened that Greige was under fire at home. 'I hope for change and I hope for peace between us, and even just for three weeks, just between me and her,' she told NBC News. 'We need to remember that we represent the country and the people, not the government and not the political issues.' Under fire from critics angered by her fraternizing with the enemy, Greige took to Facebook to defend herself. 'The truth behind the photo: Since the first day of my arrival to participate to Miss Universe, I was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with Miss Israel (that tried several times to have a photo with me),' she wrote. 'Suddenly Miss Israel jumped in, took a selfie, and put it on her social media.' In a statement, the Miss Universe Organization said 'it is unfortunate to know a photo of four smiling women from different parts of the world, working together at an event, could be misconstrued as anything other than what it is, a celebration of universal friendship.' Neither Miss Israel nor Miss Lebanon made it to the competition's final round .","Audience erupted into boos as Miss Colombia Paulina Vega, 22, was crowned Miss Universe in Miami yesterday .

Hashtag: Jarre  asked his followers to tweet and retweet with the hashtag, #AmericanAirlinesCHILLOUT . Jarre, a star, who creates short videos for the video-sharing website Vine, tweeted that he was about to be arrested at Miami Airport and asked  his followers to help him  on Tuesday. He tweeted: ‘Speedos are great on the beach but no one wants to see them dancing down the aisle at 30,000 feet.’ He then begged his 867,000 Twitter followers and his 7.5 million Vine followers to tweet and retweet with the hashtag, #AmericanAirlinesCHILLOUT, to make the hashtag a trending topic. Within hours, it was the top-trending topic in the United States. Yet, when he landed at Miami Airport over 11 police officers were there to greet him  and they took him to meet with FBI agents, who told him they were on the phone with Washington. He tweeted that he saw FBI agents printing out some of the tweets that he had asked his fans to send. ‘It was pretty funny to see,’ Jarre said. Explanation: The Vine star explained that he was trying to make the video whilst he was on the flight to Miami . The airline told ABC News that Jarre will not face any charges, despite police being called to the incident. He told ABC News that his ‘goal was not to scare anyone but make people laugh.’ And, there was no record of his detention with either the Miami-Dade Airport Police nor the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office at the airport.

Jarre's followers have made him so popular that he reportedly walked out on a $1 million ad deal this week, because he says he's done making videos for profit. A YouTube video shows Jarre going into his agency and turning down $1 million for a one-year contract with the 'world's biggest brand,' which was not named.

"More than 130 asylum seekers have been moved into a seaside hotel popular with pensioners for dining and entertainment nights, it was revealed today. They were transferred to the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent, after overcrowding at the three-star Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace, south London, where 600 have been crammed in. But Damian Collins MP, who represents Folkestone and Hythe, has tried to reassure local residents that the asylum seekers will not be around for long - after learning of what was happening yesterday.

Inside: It is not yet clear how much taxpayers will be paying for the rooms, but the hotel's website gives room rates for a two-week stay of £521 to £836 for one person, or £616 to £966 for two sharing . Location: The two-star hotel is situated in the seaside and port town of Folkestone in Kent (file picture) ‘Shepway District Council is working closely with partner agencies and Damian Collins MP to monitor the situation. ‘The . council is keen to keep the local community up-to-date and will share . information as and when it becomes available through both traditional . and social media channels and our website.’ It . is not yet clear how much taxpayers will be paying for the rooms, but . the hotel’s website gives room rates for a two-week stay of £521 to £836 . for one person, or £616 to £966 for two sharing. If . the Home Office were to opt for the £616 price for 130 people, they . would be booking 65 rooms at that price - totalling £40,040. But the . Government department has not yet confirmed what it is paying. A Home Office spokesman said today: ‘The UK has a proud history of offering sanctuary to those who need it. ‘We have made clear to our providers that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term measure and they must make alternative forms of accommodation available as a matter of urgency. ‘The Grand Burstin Hotel will be used for a maximum of two weeks and we have instructed providers to reduce the number staying there as soon as possible. ‘We are working closely with Shepway District Council, who will be kept fully informed.’ And the Refugee Council’s head of . advocacy Dr Lisa Doyle told MailOnline: ‘The real victims in this story . are the asylum seekers. ‘First . they were forced into dangerously overcrowded accommodation through no . fault of their own and now they’re being shuttled around and pushed from . pillar to post.

The . asylum seekers had been placed there, without licensed permission from . the local authority or consultation with residents, by one of the Home . Office’s privately run ‘housing providers’. This had reportedly block-booked the hotel for months at a cost to the taxpayer of £500,000. In 2011/12, the cost of Home Office accommodation provision for asylum-seekers was £150million. The Grand Burstin’s website also says guests can ‘enjoy an excellent day trip to Belgium or France’ and promises an ‘exquisite dining experience that you won’t forget’ at the in-house restaurant. The hotel has an average score of three out of five on TripAdvisor, after almost 2,000 reviews. It is owned by the Britannia Hotels group, which has 47 hotels to its name in Britain - and bought the Grand Burstin in 2004. A company spokesman refused to comment when contacted by MailOnline. In April of last year, Britannia Hotels was fined £160,000 at Canterbury Crown Court after diners at the hotel were exposed to the risk of inhaling asbestos dust during refurbishment work. The hotel was opened in 1984 on the site of the 1843 Royal Pavilion Hotel, which housed the likes of author Charles Dickens, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and members of the Rothschild family.","Asylum seekers transferred to Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent .

"An Iowa dentist acted legally in firing a long-time assistant because he - and his wife - viewed the married mother as a threat to their marriage, the all-male Iowa Supreme Court ruled Friday. The court ruled 7-0 bosses can sack employees they see as an 'irresistible attraction,' even if they have not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong. Appearing on CNN Friday night, assistant Melissa Nelson said the decision was deeply unfair. Fired: Melissa Nelson was so attractive, Iowa dentist James Knight fired her out of fear she'd make him want to stray from his marriage . Hello ladies: Despite Nelson being 21 years younger than him, married, and 'not interested in a relationship,' Knight believed it would be too hard not to start an affair with her . 'I don't think this is fair,' she said from her Iowa home by phone. 'I don't think this is right.' Such firings may be unfair, but they . are not unlawful discrimination under the Iowa Civil Rights Act because . they are motivated by feelings and emotions, and not gender, Justice . Edward Mansfield wrote. An attorney for Fort Dodge dentist James Knight said the decision, the first of its kind in Iowa, is a victory for family values because Knight fired Nelson in the interest of saving his marriage, not because she was a woman. But Nelson's attorney said Iowa's all-male high court, one of only a handful in the nation, failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace. Nelson insisted she was never interested in Knight romantically, regardless of his own feelings. 'Absolutely not,' she said. 'I'm happily married.' Content: Happily married with children Nelson said she saw Knight as a father figure and had 'absolutely' no interest in him romantically . Since Knight fired her she has worked as a waitress six nights a week. While her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he couldn't look at her without being aroused, Nelson said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices. Asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive, Nelson laughed at the question. 'I'm just an ordinary girl,' she said. 'Just an ordinary mom.' Also appearing via call-in, her attorney, Paige Fiedler, said it was unlikely they would seek an appeal because of the way the case was filed as only interpreting state law. 'These judges sent a message to Iowa women that they don't think men can be held responsible for their sexual desires and that Iowa women are the ones who have to monitor and control their bosses' sexual desires,' Fielder said.  'If they get out of hand, then the women can be legally fired for it.' Nelson, 32, worked for Knight for 10 years, and he considered her a stellar worker. But in the final months of her employment, he complained that her tight clothing was distracting, once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing, according to the opinion. He also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying, 'that's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' 'That's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' Knight and Nelson — both married with children — started exchanging text messages, mostly about personal matters, such as their families. Knight's wife, who also worked in the dental office, found out about the messages and demanded Nelson be fired. The Knights consulted with their pastor, who agreed that terminating Nelson was appropriate. Knight fired Nelson and gave her one month's severance. He later told Nelson's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her. Family man: Knight's wife, who also works in the dental office, demanded Nelson be fired when she discovered text messages . Ordinary mom: Nelson has been working as a waitress since she lost her dental job and is unsure of her future career path . Nelson was stunned because she viewed . the 53-year-old Knight as a father figure and had never been interested . in starting a relationship, Fiedler said. Nelson filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination, arguing she would not have been terminated if she was male. She did not allege sexual harassment because Knight's conduct may not have risen to that level and didn't particularly offend her, Fiedler said. 'The motives . behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so . to preserve his marriage. Knight argued Nelson was fired not because of her gender, but because her continued employment threatened his marriage. A district judge agreed, dismissing the case before trial, and the high court upheld that ruling. Mansfield noted that Knight had an all-female workforce and Nelson was replaced by a woman. He said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner's family. One such case from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a business owner's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage. In that case, the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct. Jurisprudence: Justice Edward Mansfield penned the Iowa Supreme Court's decision on Knight's dismissal of Melissa Nelson . Mansfield said allowing Nelson's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender. Knight's attorney, Stuart Cochrane, said the court got it right. The decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination; in this case, by allowing Knight to honor his wife's wishes to fire Nelson, he said. Knight is a very religious and moral individual, and he sincerely believed that firing Nelson would be best for all parties, he said. 'While there was really no fault on the part of Mrs. Nelson, it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman,' he said. 'The motives behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so to preserve his marriage. 'I don't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all. In my view, this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law.'","Assistant had worked for James Knight for 10 years .

"Cocky, bad guys may usually get the girl in the movies but the same isn't true in real life, according to new research. It showed that being humble is the key to marking yourself out as a good romantic partner while arrogance and egotism are turn-offs, it found. Humility in men was just as important to attracting women, as humility in women was to attracting men. Scroll down for video . New research shows arrogance and egos are turn-offs for men and women, with a humble nature seen as a key attraction for both of the sexes . The findings will give hope to men who feel more like Hugh Grant's bumbling character in Four Weddings and a Funeral than they do Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf Of Wall Street. Psychologists who carried out the research said that being humble means people can 'overcome desires for power and superiority' in a relationship and instead put the relationship itself first. This means it not only makes you an attractive bet, it also protects against 'wear and tear' within long-term relationships. 'These results support the idea that humility is important for both the formation and repair of romantic relationships,' said lead author Dr Daryl Van Tongeren, of Hope College in Michigan. 'Humility appears to be a personality trait that is desirable in romantic partners and useful for maintaining romantic relationships under strain.' The authors said humble people see their strengths and weaknesses accurately, accept criticism as easily as compliments and are likely to be helpful and generous. The findings will give hope to men who feel more like Hugh Grant's bumbling character in Four Weddings and a Funeral than they do Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf Of Wall Street . Previous evidence suggests people may judge humility to understand how they could expect to be treated by a potential partner or in a group, they added. The research, published in the Journal of Positive Psychology, involved three studies carried out by Dr Van Tongeren and colleagues. In the first study, 41 students created dating profiles and answered personality questions in the belief that others would see their results and they would look at other students' profiles. But instead, all participants were shown the same mock profile and personality scores for a fictional potential date who was agreeable, extraverted, conscientious, not neurotic, and open. The only difference was that in some cases, the person was scored as highly humble and in others as not humble. In the study by Hope College in Michigan, both men and women preferred the humble profile as a potential date to the profile that suggested arrogance . Both male and female participants gave significantly higher ratings to the humble person and were more likely to want them to see their own profile, give them their phone number and meet them. The second study, involving 133 students, was similar but varied the language used to describe a potential date in the profile, rather than using numbers to rate humility. For example, the humble profile stated 'other people say I'm smart, but I don't like the attention', while the other read 'I'm a really good student and pretty smart...I guess it just comes naturally.' Again, both men and women preferred the humble profile as a potential date to the profile that suggested arrogance. The final study involved questioning 416 participants in real life relationships, half of them long-distance relationships that are likely to be more stressful. Researchers also found that people who thought of their partner as humble were more likely to forgive them than people who thought their partner lacked humility . Questionnaires asked about their tendency to forgive, their feelings about a recent time when their romantic partner offended them and their partners' level of humility. Researchers found, as expected, that people were less forgiving if their partner lived far away. They also found that people who thought of their partner as humble were more likely to forgive them than people who thought their partner lacked humility. Participants who believed their partners to be very humble were equally likely to forgive them regardless of whether they lived close together or far apart. But people lacking humility were less likely to be forgiven by long-distance partners. The authors suggest humble people may 'quickly see their partner's point of view, express remorse and attempt to rebuild the relationship, whereas arrogant partners may stonewall, act defensively, deny wrongdoing, or blame the victim.'","New research shows arrogance and egos are turn-offs for men AND women .

"A teenage girl has launched a petition for Disney to make a plus-size princess in the wake of controversy over whether the company promotes an unrealistic feminine ideal. Jewel Moore, a high school junior from Farmville, Virginia, wrote on her Change.org page that since Disney has such a huge influence on young girls, it should create a princess with a curvy body to 'show support to a group of girls who are otherwise horrendously bullied by the media.' But while many have praised her for trying to put a stop to body shaming, others have questioned whether a 'plus-size' princess - rather than simply a normal-size one - is a step in the wrong direction. Fighting for a cause: Jewel Moore, a high school junior from Farmville, Virginia, who describes herself as 'plus-size', has launched a Change.org petition for Disney to create a plus-size princess . Body image: Citing the unrealistically skinny proportions of princesses like Ariel (left) and Jasmine (right), she says Disney should 'show support to a group of girls who are otherwise horrendously bullied by the media' Jewel's petition, which has amassed 861 signatures so far, bears the title: 'Every body is beautiful'. She writes that she created the page 'because I'm a plus-size young woman, and I know many plus-size girls and women who struggle with confidence and need a positive plus-size character in the media.' Citing research that 'a child's confidence correlates greatly with how much representation they have in the media,' she says a plus-size Disney princess would be a positive step towards body acceptance. Many commenters have agreed with Jewel, leaving comments on the Change.org page to express their opinion. Equality: Jewel's petition, which has amassed 861 signatures so far, bears the title: 'Every body is beautiful' Every body is beautiful: She wrote on the page: 'I'm a plus-size young woman, and I know many plus-size girls and women who struggle with confidence and need a positive plus-size character in the media' 'If young girls see that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, they can change how society views it,' wrote one supporter . Another said: 'Having dealt with being overweight my entire life, I think that it would be great for Disney to make a more realistic princess for young girls to look up to.' But some have taken issue with Jewel's emphasis on 'plus-size', asserting that the focus needs to be on having 'normal' princesses with realistic and healthy dimensions instead. Misguided? While many have supported her petition, some have taken issue with her emphasis on 'plus-size', saying the focus needs to be on having 'normal' princesses with realistic and healthy dimensions instead . One parent wrote on CafeMom.com: 'Why do princesses have to be either weirdly skinny or plus size? Are there any petitions for normal sized princesses?' 'If girls are THAT impressionable I wouldn't want them looking up to overweight princesses' The sentiment was shared by another mother, who said: 'Understandable. But at the same time do we want our daughters idolizing a plus sized princess either? 'If girls are THAT impressionable then I really wouldn't want them looking up to overweight princesses or idols.

"Disgraced: Dave Lee Travis leaves Southwark Crown Court in central London yesterday after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a young TV researcher . Dave Lee Travis is facing fresh accusations of sexually abusing a primary school pupil, just a day after he was found guilty of groping a woman behind the scenes of a television show. The alleged victim is understood to be preparing to bring a civil action against the former Top Of The Pops host, 69, claiming his abuse had caused her 'life-long consequences'. Her claim, dating back to the 1970s, is believed to be one of seven separate allegations against Travis that prosecutors chose not to pursue, but her lawyer says she is determined to take her case to the civil courts. Alan Collins of Slater & Gordon told the Daily Mirror: 'One of the victims we represent alleges extremely serious abuse by Travis when she was a child. 'She was particularly vulnerable at the time and the abuse has had lifelong consequences. 'She complained to the police and DLT denies the assault, but she wants this man's actions to be brought to light and for him to answer for them.' Travis has denied the allegation. He has also previously insisted to police that he 'didn't mess with young girls.' Details of the allegation emerged as a mother-of-two came forward with claims that Travis had groped her when she was just 18 years old. Jayne Bird, now 46, claimed the shamed broadcaster pressed her against his car and groped her breasts after he asked her to help him carry his bags. Ms Bird added her voice to calls that Travis be jailed after his conviction yesterday for indecently assaulting a young researcher in her early 20s on the Mrs Merton show in 1995. He was cleared of another charge and the jury could not make their mind up on a third, which was recorded as not guilty since it was the second time the facts had proved inconclusive. Ms Bird said she never went to police over her alleged encounter with Travis. She said she and some friends had caught up with the veteran DJ in a pub after he had performed in a pantomime in Catford, south east London. 'He kept watching me the whole time,' she told The Sun. 'Then he came up and asked me to help him with some bags.' She says she agreed and walked out with him to his car. 'Then he said, ""Can I have a hug?"" I kind of agreed. But he didn't hug me, he groped me. He grabbed me and pushed me against the car and kissed me and grabbed my breasts,' said Ms Bird. She told how she pushed Travis away and fended off his advances a second time. Nevertheless, she said, he tried to coax her into his car to go 'for a drive'. Scroll down for video . Ms Bird said she never thought of going to the police, but has come forward since his conviction to because she wants people to know the attack on a TV researcher was not a one-off. That victim has told how Travis groped her for a ‘weird sexual thrill’ when she was a young researcher on the Mrs Merton Show. She fled to her boss, BBC producer Peter Kessler, and told him: ‘Oh my God, Dave Lee Travis just grabbed my t**s.’ But the allegation was not pursued by the corporation. The woman has since become a successful entertainer in her own right, and admitted in court that she has spoken publicly about Travis’s wandering hands. She said she had added humour to make it ‘palatable for the audience’, and defended her choice, saying it was a ‘positive and healthy’ way for her to cope with the assault. Shamed: Travis is now facing fresh allegations that he molested a primary school age girl, and today another woman came forward to claim she had been groped by the former DJ when she was just 18 years old . Despite speaking publicly about the assault in the past, the woman has not waived her legal right to anonymity as a victim of sexual assault. Last night her agent said she did not wish to say anything. No official complaint was ever lodged at the corporation, which has come under fire for turning a blind eye to Jimmy Savile’s abuse of girls and boys on its premises. At the time of the assault, in January 1995, the victim was in her early 20s. Travis cornered her in a corridor and chastised her for smoking. He told her: ‘You shouldn’t be smoking – think about what it is doing to your poor little lungs.’ Travis then touched her ribcage before sliding his hands up to her breasts in a ‘squeezing grope’. She said the assault ‘felt like ages’ but lasted about ten to 15 seconds before she escaped his clutches. ‘It was the weirdest thing that had happened to me,’ said the woman, who gave evidence without a screen, in view of Travis in the dock. ‘One minute I am meeting this radio DJ and the next minute I am being sexually assaulted by him.’ Dave Lee Travis on The Mrs Merton show in 1995: It was behind the scenes of this appearance that Travis was found by a jury to have groped the breasts of young researcher, who is now a broadcaster herself . In his police interview, Travis accused the woman of ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ in a bid to boost her career. ‘It’s just good PR for her to have comments saying, “You know what? DLT groped her”,’ he told detectives. ‘I remember the days when people touched other people and you kick them in the b***s and say “don’t be silly”. You don’t take them to bloody court.’ The victim came forward during Travis’s first trial, but was too late to be added to the charges. Travis has always insisted he is an 'easy target' since the beginning of investigations into historic abuse by celebrities. Conceding in evidence that he was 'not an angel', he nevertheless denounced his accusers as fantasists who came forward to make money from the media.","Alleged victim's case was not pursued by public prosecutors .

"A tattooed lady and her boyfriend were turned away from a nightclub by bouncers because they had visible body art. Miki Lane, 23, and her partner Jason Barker, 24, were told they could not enter Club Amadeus in Northallerton because they had tattoos on their arms. The pair were told by security staff that it was club policy not to allow people with body art into the premises. Scroll down for video . Miki Lane from Thirsk, North Yorkshire said she was outraged when she was turned away from the club . Ms Lane, who has 23 tattoos said she want to dispel the old image that people who have body art are thugs . Ms Lane, who works in a tattoo shop, was wearing a sleeveless dress when she tried to get into the club with her personal trainer boyfriend. She told bouncers she would be willing to cover up by wearing her jacket, but they said this was not allowed as all jackets had to be placed in the cloakroom. Ms Lane, from Thirsk, claims that the club's bouncers were wrong to turn her and her boyfriend away from the club because of their tattoos. She claimed that her 23 tattoos are artistic and in no way offensive. She said: 'We had never experienced this discrimination anywhere previously and I had been in to Club Amadeus before and had my tattoos in show and there had never been a problem. 'I used to work in a nursing home, and even the elderly residents wouldn't bat an eyelid. 'We were smartly dressed and all we wanted to do was have a dance and a bit of fun. 'There is not one offensive tattoo on either of us, they are artistic. In the past I know tattoos have had negative connotations, but these days I would say more than half the people my age have them.' Ms Lane said she and her boyfriend had spent £30 on taxis to get to the North Yorkshire nightclub. Ms Lane added: ' When people see my tattoos the reaction is that they are interested in them. 'One in five people have tattoos, it's getting more socially acceptable, so it's wrong to stereotype people who have them as thugs.' She was turned away from Club Amadeus in Northallerton with her boyfriend Jason Barker, pictured . This comes as Starbucks has relaxed its tattoo restrictions about workers having body art at work. Now staff at the company can show their designs as long as they are deemed tasteful, and are not on their face or neck. The British Army has announced it will allow new recruits with visible tattoos on their hands or necks, overturning a previous ban. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'Tattoos have become more acceptable in society over the last decade and, in recent years, there has been an increasing number of personnel with tattoos on visible areas.' The club is owned by Northallerton businessman George Crow, who was unavailable for comment. An employee confirmed the club's policy that tattoos cannot be on show in the venue. He added: 'I believe it is the owner's preference.'","Miki Lane was turned away from a nightclub because she had visible tattoos .

"Men are more than twice as likely as women to be victims of trolling on Twitter, but are the ones most responsible for the bullying, it has been revealed. According to an analysis of more than 2million messages sent to celebrities, politicians and journalists - one in every 20 sent to prominent male figures was abusive compared to only one in 70 for females. Piers Morgan is hit by the most hate-filled messages, with 8.4 per cent of the tweets he receives including derogatory comments. Piers Morgan (left) is most targeted with trolls, with 8.4 per cent of the messages he receives being offensive, while 2.6 per cent sent to Ricky Gervais (right) were degrading . For comedian Ricky Gervais, 2.6 per cent of tweets are abusive, while former Apprentice contestant Katie Hopkins is the female figure most likely to be trolled. However, according to the figures published by The Sunday Times, popstars such as Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora and Olly Murs are treated politely when it came to communicating on the social media site. Female journalists including Susanna Reid, who presents ITV's Good Morning Britain, were the only group who faced more abuse than their male counterparts - with 5.22 per cent of their messages containing personal insults. But politicians such as Baroness Warsi, who resigned from the coalition earlier this month in opposition to the Government's approach to Gaza, has only received a sixth of the abuse experienced by the likes of John Prescott. One Direction member Niall Horan - who attracted 25,000 abusive messages out of a total of 12.6m - had to be excluded from the study because the results would have distorted the outcome. Former Apprentice contestant Katie Hopkins is the female celebrity targeted by the highest number of trolls . A separate study by Carl Miller, research director at the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media, found that women were more hostile to other women, while men are also likely to be offensive to someone of the same gender. Last year Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow campaigned for Twitter to introduce an 'abuse button' after Caroline Criado-Perez was trolled for suggesting that Jane Austen should be on the new £10 note. The study published by think thank Demos was conducted using software co-developed by researchers from Demos and also academics from the University of Sussex. Research Director for the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media (CASM) at Demos, Carl Miller, who co-authored the report said: 'Receiving criticism has long been part and parcel of being in the public eye. But Twitter is providing newer, more direct ways, for the public to hurl abuse at celebrities and prominent personalities. 'We found that not only are men more often the target of this abuse, but are also more likely to be the ones behind the attacks. 'Social media is now an important part of social life and researching it is vital to understand the world that we now live in. It allows us to gather more evidence about society and politics than ever before, spot emerging problems, and, above all help us know what to do about them. 'Politicians need to fully understand a problem before they can solve it: CASM is currently developing this field - social media science - to make it an ethical and effective part of decision-making.'","One in every 20 tweets sent to prominent male figures are abusive .

"Superfan: Mother-of-one Jayne Bailey, 47, has 20 tattoos dedicated to her favourite band - One Direction . She might be four times the average age of a typical One Direction fan, but that hasn't stopped 47-year-old Jayne Bailey from covering her body with 20 tattoos dedicated to the band. The mother-of-one, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, has been following One Direction since they were on the X Factor in 2010. And her obsession with the five teenage band members - Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson - has only increased. The former pub manager now has 20 One Direction tattoos across her arms and chest - and even a comedy moustache on her index finger. She has an identical replica of Harry Style's tattoo of two swallows on his chest and Louis Tomlinson's stag on her arm and has each member's date of birth and their signatures inked on to her body. Ms Bailey has spent £350 so far on the inkings and 10 hours under the needle but has vowed she still wants more. Her latest tattoo is dedicated to the boys' film 'This Is Us' released last month. Ms Bailey's 13-year-old daughter Aisling is also a One Direction fan and the pair have covered their home with One Direction posters. But Ms Bailey admits she sometimes does get criticism for her obsession with the band. Ms Bailey, who is 28-years-older than Harry Styles, said: 'I love the band. I think they're great, it's something me and my daughter can do together . 'People stare but I just get used to it. I've had abuse on Twitter - even from 13 and 14 year old girls. They say things like: ""They will think you're stupid, they'll hate you"". 'But I'm mature enough to know whether or not I want a tattoo. I had two before I got the 1D logo tattooed on my wrist.

'Some people look at me strangely but the people that know me, know that it's who I am. I'll be devastated if they break up, but I'm old enough to know what I'm getting myself into.' Ms Bailey got her first One Direction tattoo last April and her collection has grown from there. Her aim is to get more tattoos and turn her One Direction montage into a full sleeve. She said: 'I do want more but I'm a single mum, so often it's a choice between a tattoo and shopping - and we need to eat. 'I only watched the X Factor to support Liam because his parents drink in my local pub. Saving up: The 47-year-old admits she would like more One Direction themed tattoos but says she doesn't have enough money yet . Matching: Jayne Bailey, pictured left, has a stag and a bird tattoo similar to Louis Tomlinson's on her left arm . 'But I got hooked. When Liam came in for a drink over Christmas it made our year. He signed a hoody for my daughter and a £10 note for me. He turned my £10 note into a million pounds. I have it framed.' Ms Bailey has even joined her daughter camping outside venues to get tickets for concerts. She said: 'We camped outside the Civic Hall in Wolverhampton for a night and managed to get front row tickets so it was definitely worth it. 'Then we spent two nights in a tent for the tickets for the LG Arena in Birmingham. 'Aisling's dad used to drop us off and we'd put up the tent and be fine. We actually made some really good friends that way.'

"A Canadian artist had more than a dozen of priceless instruments smashed to pieces by US customs after officials ruled they posed an ‘ecological threat’. Virtuoso flutist Boujemaa Razgui only discovered that his instruments had been destroyed when his luggage never arrived at his final destination in Boston and he was told customs in New York had confiscated the flutes. US customs are refusing to apologise to Mr Razgui, claiming they were acting in the interests of American agriculture. Canadian artist Boujemaa Razgui has 13 hand crafted instruments destroyed without warning by US customs who are refusing to apologise for their actions . Mr Razgui’s luggage contained 13 rare hand-crafted instruments - 11 nay flutes and two kawalas – as well as dried bamboo to use when building more instruments. Mr Razgui, a Canadian national living in Boston, was travelling from Madrid to his home town via JFK Airport in New York. Upon arrival, he found that his bags were missing. When he returned to the airport the following day, staff in Boston said the bags had been searched at JFK and his ‘agricultural products’ destroyed. 'I’ve been doing this for 26 years – travelling with my instruments and material to make instruments – and nothing like this has ever happened,' the Moroccan-born musician told The Globe and Mail. Mr Razgui was travelling to Boston via JFK Airport (pictured) where his bags were searched and the flutes deemed 'agricultural products' and taken by customs . 'They never gave me an opportunity to explain. These instruments are priceless to me. I make them with my own hands and I can’t make a living without them,' he said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection have said they will not apologize for destroying the flutes without contacting Mr Razgui, claiming that the bamboo was fresh, not dried, and therefore posed a risk. ‘The fresh bamboo canes were seized and destroyed in accordance with established protocols to prevent the introduction of plant pathogens into the United States,’ an official said.","Artist Boujemaa Razgui had 13 rare instruments taken by US customs .

"Half of today’s 20-year-olds will never marry, striking research reveals. Instead, couples are increasingly choosing to cohabit without ever deciding to commit. A report published today using the latest data from the Office for National Statistics reveals a generational shift away from the institution of marriage, with youngsters far less likely ever to wed than their parents and grandparents. The research by the Marriage Foundation shows that, for a variety of reasons, 47 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men aged 20 will never marry. Half of today's 20-year-olds will never marry, new data suggests. Instead they will cohabit without ever deciding to fully commit . The baby boomer generation – born between the end of the Second World War and the early 1960s – has maintained a healthy level of marriage, with 87 per cent of men and 92 per cent of women having married at some stage. But subsequent generations are facing a sharp decline in marriage rates. Half of 40-year-olds today are already married, but they are not expected to reach the levels set by their parents. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'One of the starkest findings of this report is that young people’s aspiration to marry so outstrips achievement. 'We should respond by asking what stops them from doing so - looking at how we can remove any barriers that currently stand in their way, and ensuring they have the opportunity to realise their aspirations. 'This government has already funded marriage preparation and relationship education for over 6,000 couples, but there is undoubtedly more to do. 'I firmly believe in the importance of strong families as the foundation of a healthy society, and that marriage has a powerful role to play in securing the relationship that lies at their heart. 'We know that stable loving families offer children the best possible start in life, so it is right that this government has taken steps to ensure families have the help and support they need to flourish. 'From action to reduce the couple penalty left by Labour to the provision of relationship education and the recognition of marriage in the tax system, it is clear that we are unashamedly pro-family.' 47 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men aged 20 will never marry for a variety of reasons, data shows . According to current trends, only 61 per cent of men and 68 per cent of women aged 40 today will ever marry. However, the greatest decline in marriage has taken place among those in their twenties. In 1970, the peak year for marriage, 564,818 men and women aged 25 got married. In 2010, just 56,598 did, a fall of 90 per cent. Today, only 5 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women aged 25 are married, as compared to 60 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women 44 years ago. When current trends are applied to today’s 20-year olds, figures show that only 52 per cent of those men and 53 per cent of women are expected ever to marry, despite strong aspirations to do so. Researchers blamed a number of factors, including early cohabitation, which makes people less likely ever to tie the knot, celebrity divorces, and decades of undermining of the institution of marriage by the state. Harry Benson, research director for the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘What we’re seeing is the devastating trickle-down effect of the trend away from marriage. ‘At the moment, we have high proportions of parents and grandparents who have got married at some stage and for the most part stayed together. 'They provide role models for the next generation. They also show what can be gained from making a marriage work in terms of the stability it provides for a family. ‘However, fewer of today’s 40-year-olds will be in a position to demonstrate the positives of a stable household cemented by marriage. ‘Their children’s generation, currently in their twenties, will suffer twofold; first from a higher level of family breakdown when they themselves are young, and secondly from the lack of familiarity with the benefits of marriage as they look to start their own families.’ Mr Benson said that the argument for marriage is ‘not a moral or religious one, but based on concrete facts’. ‘Cohabiting couples account for only 19 per cent of parents but 50 per cent of family breakdown. Among parents who stay together until their children reach 15, a tiny 7 per cent are cohabiting couples,’ he said. In its 13 years in power Labour was accused of undermining marriage, and the UK is almost alone in Europe in failing to recognise traditional family structures in the tax system. In last week’s Queen’s Speech, the Government confirmed its intention to restore a recognition of marriage in the tax system. Married couples where one partner pays no income tax will be able to transfer £1,000 of their tax allowance between them, saving them £200 a year. The Marriage Foundation was founded by Sir Paul Coleridge, a High Court Judge, moved by his personal experience in 40 years as a barrister and judge specialising in family law. Theresa May yesterday put the brakes on a feminist campaign to reform ‘sexist’ marriage certificates. Officials working for the Home Secretary said that changing the documents, used by thousands of register offices and churches, would be ‘complex and costly’ and that no modernisation is imminent. It followed reports yesterday that Lib Dem Equalities Minister Jenny Willott was preparing to push through a change to the certificates – which demand that the bride and groom record the names of their fathers but not their mothers. The campaign to add mothers’ names has been gathering pace, helped by an online petition which has reached 35,000 signatures. Green MP Caroline Lucas and Tory MP Chloe Smith both backed a Commons motion which said: ‘Our law should not perpetuate the offensive and outdated message that marriage is a business transaction between fathers ... change is needed so that mothers are no longer erased from important historical records’.","Sharp decline in young people getting married, ONS data suggests .

"'Chilling' evidence pointing to the manslaughter of Chloe Valentine has led prosecutors to appeal for her killers' to serve longer sentences, a court has been told. The four-year-old died from massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard in January 2012. The mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months. Chloe Valentine died at the age of four after being forced to ride a motorbike, by her parents, that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard in January 2012 . They both pleaded guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. Director of Public Prosecutions Adam Kimber SC on Thursday urged the Court of Criminal Appeal to find the sentences were 'manifestly inadequate' and 'shocked the public conscience'. The terrified 17kg girl was repeatedly placed on a 50kg motorbike in the backyard, which fell on top of her as she crashed into a shed and pot plants several times and eventually smashed into a lemon tree. She consequently suffered 39 injuries. Ashlee Polkinghorne, 22, was jailed for at least four years and nine months, while her then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months . Mr McPartland pictured with Chloe Valentine on a motorbike in the backyard of their Adelaide home . The terrified 17kg girl was repeatedly placed on the 50kg motorbike, despite crashing it several times . The injured child sustained black and swollen eyes, a cut to her head and bruises all over her body when ambulance officers arrived on the scene, the court heard. However the couple waited more than eight hours before calling an ambulance, during which they smoked cannabis and went on the internet seeking information about what to do when someone was unconscious. Mr Kimber said the sentences needed to deter both prisoners, who in future may have children or be involved with people who have them. The sentences also needed to deter other child minders from not getting help when something went wrong. The motorbike fell on top of Chloe as she crashed into a shed and pot plants several times and eventually smashed into a lemon tree. She consequently suffered 39 injuries . 'The child was but an infant, unable to resist getting onto the bike, unable to get herself medical care, unable to call an ambulance,' Mr Kimber said. Anthony Allen, for McPartland, said the non-parole period of 50 months in jail was 'hardly insignificant' and the sentence sat 'squarely' within the appropriate range. Polkinghorne was absent for the sentence appeal hearing and cited 'trauma' for not being in court, reported the ABC. Brian Deegan, for Polkinghorne, asked what greater deterrence could his client have than to lose her only child in tragic circumstances. 'It will be trite to suggest she will not have learnt personally an enormous lesson from this incident,' he said. 'There is no greater punishment than to lose her child.' He said no malice was involved in putting Chloe on the bike, adding 'this was supposed to be a happy episode'. McPartland received a maximum term of seven years while Polkinghorne received eight years. The three judges reserved their decision.

"As a carefree and impressionable teenager, Rudite Zalkalns was too naïve to spot the warning signs. After meeting Arnis Zalkalns by chance at a nightclub in Latvia, she was seduced by his chiselled looks and soon fell madly in love with him. Despite her mother’s concerns over his temper she agreed to marry him at the tender age of 19. Within three years, she was dead. Scroll down for video . Arnis Zalkalns (left) married Rudite when she was just 19. Three years later he murdered her. Her husband tricked her into going to a deserted forest with her, claiming they were on their way to pick up a new motorbike he had bought her. Once alone he bludgeoned her over the head with a scaffold pole before stabbing her through the chest. He then pushed her body into a grave he had already dug, covering her with soil and leaves. Arnis then toasted her murder by drinking a bottle of vodka as he stood over her shallow grave. Her mother Viktorija Zalkalns, 70, told the Mail that the seven-year sentence he served for the murder was disgracefully short. And she came close to tears when she learnt that he is the prime suspect in the Alice Gross case. Speaking from her modest apartment on the outskirts of Riga, she said: ‘I always feared he might kill again. ‘Once you have tasted blood the taste stays and you never stop. He killed our lovely daughter and destroyed our family. ‘I’m still angry at the length of his sentence. This was a callous and heartless murder with no remorse. My daughter was trained in karate but she couldn’t fight him off. ‘He prepared my daughter’s grave in advance and planted the weapons next to it. Then he tricked her into going with him to a forest.’ Arnis Zalkalns shot his wife in the stomach with a low-calibre gun after a row in 1996. She survived, but Arnis refused to pay for a surgeon to remove the bullet which had lodged next to her spine . Zalkalns, now 41, was raised in Riga and worked on building sites and dockyards from the age of 16. By the time he was an adult he had developed a penchant for chasing young, impressionable women. After meeting Rudite, a seamstress, he showered her with compliments and promises of a long and happy future together. When she fell pregnant the couple quickly decided to marry. At their low-key ceremony in Riga, in late 1994, she wore a maternity dress to disguise the fact she was seven months pregnant. In an unusual move, he decided that they should both use her maiden name of Zalkalns, rather than his surname Daksa as is traditional. ‘I didn’t like him from the beginning,’ Rudite’s mother said. ‘He was a control freak and had a fierce temper. But it was my daughter’s first boyfriend and she was so very much in love so what could I do?’ Viktorija Zalkalns, a former school caretaker, claims her son-in-law had affairs with other women in full view of Rudite. And after the birth of their daughter Elvira in February 1995 the relationship deteriorated further. Entries in Rudite’s diary show how depressed and fearful she had become of her husband. A year later he shot her in the stomach with a low-calibre gun after a row. She survived, but Arnis refused to pay for a surgeon to remove the bullet which had lodged next to her spine. Instead, the doctors simply stitched up the wound with the bullet still inside her. At first Rudite claimed that she had been shot by a member of a biker gang in a case of mistaken identity. And even when she told her mother the truth, she was too scared to report her husband to the police. A year later, in March 1997, he murdered her. She was just 22. Arnis Zalkalns is the prime suspect in the hunt for missing Alice Gross, 14, who was last seen on August 28 . In an attempt to cover up the crime he told friends and the police that his wife was missing. But he soon became the prime suspect after detectives found his wife’s diary in which she described her despair. In July that year Arnis confessed to her murder and showed police where he had buried her. He pleaded guilty in court the following year and was initially sentenced to 12 years, which was reduced to eight after an appeal. He served only seven. At court he claimed he murdered his wife because she had become a lesbian and was visiting gay nightclubs. He even claimed he saw her molest their young daughter. But Viktorija Zalkalns insists such claims are nonsense and were put forward by Arnis to reduce his sentence. Instead, she claims her daughter was killed because Rudite had discovered her husband had links to drug deals carried out by the Latvian mafia. After her daughter’s death, Viktorija brought up her granddaughter Elvira herself.

"Fashion chain Next has taken a baby grow off its shelves after customers noticed it was covered in penis drawings. Shane Gallivan, 23, was feeding his 10-month-old twin daughters Evelyn and Amelia at home in Bulwell, Nottingham, when he spotted an unusual shape in their baby grows' 'washing line' design. After looking closer, he uncovered what he believes is the drawing of a penis in the image of a green jumper. Error: Fashion chain Next has taken this baby grow off its shelves after customers noticed it was covered in penis drawings. It later admitted a drawing of a jumper had ended up looking like a penis because of a misprint . He then examined the rest of his daughters' baby grows and found lots of different penis images covering their arms, legs and bodies. Today, Mr Gallivan's wife Carla, 24, said her husband's discovery had left them feeling 'angry'. 'He was feeding my daughter when he suddenly said ""oh my god"",' said the insurance worker. 'He looked at the baby grow and noticed the trousers were covered in penises. 'At first I thought it must just be a mistake, but I looked and there are lots of different ones all over it. Unfortunate likeness: Shane Gallivan, 23, spotted the drawing of a penis in the image of a jumper (above) while he was feeding his twin baby daughters . 'It just looks like the designer was having a laugh and no one spotted it. I was angry because it's not the kind of thing you should be dressing a baby in.' Next, which stocks hundreds of baby clothes, later admitted the drawing of a jumper had ended up looking like a penis because of a misprint. Mr and Mrs Gallivan had been given a packet of the baby grows as a present four months ago, but had only recently noticed the design flaw. They are now refusing to dress their twin daughters in them. 'We aren't going to keep it and keep dressing the girls in it,' said Mrs Gallivan. 'I think what makes it all worse is that I have dressed two girls in it, not just that I put it on a baby. 'The girls were wearing it for weeks before we noticed. We don't tend to look in depth at the clothes. 'We just thought it was a cute, nice baby grow with washing line with clothes and socks on it, but then we saw this. Once you notice it, it is unmistakeable.' A spokesman for Next said the offending design was pulled from shelves after they received another complaint about the item. In a statement, the store said: 'We were shocked by the image that ended up on one of our sleepsuits. 'The offending part of the design started life as an upside down jumper with a neck binding and placket with buttons (hanging on the washing line), but unfortunately has been over simplified by the printer and has unintentionally become something else. 'This is an innocent mistake that had not been picked up in the approval process. As it was inappropriate we made the decision to withdraw this item from sale as soon as it was bought to our attention earlier this year.'","Shane Gallivan, 23, was feeding his twin daughters at home in Bulwell .

"The founder of a controversial Facebook group which invites people to post photographs of women eating on the London Underground said he is considering shutting it down due to the 'toxic hatred' he has received online. The Women Who Eat On Tubes group, which has more than 21,000 members, has sparked controversy with opponents claiming it encourages people to objectify and humiliate women who are unaware their picture is being taken. Film-maker Tony Burke, who set up the Facebook page in 2011, has insisted it was created as a 'human observation' that more women ate on the Tube than men and he had not intended to hurt anybody. Facebook confirmed the Women Who Eat On Tubes group was mistakenly taken down earlier today and was reinstated after the social networking site ruled it did not break its rules. The Facebook group allows commuters to post photos of women eating on the Tube without their knowledge . The group, which is titled Women Who Eat On Tubes, invites commuters to upload pictures of strangers caught eating in public . A British Transport Police spokesman said three people had contacted them about the Facebook group, including one woman who had her picture posted online. Mr Burke, 39, said he is now weighing up whether to shut down the page due to the 'constant barrage of toxic hatred' on social media. 'I'm considering taking the group down,' he said. 'I need to think about it carefully. I don't want to be seen to be backing down but I need to think about my family. The original Women Who Eat on Tubes group still currently appears if a user searches for it on the site . The page states its intention is to be 'observational, not judgemental', adding that it 'doesn't intimidate or bully' 'There are more important things to worry about.' Referring to Facebook mistakenly removing the group, Mr Burke said: 'I felt a sense of relief that this thing had reached a natural conclusion and I won't have to undergo the constant barrage of toxic hatred on social networks. 'It's affecting my family and loved ones who have been left in tears. 'It was set up because I was intrigued by the subject matter. It's human observation. 'What I do for a living is creative. I write stuff, I make films, I create stuff. 'This whole concept came from a really creative place. In its truest form it's just a creative group for a group of creative people.'I didn't set up the group to hurt anybody and I don't think I have done.' Mr Burke said he had changed the Facebook page to 'private' so only members can see the content posted after 'various people with not a lot else to do infiltrated' the group. Transport for London said while it is not illegal to take photographs of people on the Tube, if any of the women feel threatened, they should contact British Transport Police . Steve Burton, TfL's Director of Enforcement and On-Street Operations, said: 'If any customer has concerns about such behaviour, believing there may be a sinister motive, they are advised to speak to the police' The group had also been a 'healthy, positive thing' in the debate about privacy, he added. Today Facebook emphasised that under European law people can request to have their picture taken down if they feel it has infringed their privacy rights by reporting it through Facebook's Help Centre. But this will prove impossible if people cannot access the group. Mr Burke said he 'wished' he could also shut down a separate page with the same name on the website Tumblr but he had 'lost the login details'. A protest against the Women Who Eat On Tubes group in the form of a picnic on the Circle Line is due to go ahead on Monday, according to organisers writing on their Facebook page. A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'We are committed to tackling all forms of inappropriate behaviour on the rail and Tube network. Privacy campaign Big Brother Watch called for the law to be changed to deter people from taking secret photos in cases where they intend to publish them . 'We will work closely with complainants to challenge such behaviour and will seek to take the appropriate action in each case. 'To date one person has told us their picture is on the Facebook group, while two people have called to inform us of the group. 'If you notice anyone acting suspiciously on your journey, or if you have witnessed an incident, we want to hear from you as your information could assist officers and prevent a crime taking place.' Steve Burton, Transport for London's director of enforcement and on-street operations, said: 'Taking photos on the Tube isn't illegal, but we ask anyone doing so to ensure that they use common sense and respect for other passengers. 'If someone doesn't want their photo taken it is obviously inappropriate to do so. If any customer has concerns about such behaviour, believing there may be a sinister motive, they are advised to speak to our staff or the British Transport Police.'","Online forum set up in 2011 but it has provoked public fury in recent days .

"A man who was filmed battering his terrier after it had caught a rabbit has been banned from keeping animals for three years. Jon Soley, 33, from Darlington, Co. Durham, was seen on mobile phone footage shown to a court forcefully kicking his Patterdale terrier, Billy. Onlookers could be heard laughing and cheering as Soley repeatedly hit the small dog in the face with the dead rabbit. Kevin Campbell, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, told the court: 'He struck the dog and caused it to suffer. Anyone who treats a dog like that causes it to suffer.' Scroll down for video . Jon Soley, 33, from Darlington, was filmed repeatedly hitting his Patterdale terrier in the face with a dead rabbit . The dog, a family pet, can be seen cowering in the footage which was shown to Newton Aycliffe magistrates . Animal cruelty: Soley's solicitor agreed that the footage was disturbing but said he had kept dogs all his life . In mitigation, John Grierson said that while he agreed the footage was disturbing, his client had no previous convictions for animal cruelty and had kept dogs all his life. He told the court Soley had not sought treatment for his pet's mouth ulcer because it did not appear to be causing him any discomfort. 'Billy was a family pet - he went out for walks with the children in the family. He will regret the loss of the dog,' he said. Soley had denied a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to the dog, and another of failing to meet its needs by not seeking veterinary treatment for a mouth ulcer, but was found guilty at Newton Aycliffe magistrates' court. He also admitted two offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of possessing a cage trap and attempting to take a wild bird. As well as a three-year ban on keeping animals, Soley was given a 12-month community order with 80 hours of unpaid work. The court also heard that Soley, pictured above, had failed to seek treatment for the dog's mouth ulcer . The dog, which can be seen shrinking away as its owner approaches it, has been handed to the RSPCA . He must also pay court costs of £1,200, a £60 victim surcharge and vet fees of £360. Billy was signed over to the RSPCA and magistrates ordered the destruction of the mobile phone and bird cages. Soley was arrested during dawn raids in May last year as part of Operation Stockholm - a joint initiative by the RSPCA and Darlington police to tackle animal cruelty in the area. Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA chief inspector Mark Gent said he was pleased with the result and hoped it would act as a deterrent for others. He said: 'This is a prime example of where we have undertaken a joint operation focussing on things that have been put on the internet and brought those people to justice.'","Jon Soley, 33, was filmed on a mobile phone attacking his Patterdale terrier .

"A Brazilian student is set to sell her virginity for a staggering $780,000 after she put it up for auction online. A man called Natsu, from Japan, fended off strong competition from American bidders Jack Miller and Jack Right, and Indian big-spender Rudra Chatterjee, to secure a date with 20-year-old Catarina Migliorini. The auction closed this morning, and the physical education student - who said she will use the cash to build homes for poverty-stricken families - was the subject of 15 bids. Bare assets: Catarina Migliorini has auctioned her virginity for $780,000 to a Japanese bidder . Catarina's move sparked outrage across the globe, with many claiming she was little more than a prostitute. She also caused controversy when she revealed she would be followed every step of the way by an Australian crew for a documentary film called Virgins Wanted. But she said: 'I saw this as a business. I have the opportunity to travel, to be part of a movie and get a bonus with it. 'If you only do it once in your life . then you are not a prostitute, just like if you take one amazing . photograph it does not automatically make you a photographer. 'The . auction is just business, I'm a romantic girl at heart and believe in . love. But this will make a big difference to my area,'  she told Folha . newspaper. Catarina will be . 'delivered' to her buyer on board a plane between Australia and the U.S. - being interviewed before and after the sexual act. The intercourse itself will not be filmed . and Natsu will retain a right to be anonymous, without his picture . appearing in the media. Pure profit: Miss Migliorini denies being a prostitute on the basis she is only selling her body the one time . Sex toys will be banned from use and a condom will be compulsory, with Catarina saying she was prepared to prove to any sceptics that she has not had sex before. Natsu will be tested for sexually transmitted diseases prior to the encounter. A male virgin called Alexander, who is also being followed as part of director Justin Selsey's documentary, sold for $3,000 to a Brazilian woman called Nene B. Catarina previously said she wanted to plough the money - $20,000 and 90 per cent of the final auction sale price - into a non-governmental organisation which will construct modern houses in her southern home state of Santa Catarina. She signed up to the project two years ago when she saw an advert by Thomas Williams Productions looking for a virgin to film.","Student Catarina Migliorini makes deal with Japanese man named Natsu .

"It was supposed to be a meeting of the brightest young intellects. Sadly, some of those involved in a prestigious student debating competition were only interested in small-minded behaviour. They reduced two female speakers to tears with a barrage of sexist heckling. Students at Glasgow University made derogatory comments about the looks and chest sizes of Rebecca Meredith and Marlena Valles as they took part in the finals of the annual Glasgow Ancients debating championship. When one judge attempted to stop the heckling she was called a ‘frigid b***h’. Offensive comments continued during a party and ceilidh afterwards, it was claimed. Target: Rebecca Meredith was reduced to tears as she tried to make herself heard over the sexist heckles and intimidation during the debate at Glasgow University . Miss Meredith, a politics student at King’s College, Cambridge, and Miss Valles, a law undergraduate at Edinburgh University, had reached the finals of the annual tournament that sees teams from Britain’s oldest universities compete. But as they spoke to the motion ‘This house regrets the centralisation of religion’ on Saturday evening, they were repeatedly interrupted. Miss Meredith, 20, ranked among the top 20 speakers in the world, said that she was reduced to tears as she tried to make herself heard over the sexist heckles and intimidation. ‘The amazing Marlena Valles and I were openly booed by a small number of misogynistic male Glasgow Union debaters and members,’ she said. ‘Sexist comments were made about our appearance.’ One man yelled ‘Get that woman out my union,’ she said. ‘Our speeches were interrupted by cries of “shame woman” and boos at mention of female equality.’ When she and her debating partner complained, they were told it was ‘to be expected’ that female speakers would be booed. Kitty Parker-Brooks, a judge at the competition, was abused as she tried to quieten the hecklers. She said: ‘I was sitting behind the boys from Glasgow Union and could hear them making audible derogatory comments about the speakers’ appearances – their hair, dresses, chest size, how attractive they were – physically picking them apart, as well as yelling “shame woman” and booing. Marlena Valles (pictured) and Miss Meredith had reached the finals . of the annual tournament that sees teams from Britain’s oldest . universities compete . ‘I shushed them – and one then called me a “frigid b***h”. I stood up and made a speech in the floor debate calling them out on their behaviour, saying they had acted absolutely atrociously.’ Miss Valles said on Facebook she was shocked and horrified. She wrote: ‘It is difficult to speak confidently to an audience that is booing you for the sole reason that you are a woman in a dress talking about women’s rights, especially when you are the only girls in the final. I had six separate members of the Glasgow University Union approach me and give the exact same apologist speech – “I’m sorry they did that but they aren’t bad guys and it’s just how it is here and how they are. They are only joking”.’ Students at Glasgow University (pictured) made derogatory comments about the looks and chest sizes of Rebecca Meredith and Marlena Valles . Cambridge University’s debating club, the Cambridge Union Society, yesterday voted unanimously to end its reciprocal membership with the GUU and says it will not send students to debate there again. GUU president David Lockhart said last night: ‘We would like to offer a full and unreserved apology. We will be contacting the individuals concerned to apologise personally. Displays of behaviour that are misogynistic or sexist are entirely incompatible with our values.’ The GUU did not admit women until 1980 and continues to host an annual men-only meal. Former debaters include the late Donald Dewar, the late Labour leader John Smith, Sir Menzies Campbell and Charles Kennedy.","Students at Glasgow University made derogatory comments during debate .

"Clutching their preserve jars, Tupperware boxes and cloth shopping bags, Berliners can now buy their groceries package-free, in a 'precycling' first for the environmentally switched-on city. From ground Colombian coffee, to olive oil from Greece, biscuit wrappers and ready-made meal trays, the layers of packaging that consumers usually have to get through - and dispose of - are a thing of the past at 'Original Unverpackt' (Originally Unpackaged). A pair of German women fed up with a packaging 'overdose' founded the store, which opened its doors in the cosmopolitan Kreuzberg district last week. 'Original Unverpackt' is Berlin's first packaging-free supermarket, and is a 'precycling' initiative . The Kreuzberg district store was set up by two German women, Milena Glimbovski, 24, and Sara Wolf, 31 . Shoppers bring their own containers and can take as much or as little as they like of each food and drink. A customer pours pasta into a jar (left) and a barrel of red wine lies ready to be slowly emptied (right) A row of different types of beans at the store, which not only eliminates packaging but also reduces food waste . 'It was important to act and to be part of the solution instead of just getting worked up about the predicted end of the world,' one of the co-founders Milena Glimbovski, 24, said. Shoppers can buy the likes of muesli, rice and pasta by directly helping themselves from the large store containers, filling their own boxes before getting them weighed at the  till. For beer and red wine, it's the same thing -'bring-your-own' bottles are just fine, while vodka is even stored in a big demijohn from which customers can buy a few shots, or more. When customers are done, they bring their containers of food up to the tills to be weighed . The forward-thinking shop has a very 'old school' feel, but is very much a progressive initiative . An assortment of jams and spreads at the store, which has gone down well with Berlin locals . The store also sells washing up liquid and toiletries in bulk, with shoppers helping themselves to  shampoo using the tap on a 10-litre (2.6-gallon) tin, while toothpaste comes in tablet form. The shop's lay-out and decor make you almost expect an old-fashioned storekeeper in a striped apron and with a pencil behind his ear to appear. But its mission is all about forward thinking, by encouraging 'precycling', a preventive form of environmentalism, as opposed to just recycling already used packaging, Sara Wolf, 31, the other co-founder, said. Shampoo comes in huge vats, which can then be siphoned into smaller containers by customers . Toothpaste is even bought in tablets, so that there is none wasted and no packaging to throw away . Germans throw away an average of 16 million tonnes of rubbish a year, the Federal Environment Agency says . Germans throw away 16 million tonnes on average of rubbish a year, according to the Federal Environment Agency. Three-quarters of the rubbish found in the ocean is made up of plastic bags and packaging, as well as cigarette lighters and toothbrushes, and takes up to 400 years to disintegrate,  environmental group WWF says. Customers seemed taken with the Berlin store. 'Our society worries far too little about the problem of plastics,' complained Kathrin Puzia, a shopper in her 40s, who said she planned to get her groceries at the new shop 'from time to time'. Another customer, Lisa Specht, said she's been buying organic aubergines out of concern for the environment but questioned the benefit when they were still packaged. By bringing their own containers for their spices, customers stop packaging, which can take up to 400 years to disintegrate, from pouring into our seas and oceans . There are just a few packaging-free shops in Europe, including two in Italy, one in France and one in Vienna . 'Each one was wrapped in plastic film. Where's the ecological gain?' she asked. While jumbo size is often the order of the day at big supermarkets, with shoppers' trolleys full to brimming, Original Unverpackt allows customers to buy far smaller quantities to avoid waste. Valentin Thurn, a writer and director, who made the 2010 German documentary 'Taste the Waste', said the food industry played on consumers' feelings to get them to buy. 'Seventy percent of our purchases are spontaneous decisions where the packaging's importance is going to have something reassuring or exciting, for example, to push us to buy,' he said at the shop's launch. The package-free Berlin shop is among a handful in Europe, but the trend is still in its infancy, with two in Italy, one in Bordeaux in south west France and one in the Austrian capital, Vienna. It currently seems difficult to imagine big supermarkets following suit. Marie Delaperierre, who opened Germany's first no-packaging shop in the northern city of Kiel at the start of the year, believes the key is to simply meet local people's daily needs. 'This concept must remain a small neighbourhood shop to fulfil daily needs, such as ""I need 150 grammes of maize to make some popcorn"",' she said.","'Original Unverpackt' (Originally Unpackaged) set up by two German women .

"Companies should be able to ask their employees about whether they hope to have children, Sheryl Sandberg, one of the most senior women in Silicon Valley, said. Ms Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, said that women are held back at work . by stereotypes firms are unwilling to talk about. She said employees faced both open and covert  discrimination, as well as a lack of flexibility. The 43-year-old mother-of-two called for a much . more open dialogue about gender, which included discussing with . female employees whether they plan to have children, The Telegraph reported her as saying. Achiever: Sandberg urges women not to stop prioritising their career . 'Every HR department tells you not to do that … but we need to have a much more open conversation,' she said. Ms Sandberg, who earned US$30.87m . (£19.5m) from Facebook in 2011 was speaking to business leaders at the . World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, at a . session on how boost women’s role in economic decision making. Ms Sandberg at one point asked men in the session to raise their hands if they had ever been asked whether they should be working, given that they have children. None put their hands up, in contrast to the several women who did when the same question was asked of them. U.S. law essentially prohibits employers from asking female job applicants if they are planning to have children in the future. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it illegal to discriminate in employment on the bases of race, color, sex, national origin, and religion, was amended in 1978 to include the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The federal law prohibits an employer from refusing to hire a pregnant woman because of her pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition. Under UK law, recruiters may not ask . female job candidates whether they have children or are planning to have . any. However anecdotally, it is thought that many avoid women of . child-bearing age and advise women who are not planning to have children . or who have had a family already to make this clear at interview to . increase their chances of getting a job offer. Ms Sandberg . cited a conversation she had had with her lawyer, who had told her not . to publish an article urging women to 'lean in' to their careers – as . opposed to pulling back from them – before starting a family. 'Then . I thought, he works for me ... If someone wants to sue me because I’m . talking about gender discrimination, go ahead,' she said. Stereotypes: messages about gender that hold women back in the workplace are reinforced from an early age, says Sandberg . Her book Lean In, which encourages women to get further in the workplace, is due out in March. Ms Sandberg also attacked gender stereotypes that she said were still stacked heavily against women. She highlighted T-shirts currently sold in the US, where a boys' version bears the words 'Smart Like Daddy', while the girls' version says 'Pretty like Mummy'.'I would love to say that was 1951, but it was last year,' she said. She said the attitudes enshrined in those slogans led to the paradox that as a woman becomes more successful, she becomes less popular, whereas when a man becomes more successful, he becomes more popular. She also said women received less . encouragement to excel at work, saying: 'Think of it like a marathon. Everyone’s cheering the men on. The messages for women are different: . are you sure you want to run, don’t you want to run, don’t you have kids . at home?' Guilt: Mums at the session were more likely than dads to have been asked whether they ought to be working given that they had children . Sandberg also criticized the fact that it is still assumed women will take on the majority of the caring responsibilities at home, even when both parents work. Unusually for Davos events, five of six speakers on the panel at the discussion were female. Only one in six delegates at the high-powered event are women, though organisers have been trying to redress the balance. Top 100 'strategic partner' companies that attend and which can send five delegates have been told they must include one women. Many, however, choose to send only four rather than include a female executive.","Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is a married mother of two who earned $30.9million in 2011 .

"Nurse Natalie Mortimer, 25, (pictured outside Aberdeen Sheriff Court in January) has been struck off after being jailed for fabricating sex abuse claims . A nurse has been struck off after being jailed for falsely accusing her grandfather of rape in a bid to claim his inheritance money. Natalie Mortimer, from Aberdeen, was disciplined at a one-day standards hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in London. The 25-year-old was jailed for 22 months at Aberdeen Sheriff Court in January after being convicted of wasting 175 hours of police time by fabricating claims that her grandfather Gordon Ritchie sexually abused her. Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard at the time how she had falsely accused her grandfather of raping her when she was a child so she could get her hands on inheritance money. She eventually admitted she had made up the sex attack claims - but only after her innocent grandfather had spent time in a police cell following the allegations. The false claims wasted dozens of hours of police time and cost taxpayers more than £3,000. At the time, sheriff Graeme Buchanan told her: ‘False allegations of rape and other sexual offences are very serious because they put doubts in the minds of jurors in genuine cases and they subject innocent people such as Mr Ritchie to a terrifying ordeal of suspicion and investigation by police. ‘What you did to Mr Ritchie was truly evil and despicable and there is only one appropriate sentence for this behaviour and that is imprisonment.’ During her sentencing, she showed no remorse as she left the court dock in handcuffs - smiling at her friends in the public gallery. Today, the NMC confirmed she had been struck off from her position as a staff nurse at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for the offence. Mortimer lived with her grandfather and grandmother until July 2011 when she packed her bags and moved to London. She later went to a police station in Chiswick on numerous occasions between August 2012 and March last year and lodged complaints with police about her grandfather. She claimed to have been raped by Mr Ritchie over two years when she was at primary school. When Mr Ritchie, who used to be a foster carer, was first contacted by police he was on holiday with Mortimer's 15-year-old half-sister. He had to cut short his holiday and was asked not to have any contact with children aged under 16. Mortimer was disciplined at a one-day standards hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council in London (above). The Council ruled that the staff nurse at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary should be struck off immediately . As part of the investigation, previous foster children were also questioned and inquiries had to be made with social services and the health service, the court heard. Over the course of many months, Mortimer spoke to numerous detectives and called Mr Ritchie her abuser and a paedophile. The court heard how officers had been made aware that she had lied only after Mortimer's mother, Susan Simpson, began to doubt her story. Representing the former Aberdeen Royal Infirmary staff nurse, solicitor Lynne Freeland said her client was aware she had 'torn lives apart' with her greedy, selfish and cruel actions.","Natalie Mortimer, 25, falsely told police her grandfather abused her as a child .

"Mr Punter wanted to claim disability benefits based on the injury to his left leg - but the DWP thought he wanted to claim for an earlier injury to his right foot . A man who had his leg amputated was falsely accused of fiddling disability benefit after officials read a file about the other, healthy limb. Robert Punter was hauled before a court by benefits officials who told him he was not disabled enough to claim the allowance even though his leg was due to be amputated. The mix up occurred because the 63-year-old former trucker, whose left leg was shattered in a boyhood shotgun accident, also suffered a serious toe injury in his right foot. He was prosecuted when officials found a letter in his medical file showing he had made a full recovery from that operation and accused him of lying about his condition. He is angry that he has been treated as a criminal, despite battling to overcome his disability and work for 47 years, often in excruciating pain. Robert, of Newton Abbot, Devon, spent months waiting for his case to be heard at Exeter Crown Court before it was thrown out in less than five minutes. He denied falsely claiming disability living allowance and Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, recorded not guilty verdicts after Miss Emily Pitts offered no evidence on behalf of the Department of Work and Pensions. The case was dropped after defence solicitor Miss Ann Bellchambers obtained a statement from Torbay Hospital consultant Patrick Loxdale, confirming that Mr Punter had always suffered from a disability which entitled him to benefit. After the case Mr Punter explained that the case arose from a simple misunderstanding. His claim for disability benefits was based on the long standing injury to his left leg, which had eventually led to the amputation. The Department of Work and Pensions . prosecuted him on the basis that he had claimed benefits in relation to . the injury to his right foot, which had been treated successfully and . healed. He said: . 'This whole business has been a nightmare. I have been taken to court . and accused of swinging the lead when the truth was the opposite. The DWP prosecuted him on the basis that he had claimed benefits in relation to the injury to his right foot, which had been treated successfully and healed . 'I suffered a very serious injury to my left leg in a shotgun accident when I was 12. At one stage it was touch and go whether I would survive. 'I never used it as an excuse not to work. I started in the old Leathercraft factory in Newton Abbot when I was 15 and then drove dumpers and tippers on building sites until I passed my HGV and became a lorry driver. 'I did that for 40 years until I suffered arthritis in my right foot which led eventually to me having an operation to fuse my toe. 'It was while I was in hospital I met someone from the Citizen’s Advice Bureau who told me I was entitled to disability allowance even though I was planning to go back to work. 'After I was called in for interview and told I would be prosecuted my wife took photos of my left leg and sent them to the DWP but it made no difference. 'At the same time as this case was going through the system I was in a lot of pain from the left leg and went back to hospital where Mr Loxdale told me I had degenerative bone disease and would need an amputation. 'It took months to persuade them that I . am disabled but in the end they only restored my benefit after my left . leg was amputated above the knee.' The . consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Torbay Hospital who wrote to Exeter . Crown Court about Robert Punter said the prosecution was 'barking mad'. Mr Punter's claim for disability benefits was based on the long standing injury to his left leg, which had eventually led to the amputation . The consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Torbay Hospital who amputated Mr Punter's leg said the prosecution was 'barking mad' Patrick Loxdale, who amputated the Mr Punter's lower left leg earlier this year, wrote a letter about his medical history to his solicitor. In it he said: 'Robert Punter suffered a devastating injury to his left leg at the age of 12 and was lucky not to lose his leg. 'When I first me I was amazed to hear that he'd held a job down as a tipper driver for many years up until the age of 63, with plans to continue working until retirement age of 65. 'It was quite clear to me that he was a highly stoical individual who had minimised very significant orthopaedic problems in his left leg. '...Clearly I don't have details of the prosecution case against Robert Punter but I can say without any shadow of doubt that this man coped with a very severe left leg injury from the age of 12 to 63, holding down a physicaly demanding job and , in my view, tolerating a great deal of pain and incapacity in the process. 'However, as someone who generally takes a relatively robust attitude to some patients' desires to claim benefits, I find the fact that Robert Punter is being pursued completely bizarre to the point of being barking mad. 'This, in my opinion, is a highly genuine man with an extremely significant orthopaedic problem who is actually an example of somebody who's got on with their life and held down a job under extremely difficult circumstances.' A Department of Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases.'In this case the defendant's health deteriorated as the case was being progressed. 'In light of his deteriorating health it was not in the public interest for this case to continue.' She said she could not comment on the consultant's remarks and said it was a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision to review the case in court and offer no evidence. She added: 'Our fraud investigators present the best evidence possible, however, ultimately it's for the CPS to decide whether a prosecution goes ahead for benefit fraud. 'If an overpayment is suspected then we will seek to recover that as a civil matter.'","Officials read file about a healed injury on Robert Punter's right foot .

"A man accused of killing his girlfriend's mother and stuffing her body in a suitcase at a luxury resort in Bali has told his attorney that he never confessed to the murder - as authorities have claimed. Chicago attorney Thomas Durkin said Tommy Schaefer told him by phone that he didn't confess to killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, whose beaten body was found in a case in a taxi outside the St. Regis Bali Resort in August. Her pregnant daughter, Heather Mack, 19, is also a suspect. Neither has been formally charged. Last Friday, Colonel Djoko Hari Utomo, the police chief in Bali's capital, Denpasar, said that Schaefer, 21, confessed to killing von Wiese-Mack during questioning. Scroll down for video . Denial: Tommy Shaefer, pictured left as he is taken in to custody in August, has denied confessing to the murder of his girlfriend's mother in Bali. Police chiefs last week claimed he had admitted to the crime . Young couple: Authorities had also claimed that his girlfriend, 19-year-old Heather Mack (pictured together), had admitted to helping his dispose of the body . 'He was hurt and offended by the victim's words in an argument with him. That is the motive for the murder,' Utomo told The Associated Press. He also said Mack, who is three months' pregnant, admitted during a separate interrogation that she helped Schaefer stuff her mother's body into a suitcase. Utomo said Schaefer and Mack were accompanied by their Indonesian and U.S. lawyers during the interrogations, but Durkin said he has not gone to Indonesia. Neither Utomo nor his spokesman responded to after-hours phone calls on Wednesday seeking comment. Attempts last week to reach the Indonesian lawyers were not successful. Mack's U.S. attorney, Michael Elkin, has maintained that Mack is innocent, but he didn't respond to emailed questions last week about the purported confessions. Murdered: Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured with her daughter Heather, was beaten to death last month . Dumped: Her body was found in a bloody suitcase left inside a taxi waiting outside their hotel . He released a statement on Monday thanking the police chief and his staff for their 'professionalism' while adding that he would not comment further while the investigation continues. Police say they have interviewed dozens of witnesses, including the taxi driver and hotel employees, and some had reported an argument among the three over who should pay for the rooms. Security camera video showed the victim having an argument with Schaefer in the hotel lobby. The young lovers, who both come from the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, were arrested asleep in each other's arms in a hotel near the Bali international airport, after allegedly attempting to get hotel staff to open her mother's safe deposit box so they could retrieve their passports. Police claim the young couple initially told them that they been taken captive at the St. Regis by an armed gang who killed Mrs Mack. They said they managed to escape the gang’s clutches and fled to the hotel in the Kuta area of Bali. Heather is two months pregnant with what is believed to be Schaefer's child. Indonesian authorities say if she is convicted, the child could grow up in prison with her mother. Due to this, the unborn baby has been granted a lawyer to look after his or her interests. Locked up: Heather Mack, pictured in police custody last month, is pregnant, her attorney has said . Von Wiese-Mack's body was found stuffed into a suitcase after a taxi driver became suspicious when the couple loaded the luggage into his car but did not return. Pathologists say she suffered asphyxiation, a broken neck and a broken nose and that she had probably been killed between 6.45am and 10am local time. During her autopsy, several defensive wounds were also discovered, suggesting Mrs. Mack,  had fought back while being attacked. Family and friends of von Wiese-Mack will remember her at a funeral service Saturday at St. Chrysostom's Episcopal Church in Chicago's lakefront Gold Coast neighborhood, according to an announcement on the church's website. Von Wiese-Mack was the widow of highly regarded jazz and classical composer James L. Mack, who died in 2006 at the age of 76. Von Wiese-Mack was a member of a century-old Chicago literary club called the Caxton Club. She had varied interests including Asian literature and Wagnerian opera, according to a May 2013 profile of her in the club's publication, Caxtonian.","Last week, authorities in Bali said that Tommy Schaefer had confessed to killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack during interrogation .

"Sorry: The family of Russell Joslin, a BBC journalist who killed himself after allegedly being harassed by a female colleague, has received an apology from the Corporation . The BBC has ‘apologised  unreservedly’ to the family of a radio presenter who committed suicide after claiming his bosses ignored complaints that he was being sexually harassed. Russell Joslin, 50, died in October after reporting to managers that a senior woman colleague had bullied him for five years. Mr Joslin, the son of a chief constable, believed he was sidelined after rejecting her advances and his family demanded an inquiry after his death. Yesterday, the corporation apologised to Mr Joslin’s family after a report found the way the BBC had dealt with the complaints was ‘not good enough’. It also reported criticism of the female colleague, who cannot be named for legal reasons, with others describing her as a ‘strong and dominating personality’, who ‘created an atmosphere of intimidation’. Referred to as ‘colleague A’, the woman is said to have been ‘very difficult to work with,’ with ‘managers scared to confront her’. Mr Joslin, who was a reporter at BBC Coventry and Warwickshire, died at a psychiatric hospital in Warwick, three days after he tried to kill himself by walking in front of a bus. He had been tormented by work-related stress and had only recently returned part-time to the station. He is believed to have received a series of phone messages from his female colleague branding him a ‘flake’ and a ‘loser’ after they argued during a meal out in 2007. He had allegedly walked out on her in a restaurant, leaving her to find her own way back to Coventry, where she was working at the time. Upset: Russell Joslin's father Peter, 78, pictured at his home in Kenilworth, has blamed Corporation bosses for failing to stop his son's death . According to reports, one of the . phone messages sent to Mr Joslin said: ‘Thanks for abandoning me. Don’t . ever, ever think of me as your mate again. 'Do what you have to at the BBC cause you are a loser on 27 grand a year. But don’t ever encroach on me or my talent.’ After bosses failed to act on his . complaints he was left ‘a shadow of his former self’, Mr Joslin’s family . said. Yesterday, they added that the BBC had ‘clearly let Russell . down’. ‘They could and should have done . more. All of their staff regardless of role should be treated equally . and have the same standards expected of them. 'Whilst we do not blame any individual . and nor should anyone involved in Russell’s care do so, tragically it . is possible that Russell might still be alive if the BBC system had . pro-actively handled his complaints with more competence, openness, and . humanity.’ Mr Joslin’s father Peter, a former . Warwickshire chief constable, previously said that after his son . rejected the advances of his colleague ‘life became very tough for him’. Case: Russell killed himself at St Michael's Hospital (pictured) having previously tried to walk in front of a bus . Yesterday a BBC spokesman said: ‘The . BBC extends our deepest sympathies to Russell’s family, friends and . colleagues. Russell was a respected and much loved member of the team at . Radio Coventry and Warwickshire and he is greatly missed. 'We would also like to thank the Joslin family for their participation in this investigation. ‘The BBC acknowledges that aspects of . the handling of Russell Joslin’s case were not good enough.

"The derogatory name has caused an outcry among millions of ambitious young and educated females who claim they have been thrown on the scrap heap (file photo) China has upset its young female population by labelling those who fail to marry by the time they are 30 as ‘left over woman’. The Communist government ordered its feminist All-China Women’s Federation to use the derogatory term in several stinging articles about the growing number of educated, professional, urban and single females aged 27-30 who have ‘failed’ to find a husband and are now  deemed ‘undesirable’. ‘Pretty girls do not need a lot of education to marry into a rich and powerful family. But girls with an average or ugly appearance will find it difficult,’ reads one article titled ‘Leftover Women Do Not Deserve Our Sympathy’. The derogatory name has been picked up by the state media and stuck, causing an outcry among millions of ambitious young and educated females who claim they have been thrown on the scrap heap - and who bemoan the low quality of suitors. The conservative country is going under rapid changes with more women shunning tradition to wed and raise a family early. But the government wants to shame them into marrying young to counter the growing and serious gender imbalance among the of 1.3 billion population. Selective abortions because of the one-child policy means far more males are born then females - 118 boys to 100 girls. The government is also worried hordes of unmarried men roaming the country could spark social havoc. Leta Hong-Fincher, an American academic studying at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said: ‘Since 2007, the state media has aggressively disseminated the left over term in surveys, and news reports, and columns, and cartoons and pictures, basically stigmatising educated women over the age of 27 or 30 who are still single.' Since the one child policy was introduced in 1979, there are now about 20 million more men under 30 than women under 30. And census figures show that around one in five women aged 25-29 is unmarried. The . proportion of unmarried males that age is over a third higher - but . Chinese men tend to ‘marry down’ both in terms of age and educational . attainment. More Chinese women are shunning the tradition of marrying young and having children. But the government wants to shame them into marrying young to counter the population's growing gender imbalance (file photo) Nine out of 10 men in China think women should get married before 27 . Sixty per cent say the ideal time is 25-27 . One per cent believe the best age for a woman to get married is 31-35 . ‘There is an opinion that A-quality guys will find B-quality women, B-quality guys will find C-quality women, and C-quality men will find D-quality women,’ Huang Yuanyuan, a confident and single 29-year-old who works in a Beijing radio station, told the BBC. ‘The people left are A-quality women and D-quality men,’ she said. But the Chinese Bridget Joneses are fighting back, demanding the government ban the ‘left over women term. The All-China Federation of Women has recently dropped the label and now refers to 'old' unmarried women - but the left over expression remains widely used elsewhere.","Millions of women say they have been thrown on the scrap heap .

"Jailed: Elizabeth Jones, 22, faces 16 months in prison after making 11 false rape claims since 2004 . A woman who cried rape was jailed yesterday after a court heard it was her eleventh false claim. Compulsive liar Elizabeth Jones, 22, was exposed when CCTV footage disproved her allegation against a man she ‘did not like any more’. She had made her first false rape claim in 2004 when she was just 13, Southampton Crown Court heard. Between 2005 and 2007 she made another eight allegations which police investigated and dismissed, although she was not prosecuted. In 2009 she was sentenced to a ten-month detention and training order for a similar offence. Jones’s latest victim was a boyfriend against whom she made the allegation after the pair had an argument. Police began an investigation after Jones, from Southampton, persuaded a friend to report she had been assaulted. She later went to the police station for a medical examination and repeated her allegation. The man was arrested and questioned for nine hours before being released without charge. Prosecutor Jennie Rickman said he denied rape and detectives later viewed CCTV covering part of the house in which Jones claimed to have been attacked. The video did not support her story that the man forced himself on her. Miss Rickman said: ‘There is a history of her making false allegations of this nature and this is the 11th incident. ‘Police had to take her allegation seriously and carried out an appropriate investigation. ‘She was later arrested and accepted she had lied about being raped. She said she did it because she did not like him.’ Jones admitted to attempting to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for 16 months. Judge Derwin Hope said the offence was . not only serious because of ‘the terrible emotional experience’ the man . she accused had to endure, but also because it struck at the heart of . the criminal justice system. In mitigation, Megan Topliss said Jones had . had a disturbed childhood and had been in care. Fabricated: Southampton Crown Court heard that her latest victim was accused because she did not like him . When confronted by police, Jones . immediately accepted she had lied and pleaded guilty at the earliest . opportunity, Miss Topliss said. Outside court, Detective Constable Tim . Blanche of Southampton’s Public Protection Department, who led the . investigation, said that Jones had a ‘complex life’. Of the case, he said: ‘There was intimate contact between the couple, but they didn’t live together.’ The pair had an argument and Jones . made the fabricated rape allegation. ‘The man was arrested and he gave a . statement. He had to live his life with people accusing him of being a . rapist,’ Detective Constable Blanche said. When the man heard Jones had been . jailed for 16 months ‘he was disappointed and felt that the time wasn’t . long enough after what she put him through’. Detective Constable Blanche added: ‘After the previous ten false allegations, Judge Hope felt that it was the final straw. ‘The evidence in the case was so . conclusive as the CCTV images were so clear. I imagine that with the . previous allegations the evidence hasn’t been there. ‘We take rape allegations very seriously and those that make false claims need to face the consequences. ‘False allegations completely . undermine the work that the police have done and make it harder for . genuine rape victims to come forward.’","Elizabeth Jones, 22, invented her first sex attack in 2004, when aged 13 .

"Restaurateur Gary Newborough had food critics raving about the pizzas at the VIP launch of his trendy new restaurant - until he confessed they were in fact frozen and bought from a local supermarket. Gary, 58, had promised a ‘taste of Italy’ and a ‘pizza with a real difference’ at the bash at La Pizzeria Ristorante in Manchester’s trendy Northern Quarter. Around 100 local foodies turned up at the first floor eaterie and were waxing lyrical over the free tasters including 'special' Pizza Pollo and Pizza Spinaci. Pizzas with a difference: Gary Newborough, 58, had promised a 'taste of Italy' and a 'pizza with a real difference' at his VIP bash to launch La Pizzeria Ristorante . But the penny dropped when a note was passed round later that night revealing the food was in fact Dr Oetker pizzas bought from the freezer from a nearby high street store for just £2.78 each. Bizarrely the restaurant will be now serving the frozen pizzas until September 7 in the laid-back restaurant kitchen. Two ‘chefs’ will prepare fresh salad and breadboards and then take the selected pizza out of its box and pop it in the oven. Punters can grab their restaurant-cooked supermarket pizzas with a soft drink and side salad for £4 as part of a lunch special. Gary, who runs the venue as well as the Market Restaurant downstairs, said: 'We wanted to try and do something a bit different and we thought serving up supermarket pizzas would be a good idea to get people talking.' People took to Twitter calling it the 'weirdest thing in the history of the Manchester food scene'. Restaurant manager Chris Alexander, right, with customer Glen Keogh, at the pizza restaurant in Manchester's trendy Northern Quarter . The VIP guests were raving over these pizzas from a local high street store - frozen but nicely dressed up by restaurateur Gary Newborough and his team . Gary added: 'We wanted to see if they could tell the difference between freshly cooked pizzas and frozen ones from stores. Evidently people didn’t know the difference and were taken in because they loved it so much. 'Unfortunately some people at the launch were a little cross when they found out we were serving frozen supermarket pizzas. 'But they weren’t complaining when it was free and they were going through 36 bottles of sparkling wine that I laid on. It was just a bit of fun and it didn’t cost anybody anything to try it. 'I just liked the idea of doing something that nobody has ever done before.' In Gary’s Market Restaurant downstairs, he prides himself on using the freshest Lancashire ingredients with dishes including the finest hung Lancashire beef and Bury black pudding. But with 33 years in the business, he has no regrets about duping critics into tucking into the bargain grub, at last week's bash. Back for more: guests loved the special 'taste of Italy' until they discovered the pizzas were in fact frozen. But they'll still be on the menu until September 7 . He said: 'I had no intention to deceive. The pizzas are called Ristorante and we had Dr Oetker signs on the walls - it’s just a bit of fun for a month and I think it’s bloody good value. 'Great value, great service and in great surroundings - with no horse meat in sight. What more could you want? 'These are the best frozen pizzas around and at least we know what’s in them. I see people carrying boxes of burgers into restaurants and in big letters they say ""contains only 30% beef"". Why does no-one ask what the rest is?' No complaints: the blackboard at the restaurant advertises 'unique deep bakery crust pizza with a base that is crispy on the outside, soft and light on the inside' Floor Manager Chris Alexander, 22, said: 'Cooking frozen pizza is harder than it looks. The bases need to be crispy and they need to be cooked right each time, so it can sometimes be a little tricky,' he said. 'In terms of service and value we can definitely compete with the restaurants around here. It doesn’t matter that the secret’s out, that would defeat the object. We want to show that you can’t tell the difference between the Dr Oetker Ristorante pizzas and proper restaurant meals. 'At the launch most people were complimentary about the taste but we had a few who were a little angry because they felt they had been victims of a prank.' Twitter contained mixed reaction when news of the restaurant was revealed. Emma Louise Madden said: 'This Dr Oetker La Pizzeria Ristorante stunt has to be the weirdest thing in the history of the Manchester food scene. Reading it all open-mouthed.' While Leo’s Fish Bar, a popular Manchester takeaway and cafe tweeted: 'All this talk of Dr Oetker - why didn’t we just serve McCains?'","Gary Newborough had promised VIP guests a ‘taste of Italy’ and a ‘pizza with a real difference'

"Roy Hodgson has come under fire for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia. The Liverpool star told the England manager that he was too fatigued to start the match in Tallinn after shouldering a heavy burden this season for both club and country. Hodgson then made Sterling's comments public ahead of the match, which England won 1-0 thanks to Wayne Rooney's second-half free-kick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Raheem  came to me complaining of tiredness . England manager Roy Hodgson was criticised for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 win over Estonia . Sterling did not make England's starting XI in Tallinn but came on as a second-half substitute . Sterling was replaced by his Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana in the starting line-up but came on as a second-half substitute. Sky Sports pundits and former Liverpool players Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher both criticised Hodgson for not keeping their conversation private. Redknapp said: 'I would never have dreamed of saying that [I'm too tired] to an England manager, but then I picked up a lot of injuries. 'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers would have been leaning on him, [saying] you need a break and this is an opportunity to get one. 'Why on earth did Hodgson say it though? Honesty is not the best policy. Why has Roy got into this? He could have said 'I want to freshen this up.' This wouldn't even be a conversation.' Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp said Hodgson should have kept the conversation with Sterling private . Jamie Carragher, also talking on Sky Sports, agreed that Hodgson should have used more discretion . Carragher agreed that discretion would have been a better idea: 'Me as a player, I would never give a manager a chance to leave me out. 'But keep it between yourselves, just come out and say Lallana played well last game and say Raheem needs a rest. But now we are having a debate on it. 'Hodgson could have been more careful, but I don't think Rodgers would have been involved.' Sterling, 19, came off the bench to win the 74th-minute free-kick that led to England skipper Rooney curled in for his 43rd international goal. Hodgson said after the game: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. Hodgson chats to Sterling during training on the eve of the match in Tallinn, which England won 1-0 . Sterling's Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana started in his place in the England midfield diamond . 'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said ''look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired''. 'So I said best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that. 'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything. 'It was a question of having two players, who both did pretty well against San Marino and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded, the other one is full of beans. 'We'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve. 'I think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they're 100 per cent when they aren't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity. I thought Lallana had a good game.'","Roy Hodgson revealed that Raheem Sterling had told him he was feeling fatigued prior to England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia .

"Women GPs who only work part-time after having children place a ‘tremendous burden’ on the NHS, according to a Tory MP. Anne McIntosh claims 70 per cent of medical students are female and will only work a few days a week once they qualify. She warned that the cost of training these doctors – just under £250,000 a head – ‘is going to put a huge burden on the health service’. Pressure: The growth in the number of female doctors has 'unintended consequences' because they get married and have children, health minister Anna Soubry said (file picture) The MP for Thirsk and Malton, North . Yorkshire, a qualified lawyer, was supported by health minister Anna . Soubry who agreed there would be ‘unintended consequences’. But senior female doctors said she was . making an ‘unfair accusation’ against thousands of women GPs doing an . ‘extremely demanding job’. The latest official figures from the . Royal College of Physicians puts the number of female medical students . at 56 per cent and in the next decade women are expected to outnumber . their male colleagues for the first time. The proportion of women entering the profession has increased by 50 per cent since 2001. Controversial: Health minister Anna Soubry (left) backed Tory MP Anne McIntosh (right) who warned that female doctors get married, have children and then want to work part-time . Mrs McIntosh was speaking during a House of Commons debate yesterday on the controversial NHS 111 helpline. 'Training what effectively might be two GPs working part-time obviously puts a tremendous burden on the health service' Tory MP Anne McIntosh . She recounted how she had called the . service for advice about her elderly father but had ‘hung up in sheer . frustration’ because she ‘wasn’t getting anywhere’. The MP said it was ‘particularly . poignant’ that her father – a retired GP who had ‘worked all hours’ – . could not see a doctor in his own hour of need. She went on to imply . that the shortage of GPs may partly be due to the high proportion of . women working part-time. Clash: David Cameron (left) and Ed Miliband (right) exchanged blows at Prime Minister's Questions over who was to blame for the chaos in accident and emergency departments . She said women doctors were . ‘well-educated and well-qualified but when they go into practice, many . marry and have children … and they then often want to work part-time. ‘Training what effectively might be two GPs working part-time obviously puts a tremendous burden on the health service.’ Anna Soubry said: ‘She makes an important point about the unintended consequences of the number of women training as doctors.’ The health minister was later forced to clarify her remarks and issued a statement saying she ‘fully supported women GPs’.","Health minister Anna Soubry warns of 'unintended consequences'

"A British mother is to pack up and leave her three children behind to make a whole new life with a violent US prisoner she met online. Jennifer Butler, 29, will leave the UK and travel to French Robertson Unit in Texas to marry Christopher Mosier, 23 and leave her three young children all younger than 10 with their father. The besotted woman will move in with Mosier when he is released on parole in September and denied she is making a mistake. 'Some people might think I'm bonkers for falling in love with a prisoner. And not everyone will agree with our relationship,' Butler said to The Sun. 'But Chris is a wonderful man. Sure, he made a few mistakes in the past, but everybody deserves a second chance.' Love: Jennifer Butler, 29, pictured right earlier this year, is flying 5,000 miles from the UK to French Robertson Unit in Texas to marry Christopher Mosier, 23, left, leaving her three young kids who are all younger than 10 . The single mother started writing to Mosier in July after she found his profile on the website, writeaprisoner.com, which unites would be pen-pals to inmates online. His honest profile revealed that he had been sentenced to 15 years in 2009 for burglary with deadly conduct and also had prior drug convictions. Butler's future husband also was a member of an armed gang, but she said that she felt an instant connection with him and was struck by his honesty. 'I felt sorry for him being locked up, nobody to talk to except other prisoners. Of course, I didn't condone his crimes. But he was still a human being, and deserved to have a friend,' Butler said to The Sun. 'I was really intrigued by his profile. It was different to the rest. Most of the guys were posing with their tops off. But his was articulate and he was open about his crime.' Leaving them behind: Butler, seen center in May, plans to move in with her lover when he is released on parole in September. Her children, pictured with her, will stay with their dad, from whom she split in 2010 . The love-struck couple began writing to each other three times a week but suddenly in June 2013, Butler stopped receiving letters. 'I felt really sad that I hadn't heard from him. That's when I realised my feelings for him ran a lot deeper. I no longer saw him as just a friend anymore,' Butler said to The Sun. 'Then a month later I received a letter from him. He told me that the prison had been on lockdown so he had not been able to get stamps to write to me,' the smitten mom said. 'I realized I was in love with him and that letter made me admit it to myself. I couldn't bear to lose him.' As their love-affair blossomed, Butler even got her three children - Tyler, 8, Tristan, 7 and Mia, 4, to write to Mosier too. The prisoner started to receive letters from the children with drawings for his cell that they had made. Butler said that she believes it is really important that her children come to know Mosier because she will spend the rest of her life with him. Eventually, Butler had saved enough money from her job as a part-time sales assistant to travel to Texas to see Mosier. Mothering from abroad: Jennifer Butler from Mildenhall, Suffolk, is leaving behind her kids Tyler, 8, Tristan, 7, and Mia, 4. The single mum started writing to a criminal in a US jail two years ago. She intends to leave them in the UK with family for a year while she goes and sets up a life for them before sending for them . Butler made her first visit to the prison in October, but sadly, Mosier had been involved in a fight with an inmate and had his visiting rights revoked. He had to speak to Butler through a glass screen. 'We weren't allowed to touch because he was a maximum security prisoner at the time,' said Butler to The Sun. 'We had a glass window between us and had to talk through a phone. When I saw him walking down the corridor I knew he was the man for me. We talked for four hours and it felt like I'd known him all my life.' Eventually, Butler's affair with her prison lover caused controversy with her family who began to worry for her children. 'I knew people wouldn't have a good thing to say because he is an inmate. If he was just a guy from America I'd met online it would be different,' Butler said. 'I've had people ask why I'm not worried for the safety of my children. That cut me deep. To think that because he's a criminal my children would be at risk hurt me. Chris is a brilliant man. He's not a dangerous criminal. He's learnt from his mistakes,' she said. Pen pals: The pair were exchanging letters every day and eventually she flew to Texas earlier this year to meet him, which is when this picture was taken. They fell in love and now hey are now engaged . Butler traveled to see Mosier in American twice in the space of four months and on her third visit in April, the two became engaged. Mosier used a piece of grey string to propose - wrapping it around her finger in the visitors room. Butler swears that she will not let her children fall out of her life, even while she lives in America. 'He held my hand and said how much I meant to him and he got emotional. He never usually does,' said Jennifer to The Sun. 'He then said he wanted to make me happy and asked me to marry him. I just broke down. I said of course I would.' Free to marry: The prisoner, Chris, is up for parole next year and Jennifer, pictured, plans to marry him on his release . 'Leaving my children is not an easy thing to decide to do. But I want to get everything ready for them in America before they move, too,' she said. 'I'm doing this for our future because I want us to be a family. I need to set up a life out there for us and I'll do whatever I can to get them over with us as soon as possible.' She added, 'I am devoted to my children but they deserve a happy mum too. This relationship will be for me but the life I build is going to be for all of us.' Butler claims her children are just as happy about her leaving as she is, but because they haven't met their future stepdad yet, she won't be sure until they do. 'My children are excited about eventually moving over there. As kids, they won't realize about me not being around until I'm actually gone. It's going to be hard saying goodbye, but I know I'll see them again soon,” she said. 'It's fine because they know I'm going over there to find us a house and to sort out their schooling. The main thing is that they're excited to get to meet Chris.' 'I know he did a terrible crime but he's a changed man. He's going to make a wonderful husband and a brilliant stepdad to my children.'","Jennifer Butler is leaving her three children in UK to marry American prisoner .

"Disturbing scenes showing four girls being dragged kicking and screaming on to a plane in Brisbane to be sent back to their Italian father caused outrage across Australia today. The sisters, aged between nine and 15, were ordered by a judge in Australia to be returned to their father in Italy, despite the children’s wishes to stay in Queensland with their mother. The girls’ mother, who was married to an Italian, had taken them to Australia from Italy for a holiday two years ago – and then kept them in the country. Scroll down for video . Kicking and screaming: A girl is dragged on to a plane in Brisbane after a judge in Australia ruled that she and her three sisters must return to their father in Italy . A bitter international fight ensued between the parents, resulting in an Australian judge ruling the sisters must be returned to their father. Despite staying in hiding, the girls were finally collected by Australian police and security officers last night and driven to Brisbane airport – where passengers stared in shock as the girls screamed and struggled to break away from their escorts. Up to a dozen federal officers in suits were present as the four sisters were dragged to an airport lounge to await boarding on an Emirates flight, but they were determined not to go without a fight. ‘Let me go, I want my mum, I want my mum,’ one of the younger girls – they cannot be identified because they are minors – cried as federal officers held onto her arms. All girls cried out to their escorts . to let them return to their home in Australia and complained the . officers were hurting their arms. But the police were determined the . girls would be sent home, one officer telling a girl: ‘Now, you’re going . to get back on the plane.’ Passengers stared at the scenes of the sisters struggling with police, many saying that the incident was ‘awful…terrible.’ 'Awful': One of the younger girls cried 'Let me go, I want my mum, I want my mum' as federal officers held on to their arms . Displaced: The girls, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, were brought to Australia from Italy for a holiday two years ago by their mother, who then kept them in the country . The . Courier Mail newspaper reported that it had learned the mother of the . girls clung in desperation to the rear of an Australian Federal Police . car as it drove away with three of the sisters from a house where they . had been staying. She collapsed in the road sobbing at the end of what was described as a day of unfathomable anxiety and stress. For weeks the girls, who have joint . Australian and Italian citizenship, had remained in hiding with their . great-grandmother after a court ordered they should be returned to their . father in Italy. Desperate: The girls' mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, clung to the rear of an Australian Federal Police car as it drove away with three of the sisters . A . close friend of the girls’ mother told the paper that the prospect of . being returned to Italy against their wishes had made the girls anxious . and withdrawn in recent days. ‘What do you expect from little kids being taken away from their mum?’ said the friend. ‘The whole thing is unfair.’ The father had insisted in court battles that the children should be returned to Italy under the provisions of the Hague Convention, an international treaty against child abduction. Justice Colin Forrest found in the Australian Family Court last year that while he did not absolutely accept ‘the truthfulness of all of the evidence deposed to by the father’, he was satisfied the father did not consent to the children’s relocation. As Australians expressed their anger and dismay on social media, leading radio commentator Neil Mitchell said on his morning show in Melbourne that sending the children back to Italy amid the distressing scenes was ‘cruel, unreasonable and absurd’. Referring to the children being dragged kicking and screaming to an aircraft to be sent home to a father they did not want to live with after their mother had collapsed in the street, he said all this was happening because of the law. ‘If you’re a parent, this is disturbing stuff,’ he said. ‘I don’t doubt the judge is correct under the law, but we are talking here about children – is there no room for common sense?’","Sisters, aged between nine and 15, had been in hiding .

"With his wealth, glamorous lifestyle and friends in high places, Jonathan Price probably seemed too good to be true. Unfortunately for the women who fell for his charms, that’s exactly  what he was. The serial conman posed as a rich ‘sugar daddy’ to trap a string of professional women and fleece them for tens of thousands of pounds. The penniless 41-year-old told his targets he was a multi-millionaire and even bragged of being friends with billionaire Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. 'Callous' behaviour: Jonathan Price (left and right) told his unsuspecting victims he was a multi-millionaire with offshore accounts and was suffering from terminal cancer, Teesside Crown Court was told . He also claimed to have served in the SAS and the Parachute Regiment and boasted of owning speedboats, luxury cars and overseas property. He used a dating website called sugardaddies.com to meet women, who were taken in by his apparently glamorous lifestyle and became his girlfriends. He now faces jail after pleading guilty to fraud totalling £180,000 – leaving three women and their parents without their life savings. Price, from Darlington, told his unsuspecting targets that he had vast sums of money in offshore accounts and was suffering from terminal cancer. The conman then wined and dined each girlfriend using the cash he got from his other victims. He even proposed to one, booking a £96,000 wedding at an exclusive hotel. Online: The conman met a string of women on sugardaddies.com (homepage pictured) then tricked them into parting with tens of thousands of pounds . So convincing was he that his victims persuaded their elderly parents to help him out when he claimed to have encountered cash flow problems, believing he was more than capable of paying back their loans. Teesside Crown Court heard that Price was really a penniless ‘serial’ fraudster who left a trail of victims traumatised and facing financial ruin. He has served four prison sentences and collected seven previous convictions for dishonesty from across the UK over the past two decades. Legal documents describe him as  ‘callous’ and say ‘deception is so deeply ingrained in his mind’ that he was planning his next con while still in jail for the last. Judge Michael Taylor said during the hearing: ‘He is as dishonest as the day is long. He is a conman first and foremost. ‘If he is hoping to pull the  wool over my eyes, he’s in the wrong courtroom.’ Victim: Davina Ward, left, who was told that Price, right, had a fortune in offshore accounts . Price’s barrister, Peter Sabiston, added: ‘He is unsure because of the lies he has told what is true and what is fantasy. He does seem to lead a life of fantasy.’ When online, Price pretended to be looking for the love of his life and ironically wrote that he needed a woman who was ‘honest and trustworthy’. His victims included Davina Ward, 32, who runs a florist business in Bournemouth, and Sarah Giles, 39, who worked as a manager at a gun retailer in London. His third victim, a high-flying executive in her 30s who cannot be named, became his wife and was pregnant with his child when he was arrested last May. Price produced fake bank account paperwork to convince his victims he had fortunes tucked away, providing sham security for loans he would ask them for. Each time his web of deceit appeared to be unravelling, he would disappear, claiming to be unwell or saying he had been involved in an accident. On one occasion after going missing, he posed as an old army mate and sent emails to one of the women saying Price was gravely ill with a brain tumour. 'Acquaintances': Jonathan Price boasted of being a friend of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky (pictured), an exiled critic of president Vladmir Putin, who was found dead last weekend . Abroad: One woman was spun what came to be a familiar yarn that Price was obscenely wealthy with funds in an offshore account in the Cayman Islands (file picture), but did not have long to live . Luxury living: While in the capital, Price was seeing a woman, having lunch in Harrods (pictured) in Knightsbridge, central London, and telling her tall tales about his vast wealth . During his three-year campaign of deceit, he claimed to live in Sandbanks in Dorset, which contains some of the most expensive houses in Britain, and made an offer on a £5million property. He also boasted of being a friend of Boris Berezovsky, the exiled critic of president Vladmir Putin. Mr Berezovsky was found dead at the weekend. Price extracted money from his girlfriends and their families by claiming to be having trouble freeing some of his fortune from overseas accounts. When he met Miss Ward in 2007, he claimed to have funds in an offshore account in the Cayman Islands, but said he did not have long to live. He claimed he was using money from Miss Ward and her parents for trips to London for medical treatment. On wheels: Price ran up huge debts on a woman's credit cards - hiring a Land Rover Discovery (file picture) and driving it to Monaco, and asking his lover to fly out to see him . The sugardaddies.com website used by Jonathan Price is just one of a growing number of novelty internet dating agencies. It aims to attract young women in search of a wealthy older man, promising: ‘You are one step away from finding your dream Sugar Daddy.’ It targets ‘aspiring models, actresses and businesswomen’ who are ‘struggling in the early part of their career’. The blurb reads: ‘Would you like to have a man be a provider for you? Do you just love to be taken care of and treated like a princess?’ It promises to connect these hopeful women to men who have ‘attained substantial success’ and are willing to ‘share the finer things in life’. Men and women signing up are asked to give only their email address and personal details such as height and hobbies. But as with other dating websites, there is little way of checking that people really are who they say they are. But while in the capital, he was seeing Miss Giles, having lunch in Harrods and telling her the same tall tales about his vast wealth. After ending his relationship with Miss Ward, he continued to see Miss Giles, racking up huge debts on her credit cards. He even hired a Land Rover Discovery and drove it to Monaco, asking his lover to fly out to see him. She declared herself bankrupt and was living like a pauper when he began seeing the third woman, who he then proposed to. He went shopping on Bond Street for an engagement ring and booked a £96,000 wedding at the exclusive Rockliffe Hall, near Darlington. In the end, he cancelled the couple’s extravagant wedding, leading his fiancee to believe it was because of his ill health, and they were married at Harrogate Register Office with just four guests. Again, Price began to ‘borrow’ money from the woman and her family, but was arrested when her parents became suspicious. He now awaits sentence for the fraud, the victims of which also included estate agents, car and boat dealers and a businessman.","Jonathan Price told his unsuspecting victims he was a multi-millionaire .

"The number of Britons living abroad has soared in the last decade to top 5million for the first time. Official data from the United Nations reveals where people born in the UK have chosen to settle, with a quarter emigrants jetting halfway around the world to live in Australia and four settling in San Marino. A league table of immigrants also shows the UK has the fifth highest number of foreigners of any country in the world. Official data from the United Nations reveals where the 5million Britons who have emigrated have chosen to settle . Cheap flights, more open borders and the need to find work in the wake of the financial crash mean more people live outside the country they were born in than ever before. Last year a total of 232million people, or 3.2 per cent of the world’s total population, had moved to live in another country. In 2000 the figure was only 175 million and just 154 million in 1990. The total number of Brits living abroad rose 23 per cent from 4.1million in 1990 to 5million 2013. Australia was the most popular destination, with 1.277million expats, well ahead of the US where 758,919 Britons live and Canada, home to 674,371. Spain remains the most popular European country to live in for Brits, followed by Ireland, Germany and Italy. The biggest increases in emigration from the UK were mostly to eastern Europe, including countries which have since joined the European Union. It includes a huge leap in the numbers in Slovakia, up from 34 to 4,276 in 13 years. There were also large rises in the numbers in Bulgaria (up 5,000 per cent), Romania (1,240 per cent), Czech Republic (1,170 per cent), Latvia (1,116 per cent), Hungary (1,019 per cent) and Poland (892 per cent). Europe remains the most popular destination region with 72 million international migrants in 2013, compared to 71 million in Asia, the UN said. Despite there being almost 200 countries in the world, half of all immigration takes place into just 10 countries – including the UK. While 5million Britons live abroad, there are almost 3million more immigrants living in the UK. The US was home to the most immigrants anywhere in the world, with 45.8 million people, followed by Russia (11 million), Germany (9.8million), Saudi Arabia (9.1 million) and United Arab Emirates (7.8 million). Despite being the country ranked 80th in the world by size, the UK was home to the joint fifth highest number of immigrants with 7.8 million, just head of France (7.4 million), Canada (7.3 million), Australia (6.5 million); and Spain (6.5 million). The government has come under pressure to do more to tackle immigration. Rules have been tightened on access to benefits. In the latest crackdown, it emerged Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is planning to charge foreigners 150 per cent for their healthcare. The figures come from the UN’s Trends in International Migrant Stock report. Speaking at its launch, Wu Hongbo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, said: ‘Migration, when governed fairly, can make a very important contribution to social and economic development both in the countries of origin and in the countries of destination. ‘Migration broadens the opportunities available to individuals and is a crucial means of broadening access to resources and reducing poverty.’","United Nations report shows a record 232million people are living outside country where they were born worldwide .

"As the darkness set in last night, star gazers throughout the world looked up at the sky in the hopes of catching a glimpse the spectacular Perseid meteor shower. Despite patches of cloud cover and a bright supermoon, the shower provided some stunning views as it lit up the skies with streaks of up to 100 shooting stars per hour. The annual shower occurs every August and is caused by debris from the huge Swift-Tuttle comet falling into the Earth's atmosphere. The Perseid meteor shower is seen here over the village of Grafham in Cambridgeshire. It was taken in the early hours of this morning by photographer Matt Power . Matthew Power, a British photographer, was able to capture the first pictures of the Perseid meteor shower which reached a peak early this morning. Mr Power managed to get a good view of the display at Grafham in Cambridgeshire at about 2.30BST this morning. 'The conditions weren't great, but I'm absolutely thrilled I managed to see the meteor shower and get a picture,' Mr Power said. 'The moon was still very bright which made it hard.' Dr Bill Cooke from Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office has described Perseids is the undisputed 'fireball champion' of meteor showers. 'We see more fireballs from Swift-Tuttle than any other parent comet,' he said. This stunning photograph shows the trail of the Swift-Tuttle comet over Kent.  Robert Canis was up photographing between the hours of 1am and 4am BST this morning taking 300 photos in a time lapse. The comet is seen on top left, with a blue trail which appeared at 2.54 BST with other star trails circling the North Star (top left) A multiple exposure picture taken in the early hours of August 12, shows the meteor shower from the mountains of the Sierra Norte de Madrid near Valle del Lozoya . This image was taken in Grafham, Cambridgeshire, in the early hours of this morning by Matt Power. 'The conditions weren't great, but I'm absolutely thrilled I managed to see the meteor shower and get a picture,' he said. 'The moon was still very bright which made it hard' Nasa tweeted this image on the 12 of August. The meteor from the shower was obvious despite the bright glare of the supermoon, which also lit up the sky . The Perseids, which peak during mid-August, are considered to be the best meteor shower of the year. With very fast and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave long 'wakes' of light and colour behind them as they streak through the Earth's atmosphere. The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers (50-100 meteors seen per hour) and occurs with warm summer nighttime weather, allowing sky watchers to easily view the shower. Perseids are also known for their fireballs. Fireballs are larger explosions of light and colour that can persist longer . Another image shows a meteor streak over the sky during the Perseid meteor shower at the Maculje archaeological site near Novi Travnik in central Bosnia on August 12, 2014. Meanwhile Photographer Robert Canis from Kent was up early photographing between the hours of 1am and 4am BST taking 300 photos in a time lapse . The result was an image that showed the comet, with a blue trail which appeared at 2.54am BST with other star trails circling the North Star caused by Earth's rotation. For those who missed the display last night, there is a chance to catch it again tonight in Britain, Europe or North America. Tony Markham, director of the Society for Popular Astronomy's (Spa) meteor section, urged skywatchers to stay optimistic. 'The Perseids are rich in bright meteors and so many Perseids will still be seen despite the moonlit sky background,' he said, writing on the SPA's website. 'You can minimise the effect of the moonlight by observing with your back to the moon - possibly viewing the Cassiopeia/Cepheus/Ursa Minor area. 'If possible, keep the moon hidden behind trees or a nearby building.' This image of the Persied shower was shared by Nasa on the 12 August.

"A British housewife has been chosen from millions to knit a new outfit for NASA's latest astronaut...Camilla the rubber chicken. Camilla has already flown on a Nasa T-38 training jet, traveled aboard a helium balloon to the stratosphere over Louisiana in the U.S. and visited the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia. Now on her latest mission, she’ll be braving space covered in a protective orange and white outfit knitted from plastic bags by Sue Drage, from Rugby, Warwickshire. Honour: Housewife Sue Drage is the first person from outside the US to be given the chance to knit a new outfit for Nasa's chicken astronaut Camilla . Pioneer: Camilla the rubber chicken is Nasa's latest astronaut.  Her aim is to engage more young people with the space programme . Sue, 63, has knitted with plastic, newspapers and cardboard for a hobby for years. But it wasn’t until she was contacted by her local radio station that she was asked to knit the spacesuit for Camilla. Camilla is being used by NASA as a way to connect youngsters with the space programme and science. To date, the chicken has more than has more than 20,000 followers of Twitter, Facebook and Google+. At work:  Sue Drage working on the orange and space suit which Camilla the rubber chicken will don on her next adventure . Taking shape:  Housewife Sue Drage with the space suit she is making for Nasa's latest astronaut Camilla . Sue said she was honoured and surprised to have been chosen to make a costume that would hopefully be seen by millions round the world. She said: “I got the call from NASA through my local radio station last Friday and now I’m just about finished making the suit, it should be done by Sunday. 'I didn’t even know who Camilla the chicken was - I thought she was a live chicken, I didn’t know she was rubber. 'I’ve had to buy a rubber chicken to make sure I get the sizes right, and I’ve used about 10 plastic bags so far in the suit. Intrepid:  Camilla has already flown in a NASA T-38 training jet, traveled onboard a helium balloon to the stratosphere and visited the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Russia . Guide:  Sue Drage's knitted space suit and a replica rubber chicken which she is using to gauge Camilla's dimensions . Surprise:  Sue Drage could not believe it when Nasa contacted her and asked her to knit a space suit for Camilla . 'I’m hoping it’ll provide some protection when she’s out there in space or wherever she goes. 'Just think when you see her, she’ll be wearing simple housewife Sue from Rugby’s outfit. 'I feel like a rocket scientist or something.” Sue, who lives with her husband Richard, began her intergalatic fashion journey after being called by BBC Coventry and Warickshire’s Vic Minett who had contacted NASA. Ms Minett said: 'I always wanted to be an astronaut when I was a kid and when we heard about Camilla the chicken and NASA we got Romeo on the show to talk about it and he mentioned she wore a knitted suit. 'We'd just done a knit-a-thon for charity so we knew lots of knitters and we had heard about Sue making outfits from recycled materials. 'We thought it'd be amazing to have one of our listeners knit a suit for Camilla. 'When we told Romeo he was over the moon and really excited about it, and in a way my dream of getting to space has come true.' Nasa’s Romeo Durscher, who is Camilla's official keeper, said Sue was the first person from outside the U.S. to have been given the honour of clothing the astronaut chicken. He said: 'We want to make Camilla almost like a real person, this will actually be the first time we have had an outfit done from outside the U.S. so this would be the most special. 'When Sue and I talked I asked her to add something from the UK to the suit so it’s a real reminder when people see it they will ask ‘so why is this NASA chicken wearing something from the UK?’ 'This means we can tell the story which really is beautiful that now we have all these friends in the UK help us make this outreach and educational tool even stronger.'","Sue Drage, 63, to knit orange and white costume for the popular hen ."
"A U.S.-born singer of northern Mexican 'banda' music has been shot to death at a restaurant in the border state of Sonora. State police in Sonora said Tomas Tovar Rascon was born in Phoenix, . Arizona, and was shot several times at the restaurant in Ciudad Obregon. Tovar Rascon, 33, was better known by his stage name, 'Tito Torbellino.' Tomar sang narco-corridos songs about the life and death of drug kingpins . His Facebook page said he was scheduled to perform at a concert in . Ciudad Obregon on Friday. A U.S. booking agent listed for Torbellino . confirmed his death. Police said two gunmen entered the restaurant Thursday and shot Tovar . Rascon at close range. He died on the way to a local hospital. Members of other musical groups have been murdered in Mexico in recent . years, usually groups that perform 'narcocorridos' that celebrate the . exploits of drug traffickers. But while some guns appear in Torbellino's music videos, his songs mainly focused on unrequited love, not drug gangs. Experts say drug capos sometimes target musicians because of their ties to rival groups, or sentimental involvements. In 2013, South Texas singer Jesus ""Chuy"" Quintanilla was found shot in . the head near Mission, Texas. Quintanilla was well known for his . ballads, including some about the exploits of Mexican drug cartels. Singer Tomas Eduardo Tovar, 33, was gunned down late Thursday while dining at a restaurant in Ciudad Obregon . Elijah Wald, author of the book, 'Narcocorrido: A Journey into the Music . of Drugs, Guns and Guerrillas,' noted previous victims have included . singers of a number of genres, not only narcocorridos. Getting entangled . with the girlfriend of a criminal, for example, could be dangerous. 'In that world, it's probably more dangerous to be singing romantic . songs than narcocorridos because it increases the chances that . somebody's girlfriend will suddenly decide that you're the cutest thing . ever,' he said. Wald said he didn't have any information on the motive in the . Torbellino's killing, but noted that the singer appears only recently to . have become successful. 'It's often just a matter of somebody sponsoring someone who isn't . paying them back or isn't being properly respectful once they make it,' Wald. 'You're in a world where's it's very, very easy to be in the wrong place . at the wrong time, or have the wrong friends or look sideway at the . wrong girl. The list of things you can do wrong once you're in that . world gets very large.'","Tomas Eduardo .

"A substitute teacher allegedly had sex with a football player student, 17, on her first day of school. Symone Greene, 22, is charged with first-degree sexual abuse of a minor in a significant relationship. The alleged incident happened on October 17 in a classroom at Options Public Charter School in Washington, DC, according to the warrant. Scroll down for video . Accused: This is Symone Greene, the teacher who allegedly had sex with a 17-year-old student on her first day of school . The teen, a football player, recorded Greene performing a sex act on him after a high school pep rally for the team, authorities say . The student told police he met her at the school and gave her his cell phone number, reports WTTG. He claims he later received a text message from Greene, who was teaching English, to which he asked her if she was 'kinky'. She allegedly responded, 'I don't tell, I show,' court documents state. The sex attack at the end of the school's pep rally - it allegedly occurred in Greene's classroom where the student recorded the oral sex,  without Greene's knowledge, according to the warrant. Greene then allegedly sent the teen a text message over the weekend asking him not to tell anyone because 'it is not right for a student and teacher to have a relationship.' Symone Greene, 22, was working at Options Public Charter School (pictured) in Northeast D.C. on Friday when she first met the victim, a 17-year-old football player, according to court documents . She also allegedly sent a clothed picture of herself to the student, reports WUSA. 'When school administrators learned of the incident Monday morning, we immediately contacted the Child and Family Services Agency, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the parent of the student,' Shannon Hodge, the school's executive director, said in a statement. Hodge said Greene was contracted through a company based in Delaware and had never worked at the school before. Greene was arrested and charged this week, according to the documents.","Symone Greene, 22, was working at Options Public Charter School in Northeast D.C.

"Former Chicago Bears general manager Jerry Angelo said NFL teams didn't discipline players in 'hundreds and hundreds' of domestic violence incidents during his 30-year career. 'I made a mistake,' Angelo told USA Today. 'I was human. I was part of it. I'm not proud of it.' Angelo was the Bears' general manager from 2001 to 2011. Former Chicago Bears general manager Jerry Angelo says he 'made a mistake' in being part of sweeping under the rug 'hundreds and hundreds' cases of domestic violence incidents during his 30 years in the NFL . He entered the league as a scout with Dallas in 1980, worked as a scout for the New York Giants from 1982 to 1986, and was Tampa Bay's director of player personnel for Tampa Bay from 1987 to 2001. 'We knew it was wrong,' said Angelo. 'For whatever reason, it just kind of got glossed over. I'm no psychiatrist, so I can't really get into what that part of it is.

Ex-Ravens running back Ray Rice (right) was released from the team after video surfaced showing him knocking out his then-fiancee with a punch . 'I'm just telling you how I was. I've got to look at myself first. And I was part of that, but I didn't stand alone.' The Bears on Thursday denied any knowledge of Angelo's claims. 'We were surprised by Jerry's comments and do not know what he is referring to,' the team said in the statement to USA Today. Angelo added to the newspaper: 'Short of killing somebody, there is absolutely nothing worse than abusing a child or a woman. Nothing. And I think everybody understands that now much, much better. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Wednesday met with the full body of team owners to discuss domestic violence and discipline for misbehavior . 'We'll be better for it. Everybody will be better. The players, the NFL, everybody.' On Wednesday, Commissioner Roger Goodell met with the full body of NFL owners for the first time since several missteps by the league involving personal conduct incidents. The agenda was filled with discussion of domestic violence and discipline for misbehavior. 'Our business is to win games,' Angelo said. 'We've got to win games, and the commissioner's job is to make sure the credibility of the National Football League is held in the highest esteem. But to start with that, you have to know who's representing the shield. 'We got our priorities a little out of order.' Two recent incidents have sparked a national debate about how domestic violence involving football players should be punished within the league.

"Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell will remain free while he appeals his corruption convictions, a federal court ruled Monday. 'I plan to spend time with my new granddaughter who was born this month, attend my sons' graduation ceremonies, and embrace family time with my daughters,' McDonnell said in a statement. His wife Maureen, meanwhile, is still set to be sentenced to prison next month. The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond said McDonnell's appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact that 'if decided in favor of the accused' is 'important enough' to warrant reversal or a new trial. Disgraced Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell will be allowed to remain free while his appeal winds it way through the US federal court system . The court also said McDonnell isn't a flight risk or a danger to others and that the appeal isn't just a delay tactic. It ordered that briefs in the case be filed by March 2 and set a May 12 hearing. McDonnell's two-year prison term was set to begin February 9 after a jury last year found McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, guilty of illegally accepting more than $165,000 in gifts including a Rolex watch, designer clothing, vacations and loans from wealthy vitamin entrepreneur Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his products. Williams testified under immunity as the prosecution's star witness in a case that exposed the details of the McDonnells' shaky finances and troubled marriage. McDonnell testified in his own defense during the six-week trial, acknowledging that he accepted Williams' largesse but did nothing for him in return other than extend routine political courtesies. He was convicted of 11 counts. The Republican's appeal is based on the definition of 'official action.' He argues - as he has all along - that he did not steer any state money toward Williams' company and did nothing for the firm he wouldn't have done for any other employer in the state. McDonnell was convicted last year of 11 counts of corruption - despite attempts to blame the bribery scandal on his wife . Maureen McDonnell, who was convicted in the same federal corruption investigation, faces sentencing on February 20 and has not been granted leave from prison pending her appeal . Prosecutors originally sought a sentence of more than 10 years for McDonnell, whose lawyers recommended three years of community service. McDonnell's attorneys asked the court to allow him to remain free on bail while he appeals, arguing that the appeal could take almost as long as the sentence itself and would raise substantial questions, including whether the government's interpretation of an 'official act' is correct. Federal prosecutors opposed the request, saying the appeal isn't strong and that McDonnell's claim that the judge defined an 'official act' too broadly isn't likely to result in a reversal of his convictions. Last week, the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board announced it would suspend McDonnell's law license beginning Thursday, citing his felony public corruption convictions. He was directed to appear before the disciplinary panel Feb. 20 to show cause why his license should not be further suspended or revoked. According to the bar, McDonnell's license also was administratively suspended for nonpayment of dues to the organization since October 15. Maureen McDonnell is scheduled to be sentenced February 20.

"Former Australia captain Richie Benaud, the voice of cricket for millions of television viewers, said he was being treated for skin cancer in his first public appearance in more than a year. The 84-year-old, who led Australia to three successive Ashes series victories in the 1950s and 1960s, said he was undergoing radiation therapy for cancers on his head. 'I'm coping with it very well, the doctors are pleased,' Benaud said at an event organised by broadcaster Channel Nine at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Richie Benaud (centre, talking to Mark Nicholas) revealed he is being treated for skin cancer . The 84-year-old poses alongside Shane Warne (left), Ian Healy, Brett Lee, Bill Lawry and Nicholas .

'I recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads. When I was a kid, we never ever wore a cap. I wish I had. You live and learn as you go along.' 'All sorts of creams for young people and even those who aren’t so young. I’ll give you one good reason — 84-year-olds don’t seem to mend as well as they used to.’ The occurrence of skin cancer in Australia is one of the highest in the world, as much as three times the rates in Britain, the United States and Canada, according to Cancer Council Australia. Benaud, recently inducted into the SCG media Hall of Honour, said he and wife Daphne have been walking for 40 minutes a day to aid his health. In October last year, Benaud was involved in a car accident and ended up in hospital with injuries including two fractured vertebrae. ‘Medical people do wonderful things these days,’ he said.

"Former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and his family broke down in tears Thursday as a jury read its decision that he and his wife did sell the influence of the office to a wealthy vitamin executive seeking legitimacy for his company's signature product. 'Gut wrenching sobs' rang out in the courtroom as verdicts on the 13 counts, most of them guilty, were read to the courtroom. As the once popular governor was found guilty on 11 counts, he wept with his face buried in his hands. His wife was found guilt on nine counts. Three of the couples' five children were also among those family members breaking down in the Richmond courtroom as they held hands and sobbed along with the chorus of guilty verdicts. After the fall: Jurors on Thursday decided former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and his wife did sell the influence of the office to a wealthy vitamin executive. McDonnell is seen here with his son, getting into a car just after he was found guilty . 'My trust remains in the Lord': The ex-governor, who claimed during the trial to have moved in with a priest,  gave reporters very little to the reporters who were mobbed outside the courtroom at the trial's conclusion . Peddling influence: Maureen McDonnell (seen here after the verdicts were read) was found guilty on nine charges on Thursday relating her and her husband's relationship with a vitamin company executive . The torrent of emotions in the courtroom even left two of the jurors, who'd just helped all but guarantee the once-proud governor and his wife will see prison time, in tears themselves. According to NBC News, the governor and his wife will face sentencing January 6. Once considered one of America's most popular governors and even vetted to be running mate to Mitt Romney in 2012, McDonnell now faces as much as 25 years in prison. The man with the money: Jonnie Wiliams bought the McDonnells lavish gifts in exchange for favors and then got himself off the legal hook by testifying against them with immunity . The couple left the courtroom separately and remained apart. Bob McDonnell left first and walked into a witness waiting room. A loudly weeping Maureen McDonnell came out later, hugging one of her daughters. She went into a separate waiting room. 'My trust remains in the Lord,' was about all the ex-governor told reporters who were mobbed outside the courtroom at the conclusion of the marathon trial. Religion had become a theme during the proceedings for Mr. McDonnell, who claimed that his marriage with Maureen had crumbled and he'd moved in with a priest. Attorney's for McDonnell vowed to appeal. 'This is a difficult and disappointing day for the commonwealth and its citizens. Public service frequently requires sacrifice and almost always requires financial sacrifice,' said Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. The jurors all declined to speak to reporters as they left the courthouse through a back door. 'I just want to go home,' said one unidentified juror. CEO Jonnie Williams, the prosecution's star witness, testified under immunity that he spent lavishly on the McDonnells only to secure their help promoting and obtaining state-backed research for Star's tobacco-derived anti-inflammatory, Anatabloc. Bob McDonnell testified he did nothing other than extend routine political courtesies to Williams. Maureen McDonnell did not testify. Williams' immunity deal bars his prosecution not only for his dealings with the McDonnells, but also for possible securities fraud violations that were investigated by a separate grand jury. McDonnell's attorney, Henry Asbill, said in closing arguments Friday that the unusually generous immunity deal was Williams' 'greatest con.' Prosecutor Michael Dry countered that because of the agreement, Williams had no reason to lie on the witness stand. Could have had it all: Once-popular McDonnell had the opportunity to plead guilty to just a single charge, which he passed up and was subsequently tried on 13 charges. On Thursday he was found guilty of all but two . Zoo: McDonnell was once one of the most beloved governors in America and his popularity helped to turn the trial into an all-out media spectacle as viewers clamored to know more about the fallen politician's shady dealings . Emotional: The McDonnell children, including daughter Rachel at right, were among the family members in tears as a chorus of guilty verdicts were read Thursday in a Richmond courtroom . Spencer told the jury that the testimony of a witness who is granted immunity must be more closely examined than testimony of other witnesses. The heightened scrutiny is required to determine whether the testimony of the immunized witness is 'affected by self-interest,' he said. The judge also walked the jury through the charges, including 'honest services fraud' and conspiracy to commit such an offense. He also said a corrupt agreement need not be stated explicitly by the conspirators and that it doesn't matter whether the defendant would have done favors absent a bribe. Spencer also told jurors — who heard from three character witnesses, two for Bob McDonnell and one for his wife — that 'evidence of good character alone may create a reasonable doubt as to a defendant's guilt.' The defense argued that the McDonnells' marriage was in such shambles that the couple could not have conspired because they were barely speaking. Maureen McDonnell's attorney said the first lady developed a 'crush' on Williams, who capitalized on her vulnerability and further poisoned her marriage. The McDonnells attended several events promoting Anatabloc and hosted an event at the governor's mansion that Star billed as a product launch. The former governor also arranged meetings for Williams with administration officials, although none resulted in action.

"Prosecutors urged jurors on Friday to focus on two questions at the corruption trial of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen: Why did a businessman give the couple more than $165,000 in gifts and loans, and why did the McDonnells accept? The answer, prosecutor David Harbach said in his closing argument, was a 'corrupt understanding.' The McDonnells needed money because they were badly in debt, and he said they were willing to undertake official acts to help former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams promote his tobacco-based supplement, Anatabloc. 'That is bribery. That is corruption ... the real thing,' Harbach said. Scroll down for video . In closing arguments, prosecutors argued that former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell accepted huge cash gifts because he was in a pile of debt . The McDonnells are charged in federal court in a 14-count indictment and could face decades in prison if convicted. They are being tried together, but have their own attorneys, who will give their closing arguments later Friday. Harbach said the only reason Williams did not get the state-backed research he wanted was because a McDonnell aide 'shut it down.' The 'polite no' did not come from McDonnell, he said. 'That's because he was on the Jonnie Williams gravy train, and he and Jonnie Williams had a deal: Do what you can when opportunities arise and I'll keep paying,' Harbach said. He said it doesn't matter that McDonnell failed to help Williams get a state grant for research studies. 'The corrupt deal is why he's guilty,' Harbach said. The five-week, soap opera-like trial aired the McDonnells' dirty laundry as family members and those in the former first couple's inner circle testified about their fights, crumbling marriage and financial troubles. McDonnell, once considered a possible running mate for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, calmly and confidently testified in his own defense, saying the couple did nothing illegal and extended courtesies to Williams like any other elected official would. McDonnell and wife and wife Maureen (right) can face decades in prison if convicted . Father and son: Bob McDonnell leaves his trial with his son Bobby (right) Harbach challenged the former governor's credibility, questioning McDonnell's assertion that he knew nothing about the first gifts Williams showered on the couple: an April 2011 shopping spree in New York City in which he spent nearly $20,000 on designer dresses and accessories for Maureen McDonnell to wear at her daughter's wedding. McDonnell denied knowing Williams had paid for such expensive dresses. The former governor wasn't on the shopping spree, but did sit next to Williams later that day at an event. 'Folks, how do you miss that?' Harbach said to the jury. 'You decide who to believe.' Williams, the prosecution's star witness, testified under immunity that he spent lavishly on the McDonnells only to secure their support for Anatabloc. One of the gifts was a $6,500 Rolex watch that Williams said the first lady asked him to buy. She gave it to her husband for Christmas. 'I shouldn't have had to buy things like that to get the help I needed,' Williams testified. He also spent $15,000 on catering for a McDonnell daughter's wedding and about $3,200 on golf outings for Bob McDonnell and his sons. Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell holds hands with her son Bobby as they arrive at the corruption trial on Thursday . Williams treated the McDonnells to a family vacation that included use of his Ferrari and issued three loans: $50,000 to Maureen McDonnell, which she used to pay credit cards bills and buy Star Scientific stock, and two checks totaling $70,000 to MoBo Realty, the money-losing Virginia Beach vacation rental house owned by Bob McDonnell and his sister. Prosecutors said a product launch event at the governor's mansion was outside the norm of usual courtesies. McDonnell took time to speak briefly, even though he was dealing with the aftermath of an earthquake and an approaching hurricane. 'Jonnie Williams was on cloud nine,' Harbach said. 'This is exactly what he wanted. This is exactly what he was paying for.' Prosecutors also have cited several instances of Maureen McDonnell, and to a lesser degree her husband, promoting Anatabloc at various events. Bob McDonnell's arrangement of a meeting between Williams and the state's top health official also was one of the 'official acts' prosecutors say benefited Williams. Maureen McDonnell, whose reputation took a beating from a parade of witnesses who talked about her frequent angry outbursts, anxiety and depression, did not testify. One former employee acknowledged telling investigators her old boss was 'a nutbag.'","Prosecutor David Harbarch argued the ex-governor and wife Maureen were willing to take gifts from a businessman because of a mountain of debt .

"An FBI agent testified Thursday that former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, spent many nights together in the governor's mansion - even though their lawyers claimed the couple were barely speaking to one another. The revelation about the McDonnells' cohabitation calls into question the defense team's central argument that the couple's failing marriage made a conspiracy between them implausible. The agent was the final witness jurors heard from in the McDonnells' public corruption trial. They will return Friday morning for closing arguments before beginning deliberations on 14 charges punishable by up to decades in prison and millions of dollars in fines. Scroll down for video . First couple: An FBI agent told the jury in Virginia that ex-Gov Bob McDonnell (left) and his wife, Maureen (right), spent most of their nights together in the governor's mansion . Father and son: Bob McDonnell (C) leaves his trial with his son Bobby (R) in Richmond, Virginia, Wednesday . Bob McDonnell spent more than four days on the witness stand proclaiming his innocence and describing how his marriage deteriorated as he climbed the political ladder, ultimately reaching the office once held by Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. The defense claims the marriage was so strained that the McDonnells could not have pulled off a criminal conspiracy. They are charged with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts, free vacations and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's supposed panacea, the tobacco-derived anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. Outside the courthouse in Richmond Thursday, Bob McDonnell told WVEC that he forgives Jonnie Williams. The former governor also said he is not concerned about the outcome of the trial. 'I’m 60-year-old, I’ve done a lot of living,' McDonnell said. 'I’ve got amazing faith in God and my family and the ability of the jury to find the truth.' Williams testified under immunity that he spent lavishly on the McDonnells only to get their help as he sought credibility for the product and state-backed research on its effectiveness. Maureen McDonnell's attorney said the first lady developed a 'crush' on Williams, but he testified they weren't even friends — that the relationship was strictly professional. The last witness was FBI agent Kathryn Weber, who analyzed the McDonnells' cellphone records and calendars and concluded that they spent 90 per cent of their nights together during the 22 months that were the focus of the investigation. The testimony was intended to undercut the marital discord theory promoted by the defense. Wandering eye: An attorney for Maureen McDonnell, left, pictured Thursday with her son, Bobby, center, said the former first lady had a 'crush' on entrepreneur Jonnie Williams . Growing apart: Bob McDonnell (center) testified that he got into the habit of working late to avoid going home and dealing with his Maureen's anger . Most of the nights together were in the governor's mansion, Weber testified, but some were on trips. Bob McDonnell's attorney, John Brownlee, challenged Weber's methodology and conclusions. He rattled off 20 occasions when McDonnell did not arrive at the governor's mansion until 11pm or later, implying that the couple couldn't have had much time together on those nights. Brownlee also pointed to several blank daily calendars for Maureen McDonnell, which the FBI agent counted as nights at the mansion. In response to the attorney's question, Weber said she was not aware that Maureen McDonnell sometimes spent the night at the couple's private home in suburban Richmond. Daughter speaks: The McDonnells' eldest daughter, Jeanine (right) testified that her parents’ marriage had been troubled for 20 years and her mother (left) developed 'a mild obsession' with businessman Jonnie Williams . Prosecutor Jessica Aber suggested that the few instances raised by Brownlee did not substantially alter the overall picture of how often the McDonnells were together. McDonnell had testified that he got into the habit of working late to avoid going home and dealing with his wife's anger, and that he and his wife are living apart during the trial. On Wednesday, the jury heard from the McDonnells' eldest daughter, Jeanine, who also testified that her parents’ marriage had been troubled for many years and her mom developed 'a mild obsession' with Jonnie Williams. Jeanine McDonnell said her parents rarely spoke to each other in private, going back decades. She said as far back as 20 years ago, her father was rarely home and her mother was left largely alone to raise the couple’s five kids. Jeanine McDonnell said she believed, even as a child, that her mother was depressed and that she took long baths and threw herself into soap operas to counter her loneliness. When the McDonnells were able to create family time, she said, Bob McDonnell devoted himself to his children, and his wife received lowest priority. It got worse as McDonnell’s career advanced from state delegate, to attorney general, to governor, and then in 2012 when he became a chief surrogate for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Still, Jeanine McDonnell said, her parents were adept at putting up a good front in public. 'Any time they went in a public setting, it was like a switch flipped and they turned it on,' she said.","The defense argued the couple's broken marriage made a criminal conspiracy implausible .

Scroll down for videos and animation . The relatively smooth landing region, identified for the moment simply by the letter 'J', is located on the smaller of the duck-shaped comet's two lobes. An inset showing a close up of the landing site is also shown . But they've warned that the landing should be seen as an 'exciting extra' on the Rosetta mission as the mission carries a 'high risk'. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is currently travelling through space some 273 million miles (440 million km) from Earth. The relatively smooth landing region, identified for the moment simply by the letter 'J', is located on the smaller of the duck-shaped comet's two lobes. A further back up site has been chosen on the larger of 67P's lobes, and is currently being marked by Esa with the letter 'C'. Close-up of Philae’s primary landing site J, which is located on the ‘head’ of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Site J offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites, and is also scientifically interesting, with signs of activity nearby . At Site J, the majority of slopes are less than 30º relative to the local vertical, reducing the chances of Philae toppling over during touchdown. Site J also appears to have relatively few boulders, and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge Philae and continue science operations when its battery runs out . The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to Comet 67P. The 220lb (100kg) lander will reach the surface on 11 November. It will take around seven hours to descend. During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made. Philae will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace, using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface. Once the lander touches down, it will make a 360° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed. The initial science phase will then begin, with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment, and the surface and subsurface temperature. The lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis. The interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards Rosetta. The announcement follows weeks of studying the comet, in the hopes of finding an ideal location to land the probe as minimal damage as possible. If successful, the 220lb (100kg) lander will reach the surface on 11 November, where it will perform in-depth measurements on the comet. 'As we have seen from recent close-up images, the comet is a beautiful but dramatic world – it is scientifically exciting, but its shape makes it operationally challenging,' says Stephan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager. 'None of the candidate landing sites met all of the operational criteria at the 100 per cent level, but Site J is clearly the best solution.' At Site J, the majority of slopes have an angle less than 30º, reducing the chances of Philae toppling over during touchdown. Site J also appears to have relatively few boulders, and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge Philae and continue science operations on the surface beyond the initial battery-powered phase. Site C was chosen as a backup because of more sunlight hours and fewer boulders. But even the flat surface chosen contains potentially dangerous boulders and cracks. The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km). The . reconstructed-colour image, taken about 10 days ago, indicates how dark . the comet appears. On the average, the comet's surface reflects about . four per cent of impinging visible light, making it as dark as coal . This 3D image of Philae’s primary landing site on the ‘head’ of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with red–green/blue filters . Site C was chosen as the backup site for Rosetta’s lander Philae during the Landing Site Selection  meeting held on 13–14 September 2014. The image was taken by Rosetta at a distance of about 43 miles (70km) If all goes to plan, Philae will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace, using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface. According to Esa, this is a 'one-shot opportunity' and real-time radio control will be impossible due to the incredible distance of the comet from Earth. The entire landing process is expected to take seven hours, and if successful, will represent a historic moment in space exploration. 'We will make the first ever in situ analysis of a comet at this site, giving us an unparalleled insight into the composition, structure and evolution of a comet,' says Jean-Pierre Bibring, a lead lander scientist. 'Site J in particular offers us the chance to analyse pristine material, characterise the properties of the nucleus, and study the processes that drive its activity.' Several different surface regions are shown in this map, which is oriented with the comet's 'body' in the foreground and the 'head' in the background. The map was used to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in November . The original five candidate landing sites for Rosetta’s lander Philae, and with the backup, Site C, indicated . The race to find the landing site could only begin once Rosetta arrived at the comet on 6 August, when the comet was seen close-up for the first time. Since then, the spacecraft has moved to within 18 miles (30km) of the comet, allowing more detailed scientific measurements of the candidate sites. 'There's no time to lose, but now that we're closer to the comet, continued science and mapping operations will help us improve the analysis of the primary and backup landing sites,' says ESA Rosetta flight director Andrea Accomazzo. 'Of course, we cannot predict the activity of the comet between now and landing, and on landing day itself. 'A sudden increase in activity could affect the position of Rosetta in its orbit at the moment of deployment and in turn the exact location where Philae will land, and that's what makes this a risky operation.' During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made. Zoom in on the image below to find out where Rosetta is at the moment . The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to 67P. If all goes to plan, Philae will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace . Rosetta took an incredible selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week. In the background is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct 'head' and 'body' clearly visible . Once the lander touches down, it will make a 360° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed. The initial science phase will then begin, with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment, and the surface and subsurface temperature. The lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis. The interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards Rosetta. 'No one has ever attempted to land on a comet before, so it is a real challenge,' says Fred Jansen, Esa Rosetta mission manager. 'The complicated 'double' structure of the comet has had a considerable impact on the overall risks related to landing, but they are risks worth taking to have the chance of making the first ever soft landing on a comet.' Comets are time capsules containing primitive material left over from the epoch when the sun and its planets formed. By studying the gas, dust and structure of the nucleus and organic materials associated with the comet, via both remote and in situ observations, the Rosetta mission should become the key to unlocking the history and evolution of our solar system.

"The UK’s largest supermarkets are charging customers up to 40 per cent more to purchase shopping in their convenience stores. An analysis of prices revealed that Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Tesco are putting significant premiums on the products sold in their smaller outlets. A sample basket at a Sainsbury’s Local cost 10.2 per cent more than at a larger store several hundred yards away. Shoppers said they were reluctant to buy lunch on-the-go or ingredients for dinner that day because at convenience stores because of their prices . A survey of 20,000 UK shoppers showed that although people buy from convenience stores and like that they are handy, they don't think their prices are fair . And the same goods at Waitrose were 7.8 per cent more expensive at one of their downsized branches. However Tesco had the biggest . differences in pricing between its ‘Express’ convenience stores and . larger supermarkets – with a difference of 11.2 per cent. A single orange at a Tesco Express shop cost 40 per cent more than at a superstore. A British Retail Consortium spokesman . said: ‘Where prices vary, it is due to the different overheads involved . in running different types of store.’ Retail consultancy Him! surveyed consumers about their grocery shops and convenience culture. Results revealed that UK shoppers are . increasingly doing 'top up' shops in supermarkets rather than . convenience shops, so that they can buy cheaper products. Of the 20,000 shoppers surveyed, 40 per cent said they don't think that the prices in convenience stores are fair. Katie Littler, insights director of . Him! told trade magazine The Grocer that the industry has to address how . shoppers feel about the disparity in prices between their branches. 'There are no excuses because shoppers don’t care about a store owner’s increased costs,' she said. 'Shoppers . are increasingly expecting prices in convenience to match supermarkets, . meaning they will be tougher judges of convenience stores. 'A . poor price perception continues to be the main barrier to UK adults . using convenience stores -limiting footfall, visit frequency and spend.' Shoppers said the price disparity was the main reason they are put-off buying lunch on-the-go or getting ingredients for meals-for-tonight. Him!’s Convenience Tracking Programme 2013 shows that although the amount spent per trip increased from . £5.63 in 2012 to £6.04 in 2013, basket size remained at 2.8 items and . visit frequency fell from 3.7 to 3.6 times a week. Special offers and bulk reductions that are available in large stores, are not always offered in the chain's smaller shope . Supermarket owners argue that the increased cost of rent and overheads in high street convenience stores is behind some of their price differences . An increase in top-up shopping . fuelled a surge of almost ten per cent in the number of convenience . stores owned by supermarkets last year. According to the survey, shoppers who use convenience stores know they charge more but do not think it is . fair. Although 71 per cent of those surveyed said they were happy to pay a . little bit more for convenience, 40 per cent said they did not think . convenience stores charged fair and reasonable prices. Trade magazine The Grocer said that supermarkets . make no secret of the fact that they charge more for products in their . convenience stores. The Grocer said Tesco and Sainsbury’s typically charge a few pence more but claim . it is difficult to give a like-for-like percentage comparison because . product sizes and promotions are different. Morrisons ‘M’ local also . charges more but claims it is less than rivals because of its unique . supply chain. The premium at Waitrose is around 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent. In addition the percentage of people who expected a £1 product in a convenience store to also cost £1 in a supermarket rose from 21 per cent in 2012 to 30 per cent in 2013. Research showed that shoppers find the most . ‘over-priced’ categories were household, fresh meat and fish, health and . beauty, fruit and veg, and tinned and packet grocery.","An orange at Tesco Express shop cost 40 per cent more than at superstore .

"Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has spoken out for the first time over her split from her husband of 19 years through her Twitter page. Pictured driving away from her home in Glasgow the 40-year-old, who created the Ultimo bra, announced she would be stepping away from the public gaze as she deals with her break up. She tweeted: 'Thanks for all ur support at this very difficult time. 'For the time being I'm taking a break from Twitter. Have a great New Year.' Brave face: Michelle Mone leaves her home in Glasgow after separating from her husband of 19 years. She thanked follower on Twitter for their support . Earlier this year, Michael Mone was said to be 'appalled' after his wife became the face of her company's racy advertising campaign. Mrs Mone founded MJM International with her husband in 1996, launching the first of her cleavage-enhancing Ultimo bras in 1999. After losing six stone, the mother-of-three recently began modelling her own range of lingerie, a move she said had left her husband so angry he had stopped talking to her. The multi-millionairess admitted: ‘He was appalled I’d posed in my underwear. He didn’t speak to me for days. It’s something we can’t talk about, even now.’ Rumours of marriage trouble circulated after Mrs Mone, from Glasgow, was pictured on the arm of EastEnders actor Shane Richie in April – and was then seen getting cosy with rugby player Gavin Henson at a pre-Wimbledon party in June. 'Amicable split': Michelle Mone and husband Michael, pictured together last summer in Glasgow, announced today that they have decided to separate after 19 years of marriage . Mrs Mone, X Factor vocal coach Yvie Burnett, and Carol Vorderman enjoyed an evening at 34 Restaurant in Mayfair, London, earlier this month . Confidence: The entrepreneur candidly revealed that her husband struggled to deal with the confidence her six-stone weight loss gave her . She had met both men during the . filming of the ITV show 71 Degrees North. She denied allegations that . they were anything more than friends. In . October, multi-millionaire Mrs Mone admitted in an interview that the . trappings of wealth and celebrity had not delivered happiness and that . her relationship had been under strain. She revealed that her husband was unnerved by the confidence her recent weight loss had given her. In . a surprisingly candid interview, Michelle said: ‘It hasn’t been easy . for him. Before I was always there. Now, I’m more confident and . outgoing. I’m doing things I wouldn’t have done before. ‘I . am a different person. Most of the changes in our lives have been . brilliant — sex is better and we cook and eat together as a family — but . there is a lot of adjusting to do and it’s been more difficult for . Michael.’ She said: 'I've been with Michael since I . was 17 years old. We have our arguments like everyone else and we have . to work on our relationship every day. You can only do your best.' A statement issued yesterday through law firm Harper Macleod, said: 'It is with regret that we intimate that Mr Michael J Mone and Mrs Michelle G Mone OBE have decided to separate. 'There are no other parties involved and the split is amicable. Michael and Michelle's focus will be the welfare of their children, which is their main priority. 'They will continue to work together in their business MJM International. This is a private matter and they . would appreciate their privacy and that of their family being respected . at this difficult time.' Mrs Mone is considered one of the . UK's most successful businesswomen and her designs can be found in . department stores worldwide. She first found work as a model before creating the Ultimo bra and co-founding MJM International. The couple have three children together; Rebecca, 19, Declan, 15 and 11-year-old Bethany. Mrs Mone has previously admitted that, as the slightest hint of marriage problems, she enlisted the help of a life coach. ‘He helped us learn how to talk to each other,’ she told the Mail at the time. Of her husband's reaction to rumours . of marriage trouble at the time of the Gavin Henson incident, Mrs Mone . said: 'He knows me well enough to know that I’m never going to run off . with another man. 'This . isn’t about a woman who loses weight just to leg it with another man. That’s not me at all. My family is the most important thing in my life.’ Not supportive: Mrs Mone has previously admitted that her husband was . furious over her decision to model for her company's ad campaign . Mrs Mone appears regularly on TV shows. Here she poses with fellow Celebrity Masterchef contestants (from left) Nick Pickard, Linda Lusardi and Darren Campbell . The businesswoman also appeared in the ITV show 71 Degrees North with (from left) Shane Richie, Joe Absolom, Marcus Patrick and Konnie Huq . Success story: Mrs Mone pictured at the launch of Ultimo in 1999 with twins Kirsty Langlea (left) and Kelly - she is now worth  £39million . Michelle and her husband launched MJM . International in 1996, and Ultimo's popularity soared after Julia . Roberts wore one of the company's bras for her role in . Erin Brockovich. In . October, the Scottish entrepreneur announced a partnership with Tesco to . create an exclusive 'affordable' bra brand called Bra Queen. The . deal comes two years after MJM International business launched a luxury . lingerie collection, Diamond Boutique, in Tesco stores. The company also designs collections for Debenhams and Asda. Argentine . actress and supermodel Luisana Lopilato, who is married to Michael . Buble, was recently revealed as the latest face of Ultimo. Mrs Mone, from the East End of . Glasgow, left school at 15 and joined Labatts Brewers in Glasgow, . working her way up to be running the sales and marketing team by the . time she was just 20, before going on to launch her own company in 1996. She started building her lingerie . empire during her 20s when she developed the gel-filled Ultimo bra. Support: The lingerie tycoon took to her Twitter page to thank followers for their messages . Confidence: The entrepreneur (pictured left in . 2005 and right in 2010) was candid about how her husband struggled to . deal with the confidence her six-stone weight loss gave her . On the rocks? Last year pictures of Mrs Mone leaving a party with Gavin Henson made headlines . She . has always been proud of her success and has little compunction about . showing it, driving around Glasgow in her white Aston Martin convertible . with the top pulled down. There is also a Bentley and Range Rover in . her garage. She was less proud of her once-ample . figure, however. She said that working with a string of supermodels such . as Rachel Hunter and Helena Christensen had left her feeling inadequate . about her body. She embarked on a strict regime of . diet and exercise, resulting in a dramatic weight loss.  Unfortunately, . Mrs Mone’s newfound confidence in her appearance has coincided with, and . perhaps contributed to, the most troubled period in her marriage. In recent years her television work . has increased, with appearances on a celebrity version of The Apprentice . and regular slots on the You’re Fired programme which follows the main . show. Earlier this year she appeared on . Celebrity Masterchef where it soon became evident that the tycoon had . spent very little of her married life preparing meals for her husband . and three children. Her husband, she admitted, had always done most of the cooking. Last year the couple doubled the size . of their home in Glasgow after striking a £650,000 deal to buy and . bulldoze a neighbour’s six-bedroom villa. However, some local residents . branded the new house a ‘monstrosity’ and lodged official objections. Mrs Mone's . bank balance is set to continue to soar as a collection of beauty . products is planned for next year, together with a perfume. Sales at MJM International topped £10million for the first time last year. Last year Mrs Mone said the MJM International business had been valued at £48m by business advisers. Mrs Mone and . her husband own all of the shares in the company, after buying the . stakes of investors Sir Tom Hunter and Arcadia chief executive Ian . Grabiner, who had invested in the company in 1999, for £800,000. Answering the door at the house last night, Mr Mone said the marriage split was a private matter and he had no comment to make.

"Panagiotis Kone is probably hoping he'll never have to encounter Nemanja Matic on a football pitch for a long, long time after the latter recently reduced him to tears. The incident occured during Greece's 2-0 friendly defeat at home to Serbia on Tuesday night.

The emotional outburst saw Kone having to be dragged away from Matic by his Greece team-mates in one of the most bizarrest of incidents. Matic, who has forged a reputation as tough player, afforded a wry smile at Kone's expense in the process as the game was temporarily paused. And although Matic could see the funny side, the whole night was no laughing moment for Kone as goals from Radoslav Petrovic and Nemanja Gudelj condemned Greece to another defeat during the international break.

"The Census Bureau revealed on Tuesday a report showing that 2013 saw the smallest gender wage gap in history. While the gap was the smallest in disparity data that dates back to 1960, women still make significantly less than men. In 2013, women earned 78.3 cents on a man's dollar. That was up slightly from 2012, when women made 76.5 percent of what men did. Still serious problem: The Census Bureau revealed on Tuesday data showing that 2013 saw the smallest gender wage gap in history--but it's still a significant disparity . Louisiana has the nation's largest gender pay gap, with women paid about two thirds of what men are paid, according to new census data. Figures from 2013 also show that Mississippi's gap was 77 percent, about average nationally, but average pay for both men and women in Mississippi was the nation's lowest: $39,956 and $30,667 respectively. 'There's still a $10,000 or thereabouts difference,' said former state Sen. Gloria Williamson, a member of the Mississippi Commission on the Status of Women. In Louisiana, by contrast, men's pay was in the top half nationally, averaging $48,318, while women's pay ranked 44th among the states and Washington, D.C. at $31,865. That indicates high gender segregation in Louisiana jobs, 'possibly in the oil and gas area, which pays well but doesn't have a lot of women,' said Lisa Maatz, vice president of governmental relations for the American Association of University Women, which used census data for men's and women's average pay to calculate the pay gap for all 51 jurisdictions. The District of Columbia had both the narrowest gender gap — women's pay averaged 91 percent of men's — and the highest average pay at $67,610 for men and $61,760 for women. It was followed by New York state at 86 percent, Maryland at 85 percent, and Florida, California and Arizona at 84 percent. The widest gaps, after Louisiana's, were 69 percent for Wyoming and West Virginia and 70 percent for Utah and North Dakota. Most of the top states and Washington, D.C., have highly educated workforces, Maatz said. 'The average educational attainment for women in this area is much higher than the national average. We do know that getting an education can help women close the pay gap. It doesn't completely close it but it is one of the best tools women have to help boost themselves,' she said. The bottom five, like Louisiana, tend to rely heavily on 'kind of traditional male jobs,' she said. 'In West Virginia you have coal mining; in Wyoming you have ranching and farming. In North Dakota, there's a booming energy and gas industry.' Some of the gap may just reflect the way income is reported, Maatz said. 'We know, and ranchers talk about it, that when you're running a ranch it's a family operation. But when you report the income you report it for the head of household.' Williamson said seven equal-pay bills were introduced in the Mississippi Legislature last year. 'They all died. They never even got before the chairman of the committee.' Mississippi's U.S. senators, both Republicans, both voted against a national bill. Williamson said women nationwide should all stage a one-day strike. 'Don't go to work. Don't go to the office. Don't go to schools. Don't go if you work for the state of Mississippi. Just stay home. One day. And see what happens.'","The U.S. Census revealed on Tuesday that the 2013 saw the smallest gender pay gap in history .

"Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs' brother has spoken out for the first time about the affair that destroyed his marriage and rocked the world of football. It was a national scandal when Ryan's' eight-year affair with his brother Rhodri's wife hit the headlines in 2011. The ex-Welsh international had taken out a super-injunction  to prevent the scandal being revealed, and even took legal action against Twitter users, before the story finally broke. Scroll down for videos . Rhodri Giggs (pictured) brother of Ryan Giggs, has spoken out for the first time about the affair that destroyed his marriage and rocked the world of football . Now Rhodri has revealed how Ryan's shocking act of betrayal blew apart his marriage and left him picking up the pieces more than three years later. The younger brother of the Manchester United assistant manager has told his story for the first time ever on television on new Channel Five Series He Left Me For My Mother and Other Betrayals. And he revealed he had never even received an apology from Ryan. 'I haven't spoken to him since it happened,' Rhodri told Wales Online. 'I don't care about an apology I just want to get on with my life. That cloud will be over his head, and her head. My conscience is very clear.' It was a national scandal when Ryan's' eight-year affair with Natasha Giggs (pictured), wife of Rhodri, hit the headlines in 2011 . Rhodri claims that the former Manchester United ace (pictured) has not even given him an apology for the shocking act of betrayl . The affair was even more shocking as they pair had been inseperable as children and Rhodri said he had 'worshipped the ground' Ryan walked on. Their relationship only began to change when their father Danny Wilson, who played rugby union and league for Wales, walked out on them. The story of Ryan and Natasha's relationship broke after Welsh model and Big Brother contestant, Imogen Thomas, spoke out about her liaisons with the now Manchester United assistant manager. Rhodri only discovered the torrid affair when he read it in the newspaper- brought over by his mother-in-law. 'Natasha had done a disappearing act one day, I'd been playing football at Old Trafford, came home and fallen asleep early and woke up at 3am and she wasn't home. 'At 6am her mum knocked on the door with a paper and a letter. That's how I found out, from reading the News of The World with her mum sitting next to me. Ryan and Stacey have stayed together through the scandal unlike his brother Rhodri and Natasha, who separated after she appeared in Celebrity Big Brother . Despite the public humiliation, Ryan's wife Stacey Cooke has remained with her husband and their two children . 'I phoned him saying 'Is it true?' but he denied it. I didn't know what to believe. 'You've got two people here you supposedly trust, and you want to believe both of them.' But Natasha showed him proof of the affair in a collection of text messages and pictures sent by Ryan. The football pro later told Rhodri the eight-year relationship with his wife had been 'just sex' and had meant nothing. 'He'd demolished my family over sex,' he added. Rhodri, who is also a  footballer and plays part time for FC United of Manchester, had attempted to keep his family together after the scandal but said his marriage had crumbled. 'I wanted to keep my family together because what destroyed me, what made me so angry in my life is when my father left,' he added. 'And I didn't want that with my kids.

"Sheffield United football club should 'think really long and hard' about bringing back rapist Ched Evans after he is released from jail, Nick Clegg warned today. The Deputy Prime Minister warned club bosses they cannot 'wish away' the Evans' rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans. To the fury of thousands of people, the club's manager Nigel Clough yesterday revealed officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison tomorrow. Deputy PM Nick Clegg, a Sheffield MP, today suggested former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans, 25, should not return to the club after his release from prison on a rape conviction . The case has sparked huge controversy, following comments by ITV star Judy Finnigan in which she suggested Evans should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'. The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire. An online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted 90,000 supporters at the weekend, but by last night, more than 145,000 had put their names to it. The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to 'refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player'. It argues: 'To even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist.' Today Mr Clegg, an MP in Sheffield, appeared to suggest that he thought the club was wrong to offer Evans a way back. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: 'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model. 'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that, and he has committed a very, very serious crime.' Remarks: Evans, 25, who will be released from jail within days, has 'served his time', Miss Finnigan said . Mr Clegg repeatedly insisted it was a decision for the club and not for politicians, but added: 'I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people. 'My opinion is this; rape is an incredibly serious offence, unbelievably serious offence. 'He has done his time but I just don't believe that the owners of the football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened. 'And that is what he will be known for and that is something which, particularly for the youngsters following that team they will always be aware of. 'I think football players these days, they get paid a lot of money, they are public figures and you can't ignore that.' Rather than sack Evans when he was jailed, Sheffield United instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012. Fighting back: Chloe Madeley was threatened with rape - by a coward behind a computer screen . Manager Clough told BBC Radio Sheffield yesterday: ‘We’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it.' Professional Footballers’ Association chairman Gordon Taylor said last week that Evans should be allowed to continue his career on his release. But former Sports Minister Richard Caborn, a lifelong Sheffield United fan, told the Daily Mail that Evans should not be allowed back on a football pitch unless he publicly apologised or his conviction was quashed on appeal, adding: ‘People should have a second chance as long as they acknowledge what they have done is wrong.’ Evans still maintains his innocence, and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign  making the case that he was wrongly convicted. Judy Finnegan sparked fury during her debut as a panellist on Loose Women this week when she suggested Evans should be allowed to go back to the club. After a huge backlash about the remarks branded 'disgusting' and 'damaging', she was eventually forced to 'apologise unreservedly' for the offence she had caused. However her daughter Chloe has since been viciously trolled online. Yesterday it was revealed police are investigating after a Twitter user told the 27-year-old, that her mother had given her 'blessing' for her to be raped. Mr Clegg condemned the attacks on the daughter of TV's Richard and Judy. 'Whatever you think of what Judy said... it is outrageous that people are being as menacing and vile towards Chloe in that way. 'There are laws of course that can lead to people being prosecuted if they are inciting hatred or violence towards other people. 'It has got to stop. It is just not on that someone can say something in the way that they did and their daughter gets targeted in such a threatening and offensive way.' Chloe Finnegan today hit back at her attackers. In an article for the Mail she wrote: 'I was horrified, and disgusted. I was livid that someone could attack me and my family in such a way. 'Social media might make people seem less real, might make comments seem less personal, but I am a real person with real, very human emotions. 'The trolls have seized upon this and are issuing us with all kinds of abuse. My father is protective – as any man would be given such threats – and has taken screen shots of the messages. 'He says he will be reporting them to the police and that prosecution awaits. I certainly hope that the vile trolls who threatened to rape me will get their just deserts.' The South Yorkshire club has refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction . A petition urging Sheffield United not to reinstate Ched Evans once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people. So far the club, which signed Evans for £3million in 2009, has refused to say whether it will take him back. Women's rights campaigner Jean Hatchet set up the petition on the website Change.org, calling on the club's chairman Kevin McCabe and part-owner Prince Abdullah Bin Musa'ad Bin Abdul Aziz to make it clear that Evans – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome. In an open letter to the pair, she said: 'I'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before. Unfortunately, he still hasn't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd resign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans. 'They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.' During the trial in 2012, Evans admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, but denied rape. Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey and Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon Taylor have backed his return. Sheffield United did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.","Deputy Prime Minister warns club must think 'long and hard' about player .

"This was Divock Origi’s big audition to the Liverpool public. Could the young Belgian survive out there on a cold, dank and rainy November night on Merseyside? Granted he was on the ‘wrong’ side of the divide so to speak, taking to the hallowed Goodison Park turf instead of his future home at Anfield, but the 19-year-old Belgian knew this was his opportunity to shine with the eyes of all Liverpool supporters on him – not to mention those of his soon-to-be-rivals. A goal for Origi against Everton on Thursday, helping Lille to knock some of the stuffing out of the Toffees’ so-far promising Europa League campaign, and immediately he would have been a hero in the Red side of this football-loving city. Divock Origi failed to shine in the blue half of Merseyside as he was kept at bay by Everton's defence . Origi, pictured with Leon Osman, could not find a way of beating Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard . Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . Facebook: UEFAEuropaLeague . Twitter: @EuropaLeague . And at uefa.com . For Liverpool fans are crying out for a striker to love right now – and Origi hopes to be that man, but he unfortunately is not yet ready to fill such big, pressurised boots just yet. Having been deprived of the free-scoring Daniel Sturridge since the beginning of September, Liverpool’s trio of replacement strikers – Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and, of course, the mercurial Mario Balotelli – have managed precisely zero Premier League goals between them this season. Brendan Rodgers took a calculated gamble on signing Balotelli from AC Milan for £16million in the summer and, as of yet, that roll of the dice has not landed favourably. But Balotelli is only one of two strikers signed by the Liverpool boss this summer – Origi was snapped up from Lille for £10m but immediately loaned back to the Ligue 1 side. A star of the World Cup – displacing Everton’s £28m forward Romelu Lukaku in the Belgian side for the latter stages – Origi was seen as a shrewd buy. Everton ace Phil Jagielka kept a close eye on Belgium international Origi  during the Europa League encounter . Origi competes for the ball with Everton full back Leighton Baines at Goodison Park . Yet Rodgers took the decision to loan him back, deeming him not-yet-ready to lead Liverpool’s line in the heated battle of the Premier League. And it was Lukaku who won the battle of the Belgian strikers in the Europa League. The Everton striker was more involved and influenced play far more than his young rival. To be fair on Origi though, he was not helped by his team-mates’ hapless display at Goodison Park. Lille were inept in almost every possible way. Reds boss Rodgers is keeping a close eye on Origi’s progress, having told LiverpoolFC.com that he is monitoring each and every one of the Belgian’s game – and he is almost certain to have seen his display at Goodison and come to the conclusion that he was vindicated in his decision. As Rodgers says, there is a lot for which Origi can ‘improve’ on. He is raw, there is no doubt about that. Origi is not the most prolific striker in the world – he is not going to challenge Cristiano Ronaldo and ex-Red Luis Suarez for European football’s Golden Boot anytime soon – but he has bagged four goals already this season in 10 starts (plus three substitute appearances), showing he can find the back of the net. Liverpool loanee Origi played the full 90 minutes against Everton but failed to have an impact on the scoreline . Origi (right) celebrates with Kevin Mirallas after scoring against Russia at the 2014 World Cup . The 10-cap Belgian needs to develop and grow into his own, that much is clear, but he is no mug and he is no shrinking violet. It may take him time to adapt to English football but, on the basis of this performance, there are positives. He put his 6ft 1in frame around and, although he weakly diverted a header towards Tim Howard in the first half, he did cause Tony Hibbert some problems down the left. Thursday night was a key night in his development and he will come through it a better player. He ran tirelessly for a cause in which his team-mates gave him precious little to work with. It was painful at times watching him run down another terrible long ball, launched into No Man’s Land with no godly hope of Origi being able to get a hold of it and launch a meaningful attack. Pushed off the ball too easily by Phil Jagielka on occasion, he came back in the second half and had already by that stage started to put his body on the line and show his own strength. He also displayed some lovely touches on the ball, he ran his heart out for the cause and he now knows what it is like to play in front of Liverpool’s closest rivals. Origi is certainly not the finished product yet but come next summer Balotelli in particular better beware – he may be displaced in Rodgers’ thinking by a young but upwardly-mobile Belgian.

"Taking painkillers could increase the number of headaches a person suffers from, an expert has claimed . Taking painkillers could increase the number of headaches a person suffers from, an expert has claimed. Professor Gillian Leng, Deputy Chief Executive of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), said that people who use too many painkillers to treat tension headaches could actually be causing themselves further pain. She told the Daily Express: ‘It is important for people to understand that different headaches require different treatments, so a correct diagnosis is vital. ‘People may not know that overusing some types of medication for treating tension-type headaches or migraines can actually make things worse, causing further pain.’ As a result, Nice is releasing new guidelines to help doctors treat people suffering from headaches. They hope that the guidelines will ensure patients receive the correct treatment. Sam Chong, a neurologist who has worked with Nice to draw up guidelines for the treatment of headaches, told the Daily Express: ‘The effective management of headaches depends on making a correct diagnosis and agreeing on an appropriate treatment plan. Medication overuse headaches are a common problem.’ Joanna Hamilton-Colclough, director of Migraine Action, said that the new standard is ‘essential’ in ensuring there continues to be progress in recognising the impact headaches can have on an individual, as well as on society. It is believed that ten million people in the UK experience frequent headaches and that they cause 25 million lost working days every year. An estimated 500,000 women and 100,000 men in the UK suffer daily headaches caused by the overuse of painkillers. Research suggests the frequent use of drugs such as codeine, paracetamol, ibuprofen and aspirin can often be the main reason people suffer from repeated headaches - and has shown that between a quarter and two-thirds of headache sufferers overuse painkillers. They are not overdosing on their medication; they are simply taking the pills for long periods of time. But the more a painkiller is taken, the more resistant the body becomes to it. So the sufferer has then to resort to a stronger painkiller. When . the medication wears off, they can get a withdrawal reaction - known as . a 'rebound' headache - prompting them to take more medication. Professor Gillian Leng, Deputy Chief Executive of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, said that people who use too many painkillers to treat tension headaches could be causing themselves further pain . By this point, it is the absence of the medication that is actually causing the headache. The reason rebound headaches happen is not entirely clear, although it's thought that painkiller overuse affects the flow of pain messages to the nerves. The problem is more common among women. This is largely because women are five times more likely to be affected by migraines than men. Dr Anne MacGregor, director of clinical research at the City of London Migraine Clinic, explains: ‘Medication overuse will lead to you waking up with a headache because your pain threshold is at its lowest - the painkillers will have worn off during the night. ‘Using painkillers no more than two to three times a week is fine. It's when they're taken more frequently that the problems start.’ 'The only solution for rebound headaches is to stop taking the medication causing them.","Professor Gillian Leng said using too many painkillers causes more pain .

"Professor Pollock's son Hamish, 14, suffered a shattered cheekbone playing rugby (stock picture) When the phone rang at work, that Wednesday afternoon 11 years ago, I thought it would be a routine call. Instead, I got the news no mother ever wants to hear: my elder son, Hamish, then just 14, was in hospital, badly injured. He had been hurt while he should have been safe at school, playing a rugby match. Feeling sick, I rushed to be by his side. He had a shattered cheekbone, caused by contact with another player’s knee. His face looked distorted and his eye socket was hanging down. He was in a lot of pain and he couldn’t eat or drink except through a straw. In addition, he was concussed and disoriented. The surgeon said his injury was equivalent to that suffered by someone going through a car windscreen. As a mother, naturally I was horrified, but seeing his battered form stirred another thought, equally disturbing. I am a public health doctor — Professor of Public Health Research and Policy at Queen Mary, University of London. How common, I wondered, were such injuries in children? And how dangerous a sport was rugby? Should it be something that children are forced to play at school? After all, it wasn’t the first time Hamish had been injured playing rugby. A year earlier, he’d broken his leg, with the long-term result that he still has to wear a special insole in his shoe. And at just eight years old, he’d broken his nose. When he broke his leg and cheekbone we were living in Edinburgh, and I thought of all the young boys and teenagers I saw in plaster on the streets, and hobbling up and down the school drive. Most of all, I thought of my old friend, a fellow doctor, who was injured in a rugby match aged 24, leaving him paralysed from the neck down. Now, after a decade of research into the risks of playing rugby at school, I have published a book for parents: Tackling Rugby, What Every Parent Should Know About Injuries. Rugby is a very dangerous game, which should not be compulsory in any British school, says Professor Pollock . What I discovered while writing it was both shocking and extremely worrying, and it led me to the conclusion that rugby is a very dangerous game, which should not be compulsory in any British school. According to the International Rugby Board, there are 1,900 rugby union clubs in England, with 362,319 pre-teen male players and 698,803 teen male players —1,061,122 in total. School rugby injuries can be severe. At the more minor end are bruises and sprains. Then there are more serious injuries: fractures, torn ligaments, dislocated shoulders. Most serious of all are the concussions, the spinal cord and head injuries. Benjamin Robinson, 14, from Co Antrim, Northern Ireland, died in 2011 after he collapsed on the pitch . Then there are the fatalities: children like Benjamin Robinson, 14, from Co Antrim, Northern Ireland, who died in 2011 after he collapsed on the pitch. Even though he had suffered a concussion following a collision, he played on for 25 minutes. A second blow to the head killed him. During my research, I found that there is a culture of letting boys play on with a concussion, despite the fact that it can leave them brain damaged, and can prove lethal. Earlier this year a court heard how Lucas Neville from Dublin, became disabled after playing a school match despite having concussion. But even though such serious injuries do occur on school rugby pitches, I learned that nobody in the UK is collecting data about them. Rugby injuries are under-reported and badly-reported, usually not reported at all. A&E departments no longer collect data on the cause of injuries — the Government stopped funding it. How can we prevent injuries if we don’t know what they are or how often they occur? Schools and all the Rugby Unions should be collating this data. So, as part of my research, I undertook a pilot study of six schools in Edinburgh in 2009. I found that over the course of a season, the average risk of injury to a player is 17 per cent, or one in six, and in other studies, in some schools it is as high as one in three. In our small study, in just 193 matches there were 37 injuries. Of these, 20 required A&E attendance, and 65 per cent prevented further participation in the sport for three weeks or more. If you knew your child was taking this big a risk, would you still want them to play rugby? My son Hamish stopped playing rugby for ever after his third injury. I made it clear that I didn’t want him to play again and he agreed. Although he had successful surgery, he had to have time off school, and it was months before he could get back to playing the trombone or taking part in sport. The accident shook him up, knocking his confidence. He knew that next time, he might not be so lucky. When I told my younger son, then 11, that he couldn’t play rugby either, he was furious. Over the course of her research and campaigning, Allyson has had a lot of support from doctors and from parents, but also faced a hostility . Eventually, he accepted it, but it was hard for him. Even though he’d seen his brother’s injuries, he didn’t understand the risks; children think they’re invincible. I had to take on the full force of the school’s disapproval, too. Over the course of my research and campaigning, I’ve had a lot of support from doctors and from parents, but I’ve also faced a hostility. This is a hugely emotive subject. People are passionate about rugby. Some people say I am advocating a nanny state, but it’s the State that picks up the pieces when children are injured, in terms of NHS care, special education support and social services. To my horror, I’ve also faced personal abuse for my views, much of it from anonymous men who pepper their emails with swear-words. They say I have no right to comment on rugby, because I’m a woman who has never played the game. That’s ridiculous: I research and write about cancer, but I’ve never had cancer either. Many parents write to Professor Pollock asking how they can stop their rugby-loving sons playing, following nasty injuries . Many parents write to me asking how they can stop their rugby-loving sons playing, following nasty injuries. Only yesterday, at 3.30am a father emailed me, saying: ‘My son is concussed in hospital, how do I stop him from playing rugby again?’ I’m not calling for a ban on rugby at school. I’m calling for parents to be given information so they know the risks, and I want to see rugby made safer for children, with an end to scrums and tackles — where nearly all the injuries occur. I’d like school rugby to become touch rugby, instead of contact rugby. All injuries should be recorded, and none should be acceptable or seen as ‘an act of God’. Most of all, children should be safe at school.

"Retired managing director: John Knott, 71, was found dead at his home on Monday . A retired managing director who feared . his home would be surrounded by travellers’ camps is thought to have . shot dead his seriously ill wife before turning the gun on himself. John . Knott, 71, and his wife Elizabeth were found dead at their . 300-year-old country house following a battle to stop a new site being . built on their doorstep. He . is said to have feared being hemmed in if council planners approved the . camp in a field next to their £500,000 property – which already had . travellers living nearby. Mr . Knott also faced the strain of caring for his 70-year-old wife, whose . health was believed to be fading as she battled Alzheimer’s Disease. Neighbours . said yesterday that these problems may have tipped him over the edge, . causing him to shoot his wife of 37 years and then himself. Police . confirmed a shotgun registered to him was recovered from the house at . Pow Green, a hamlet outside Ledbury in Herefordshire. Officers are . investigating whether the deaths were the result of a murder-suicide or a . suicide pact, but said nobody else was involved. The . couple were described as pillars of the community, who moved to the . area from Worcestershire following Mr Knott’s retirement in 2006. Mr . Knott, a former church warden,  was said to be under ‘a lot of stress’ while fighting a planning application for the travellers’ camp in a . field next  to their house. Six . weeks ago, he wrote a letter,  published on Herefordshire County . Council’s website, objecting to plans to convert the field into a . one-family  site featuring a toilet block and  septic tank. Police were called to the home, pictured, of John and Elizabeth Knott near Bosbury after worried relatives could not get in contact with the couple . Mr Knott, feared that his property, pictured, would be impacted by any adjacent development after a family sought to change a field to the right of the property from agricultural to traveller accomodation . Mr Knott, whose house, marked 1 bounded the site, marked 2, objected to the planned traveller's site marked 3 . In . it, he said: ‘There are at least eight settled (traveller) families . within a one-mile radius of the proposed site. The area cannot sustain . any more.’ He also . expressed concerns that his home and neighbouring properties could be . flooded by sewage from the septic tank if the plans for the camp were . approved. The proposed site would have been the second set up near the Knotts’ house in two years. In 2012, the council approved plans for a traveller camp on the other side of their property, separated from them by woodland. Two caravans and a day room were installed on the Oakfield Nash End Lane site. Last . night, a former colleague of Mr Knott’s at Birmingham-based Ashford . Construction said: ‘They faced being virtually surrounded by traveller . sites. It drove him  to despair.’ Lyn . Hodgkiss, who runs a  butcher’s shop in a nearby village where Mr Knott . was a regular customer, said: ‘His wife had Alzheimer’s. He was . fighting the travellers near his house and it must have got too much for . him. Mr Knott had written to Herefordshire Council to express his concern about this planned change of useage from Agriculture to a one-family traveller site . ‘He always used to . come in and give us a nice order and he used to come in all happy and . ask how our son is. I could only say good things about him.’ A neighbour added that the couple were ‘very chatty and friendly’ when they moved to the area. He added: ‘Mr Knott had worked in the building trade but his wife was pretty poorly. ‘Apparently she was fading. He was very concerned about having a camp next door at the same time as caring for his wife. 'The . last time I saw him, he said he was under a lot of stress. He said he . was worried about the possible impact the traveller camp would have on . them because they have to drive past their house to get there.’ Mr Knott, whose property is circled, claimed the planned development, outlined in red, also presented a danger to traffic in the area due to the narrow road . Mr Knott said in his planning objection that he feared that developing a site so close to his home could put his 300-year-old cottage at risk of flooding . Mr Knott, feared the site to the south, marked in red would lead to flooding of his home, circled centre. He told planners that there was already traveller accommodation in the area, circled top centre . The couple’s local vicar, the Reverend Nicky Seabright, said yesterday: ‘The community are deeply shocked. ‘We do know that Mrs Knott was suffering from a progressive illness which must have been challenging for them both.’ Mrs Knott, who was known by her middle name Anne, had a 48-year-old daughter called Jane from a previous marriage. There was no answer at her home in Worcester yesterday. Other relatives declined to comment. Mr Knott, who was a former managing director of a construction firm, also expressed concern about the hand-drawn map attached to the planning application . Mr Knott's cottage is located on the northern boundary of the area marked in blue on this document . A . West Mercia Police spokesman said that officers were called to the . house at around 10.30am on Monday after family members were unable to . contact the couple. He added: ‘We would like to speak to anyone who saw Anne and John Knott prior to Monday August 11. ‘At . present, the last confirmed sighting was around midday on Saturday .

"Bernard Hopkins will return to the ring despite suffering a crushing defeat over the weekend to Russian Sergey Kovalev, the 49-year-old former champion said on Tuesday. Hopkins, who failed to win a round on any of the three judges' scorecards in the light-heavyweight title unification bout, ended speculation of his retirement by saying he will fight 'one more time.'

It will not be a freak show. I will never shortchange myself and my dignity.' Hopkins, who defended the middleweight title a record 20 times from 1995 to 2005 and has never been knocked out, was floored Saturday in the first round by Kovalev, a fighter 18 years his junior. But the fighter known as The Executioner was back in the gym on Monday. 'Physically, if you see me today, you'd think I didn't have a fight (on Saturday),' he said. 'But inside, trust me, my arms and the back of my head and the top of my head, oh yeah, I was in a fight. I've been in the hot tub for the last 48 hours.' The 39-year-old insists he wants to leave the sport with his dignity still in tact . The Russian sends down another barrage of blows but Hopkins' 'underated' chin withstood the punishment . Kovalev, who now lives in Los Angeles, retained his World Boxing Organization championship and captured Hopkins' International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association belts. He boosted his record to 26-0-1 with 23 knockouts. 'I had the most underrated chin in boxing but I think that changed Saturday,' said Hopkins. 'I've never been in this business to prove I can take a punch. That's why I've been around so long. 'People said I was crazy to fight him. Whether it's in boxing, sport or even in life, you just have to man up. And you know what I've been hearing? People who started off rooting for the young guy ended up rooting for the old guy.' Hopkins, nicknamed 'The Alien' made his typical entrance to the ring, but it could yet be his last . Hopkins came under incredible pressure towards the end of the fight but managed to go the distance . Hopkins, who turns 50 in January and has a 55-7-2 record with 32 knockouts over his 26-year pro career, insisted he won't 'cherry pick' his final opponent. 'It will be somebody that's a champion,' he said. 'It will be from a division beneath me but where they're comfortable and I'm comfortable. It will be someone that's dominating today. 'I'm going to do it the way I've done it my whole career. People respect you for fighting fights that others run away from. I want to fight the best no matter how it pans out.","Bernard Hopkins was beaten by Sergey Kovalev in their unification bout .

He is blocked by what appears to be a group of Chelsea fans travelling to the Parc des Princes for the 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night. Chelsea fans stopped a black man getting on the train before their side's match with Paris Saint-Germain . The man was twice prevented from getting on the carriage as the fans pushed him back on to the platform . The man talks to the Chelsea fans on the train but they would not allow him to board . Mitchell McCoy was one of around 40 or 50 Chelsea supporters on the train and he stated they were singing about Terry, who was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association in October 2012 for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. In Terry's case, the regulatory commission stated that the Chelsea captain was 'not a racist'. McCoy, a season-ticket holder who travelled to Paris with five friends, was named on Twitter following the publication of the video. The 17-year-old from Fulham in London said: 'I'm not in the video but I'm on the carriage. We got on the train and at the station where the man was trying to get on we stopped for a couple of minutes. 'He tried to get on and a few people were pushing him off because there wasn't much space on the carriage. You couldn't move. 'People were saying it was because he was black. It's not true at all. I personally think it's because he was a PSG fan. Obviously they didn't want him anywhere with us. 'That guy in the video tried to force himself on, so they pushed him off.' A chant of 'We're racist and that's the way we like it' is clearly audible on the video, but McCoy contended it was not about the passenger. He added: 'That song was about John Terry. The only words I know is 'he's a racist, he's a racist' and I don't know the rest.' Fans were also filmed chanting 'We’re racist, we’re racist and that’s the way we like it' while on the train . Chelsea fan Mitchell McCoy claims the fans were singing about John Terry who was banned by the FA for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand . Asked why that song was sung at that moment, he said: 'I'm not sure. I didn't sing it. 'It wasn't just that one time that it happened. It wasn't just with the black people that we weren't letting on. 'There was white people, women that people weren't allowing on. There was no space. 'They were saying, ""You can't get on this carriage, you have to go somewhere else"".' McCoy believes fingers were pointed at him following 'a stupid Tweet I did last night, (about) the John Terry song'. He is aware of Chelsea's plan to support any criminal prosecution and hand out banning orders to any supporters found to have offended. 'I wouldn't say (I am) worried, because I haven't done anything wrong, neither has any of my mates,' he said. 'I don't see how that can be used against me because I'm not in the video. 'Of course we're concerned (about being banned). It wouldn't surprise me at all. '(But) they ban you for anything. It wouldn't surprise me.' Asked if he would be prepared to help Chelsea identify those involved, McCoy added: 'I don't recognise any of them so I wouldn't be much use.'","Chelsea fans were filmed preventing a black man from boarding a train .

"Mexican police wounded a pregnant teenager from the United States when they opened fire on a vehicle that ignored orders to stop, authorities said Monday, in the latest episode of violence involving Mexico's security forces. Both the girl and her baby are out of danger, said prosecutors in the violence-plagued northeastern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States. The girl and a friend were leaving a convenience store Sunday night near a bridge that links the Mexican border city of Reynosa and Pharr, Texas, when state police officers ordered their truck to stop. Instead the driver sped away and police shot at the tires, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. When police reached the truck, the driver had disappeared and the girl was found with a stomach wound. The officers took her to a hospital. The statement said an unspecified number of officers will be questioned over the shooting. Incident: Mexican police wounded a pregnant teenager from the United States when they opened fire on a vehicle that ignored orders to stop, authorities said (file photo) El Universal reported the girl, Indira Michelle Blanco Lopez Gonzalez, is four months pregnant. The girl's alleged mother Paloma Gonzalez said her daughter was actually behind the wheel giving 14-year-old Eduardo Berrones a ride, according to the newspaper. She also said police pursued the truck and then shots were later audible, El Universal reported. Mexico's security forces have been involved in a series of scandals recently. In Tamaulipas, three American siblings and a Mexican men were found dead on October 30, two weeks after they were abducted outside the border city of Matamoros. Prosecutors investigating the murder have questioned nine agents from the tactical Hercules Group tasked with protecting the mayor after the families of the victims alleged that they had kidnapped the siblings. In the southern state of Guerrero, authorities have arrested 36 municipal police officers over charges that they shot at busloads of college students and handed 43 of them to a drug gang. Scene: The girl and a friend were leaving a convenience store Sunday night near a bridge that links the Mexican border city of Reynosa and Pharr, Texas, when state police officers ordered their truck to stop . Authorities said last week that suspected Guerreros Unidos gang members confessed to killing the students and incinerating their bodies in a crime that has rocked President Enrique Pena Nieto's administration. The government is also dealing with allegations of military abuse after seven soldiers were arrested in connection with the killing of 22 gang suspects south of Mexico City. Prosecutors have charged three of the seven with murder over the deaths of eight suspects, but the National Human Rights Commission says at least 12 suspects were killed after surrendering following a shootout.","Mexican police wounded a pregnant US teenager when they opened fire on a vehicle that ignored orders to stop, authorities said .

"Jose Mourinho has been fined £25,000 and warned over his future conduct by the Football Association for claiming there was a 'clear campaign' against Chelsea. The Blues boss' complaints following the draw at Southampton on December 28 were found to be improper and brought the game into disrepute. An independent regulatory commission found, however, that the comments did not imply officials were biased against Chelsea. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mourinho jokes about campaigns everywhere . Jose Mourinho said there was a campaign against Chelsea following the 1-1 draw against Southampton . The Chelsea boss said there was 'a campaign' against his side when talking to Sky Sports . Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing, Jose Mourinho has been fined £25,000 after he was found to have breached FA Rules in relation to media comments. The Chelsea manager denied that comments he made after the game against Southampton on 28 December 2014 constituted improper conduct in that they alleged and/or implied bias on the part of a referee or referees, and/or brought the game into disrepute. The Independent Regulatory Commission found the comments were a breach of FA Rule E3 in that they were improper and brought the game into disrepute. The Commission did not, however, find that the comments implied bias on the part of a referee or referees. Mr Mourinho, who had requested a non-personal hearing, was also warned as to his future conduct. An FA statement read: 'Following an independent regulatory commission hearing, Jose Mourinho has been fined £25,000 after he was found to have breached FA rules in relation to media comments.' Mourinho, who is on a reported £10million a year at Stamford Bridge, earns around the £29,000 mark every day. The 52-year-old attended a personal hearing after being charged following the comments, which came after Cesc Fabregas was denied a penalty and instead booked for a dive at St Mary's. It followed incidents of diving in previous matches involving Diego Costa, Willian, Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill. The Portuguese said afterwards: 'That's a campaign, that's a clear campaign. 'People, pundits, commentators, coaches from other teams - they react with Chelsea in a way they don't react to other teams. 'They put lots of pressure on the referee and the referee makes a mistake like this. We lose two points, Fabregas earns a yellow card. Despite appearing to be taken down by Southampton's Matt Targett, Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving . 'In other countries where I worked before, tomorrow in the sports papers it would be a front-page scandal because it is a scandal. 'I think it is a scandal because it is not a small penalty - it is a penalty like Big Ben. 'In this country - and I am happy with that, more than happy with that - we will just say that it was a big mistake with a big influence in the result. 'I am happy that it is this way, with respect for the referee. He made a big mistake like I make, like the players make sometimes.' The Spaniard can't believe his own eyes after getting booked against the Saints . Mourinho was also unhappy with referee Michael Oliver after side's Capital One Cup clash against Liverpool . The FA statement added: 'The Chelsea manager denied that comments he made after the game against Southampton on December 28, 2014 constituted improper conduct in that they alleged and/or implied bias on the part of a referee or referees, and/or brought the game into disrepute. 'The independent regulatory commission found the comments were a breach of FA rule E3 in that they were improper and brought the game into disrepute.

"Popular diets such as Atkins or Weight Watchers can help people lose weight quickly but in the long term may be no more effective than living healthily, a study claims. People on fad diets often lose weight in the short term, but they regain their lost pounds within two years and may be just as well off using traditional weight loss techniques, the researchers say. The advice comes amid an obesity crisis, with one adult in every four in England obese and three in 10 children between two and 15 overweight or obese. Scroll down for video . Fat fighter: People on fad diets often lose weight in the short term, but they regain their lost pounds within two years and may be just as well off using traditional weight loss techniques, researchers say . The researchers analysed clinical trials on four popular weight-loss diet plans: the low-carbohydrate Atkins diet; the South Beach diet, which distinguishes 'good' and 'bad' carbs and fats; the Weight Watchers calorie-counting diet; and the Zone diet, which stipulates a 3:4 ratio of protein to carbohydrates. They compared them with what they dubbed 'usual care', which refers to traditional methods to promote weight loss such as low-fat diets, behavioural weight loss intervention, nutritional counselling, or self-help materials. In trials comparing Weight Watchers to usual care, Weight Watchers dieters lost an average 7.7 to 13.2 pounds after a year compared to 1.8 to 11.9 pounds with usual care. However, after two years the weight lost was partially regained. In the only trial comparing the South Beach diet to usual care, no difference in weight loss occurred in 12 months, however the participants in this study were both severely obese and had undergone gastric bypass surgery. There are millions of people in Britain who aren't getting sufficient calories, protein, vitamins and minerals. Doctors say our growing reliance on fast food, coupled with soaring rates of binge-drinking, means many are lacking the vitamins and minerals essential for health. The result, in the most extreme cases, is pot-bellies, wasted limbs and emaciated bodies - all conditions more usually associated with famine victims in the developing world. While malnutrition can be fatal, in more mild forms it can cause a host of symptoms that impact on every day life, from hair loss and muscle wastage to food cravings and lethargy. Results from trials on the Atkins diet were inconsistent. Trials involving head-to-head comparisons between Atkins, Weight Watchers, Zone and usual care suggest that all four result in a modest weight loss at one year, as did those in the control group who received the usual care. Those on the Atkins diet lost an average 4.6 to 10.3lbs; Weight Watchers participants lost an average 6.6lbs; Zone dieters lost an average 3.5 to 7lbs; and control lost about 4.85lbs. In studies involving head-to-head comparisons, there were no marked differences between Atkins, Weight Watchers, and Zone diets at improving cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, or other cardiovascular risk factors. The longest diet studies researchers analysed lasted for two years, and results were only available for the Atkins or Weight Watchers diets. Those studies found dieters regained some of their weight over time. Choose one: Trials involving head-to-head comparisons between Atkins, Weight Watchers, Zone and usual care suggest that all four result in a modest weight loss at one year, as did those in the control group . Senior author Dr Mark Eisenberg, Professor of Medicine at Jewish General Hospital/McGill University in Canada, said: 'Despite their popularity and important contributions to the multi-million dollar weight loss industry, we still do not know if these diets are effective to help people lose weight and decrease their risk factors for heart disease. 'With such a small number of trials looking at each diet and their somewhat conflicting results, there is only modest evidence that using these diets is beneficial in the long-term.' Dr Eisenberg said to better understand the potential benefits from any one or all of these diets, researchers need to conduct large clinical trials directly comparing all four popular diets for long-term weight loss and changes in other heart disease risk factors. He added: 'A broader lifestyle intervention, which also involves doctors and other health professionals, may be more effective. 'This also tells doctors that popular diets on their own may not be the solution to help their patients lose weight.' The findings were published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.","Atkins, Weight Watchers, South Beach and Zone diets all examined .
