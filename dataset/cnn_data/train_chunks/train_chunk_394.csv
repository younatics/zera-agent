"Turkish authorities' use of live ammunition, tear gas, beatings and sexual assaults to crush street protests earlier this year constitute ""human rights violations on a massive scale,"" according to a report by human rights watchdog Amnesty International. Amnesty documented cases of Turkish riot police firing plastic bullets and tear gas canisters at the heads of protesters.  It also   accused police of sexually abusing female demonstrators and of severely beating and shooting protesters with live ammunition, resulting in the deaths of two men in separate incidents. The report, released Wednesday, focused on the turmoil that erupted in May and June, when police tried to put down an environmentalist sit-in.  Demonstrators had staged an Occupy Wall Street-style protest over government plans to demolish Istanbul's Gezi Park and replace it with a shopping mall. ""The levels of violence used by police in the course of Gezi Park protests clearly show what happens when poorly trained, poorly supervised police officers are instructed to use force -- and encouraged to use it unsparingly -- safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely ever to be identified or prosecuted for their abuses,"" said Amnesty International's Turkey expert, Andrew Gardner. The Turkish government has launched an investigation into the possible excess use of force.  At least one police officer from a counter-terrorism unit is standing trial along with other suspects for beating a protester named Ali Ismail Korkmaz in the Turkish city of Eskisehir.  The 19-year-old university student later died as a result of his injuries. Government announces democratic reforms . Amnesty International's report emerged two days after the Turkish government unveiled a long-awaited series of reforms, which  the rights group said fails ""to address these violations or to take any serious steps to ensure that they will not occur in the future."" Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan applauded what he called the ""democratization package,"" declaring it a historic moment for the country. The legislation lifts the ban on women wearing Islamic headscarves in public institutions.  However, women serving as police officers, judges or military personnel are still not allowed to wear headscarves. The reforms also removed the ban on teaching the Kurdish language, and ended the ban of the Kurdish letters ""q,"" ""x"" and ""w,""  which do not exist in the Turkish alphabet. However, Kurdish can only be taught in private schools, even though it is the language spoken by Turkey's largest ethnic minority. Another change called for expanding the definition and punishment for hate crimes committed on the basis of ethnicity or religious belief. The democratization package quickly inspired a chorus of criticism from a wide range of ethnic, religious and political groups. ""This is more of an election package,"" said Sebahat Tuncel, a lawmaker from the main Kurdish opposition party, referring to municipal elections expected to be held in 2014. ""This package could have lifted the obstacles to democratization. It could have lifted barriers to freedom of the press, to freedom of expression and amended the anti-terror laws,"" Tuncel added. Thousands of Kurds have been arrested in recent years, accused of collaborating with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), whose militants have been fighting a guerrilla war for the past 30 years against the Turkish state. Erdogan's government has tried to bring an end to the simmering conflict by launching negotiations with jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. The peace talks have prompted some of the PKK's thousands of fighters to voluntarily leave Turkey for neighboring Iraq. Meanwhile, women's groups and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual activists are upset that the reforms did not include reference to hate crimes committed on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Though Erdogan offered to create a cultural institute for Turkey's Roma minority and promised to return a government-seized monastery to the Assyrian Christians, he stopped short of reopening the Halki Seminary, which traditionally educated the country's top Greek Orthodox clergy. For decades, members of Turkey's dwindling Greek community, as well as many Western governments, have called for Turkey to lift its ban on Halki. ""I think it is a step forward and the government says more will come,"" wrote Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker from Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), in an e-mail to CNN. ""However, the real issue in Turkey is political and cultural polarization. I wish the package would address issues such as freedom of expression and pluralism."" Turkish president calls for reform . Turkey's president warned about the threats this polarization posed in an address before the Turkish parliament Tuesday. ""I viewed the peaceful demonstrations of the young people at Gezi Park... as a new manifestation of our democratic maturity,"" said Abdullah Gul. Gul argued that Turkey still had a long way to go in its democratization process. ""The effective and efficient operation of executive, legislative and judicial powers; the existence of a serious, constructive and strong opposition; a free, critical, impartial and independent media are of utmost importance for a country's democratic development,"" he said in his speech to lawmakers. Gul has been a loyal ally of Erdogan through the prime minister's decade in office. But as his term in the largely symbolic post of president draws to a close, Gul has increasingly challenged some of Erdogan's more controversial policies. The increasingly divergent political positions have prompted widespread speculation that Gul may be preparing to submit himself as a candidate to be the next prime minister of Turkey.","Police beat, shot, sexually abused protesters, rights group says .

"It's probably not the kind of thing voters will use to choose the leader of the free world. But the Web was taking no shortage of presidential potshots Wednesday over Republican candidate Mitt Romney's new mobile app, which embarrassingly misspelled ""America."" Yes, Internet. Welcome to AMERCIA. ""Sorry about the shaking California, that was just the rest of America laughing at Mitt Romney running for Pres. of #Amercia,"" wrote a person behind a parody President Obama account on Twitter (referencing a minor earthquake late Tuesday). The gaffe, presumably by some poor developer hired by the campaign, appears on ""With Mitt,"" the campaign's newly released iPhone app. The app invites users to photograph themselves with their choice of 14 pro-Romney slogans such as ""I'm a Mom For Mitt,"" ""Obama Isn't Working"" and ""The America We Love,"" and then share them on social media. But one of the slogans reads, ""A Better Amercia."" Oops. Somebody didn't observe the ""I-before-C"" rule. An update to the ""With Mitt"" app, with the typo corrected, became available at about 1 p.m. on Wednesday. No one with the campaign was speaking on the record about it, but staffers were downplaying its importance in the run-up to November. By Wednesday afternoon, the campaign also had paid for a ""promoted tweet"" that appears when a Twitter users searches for ""Amercia."" Slips of the tongue by political candidates are, of course, not uncommon. In 2008, then-candidate Obama got grief for saying he'd visited ""all 57 states."" And Vice President Joe Biden's free-speaking nature has gotten him no shortage of headlines. But the Web's politically minded (many of whom, presumably, don't consider Romney their top choice), were noting that when a mistake appears in writing, it shows a lack of attention to detail. ""If you're applying for a job, and you misspell the name of the company you want to work for, you won't get that job. #Amercia,"" wrote a Twitter user. ""#Amercia"" was a trending topic (meaning it's one of the most discussed terms) on Twitter late Tuesday and again Wednesday morning. The typo has already also inspired its own Tumblr blog, ""Amercia Is With Mitt."" It features photos created with the app and, as of Wednesday morning, included a group of spelling bee champions, Beaker from ""The Muppet Show"" and Rich Uncle Moneybags, the Monopoly mascot, among its subjects. And numerous images were popping up on Instagram -- one highlight being Bart Simpson having to write the correctly spelled ""America"" during his iconic chalkboard gag from the intro to ""The Simpsons."" To be honest, the Romney camp is probably more pleased at winning enough delegates in the Texas primaries Tuesday to make him the unofficial GOP nominee than it is worried about a spelling gaffe. And it's worth noting that lots of folks who support Romney probably only learned that the app exists because of talk about the typo.","Romney iPhone app goes viral with misspelled ""Amercia""

"Mariam ""Mimi"" Bell, a Latina Republican from Colorado, resents the implication that Hispanic voters are somehow negatively affected by the state's new voter identification law. ""It's insulting when they say we're going to disenfranchise the Hispanics,"" Bell said of the law that requires voters to present an ID such as a driver's license, passport, utility bill or birth certificate to vote. The suggestion, Bell said, is ""because we're Hispanics we're inept to get an ID."" The debate over the wave of voter identification laws cropping up in more than 30 states is playing out against the backdrop of the 2012 general election's high-profile fight for Latino voters. The impact of the 'Latino vote' beyond Texas . The two presidential candidates hold widely divergent views on the matter. Likely Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has spoken out in favor of voter identification laws in such places as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Opnion: GOP's problem with Latinos -- as big as Texas . During a campaign stop last month with Romney in Pennsylvania, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American Republican, blew off what he sees as overhyped concerns about showing photo IDs. People have to show IDs for everything from boarding a flight to renting sports equipment, Rubio reasoned, so why not voting. ""What's the big deal? What is the big deal?"" Rubio asked. The Brennan Center for Justice, a legal think tank at New York University School of Law that has criticized many of the new voter identification laws as costly and discriminatory, said that 11% of eligible voters lack government-issued identification. Conservatives, however, challenge that estimate. The administration and President Barack Obama's re-election campaign have pushed back against the slew of new laws in swing states. The Obama campaign has also launched gottavote.org in an attempt to make sure minority and young voters affected by the laws make it to the polls. According to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll (PDF), Obama leads Romney 61% to 27% in support among registered Latino voters. Minority communities could be affectedThe debate is forcing communities across the country to confront whether worries over discrimination should trump concerns about voter fraud. For Mississippi state Sen. Derrick Simmons, his grandmother's tales of life as a black woman in the Delta region under Jim Crow are indelibly etched in his political consciousness. When Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed the state's voter photo identification measure into law this month, the move harkened back to the type of discrimination Simmons' grandmother and others faced during the tumultuous civil rights era, the state legislator said. ""It's just going to have a chilling effect,"" said Simmons, who organized minority voter pushback against the law last year. ""I look at it as a 21st-century poll tax."" According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, thirty-two states have some sort of voting identification law. Many of the states with the strictest laws are also places where, according to a Pew Hispanic Center analysis of census figures, the minority populations have mushroomed. Those states include Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas -- places that also must get Voting Rights Act clearance before enacting new laws. The Voting Rights Act gives the federal government the power to oversee any changes in voting procedures in states and jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination. Critics of the new laws see the measures as an attempt to prevent the type of high Latino and African-American voter turnout of the 2008 election. ""African-Americans experienced much higher political participation rates, much higher than any other group, including Latinos. There is a correlation between the increase in Latino birthrates and black participation rates and the states where we've seen this crackdown in voting rights,"" said Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. ""Those groups are going to find it more difficult to participate this time around."" Concerns over fraud cited . Those who support voter identification laws cite concerns over election fraud. When the Justice Department ruled against Texas' photo identification law, Gov. Rick Perry vowed to take the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court. Perry called the law ""yet another example of the Obama administration's continuing and pervasive federal overreach."" Controversial conservative filmmaker James O'Keefe said his Project Veritas found examples in North Carolina of the type of voter fraud that could be curbed by requiring proper identification. The North Carolina State Board of Elections is looking into issues raised in one of O'Keefe's videos; however, examinations by the agency and The (Raleigh) News & Observer found some of O'Keefe's assertions were incorrect. Supporters of voter identification laws said there are still valid concerns about voter fraud and its impact on the upcoming election. ""I get carded to purchase spray paint at Home Depot, antihistamines or over-the-counter drugs,"" said Jeff Rodriguez, a Latino Republican in Colorado. ""I get carded for my prescriptions and to withdraw money from my own bank. ... But politicians we hold them to a simple code of honor which ends up corrupt. Why not verify each and every vote along with the politician. These men and women are in positions of power and should be held accountable as the leaders we voted in. ""Voting should be one of the must secure and verifiable processes in the United States of America.""","At least 32 states have some form of voter ID laws on the books .

"(CNN) -- Riots from Haiti to Bangladesh to Egypt over the soaring costs of basic foods have brought the issue to a boiling point and catapulted it to the forefront of the world's attention, the head of an agency focused on global development said Monday. Bangladeshi demonstrators chant slogans against high food prices during weekend protests. ""This is the world's big story,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute. ""The finance ministers were in shock, almost in panic this weekend,"" he said on CNN's ""American Morning,"" in a reference to top economic officials who gathered in Washington. ""There are riots all over the world in the poor countries ... and, of course, our own poor are feeling it in the United States."" World Bank President Robert Zoellick has said the surging costs could mean ""seven lost years"" in the fight against worldwide poverty. ""While many are worrying about filling their gas tanks, many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs, and it is getting more and more difficult every day,"" Zoellick said late last week in a speech opening meetings with finance ministers.  Watch what world leaders are doing to solve the problem » . ""The international community must fill the at least $500 million food gap identified by the U.N.'s World Food Programme to meet emergency needs,"" he said. ""Governments should be able to come up with this assistance and come up with it now."" The White House announced Monday evening that an estimated $200 million in emergency food aid would be made available through the U.S. Agency for International Development. ""This additional food aid will address the impact of rising commodity prices on U.S. emergency food aid programs, and be used to meet unanticipated food aid needs in Africa and elsewhere,"" the White House said in a news release. ""In just two months,"" Zoellick said in his speech, ""rice prices have skyrocketed to near historical levels, rising by around 75 percent globally and more in some markets, with more likely to come. In Bangladesh, a 2-kilogram bag of rice ... now consumes about half of the daily income of a poor family."" The price of wheat has jumped 120 percent in the past year, he said -- meaning that the price of a loaf of bread has more than doubled in places where the poor spend as much as 75 percent of their income on food. ""This is not just about meals forgone today or about increasing social unrest. This is about lost learning potential for children and adults in the future, stunted intellectual and physical growth,"" Zoellick said. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also spoke at the joint IMF-World Bank spring meeting. ""If food prices go on as they are today, then the consequences on the population in a large set of countries ... will be terrible,"" he said. He added that ""disruptions may occur in the economic environment ... so that at the end of the day most governments, having done well during the last five or 10 years, will see what they have done totally destroyed, and their legitimacy facing the population destroyed also."" In Haiti, the prime minister was kicked out of office Saturday, and hospital beds are filled with wounded following riots sparked by food prices.  Watch Haitians riot over food prices » . The World Bank announced a $10 million grant from the United States for Haiti to help the government assist poor families. In Egypt, rioters have burned cars and destroyed windows of numerous buildings as police in riot gear have tried to quell protests. Images from Bangladesh and Mozambique tell a similar story. In the United States and other Western nations, more and more poor families are feeling the pinch. In recent days, presidential candidates have paid increasing attention to the cost of food, often citing it on the stump. The issue is also fueling a rising debate over how much the rising prices can be blamed on ethanol production. The basic argument is that because ethanol comes from corn, the push to replace some traditional fuels with ethanol has created a new demand for corn that has thrown off world food prices. Jean Ziegler, U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food, has called using food crops to create ethanol ""a crime against humanity."" ""We've been putting our food into the gas tank -- this corn-to-ethanol subsidy which our government is doing really makes little sense,"" said Columbia University's Sachs. Former President Clinton, at a campaign stop for his wife in Pennsylvania over the weekend, said, ""Corn is the single most inefficient way to produce ethanol because it uses a lot of energy and because it drives up the price of food."" Some environmental groups reject the focus on ethanol in examining food prices. ""The contrived food vs. fuel debate has reared its ugly head once again,"" the Renewable Fuels Association says on its Web site, adding that ""numerous statistical analyses have demonstrated that the price of oil -- not corn prices or ethanol production -- has the greatest impact on consumer food prices because it is integral to virtually every phase of food production, from processing to packaging to transportation."" Analysts agree the cost of fuel is among the reasons for the skyrocketing prices. Another major reason is rising demand, particularly in places in the midst of a population boom, such as China and India. Also, said Sachs, ""climate shocks"" are damaging food supply in parts of the world. ""You add it all together: Demand is soaring, supply has been cut back, food has been diverted into the gas tank. It's added up to a price explosion."" E-mail to a friend .","Rise in food prices is ""the world's big story,"" development official warns .

"The Polish prime minister on Wednesday reacted strongly to what the White House said was a mistake by President Barack Obama during a Medal of Freedom ceremony. The trouble came Tuesday when Obama paid tribute to Jan Karski, the former Polish officer who escaped Nazi imprisonment in World War II and provided firsthand accounts to the Western Allies of atrocities. Karski received the award posthumously. ""Before one trip across enemy lines, resistance fighters told him that Jews were being murdered on a massive scale, and smuggled him into the Warsaw Ghetto and a Polish death camp to see for himself. Jan took that information to President Franklin Roosevelt, giving one of the first accounts of the Holocaust and imploring to the world to take action,"" Obama said. The president's use of the term ""Polish death camp,"" rather than Nazi death camp sparked outrage in Poland. Obama's words ""touched all Poles,"" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in a statement. ""We always react in the same way when ignorance, lack of knowledge, bad intentions lead to such a distortion of history, so painful for us here in Poland, in a country which suffered like no other in Europe during World War II. ""We cannot accept such words even if they are spoken by the leader of a friendly power -- or perhaps especially in such situations -- since we expect diligence, care and respect from our friend on issues of such importance as World War II remembrance."" The White House issued a statement from National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor on the president's wrong word choice. ""The president misspoke -- he was referring to Nazi death camps in Poland,"" the statement said. ""We regret this misstatement, which should not detract from the clear intention to honor Mr. Karski and those brave citizens who stood on the side of human dignity in the face of tyranny."" White House spokesman Jay Carney echoed that message in comments to reporters Wednesday. ""On several occasions -- including his visit last year to the Warsaw Ghetto memorial, his remarks at the Holocaust Museum just last month and his video message at the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz -- President Obama has paid tribute to the terrible loss of innocent Poles in Nazi death camps during the Holocaust. ""Again, we regret the misstatement, but that's what it was."" Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski tweeted Tuesday night: ""White House apologizes for outrageous blunder. PM Tusk will take his position in the morning. It's a shame that this important ceremony was overshadowed by ignorance and incompetence."" Tusk said Wednesday the incident could pose an opportunity for the United States ""to support Poland in its efforts towards historical truth, towards the correct phrasings, the right assessment of what happened during World War II on Polish territory and throughout Europe. ... When someone says 'Polish death camps,' it is as if there were no Nazis, no German responsibility, as if there was no Hitler -- that is why our Polish sensitivity in these situations is so much more than just simply a feeling of national pride."" Tusk said he is convinced that ""our American friends are capable of a stronger reaction ... than just the correction itself and the regret which we heard from the White House spokesperson. ""We take note of these words, but it seems that it would be even more important for the United States than for Poland to end this with class. This is how one acts with regard to tried-and-tested friends, but this is also how one acts in your own, well-defined interest."" Obama has spoken of the bravery of Poles during World War II in past speeches. Last year, he visited the Warsaw Ghetto Memorial honoring those who perished in the Holocaust. According to the website of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, at least 1.5 million Polish citizens were sent into forced labor in German territory between 1939 and 1945. ""Hundreds of thousands were also imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps,"" it says in its Holocaust Encyclopedia. ""It is estimated that the Germans killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians during World War II. In addition, the Germans murdered at least 3 million Jewish citizens of Poland.""","Obama spokesman: ""We regret the misstatement, but that's what it was""

"When my phone rang just a few seconds after the NCAA sanctions were handed down Monday, I knew it was someone from Penn State calling, likely outraged that our beloved university was being punished so harshly. I've received these calls all week. ""I don't think it's fair mainly because there were no violations on the field of play. There were no violations by athletes,"" said one caller, decrying the raft of penalties that will, among other things, keep the university's football program out of the post-season for four years.  ""Only by coaches and administration, all of whom are gone and facing criminal charges. ... I just feel the NCAA is pimping off the Penn State situation,"" said my friend on the phone, a former football player and current college administrator. ""What do you think?"" he asked. He was clearly upset. And, he is clearly wrong. I'm sorry. I just can't join the throngs of furious Nittany Lions. My outrage is too focused on a university that failed us and, more importantly, all of the boys who were raped and abused by former coach Jerry Sandusky. He was convicted last month for sexually assaulting 10 boys over more than 10 years, while everyone, according to the Freeh report on the scandal -- coaches, administrators and Penn State's Board of Trustees, sat back and let it happen. Too afraid to ask any questions, too afraid to lose their careers, too selfish to care about anything but football and the big money it represented. What do I think, my friend? I think the NCAA sanctions are not only fair but also could have been harsher. Arguing that the NCAA overstepped its bounds and has no right to butt into this criminal case is ridiculous. That is the same type of legal-loophole thinking that Joe Paterno, Mike McQueary and other top officials who knew about Sandusky's behavior used when they ""followed the letter of the law"" and reported to their superiors that Sandusky may have done ""something"" to a boy in the shower that awful night in 1998. They reported this suspected rape to their bosses and then went home. I think we got off easy. But to hear the indignant reaction of those in the Penn State family and in the media, you would think that the NCAA was shutting down the entire university. I just don't get it. We are talking about a university -- not one man, many men and women, an entire culture -- that allowed a former coach to repeatedly rape and abuse boys for decades on university property and school trips. Penn State alum: 'We are more than this tragedy' We are talking about a university (not just a football program) that covered up these crimes, allowing the football program to become a safe haven for a child rapist. It is a university and the entire culture around Happy Valley that happily saw no evil, heard no evil and spoke no evil as long as the profits were rolling in and the stadium seats were filled. And now we all have to pay the penalty for allowing that culture to fester. I'm willing to believe the board of trustees also realizes we got off easy, considering how quickly it agreed not to appeal any of the NCAA sanctions. Small wonder. Said the Freeh report: ""The board also failed in its duties to oversee the president and senior university officials in 1998 and 2001 by not inquiring about important university matters and by not creating an environment where senior university officials felt accountable."" That is why it is time to clean house on the board. Any board member who sat back, asked no questions or failed to demand on the record that university President Graham Spanier be more accountable to his bosses — that would be the board itself -- needs to step down. According to the university's alumni website, trustees have ""complete responsibility for the government and welfare of the university and all the interests pertaining thereto including students, faculty, staff and alumni."" Is there any doubt that the current lame-duck board miserably failed in its job? It is a positive step that the board commissioned the Freeh's report, but they must still be held to account for leading our university down a path of destruction. If we are going to clean house in the football program -- and we are not quite done there -- then, next, every trustee who sat silent on that board since 1998 should also be asked to leave. If this were any other board (corporate or nonprofit) there would be angry calls from constituents and sponsors for resignations. Well, we who are Penn State are the constituents and sponsors. Board members are entrusted with the care of the university. They are the gatekeepers. And believe me, board service is not for the weak or cowardly. I've sat on many boards; the work is hard, especially since members generally depend on the president of the organization to keep them informed. But that is not a board member's only role. The trustee website also states that the board: ""...has a continuing obligation to require information or answers on any university matter with which it is concerned."" In other words, your job as a trustee is to always ask the tough questions, do your homework and examine the facts around issues pertaining to the well-being of the university. Sometimes, it means that you have to confront an arrogant bully. Sometimes that bully is your president. To do anything less is a failure to the organization you serve. Even after the board was updated about the Sandusky investigation in May 2011, several trustees recalled in the Freeh Report, no one asked tough questions. Several present at that meeting recalled that after a three- to five-minute meeting on Sandusky and the grand jury investigation, ""the university did not appear to focus on the investigation."" It did not seem that important to Penn State. Weak leaders put their own agenda and profits before all else. These people do not deserve to serve on the board. Our house is still dirty and we need to finish cleaning up so we can all once again proudly proclaim: . We are ... Penn State.","Roxanne Jones: Some Penn Staters outraged at post-Sandusky NCAA penalties .

"When SpongeBob SquarePants skips onto shelves in boxes of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese next year, he may be a little less, well, yellow than your kids are used to. Kraft has revamped its character-shaped product line for 2014, according to company spokeswoman Lynne Galia. The new versions will have six additional grams of whole grains, be lower in sodium and saturated fat, and will use spices instead of artificial food dyes to recreate the pasta's famous yellow-orange color. ""Parents have told us that they would like fun Mac & Cheese varieties with the same great taste, but with improved nutrition,"" Galia said in an e-mail. The company will remove Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 from boxes containing pasta shaped like SpongeBob SquarePants and those with Halloween and winter shapes. Two new shapes of the popular pasta -- Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" from Dreamworks -- will also be free of food coloring, Galia said. Check out Eatocracy's recipe for homemade Mac & Cheese . The Center for Science in the Public Interest hailed Kraft's decision on Friday. Michael Jacobson, the center's executive director, said he is pleased with the announcement but is ""puzzled"" as to why Kraft would not change its iconic elbow-shaped macaroni product as well. ""As Kraft has today shown, it is clearly possible to make macaroni and cheese without these harmful chemicals,"" Jacobson said in a statement. The company tries to offer a wide variety of choices to consumers, Galia responded. ""Making ingredient changes isn't as simple as it would seem,"" she said. ""All of the ingredients must work together to deliver the distinctive taste, appearance and texture consumers expect and love from Original KRAFT Mac & Cheese. Our fans have made it clear they won't settle for anything less."" In Europe, foods with Yellow No. 5 are required to include a warning label that says, ""This product may have adverse effect on activity and attention in children."" Instead of adding this label on its products, Kraft chose to remove the artificial dyes from its European line, and uses paprika and beta-carotene to add color. The company has not make the same change in the United States. That ""double standard"" is what convinced Food Babe blogger Vani Hari to start a Change.org petition to convince Kraft to remove these dyes from all of the company's products. ""We recently discovered that several American products are using harmful additives that are not used -- and in some cases banned -- in other countries,"" Hari wrote on the petition. Yellow No. 5 has been linked to hyperactivity, asthma, some skin conditions and cancer, but larger scientific studies have proved inconclusive. Could our favorite food flavorings damage our DNA? The Food and Drug Administration must approve color additives in the United States; Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 were approved for use in foods in 1969 and 1986, respectively. More than 348,000 people have signed Hari's petition, and she delivered the electronic signatures to Kraft headquarters in April. She met with a public relations representative, but said she left the meeting feeling unsatisfied. Since then she has dedicated her time to pressuring the company to change. Thousands of parents have sent her letters, she said, talking about the behavioral changes they've seen in their kids since they removed artificial dyes from their diets. Hari doesn't have children herself, but she has two nephews that she worries about. ""When I do have kids,"" she said, ""I want to have a food system that I trust."" Hooray for healthier mac n' cheese! Hari is thrilled that Kraft is going to alter its new line, but says there is more work to do. Other companies have removed artificial dyes from their products overseas without doing the same in America, she says. There's another campaign on Change.org asking Mars Inc. to remove the additives from M&M's. Jacobson urged parents to continue signing Hari's petition on Change.org. ""As long as the Food and Drug Administration remains perched up in the bleachers and not on the playing field, action on the part of the consumers is the only thing that will get these companies' attention,"" he said.","Kraft will remove artificial food dyes from its new pasta shape varieties .
Certain pasta shapes marketed to children will not include Yellow No. 5 and 6 .

"Traitor or patriot? Low-level systems analyst or highly trained spy? Slammed by top U.S. government officials and facing espionage charges in the United States, former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden defended his decision to leak documents about classified surveillance programs during an interview with NBC ""Nightly News"" broadcast Wednesday. ""I think it's important to remember that people don't set their lives on fire,"" Snowden said. ""They don't walk away from their extraordinarily, extraordinarily comfortable lives ... for no reason."" Speaking to anchor Brian Williams in a Moscow hotel, Snowden said he considers himself a patriot, and he wouldn't have gone to such lengths to reveal secret U.S. government surveillance programs if he didn't have to. ""The reality is, the situation determined that this needed to be told to the public. The Constitution of the United States had been violated on a massive scale,"" Snowden told Williams. ""Now, had that not happened, had the government not gone too far and overreached, we wouldn't be in a situation where whistleblowers were necessary."" 10 things we learned from his interview . The U.S. government, Snowden said, is using the threat of terrorism ""to justify programs that have never been shown to keep us safe but cost us liberties and freedoms that we don't need to give up and our Constitution says we shouldn't give up."" NSA analysts, he said, ""can actually watch people's Internet communications, watch their Internet correspondence, watch their thoughts as they type,"" he said, describing such government surveillance as an ""extraordinary intrusion ... into the way you think."" He didn't specify when such a program would be used by the agency, but said seeing that program when he worked for the NSA astonished him. Snowden has been living for nearly a year in Russia, where the government has granted him temporary asylum. But he stressed he has no ties with the Russian government. ""I have no relationship with the Russian government at all,"" he told NBC. ""I've never met the Russian President. I'm not supported by the Russian government. I'm not taking money from the Russian government. I'm not a spy."" In fact, Snowden said, he never planned to stay in Russia. ""I personally am surprised that I ended up here,"" he said. ""The reality is I never intended to end up in Russia. I had a flight booked to Cuba onwards to Latin America, and I was stopped because the United States government decided to revoke my passport and trap me in the Moscow airport."" He hasn't been able to leave Russia since then. Snowden said he would eventually like to return to the United States. ""If I could go anywhere in the world, that place would be home,"" he told NBC. Asked by Williams whether he considers himself a patriot, Snowden didn't hesitate. ""Yes, I do,"" he said. That comment drew a sharp response from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who spoke with the network earlier Wednesday. ""Patriots don't go to Russia. They don't seek asylum in Cuba. They don't seek asylum in Venezuela. They fight their cause here,"" Kerry told NBC. ""Edward Snowden is a coward. He is a traitor. And he has betrayed his country. And if he wants to come home tomorrow to face the music, he can do so."" In another excerpt from the interview, Snowden sought to bolster his credentials, arguing that the U.S. government has tried to downplay his skills and work experience. ""I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word -- in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not -- and even being assigned a name that was not mine,"" Snowden said. ""Now, the government might deny these things. They might frame it in certain ways, and say, oh, well, you know, he's a low-level analyst. ""But what they're trying to do is they're trying to use one position that I've had in a career, here or there, to distract from the totality of my experience, which is that I've worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, undercover, overseas. ""I've worked for the National Security Agency, undercover, overseas. And I've worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency as a lecturer at the Joint Counterintelligence Training Academy, where I developed sources and methods for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world."" Snowden continued: ""So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading."" A spokeswoman for the NSA declined to comment Tuesday on the NBC report. What Snowden leaked sparked a national debate about privacy and security. President Barack Obama and military officials remain in support of mass, warrantless surveillance. But civil libertarians, technology companies and others oppose it, noting the lack of transparency.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Iran remains a danger to the world even though it stopped a program to develop a nuclear weapon four years ago, President Bush said Tuesday. President Bush tells reporters Tuesday that Iran still poses a threat to the world. ""Iran was dangerous, Iran is dangerous and Iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon,"" Bush said, pointing out that Tehran continues to try to enrich uranium for civilian purposes and therefore develop technology that could be used for a weapon. A declassified summary of a National Intelligence Estimate released by the U.S. government on Monday said Iran had stopped working toward a nuclear weapon in 2003 and is unlikely to be able to produce enough enriched uranium for a bomb until at least 2010. Enriched uranium at low concentrations can be used to fuel nuclear power plants, but much higher concentrations are needed to yield a nuclear explosion. The new estimate is less severe than a 2005 report that judged the Iranian leadership was ""determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure."" Earlier Tuesday, Iran ripped the Bush administration for rhetoric that came before Monday's release of the estimate. ""U.S. officials have so far inflicted ... damage on the Iranian nation by spreading lies against the country and by disturbing public opinion, therefore, they have to pay the price for their action,"" Iranian government spokesman Gholam-Hossein Elham is quoted as saying on the Web site of the official Islamic Republic News Agency. In another posting, IRNA called the updated estimate ""a necessary and positive step in Tehran-Washington relations, but undoubtedly is not sufficient."" ""The U.S. administration should know that only admitting a mistake is not enough,"" the IRNA report said. But Bush said Tuesday he saw the latest estimate on Iran as ""a warning signal.""  Watch why Bush says he sees a danger in the report » . ""What's to say they couldn't start another covert nuclear weapons program?"" Bush asked. The latest estimate shows ""Iran needs to be taken seriously as a threat to peace,"" Bush said.  See how the 2005 and 2007 estimates differ » . U.S. national security adviser Stephen Hadley said Monday that Iran remains a serious threat. ""We have good reason to continue to be concerned about Iran developing a nuclear weapon even after this most recent National Intelligence Estimate,"" he said. ""In the words of the NIE, quote, Iranian entities are continuing to develop a range of technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons, if a decision is made to do so."" Hadley said U.S. policy toward Iran has not changed because of the new report. ""If we want to avoid a situation where we either have to accept Iran ... with a path to a nuclear weapon, or the possibility of having to use force to stop it, with all the connotations of World War III -- then we need to step up the diplomacy, step up the pressure, to get Iran to stop their so-called civilian uranium enrichment program,"" he said. ""That's our policy going forward -- no change."" Britain on Tuesday also called for continued pressure on Iran. ""The report confirms that we were right to be worried about Iran seeking to develop nuclear weapons, and it also shows that the sanctions program and international pressure were having some effect,"" a spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak echoed Bush's comments Tuesday. ""Iran is a main threat to the world and Israel,"" Barak said. ""The entire world and the state of Israel should prepare to deal with this threat and thwart it."" Iran has insisted its nuclear program is strictly aimed at producing electricity, and the country has refused the U.N. Security Council's demand to halt its enrichment program. Iran's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Ali Asghar  Soltanieh, said Tuesday that even the allegations that Tehran was pursuing a nuclear weapon up to 2003 were false. ""I categorically reject any allegation that Iran has had before, has now and will have [such a program] because a nuclear weapon is not in our defense decree,"" Soltanieh said. ""We are of the belief that a nuclear weapon would create a vulnerability and therefore we are and have and will be against nuclear weapons,"" he said. The IAEA, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, has reported that Iran is cooperating with inspectors by providing access to declared nuclear material, documents and facilities. However, the agency also said Iran is withholding information in other areas, and as a result, the IAEA's knowledge about the status of the program is ""diminishing."" Iran says its uranium enrichment work is allowed under the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty. The U.N. Security Council has passed two rounds of sanctions against Tehran, but Washington missed its goal of reaching consensus on tighter restrictions by the end of November, the State Department said last week.

"It was one small interview for astronaut Neil Armstrong ... and one giant scoop for an Australian accountant, of all people. In the year's most out-of-this-world get, the first man to step foot on the moon sat down with CPA (Certified Practicing Account) Australia's Alex Malley to narrate his historic lunar landing in an extremely rare interview. Armstrong was the commander of NASA's three-man Apollo 11 mission that landed on the moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin spent about two hours on the surface before returning to the Eagle lunar module. The 81-year old American is famously reluctant to discuss the moon landing and has granted very few interviews in the last 40 years -- so why choose to open up to CPA Australia? Malley thinks he knows the answer. ""I knew something a lot of people didn't know about Neil Armstrong -- his dad was an auditor,"" said Malley in the first of the four part interview with Armstrong posted on the CPA website. In the 45-minute interview Commander Armstrong discussed his childhood in Ohio, walking on the moon, and what it's like to sleep on a spaceship. Armstrong also recounts the moment he got the call to ask him if his crew were ready to land on the moon. ""The bosses asked, 'Do you think you and your guys are ready?"" Armstrong recalled. ""I said it'd be nice to have another month, but we're in a race here and we had to take the opportunity when we had it. I had to say we are ready, we are ready to go."" ""I thought we had a 90% chance of getting back safely to Earth on that flight, but only a 50-50 chance of making a successful landing on the first attempt."" Armstrong also details the crew's harrowing 12-minute descent to the moon, when he realized that the Eagle lunar module's auto-pilot was preparing to land the crew on the slope of a huge moon crater. ""The computer showed us where it intended to land, and it was a very bad location, on the side of a large crater about 100-150m in diameter with very steep slopes covered with very large boulders -- not a good place to land at all,"" he said. Armstrong took over the craft manually and managed to land it like a helicopter in a smoother area to the west with just 20 seconds of fuel left. ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,"" were Armstrong's words to mission control on earth. As for ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,"" Armstrong says he didn't think of those immortal words until after they'd landed safely. The first few moments when Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the Eagle and onto the surface of the moon were tender, he remembers. ""We recognized that we wouldn't have been there if it hadn't been for our competitors in the Soviet Union -- it was a competition that made both of our programs able to do what we achieved. We put medallions for our fallen colleagues on both sides, and that was a tender moment."" Armstrong laughed off the conspiracy theorists who believe the 1969 moon landing was faked, telling CPA Australia's Malley that ""800,000 staff at NASA couldn't possibly keep a secret."" ""People love conspiracy theories, but it was never a concern to me -- because I know one day someone's going to go fly back up there and pick up that camera I left,"" he said. As for the future direction of space travel, Armstrong worries about cuts to NASA's budget, and says the space program remains an important source of motivation for young Americans. NASA's 2013 budget for the exploration of Mars was cut by 38%, and the budget for planetary exploration overall was reduced by $300 million -- a major concern, according to Armstrong. ""NASA's been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achive, and it's sad that we are turning the program in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation it provides to young people.""

"(CNN) -- A North Korean rocket slated for launch sometime early next month can be clearly seen in a satellite photograph taken Sunday, the Institute for Science and International Security said Sunday. The latest satellite image shows a rocket sitting on its launch pad in the north east of the country. The satellite imagery, obtained by the ISIS from DigitalGlobe, is said to show the rocket at the Musudan-ri launch site in northeastern North Korea. The image casts a shadow on the ground below. CNN could not independently confirm the information provided by the institute, led by former U.N. nuclear inspector David Albright. Defense Department officials were not immediately available for comment. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sunday there is little doubt that the planned launch is designed to bolster that North Korea's military capability. He also indicated that the U.S. military could be prepared to shoot down a North Korean missile if the rogue regime develops the capability to reach Hawaii or the western continental United States in a future launch. The North Korean government says it will launch a commercial satellite atop a rocket sometime between April 4 and April 8. ""I don't know anyone at a senior level in the American government who does not believe this technology is intended as a mask for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile,"" Gates said during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday."" Gates noted that while the United States believes it is North Korea's ""long-term intent"" to add a nuclear warhead to any such missile, he ""personally would be skeptical that they have the ability right now to do that."" Japan recently mobilized its missile defense system -- an unprecedented step -- in response to the planned North Korean launch, Japanese officials said. The move, noteworthy for a country with a pacifist constitution, is aimed at shooting down any debris from the launch that might fall into Japanese territory. In a concurrent response, U.S. Navy ships capable of shooting down ballistic missiles are being moved to the Sea of Japan, a Navy spokesman said Thursday. Gates said that the U.S. military could shoot down ""an aberrant missile, one that was headed for Hawaii ... or something like that, we might consider it, but I don't think we have any plans to (do) anything like that at this point."" He does not believe North Korea currently has the technology to reach Alaska or Pacific coast. Gates said that impending missile launch is a clear demonstration of the failure of the recent six-party talks to disarm the North Korean regime. ""It's very troubling. The reality is that the six-party talks really have not made any headway any time recently,"" he said. ""If (the missile launch) is Kim Jong-Il's welcoming present to a new president ... it says a lot about the imperviousness of this regime in North Korea to any kind of diplomatic overtures."" Gates said that he believes economic sanctions are the best tool to getting countries like North Korea and Iran to the negotiating table. Both countries are believed by the United States and other Western nations to be trying to acquire a nuclear capability.","Satellite imagery shows rocket at launch site in northeastern North Korea .

"Courting yet more controversy, Dennis Rodman on Wednesday led a singalong of ""Happy Birthday"" to the leader of North Korea, a man he calls a friend and a ""very good guy,"" but considered by many a brutal dictator who recently lauded the execution of his own uncle. Images released by The Associated Press also show Rodman appearing to bow to Kim Jong Un at Pyongyang Indoor Stadium, the site of a basketball exhibition Wednesday -- Kim's birthday -- between a North Korean team and Rodman's squad of former NBA players and others. ""It was, as you might imagine, a bizarre and unusual occasion that won't easily be forgotten,"" Simon Cokerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, said in a YouTube video posted after he accompanied tourists to watch the match. Even before Wednesday's spectacle -- in which his team lost to a North Korean squad 47-39, according to North Korean state media -- Rodman's visit to North Korea had already generated enormous controversy. The colorful former NBA star known as ""The Worm"" elicited widespread condemnation Tuesday when he suggested in an exclusive interview with Chris Cuomo of CNN's ""New Day"" that American Kenneth Bae had done something to deserve his 15-year sentence. On Wednesday, Bae's family accused Rodman of ""playing games"" with Bae's life. Relatives and U.S. officials have insisted Bae committed no crime. ""There is no diplomacy, only games, and at my brother's expense,"" Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said Wednesday in a prepared statement. Bae, described by family members as a devout Christian who ran a legal tour operation in North Korea, was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2012 on charges that he planned an operation to topple North Korea's government through religious activities. The regime also accused Bae of urging people to carry out ""hostile acts"" against the state. The married father of three has suffered a series of health problems during his detention and has been transferred from a labor camp to a hospital. Bae from North Korean prison: Please help me . Bae's relatives say Rodman, who once urged Kim in a tweet to ""do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose,"" could have helped put pressure on the North Korean government to release him. Instead, she said he made the situation worse in his Tuesday CNN interview by intimating that Bae was guilty. ""Do you understand what he did in this country?"" Rodman asked Cuomo. ""No, no, no, you tell me, you tell me. Why is he held captive here in this country, why?"" Chung said Wednesday she was shocked by his statements. ""Dennis Rodman could do a lot of good by advocating for Kenneth to Kim Jong Un, but instead he has decided to hurl outrageous accusations at my brother, insinuating that Kenneth has done something sinister,"" Chung said. 'A lot of showboating' Rodman's trip to North Korea is his fourth in the past year. Wednesday's match took place at Pyongyang Indoor Stadium, according to Cokerell, whose company stages tours for Western visitors to North Korea. Rodman, NBA old-timers arrive in North Korea . After Kim emerged to cheering crowds that for several minutes wished him long life -- ending only when the leader hushed them -- Rodman gave an impromptu speech, then he led the crowd in singing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kim. Rodman's squad and a North Korean team played two games, Cokerell said. The first featured his team in a 20-minute match in a loss against the North Korean squad. The second game pitted squads with Western and North Korean players on each team, he said. ""That game was actually much better; there was a lot of showboating, showing off, alley-oops, slam-dunks and that sort of thing,"" he said. Controversial friendship . Rodman struck up a friendship with Kim in February, when he first traveled to North Korea with a team of Harlem Globetrotters for an exhibition game. He has since described Kim as a ""very good guy"" and his friend. ""I love my friend,"" Rodman said Tuesday in a reference to Kim. ""This is my friend."" Rodman has described his series of trips to North Korea as a ""basketball diplomacy"" project and defended the latest trip in his interview with Cuomo, saying it was a ""great idea for the world."" Much of the rest of the world, however, has been less enthusiastic. Western governments and human rights groups have accused North Korea of human rights abuses, including arbitrary detentions and operating a network of labor camps -- including one to which Bae was reportedly sentenced before his health deteriorated. Kim is also believed to have led a purge that culminated in the execution of his uncle, who had been instrumental in leading the current leader to power after the death of his father. U.S. officials have taken pains to note that Rodman is on a private visit. On Tuesday, Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also criticized Rodman's comments. Richardson, a former New Mexico governor who has visited North Korea multiple times, said Rodman ""drank a little bit too much of the Kool-Aid from the North Koreans."" Charles D. Smith, a basketball player who accompanied Rodman on the trip, apologized for ""the storm that has been created by our presence."" But, he added, ""We're not apologizing for doing what we do ... we're connecting people to basketball and people to people."" When celebrity meets brutality . NBA unimpressed . The NBA also has distanced itself from Rodman's trip. ""Dennis will be Dennis, but I think there is a lot at stake here in terms of a  ... a very dangerous country,"" outgoing NBA Commissioner David Stern said Tuesday on ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" The NBA has had preliminary discussions with Pyongyang about a cultural exchange, Stern said. But he said he wouldn't send any players to North Korea without White House approval. ""Sports diplomacy is a wonderful thing,"" he said. ""But they should be done in a far more dignified fashion than this particular trip is being carried out.""

"Little more than a week after it suspended ""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson for incendiary remarks about homosexuality, the cable channel A&E said Friday that it would include him in future tapings of the reality television show, effectively lifting the suspension amid a flurry of petitions in support of Robertson. ""After discussions with the Robertson family, as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups, A&E has decided to resume filming Duck Dynasty later this spring with the entire Robertson family,"" the channel said in a statement. In an apparent gesture to the advocacy groups, A&E said that it would ""also use this moment"" to broadcast public service announcements ""promoting unity, tolerance and acceptance among all people."" Robertson's son Willie wrote on Twitter on Friday evening, ""Back to work!!! So proud of all the fans of the show and family. Ole Phil may be a little crude but his heart is good. He's the Real Deal!"" The announcement came nine days after A&E originally suspended Robertson. It was immediately perceived as a victory by some of the conservative groups that had protested the suspension. One headline on the influential Drudge Report on Friday evening was ""A&E CAVES""; another read, ""Gay Activists Group Delivered Stinging Defeat."" Chris Stone, founder of Faith Driven Consumer, the group that gathered 260,000 signatures on a petition at IStandWithPhil.com, said in a Friday night statement that he and individuals like him would ""remain vigilant as we measure whether A&E's actions reflect true tolerance, diversity, and mutual respect -- including their equal embrace of our biblically based values and deeply held beliefs."" The comments from Stone and other advocates signaled that ""Duck Dynasty"" has become a weapon in the culture wars -- and will continue to be. A&E said on December 18 that it was placing Robertson ""under hiatus from filming indefinitely"" due to the cast member's controversial comments to a GQ magazine interviewer. When the interviewer asked Robertson what he thought was sinful, he replied, ""Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."" Robertson used language that his family later described as ""coarse."" At one point he remarked that ""it seems like, to me, a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man's anus. That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes!"" Furthermore, Robertson said that when he was growing up in Louisiana in the pre-civil rights era, ""I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once."" He continued, ""Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field. ... They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people' -- not a word! Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues."" When the comments were published by GQ, gay rights groups, including GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), and civil rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, alerted A&E. The channel moved quickly to express disappointment in the comments and put Robertson on the bench. But it said the action wouldn't affect any previously taped episodes of the hugely popular reality show. One season's worth of episodes featuring Robertson had already been taped, so the suspension would only have affected future tapings in 2014. An assortment of conservative and religious groups immediately and loudly protested the suspension decision by A&E, which is jointly owned by The Walt Disney Company and Hearst. Speculation ensued about whether ""Duck Dynasty"" would come to an end, at least on A&E. Some advocates said they hoped that a channel with overtly religious values would rescue the show. The Robertson family stoked the speculation by issuing a statement that said, ""We have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm. We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of 'Duck Dynasty.'"" Inside A&E, a sudden end to ""Duck Dynasty"" was never seriously contemplated. The show is enormously profitable for A&E and, executives there pointed out in private, for the Robertsons, too. (Any shopper strolling through Walmart, where the aisles are stocked with ""Duck Dynasty"" gear, would recognize that.) But A&E executives felt they had to send a message of disapproval after seeing Robertson's comments to GQ, partly because some of the channel's own staffers were offended by the interview. The suspension announced on December 18 sent that message -- and shortly thereafter, the channel and the Robertsons' representatives started to discuss a path forward. ""We knew we had a great partnership with the family,"" said an A&E executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because the channel and the family had agreed not to say anything publicly aside from Friday's statements. Talks between the two sides took place on Christmas Eve, paused on Christmas, and resumed on Thursday, leading to Friday's announcement. While some observers accused A&E of backing down, some of the advocacy groups that were originally dismayed by Robertson's remarks on homosexuality begged to differ. ""It's not really a reversal,"" Fred Sainz, a representative of the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN's Brianna Keilar in a telephone interview on Friday. ""We think it's actually a positive outcome, and we want to thank A&E for their attentiveness and collaboration over the course of the last few weeks."" Sainz said that his group was ""heartened"" by A&E's plans for the public service announcement campaign. A spokesman for A&E declined to comment on whether Robertson or other ""Duck Dynasty"" cast members would participate in the campaign, but the channel is said to be hopeful that at least some of the cast members will. ""We've received assurances also that the Robertson family is now open to working with African-American and (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause,"" Sainz said on CNN. ""That's been our 'ask' since Phil's comments ran in GQ, and while it's a positive step, it certainly cannot and should not be the last one."" GLAAD took a more adversarial stance, stating Friday night that ""Phil Robertson should look African American and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising Jim Crow laws and comparing gay people to terrorists. If dialogue with Phil is not part of next steps then A+E has chosen profits over African American and gay people -- especially its employees and viewers."" For supporters of groups like GLAAD, the ""Duck Dynasty"" debate was primarily about whether offensive depictions of minorities -- what GLAAD called ""vile and extreme stereotypes"" -- were acceptable in public discourse. These people said no. For supporters of Robertson, including a number of conservative politicians, the debate was about whether a deeply religious man had the right to speak freely about the tenets of his faith. These people said yes. To some degree the two sides talked past each other while the Robertson suspension became national news. Bobby Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, who suggested on December 19 that A&E did not believe in the First Amendment, said Friday that he was glad the channel's executives ""came to their senses and recognized that tolerance of religious views is more important than political correctness."" Jindal added, ""Today is a good day for the freedoms of speech and religious liberty. The left is going to have to get accustomed to the fact that it does not have a monopoly on free speech and is not the only group who is permitted to voice its opinion in the public square. The left may control Hollywood, but they don't control the hearts and minds of a majority of Americans.""","""Ole Phil may be a little crude but his heart is good,"" Willie Robertson says on Twitter .

"Washington  (CNN)  -- Five Guantanamo Bay detainees with alleged ties to the 9/11 conspiracy, including accused mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, will be transferred to New York to go on trial in civilian court, Attorney General Eric Holder announced Friday. Mohammed, Ramzi Bin al-Shibh, Walid bin Attash, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi will all be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York -- a short distance from the World Trade Center towers that were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. ""After eight years of delay, those allegedly responsible for the attacks of September 11th will finally face justice,"" Holder said. He said he expected all five to be tried together and for prosecutors to seek the death penalty. The trial would be open to the public, although some portions that deal with classified information may be closed, Holder said. ""Based on all of my experience and based on all of the recommendations and the great work and the research that has been done, I am quite confident that the outcomes in these cases will be successful,"" he said. He also expressed confidence that an impartial jury would be found ""to ensure a fair trial in New York."" Of the 2,752 people killed in the 9/11 attacks, 2,606 died when terrorists crashed two hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center towers. Holder also announced that five other detainees held at the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, will be sent to military commissions for trial. They were identified as Omar Khadr, Mohammed Kamin, Ibrahim al Qosi, Noor Uthman Muhammed and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Al-Nashiri is an accused mastermind of the deadly 2000 bombing of the USS Cole; Khadr is a Canadian charged with the 2002 murder of a U.S. military officer in Afghanistan. Khadr was 15 years old when he was captured in July 2002. Holder said a venue for the military commissions has not been set. Mohammed ""will be subject to the most exacting demands of justice,"" President Obama said Friday in Japan. ""The American people insist on it, and my administration will insist on it,"" Obama told reporters at a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. Mohammed is the confessed organizer of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon. But his confession could be called into question during trial. A 2005 Justice Department memo -- released by the Obama administration -- revealed he had been waterboarded 183 times in March 2003. The CIA has also admitted using waterboarding on al-Nashiri, the first person charged in the United States for the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S. sailors. Obama has called the technique, which simulates drowning, torture. The alleged 9/11 conspirators are among 215 men held by the U.S. military at the Guantanamo prison camp. The Obama administration has vowed to close the detention facility but acknowledges it is unlikely to happen by its self-imposed January 22, 2010, deadline. Bringing some of the world's top terror suspects to be tried in New York has already sparked outrage, as well as security concerns. ""Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is the most wanted terrorist in the world.

""The Foley courthouse could become the focus of a great deal of interest from terrorists. That's going to take a tremendous security effort."" Watch Toobin list the challenges of this trial . U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, issued a statement Friday denouncing the decision to try the 9/11 suspects as ""common criminals."" ""The attacks of September 11th were an act of war,"" Cornyn said. ""Reverting to a pre-9/11 approach to fighting terrorism and bringing these dangerous individuals onto U.S. soil needlessly compromises the safety of all Americans. Putting political ideology ahead of the safety of the American people just to fulfill an ill-conceived campaign promise is irresponsible."" Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said the decision meant Mohammed and the other defendants would be able to claim new protections, including Miranda and Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. ""America already gives terrorists more constitutional rights than any other country,"" Smith said. ""The administration should not prioritize the rights of terrorists over the rights of Americans to be safe and secure."" But Kristen Breitweiser, whose husband was killed on 9/11, said she welcomed the trial. ""Some would say New York would now be a target by allowing his [Mohammed's] trial to take place in New York, but I disagree,"" she told CNN. Breitweiser still lives in the New York area. ""It would give many of us access to attend the hearings."" She also said that for some who lost loved ones on 9/11, ""this will be our opportunity to see justice served and have our day in court. ""Our ability to prosecute terrorists successfully in open courtrooms has less to do with the our judicial process and more to do with Bush's policy on torture that will make these prosecutions more difficult,"" she said.

"For many of us, the holiday season is a time to count our blessings -- and then open our hearts and our checkbooks to those who have far less than we do.  But for a handful of extraordinary leaders, giving means something more. It means committing their entire beings to bettering the lives of others.  It means looking at the most wrenching problems all around them and saying it doesn't have to be this way.  And it means innovating -- truly leading -- to find new solutions to our oldest and most vexing challenges. Modifying the homes of disabled veterans so they can live fuller, more productive lives.  Creating vital support and transportation networks for children undergoing chemotherapy.  Providing free medical care in the jungles of Cameroon, where it's not just unattainable, it's often unheard of.  Launching a mobile computer lab to help low-income students in Palm Beach County keep up with essential, job-sustaining technologies. These are just some of the ways in which the CNN Heroes are embodying the very best of giving and philanthropy.  At a time of government dysfunction and global economic turmoil, these women and men aren't wringing their hands.  They're rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done -- quietly, courageously, all around the world. How can we support and encourage even more of these efforts?  In my time as a philanthropist, I've thought a great deal about this issue.  And I've found that while money is, of course, essential, in the end it has surprisingly little to do with effective philanthropy.  Leadership is the key ingredient.  That's why we've stopped focusing our giving on needs and started focusing it much more on leadership.  I believe the future of philanthropy depends on this shift -- on a leadership-based approach to solving our public problems. The truth is, virtually all of the more than 1.5 million nonprofits in America are trying to meet important needs.  At the Annenberg Foundation, I've rarely questioned the need of a nonprofit that came to us for help.   But need isn't enough. Need doesn't get the job done.  Need doesn't inspire others to follow your example.  Need doesn't break out of the often-stale approaches of the past.  Vision does.  True dynamism in an organization does. What do I mean when I use the word ""vision?""  I mean people like the CNN Heroes, who look at an old problem and immediately see it in a brand new way.  People who think far beyond our day-to-day crises, as important as they are, and think about how their work will shape and sustain a community for the long haul.  People who understand their work as a cause, even a calling -- and can rally others to embrace it. To me, vision is nothing less than a road map to the future.  And if you have a real vision, you can outlast and outperform those with far greater resources and support.  Which is why visionaries tend to be good philanthropic investments. Of course, vision means little if you can't run an effective nonprofit.  That's why we also look for dynamic organizations -- ones that aren't weighted down by bureaucracy and turf wars, and in particular, ones in which the board and the executive director are working hand in hand.  Without the red tape and the interoffice battles, they deliver better and more meaningful results.  It sounds simple, but you'd be surprised how elusive this can be. At the Annenberg Foundation, we don't just go looking for these kinds of strong, leadership-driven nonprofits.  We try to nurture and grow them as well.  That's why we created the Annenberg Alchemy program, which we are offering free to all current and past CNN Heroes. Alchemy has already trained over 1,400 nonprofit leaders in this country, helping them approach their work with a greater sense of vision and helping them build closer bonds between their boards and their executive management, so their effectiveness can match their level of need. So if you want your own charitable dollars to have the greatest impact, don't just write checks to a worthy cause.  Support the people and organizations that are actually leading us forward.  I believe that's the best way to create a stronger, fairer, more just world.   And that's something we can all embrace, this and every holiday season.","Wallis Annenberg: Many donate to charities, but for extraordinary leaders, giving means more .

"(CNN) -- The whistleblower website WikiLeaks said Sunday that it was under cyber attack, preventing it from posting tens of thousands of classified U.S. diplomatic cables, it said via Twitter Sunday. Despite the glitch, five international news outlets which had obtained the documents ahead of time published details of the leaked documents on their websites. The announcement of the apparent attack came shortly after the United States warned WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange that publishing the papers would be illegal and would endanger peoples' lives. The New York Times, The Guardian newspaper in England, and newspapers and magazines in three other European nations published portions of the new classified material on Sunday. The site, meanwhile, was experiencing a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack, it said. That's an effort to make a website unavailable to users, normally by flooding it with requests for data. As of 3 p.m. Sunday, the site was inaccessible. The U.S. State Department's legal adviser said Saturday that if any materials in the posting of documents by the site were provided by government officials without proper authorization, ""they were provided in violation of U.S. law and without regard for the grave consequences of this action."" WikiLeaks indicated last week that it was preparing to release a new batch of previously classified U.S. military documents. ""Next release is 7x the size of the Iraq War Logs,"" the group stated via Twitter Monday. ""Intense pressure over it for months. Keep us strong."" State Department Legal Adviser Harold Hongju Koh told Assange he was responding to a letter about the newest leak. Koh wrote that the department had spoken with representatives from The New York Times and The Guardian newspapers, and the German magazine Der Spiegel about 250,000 documents the whistleblower organization provided to them for publication. WikiLeaks said Sunday it had also given documents to El Pais in Spain and Le Monde in France. Koh described the distribution as the ""illegal dissemination of classified documents"" and said it would ""place at risk the lives of countless individuals"" -- criticisms that have been repeated by U.S. officials after past postings on the site. The information blitz from WikiLeaks is expected to offer a glimpse into the worldwide communications of the State Department and its 297 embassies, consulates and missions through what are commonly referred to as ""cables."" Koh wrote that releasing such documents could jeopardize relationships with allies, military actions and anti-terrorism operations. CNN has not had advanced access to the documents, unlike some media organizations, because the company declined to sign a confidentiality agreement with WikiLeaks.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he wants to engage President Obama in ""negotiations"" before international media, a semi-official Iranian news outlet reported on Saturday. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election last month sparked global protests and unrest in Iran. Speaking at a meeting of medical school deans, Ahmadinejad said Iran ""will soon pursue a new round of diplomatic activity"" amid a new position of strength for the Iranian government, the Iranian Student News Agency quotes him as saying. ""I will go to the United Nations and will invite Obama to negotiations,"" Ahmadinejad said, adding that such talks would be ""in front of the international media, not a sit-down behind closed doors in order to talk about matters."" The Obama administration has sought dialogue with Iran but also criticized the government for its handling of unrest after disputed presidential elections. Last week, Obama said Iran's government must justify itself not in the eyes of the United States, but in the opinion of its own people. ""A sizable percentage of the Iranian people themselves ... consider this election illegitimate,"" he said at a White House news conference. ""It is not too late for the Iranian government to recognize that there is a peaceful path that will lead to stability and prosperity."" Initially, Obama was criticized by Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina for taking a ""timid and passive"" tone in speaking out against the growing wave of arrests, violence and deaths of pro-democracy activists. Ahmadinejad said he wants others to stop ""meddling"" in the internal affairs of Iran. Iranian officials, including Ahmadinejad, claimed nations such as the United States and Britain have meddled in Iranian affairs. Last week, Ahmadinejad said officials were ""astonished"" over what they called meddling and warned of repercussions if meddling continues. ""Didn't he [Obama] say that he was after change?"" Ahmadinejad asked Iranian judiciary officials in a speech last week. ""Why did he interfere? Why did he utter remarks irrespective of norms and decorum?"" ""They keep saying that they want to hold talks with Iran,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""All right, we have expressed our readiness as well. But is this the correct way [for holding talks]?"" Meanwhile, two major political figures have been meeting family members of those detained amid post-election unrest. One was former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani -- chief of the Expediency Council and supporter of opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi, according to the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency. The other was Mehdi Karrubi, one of the opposition candidates, who reportedly paid visits to families of political detainees, according to the Etemad-e-Melli, Karrubi's newspaper. Meanwhile, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported that 20 people between the ages of 35 to 48 were executed in Iran on Saturday for ""buying, selling and holding heroin, cocaine and opium.""","Iran will pursue ""new round of diplomatic activity,"" Iranian president reportedly says .

"ISIS has been defined as the wealthiest terrorist group on record, using a combination of black market oil sales, extortion and sophisticated social media to raise money to fund its expansion into Iraq and Syria, according to the U.S. Treasury. A policy to combat ISIS on many fronts is taking shape, but western diplomats here in the Middle East say trying to get coalition members on the same page is proving difficult.  The harsh reality remains that despite an ever-increasing focus on ISIS, the group is still pulling in about $1 million a day, according to the U.S. Treasury. A dozen coalition countries led by General John Allen -- U.S. envoy in the fight against ISIS -- met in Kuwait on Monday with a two pronged strategy: to decide what are the best tools to choke off ISIS financing and to win the hearts and minds of the Muslim world in terms of messaging. Another part of this effort is getting coalition members to agree on the final goal.  Some big regional Sunni powers, specifically Saudi Arabia and Turkey, are still eager to purse a broader coalition campaign which includes taking down Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  This remains a stumbling block on the path to an effective coalition. But there are indications that a more defined strategy against ISIS has emerged over the past week.  In his address to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Thursday, the lead official on ISIS financing said progress had been made before going on to name those countries which are lagging behind. READ MORE: Former U.S. soldier battles ISIS . David Cohen, the Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the U.S. Treasury, said both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have both made progress in choking off funds from wealthy Gulf Arab trading groups that support what many defined as a broader Sunni cause in support of ISIS.  However, Cohen went onto to say both Qatar and Kuwait remain ""permissive jurisdictions for terrorist financing."" That is a strong statement considering Kuwait has set up a financial intelligence unit and Qatar passed a law regulating fundraising by charities within the tiny but wealthy Gulf state with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. Pressure on Qatar is coming from both sides of the Atlantic.  Douglas Alexander, the British Labour Party's shadow foreign secretary, said the visit of Qatar's young Emir to London this week is the ideal opportunity to apply more pressure. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister David Cameron later this week to define the efforts put forth to undermine ISIS.  The ability for the Prime Minister to lean on Qatar is complicated by the Gulf state's spending spree in London as owner of Harrods, the London Shard building and a slew of other prime assets. Meanwhile, as I reported at the beginning of September, ISIS's oil production and distribution network is not what it was just a few months ago, when up to 70,000 barrels of crude was finding its way onto the black market. Cohen from the U.S. Treasury suggests -- using his revenue number of a million dollars -- that production has been reduced to 25,000 barrels and that the Assad regime is still on the receiving end of that ISIS-controlled oil.  Now the coalition wants both the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and Turkey to close off routes used to distribute that oil.  Both have reportedly made pledges to do so.  Over the past week U.S. airstrikes are supporting an Iraqi military effort on the ground to finally secure the Baiji refinery north of Mosul. The effort to pull 60 countries of a coalition together, diplomats tell me, is as complicated as the region itself -- especially with so many countries vying for the upper hand.","ISIS, which controls parts of Iraq and Syria, is pulling in $1 million a day, says the U.S. Treasury .

"This week, the elite owners of the National Football League are considering instituting a 15-yard penalty for any NFL player caught using the N-word on the field. Noble gesture? Sure. Clueless? Absolutely. Why is it bad to demean a player of African descent, but the pejorative ""Redskins"" is still just fine for use as the name of the Washington football team? Makes no sense. As a Native American, a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation and someone who participates in the Native American community and doesn't just claim to be Native American because I have a picture somewhere of a great-grandma who had high cheekbones, I wonder: Hey NFL, why aren't you just as pissed about the R-word? I'm not black, and although I find the N-word repugnant and wrong, I'm not here to rage about it. I'm here, in fact, to make a point. Throughout the last NFL season, Native Americans diligently and consistently worked to remind the conscientious objector (not the bigot -- you can't get much into the brain of a bigot) that Redskin is a racial slur. And we, the descendants of those who survived the Founding Fathers and westward expansion and Christian boarding schools, will not sit idly by as opulent white men tell us that the R-word isn't an epithet and that it's part of their tradition. Lawmakers step into Washington Redskins name fray . Don't mistake me here, folks. Privilege in sports isn't just white. I encounter African-Americans in Redskins garb and Latinos in Cleveland Indians jerseys. In fact, this was the case last week on the D train here in New York City when, in a moment, I had enough of it all and encountered a tall black man with headphones on his ears and a Redskins lid on his skull. He was standing, and I was standing. We faced each other, backs to the sliding doors, and I remember staring and glaring at his hat, then at his eyes, then up again to his cap. It wasn't long, maybe just one stop, before he ripped his headphones off and asked me if I had a problem. ""With your hat,"" I said. ""So, yeah, I do."" He paused for a quick second and seemed a bit perplexed by my response. He probably thought I was a mad fan of a different team -- the kind of person who fights in stadium parking lots with beer in his gut and hate in his heart for any insolent denizen who dares don the logo of the visiting team. ""What a privilege,"" I continued, ""to be able to walk into a subway and not have to see someone wearing a hat with the stereotypical likeness of your people on it and a racist pejorative to accompany the image."" Opinion: Redskins needs to change . And it gets better. I was on a Canadian radio show recently discussing the utter vulgarity of the R-word when a caller said to me, ""You know, it's so trivial. It's just a word. ..."" ""But isn't 'colored' just a word, too?"" I barked. ""Would you be so audacious as to make the same argument to an African-American about that word?"" I waited for a loathsome rebuttal, but I all I got in return was dead Canadian air. So, if you're still curious ""what makes the red man red?"" (Thanks again, Disney's ""Peter Pan""), all you have to do is go to New York City and see the bevy of Christopher Columbus statues, and then go to Ohio and see the wiggy white men painted in red-face at the Cleveland Indians game and then end up back in Landover, Maryland, where the white and black and brown Washington Redskins taunt you, and then still ask: ""What's the big deal?"" Here's the big deal. It's wrong. I recently asked my Native elder in the West about what he thinks of the term. He said, ""I'm not red ... I'm pissed."" And so am I -- because if you're not pissed, you're not paying attention.

"Washington (CNN) -- Conservative commentator Glenn Beck says his weekend revival-style rally at the Lincoln Memorial was meant to reclaim the U.S. civil rights movement ""from politics,"" arguing that the movement was about ""people of faith."" Beck told Fox News, the network that carries his weekday television program, that the essence of the movement was about ""people of faith who believe you have an equal right to justice."" ""If it's not the essence, then we've been sold a pack of lies. The essence is that everyone deserves a shot -- the content of character not the color of skin,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" Beck drew a crowd that stretched six blocks down the National Mall on Saturday, but drew fire for its timing and location -- the same date and location as the 1963 March on Washington, where the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. See the view from the crowd . Handbills promoting the King-headlined event called it rally ""for jobs and freedom,"" with marchers demanding not only voting rights for African-Americans but ""full and fair employment"" and a ""decent housing."" Beck told Fox that the civil rights movement's economic agenda was ""a part of it, but that's a part of it that I don't agree with."" Beck has come under fire from civil rights leaders and other critics because of the timing of the rally and some of his previous statements, such as his 2009 that President Barack Obama ""has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture."" And earlier this year, he urged viewers to quit churches that preached ""social justice,"" a term he equated with socialism. In his Fox interview, taped after Saturday's rally, he said he regretted his remarks about Obama, but said the first African-American president's worldview was shaped by ""Marxism disguised as religion."" Beck's address to his ""Restoring Honor"" rally, nominally held in support of U.S. troops, resembled more a revival than a political rally. In it, he urged those attending to return America to the religious values on which he said it was founded. ""Something beyond imagination is happening,"" he told participants who packed the National Mall in Washington. ""America today begins to turn back to God. For too long, this country has wandered in darkness."" Park Service officials have stopped giving crowd counts after previous controversies. But an estimate commissioned by CBS News, using aerial photography, put attendance at between 78,000 and 96,000. ABC News reported more than 100,000, while Fox -- and Beck -- estimated it at above half a million. Rallies clog D.C Metro system . The Rev. Al Sharpton, who led a commemoration of the King rally's anniversary Saturday at a Washington high school, dismissed Beck's address as a ""motivational speech"" that ignored the policies King promoted. ""It might be good, but it's not civil rights,"" he told CNN. Beck also has tried to organize viewers into a ""9/12"" movement, aimed at restoring a spirit he said Americans shared after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. He told Fox that Americans ""should be looking for people with the right ideas,"" but dismissed any ambition for elected office himself. ""My feeling right now is the country is in trouble. And I don't see a political solution, because I think we're too divided. I think both parties have sold their souls,"" he said. ""And you know, our founders, if you read their speeches and their documents and their letters to each other, when they founded our country, they all said it would happen if the people turned from God. ""So let's take them as people who knew what they were talking about,"" he added.

"ZURICH, Switzerland (CNN)  -- Woody Allen, Pedro Almodovar and Martin Scorsese have ""demanded the immediate release"" of fellow filmmaker Roman Polanski, who was arrested in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant related to a 1977 child sex charge. A supporter displays a ""free Polanski"" tag on his shirt during the Zurich Film Festival. They were among 138 people in the film industry who signed a petition against the arrest. Polanski was on the way to the Zurich Film Festival when Swiss police detained him in response to the American warrant. The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor but fled before he could be sentenced. He settled in France, where he holds citizenship. Investigators in the United States say Polanski, then 43, drugged and raped a 13-year-old girl. The filmmakers objected to his being arrested en route to the film festival, which held a tribute to him this year. ""It seems inadmissible to them that an international cultural event, paying homage to one of the greatest contemporary filmmakers, is used by the police to apprehend him,"" said the petition, backed by France's Societe des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques (Society of Dramatic Authors and Composers). ""The arrest of Roman Polanski in a neutral country, where he assumed he could travel without hindrance ... opens the way for actions of which no one can know the effects,"" said the signatories, who also included actresses Monica Bellucci and Tilda Swinton and directors David Lynch, Jonathan Demme, John Landis, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Wim Wenders. In the United States, powerhouse movie producer Harvey Weinstein is trying to recruit more supporters for Polanksi. ""We are calling every filmmaker we can to help fix this terrible situation,"" his company told CNN in a statement. Polanski has filed an appeal against his extradition to the United States, Swiss authorities said. They added that they would act on the case within weeks. Polanski won an Academy Award for Best Director in 2003 for ""The Pianist."" He was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for ""Tess"" and ""Chinatown,"" and Best Writing for ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which he also directed.  See examples of Polanski's work » . On Monday, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that he hoped authorities would respect Polanski's rights ""and that the affair [will] come to a favorable resolution,"" the ministry said in a statement. The French culture and communications minister, Frederic Mitterrand, said he ""learned with astonishment"" of Polanski's arrest and expressed solidarity with Polanski's family. Polanski, 76, was arrested Saturday on his arrival at Zurich's airport. A provisional arrest warrant had been issued last week out of Los Angeles, California, after authorities learned that he was going to be in Switzerland, Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, said Sunday. In a written statement, Polanski's California counsel said Monday that ""an issue related to the Swiss extradition matter is presently being litigated before the California Court of Appeal. We had hoped that this would be determinative of this case."" ""We were unaware of any extradition being sought, and separate counsel will be retained for those proceedings."" The lawyers -- Douglas Dalton, Chad Hummel and Bart Dalton -- said prior deputy district attorneys had told them that no efforts were being made to extradite Polanski, who ""owned a home in Switzerland for many years and worked throughout Europe during that time."" There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to the United States to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man who ""drugged and raped a 13-year-old child"" to go free. The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was ""in provisional detention."" But whether he can be extradited to the United States ""can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalized,"" ministry spokesman Guido Balmer said in an e-mail. ""It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision,"" Balmer wrote. ""Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice."" Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski's sentencing, depending on what happens in Zurich. Polanski was accused of plying the teenage girl with champagne and a sliver of a Quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. Nicholson was not at home. Polanski's lawyers tried this year to have the charges thrown out, but a judge in Los Angeles rejected the request. However, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court. Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way the director's case was originally handled. According to court documents, Polanski, his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial. But the original judge in the case, who is now dead, first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing. Then, on the eve of his sentencing, the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days. Polanski fled the United States for France, where he was born. In the February hearing, Espinoza mentioned a documentary film, ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,"" that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his image would suffer if he didn't send Polanski to prison. The documentary was first broadcast in June 2008. ""It's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct,"" Espinoza said. But he declined to dismiss the case. Polanski's victim long ago came forward and made her identity public, mainly saying she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled. Samantha Geimer, now 45 and a married mother of three, sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement. She is among those calling for the case to be tossed out. In court papers filed in January, she said, ""I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim, have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception. ""Every time this case is brought to the attention of the court, great focus is made of me, my family, my mother and others. That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety, the continuation of the case.""

"I once wondered why we indigenous peoples of North America must break it down when it comes to why something is anti-Native American. On the whole, people can recognize what's anti-black, anti-gay, anti-Latino, anti-Asian, and so on: But when it comes to racism directed at Native Americans, we, the first peoples of this continent, are left having to explain why Indian mascots and painting your face red at a Cleveland Indians game denigrate us. Years of studying and observing this situation have led me to an unfortunate conclusion: People have been conditioned to ignore racism directed at Native Americans. But, I'm not sure I can consciously blame them ... at least not all of them. Think about it: Thanks to Hollywood, I'm supposed to have long hair, bronze skin and a very limited vocabulary. Courtesy of Thanksgiving and Halloween, it's possible someone might believe it's ""just in good fun"" to dress in faux Native American garb and play Indian. So when I walk in a room, nobody looks at me and sees a Native American. Why? Because people have been conditioned to believe I look, act, and even talk a certain way, and believe playing Indian is OK. Lo, it's not. So here's the solution: We are going to be seen. As social media and the web continue to grow exponentially, so too do the voice and face of Native America. The National Congress of American Indians has just launched yet another campaign to put our faces and those of our allies in the public eye. NCAI's hashtag, #ProudToBe, is a video and photo campaign that uses the web and demonstrates that we are more than a costume. We are more than a mascot. In fact, the second half of the campaign against the dehumanization of Native Americans in the form of sports mascots is aptly called ""#NotYourMascot."" And many of this nation's leaders have joined in the growing chorus of conscientious objectors who see Indian mascots for what they are: racist. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Sen. Maria Cantwell, and Washington, D.C., Councilman David Grosso have each been photographed holding signs that read ""#ProudToBe Standing With #NotYourMascot."" And, according to the folks at the National Congress of American Indians, more photos continue to stream in. Grosso, who's a Washington Redskins season ticket holder, recently told me he predicts the team name will, in fact, be abolished in the next five years. ""Ultimately we're going to have to right this wrong,"" he said. ""The word 'redskins' has never been used in a positive way. It's been a racist and a derogatory term since forever."" Sen. Reid told me: ""The degrading team name inflicts pain on Native American populations. The name is going to change; it's only a question of when. The NFL and Dan Snyder have to realize they are on the losing side of history."" Opinion: NFL may throw flag on N-word, but what about the 'R-word'? Several days ago, I was asked: ""Why are you picking on the Redskins? What about the Cleveland Indians or the Atlanta Braves?"" First, the term ""redskins"" is a pejorative, a racial slur. We are told by our elders that the eastern Algonquian word for woman is shunksqaw, and that ""squaw"" in the English usage came to signify that part of the woman the settlers wanted during negotiations. It's a pejorative. It always has been, just like the word ""redskins."" The term ""Indian"" isn't a racial slur, even though it's incorrect; and neither are the terms ""brave"" or ""warrior."" But that's missing the point. When the status of a Native American is demoted to that of a caricature, we are objectified and diminished as a people. We become entertainment, not fellow citizens. How are you supposed to take me seriously if all you see is the stereotypical image of the Hollywood or sports mascot Indian? Courtesy of the Web, we are no longer out of sight. We are no longer canceled out of the American conversation. Also, more Native Americans live in urban settings than ever before. More than 70% of us work, live and thrive in big cities. Native Americans on reservations have smartphones and laptops, so geographic isolation is slowly becoming a thing of the past as well. And we use these new technologies to speak out against the macro- and micro-aggressions directed at Native Americans. Today, we are lawyers, doctors, teachers, business owners, professional athletes, artists, and maybe your neighbor next door. We are proud to be Diné, Lakota, Choctaw, Crow, Cherokee, Ojibwe, Cheyenne, Navajo, Zuni, and many more. And so the momentum builds against the racism aimed at us, leaving the question: Will you tell your children or grandchildren you are on the side of the Native American and allies who believe we deserve the same respect afforded to others? Or will you tell them we were just a group of politically correct Indians and Indian-lovers who were infringing on other people's privilege? Right. The Redskins fan, the Indians fan, the Braves fan -- they're upset because they demand said privilege. We're upset because we demand respect.","Simon Moya-Smith: People recognize prejudice, but not against Native Americans .

"Facebook has raked in billions and will make a splash when its stock hits the open market next week. So, what are folks on Wall Street concerned about? Mark Zuckerberg's hoodie, apparently. Michael Pachter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg that the Facebook CEO's decision to show up for a meeting with potential investors dressed down in his trademark casual outerwear suggests that he's too immature to run a massive corporation. ""He's actually showing investors he doesn't care that much; he's going to be him,"" Pachter said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. ""I think that's a mark of immaturity. ""I think that he has to realize he's bringing investors in as a new constituency right now, and I think he's got to show them the respect that they deserve because he's asking them for their money."" If nothing else, Pachter's take (and he still thinks Facebook is a solid investment) reinforces the inevitable culture clash that occurs when a 27-year-old titan of California's freewheeling startup culture meets the buttoned-down world of Wall Street. It's not a new phenomenon: Zuckerberg is known for his ever-present T-shirt and sandals, and in Facebook's early days, he once showed up for a meeting with a venture-capital firm in his pajamas. Pachter went on to say that Zuckerberg might be a better product manager or designer than CEO. Needless to say, the tech world got a good laugh out of it all. The Next Web led with this not-so-subtle headline: ""Odd analyst mocks Zuck's hoodie, ironically sounding stupid in a suit while doing so."" In the article, Michael Wilhelm notes that if Zuckerberg had shown up in a suit, it could actually have signaled that Facebook was moving away from its winning formula, which could spook employees (and presumably investors) who like the way things run now. ""And finally: 'he's going to be him, and he's going to do what he's always done,'"" Wilhelm writes. ""That's to say that he's going to build a $100 billion business and change the world? That's what the hoodie signifies? Well then, I think that he shouldn't take it off at all costs!"" Tech blogger Om Malik had a more blunt take on Pachter's remarks. ""This analyst is smoking stuff that is outside the realm of legality,"" he wrote. ""Now if you were looking for a problem with Zuckerberg's hoodie, then you should see it for what it really is: a fashion abomination."" And Box CEO Aaron Levie weighed in on Twitter: ""Yahoo CEO: No hoodie; AOL CEO: No hoodie; Facebook CEO: hoodie. Coincidence?"" It's not like Zuck doesn't know how to clean up. He donned a coat and tie last year when he and other technology luminaries had dinner with President Obama, and wore a suit a few months later when Obama visited Facebook for a town hall event. In fact, he bucked the Valley Casual look for an entire year not so long ago. On his Facebook Timeline, Zuckerberg wrote that, in 2009, he wore a tie every day. ""After the start of the recession in 2008, I wanted to signal to everyone at Facebook that this was a serious year for us,"" he wrote. ""Great companies thrive by investing more heavily while everyone else is cutting back during a recession. But great companies also make sure they're financially strong and sustainable. ""My tie was the symbol of how serious and important a year this was, and I wore it every day to show this."" Maybe Zuckerberg, sitting on the verge of a blockbuster stock offering, no longer feels the need to prove himself.","Analyst says Zuckerberg showed ""immaturity"" by wearing hoodie to New York meetings .

"It's one of the NFL's bigger rivalries, the Cowboys vs. the Redskins. And intentional or not, Sunday's game occurs during Columbus Day weekend, deepening the meaning of a fresh conflict about whether ""Redskins"" slurs Indians, their leaders say. 5 predictions for Redskins vs. Cowboys . More than 500 years after Christopher Columbus' encounter with the natives of the Americas, any enduring uneasiness between Indians and mainstream society is exemplified by the controversy over the Washington Redskins name, which took a new turn last week when President Obama spoke of ""legitimate concerns"" that the mascot is racist, some Indian leaders say. Native American mascots: Pride or prejudice? Team owners strongly dispute any racism behind the mascot and won't change it, saying the Redskins name honors ""where we came from, who we are."" But many Native Americans contend it's incredulous that a major sports team in the nation's capital fails to see the word's offensiveness, especially in a game Sunday whose rival mascots conjure up the bygone real bloodshed between cowboys and Indians. Some news outlets and sports writers agree and aren't printing ""Redskin"" in their stories about the NFL team. ""After 500 years, it's pretty unbelievable that this issue is at the forefront right now,"" said Jason Begay, a Navajo who's an assistant professor and director of the Native American Journalism Project at the University of Montana.  ""Even in the last 50 years (of the civil rights movement), we learned so much. It's just ridiculous that this is an issue."" The NFL team disagrees. In response, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York began airing this weekend a radio ad protesting the Redskins mascot in the Dallas Cowboys' hometown. The ad, entitled ""Bipartisan,"" quotes how Obama, a Democrat, and Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican leader in the House, disapprove of the Redskins name. Washington team owner Dan Snyder stepped up his defense of the moniker this month. Last spring, he told USA Today he will ""never"" change the name. ""Our fans sing 'Hail to the Redskins' in celebration at every Redskins game. They speak proudly of 'Redskins Nation' in honor of a sports team they love,"" Snyder wrote in a letter to fans. ""After 81 years, the team name 'Redskins' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from, who we are, and who we want to be in the years to come,"" he continued. ""I respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name. But I hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means, not only for all of us in the extended Washington Redskins family, but among Native Americans too,"" Snyder said, citing several polls conducted in recent years that show that a majority of people do not want the name changed. But American Indians like Begay worry about the normalization of an epithet. He's also vice president of the Native American Journalists Association, which launched last month a media resource page on its website about offensive Native American mascots in U.S. sports. ""We're on the verge of laying back and letting this name run rampant when we can actually make a difference, which is what we all should be striving for,"" Begay said. ""I'm glad to see there are so many organizations like NAJA and the (U.S.) President who are standing against it."" Obama said last week that if he were the team's owner, he would ""think about changing it,"" referring to the mascot. Opinion: Obama is right about 'Redskins' Obama added that ""I don't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real, legitimate concerns that people have about these things."" The ad also airs a quote by Cole saying ""the name is just simply inappropriate. It is offensive to a lot of people."" Washington Redskins, Barack Obama & a name-changing public relations disaster . The political leaders' remarks are repeated in the radio ad advanced by the Oneida Indian Nation and its leader Ray Halbritter, who's also CEO of Oneida Nation Enterprises, which operates a casino and other businesses. Halbritter acknowledged his tribe's ""Change the Mascot"" campaign faces an uphill struggle. He refers to the mascot as ""the R-word,"" without explicitly stating it. ""Well, history is littered with people who have vowed never to change something -- slavery, immigration, women's rights -- so we think one thing that's really great about this country is when many people speak out, change can happen,"" Halbritter said. When asked about other team mascots such as the Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Chiefs and Chicago Blackhawks, Halbritter cited how ""redskin"" is defined in the Merriam-Webster Unabridged online dictionary as ""usually offensive."" ""Let's be clear. The name, the R word, is defined in the dictionary as an offensive term. It's a racial epithet. It's a racial slur. I think there is a broader discussion to be had about using mascots generally and the damage it does to people and their self-identity. But certainly there's no gray area on this issue,"" he said. Halbritter asserted the word was born out of hatred -- and referred to the long, ugly history between the native people of the Americas and the colonizers from Europe who followed Columbus. ""Its origin is hated, use is hated, it was the name our people -- that was used against our people when we were forced off our lands at gunpoint. It was a name that was used when our children were forced out of our homes and into boarding schools,"" he said. ""So, it has a sordid history. And it's time for a change, and we hope that -- and what's great is when enough people do recognize that, change will come."" Fans are sharply divided about the issue. A non-scientific online poll by the Washington Post shows 43% saying the team should change its name. But 57% say no, keep it. One respondent said the term is ""a racist holdover from another day, a time when Indians were depicted as violent, ignorant, savages (by) whites (who largely were equally violent, ignorant and savage)."" But another respondent referred to political correctness and said: ""The liberal PC society has gotten out of control, if you don't like the teams name THEN DON'T WATCH THEM...!"" Redskins attorney Lanny Davis said the mascot is ""not about race, not about disrespect."" At games, he joins fans in singing ""Hail to the Redskins"" because ""it's a song of honor, it's a song of tribute.""","The controversy over Redskins mascot heightens as team plays the Cowboys this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Less than a week after New York became the nation's sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage, Rhode Island state lawmakers on Wednesday voted in favor of a bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples. The measure, which passed the state Senate by a count of 21-16, is widely seen as a compromise intended to provide same-sex couples with added rights and benefits, while also preventing an expanded legal definition of marriage. Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, is expected to sign the bill into law, according to his spokesman, Michael Trainor. If signed, the law would take effect on July 1, making Rhode Island the fifth state in the union to allow civil unions between same-sex couples. Such unions are currently permitted in New Jersey and Illinois, and will be allowed in Delaware and Hawaii beginning January 1, 2012. Three West Coast states -- California, Oregon and Washington -- plus Nevada, also allow for ""comprehensive domestic partnerships,"" largely considered an equivalent to their civil union counterparts. Despite robust opposition to the measure, Rhode Island's Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill by a vote of 7-4, sending it to the Democrat-controlled Senate floor where lawmakers voted in its favor, according to Senate spokesman, Greg Pare. The legislation, which passed overwhelmingly in the state's lower house on May 19, affords same-sex couples a host of new state tax breaks, health-care benefits and greater ease of inheritance. But it also drew sharp criticism from religious leaders and opposition groups who say it will lead to court-ordered action that would eventually legalize same-sex marriage. Similar legal action in Connecticut and Massachusetts resulted in those states adopting same-sex marriage laws, noted Christopher Plante, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage's Rhode Island chapter. Chafee -- who is supportive of potential legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage -- says civil unions are ""a step in the right direction,"" according to Trainor. Meanwhile, gay rights activists -- like Marriage Equality Rhode Island -- say that while they support the civil union bill, they would prefer legislation that permits same-sex couples to wed. The group urged Chafee not to sign the measure if it includes a House amendment that permits groups with religious affiliations to refuse certain legal rights provided to civil unions. For instance, a hospital with a religious affiliation could refuse a civil union partner from being involved in the emergency medical care decisions of their spouse if it chose to do so, said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the activist group. Chafee is ""very aware of the concerns that have been expressed,"" Trainor said, but will likely sign the bill into law, which passed the Senate with the controversial amendment included. House spokesman Larry Berman called the issue a ""red herring,"" pursued by the state's more radical activists. The exemption, he said, is meant to provide religious protections against potential litigation. ""It's a small exception,"" Berman said, when compared to the slew of new rights and benefits same-sex couples would enjoy should the measure be signed into law. Currently, Rhode Island and Maine are the only states in New England that do not permit same-sex marriage. Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo a signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage, more than doubling the number of Americans living in states that permit such unions. The measure will take effect on July 24, providing gay and lesbian couples with new rights that include employer health benefits, easier inheritance and a host of state tax breaks. Federal recognition, however, was not a part of Friday's vote, leaving benefits like Social Security and ease of immigration largely out of reach for same-sex couples. The controversial bill passed New York's Republican-controlled Senate before reaching Cuomo's desk, in an extended legislative session that left many skeptical over whether lawmakers would bring the measure to a vote. Iowa and the District of Columbia also allow gay and lesbian couples to wed.","NEW: Senate passes bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples .

"Three Al Jazeera journalists detained for a month are among 20 people referred to Egypt's criminal court to face trial, Egyptian state media reported Wednesday. Four of the 20 defendants are foreigners: Australian Al Jazeera correspondent Peter Greste, two unidentified Englishmen and one unnamed Dutchman, state media said. The foreign nationals face charges ""of collaborating with the Egyptians (defendants) and providing them with information, equipment and money, as well as broadcasting false information and rumors to convince the international community that Egypt was undergoing a civil war."" The remaining 16 defendants are Egyptians, who face charges ""including belonging to a terrorist organization, harming national unity and social peace, and using terrorism as a means to their goals."" Egyptian authorities arrested Greste, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed of Al Jazeera English on December 29. They have been held since. Egyptian authorities say the journalists held illegal meetings with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was declared a terrorist group in December. Mohamed Fadel Fahmy's brother, Adel Fahmy, told CNN that his brother's lawyer had confirmed he was among the defendants named in a statement by Egyptian prosecutors. ""It's a big blow. We didn't think things would turn out this way, especially after all the evidence that came out against the accusations,"" Adel Fahmy said. ""We thought things were getting better, but this is taking us back to square one -- even worse."" Brother: 'We're praying and we're hoping' Adel Fahmy said the family was trying to stay strong. ""You have to always keep the hope. We're praying and we're hoping that this is just a tough period that will pass."" He said the family was particularly worried about Mohamed Fadel Fahmy because even Greste, as a foreign citizen in detention, was not getting any protection. He added, ""We have to stay positive. It's completely crazy and the situation in the country is making things worse -- the bombings, the assassinations. The government is trying to save face, but they're making things worse. They're not thinking rationally."" Greste wrote in a letter released by Al Jazeera on Saturday that his detention was an attack on media freedoms. ""How do you accurately and fairly report on Egypt's ongoing political struggle without talking to everyone involved?"" he wrote. The network did not say how it obtained the letter from Greste, who has previously worked for CNN, Reuters and the BBC. Fahmy worked for CNN and The New York Times before joining Al Jazeera. Mohamed is a Cairo-based producer for the Qatar-based network. Western leaders, human rights groups and journalists have repeatedly called on Egypt to release the men, saying their arrests were a violation of human rights and media freedoms.","Prosecutors say three detained Al Jazeera journalists are among 20 people to face trial .

"Rodney King, whose beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was caught on camera and sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved, was found dead in his swimming pool Sunday, authorities and his fiancee said. He was 47. Police in Rialto, California, received a 911 call from King's fiancee, Cynthia Kelly, about 5:25 a.m., said Capt. Randy De Anda. Responding officers found King at the bottom of the pool, removed him and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital, police said. There were no preliminary signs of foul play, De Anda said, and no obvious injuries on King's body. Police are conducting a drowning investigation, he said, and King's body would be autopsied. Rodney King: What happened in 1991 . Kelly -- who was a juror in King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles in 1994 -- told police King was an ""avid swimmer,"" but that she was not, De Anda said. She reported the two had just had a conversation and she went inside, but came back out after hearing a splash and saw him at the bottom of the pool. De Anda said he did not see any drug paraphernalia ""or anything that would indicate that Mr. King was intoxicated"" at the scene, but a toxicology screen would be performed. King's beating after a high-speed car chase and its aftermath forever changed Los Angeles, its police department and the dialogue on race in America. ""I am saddened by the death of Rodney King,"" said Bernard Parks, a Los Angeles city councilman who served as LAPD chief from 1997 to 2002. ""Although his beating will forever be thought of as one of the ugliest moments in the history of the city of Los Angeles and its police department, the victimization of Mr. King and the circumstances that followed created an atmosphere that allowed LAPD and the city to make historic disciplinary and community-based reforms that have made for a better police department and a better city as a whole."" ""Rodney King was a symbol of civil rights and he represented the anti-police brutality and anti-racial profiling movement of our time,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement. ""It was his beating that made America focus on the presence of profiling and police misconduct."" King was 25 and on parole after a robbery conviction in March 1991. In an interview in 2011, he recalled he had been drinking and was headed home from a friend's house when he saw a police car following him and panicked, thinking he would be sent back to prison. So he attempted to flee. ""I had a job to go to that Monday, and I knew I was on parole, and I knew I wasn't supposed to be drinking, and I'm like 'Oh, my God,'"" he told CNN. Related: Rodney King looks back without anger . He realized he couldn't outrun the police, but looked for a public place to stop. ""I saw all those apartments over there, so I said, 'I'm gonna stop right there,'"" he said. ""'If it goes down, somebody will see it.'"" An amateur cameraman caught the scene as four white police officers struck King more than 50 times with their wooden batons and used a stun gun on him. King said as the officers beat him, they yelled, ""We are going to kill you, n***er,"" although the officers denied using racial slurs. The video shows King cowering on the ground and attempting to crawl away as he is surrounded by a crowd of police officers. Four of them used their nightsticks to strike him. King was beaten nearly to death. Three surgeons operated on him for five hours. The video of the beating appeared on national television two days later, focusing attention on the issue of racially-motivated police brutality. ""We finally caught the Loch Ness Monster with a camcorder,"" King attorney Milton Grimes said. Four LAPD officers -- Theodore Briseno, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Sgt. Stacey Koon -- were indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer. But following a three-month trial in the predominantly white Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley, three of the officers were acquitted of all charges. The jury, which had no black members, deadlocked on one charge of excessive force against Powell, and a mistrial was declared on that charge. Powell's attorney, Michael Stone, said last year the unedited video worked against King and helped prove the officers' case. ""Most of the nation only saw a few snippets where it's the most violent,"" Stone said. ""They didn't see (King) get up and run at Powell."" But African-Americans in Los Angeles exploded in outrage. Rioters ran through the streets -- looting businesses, torching buildings and attacking those who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The violence was responsible for more than 50 deaths and $1 billion in property damage. On the third day of rioting, King emerged from seclusion to make a plea: ""People, I just want to say, can we all get along? Can we get along?"" The violence ceased, but the debate did not. Nearly a year later, the four officers stood trial in federal court on civil rights charges. Two African-Americans were picked for the jury, and King testified. He hedged, however, on whether police used racial slurs during the beating. He told CNN in 2011 that slurs were used, but said he vacillated on the stand because his mother had told him to avoid talking about race. Koon and Powell were found guilty and sentenced to 30 months in prison. Briseno and Wind were acquitted. ""It was like ... I just hope we just get one,"" King said. ""I hope we just get one on that. If we get one, we're good. So to get the two, I was really happy."" King also sued the city of Los Angeles. ""Half of them had no sympathy whatsoever,"" Kelly, his fiancee, told CNN in 2011 about her fellow jurors. ""... They just didn't care. Like, 'He broke the law. He deserved what he got.' I told them they were crazy. It was about justice for what happened to him. No one deserves to get beat like that."" The other jurors came around, and King was awarded $3.8 million in damages. In later years, King had several more run-ins with the law, including a 90-day jail stint in 1996 for a hit-and-run involving his wife at the time. On the 20th anniversary of the beating in 2011, he was pulled over and ticketed for a minor traffic violation. ""The trouble that (people) see me in is a part of my life that I'm working on,"" he said in 2011. ""I'll always have an issue when it comes to alcohol. My dad was an alcoholic. The addiction part is in my blood. What I've learned to do is arrest my addiction -- arrest it myself, so I don't get arrested."" In 2008, King appeared on the VH1 reality show ""Celebrity Rehab."" He also released a memoir, ""The Riot Within,"" in which he describes his difficult upbringing and his reflections on the beating and its aftermath. ""He was a wonderful, sweet man,"" said Bob Forrest, a Los Angeles-based musician and drug counselor who worked with King on ""Celebrity Rehab."" He said King struggled with his sobriety. ""He and I would talk off and on. Sometimes he was doing great, sometimes not. He was always gracious, an honest and gentle soul."" ""He was a wonderful, kind and gentle man,"" said Dr. Drew Pinsky of ""Celebrity Rehab,"" who also appears on CNN sister network HLN. ""He was at the center of a maelstrom and was able to maintain dignity and really keep his head high in a way that was an example for all of us."" The ranks of Los Angeles police are much more diverse than they were at the time of King's beating. Changes have also been made -- some compelled by the courts -- in the way certain neighborhoods are patrolled and how complaints are handled. Sharpton said in his statement Sunday that he had recently spent time with King discussing the release of his book. ""Through all that he had gone through with his beating and personal demons, he was never one to not call for reconciliation and for his people to overcome and forgive,"" Sharpton said. King said last year on the 20th anniversary of his beating that he has forgiven the officers who beat him. ""Yes, I've forgiven them, because I've been forgiven many times,"" he said. ""My country's been good to me ... This country is my house, it's the only home I know, so I have to be able to forgive -- for the future, for the younger generation coming behind me, so ... they can understand it and if a situation like that happened again, they could deal with it a lot easier.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama signed a bill Tuesday reducing the disparity in penalties for the use of crack and powder cocaine, according to the White House. The enactment of the law seals a hard-fought victory for civil rights activists who have argued for years that the differing punishments unfairly target African-Americans. The Fair Sentencing Act repeals a five-year mandatory sentence for first time offenders, and for repeat offenders with less than 28 grams of crack cocaine. The old law set the mandatory sentence for conviction at five grams. African-Americans have been far more likely than whites and Hispanics to be convicted for -- and receive the harsher penalties associated with -- possession of crack cocaine, according to government statistics. White and Hispanic defendants are more frequently charged with possession of powder cocaine. The now-defunct measure had been in place for 25 years. The House passed the new law through a bipartisan voice vote last week, following approval by the Senate in March. Support for reducing the disparity with powder cocaine offenders increased with reports beginning in 2002 by the U.S. Sentencing Commission calling for Congress to change the crack cocaine law. The commission is an independent agency in the judicial branch that develops national sentencing policy for the federal courts. Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, recently contended that the new law will reduce sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. Conyers said crack mandatory sentences had pushed the number of drug offenders in federal prisons from fewer than 5,000 in 1980 to nearly 100,000 in 2009. Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder had both publicly pressed for passage of the new statute. ""This day was long in coming,"" Holder said recently. The attorney general claimed the bill will ""go a long way toward ensuring that our sentencing laws are tough, consistent, and fair."" Members of the Congressional Black Caucus had led the battle for passage for 10 years, but several key Republicans -- including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham -- also pushed for the change. House Republicans Dan Lungren of California, James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, and Ron Paul of Texas also provided high-profile support. Not all Republicans joined the majority, however. The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith, R-Texas, argued vigorously shortly before passage that to reduce the crack cocaine penalties would be a serious mistake. ""Reducing the penalties for crack cocaine could expose our neighborhoods to the same violence and addiction that caused Congress to act in the first place,"" Smith said. ""Crack cocaine is associated with a greater degree of violence than most other drugs. And more than any other drug, the majority of crack defendants have prior criminal convictions.""

"(Business Insider) -- Groupon, the fastest-growing web company on the planet, reportedly turned down a $6 billion buyout offer from Google late last week. Sounds crazy, right? For most two-year-old companies, the idea of getting a $6 billion offer -- never mind turning it down -- is a wild dream. Especially for an idea like Groupon that seems so simple: Daily money-saving coupon offers for local businesses, delivered by e-mail and over the web (A $50 credit to the Gap on sale for $25, for example). So it's understandable that Groupon's decision surprised people. But Groupon was actually smart to turn down Google's offer. Why? Because Groupon is wildly growing in popularity, and is picking up steam so fast that there is no knowing how much it could be worth in a year -- potentially much more than it is now. Here's a snapshot of the company's growth: Groupon says it currently has 40 million subscribers to its daily coupon e-mails, up from 1.5 million a year ago. It is offering deals in more than 300 markets in 35 countries, up from just 28 U.S. markets last year. And Groupon says it has saved its customers more than $800 million so far this year, up from about $50 million last year. For consumers, that means spending less cash -- always a nice thing in tough economic times. And for local businesses, that means bringing new customers in the door, which makes them happy, too. That's why so many restaurants, stores, and service providers are rushing to get their deals on Groupon that the company has had to change its business model to keep up -- no longer just ""one deal per day, per city,"" but several potential deals, customized for the user. As for the company itself, Groupon has more than 3,000 employees -- up from about 125 last year -- including about 1,000 in its wacky Chicago headquarters. (Don't miss our photo tour -- it's truly wild.) And while there are competitors like LivingSocial, which has some 10 million subscribers, attracting a lot of attention and investment, Groupon is still leading the pack. Therefore, the promise of further explosive growth is the biggest reason that Groupon was smart to turn down Google's offer. Imagine Facebook selling to Yahoo for $1 billion in 2006 -- it wouldn't have been worth $50 billion right now. Or imagine that Google had taken Yahoo's meager offer early in its history, too. It wouldn't be worth almost $200 billion as it is today. But there's another big reason why it's smart for Groupon to remain independent, for now: The idea that Google could destroy Groupon under its leadership, due to a massive culture clash. If history is any indication, Google would probably have tried to change Groupon, to make it more Googly. But the two companies have vastly different structures and cultures. And based on our understanding of Groupon, Google could potentially ruin Groupon very easily. Why? Because Groupon is primarily a sales and writing organization, built on people-power and smiles. Of its 3,000 employees around the world, most are in sales, customer support, and editorial. The company employs comedy writers and improv actors, and nurtures corporate gags like an office elaborately decorated as a bedroom for an imaginary, deranged tenant. It's very funny, but also the kind of thing that the brains at Google probably wouldn't find funny, or support. ""I'm not sure this is a tech company that gets built in San Francisco or Palo Alto,"" Groupon co-founder and CEO Andrew Mason told us when we visited his office last month. ""It's so heavily people-dependent -- not really consistent with the way people think about building startups in [Silicon] Valley."" Google, meanwhile, is the prototypical Silicon Valley tech company -- the master algorithm. Yes, there are lots of people at Google, too, including many sales and support staff. But Google's culture is dominated by engineers, the sort of high-GPA geniuses who can answer all of the brain-teaser Google interview questions. And that clash could have been a big problem for Groupon. So for those reasons, Groupon actually looks smart for turning down Google's $6 billion offer. Of course, that's not to say that the companies won't figure out a deal in the future, or that there isn't a chance that Groupon could stumble, and be worth less in the future. But based on the way Groupon is growing in popularity today -- and is expected to generate more than $2 billion in sales next year -- turning down Google's offer isn't as crazy as it sounds.

"(CNN) -- A motorist fired pepper spray Saturday at a group of demonstrators and counter-protesters outside a funeral for a U.S. Marine in Omaha, Nebraska, police said. The incident occurred shortly before 10 a.m. (11 a.m. ET) as members of a small Kansas church that protests at military funerals and counter-protesters stood nearly a block away from First United Methodist Church during services for Staff Sgt. Michael Bock, 26, who died August 13 in Afghanistan's Helmand province. A man in a Ford-150 pickup truck drove by, extended his arm and sprayed with a large can, police said. His vehicle was stopped a few minutes later. ""Initial indications are he was probably targeting the Westboro Baptist Church"" protesters, said officer Michael Pecha, a spokesman for Omaha police. Hear from a CNN iReporter hit with pepper spray at the event . George Vogel, 62, who lives just north of Omaha, was booked for 16 counts of misdemeanor assault and one count of felony assault on a police officer for the pepper-spray exposure, police said. Vogel also faces one count of child neglect because his child was in the truck, Pecha told CNN. Westboro members, led by pastor Fred Phelps, believe God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality"" through events including soldiers' deaths. Members have traveled the country, shouting at grieving family members at funerals and displaying such signs as ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers,"" ""God Blew Up the Troops"" and ""AIDS Cures Fags."" A 2005 protest by church members at the funeral of a Missouri soldier prompted state lawmakers to pass legislation criminalizing picketing ""in front or about"" a funeral location or procession. A federal judge earlier this month rejected Missouri's tight restrictions, saying they violated the free speech clause of the First Amendment. It was unclear Saturday evening exactly who had been pepper sprayed, but a Westboro member said no one in her group was affected. The incident occurred during the funeral and while nearly 600 members of the Patriot Guard Riders ringed the church and stood vigil, the group's state leader said. Scott Knudsen, Patriot Guard Riders captain for Nebraska, said no members of the Patriot Guard had any interaction with the church members or counter-protesters, which he numbered Saturday at about 12. ""We don't get close to them,"" Knudsen said of the Westboro members. ""We have our backs to them."" Patriot Guard members, who come when they are invited by families, shield families from distraction, Knudsen said. ""We don't condone counter-protesters,"" said Knudsen, adding he was troubled by Saturday's incident. ""It's inappropriate,"" he said. ""It's a funeral service."" Pecha also said that there were no altercations between Westboro members and the Patriot Guard. Shirley Phelps-Roper, a member of Westboro Baptist Church, said Omaha police did not adequately control roughly 30 counter-protesters, who she said jostled with church members. She also challenged Knudsen's and Pecha's account, saying a few Patriot Guard members were among the counter-protesters. The group was about 1,000 feet from the church when the driver came by. ""Of course it was directed at us,"" Phelps-Roper, who is Fred Phelps' daughter, said of the pepper spray. None of the 16 Westboro members on the corner were affected because they raised signs to shield themselves or turned away, Phelps-Roper said. The group returned home shortly afterward. Extra officers were on hand for any possible altercations, but there were only verbal exchanges before the truck drove up, police said. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Church member says police didn't control counter-protesters .

"Few people would use the word ""fantastic"" to describe a visit to Fukushima, the site of Japan's 2011 nuclear disaster. But Lady Barbara Judge is not just anybody. Judge, a 66-year-old lawyer and businesswoman with dual British and American citizenship, has been called in by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the company behind the Fukushima, to help relaunch Japan's nuclear power program, which was suspended completely in March 2011. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered its largest recorded earthquake and tsunami, which killed thousands and devastated parts of the country. Seawater flooded the Fukushima nuclear power planted and caused loss of cooling and partial meltdown in three reactor units. The nuclear accident was eventually classified at Level 7, the highest on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, and the authorities evacuated residents within a 20-kilometer radius of the plant. Judge visited Fukushima Saturday to talk to workers in her new role as deputy chairman of TEPCO's Nuclear Reform Monitoring Committee. ""It was fantastic,"" she said. ""It was absolutely hope and enthusiasm, not despair."" Judge met TEPCO employees, some of whom had been on duty on the day of the accident and others who had been working at the plant ever since to clean up the debris and radiation and to make the site fit to reopen. ""I was extremely impressed that these people were so dedicated,"" said Judge. ""They were heroes."" She added: ""I was amazed at how much work had been done to clear up the site and the high aspiration to make the site the safest in the world."" Judge, who was chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Authority for two years from 2004, is relishing the unenviable task of helping TEPCO restore its nuclear energy production. Despite her experience, she knows she was an outsider for her new role at TEPCO. ""Choosing a foreign woman was an important decision (for TEPCO) because women are not often seen at the senior executive level of business in Japan,"" she said. Judge's first tasks in Japan are helping TEPCO change its safety culture and restore public confidence. ""It is a very big challenge because, before the accident, there was a very close relationship between the nuclear regulator and the plant operators,"" said Judge. ""They all knew each other, had been educated together, and therefore there was no competitive regulatory tension."" ""We need to change the culture so that people will be praised and rewarded for pointing out problems. They used to be afraid to say that anything was wrong."" On Judge's first visit to Fukushima Saturday, she was particularly keen to talk to women, who she believes are likely to be the strongest opponents of nuclear power. She said: ""Approximately 20,000 lives were lost as a result of the earthquake and tsunami, but not one of those who died did so as a result of radiation. And radiation experts believe that no-one will die from radiation."" Estimates about the health impact of radiation have varied hugely. One study, by John Hoeve and Mark Jacobson at Stanford University estimated there could be 130 additional cancer deaths, mostly in Japan, as a result of the radiation. Kathryn Higley, head of Nuclear Engineering & Radiation Health Physics at Oregon State University said, in a July 2012 interview with CNN, that although the methods of the Hoeve and Jacobson study were standard, there is still uncertainty around them. Given how much cancer already exists in the world, it would be very difficult to prove that anyone's cancer was caused by the incident at Fukushima Daiichi. World Health Organization estimates that 7.8 million people died worldwide in 2008, so 130 out of that number is quite small, she added. A United Nations scientific body is carrying out a full inquiry, but its interim findings found no serious impact on health."" Working on nuclear power is the latest twist in a career that has taken Judge from law to banking, to countless boardrooms. In the 1980s, she was the youngest ever commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the first female director of a British merchant bank. Her title comes from her second marriage to Sir Paul Judge, former director general of the British Conservative Party, who juggles a similarly vast array of titles in business and public bodies. Judge -- then Barbara Thomas -- started her career as a star law student at New York University with a drive to succeed inherited from her mother. ""Originally, when I told my mother I wanted to be an actress she said that we didn't need any starving actresses in the family, and, if I wanted to act, I should do it in front of a jury and become a lawyer,"" she said. ""My mother was the smartest person I know and she fundamentally believed that women should have a career to offer them the opportunity to be independent."" Judge's graduation coincided with a push to get more women into big, American law firms and with her top grades, she was able to secure several offers. ""I worked extremely hard, often until 3am, but it paid off as I became a partner in my law firm by the time I was 31,"" she said. At the age of 33, Judge became the youngest ever commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ""That was the big break that changed my life,"" she said. Also on Leading Women: The British-born artist who became one of India's leading talents . While at the SEC, Judge had her son, Lloyd Thomas, and took only 12 days off work, returning on day 13 to give a speech to 200 brokers. ""My mother always told me that as long as you have good childcare, you could have a career -- in fact, a good job was harder to find than a good nanny,"" she said. ""I have a wonderful relationship with my son and he is proud of the fact that I worked full time, even when he was young. ""You can have a serious career and also be a serious mother."" In 1983, after three years at the SEC, Judge's first husband relocated to Hong Kong, so she got a job as the first woman director of a British merchant bank, Samuel Montague & Co, to join him in what was then a British territory. ""It was very much a boys' club and it was difficult to be accepted, particularly as an American woman trained as a lawyer, not a banker."" Thirty years on, Judge is still working at the same furious pace and gets up before 5.30am every day to work before breakfast. She plans to take after her mother, who did not retire from her job as a university associate dean until the age of 87. The owner of a resume littered with firsts -- rising to the top of a man's world in the 1970s and 80s -- Judge will inevitably be described as a pioneer for women. ""I feel more like a pioneer now than I did when it was happening,"" she said. ""I never really thought of myself as a 'woman' in the context of my professional life,  I only thought I was a 'person.'"" ""The real pioneer was my mother.""","Tokyo Electric Power Company asks Lady Barbara Judge to help rebuild nuclear power post Fukushima .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Germans, for obvious reasons, prefer their politicians dull. The current German chancellor, Angela Merkel, more than meets local expectations. So on the rare occasion when Merkel says something vivid, something important must be going on. It is. Speaking in Potsdam on Saturday, Chancellor Merkel told a gathering of young Christian Democrats that multiculturalism has failed. That might seem to be saying the obvious. Item: December 20, 2007. Two young men are smoking on a Munich subway train, where smoking is prohibited. A fellow passenger, a 76-year-old pensioner, asks them to stop. What happened next was captured on surveillance cameras. The young men call the old man a ""s--- German"" and savagely beat and kick him, fracturing his skull. Other passengers on the train failed to intervene. One of the attackers was a Greek immigrant, 17. The other, 20, was born in Germany of Turkish parents. The Munich train story captured the attention of the country, symbolizing an apparent deterioration of public order driven by multicultural immigration. After the attack, Hesse governor Roland Koch asked:: ""How much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths, who frequently have a foreign background?"" There are more than 15 million people living in Germany who were either born outside Germany or whose parents were born outside Germany. That amounts to almost 20 percent of the population. This immigrant population is disproportionately connected to almost all of the social problems of modern Germany. Yet the problem that has transfixed the country is, very understandably, the problem of crime. In Berlin, young men of immigrant stock are three times as likely to commit a crime as young men of German background, reports Germany's state broadcaster, Deutsche Welle. In a September interview, Chancellor Merkel endorsed claims that religious young men of Muslim origin were more likely to commit acts of violence than other young Germans. These crimes seem increasingly the work of criminal gangs of immigrant origin that organize resistance to police authority in what the German media -- with tabloid exaggeration -- increasingly call ""No Go areas.""  Violent assaults upon police officers jumped 60 percent between 2005 and 2009, according to the German newspaper Bild. Less spectacular -- but as important to ordinary people's feelings of security -- is the perceived deterioration of public order: declining schools, rising welfare rolls and foiled terrorist attacks. Because of very low birth rates among old-stock Germans, the proportion of foreign-born is highest among those younger than 20s. In the poor Berlin neighborhood of Wedding, three out of four students and at least half the parents lived on unemployment benefits and welfare, even before the global economic crisis. In 2005, The New York Times interviewed a teacher in a Wedding high school: . ""In Wedding, [Evelyn] Rühle says, immigrant children today speak poorer German and have less contact with German culture than when she started teaching 20 years ago. Many Muslim students ... go to Koran classes outside of school and speak only Turkish or Arabic at home. Meanwhile, the growth of digital television has made a host of Turkish- and Arabic-language channels available, intensifying language problems and nurturing identities that are informed more by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the war in Iraq than by the local German environment."" A high-tech economy offers few opportunities for the poorly educated, with the result that immigrants and their children increasingly find themselves dependent on public assistance. In the United States, immigrants are less likely than the native-born to collect welfare or other social benefits. In Europe, immigrants are radically more likely than the native-born to collect welfare and social benefits, with Third World immigrants collecting the most of all. That's the findings of a 2005 study by researchers at Prague's Charles University. European voters have absorbed these uncomfortable data into a suspicious view of newcomer intentions: According to a recent study by the Friedrich Ebert think tank, 34.3 percent of Germans believe that migrants come to Germany primarily to receive welfare benefits. Merkel's Potsdam speech did not cite those social problems. In Germany, the problems created by immigration literally go without saying, and those who do try to talk about them rapidly find themselves ejected from public life. Thilo Sarrazin, a governor of the Bundesbank (and it's worth mentioning, a member of the left-of-center Social Democratic party) was pressured to resign his post in September after publishing a book arguing the failure of Germany's absorption of immigrants. Yet in the words of Sigmund Freud, the repressed always return. Even if Germany and the other European Union countries can prevent the immigration population from growing -- and that is a very uncertain if -- they must find ways to deal with integrating the immigrant population already present, both first- and second- generation. It's safe to say that no country in Europe is succeeding at that all-important job. Two weeks ago, I visited the British city of Birmingham. In 2005, the city had been torn by riots that erupted about 50 yards from the lawyer's office in which I met with four community activists. The riots were sparked when a rumor spread through the neighborhood's Afro-Caribbean population that some Asian youths had gang-raped a black girl. That rumor proved false, but only after blacks and Asians had fought two days of street battles that left two people dead. I asked these local leaders how things had changed since 2005. The answer: not very much at all. The authorities had responded to the riots by infusing more money into the community and by intensifying police patrols. But the mutual suspicions between groups had not been allayed. Problems of integration remained. One of the four activists I met was obviously uncomfortable speaking English, even though born and raised in the United Kingdom. One said to me very poignantly: ""The British don't know who they are, so they can't teach us how to adapt."" On the other hand, it's not so clear how much the newcomers want to adapt. The man who spoke poor English had spent his entire life inside an Islamic school system, memorizing the Quran in Arabic. Hard to see how that form of knowledge would equip anyone for life in a modern technological society. Chancellor Merkel's Potsdam speech raised the question: Could more be done to accelerate immigrant adaptation? Unfortunately the speech offered few answers. Quietly, some Europeans are wondering whether Europe -- by stumbling into an American-style immigration policy -- has willy-nilly forced itself to follow other American policies as well: . -- Tougher law enforcement and longer prison sentences to fight crime. -- A less generous welfare state that compels migrants to work rather than collect benefits paid for by the native-born. -- A stronger assertion of national identity -- and a more emphatic demand that newcomers adapt to the existing society. These days, many American conservatives are warning that the United States is going the way of Europe. But maybe the real story is the reverse: Is it Europe that will soon be imitating the United States? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","German chancellor Angela Merkel said multiculturalism hasn't worked .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House ethics committee on Thursday accused veteran Rep. Charles Rangel of 13 violations of House rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of Congress. The charges accused the 20-term Democrat from New York of using his influence to solicit donations for a college policy center in his name from corporate heads and others with business before the powerful House Ways and Means Committee that Rangel chaired until forced to give up the leadership position earlier this year. Other charges involve alleged income tax and financial disclosure violations, as well as improper use of government mail service and letterhead. ""Credibility is what's at stake here; the very credibility of the House itself before the American people,"" said Rep. Mike McCaul, the ranking Republican on a subcommittee that will hold a trial-like hearing on the charges against Rangel. McCaul spoke at the subcommittee's first meeting, described as an organizational session. Rangel was not required to attend and did not show up to hear the first public disclosure of the formal charges against him. Asked later about his response to the charges, Rangel sounded contrite in saying he may have been ""overzealous"" in serving the public but took some comfort that the allegations involved no ""corruption"" or ""self-dealing."" ""I can't make an excuse for serious violations, but I can have an explanation of my intent,"" he said. ""And to large degree that's what my life has been all about--intent."" Rangel said it was ""a very, very rough period for me and my family, but we all, including my community, will get by this."" In the days leading up to the hearing, Rangel had said he welcomed the completion of a two-year investigation by the ethics committee so that he could finally respond to specific accusations against him. According to documents released by the committee, Rangel first learned of the charges being pursued by an investigating subcommittee on June 17. He filed a motion to have the charges dismissed, which the investigating panel denied, the documents showed. In a document dated Wednesday, Rangel's lawyers challenged the scope of the charges against him, saying Rangel ""did not abuse his official position or enrich himself financially."" ""He did not target for solicitation foundations, corporations or individuals with business before the Ways & Means Committee, nor did he offer or provide preferential treatment or favors to potential contributors,"" the document said. ""He received no prohibited benefit, direct or indirect, from his work on behalf of this program that violates the ethics rules."" However, the document said Rangel ""recognizes that the public would have been better served if he had consulted the Standards Committee staff in advance"" of soliciting funding for the college center. Rangel said this week that his lawyers were in talks with committee lawyers on a possible deal to settle the case without a hearing. When Thursday's hearing was delayed for 55 minutes with no explanation, rumors of an imminent agreement quickly spread. iReport: Sound off on this story . However, the panel gathered and held the hearing, and it remained unclear whether a settlement avoiding the spectacle of a trial hearing was possible. According to the charges, Rangel allegedly failed to report more than $600,000 on financial disclosure reports and improperly used a rent-subsidized apartment as a campaign office for over a decade and failed to pay taxes on a home in the Dominican Republic. Rangel ""argues that errors on his personal taxes do not implicate discharge of his official responsibilities,"" committee investigators concluded in response to Rangel's request to have the charges dismissed. He ""appears to be operating under the erroneous belief that the only conduct subject to discipline is conduct directly related to the discharge of his official responsibilities."" An investigative subcommittee report on Rangel's dealings, available on the committee's website, detailed a lengthy series of meetings the congressman held with business leaders to raise funds for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Policy at the City College of New York. His repeated attempts to woo potential donors violated the House's solicitation and gift ban, the report said. Among other things, the report stated that Rangel met with a lobbyist for insurance giant AIG in April 2008 with the objective to ""close"" a $10 million ""gift for the Rangel Center."" At the meeting, ""AIG raised concerns about a potential donation, including the potential headline risk,"" the report stated. But Rangel pushed ahead, asking ""AIG, at least twice, what was necessary to get this done."" During the period of time that Rangel was seeking donations from AIG, according to committee investigators, the company was lobbying the House on several tax and trade issues -- matters over which Rangel exercised considerable influence. It also noted that, in March 2007, he used congressional letterhead to send notes to business leaders such as Donald Trump, in which he requested meetings to discuss the Rangel Center. The congressman's ""acceptance of favors and benefits from donors to the Rangel Center ... might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties,"" the report concluded, adding that the ""accumulation of (Rangel's) actions reflected poorly on the institution of the House and, thereby, brought discredit to the House."" In the July 28 response, Rangel's lawyers argued that some of the cited infractions were unintended in his effort to help the college. ""If he mistakenly used the wrong letterhead or other modest resources in this worthy cause, the error was made in good faith,"" the document said. ""It is undisputed that every single charitable contribution in this case went to CCNY, a public educational institution, and not to the congressman,"" it said, later adding that""the uncontroverted evidence is that Congressman Rangel never suggested that any donor to the Rangel Center would receive favorable consideration in legislative matters and never gave preferential treatment to any contributor."" McCaul said the allegations against Rangel, if proven, would violate ""the most fundamental code of conduct"" for House members. Rep. Gene Green of Texas, a Democrat who led a two-year ethics subcommittee investigation of Rangel, said it was a difficult job. ""The task is even more difficult when the subject has befriended and mentored so many new members, and I'm one of them,"" Green said. Another ethics committee member, Republican Rep. Jo Bonner of Alabama, said ""this is truly a sad day where no one, regardless of their partisan stripes, should rejoice."" Rangel temporarily stepped down as Ways and Means Committee chairman earlier this year following the announcement of an ethics investigation of several allegations, including failure to pay taxes on the Dominican Republic residence. The House ethics committee previously admonished Rangel for violating rules on receiving gifts. Specifically, the committee found that Rangel violated House gift rules by accepting reimbursement payments for travel to conferences in the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008. Rangel, whose autobiography that discusses his Korean War experience is titled ""And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since,"" told reporters earlier Thursday that ""I have to reassess that (statement)"" in light of the pending hearing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday -- in response to a question about Rangel -- that there must be ""accountability"" and ""transparency"" in cases of ethical transgressions. ""Holding a high ethical standard is a serious responsibility ... and a top priority"" for the House Democratic leadership, she said. In terms of political fallout from cases such as Rangel's, ""the chips will fall where they may,"" she said. Congressional Democrats have reportedly expressed concern that an extended public airing of the charges against Rangel could damage the party's prospects in the November midterm elections. CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Brianna Keilar, Evan Glass, Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Rangel offers his first response to the charges made public Thursday .

"(Mashable) -- The premiere plastic guitar game just flamed out. Activision, beset by falling sales, has decided to shutter the division that created ""Guitar Hero"" and its sequels. It's an ignominious exit for a title that was once touted as the first great game franchise of the 21st century. ""Guitar Hero"" was created in 2005 by indie studio RedOctane, in collaboration with Harmonix, which had previously found success with the ""Karaoke Revolution"" franchise. ""Karaoke Revolution,"" where players plugged microphones into their consoles and were scored on the accuracy of their singing, was the first game to show a significant number of videogamers were interested in making ""music."" RedOctane's ""Guitar Hero"" proved they were equally interested in shredding a plastic guitar. Activision purchased the franchise in 2006 for $100 million; to date it has shipped more than 25 million units for a roughly $2 billion ROI. ""Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock"" made $1 billion on its own. Harmonix went on to publish the highly successful ""Rock Band"" franchise, which added drums, microphones and keyboards to the plastic guitar mix. How the mighty have fallen. The holiday season was a disastrous one for the music game genre. First Harmonix was sold by Viacom to a consortium of shareholders; the terms were undisclosed, but it was reported to be a fire sale. MTV Games, which collaborated with Harmonix on ""Rock Band,"" was shut down. ""Guitar Heroes: Warriors of Rock,"" the sixth title in the series, received lackluster reviews and even more lackluster sales. Activision posted a $233 million net loss for the fourth quarter. Its decision to lay off the 500-person ""Guitar Hero"" division was, Activision said in a press release today, ""due to continued declines in the music genre."" So what stopped the music? The first culprit: oversaturation. There are just too many games competing in the genre (""Band Hero"" and ""DJ Hero,"" anyone?), with too many pricey controllers. A ""Warriors of Rock"" guitar bundle will set you back $80. Considering many of the controllers do not play nice with similar games, that's a lot of dough to drop on pretend jamming. Secondly, there's the novelty factor. The dynamics of the game changed little from one title to the next, despite the introduction of innovations such as a touch-sensitive slide bar on later guitar controllers. At a certain stage, users are going to be more interested in picking up a real guitar. The series also felt like it was running out of great rock anthems for users to emulate. Reviews of ""Warriors of Rock"" complained that the set list seemed dull and full of synth-heavy tunes. Finally, of course, Activision isn't going to stop actually selling ""Guitar Hero"" titles any time soon. If you're interested in becoming a maestro of the pretend Gibson, you can still pick up the ""Guitar Hero"" back catalog and buy extra songs online. ""Guitar Hero"" and ""Rock Band"" may one day be seen as a classic party game, pulled out of the closet at holidays and special gatherings, the way we play Monopoly or Scrabble today.

"(CNN) -- Singer Natalie Cole told CNN's Larry King she is searching for a kidney after an illness caused both of her kidneys to fail. Singer Natalie Cole continues to tour, despite being on dialysis three times a week. Before she finished telling King Tuesday night about her battles with drugs, illnesses and her search for a kidney, dozens of e-mails flooded the CNN studio. They were all offers from people saying they would get tested to see whether their kidney could be donated. King handed a thick stack of paper to Cole.

""I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,"" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole. Cole said her kidney troubles date back to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the hepatitis C from her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin. Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic. Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed. ""I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body."" Since then, Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue. Cole won six Grammy awards for her 1991 critically acclaimed album ""Unforgettable ... With Love ,"" a jazzy tribute to her father.

"Texas on Wednesday became the latest state to have a federal judge strike down its same-sex marriage ban, thanks to a sweeping decision holding that its current prohibition has no ""legitimate governmental purpose."" The ruling, by San Antonio-based Judge Orlando Garcia, will not take effect immediately: Its enforcement has been stayed while the case works its way through the appeal process, meaning same-sex couples in Texas cannot get married for the time being. Still, gay rights supporters and activists believe the judgment -- because of what it says, how it follows similar rulings in other states and where it happened, in one of the most conservative states in the country -- has special significance. Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa called Wednesday ""a historic day for the LGBT community and the state of Texas,"" while the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's head predicted the ruling ""hastens the day when all loving couples who simply want the ability to share the benefits and responsibilities of marriage can."" Victor Holmes, one of the four plaintiffs that brought the lawsuit, pumped his fist in the air and cried ""woo hoo!"" in reaction to what he called ""an awesome first step."" ""Growing up, (with) my mom and dad, I envied their marriage because I really didn't think that I would be able to have something like that,"" Holmes, a 23-year U.S. Air Force veteran, said alongside his partner Mark Phariss. ""And now ... reading that decision, it really was the first time I realized that, yeah, I can."" Those on the other side of the debate, meanwhile, are promising to keep fighting. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said his office will challenge the ruling, which would be heard by a federal appeals court in New Orleans. The Republican is running for governor, with early primary voting now in full swing and the full primary election set for March 4. ""The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled over and over again that states have the authority to define and regulate marriage,"" said Abbott. ""The Texas Constitution defines marriage as between one man and one woman."" Gov. Rick Perry, who is not running for re-election, offered even more forceful remarks, insisting that the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ""guarantees Texas voters the freedom"" to decide on the parameters for marriage. ""Texans spoke loud and clear by overwhelmingly voting to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman ..., and it is not the role of the federal government to overturn the will of our citizens,"" said Perry, an outspoken conservative who ran for president in 2012. ""... This is yet another attempt to achieve via the courts what couldn't be achieved at the ballot box."" In November 2005, Texas became the 19th state to adopt a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Whether homosexual couples should be allowed to wed like heterosexual ones was a hot-button issue then and in subsequent years, with polls showing that most Americans favored restrictions. But public opinion shifted over time. A CNN/ORC International survey last June found a majority -- 55% -- of Americans back same-sex marriage, up 11 percentage points from 2008. A total of 17 states now allow such legal unions, due to actions by voters, state courts or their legislatures. Federal courts have also helped move the needle on the issue, especially over the past year. The most significant such move came last June, when the Supreme Court rejected parts of the Defense of Marriage Act while ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. The justices didn't go as far as saying that all states must allow such marriages to take place within their borders, but a number of lower federal courts have since stepped in to the fray. Federal judges have ruled that gay marriage bans in Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Utah violate the U.S. Constitution. Judge Garcia echoed his colleagues Wednesday with respect to Texas, saying that ""equal treatment of all individuals under the law is not merely an aspiration it is a constitutional mandate."" ""(The Texas law) is unconstitutional because, without a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose, it denies same-sex couples the benefits, dignity and value of celebrating marriage and having their out-of-state marriage recognized,"" the judge said. In his ruling, Garcia raised notable arguments from some supporters of same-sex marriage bans: that allowing such unions would hurt children raised in them, that it would stifle procreation and that it ""could lead to the recognition of bigamy, incest, pedophilia and group marriage."" The judge then shot down the defense's case. ""Procreation is not and has never been a qualification for marriage"" and ""tradition, alone, cannot form a rational basis for a law."" Texas has ""the 'unquestioned authority' to regulate and define marriage,"" but only ""in a way that does not infringe on an individual's constitutional rights,"" Garcia added. ""It is clear that (the four plaintiffs) suffer humiliation and discriminatory treatment under the law on the basis of their sexual orientation, and this stigmatic harm flows directly from Texas' ban on same-sex marriage,"" the judge wrote. ""(Texas' law also) causes needless stigmatization and humiliation for children being raised by the loving same-sex couples being targeted."" After the ruling, all the key players acknowledged the fight isn't over. Ultimately, it may fall to the Supreme Court to decide whether the gay marriage bans in Texas and a host of other states are legal under the U.S. Constitution. For now, though, the Texas plaintiffs are celebrating. Phariss says the courts' decision ""are going to put an end"" to stories like his as a  youngster, going to bed ""knowing they're gay and praying that they won't wake up."" That sentiment was echoed by Nicole Dimetman, who is raising a child with her partner and fellow plaintiff Cleopatra De Leon. ""It's a huge victory for us, but it is also a victory for young people that don't have to go through the process that we all went through growing up -- of daring to dream,"" Dimetman told reporters. ""They will have the same dreams from the time that they're little that their parents had. And I think that that's amazing."" Map: Same-sex marriage in the United States .

"The Supreme Court was the scene of an unusual disturbance during its public session on Wednesday, when a man interrupted an oral argument. The incident occurred near the end of debate between the nine justices on the bench and counsel, in a case over attorney fees in patent disputes. A man in a suit and dark tie rose from near the back of the marbled courtroom, and began loudly talking. Witnesses said he spoke about the need to keep campaign finance reform laws in place to regulate election spending and contributions. ""Money is not speech,"" he reportedly said. ""Overturn 'Citizens United!'"" referring to a 2010 high court decision loosening a century of federal restrictions on corporate spending by ""independent"" groups like businesses and unions. He was only able say a few words before police escorted him from the courtroom, and did not resist. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg identified the man as Noah Newkirk of Los Angeles. Newkirk has been charged with violating federal law that makes it a crime to ""harangue"" or utter ""loud threatening or abusive language in the Supreme Court Building."" The justices ignored the incident. The court's official written transcript of the argument made no mention of the remarks. Such outbursts are rare. Court officials say the last time it happened was eight years ago, during an oral argument over a federal law restricting a certain type of later-term abortion procedure. A similar interruption occurred about two decades ago. The courtroom has about 330 seats available to the public. Court security instructs spectators before each public session to remain seated, not to speak, or demonstrate. Signs also are not allowed, nor are any electronics or cameras.

"Mickey Rooney's widow has filed a challenge against the validity of the will the legendary actor signed just weeks before his death at 93, her lawyer said. The will left Rooney's estate to a stepson and nothing to his wife, Janice, or other children. Attorney Eugene Belous told CNN he would be in Los Angeles County Probate Court on Monday morning to argue that the will contains ""a blatant misstatement"" about agreements between her, the actor and his conservator. How Mickey Rooney showed America its heart . ""There is NO provision in either of the two settlement agreements ... that terminates or in any way effects (her) rights as surviving spouse,"" Belous said. A court filing says Jan Rooney signed an agreement waiving all claims to her husband's estate after the couple separated in June 2012 after 34 years of marriage. Mickey Rooney's court-appointed conservator, who is also named as executor in the will, told CNN on Friday that the challenge of the will ""is totally without merit."" Since there is not much money to fight over, attorney Michael Augustine said Rooney's widow, who was separated from her husband the last two years of his life, was seeking public attention with the challenge.  ""She cannot resist her additional five minutes of fame,"" Augustine said. Although Rooney disinherited his children, his wife and all but one of her children in a will he signed just weeks before his death, court papers suggest there is not much in his estate to fight over. His personal property is valued at just $18,000 despite an unmatched 90-year film career. The will signed by Rooney on March 11, 2014, left the entire estate to stepson Mark Rooney, one of Jan Rooney's sons, who was the actor's caretaker the last two years of his life. He died on April 7. Rooney ""intentionally omitted"" and disinherited his eight surviving biological children and two other stepchildren from his last marriage, the will said. Rooney had no negative feelings toward his surviving children, but they were all financially better off than he was, Augustine said, adding that Rooney believed that what little he had to leave should go to Mark Rooney and his wife, because they had been taking good care of him in his final two years. A hearing is scheduled for Monday to start the process of probating the actor's will. An attorney for Mickey Rooney's children is also contesting the will, Belous said. Fight over Mickey Rooney's remains averted . Augustine said there was no question that Rooney was of sound mind when he signed the will last March. The actor had just finished filming his ""Night at the Museum"" scenes with Dick Van Dyke, in which he had no trouble learning his lines, he said. An independent lawyer appointed by a judge confirmed that he found Rooney to be ""perfectly competent,"" Augustine said.","Jan Rooney's will challenge is ""totally without merit,"" actor's lawyer says .

"History does not necessarily repeat itself, but sometimes it makes echoes. An echo from 50 years ago reverberates today over the flap regarding the Redskins nickname and logo. Disturbed by the Redskins quarter-century ban against African-American players, the Kennedy administration in 1961, with Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall spearheading the effort, instructed team owner George Preston Marshall to lift the racial ban or face federal sanction. Marshall had signed a 50-year contract to play home games in the newly constructed D.C. Stadium scheduled to open in 1962. The federal government controlled the land on which the stadium sat, and as landlord it would deny use to any employer who practiced racial discrimination. Marshall was initially defiant. He would never yield to the government's demand. The Redskins had a long history and tradition of ""no black players"" that resonated with its fervent fan base. If he signed black players, white fans might retaliate by not buying tickets and merchandise. Didn't the Kennedy administration have more important issues to deal with than whether the Redskins had a black player? And why blacks in particular? Why not other ethnic groups? Why not a female player? The move to integrate the Redskins was liberalism run amok, said traditionalists. Troublemaking socialists were trying to tell a business owner how to run his business. But the federal threat of withholding use of D.C. Stadium and mounting public pressure from sports journalists, opinion shapers, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and the black community, including Jackie Robinson, eventually caused Marshall to jettison the team's sacred lily white tradition and hire black players. At the time, few Americans, including Udall himself, considered the Redskins nickname racially insensitive. In fact, Udall played high school football and basketball for the St. Johns, Arizona -- you guessed it -- Redskins. In the 1930s when Udall went to high school and in the early 1960s when he headed the interior department, racial stereotypes were commonplace. African-Americans were referred to as ""darkies"" and ""colored,"" and Native Americans as ""redskins."" On TV Westerns, ""Indians"" were sometimes portrayed as noble characters, but ""redskins"" almost never were. Over the decades, most Americans have come to learn that names like ""darkies,"" ""colored"" and ""redskins,"" not to mention the N-word, are considered racially offensive and hurtful. The Washington Redskins made a partial concession to racial sensitivity in the early 1960s when they cleaned up the demeaning language in their fight song, which read, in part, ""Scalp 'um, swamp 'um, we will take 'um big score."" Unlike George Marshall, Dan Snyder, the present-day owner of the Washington football team, is no racist. Nor are the vast majority of the team's fans. But he, and perhaps most fans of the team, refuses to acknowledge that the nickname and logo are offensive. Like Marshall, he is being pressured by the President of the United States and the commissioner of the NFL to consider a name change. Like Marshall, he is defiant. He will ""NEVER"" give up the name. Fans of the team defend the name and logo on the basis of history and tradition. But a half century earlier, diehard fans were using history and tradition to defend a system of racial segregation in the South. American Nazis paraded outside D.C. Stadium carrying signs reading ""Keep Redskins White."" Just like then, current defenders of tradition blast liberals for interfering in an issue that is none of their business. Traditionalists claim the nickname honors Native Americans. But the name is no more ennobling than slurs for Jews, Irish, Japanese or other Asians. Some fans ask why focus on the Redskins in particular? Because names like Chiefs, Indians (minus Chief Wahoo) and Braves (minus the tomahawk chop) are not demeaning. ""What about the Irish of Notre Dame?"" one of my college students asked. ""That's not offensive or demeaning,"" I replied, ""but what if they were named 'the Drunken Irish'?"" ""That would be even better,"" he said. That answer got a laugh but no one really took him seriously. Just as in George Marshall's day, public opinion is mounting for racial sensitivity. A president has become involved. Native Americans have filed a lawsuit against the trademark. Representatives of the Oneida nation have met with officials of the NFL to protest the nickname and logo. On Wednesday Oneida Indians thanked President Obama for supporting a name change. Journalists like Christine Brennan of USA Today, Bob Costas of NBC Sports, Peter King of Sports Illustrated, and Maureen Dowd of The New York Times and others have advocated for a nickname change. The echo is loud and clear. Eventually the Washington team owner will hear it.","Kennedy administration in 1961 asked Redskins team owner to lift its racial ban .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Peru said Tuesday they have begun disciplinary action against jailers who photographed suspected killer Joran van der Sloot posing with two other men held in connection with high-profile killings there. The photograph, first aired by the Peruvian television network America TV, shows the 22-year-old van der Sloot standing alongside fellow inmates Hugo Trujillo Ospina and William Trickett Smith II. A fourth man in the picture is not identified. Peru's National Institute of Corrections said Tuesday that disciplinary action was in the works over the photo. ""On August 23, the Office of Internal Affairs of the institution began administrative and disciplinary actions with the goal of establishing responsibility over the acts of official misconduct by employees of the Castro Castro Correctional Institution,"" the agency announced. ""They improperly used photographic equipment that was meant for administrative duties."" Van der Sloot faces a murder charge in the death of college student Stephany Flores, who was found dead in his Lima hotel room in May. Police said he confessed to the killing after his arrest, but van der Sloot is asking a court to throw out his statement. Authorities say van der Sloot has not received any visits from his family or given any interviews since his arrest. The 22-year-old Dutch national was a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway on Aruba. He was arrested twice but released both times for lack of evidence. He has denied involvement and has not been charged in the case, though federal prosecutors in the United States say he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother in exchange for information about the whereabouts of her daughter's remains. Ospina, a Colombian, faces trial for murder in the contract killing of Peruvian entrepreneur Myriam Fefer, while Smith is accused of killing his Peruvian wife, dismembering her and stuffing her body in a suitcase that was later found by fishermen offshore. Ospina, Smith and van der Sloot were being held in a protective custody wing of the Castro Castro prison, away from other inmates, when the photo was taken last week, Peruvian authorities said. Van der Sloot is the only one of the three who is now being held there, they said.

"(CNN) -- A jawbone found on an Aruban beach will undergo forensic testing to determine whether it is human and, if so, whether it belongs to Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, last seen on the island in 2005, authorities said Tuesday. Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said a part of the bone was sent to the Netherlands Forensic Institute in The Hague, Netherlands. It will be analyzed to determine whether it belongs to an animal or human, he said. If it is human, authorities will attempt to find out whether it belongs to Holloway. ""They are testing for a DNA match,"" said Blanken. Investigators could know as early as Wednesday whether the bone belongs to an animal or a human, he added. Inge Oevering, a spokeswoman for the forensic institute, said the length of testing will depend on the condition of the material, but it normally takes about a week. The institute's findings will be sent back to the prosecutor's office, which will decide whether to make the results public, she said. Oevering declined to provide a description of the material. Blanken said a part of a jawbone with a tooth was found on Friday by an American tourist near the Phoenix Hotel, a large resort on the western side of Aruba. He took it to the police, Blanken said. Contacted by CNN, the hotel referred questions to local authorities. The Dutch paper De Telegraaf similarly reported Tuesday the jawbone was found near the Phoenix Hotel, a location that has been mentioned by Joran Van der Sloot, who was arrested twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance but has not been charged. He has maintained his innocence in her death. The newspaper said a tourist couple found the bone on the beach and turned it in to the hotel clerk, who alerted authorities, offering a slightly different version of events than Blanken. The prosecutor said the bone was initially examined by a forensic expert in Aruba, who determined the bone was from a young woman. But Blanken cautioned the final determination would be made by the forensic institute in the Netherlands. ""I'm happy that it's human. And the initial finding is that it's from a young woman, so maybe we will be able to solve this case. I hope so. But we will wait to see what the findings are,"" he said. Holloway was 18 when she was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot, 23, is jailed in Lima, Peru, awaiting trial on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores. Her body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot. The two were seen entering the room on a surveillance camera. Van der Sloot is also charged with a count of wire fraud and a count of extortion in Alabama for allegedly attempting to extort more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Laura Perez Maestro, Brian Walker and CNN Radio's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","NEW: An initial test indicates the bone belongs to a young woman, prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- The birthday girl every Fourth of July is the Statue of Liberty, the image on party napkins, on parade floats and the backdrop for fireworks displays in New York Harbor. She is the ultimate American symbol, a gift from France to the United States, it is said, implying that she was a gift given government to government. The truth is, she could more correctly be called a gift from one artist to the world. In an era when we have given up the desire to astound each other simply to please or provoke wonder, this an important distinction. Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi dreamed up this colossus back in the late 1800s. A middle-tier statue maker, he took his plan to Egypt and pitched a colossal robed slave holding up a torch to stand at the mouth of the Suez Canal. When that deal failed, Bartholdi brushed off the design and brought it to America, all on his own dime. He went door to door, office to office, presenting the vision and meeting with rejection. But with the well wishes of a few staunch supporters, he kept driving onward, winning other commissions to pay the bills and building Liberty piece by piece in Paris, paying for each section as soon as he could drum up donations. He sought out all of his engineering collaborators on his own. He dreamed up entertainments to raise monies through ticket sales. And it was he who yanked the massive French flag from her face at her unveiling in 1886. He threw himself into the arms of a friend and wept. Liberty remains. Bartholdi is essentially unknown. You say the name Bartholdi, and even savvy New Yorkers look blank. Bartholdi could foresee that future. When he visited Liberty just before leaving America that year, he acknowledged, ""She is going away from me."" He had lost the sense that she was his, a feeling he had possessed when climbing over her copper structure in Paris. She would be given to future generations. Bartholdi created one of the most powerful trademarks in history and is largely unknown. I suppose few people know the name Jim Schindler either, the man who designed McDonald's Golden Arches -- and that was pretty powerful, too. But still it seems a bit amazing Bartholdi should go largely unrecognized for his work of art. We might not feel constantly awestruck that a work 305 feet tall -- taller than the ancient Colossus of Rhodes, whose legend lasted millennia -- mingles with us. But Liberty, barring emergency closures for events such as Superstorm Sandy, attracts about 3.8 million tourists a year. Every year, she flutters the hearts of people hiking to her head, as surely as she fluttered the hearts of immigrants arriving in the New World. Her power remains. She is an echo of an era when people sought to produce wonder and ecstasy in their fellow citizens purely for the sake of creating a fabulous artifact of human possibility, even if their personal fame might vanish before the work did. Astounding and delighting one another was the vogue. Eiffel made his tower, just after he designed the scaffold for Liberty's interior. Thomas Edison proposed a colossal phonograph inside Liberty to make her ""talk."" Inventors brought their products of genius to kaleidoscopic World's Fairs to enchant viewers as much as serve merchant interests. ""When I discover a subject grand enough, I will honor that subject by building the tallest statue in the world,"" Bartholdi said in his 20s, 30 years before he unveiled his statue. It is hard to imagine anyone nowadays either demonstrating the patience to wait for an idea to strike or pursuing the goal of honoring a subject ... a concept. Ideas are now considered important only if they are flypaper for money, not precious, heaven-sent gifts. Good ones are catchy or addictive. Few people try to invent something that will make the consumer say, ""Look what humankind has achieved!"" Our popular entertainments titillate or intoxicate. I worry we have lost our sense of the importance of sharing our talents for the common good, partly because there is so much economic pressure put on the middle class, with stagnating wages and rising costs for housing, food and more . The middle class, in my historical research, seems the group from which big ideas have long sprung. And we compound the pressure by stealing the work of our inventors and artists, leaving them no means to actually survive. We weigh down our potential visionaries and inventors with college debt. When they begin to produce, say, music, we take it from them and pay fractions of pennies to listen to it, even as we pay stockbrokers at the lowest end $7 to $10 to make a trade. We underpay or don't pay for a journalist's writing. We require so little public art or decorative art that those artists of ours who don't rise into the filament-thin clique of superstars only survive by working at many other jobs. Anyone not connected to a company is required to double pay Social Security taxes as well as burdensome health insurance premiums (even with Obamacare). So there is no time for tinkering or deep pondering unless you work for Google or Tesla or SpaceX. Putting our geniuses under the corporate umbrella means we craft amazing inventions, but before we can gloat that mankind has achieved something great for mankind, we monetize the hell out of the invention, putting it out of reach for most or, in the case of, say, medical inventions actually turning those great discoveries into financial burdens . Now I know that Bartholdi created his work for more than altruistic purposes. His ego fueled him. Showing his own anxiety, he got the Statue of Liberty copyrighted with the hope that he could earn income from the commercial use he knew was coming (he was savvy to what he considered the less appealing part of America). When he could never collect, he groused at his financially tight existence. But because he had received cheerleading in his youth from his mother, who encouraged his pursuit of grander visions, he could at least rest easy that he got to see the work complete and knew it would survive him. Nowadays, if we love our kids, dare we encourage them to create something vast and important that might last centuries? Unless their creation was a money magnet, encouraging such an undertaking would almost be like condemning them to potential extinction. In Bartholdi's day, you could try something big and if it didn't work out, you would have your disappointment, but you could still pay the doctor in barter. You could suffer setbacks and failures and know that you would at least get by. It's interesting to me that in my neighborhood in Brooklyn, the artist Kara Walker has installed a giant sugar Sphinx in an abandoned sugar factory that is soon to be turned into pricey condominiums. I'm sure the real estate agents love it as a lure for those future condo sales. Regardless, the lines stretch down the block every day, every hour, for weeks now and visitors speak to reporters who ask about their intense emotional and intellectual reactions to this massive otherworldly sculpture. People flock to see this colossal Sphinx. They come because it's a happening but they also come, I believe, because they are so starved for the work of a person trying to impress them and to amaze them without a corporate entity intervening to make a bundle on it. They wait on noisy Kent Avenue for a fleeting taste of this rarity, for a sign we might still have space for human invention ... that we can all share in what humanity can achieve.","Elizabeth Mitchell: Statue of Liberty birthday girl of July 4; few recall her creator .

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot, whose claim of unlawful incarceration was denied last week, will immediately appeal and fight all the way to the Peruvian Supreme Court and international courts, if necessary, his attorney told CNN Monday. Van der Sloot, a 22-year-old Dutch citizen, is jailed pending trial on charges of first-degree murder and robbery in the May 30 death in of Peruvian student Stephany Flores, 21. In an attempt to nullify a confession he gave police, van der Sloot claimed his civil rights were violated following his arrest. A judge on Friday ruled that his confession and detention stand. His legal strategy now is to ""paralyze the process,"" his lawyer, Maximo Altez, said. Altez said van der Sloot will use every possible law that is available to him, and that if he exhausts Peruvian courts, they will reach out to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica. He maintains that his client's rights have been violated. The attorney, who has been in touch with both van der Sloot and his family, said that the Dutchman is a little ""depressed,"" as anyone in prison would be. Van der Sloot is also a suspect in the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, though he has not been charged in that crime. A court document obtained by CNN shows Flores had a cranial fracture and other injuries to her face and neck and showed signs of asphyxiation. Forensic tests in the hotel room where her body was found showed blood on the floors, hallway and mattress, the document said. According to transcripts of van der Sloot's confession, he said he elbowed Flores in the face before strangling her and then suffocating her with his shirt. The transcripts were provided to CNN by a police source who has not been named because he was not authorized to release the material. Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail in his computer connected with the Holloway case. After killing Flores, police say, van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested on June 3. He was returned the next day to Peru. Van der Sloot is being held at the Miguel Castro Castro Prison, in a high-security area where only two of 10 cells are occupied and he has no contact with the general prison population. In Session's Jean Casarez from the truTV network contributed to this report.","Joran van der Sloot will appeal ruling on his detention to the highest court, if needed .

"In the aviation mystery which has baffled the world there is one fundamental question which continues to swirl:  Has Inmarsat got its numbers right? It was these very calculations which led the search for MH370 far from the plane's original route across South East Asia and deep into the southern Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Australia. No piece of work is more important in the search for the plane. I was given exclusive access to the satellite experts who did the ground-breaking work. Time and again, I would ask them the toughest question: ""Are you right?"" But before we get there ... How did the data come to light in the first place? Once the plane went missing, the ground station in Perth checked the logs and discovered that while the aircraft's communications systems were switched off, the plane and the satellite still kept saying ""hello"" to each other, every hour. ""Having messages for six hours after the plane is lost is probably the biggest disbelief,"" admits Inmarsat's vice president of satellite operations Mark Dickinson. These messages are the raw data upon which everything rests. Read the data . After the alert had been raised at the company's London headquarters, engineers began urgently interpreting the raw data. Dickinson explains: ""We have some timing information ... that allows you to essentially work out the distance from the satellite ... and in addition to that there were some frequency measurements."" Using the discrepancy of satellite frequency known as the Doppler Effect, the team spent ten days refining their work before they briefed the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who stunned the world by revealing the plane's flight had ended in the South Indian Ocean. Dickinson says that when he realized what had probably happened, his reaction was:  ""Let's check this and let's check it again, because you want to make sure when you come to a conclusion like that you have done the right work... As good engineers we are trained to check and check again."" So why is Dickinson so sure he is right? Because the model they created showing arcs and Doppler readings was rigorously tested, initially on other aircraft on the satellite at the same time, and then against previous flights by the same aircraft. With minor disagreements both the position and the Doppler reading of those aircraft was predicted accurately. Other organizations created their own models, ran the comparisons and came to the same conclusions. It is essential to understand: This is not just Inmarsat's frolic. ""No-one has come up yet with a reason why it shouldn't work with this particular flight when it has worked with others,"" Dickinson told me. ""It's very important that this isn't just an Inmarsat activity."" So why haven't they found the plane where Inmarsat says it should be? Simply put, it's a big ocean, the ocean floor is very deep, with valleys and hills. In the bigger picture, the search has really only just begun. The families have been seeking the release of this raw data for weeks. The satellite company has extracted the crucial lines from the logs and has published it with an explanation and analysis. They have not published the raw computer pages which is likely to raise questions about why not. Inmarsat says nothing important has been left out, but that the raw data would not have been understandable on its own. The goal of publication is transparency, not verification. ""What this provides is some transparency on what actual data came back and forwards between the plane and the ground station... How that data has subsequently been used so it allows people to see what technique. I'm hoping a great deal of transparency in terms of the analysis by Inmarsat,"" says Dickinson. So, will the publication quell the critics? Probably not. They want every last digit and bit of data so they can re-create the work, something that is impossible without detailed knowledge of the plane's modem, the satellite's own movement and the performance capabilities of the 777 aircraft. Having covered this story from the moment the plane was lost, I know only too well that the everything hinges on Inmarsat's data. Could Dickinson be wrong? As an engineer he is, of course open to the possibility, but he insists his data has been ""checked and checked ... to make sure we've got it right. Checked against other flights in the area at the same time; checked against previous flights of this aircraft. At the moment there is no reason to doubt -- I believe what this data says."" And that is the heart of the matter. Inmarsat and others will never say they are convinced, they are not those sorts of people. Certainty is the prerogative of those of us less rigorously trained to consider fallibility. Inmarsat's engineers will just rely on the numbers.

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Police said Thursday that they found skin underneath the fingernails of Stephany Flores, whose body was found June 2 in the hotel room in Lima, Peru, of Joran van der Sloot. Miguel Canlla Ore, a colonel in the Peruvian National Police and head of homicide, told journalist Victoria Macchi that the amount of skin was small and that laboratory DNA tests that might indicate its provenance had not been completed. Peruvian authorities have charged the 22-year-old Dutchman with murder in the death of the 21-year-old woman, whom van der Sloot had met while gambling in Lima. He was also the lead suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance in Aruba but was never charged because of a lack of evidence. A court document obtained by CNN shows Flores had a cranial fracture and other injuries to her face and neck and showed signs of asphyxiation. Forensic tests in the hotel room where her body was found showed blood on the floors, hallway and mattress, the document said. According to transcripts of van der Sloot's confession, he said he elbowed Flores in the face before strangling her and then suffocating her with his shirt. The transcripts were provided to CNN by a police source who has not been named because he was not authorized to pass along the material. Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail in his computer connected with the Holloway case. After killing Flores, police say, van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested on June 3. He was returned the next day to Peru. Van der Sloot is being held in a high-security area of the Miguel Castro Castro Prison, where only two of 10 cells are occupied and he has no contact with the general prison population.

"Six months ago, the finish line of the Boston Marathon was a scene of smoke, blood and death. On Saturday, tragedy became triumph when the victory parade of the World Series champions Boston Red Sox crossed the same line surrounded by crowds, which were expected to reach 1 million people over the entire celebration route. What the Red Sox mean to Boston . In a crowning moment, Red Sox player Jonny Gomes rested the World Series trophy on the finish line, draped with a team jersey whose back declared ""Boston Strong 617,"" the slogan created to overcome April's terror attacks. Led by an announcer, the team and crowd sang ""God Bless America"" at the line, which remains painted on the street. The championship parade marked the restoration of a city's soul, darkened during bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others who gathered last spring to watch the marathon near the finish line. But on Saturday, the pall cast over that line was vanquished. A great American city found its spirit returned. And it rejoiced. See the parade's best moments . ""The last time I was standing on the streets of Boston was the day of the marathon, and I'd just like to say thank you to the Red Sox for bringing all these people back to the streets for something so great to celebrate,"" said parade attendee Laurie Delaney of Dedham, Massachusetts. In fact, on the day of the bombings six months ago, Delaney was on Boylston Street where the explosions occurred, and earlier that day, she was at a Red Sox game. Saturday's celebration was emotional, she said. Every Bostonian attending the parade remembered where they were the day of the bombings. Ryan Sedlacek was in his Boston home less than a mile from the finish line. ""It doesn't fix what we went through, but it helps cover it up,"" Sedlacek said of the collective rejoicing. What made the moment doubly triumphant was how the Boston Red Sox finished in last place in 2012. In a city passionate about its baseball, the team went from worst to first, despite the attacks on the city. The Red Sox won the World Series on Wednesday night, defeating the St. Louis Cardinals. The team won it at home, in Fenway Park, the first time they've done so since 1918. The victory seemed a godsend. ""It feels like it should have happened,"" Sedlacek said. The Red Sox team met with bombing survivors over breakfast, just before the fanfare of vehicles and about two dozen amphibious duck boats began the motorcade at the team's stadium at 10 a.m. Saturday, said Heather Abbott, one of the survivors who attended the gathering. The parade ended in the Charles River when the duck boats took to the water and motored along the shore.","Crowd and team sing ""God Bless America"" at finish line .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot has filed a complaint with Peruvian police claiming that his constitutional rights and his right to a defense were violated after his arrest in connection with the killing of a Peruvian woman. According to a copy of the complaint, obtained by CNN, van der Sloot alleges that his right to due process was denied. The complaint, given to the Peruvian National Police's internal investigation unit, singles out the department's homicide director, Col. Miguel Angel Canlla Ore, and those who work for him. Van der Sloot said he has been detained without a judicial order. ""I have been denied my right to a proper defense, by imposing an attorney that seems to be the girlfriend of a cop on duty who works in this police department,"" the complaint states. He also alleges that police took his laptop and searched his communications and correspondence without a judicial order. ""I have been imposed an unofficial translator whom has confused me, with the intention of pressuring me to incriminate myself in the homicide investigation,"" the complaint states. The document follows a similar complaint that van der Sloot made to a judge earlier this week. Meanwhile, a judge was expected decide on the legality of van der Sloot's incarceration Wednesday, his lawyer said. If the ruling is unfavorable, attorney Maximo Altez said he is prepared to appeal to the highest court. Peruvian authorities have charged van der Sloot with murder in the death of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. He also is the lead suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance in Aruba but was never charged because of lack of evidence. A court document obtained by CNN shows Flores had a cranial fracture and other significant injuries to her face and neck and showed signs of asphyxiation. Forensic luminol tests in the hotel room where her body was found showed blood on the floors, hallway and mattress, the document said. Altez has maintained that the judge in the case should strike down van der Sloot's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated. But Peruvian police have defended the interrogation, saying that van der Sloot's confession was acquired legally. According to transcripts of his confession, van der Sloot said he elbowed Flores in the face before strangling her and then suffocating her with his shirt. The transcripts were provided to CNN by a police source who has not been named because he was not authorized to pass along the material.

"When was the last time you saw a blockbuster film that didn't include a gun? It might be hard to remember. Americans love movies that depict violence, a new study shows; 94% of the most popular movies since 1985 contain at least one violent scene, and half of those involve a gun. For the study, published this week in the scientific journal Pediatrics, researchers analyzed the 30 top-grossing films every year from 1950 to 2012. They identified violent sequences in each movie and noted whether the scenes included a character carrying a gun with the intention of harming or killing a living target. Since 1950, violence in films has more than doubled, the study authors concluded. Perhaps more surprising is that gun violence in PG-13 films has tripled since 1985, even exceeding the amount found in R-rated films in more recent years. ""Parents need to realize that just because a movie has been rated PG-13 does not mean that their 13-year-old should go to see it,"" study author Daniel Romer said. ""We would like to see Hollywood go back to labeling movies with lots of violence, and gun violence in particular, with an R rating, just like they have been doing for explicit sex all along."" The average American sees seven movies in theaters every year, according to Nielsen's 2012 American Moviegoing Report. Those rated PG-13 are often the highest-grossing, bringing in about 45% of the market share. The Motion Picture Association of America first began using the PG-13 rating in 1985. The rating urges parents to be cautious, saying ""some material may be inappropriate for pre-teenagers,"" but theaters do not check IDs for those seeing a PG-13 movie. And some worry that exposing children to violence on the screen may encourage them to act it out in real life. ""There has been a long line of research showing that continued exposure to screen violence among children, mainly on TV, predicts the emergence of later aggressive behavior,"" Romer said. ""We don't know if seeing gun violence on the screen has a unique effect, but it is concerning considering that we have seen a rise in the use of guns in schools and other settings in recent years."" Experts are still debating whether watching violent movies or playing violent games leads to real-life violence. In 2000, a coalition of public health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, published a joint statement, saying science had clearly shown ""a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children."" They said viewing violence led children to view aggressive acts as acceptable behavior and to become emotionally desensitized. The effects were ""measurable and long-lasting,"" according to the statement. Since then, several scientific studies have shown just the opposite. And the American Psychological Association has convened a task force to review the new evidence and potentially update its position. ""The problem is that people are looking for a yes-or-no answer ... when there is none,"" Brad Bushman, professor of psychology at Ohio State University, wrote in an opinion article for CNN. Bushman and his colleagues recently conducted a study that showed college students who played violent video games for 20 minutes at a time for three days showed more aggressive behavior each day they played. ""The argument I hear most often is that video games can't be dangerous because millions of people play these games without becoming violent,"" Bushman wrote. ""That's because they come from good homes, aren't victims of bullying, don't have mental health issues and don't have many of the other risk factors for violence. But what about players who are already predisposed to violence?"" Those who don't believe a link exists have crime data on their side. Coinciding with the rise of violent video games and violence in movies is a significant decrease in juvenile violent crime. In 1993, at the peak, teens aged 12 to 17 had a serious violent crime offending rate of 52 crimes per 1,000 juveniles, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. By 2011, that number had dropped to just six crimes per 1,000 juveniles. While the study authors saw gun violence in PG-13 films triple, the same was not true for R- and G/PG-rated films. Violence in R-rated films held at a steady rate while G-and PG-rated films saw a decrease over the same time period.","Since 1950, violence in films has more than doubled, a new study finds .

"Authorities used pepper spray on a group of protesters trying to enter the National Air and Space Museum on Saturday, forcing the building to close about two hours early. One person was arrested, according to Linda St. Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Institution, which runs that and numerous other museums in Washington. She estimated between 100 and 200 people were in the crowd. Demonstrators railing against U.S. participation in the war in Afghanistan initially gathered Saturday, along with protesters aligned with the national Occupy Wall Street movement, in Washington's Freedom Plaza. The latter effort started in New York more than three weeks ago, targeting the nation's financial sector and various social ills, and has since spread to more than a dozen cities. The Washington demonstrators Saturday chanted ""Occupy Wall Street, Occupy H Street, Occupy Everything, and never give it back."" Some moved from Freedom Plaza toward the museum, which is along the National Mall, escorted by District of Columbia police. Some started to enter the museum to demonstrate against displays of military drones used during the war in Afghanistan. St. Thomas said that one of the protesters pushed a museum security guard against a wall, prompting another guard to respond with pepper spray to force demonstrators outside. ""We wanted to go inside and protest at those particular items of destruction, and the crowd was pepper sprayed going in and was forced out of the building,"" said Brian Morrison, one of the protesters. See video of the protest. Araz Alali, a spokesman with the D.C. Police, said his department had no knowledge the museum security was going to pepper spray the protesters. Demonstrator Greg Slater carried a sign that read ""Occupy Wall Street, not Afghanistan."" He said that the protest did not warrant the type of reaction it got from the museum security guards. ""This is absolutely meant to be a nonviolent protest,"" said Slater. ""It's about peacefully taking back of democracy and ending the war in Afghanistan."" St. Thomas said that the Air and Space Museum will open at its regularly scheduled time of 10 a.m. Sunday.","Anti-war and Occupy Wall Street-aligned protesters march in Washington .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A coalition commander offered his alliance's ""sincere apologies"" Sunday for an airstrike that he said killed nine civilians in southern Afghanistan. Maj. Gen. John Toolan, the head of the International Security Assistance Force's command in southwest Afghanistan, said his apology was being made ""on behalf of the coalition"" and its top leaders, including U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus. He pleaded with Afghans to not only forgive, but also to work with coalition forces in hopes of bolstering their security. ""I offer our heartfelt apologies to the families and friends of those killed,"" Toolan said in a statement. ""I ask that the Afghan people continue to trust and assist their security forces, so that together we can stop the senseless killing brought upon us by an enemy who wants to exploit the Afghan people through fear and violence."" Earlier, Afghan and NATO officials said that Saturday's attack in Helmand province killed a dozen children and two women. There was no immediate explanation for the disparity between this figure and the toll of nine civilians killed offered Sunday by Toolan, who also noted that a U.S. Marine was killed immediately before the strike. The strike provoked the ire of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who strongly condemned the airstrike and insisted he was warning the U.S military and government ""for the last time"" on behalf of the Afghan people about civilian deaths. He called the operation a mistake, but offered a different death toll, saying 10 children, two women and two men were killed. According to Toolan's statement, the strike occurred after coalition troops came under attack in Helmand's Now Zad district, leading to the death of the American Marine. Five insurgents then moved into a compound, where they continued to fire, the ISAF commander said. An airstrike was then ordered on this building ""to neutralize the threat."" Residents claimed that projectiles coming from a coalition helicopter hit two houses where women and children were staying, ISAF spokesman Daud Ahamadi had said earlier. ""Unfortunately, the compound the insurgents purposefully occupied was later discovered to house innocent civilians,"" Toolan said in his statement.. Even as a full investigation into the incident continues, the ISAF commander said, ""We will ensure we make amends to the families (of those killed) in accordance with Afghan culture."" Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold that borders Pakistan, has been the scene of intense fighting this month since insurgents launched their so-called spring offensive. Anger in Afghanistan and Pakistan over civilian casualties has mounted in recent months following NATO airstrikes that have killed dozens along their shared border. In March, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates offered a personal apology to Afghan President Karzai for the killings of nine boys in a helicopter attack targeting insurgents. The top coalition commander in Afghanistan has warned of a likely increase in high-profile attacks by insurgents looking to demonstrate their ability to strike. In a letter this month to ISAF forces, Petraeus said the attacks may increase the risk of civilian casualties and put Afghan and ISAF forces in difficult situations.

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- The last thing we heard before going into Castro Castro prison here was the sound of a metal door closing behind us and the clanking of bolts and locks. We were locked in. Castro Castro is home to some of Peru's most violent criminals, including terrorists. It is also the new home of Joran van der Sloot, who is charged in the murder of a young Peruvian woman, and has long been a suspect the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba. The prison, built in the 1980s to house national terrorists, is surrounded by dirt roads in a poor neighborhood in the outskirts of Lima. It is one of the country's most technologically advanced prisons. Visitors must consent to a full body scan in order to enter the jail. We had to cross several gated perimeters before we arrived at one of the twelve inmate pavilions. Inmates are housed according to their crimes and every inmate group has a leader who serves as a liaison between the inmates and jail officials. We were able to speak freely to inmates in one pavilion used to house inmates accused of drug crimes. They told us that rehabilitation is a big part of their prison life. We were shown several workshops that teach skills including arts and crafts, baking, culinary arts, carpentry, shoe making and computer skills. Prison officials say these inmates have passed psychological exams and have earned the benefit of participating in these specialty workshops. Inmate Walter Ramos told us he would go crazy if it wasn't for the opportunity to be in the art and crafts workshop. He has been in prison for 27 months and has yet to stand trial. The last time he saw a judge was 14 months ago, he says. At Castro Castro. inmates are rewarded for good behavior as a way for authorities to keep the peace amongst the population. As we made our way through the different pavilions and speak to a group of men charged for terrorism we are constantly surrounded by about a dozen guards. They will accompany us for the duration of our 3 hour visit. It is a large amount of security considering that only fifty unarmed guards watch over almost 1600 inmates on a daily basis. Overpopulation is a big problem at Castro Castro. The jail was built to house only 700 inmates, with two inmates per cell but in fact, four to six inmates now occupy most cells, authorities said. We asked to see the living quarters but authorities would not allow it citing security concerns. We were able to see was Joran van der Sloot's cell. Prison officials took us after he was escorted out. We caught a glimpse of him through the fence as guards led him from the protective custody unit. He wore an orange shirt and light colored pants. He is kept in a solitary cell the size of a walk-in closet. It was equipped with a cot covered with a thin mattress and a blanket made from Peruvian textiles. The mattress was probably about six inches thick, and it was covered with a sheet. It seemed comfortable enough to the touch. On top of the bed were several books, most of them in Dutch. The books included a Bible and other religious works. Beneath the books were some magazines. Also on top of the bed were two unopened boxes of what looked like toothpaste. There were hooks on the walls for clothes. Hanging on one was the red knit jacket van der Sloot has worn on television. There was a hole in the floor for a toilet and a concrete sink with running water. The cell didn't seem cold. The floor of the cell was covered with shiny synthetic wood. Van der Sloot does not eat with the other inmates, prison officials said. His meals are prepared separately for him for security reasons. He eats what the prison staff eats. We are told he has met with a criminal defense attorney, Maximo Altez. Outside his cell complex we bump into pastoral superintended Peter Middelkoop, who said he had just met with Van der Sloot to offer him spiritual advice. He could not provide us with any details, citing confidentiality agreements. Jail director Alex Samame told us his goal is to eventually introduce Van der Sloot into the general population. Inmate Ramos said Van der Sloot has nothing to worry about since many at Castro Castro have been accused of similar crimes. ""He is one of us"" he said.","Joran van der Sloot has his own cell at the Castro Castro prison in Lima, Peru .

"Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- The piece of jawbone found on a beach in Aruba this month is human, but is not that of long-missing Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, Aruban prosecutors said Tuesday. The piece contained a wisdom tooth, and Holloway's had been removed before her 2005 disappearance, Aruba Solicitor General Taco Stein told reporters. ""Right there and then, it was obvious it wasn't Natalee,"" Stein said. Investigators are now trying to determine whether the bone came from any other people reported missing, he said. The bone was found by an American tourist near the Phoenix Hotel, a resort on the western side of the island, Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said. Stein said the news was ""another tragedy"" for Holloway's family, since it brought them no closer to learning what happened to their daughter. Holloway was 18 when she was last seen on the island. ""It's very sad for the parents to not have closure,"" Stein said in a later interview. ""They must rest assured we are working hard to solve the case. Whether that will be in the near future, I cannot tell."" Holloway's father, Dave Holloway, thanked well-wishers soon after the announcement. ""We remain hopeful that some day we will find the answer to the whereabouts of our daughter, Natalee Holloway,"" he said. ""Again, we want to thank everyone for their support in our efforts to find justice. We ask that you continue to remember Natalee in your thoughts and prayers."" Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway, did not immediately comment on the case, but her attorney released a statement that said she accepts the outcome. ""Beth accepts the forensic conclusions, is emotionally exhausted from the inexplicably long wait, and deeply disappointed in the time and manner in which she learned of the results,"" said attorney John Q. Kelly. Investigators tested the bone at the Netherlands Forensic Institute in The Hague, Netherlands. Their job was first to determine whether it was a human or animal bone and then -- if it proved to be human -- figure out to whom it belonged. Blanken said the bone was initially examined by a forensic expert in Aruba, who determined it was from a young woman. But Stein said the bone appeared to have been in the water ""for a very long time,"" and it was not possible to determine whether it came from a male or a female. Police collected a second bone Monday that had been found this month on the beach by a New Jersey family, but that one turned out to be an animal rib bone, prosecutors said. Holloway was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama, when she disappeared. She was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad nightclub with Joran van der Sloot and two other men. Van der Sloot was detained twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance but never charged. He is now awaiting trial in Lima, Peru, on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores, whose body was found in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot in May. A surveillance camera captured images of the two entering the room. Van der Sloot, 23, also faces federal wire fraud and extortion charges in the United States, where prosecutors say he demanded more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body. He told Peruvian investigators that he knows where her remains can be found, but would neither identify the location nor say what happened to her on the night of her disappearance, a Peruvian police official told CNN in June. Stein said van der Sloot remains a ""person of interest"" to investigators, and Aruban prosecutors have asked the FBI -- which currently has the hard drive from van der Sloot's computer -- for any information that may be relevant to Holloway's disappearance. But Aruban authorities have no plans to interview him again any time soon, Stein said. ""He has made so many statements before that have proven untrustworthy that we will not just rush to him to see about this statement,"" Stein said.

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot's Peruvian attorney has resigned from defending the murder suspect, the attorney told Peru's Foreign Press Association on Monday. Earlier, Maximo Altez Navarro told CNN that he didn't want to be van der Sloot's attorney anymore. ""This has created many problems for me,"" Altez said. According to Peruvian prison authorities, Altez was the only person to have visited van der Sloot in prison. The 22-year-old Dutch citizen is accused in the death of 21-year-old student Stephany Flores Ramirez last month. On Monday, van der Sloot, who is in the Miguel Castro Castro prison in Lima, was awaiting a psychological evaluation, prison authorities said. He is in a high-security area of the prison where only two of 10 cells are occupied, and he has no contact with inmates in the general prison population. He is under guard 24 hours a day, authorities said. The only other inmate in the area is alleged Colombian hit man Hugo Trujillo Ospina. The two have spent some time together in a common area where there is a television set and weights made of out of broomsticks and soda bottles, authorities said. There is the possibility that van der Sloot will be integrated with other segments of the prison population. According to transcripts of his confession, van der Sloot said he elbowed Flores in the face before strangling her and then suffocating her with his own shirt. The transcripts -- provided to CNN by an anonymous police source -- give shocking details of the murder van der Sloot is accused of and also give the public its first glimpse of why van der Sloot says the alleged murder took place. The source has not been named because he was not authorized to pass along the material. ""There was blood everywhere,"" van der Sloot said in the transcripts. ""What am I going to do now. I had blood on my shirt. There was also blood on the bed, so, I took my shirt and put it on her face, pressing hard, until I killed Stephany."" Peruvian authorities charged van der Sloot with murder last week. Van der Sloot has also been considered the main suspect in the well-publicized 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case. In the transcript, van der Sloot said that after Flores read the e-mail, she punched him in the face. ""At that moment impulsively, with my right elbow I hit her in the face exactly on top of the nose,"" van der Sloot said. ""I think she started to faint. It affected me so that I grabbed her from the neck and strangled her for a minute."" Van der Sloot said he had a quick thought that he might try to hide the body but instead fled. He was arrested in Chile on June 3 and was returned the next day to Peru. Along with killing Flores, who had a broken neck, he took money and bank cards from her wallet, police said. Van der Sloot told police in Chile a different story of how Flores died when he was arrested there, according to transcripts. He blamed the death on robbers who had waited for him at his hotel in Peru. ""There was a man coming from the access door with a knife in his hand,"" van der Sloot said. ""The man with the knife hit her in the face, making her bleed through the nose."" But Peru authorities said they had overwhelming evidence pointing to van der Sloot, and when he was transferred to Peru, van der Sloot confessed to the crime, police said. Van der Sloot said he was in Peru for a poker tournament and had met Flores while he was gambling. Police have said they think van der Sloot killed Flores to steal money she won from gambling. Van der Sloot offered a different motive. ""After I responded with hitting her, I feared that she would go to the police and they would detain me for what was an impulsive act,"" van der Sloot said. ""I think I wanted to kill her because I wasn't thinking."" Before he quit, Altez had planned to ask the judge in the case to strike down van der Sloot's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated. Peruvian police have defended the interrogation and said van der Sloot's confession was acquired legally.","NEW: Joran van der Sloot's attorney resigns .

"(CNN) -- Conservative commentator Glenn Beck says his revival-style rally at the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday was about restoring America's honor and returning the country to the values on which it was founded. Tens of thousands of people showed up for the event, which also featured former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Beck insists the rally was nonpolitical, but the event, which took place on the 47th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, and in the same place, was not without controversy. The message: Support the troops; return to God. Beck said his role was to wake America up to the backsliding of principles, values and most importantly, faith. His speech took on a spiritual tone as Beck urged the country to ""turn back to God."" ""Look forward. Look West. Look to the heavens. Look to God and make your choice,"" he said. Beck told Fox News, the network that carries his weekday television program, that the rally was meant to reclaim the U.S. civil rights movement ""from politics,"" arguing that the movement was about ""people of faith."" The essence of the movement was about ""people of faith who believe you have an equal right to justice,"" he said in an interview that aired Sunday. Beck says he wanted to reclaim civil rights 'from politics' The controversy: Time and location. People filled the park by the Lincoln Memorial's reflecting pool, in the shadows and echoes of the most pivotal civil rights address in America's history. Some of those who marched with King in the 1960s said Beck had usurped the day for his own political gain. The Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN that Beck was mimicking King and ""humiliating the tradition."" Beck said the site of his rally was appropriate to reflect on the legacy of King, ""the man who stood down on those stairs and gave his life for everyone's right to have a dream."" He also said he was unaware that the rally coincided with the King anniversary when he scheduled the event. Alveda King, a niece of the late civil rights leader, participated in the ""Restoring Honor"" rally, saying that her uncle would have approved of the event. Beck talks faith in rally coinciding with anniversary of King's speech . Beck also came under fire for some of his previous statements, such as his 2009 remark that President Obama ""has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture."" In his Fox interview, taped after Saturday's rally, he said he regretted his remarks about Obama, but said the first African-American president's worldview was shaped by ""Marxism disguised as religion."" The other rally: ""Reclaim the Dream"" of King . Civil rights activists gathered nearby with the Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network in a ""Reclaim the Dream"" rally. Participants marched from a high school in northwest Washington to the site of the future Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial, just a few blocks from the Lincoln Memorial. Speakers insisted that King's vision for America has not been completely fulfilled. ""Don't let anyone tell you that they have the right to take their country back. It's our country, too,"" said Avis Jones Deweaver, executive director of the National Council of Negro Women, making a reference to the Tea Party members attending the Beck rally. ""We will reclaim the dream. It was ours from the beginning. A dream that we will make reality,"" she said. Rally aims to 'Reclaim the Dream' The crowd size: Big. Estimates of the crowd size range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people. The U.S. Park Police no longer makes estimates, so there are no official estimates of events on the National Mall. CBS News commissioned a crowd estimate by the company AirPhotosLive.com. The network reported that AirPhotosLive estimated the crowd at 87,000 people. But they noted that with a margin of error of 9,000, ""between 78,000 and 96,000 attended the rally."" iReport: Photo gallery of faces in the crowd . NBC Nightly News estimated the number of people in attendance as ""tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands."" Fox News, citing organizers, aired a banner characterizing it this way: ""CROWD ATTENDING BECK RALLY ESTIMATED AT OVER 500,000."" The Washington Post quoted Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota as saying, ""We're not going to let anyone get away with saying there were less than a million here today -- because we were witnesses."" On the morning after the rally, Beck himself told Fox News Sunday that he believed the crowd was between 300,000 and 650,000. So how many people were really there? In the end, most people will believe what their own eyes tell them. The one estimate guaranteed to be correct was Beck's own comment making fun of the inevitable controversy: ""I have just gotten word from the media that there are over 1,000 people here today."" Wildly conflicting reports filed about Beck rally crowd size . The impact: To be determined. Beck's speech oozed religious language and evoked the feel of a religious revival. Beck has also begun organizing top conservative religious leaders -- mostly evangelicals -- into a fledgling group called the Black Robed Regiment. Is he a new leader for Christian conservatives? Maybe. Beck's emerging role as a national leader for Christian conservatives is surprising not only because he has until recently stressed a libertarian ideology that is sometimes at odds with so-called family values conservatism, but also because Beck is a Mormon. Many of the evangelicals whom Beck is speaking to and organizing don't believe he is a Christian. Mormons, who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, call themselves Christian. Some evangelicals criticized Christians for partnering with Beck this weekend because of his Mormon faith, provoking a number of evangelical political activists to pen defenses of their decision to join Beck. At rally, Beck positions himself as new leader for Christian conservatives . The prospects for a Beck-Palin ticket: Not likely. Despite the buzz in the blogosphere, Beck says ""not a chance."" ""I have no desire to be president of the United States. Zero desire,"" Beck told Fox. ""I don't think that I would be electable. And there are far too many people that are far smarter than me to be president. I'd like to find one with some honor and integrity. I haven't seen them yet, but they'll show up."" CNN's Dan Gilgoff, Kristi Keck and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Glenn Beck urges the country to ""turn back to God""

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot was charged with murder Friday, acting ""with ferocity and great cruelty"" in the slaying of a 21-year-old student in Lima, Peru, according to court documents. Van der Sloot also was charged with robbery in last week's slaying of Stephany Flores Ramirez, according to a release from the Lima Superior Court of Justice. Judge Juan Buendia Valenzuela ordered that van der Sloot be detained and turned over to penal authorities while awaiting trial. He was transferred to a prison Friday afternoon, America TV showed in a broadcast. The 22-year-old Dutch citizen was considered the main suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba, where van der Sloot lived. He has been arrested twice in connection with the case but was released for lack of evidence. Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case, Peruvian national police said in a statement Thursday. The court also accused three men of failing to report the crime, the release said. Brothers John Williams Aparcana Pisconte and John Oswaldo Aparcana Pisconte, along with Carlos Alberto Uribe Petril, drove van der Sloot from Peru to Chile last week, police said. Van der Sloot was arrested in Chile on June 3 and returned to the next day to Peru, where police say he confessed to killing Flores. Police say that in addition to savagely beating and killing Flores, who had a broken neck, he took money and bank cards from her wallet before fleeing. The robbery charge is related to that accusation. Flores and van der Sloot went to a hotel room registered in his name after playing poker at a nearby casino, police say. Hotel surveillance video shows them entering his room together and him leaving alone more than three hours later. In the Holloway case, van der Sloot told investigators during an interrogation that he knows the location of her body, a Peruvian police official said. But van der Sloot would not identify the location or say what happened to her the night of her disappearance, said Miguel Canlla, head of the homicide division of the Peruvian national police investigative unit. ""In the interrogation done to the Dutch citizen, he says he knew the location of the corpse of the American citizen but that he was going to explain everything to Aruban police,"" Canlla said Thursday. Canlla said Thursday that Aruban police were not currently in Peru and that he did not know whether Aruban and Peruvian investigators had been in contact. Van der Sloot's lawyer, Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, has said he plans to ask the judge in the case to strike down van der Sloot's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated. Canlla defended his department's interrogation and said van der Sloot's confession was acquired legally. ""The statement was done within all the requirements stipulated by Peruvian law,"" he said. Canlla said investigators were still waiting for judicial permission in order to investigate the contents of van der Sloot's computer. But authorities have gathered significant evidence, he said. Bloodstains found on van der Sloot's clothes match Flores' blood type, he said. ""We found bloodstains on the victim's clothes, and we found bloodstains on his clothes, which, according to biological testing, they correspond to the victim,"" he said. Police said in a statement Thursday that van der Sloot presumably attacked Flores to rob her of the money she had won gambling at a casino. The two met playing poker May 27 and had several encounters before driving together to van der Sloot's hotel May 30. After killing her, the police statement said, van der Sloot cleaned the room in an attempt to hide evidence of the crime, changed clothes and fled with Flores' money, bank cards and black Jeep. Police said the evidence against van der Sloot includes his confession, forensic data, surveillance videos and fingerprints from the crime scene and Flores' Jeep. Altez, van der Sloot's lawyer, claims he has found indications that the handling of the evidence was tainted, especially the way the body was handled during the crime scene investigation. But Canlla said there were no irregularities in the investigation. Although van der Sloot was never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance in 2005, U.S. authorities have filed extortion and wire fraud charges against him. A FBI affidavit says van der Sloot tried to extort money from Holloway's mother. The FBI says a representative for Holloway's mother paid $25,000 last month for information on the whereabouts of her daughter's remains. Van der Sloot said he would reveal the location of the body and the circumstances surrounding Holloway's death for $25,000 in cash and asked for $250,000 in total, the document states. The FBI and U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham, Alabama, arranged for a meeting in which van der Sloot was paid $10,000 in cash and another $15,000 in a wire transfer, the affidavit said. The meeting took place last month, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham. The FBI affidavit says the $15,000 was transferred to a personal bank account in the Netherlands. In exchange for the money, the document said, van der Sloot showed the representative a house where Holloway's remains supposedly were buried. When records and aerial photography showed that construction had not started on the house at the time of the disappearance, van der Sloot admitted that he lied, the affidavit said. John Kelly, an attorney for Holloway's mother, has said he is the unnamed person mentioned in the FBI affidavit as having taken the money to Aruba and met with van der Sloot. A source with intimate knowledge of the case confirmed for CNN that Kelly is the cooperating witness named in the affidavit. The money paid to van der Sloot came from Holloway's mother, Kelly said. According to the affidavit, van der Sloot said his father helped him conceal Holloway's body and buried it under the house a few days later while van der Sloot waited in a car. ""Van der Sloot added that he had not actually seen his father inter the remains but was told and shown by his father where the body was buried,"" the affidavit states. Van der Sloot's father, Paulus, died in February while playing tennis in Aruba. He was an attorney and judge and had been involved in his son's defense in the Holloway case.

"The top Republican leading the charge against Obamacare is now signed up for it and will take thousands of dollars in government support to help with its costs, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner confirmed to CNN. Boehner's premiums for his new plan under the Affordable Care Act will nearly double from his current monthly payments, even with the federal contribution. All of this was set in motion last week when the Speaker enrolled for coverage on the D.C. exchange established under the health reforms championed by President Barack Obama but opposed by Republicans on Capitol Hill. Boehner said the experience was ""pretty frustrating"" and his office sent pictures of him trying to log onto the website, the rocky rollout of which has been a rallying point for renewed Republican criticism of the law as unworkable. Once he got through the system, Boehner's office said he chose an individual plan that was similar to the Blue Cross Blue Shield one he has now as part of the federal employees health package. If members of Congress want health coverage facilitated by the government acting as their employer, they now must sign up with Obamacare. Boehner saw an eye-popping jump in cost as he moved from a plan set up for millions of federal workers to the D.C. exchange, which is designed for small businesses and individuals. The current cost for Boehner and his wife? They ""pay a monthly premium of $433,"" said Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. The new plan for the two of them? It ""would cost $802 per month in premiums,"" Buck said. That is an 85% leap. But, Boehner's wife is about to go on Medicare, so he will get an individual plan. That cost? $449 a month. Boehner's office notes he will now be paying more for one person in the Obamacare exchange than he was for two people in the federal employees plan. Deductibles for the Boehners will jump from $700 to about $2,000. Why did Boehner's premium go up so much?  One reason, his age. Obamacare sign-up concerns congressional staff . Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurers can no longer set different prices based on health.  The law instead gives just a few variables they can consider.  At the top of that list is age. Many congressional staffers were shocked to see how much more a 60-year-old staffer would pay for the same plan than a 26-year-old colleague. ""The monthly formula for older workers is a serious, serious hit,"" one congressional employee said at the time. ""In addition to what I'm paying now, it will be another $300 to $400 a month."" Boehner, who turned 64 last week, is at the upper end of the age spectrum for Obamacare. At 65, members can sign up for Medicare. Many may point out that he is also a smoker, a condition for which insurers could charge more under the law.  But, Boehner may be in luck. The D.C. exchange has ruled smoking should be considered a pre-existing condition and insurers in that market cannot increase premiums because of it. But the biggest help for the Speaker is a contribution offered to federal workers on the D.C. exchange to help with premiums. Private employers pick up some of the cost for their employees as well. Boehner's office confirms he will accept the contribution, despite his public push against such assistance for plans covering members of Congress. He will receive $5,113 in federal premium support over the next year. When asked why his boss is accepting the contribution now, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told CNN that ""Washington Democrats chose not to make that change."" CNN pointed out that several other members of Congress chose to return their premium support to the Treasury. Boehner's office did not respond further when asked whether he considered that option.

"(CNN) -- Dutch media expressed concern Tuesday about the prospects of Joran van der Sloot getting a fair trial following his arrest in Peru over the death of a 21-year-old woman. Peruvian authorities say that Van der Sloot has already confessed to killing Stephany Flores Ramirez and could be charged on Tuesday. If convicted of murder he could face up to 35 years in jail. The case has attracted international attention because van der Sloot was twice arrested and released in connection with the disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005. In a comment piece published on Tuesday morning before the alleged confession, Dutch newspaper Trouw warned that police and authorities in Peru were under ""overwhelming pressure"" from the media to condemn van der Sloot, as soon as possible, warning that his presumed guilt appeared to be a ""foregone conclusion"" which risked turning his case into a ""show trial."" It also criticized the ""openness"" of the Peruvian police in placing van der Sloot in front of television cameras wearing a bulletproof vest, warning that it could compromise the case against the suspect. ""Showing the suspect as a trophy could seriously harm the investigation. It could influence witnesses before they are heard,"" said Trouw. Trouw also criticized Dutch forensic psychology professor Corine de Ruiter who speculated in another Dutch newspaper, De Volkskrant, that van der Sloot displayed ""all the major features of a classic psychopath."" De Ruiter has not met van der Sloot and told De Volkskrant her suggestion that he may have a psychopathic disorder was based on analysis of ""books, images and interviews"" concerning the case. She cited an interview he gave on Dutch television in 2008 following which he threw a glass of wine into the face of crime reporter Peter R. de Vries. Psychopathic personality disorder is a chronic mental illness also known as antisocial personality disorder. Those with the condition ""typically have no regard for right and wrong"" and may be prone to violent behavior, according to MayoClinic.com. De Ruiter told the newspaper that typical psychopathic characteristics included a lack of empathy and guilt, manipulative tendencies, pathological lying and narcissism. ""Psychopaths have a certain flair. They have wit, and they can also be very charming and polite,"" de Ruiter said. But Trouw, in the opinion piece published before van der Sloot's alleged confession, said: ""What if he is still proven innocent? On closer inspection, the 22-year-old Dutchman is just a suspect in an 'ordinary' murder investigation. So he must be treated. Until the court has sentenced, after thorough deliberation."" That sentiment was echoed by the Web site of the English language Radio Netherlands Worldwide which voiced concerns about the amount of possible evidence which had already been made public. It noted that van der Sloot was ""already a well-known figure in the United States, the Netherlands and in Aruba."" ""Generally, the Netherlands never interferes with legal processes in other countries, but there may well be reason to protest in this case,"" it said. Radio Netherlands Worldwide said van der Sloot's alleged confession over the killing of Flores was a ""surprise"" as van der Sloot had previosly refused to say anything about his alleged involvement. ""For Peru, Joran van der Sloot is principally a matter of prestige,"" the Web site said. ""His rights and privacy are secondary to the country's desire to show off to the world with its handling of the Stephany Flores murder case.""

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot, the Dutch man once considered a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, is the suspect in the killing of a woman in Peru, Peruvian police officials said Wednesday. Authorities in neighboring Chile are on a manhunt for van der Sloot, who fled there, Chile Interpol Deputy Prefect Eugenio Buines Arevalo told CNN. Chilean police are looking for van der Sloot in various hotels and other overnight accommodations in the border region with Peru, he said. Van der Sloot will be extradited to Peru if captured, he said. Police also are checking border and customs checkpoints. As of Wednesday there were no sightings of the suspect, and police were investigating if van der Sloot went deeper into Chile, Buines said. There is ""incriminating evidence"" linking van der Sloot to the killing of 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez, who was found with multiple stab wounds in a Lima hotel room Wednesday, Cesar Guardia Vasquez, of the criminal investigations unit, said at a news conference. The hotel room where Flores was found was registered in van der Sloot's name, he said. A hotel guest and an employee witnessed the pair entering the hotel room together at 5 a.m. on Sunday, Guardia said. Police have video of the previous night, May 29, of van der Sloot and Flores together at the Atlantic City Casino in Lima, he said. According to immigration officials, van der Sloot fled to Chile over land on Monday, Guardia said. ""We have all the evidence to show that the killer is this man,"" the victim's father, businessman and race-car driver Ricardo Flores told CNN en Español. But van der Sloot's attorney, Joseph Tacopina, told CNN it was too early to make any conclusions. ""If history teaches us any lesson from van der Sloot/Holloway case, it's that there have been way too many false facts that have been leaked and rumors that have been proven untrue,"" Tacopina said. ""We need to take a step back. I have not been contacted and the family has not been contacted. Joran has not been asked by anyone to surrender."" Ricardo Flores said that police found his daughter's car about 50 blocks from the hotel, and that inside, they found pills like those used in date rape cases. Similar to the Holloway case, van der Sloot and Flores allegedly met at a night spot, in this case, a casino. Ricardo Flores said he did not believe that his daughter knew the Dutch citizen from before. Both of them speak English, and at the casino they struck up conversation, he said. Interpol has alerted its office in Chile and other bordering countries of the case and placed them on alert in case van der Sloot tries to leave that country, Peruvian Interpol Interim Director Gerson Ortiz told CNN. An international arrest warrant could be issued in the next 48 hours, he said. In 2005, van der Sloot was arrested in Aruba along with two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe, in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway. In 2007, they were arrested a second time after Aruba's then-chief prosecutor, Hans Mos, said he had received new evidence in the case. Van der Sloot, who was attending college in the Netherlands, was brought back to Aruba. But judges ruled the new evidence -- which included an Internet chat the same day Holloway disappeared with one of the three youths saying she was dead -- was not enough to keep them jailed. In 2008, prosecutors sought unsuccessfully to arrest van der Sloot a third time after a videotape surfaced on Dutch television. In it, van der Sloot tells a man he considered to be his friend that he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub, then she ""started shaking"" and lost consciousness. He said he panicked when he could not resuscitate her and called a friend who had a boat. The two put Holloway's body in the boat, he said, and then he went home. The friend told him the next day that he had carried the body out and dumped it in the ocean. But an Aruba court ruled there was not enough evidence to re-arrest him. Aruban prosecutors said authorities had met with van der Sloot in the Netherlands, but in a two-hour interview he denied any role in Holloway's disappearance.

"(CNN) -- Roma defender Leandro Castan underwent successful neurosurgery Wednesday, having previously complained of acute dizziness during an Italian Serie A match in September. Castan reported the problem during halftime of his side's 1-0 victory against Empoli, and after facing tests earlier this month, he went under the knife to remove the cavernoma -- a cluster of abnormal blood vessels -- in his brain. The three-and-a-half-hour procedure was ""carried out using a surgical microscope and neuronavigator,"" according to an official Roma statement, while the player's ""neurophysiological activity was constantly monitored."" The cavernoma, which measured three centimeters, was ""completely removed."" The statement added: ""Castan has now woken up and is breathing unaided, and has been informed of the operation's successful outcome. ""He will remain in intensive care for the next 24 hours, after which a prognosis will be formed."" While Wednesday's operation should ensure that Castan will be able to play football again, reports suggest that he will not be ready to return to action for up to eight months. The 28-year-old, who arrived at Roma from Corinthians in 2012, has made just one appearance for the Italian Serie A club this season, having been sidelined since being substituted at halftime against Empoli. Castan has become a key player for Roma since joining, making 36 appearances last term as the club booked their place in Europe's Champions League.","Roma's Leandro Castan undergoes successful neurosurgery .

"(CNN)  -- After weeks of criticism that she was being too elusive, Senate hopeful Caroline Kennedy is now talking about why she believes she is the best person for the job. Caroline Kennedy says she is the best person to replace Hillary Clinton in the Senate. In a media blitz this weekend, Kennedy sought to explain what sets her apart from the handful of other people being considered for Hillary Clinton's Senate seat. ""I would be an unconventional choice -- I haven't followed a traditional path, but I think I bring a lifetime of experience to this,"" she told NY1. She also told The New York Times that ""there's a lot of different ways that people are coming to public life now, and it's not only the traditional path."" Asked if she thinks she's the best fit, Kennedy told the Times, ""Well, I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I would be the best."" New York Gov. David Paterson has the sole responsibility of picking Clinton's replacement. His pick would serve for two years before running for election in 2010. If the candidate won that contest, he or she would have to run again in 2012, when Clinton's term ends. If Paterson selects Kennedy, it would mean the continuation of a Kennedy legacy in the Senate that began 56 years ago with the election of her father, John F. Kennedy, as the junior senator from Massachusetts. But some are questioning whether she's ready to follow the path taken by her father and her two uncles.  Watch Kennedy explain why she should be in the Senate » . Kennedy, 51, has been involved in education reform and women's issues but has never held public office and has mostly stayed out of the public spotlight. Hank Sheinkopf, who worked for President Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, said name recognition does not make Kennedy qualified for the job. ""Does she have name recognition? So does Jennifer Lopez,"" Sheinkopf said. ""The Senate seat is not a legacy place. We haven't had a Kennedy elected to office from New York state since 1964, and a lot of people would like to keep it that way,"" he said, referring to Caroline's uncle Robert Kennedy. Kennedy has insisted that she brings more to the table than her name. ""If my last name was not Kennedy, maybe I would have run for office a long time ago,"" she told NY1.  ""I'm proud of my family tradition. It means a lot to me. That's something that I want to live up to, and that's why I feel that I've been preparing myself to do this. But it isn't fundamentally about me --  it's about who can do the best job for the people of New York --  who Gov. Paterson thinks can do the best job for delivering for the people of New York."" But now that she is publicly seeking the seat, her name does make it easy for her to get attention, according to Lynn Sweet, the Washington bureau chief for the Chicago Sun-Times. ""This is the megaphone of the Kennedy celebrity. This is one -- this is the most famous political family in America, the legendary family,"" she said. ""What's interesting here, one of the other people who would like to be appointed, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, he comes from another big New York political family, but, yes, it's hard even for him even to be heard."" Cuomo is the son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. He is one of New Yorkers' top choices for the seat, according to recent polls. A new national poll suggest that just over half of Americans think Kennedy has the necessary qualifications, with 52 percent saying she is qualified and 42 percent saying she is not. Read what Americans think about Kennedy . The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey, released Monday, also shows a gender gap -- with 57 percent of women saying she's qualified, compared with 47 percent among men. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. ""Men may think of qualifications for public office in terms of work experience, while women may be looking at a candidate's life experience,"" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. ""Caroline Kennedy has a personal history that may be compelling to many women, but her résumé is not very long, and that may be a mark against her to some men."" The mother of three has spent most of her life in New York City, working there after graduating from Harvard, meeting her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, on the job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and attending Columbia Law School there. Her most prominent public roles to date involved overseeing her father's presidential library and presenting the annual Profiles in Courage Award. Most of her leadership positions have been based in the arts: hosting the annual nationally televised Kennedy Center Honors in Washington and serving as the honorary chairwoman of the American Ballet Theatre, as her mother had. Sweet, of the Sun-Times, said there's no clear path to the Senate, so it's hard to compare résumés for the job. ""We know that people come to this from all walks of life. There is no one qualification for Senate,"" she said. Kennedy has said she's always considered political office, but was finally moved to action after working on President-elect Barack Obama's presidential campaign. She endorsed Obama early in the campaign and served on his vice presidential search team. Paterson has said he will not appoint Clinton's replacement until the seat officially becomes vacant.","Caroline Kennedy explains why she thinks she is qualified to be a senator .

"(CNN) -- Bubba Watson might be more accustomed to targeting a hole in one but the Christmas No.1 record appears to be his more immediate goal after the golfer revealed his latest music video. Getting into the swing of Christmas, the two-time Masters winner and self-styled Bubbaclaus appears dressed as Santa -- minus the beard -- in a pair of sunglasses to a rap entitled ""The Single."" Bubbaclaus is a character Watson has employed in the past, using his Twitter page to dish out Christmas presents each year. The record -- his first solo single and music video -- opens to a chorus of ""Hallelujah"" as Watson conducts two elves with a candy can before breaking into his opening rap. All this while on board his custom-made hovercraft golf buggy, which is emblazoned with the initials BW1. The chorus line of the single is: ""I bet you want to know what's in my bag. Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys? It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Bubbaclaus."" Among the other lyrical gifts are the words: ""No sled, no beard, no reindeer. I might put my little gifts on a John Deere,"" all belted out while driving a miniature tractor. His latest musical venture comes in the same week in which world No.1 Rory McIlroy warned that golf needed to do more to attract a younger generation of players to the game. Watson is no stranger to singing on camera having twice appeared alongside fellow golfers Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan as mock band The Golf Boys.

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama laid out his plan for change in America as he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday night, securing his place in history as the first African-American to lead a major party ticket. Sen. Barack Obama accepted his party's nomination for the presidency Thursday night. ""Change happens because the American people demand it -- because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time. America, this is one of those moments,"" he told supporters at the Democratic National Convention. ""I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming."" Obama pitted himself against John McCain, repeatedly countering attacks from his Republican rival while casting the election as a choice between change and failure, as he addressed tens of thousands of cheering people and millions of primetime TV viewers. McCain would continue the policies of the Bush administration, Obama said. ""We are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight. On November 4, we must stand up and say: 'Eight is enough,' "" he told the Denver throng. In addition to slamming McCain on Iraq, energy policy and health care, Obama said his rival for the White House is out of touch with the concerns of the average American. Watch Obama's entire speech:  Part 1 » |  Part 2 » . ""He said that our economy has made 'great progress' under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers -- the man who wrote his economic plan -- was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a 'mental recession,' and that we've become, and I quote, 'a nation of whiners,' "" Obama said, eliciting boos from the crowd. ""It's not because John McCain doesn't care,"" Obama said. ""It's because John McCain doesn't get it.""  Watch Obama blast the status quo » . The speech marked the culmination of the four-day convention in Denver, during which party leaders pushed to heal the rift from a bitter and prolonged primary battle between Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton. By Thursday, Obama had received clear endorsements from Clinton and her husband former President Bill Clinton.  Watch highlights from the convention » . By early evening, the line of people seeking to get into Invesco Field to hear Obama's address stretched for six miles, and the crowd that filled the stadium was more than 80,000 strong. ""I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring,"" Obama told the audience. ""What the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's about you.""  Watch Obama accept the historic nomination » . In a statement issued immediately after the speech, the McCain campaign called the speech ""misleading"" and said it was ""fundamentally at odds with the meager record of Barack Obama."" ""When the temple comes down, the fireworks end, and the words are over, the facts remain: Sen. Obama still has no record of bipartisanship, still opposes offshore drilling, still voted to raise taxes on those making just $42,000 per year, and still voted against funds for American troops in harm's way. The fact remains: Barack Obama is still not ready to be president,"" said a statement from the campaign. The ""temple"" is a reference to the columns that formed the backdrop for Obama's speech. Grade Obama's speech . Obama also outlined his promises for the nation -- vowing to cut taxes, end the country's dependence on oil from the Middle East and offer affordable healthcare for all Americans.

""It was an excellent home run,"" said Matt Besser, an Obama representative to the DNC platform committee. ""He did everything he needed to do.

The scene was much like a rock concert, with the foot-stomping, flag-waving crowd dancing and bouncing beach balls as they awaited Obama's arrival. When Obama officially locked in his party's nomination on Wednesday, delegates sobbed, cheered and hugged in celebration of the historic moment. The Democratic candidate's address fell on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I have a dream"" speech. In an emotional tribute to the slain civil rights leader earlier in the evening, King's children paid respect to their father and said he would have been proud of the party and the generation that would realize his dream. Civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., son of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, were seen hugging each other and weeping. McCain also honored Obama's achievement in a television ad that aired during the convention.

"(CNN) -- The city of Seattle will pay $1.5 million to the family of a man who was fatally shot by a police officer last year. A Seattle police officer shot and killed John T. Williams, described as belonging to a First Nations Tribe, on August 30. Williams, a woodcarver, was seen on video crossing a street holding his carving knife. When he didn't drop it, the officer shot him. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was unclear whether Williams, who was partially deaf, heard the order. The Seattle Police Department ruled the shooting unjustified. The officer, Ian Birk, resigned. Last month, the Justice Department launched a federal investigation of the police department for possible excessive use of force and discriminatory policing. Although the Seattle Police Department has been plagued by several reports of improper arrests and unwarranted beatings that led to a preliminary review, federal officials insisted the probe was not triggered by any specific incidents or allegations. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Tom Perez and the U.S. attorney in Seattle, Jenny Durkan, emphasized the investigation is civil, not criminal. They said rather than seeking to resolve any specific cases, the ""pattern or practice"" investigation will focus on Seattle police systems of enforcement and on policy changes that may need to be made. Perez said the probe will be much narrower than a similar investigation of the New Orleans Police Department, but noted Seattle and New Orleans have both fully cooperated with federal authorities. The officials stressed that neither the federal preliminary review nor the full ""pattern or practice"" investigation announced Thursday had been triggered by a letter from the ACLU and more than 30 civil rights groups calling for a full-blown investigation. Perez said the preliminary review had started when the Justice Department received the letter in early December. In addition to the fatal shooting of Williams, that letter cited five alleged incidents of particular concern that the ACLU claims require a wide-ranging investigation: . -- June 11 2009: An African-American man being released from jail was tackled, kicked in the face and beaten with a baton by three officers, according to the ACLU letter. -- April 17, 2010: Police stopped a Latino man they believed might be a robbery suspect. Video shows that while the man was lying on the sidewalk, an officer kicked him in the face and threatened to beat him. Another officer then stepped on his legs, the letter says. -- April 24, 2010: One of the same officers involved in that incident arrested a young man after a bar fight. The man was handcuffed, placed in the back of a patrol car, where, he claims, the officer repeatedly choked him, the civil rights groups allege. -- June 14, 2010: A police officer saw young people jaywalking and confronted a teenage African-American girl. The letter says video of the incident shows that after she put her hands on him, the officer punched the girl in the face. -- October 18, 2010: A convenience store camera shows an African-American teenager with his hands in the air being kicked by a police officer, causing him to fall to the ground. After he was kicked several more times, the teenager was handcuffed by a second officer, according to the letter.","The woodcarver was crossing a street with a knife .

"Washington (CNN) -- Prodded by growing public frustration over sharply rising gasoline prices, the Justice Department on Thursday announced the formation of a team -- the ""Oil and Gas Price Fraud Working Group -- tasked with the goal of ensuring consumers are not victims of price gouging. Gas prices exceeding $4 per gallon or higher are ""tough"" for most Americans, President Barack Obama told an audience in Reno, Nevada. ""We are going to make sure that no one is taking advantage of American consumers for their own short-term gain."" ""This gas issue is serious,"" the president said. ""It hurts."" CNNMoney: Why is gas outpacing oil in price? Attorney General Eric Holder made no secret the move is a direct response to public angst, not to current evidence of any illegal conduct.

Gas price jumped while he was still pumping . ""We will be vigilant in monitoring the oil and gas markets for any wrongdoing so that consumers can be confident they are not paying higher prices as a result of illegal activity,"" he said.

The new working group will be composed of representatives of the Justice Department, the National Association of (State) Attorneys General, the Treasury Department, the Energy Department, and several financial regulatory agencies. Holder said he is asking the group to explore ""whether there is any evidence of manipulation of oil and gas prices, collusion, fraud, or misrepresentations at the retail or wholesale levels that would violate state or federal laws."" iReport: What are gas prices like where you live?

"(CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama formally announced Sunday that retired Army Gen. Eric Shinseki, a decorated veteran and popular figure among critics of the Bush administration, is his pick to be secretary of Veterans Affairs. Retired Gen. Eric Shinseki Sunday promised to work for veterans ""each and every day."" ""There is no one more distinguished, more determined, or more qualified to build this VA than the leader I am announcing as our next secretary of Veterans Affairs -- Gen. Eric Shinseki,"" Obama said at a press conference. ""No one will ever doubt that this former Army chief of staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans. No one will ever question whether he will fight hard enough to make sure they have the support they need,"" Obama added. Obama said the nation must focus on helping troops who have served their country especially during bad economic times. ""We don't just need to better serve veterans of today's wars. We also need to build a 21st century VA that will better serve all who have answered our nation's call,"" Obama said.  Watch Obama talk about Shinseki » . Obama said Shinseki, who served two combat tours in Vietnam and lost part of his foot, ""understands the changing needs of our troops and their families. And he will be a VA secretary who finally modernizes our VA to meet the challenges of our time."" Shinseki, who spoke after Obama, made a vow to his fellow veterans. If confirmed, he said, he will ""work each and every day"" to ensure the nation is serving them ""as well as you have served us."" The official announcement took place in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, the anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. In an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Obama called Shinseki ""exactly the right person"" for the post. Host Tom Brokaw said Shinseki lost his job in the Bush administration ""because he said that we would need more troops in Iraq than the secretary of defense, Don Rumsfeld, thought that we would need at that time."" ""He was right,"" Obama replied. Veterans groups appeared to support the selection. ""I am excited. I don't know him personally but this is a huge move,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. For years, Shinseki, a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, has been cited as an example by Pentagon critics who say the former Army chief's sage advice was ignored in 2003, resulting in too few U.S. troops being sent to Iraq after the invasion. Shinseki testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2003 that ""something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers would be required"" to pacify the country. The comment infuriated some Bush administration officials, and he retired just a few months later. Shinseki has never spoken publicly about his testimony, which has often been cited by critics as evidence that Rumsfeld ignored the advice of one of his key generals. But as Army chief of staff, Shinseki was not in the chain of command, and played no direct role in drawing up the war plans. Pentagon sources say that, in fact, Shinseki never advocated higher troop levels for Iraq, in part because it was not his job to do so. And sources say that just before the invasion, when asked by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Richard Myers if he agreed with the war plans, Shinseki voiced no objections. Still, Rieckhoff said, ""Shinseki is a guy who had a career putting patriotism above politics. He is a wounded veteran so he understands the plight of veterans."" iReport.com: What do you think of Obama's cabinet picks so far? He said Shinseki would have to make key connections with the veterans community, adding, ""This is a big name and it shows that he [Obama] is not going to treat the Veterans Affairs secretary as a low priority."" John Rowan, president of Vietnam Veterans of America, called the reported pick an ""interesting choice."" ""I am satisfied with it,"" Rowan told CNN on Saturday, adding that the choice seems to be in the Obama transition team's pattern of ""bringing in strong personalities into all the positions who aren't going to 'yes' him to death."" ""When Shinseki had his disagreements with the administration, he wasn't afraid to speak up,"" Rowan said. Veterans for Common Sense also weighed in, issuing a statement ""strongly"" supporting Shinseki. ""In February 2003, Gen. Shinseki honestly and correctly assessed our nation's military needs before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003,"" the statement said. ""This same level of candor and honesty will serve President-elect Obama well so he can quickly and accurately identify VA's many challenges and then implement responsible solutions that take into consideration our veterans' needs and concerns.""

"Dr. Craig Spencer, who was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City last month, is now free of the virus and will be released from the hospital Tuesday, city officials said. ""Dr. Spencer poses no public health risk and will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow,"" the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation said in a statement Monday. Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician, became the first person to test positive for the deadly virus in the city when he was diagnosed last month after returning from treating patients in Guinea. Officials said Spencer, 33, was hospitalized after developing a fever, nausea, pain and fatigue. He has been in isolation at New York's Bellevue Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment. Word that Spencer went for a jog, traveled the city's vast subway system and went bowling before his diagnosis sparked fears that the number of Ebola cases could grow in the city, but authorities stressed that the risk of him spreading the virus was low. After being released, he is expected to go to his apartment in the New York City neighborhood of Hamilton Heights. New York's mayor, hospital and health officials are scheduled to hold a press conference Wednesday to discuss the doctor's discharge. Spencer is also set to speak, officials. The physician, who is employed at New York's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, began work on a number of projects in Africa in recent years, including in Rwanda where he worked to help develop an emergency care teaching curriculum. He completed his work treating Ebola patients in Guinea on October 12 and left Africa two days later via Europe, arriving at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on October 17. He was diagnosed with Ebola on October 23 -- the same day he contacted Doctors Without Borders to report that he had a fever.

"Afghan security forces stormed a bank branch besieged by insurgents in Helmand province Wednesday, ending a deadly attack, police said. Five civilians, one police officer and two army soldiers were killed, said Farid Ahmad Obaid, a spokesman for the police chief of southern Helmand province. Fourteen others, nine civilians among them, were wounded, Obaid said. He warned that the death toll could go up since at least one of those injured was in critical condition. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on the Kabul Bank office in the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said via Twitter that the target was Afghan security forces personnel who were visiting the bank to receive their monthly salary. All the attackers were killed in the operation to end the siege, Obaid said. The four armed insurgents attacked shortly before noon, he said. The first attacker, who was riding a motorbike, blew himself up outside the bank branch, while three others stormed inside the building, he said. Obaid said the gunbattle between the Afghan security forces and the assailants lasted about 90 minutes before the militants were killed. Meanwhile, a suspected drone strike Tuesday killed 11 Taliban in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province, near the border with Pakistan, a local Afghan government official told CNN on Wednesday. Among those killed in the strike in Sherzad district were four Pakistanis and two midlevel Afghan Taliban officials, said Malem Mashuq, the district chief. It's not clear if the strike was linked to Tuesday's shocking attack by the Pakistan Taliban on an army-run school in Peshawar, northwestern Pakistan, in which 145 people were killed, 132 of them children. Analysts say the Afghan and Pakistan Taliban groups are closely affiliated, often sharing resources and jointly plotting attacks on either side of the porous border. However, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban condemned the Peshawar attack Tuesday because it involved the ""deliberate killing of innocent people, women and children."" Separately, two bomb explosions Wednesday morning in Nangarhar's capital city, Jalalabad, targeted Afghan police vehicles, killing two Afghan policemen and injuring five others, said Zia Abdulzai, a spokesman for the provincial governor. The continuing violence comes as Afghan security forces prepare to take on greater responsibility for ensuring the country's security as international forces transition to a supporting role.

"(CNN) -- A storm has killed at least 16 people on the Italian island of Sardinia, with two people unaccounted for and fears the death toll will rise, officials say. Confirming the deaths to CNN affiliate Sky TG24, Regional President Ugo Cappellacci described the situation as ""dramatic"" and ""critical."" Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta held a Cabinet meeting to declare a state of emergency in Sardinia. He told reporters the government has allocated 20 million euros ($27 million) in immediate aid to the Mediterranean island. The money will be used to help save lives, assist the displaced and repair roads, he said. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano issued a statement expressing solidarity with the affected communities. Civil Protection Agency spokeswoman Francesca Maffini said that the two missing people were a farmer and a woman who lived alone. Both were in the province of Nuoro, she said. Maffini told CNN the island had received six months' worth of rainfall -- 450 mm (more than a foot) -- in 12 hours. Addressing lawmakers in Italy's Parliament on Tuesday, Environment Minister Andrea Orlando said the area had an average rainfall of 1,000 mm, and a similar deluge had not occurred there in centuries. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said that while the worst weather had moved on from Sardinia, the island will still experience some showers and gusty winds over 50 kph through Wednesday as the storm system moves east in the Mediterranean Sea. Italy's state news agency ANSA reported that flooding from the storm -- named locally as Cleopatra -- forced many people to flee their homes, with thousands seeking shelter in public facilities such as gymnasiums. ANSA said a Brazilian family of four was among the dead: a mother, father and two teenage children drowned when a flash flood hit their ground-floor flat in Arzachena, near Olbia. Olbia's councilor for tourism, Marco Vargiu, told CNN that the storm had been ""a disaster"" for the town of about 70,000, with authorities saying 13 people had died in the broader area. Vargiu said the dead included two young babies. In one case, a father aged 35 and his 3-year-old son had died in flood waters near the town, he said. ""The worst conditions are here in Olbia. There are rivers of water in the town. In lots of houses the ground floors are full of water, one or two meters of water, and a lot of families have lost everything -- their house, their car, their clothes, the furniture."" Vargiu said the houses were filled with a mixture of water, sand and rubbish. ""We have electricity, but the streets, the bridges have been washed away."" ""My house has no damage, but just 15 meters away there are friends that have lost all their furniture, their car, because they were carried away by the rivers,"" he said. ""Disasters like this have never happened. We don't remember a disaster like this."" But Vargiu said a lot of ministry staff and emergency workers had come to aid the town, and there were many volunteers helping its inhabitants. ""In Olbia there is a very, very good solidarity,"" he said. ""We have two hospitals working hard overnight and today because they had a lot of people asking for help. There were a lot of accidents in cars, in houses, and some walls fell down."" Vargiu said a lot of money would be needed for Sardinia to recover from the storm, with many families and businesses affected. The amount offered by the government might be enough to restore some of the town's connections to the rest of the island, he said, but it was not enough long term. ""It's very difficult to count the financial cost to the town, the houses. The economy of the town has received a big damage. I don't think it's enough."" Italy's Civil Protection Agency said 2,500 people have been displaced and more than 10,000 people are without electricity. The agency is still trying to reach all the areas affected, it said in a statement. Widespread flooding and landslides have blocked roads, and the agency urged motorists to drive only when necessary and to check road conditions before beginning a journey. The agency said the bad weather started in the Campidano area, in southwestern Sardinia, then spread across the rest of the island, with the worst affected provinces Olbia and Nuoro. Olbia's port remains operational, and the airport is partially open, it said. The coast guard said there had been reports of flooding in other parts of Italy, particularly near the city of Catanzaro, in the southern region of Calabria, and in Venice during the high tide.","Italian PM Enrico Letta declares emergency, allocates 20 million euros in immediate aid .

"(CNN) -- He's one of the world's most famous boxers but this could be Amir Khan's toughest fight yet. Khan landed in Pakistan on Wednesday and promised to help rebuild the school in Peshawar where 132 children were killed by the Taliban in the country's deadliest-ever terror attack. The British boxer, who has Pakistani roots, announced his intention set up boxing academies for youngsters in the country, while the sale of his $45,000 shorts will help to rebuild the school. ""What has taken place in Peshawar is absolutely horrific and sickening,"" the WBC welterweight world champion told a news conference in Islamabad. ""After recently becoming a father myself, I can't imagine how the families of these innocent children are feeling."" ""The main reason I came to Pakistan was to show the world that Pakistan is a safe place, and it's a place I love coming to and you know, we want to all fight against terrorism."" Gunmen stormed the army-run school in the city of Peshawar, which is in the north west of the country, earlier this month. Khan, 28, announced his intention to help rebuild the school following his successful title defense against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas earlier this month. He became a father last May when his daughter Lamysa was born and wants to help the survivors following the tragic event. Speaking to British media ahead of the trip to Pakistan, Khan revealed the timing of his trip was vitally important. ""Talking about this stuff could be threatening for me, but I just want to speak the truth and tell people what is happening is wrong,"" he said. ""I think it's more important now than ever to go over there. I think it will send a statement to a lot of people that Amir Khan is going there to make a difference. ""I want it to be a better country. It's just a shame -- I cannot believe how sick some people are."" Pakistan has seen plenty of violence, much of it involving militants based in provinces such as South Waziristan, North Waziristan and the Khyber Agency -- all restive regions in northwest Pakistan near Peshawar along its border with Afghanistan. It is the home base of the TTP, an organization that has sought to force its conservative version of Islam in Pakistan. The group has battled Pakistani troops and, on a number of occasions, attacked civilians as well. Peshawar, an ancient city of more than three million people tucked right up against the Khyber Pass, has often found itself in the center of it all. Militants repeatedly targeted the city in response to Pakistani military offensives, like a 2009 truck bombing of a popular marketplace frequented by women and children that killed more than 100 people. And the Taliban hasn't hesitated to go after schoolchildren. Their most notable target is Malala Yousafzai, who was singled out and shot on October 9, 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls. The teenage girl survived and, this year, became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote education and girls' rights in Pakistan and beyond. Yousafzai was ""heartbroken by this (latest) senseless and cold blooded act of terror in Peshawar,"" saying that ""innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this."" ""I call upon the international community, leaders in Pakistan, all political parties -- everyone -- (to) stand up together and fight against terrorism,"" the 16-year-old added in another statement.

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- At least 39 civilians were killed in Somalia's capital Monday after a convoy of African Union peacekeepers was hit by a roadside bomb, causing the troops to open fire, officials and eyewitnesses said. Islamist militia display weapons Monday in defiance of newly elected President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. Maj. Ba-Huko Barigye, spokesman to the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISON), said an explosion targeted a contingent of Ugandan troops. At least one soldier was injured and one of the vehicles damaged, Barigye said. Ahmed Dirie Ali, spokesman of Hawiye Traditional Elders -- a major group of local clan leaders -- condemned the civilian deaths. And Mogadishu's deputy mayor, Abdifatah Ibrahim Shaweye, accused AMISOM of killing innocent civilians deliberately during a ""brutal attack,"" an allegation Barigye denied. ""The deputy mayor has got the wrong information,"" he said. ""They are targeting AMISOM, but the people who have died are all Somali civilians, who have nothing, whatsoever to do with AMISOM."" Officials say the incident happened on Maka al-Mukarama road, which connects the presidential palace and the airport in southern Mogadishu. The incident occurred on the same day that the new Somali president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, was attending an African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Ethiopia invaded Somalia in 2006, to depose an Islamic government led by Ahmed that had taken control of Mogadishu. But at the summit, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged continued support for national reconciliation efforts in Somalia, which has been without an effective central government since 1991. ""It is important that these efforts should have a tangible effect in improving the security environment for the Somali people and humanitarian actors,"" Ban said in a statement released by his office. ""The United Nations will provide strong logistical support to the African Union's AMISOM force and help develop Somali security forces."" He also encouraged AU leaders to consider a plan that will incorporate AMISOM into a larger U.N. peacekeeping force in the months ahead. AMISOM was set up to take over from Ethiopian forces, which were supposed to be withdrawn soon after the December 2006 invasion that deposed the Islamic Courts Union, which Ahmed once led. But the Ethiopians and the country's U.N.-backed transitional government were soon battling Islamist guerrillas, including the militia al-Shabaab -- which the United States has designated as a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda. The transitional government eventually signed a peace agreement with a new movement led by Ahmed, the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. But al-Shabaab has rejected the deal and continued fighting. The militia overran the town of Baidoa, the seat of the transitional government, within hours of the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops last week. Ahmed was elected president Saturday by lawmakers in Djibouti, and many Somalis view him as a final hope to challenge the militia and its extremist ideology. CNN's Amir Ahmed and Ahmednor Mohamed Farah for CNN contributed to this report.","Roadside bomb strikes African Union peacekeepers, AU mission says .

Once I got the phone back, I started to get text messages and calls from what seemed like every news outlet. The first call that I took was from MSNBC. I was very surprised that it went viral the way that it did. I posted to my 170 followers and did not send it to any news outlets. It was incredible to see the power of Twitter and how news can spread around the world in a matter of minutes. CNN: Do you think the iconic Twitpic has specifically led to opportunities for you or contributed to your success? If so, how? Krums: It's been a great story when I talk to people about technology. I've gotten some incredible opportunities to speak at such places as Columbia Journalism School and the Poynter Institute. I'm involved with technology, so I actually became an adviser to Rawporter.com. Their mission is to protect, promote and sell photos and videos from everyday people. CNN: Do you still shoot Twitpics, or do you prefer other photo platforms like Instagram? Please explain. Krums: I actually shoot mostly with Instagram. The reason that in 2009 I used Twitpic was because it was the best and really the only viable site to use for photos on Twitter. I'm always trying new apps, so when I find something that works I stick with it. CNN: What are the types of things you most like to photograph with your mobile device? Krums: I tend to shoot sunsets and other beautiful scenes, random cool things, friends, and you can't go wrong with a good selfie. CNN: What's your favorite photo that you've ever taken? Why? Krums: I would say that the Miracle on the Hudson wins by a large margin. It's an iconic image of an incredible event. What Sully was able to accomplish is truly a miracle.","US Airways Flight 1549 crash landed in the Hudson on January 15, 2009 .

"(CNN) -- The federal government has reopened 4,281 square miles of federal waters off the coast of western Louisiana to commercial and recreational fishing, according to Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The region being reopened represents 7.4 percent of the total area in the Gulf of Mexico that had been closed off prior to Friday. More than 48,000 square miles of federal waters -- roughly 20 percent of the total federal waters in the Gulf -- remain closed to fishermen.  At its height, the fishing ban resulting from the April 20 BP oil rig explosion stretched over 88,000 square miles, or 37 percent of federal Gulf waters, Lubchenco noted. The western Louisiana waters represent the third area in the Gulf to be reopened to fishing.  A region off the Florida peninsula was reopened on July 22, and another area off the Florida panhandle was reopened on August 10, according to Lubchenco. Officials are ""nibbling at the edges"" in terms of reopening the Gulf waters after extensive testing, Lubchenco said, starting with areas that were the least contaminated. ""We feel completely confident that the (Gulf) seafood that is in the market now is safe for human consumption,"" she told reporters.  But we will ""continue to investigate the longer-term impacts this spill may have had."" Lubchenco said that in order for an area of the Gulf to be reopened, no oil can be present or expected to be present in the forseeable future.  Water samples taken from the area must pass both a sensory and chemical analysis. She also stated that the NOAA -- in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency -- will continue to test seafood from reopened areas of the Gulf. In a separate announcement, Louisiana officials stated that a project to monitor shrimp trawling vessels in St. Bernard Parish waters would conclude on Friday. The project began on August 12. ""We've encountered dozens of shrimp vessels at work in St. Bernard Parish,"" said Jeff Dauzat, an environmental scientist with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.  ""All vessels encountered ... have been inspected and no indications of oil have been noted on nets or in the catch."" The federal and state announcements came roughly three weeks after BP plugged its crippled Macondo oil well in the Gulf with cement and mud from above.  Crews are currently ""fishing"" for pieces of drill pipe that need to be removed from inside the well's blowout preventer before crews can move on to the ""bottom kill"" -- the permanent fix for the well. Thad Allen, the man in charge of the government response to the Gulf oil crisis, said Wednesday that the ""fishing"" operations had been delayed by a buildup of hydrates -- chemicals that form at low temperatures and high pressures toward the sea floor -- that temporarily jammed the cap that trapped oil in the well starting on July 15. Crews, however, have now flushed the system to loosen the cap, thereby allowing them to begin ""fishing"" through the top of the well again.","NEW: St. Bernard Parish officials say monitoring of shrimp trawlers shows no oil .

"(CNN) -- The California governor's race has devolved into a skirmish over the word ""whore."" An aide to the Democratic candidate called the Republican candidate that in an inadvertently recorded conversation, implying that she had sold out to special interests. The Republican campaign of former eBay CEO Meg Whitman has demanded an apology. The Democratic campaign of California Attorney General Jerry Brown has responded. ""The use of the term 'whore' is an insult to both Meg Whitman and to the women of California,"" her campaign spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said. ""This is an appalling and unforgivable smear against Meg Whitman."" Brown's campaign manager Steven Glazer said: ""This was a jumbled and often inaudible recording of a private conversation. At times, our language was salty. We apologize to Ms. Whitman and anyone who may have been offended."" The conversation was recorded after Brown thought he'd disconnected a call to the Los Angeles police union. The union, the L.A. Police Protective League, turned over the recording to the Los Angeles Times. In it, the attorney general and his aides discussed resisting pressure to cut public-safety pensions or face losing police endorsements to Whitman. ""Do we want to put an ad out? ... That I have been warned if I crack down on pensions, I will be ... that they'll go to Whitman, and that's where they'll go, because they know Whitman will give 'em, will cut them a deal, but I won't,"" Brown said. Someone else said: ""What about saying she's a whore?"" ""Well, I'm going to use that,"" Brown replied. ""It proves you've cut a secret deal to protect the pensions."" The race between Brown and Whitman is a high-stakes one, in the United States' most populated and economically powerful state. According to campaign-finance records filed Tuesday, Whitman has spent $140.1 million, eclipsing the amount spent on previous gubernatorial elections in California. By comparison, all the candidates in the 2006 gubernatorial election spent a combined $40.5 million, while 135 candidates spent a combined $49.9 million in the 2003 gubernatorial recall election. In 2002, gubernatorial candidates spent a combined $107.1 million. The former eBay CEO has donated a total of $119 million to her campaign, more than any candidate has spent in personal funds in a single campaign. The previous record was set by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who contributed $108.4 million to his 2009 re-election bid. ""California is an expensive place to run a campaign, but this is still a staggering amount for one candidate to spend on one statewide election,"" CNN Political Research Director Robert Yoon said. ""This is a level of spending you usually only see from major presidential candidates and national party committees."" Brown has spent about $11 million on his campaign, but he didn't face any serious primary challenges and has enjoyed the support of spending by independent groups on his behalf. Groups partly funded by labor organizations have spent more than $10 million on television commercials attacking Whitman. Most recent polls of likely voters in California, including a CNN/Time/Opinion Research Corp. survey, indicate that Brown holds a single-digit advantage over Whitman. The winner of November's general election will succeed moderate Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's prevented by term limits from running for re-election.","An aide to the Democratic candidate uses the word on the Republican hopeful .

"The world's getting hotter, the sea's rising and there's increasing evidence neither are naturally occurring phenomena. So says a report from the U.N. International Panel on Climate Change, a document released every six years that is considered the benchmark on the topic. More than 800 authors and 50 editors from dozens of countries took part in its creation. The summary for policymakers was released early Friday, while the full report, which bills itself as ""a comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate change,"" will be distributed Monday. Other reports, including those dealing with vulnerability and mitigation, will be released next year. Here are the highlights from Friday's summary: . Man-made climate change is almost certain . Climate scientists are 95% confident -- that is to say, surer than ever -- that humans are responsible for at least ""half of the observed increase in global average surface temperatures since the 1950s."" This is the major headline from the report, as it marks a stark spike in confidence over the last 12 years, as scientists were 90% confident in 2007 and 66% confident in 2001 of the same conclusion. An increase in carbon dioxide concentrations that is ""unprecedented"" in the last 20,000 years, along with increases in other emissions, have driven up average temperatures by about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) since 1950, the report states. Worst-case predictions are that by 2100, temperatures could increase by as much as 3.7 degrees Celsius (6.6 Fahrenheit), the report says. Climate change is already affecting extreme weather . Since 1950 we've seen a dramatic increase in extreme weather. This is especially true of record heat and heavier precipitation events. While it's difficult to determine the exact role climate change plays in an individual event, such as Hurricane Sandy or the EF-5 tornado that struck Moore, Oklahoma, because there are so many ingredients necessary to brew a single storm, the links are clearer when you look at overall patterns. According to a study released this month in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, scientists found strong links between global warming and extreme weather around the globe in 2012. Among the 2012 events were the July heat wave in the northeastern and north-central United States, the spring heat wave in the eastern United States, the Great Plains drought, the winter drought in Spain and Portugal and the heavy rains and flooding in Europe. According to a paper in the journal Nature, this year, weather events that have previously been classified as ""storms of the century"" could become the storm of ""every 20 years or less."" ""Climate change will probably increase storm intensity and size simultaneously, resulting in a significant intensification of storm surges,"" the paper said. The last 30-year period is ""very likely"" the warmest in the last 800 years . Scientists are 90% sure that 1981-2010 was the warmest such span in the last eight centuries, and there's a 66% chance that it was the warmest 30-year period in the last 1,400 years. While the last 15 years have not warmed as quickly, we've seen steady warming over most of the globe, and we haven't seen a below-average temperature month since February 1985. Scientists are also 99% certain that we will see more hot days and nights -- and fewer chilly ones -- as the 21st century progresses. ""Each of the last three decades has been significantly warmer than all preceding decades since 1850,"" according to the IPCC report. To give you an idea of how the Earth has heated up, the combined land and ocean temperature increased by about 0.8 degrees Celsius between 1901 and 2010, yet between 1979 and 2010, the temperature spiked about 0.5 degrees Celsius. Sea level rise will increase due to warming oceans and loss of ice . Better climate models give scientists more confidence that sea level rise will accelerate in the 21st century. Scientists are 99% sure that sea level rise has accelerated over the last 2 centuries at a rate higher than at any time in the last 2,000 years. They're also highly confident that if the global surface temperature increases by more than 2 degrees Celsius over present temperatures we could see ""a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in late summer."" The report further notes that there is increasing evidence that ice sheets are losing mass, glaciers are shrinking, Arctic sea ice cover is diminishing, snow cover is decreasing and permafrost is thawing in the Northern Hemisphere. As for the rise in sea level, scientists asserted in the IPCC report that tide gauges and satellite data make it ""unequivocal"" that the world's mean sea level is on the upswing. Even if we end emission tomorrow, climate change could continue for centuries . This may be one of the more harrowing findings in the report, as it suggests we're too far gone to effect any meaningful change in our lifetimes. Even if we end carbon dioxide emissions today, effects could linger for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. And certain changes may already be irreversible. ""Many aspects of climate change will persist for centuries even if concentrations of greenhouse gases are stabilized. This represents a multicentury commitment created by human activities today,"" the report states.","Scientists surer than ever humans play major role in climate change, report says .
Global warming already affecting extreme weather, and it could get worse, report says .
U.N.'s IPCC convenes every six years to put together report; it's considered benchmark on topic .
Even if emissions ended today, effects of climate change could linger for centuries ."
"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Saudi Arabia slammed protesters in Egypt on Saturday as ""infiltrators"" who seek to destabilize their country, while a a top Palestinian official affirmed ""solidarity"" with Egypt. An official in Iran called on Egypt to ""abide by the rightful demands of the nation"" and avoid violent reactions. And in Israel, a member of the Knesset, or parliament, described a recent conversation with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that suggested that Mubarak had been expecting -- and preparing for -- the wave of unrest that has engulfed Egypt, the most populous Arab nation. Leaders across the Middle East were following events in Egypt with rapt attention Saturday, aided in that endeavor by saturation coverage on Arabic television networks such as Al-Jazeera. Many are on edge after protests in Algeria, Jordan and Yemen following unrest in Tunisia that forced that country's president from office after two decades in power. In Saudi Arabia, the turmoil in Egypt rattled investors as the nation's stock market lost over 6% of its value Saturday. That said, Saudi King Abdullah called Mubarak and ""was reassured"" about the situation in Egypt, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. ""During the call, the king said, 'Egypt is a country of Arabism and Islam. No Arab and Muslim human being can bear that some infiltrators, in the name of freedom of expression, have infiltrated into the brotherly people of Egypt, to destabilize its security and stability and they have been exploited to spew out their hatred in destruction, intimidation, burning, looting and inciting a malicious sedition,'"" the news agency said. Saudi Arabia ""strongly condemns"" the protest, it said. Mubarak assured the Saudi king ""that the situation is stable"" and that the protests ""are merely attempts of groups who do not want stability and security for the people of Egypt, but rather they seek to achieve strange and suspicious objectives."" Mubarak added that Egypt will ""deter anyone who tries to exploit the freedom of (the) Egyptian people and will not allow anyone to lure those groups or use them to achieve suspicious and strange agendas,"" the news agency said. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called Mubarak and ""affirmed his solidarity with Egypt and his commitment to its security and stability,"" according to the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa. In Iran, meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Egyptian authorities should respect the demonstrators. ""Iran expects Egyptian officials to listen to the voice of their Muslim people, respond to their rightful demands and refrain from exerting violence by security forces and police against an Islamic wave of awareness that has spread through the country in form of a popular movement,"" the state-run Press TV quoted Mehmanparast as saying. The reactions did not come as a surprise. Iran's Shiite government has long been at odds with mostly Sunni Saudi Arabia for dominance in the region. In Israel, where the Sabbath lasts through Saturday evening, there was no comment from top officials. But Benjamin Ben Eliezer, a Knesset member, told Israel's Channel 10 that he recently spoke with Mubarak, who told him that ""this is not Beirut and not Tunis"" and suggested that Egyptian authorities had prepared the army in advance. Ben Eliezer is known to be the Israeli politician with the best personal relationship with Mubarak. Some staff members at the Israel Embassy in Cairo plan to stay in Egypt, but some of their relatives and other Israeli citizens have flown back to Israel, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said. On the streets of Abu Dhabi, CNN spoke with people to gauge their views of the Egyptian demonstrations. ""It's great that everyone is coming together,"" said Ayat el-Dwary, an Egyptian. ""These are not just one group of people or one faction ... It's a revolution, absolutely."" ""Tunis opened the door,"" el-Dwary said, in a reference to protests in Tunisia that ultimately overthrew a government. ""But it was bound to happen -- it was inevitable. Change is coming to Egypt."" Samar Barakeh, who is Lebanese, said, ""It's time for them to change their government and they have the right to say whatever they want."" Fellow Lebanese Antoinet Ghanem said, ""It's about the whole regime structuring themselves to create more opportunities for these people to realize their ambitions and dreams ...  It's about the people trying to express what they need."" CNN's Christine Theodorou contributed to this report .","NEW: Saudi Arabia's stock market drops over 6% of its value .

"Mitt Romney hit his party's ""magic number"" on Tuesday, unofficially clinching the Republican presidential nomination in a race he entered as the front-runner and has had to himself for weeks. Romney led the pack when he announced his second run for the White House last June, and he has watched his rivals for the nomination slowly trickle out as their own wins looked increasingly unlikely. The delegates to put him over the 1,144 necessary for the GOP nomination came in Texas, the lone state to vote this week. Romney entered the day 78 delegates away from the magic number, and on Tuesday CNN projected he would win the state's GOP presidential primary, where 152 of the state's 155 delegates were at stake. On Tuesday, Romney said he was humbled to have secured the requisite delegates to become the GOP nominee. ""I am honored that Americans across the country have given their support to my candidacy and I am humbled to have won enough delegates to become the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee,"" Romney wrote. ""Our party has come together with the goal of putting the failures of the last 3½ years behind us. I have no illusions about the difficulties of the task before us. But whatever challenges lie ahead, we will settle for nothing less than getting America back on the path to full employment and prosperity. On November 6, I am confident that we will unite as a country and begin the hard work of fulfilling the American promise and restoring our country to greatness."" The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, congratulated Romney on the milestone, saying Romney would ""offer America the new direction we so desperately need."" Priebus' Democratic counterpart, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, was less enthusiastic. ""Tonight, after six years of trying and millions of dollars spent, and after a year of tepid support against one of the weakest fields in history, Mitt Romney has finally secured enough delegates to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee,"" wrote Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. ""Romney may have finally gained enough delegates to become the nominee, but what's been truly remarkable about his path to the nomination is how much damage he's left in his wake as he enters the general election."" Romney has been the presumptive nominee for weeks, but will not be the official party nominee until the Republican National Convention, set to be held the week of August 27 in Tampa, Florida. Romney launched his campaign on a warm day last June, telling his supporters gathered at a New Hampshire farm that ""Barack Obama has failed America."" Opinion: How political ads can elect a president . ""From my first day in office my No. 1 job will be to see that America once again is No.1 in job creation,"" he said. The early primary battleground state would play an important role in his campaign.  He initially invested more in New Hampshire than the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, which he eventually lost by a small margin to former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. New England voters have long been familiar with Romney, even before his 2008 presidential bid. He served as governor of Massachusetts between 2003 and 2007. Texas figured into this presidential race long before the first votes cast on Tuesday. One of the three factors in Santorum's April decision to end his presidential bid was a decision by Texas Republicans not to change their proportional delegate model to a winner-take-all system, which -- if he had stayed in the race and won the state -- could have given him a boost and held back Romney's delegate accumulation. Opinion: GOP's problem with Latinos - as big as Texas . Two of Romney's rivals in the once-crowded field are from Texas. Texas Gov. Rick Perry exited the race two days before the mid-January primary in South Carolina after a disappointing fifth-place finish in Iowa and his decision to stop campaigning in the second state to vote, New Hampshire. Earlier this month, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas said he would no longer actively campaign for the Republican nomination, effectively ending his third run for the Oval Office with 122 delegates. When Santorum, Paul and others were still in the race, talk of a contested convention swirled and it seemed to some a realistic possibility that Romney might not reach the magic number before the last state voted in June. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to push his bid onward to the convention unless Romney were to clinch the nomination earlier. He told reporters in late March that if Romney ""does not have a majority [of delegates], I think you'll then have one of the most interesting, open conventions in American history.""  He suspended his bid in early May, and on Tuesday was to appear with Romney at a fundraiser in Las Vegas. The earliest contests weeded out Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who won the Iowa straw poll last summer but finished sixth in its January caucuses, and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, who ended his bid before the South Carolina vote after falling short in New Hampshire. Others dropped out before the voting began. Businessman Herman Cain's once-unlikely rise ended in December amid allegations of sexual misbehavior.  Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty dropped out months earlier, in August, after the high stakes Ames, Iowa, straw poll. Romney, who becomes the first Mormon presidential nominee of a major party, previously sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2008. He dropped out after Super Tuesday, which allocated 1,020 delegates from 21 states. The Texas primary in early March of that year gave Sen. John McCain of Arizona the necessary delegates to seal up the GOP nomination. 'Other-ness': What Obama and Romney have in common on religion, race . In his 2008 convention speech, Romney spoke about many of the same themes that are prominent in his campaign this cycle, including a call ""to rein in government spending, lower taxes, take a weed wacker to excessive regulation and mandates ... pursue every source of energy security, from new efficiencies to renewables, from coal to non-CO2 producing nuclear and for the immediate drilling for more oil off our shores."" President Barack Obama faced no national competition for the Democratic presidential nomination, and CNN projected he accumulated the 2,778 necessary delegates on April 3.","With projected Texas win, Romney has necessary 1,144 delegates .
""I am humbled to have won enough delegates,"" Romney says .
He will not be the official party nominee until the Republican National Convention ."
"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- Hours after the sitting president was deposed by a military-led coup, a new president of Honduras was sworn in Sunday. Honduras President Jose Manuel Zelaya was detained and sent to Costa Rica, the government said. But the former president was not ready to give up his powers. The political developments that swept Honduras over the past weeks and led up to Sunday's coup had the makings of a crisis, but the situation in the Central American nation of 8 million people was calm. Roberto Micheletti was sworn in as provisional president to the applause of members of Congress, who chanted, ""Honduras! Honduras!"" Outside the building, supporters of ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya protested, but their numbers were limited, and the streets remained mostly peaceful. Micheletti told CNN en Español Sunday evening that he has imposed an ""indefinite"" curfew. Micheletti, the head of Congress, became president after lawmakers voted by a show of hands to strip Zelaya of his powers, with a resolution stating that Zelaya ""provoked confrontations and divisions"" within the country. A letter of resignation purported to be from Zelaya was read to members before the vote. But the deposed president, Zelaya, emphatically denied in an interview with CNN en Español that he wrote the letter. Speaking from Costa Rica, where he was taken after the coup, he said he plans to continue exercising his presidential duties with a trip to Managua, Nicaragua, to attend a summit of Central American heads-of-state. Zelaya awoke to the sound of gunfire in his residence and was still in his pajamas when the military forced him to leave the country Sunday morning, he told reporters. He was flown to Costa Rica, where he has not requested political asylum. ""This was a brutal kidnapping of me with no justification,"" Zelaya said. He called the coup an attack on Honduran democracy. ""There are ways to protest without arms,"" Zelaya said. The coup came on the same day that he had vowed to follow through with a nonbinding referendum that the Honduran Supreme Court had ruled illegal.  Watch details on ""curious situation"" in Honduras » . The coup was widely criticized in the region, in strongest terms by Zelaya's leftist allies, including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. A statement from Venezuela's foreign ministry said Zelaya was ""violently expelled from his country by a group of unpatriotic, coup-mongering soldiers."" The Bolivian government also condemned the coup, accusing Honduran troops of kidnapping Zelaya and violently expelling him from his country. Elsewhere, Jose Miguel Insulza, the secretary-general of the Organization of American States, strongly condemned the coup in a statement. And in Washington, President Obama said in a statement that he was ""deeply concerned"" by the news. ""I call on all political and social actors in Honduras to respect democratic norms, the rule of law and the tenets of the Inter-American Democratic Charter,"" Obama said. ""Any existing tensions and disputes must be resolved peacefully through dialogue free from any outside interference."" The president of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, called the Honduran military's intervention a ""criminal action."" But in Honduras, the Supreme Court said in an official statement that the military was acting in accordance with a court order to put an end to Sunday's scheduled vote, which the court's justices had found illegal. Micheletti addressed the issue directly in his first remarks as provisional president. ""I did not reach this position because of a coup,"" Micheletti said. ""I am here because of an absolutely legal transition process."" No other countries immediately recognized Micheletti as president. Zelaya, a leftist elected in 2005, had found himself pitted against the other branches of government and military leaders over the issue of Sunday's planned referendum. It would have asked voters to place a measure on November's ballot allowing the formation of a constitutional assembly that could modify the nation's charter to allow the president to run for another term. In various interviews Sunday, Zelaya characterized the vote not as a referendum, but as a survey to gauge receptiveness toward a constitutional assembly. He denied that he would have been the beneficiary of any future constitutional changes. Zelaya, whose four-year term ends in January 2010, cannot run for re-election under current law. The Honduran Supreme Court had ruled the poll illegal, and Congress and the top military brass agreed, but Zelaya had remained steadfast. In the end, it appeared the opposition to Zelaya was too great. The military confiscated the ballots from the presidential residence, in effect canceling the disputed vote. In separate appearances Sunday, Zelaya, Venezuela's Chavez and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said that the military had also detained Honduran Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas, further raising regional tensions. Speaking in Havana, Rodriguez said that the Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan ambassadors to Honduras had tried but were unable to protect Rodas from a group of masked soldiers who forcibly took her from their grasp. Further details regarding that incident were unclear. ""If they attack our ambassadors, they will be declaring a state of war,"" Chavez said. ""If they have weapons, then we have weapons, too.""","Honduran Congress strips president of powers, names provisional president .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The last gunmen in a standoff at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai were killed early Saturday, the city's police chief told CNN sister station CNN-IBN, but another official said more attackers could be inside the hotel. ""It's completely over, except for the fact that now we will start searching the hotel and sanitizing it against any explosives and against any other things that may have been left behind,"" police Chief Hussain Gafoor said. The announcement coincided with the end of intermittent gunfire from the historic Taj, which has been the scene of a violent and drawn-out standoff resulting in numerous deaths and injuries since Wednesday. It also signaled a potential end to two nights and three days of terror attacks targeting several high-traffic landmarks in Mumbai known to be frequented by tourists. The casualty toll from the attacks reached 160 dead and 327 wounded Friday, officials said. However, J.K. Dutt, director-general of the national security guard, said there could be more terrorists and that the operation was still ongoing. Dutt also differed from Gafoor on the number of gunmen involved, saying three, not two, had been killed. He appealed to guests hiding in their rooms to open their curtains to signal their presence to security officials, saying it would help police snipers determine whether someone in a room was actually a terrorist with a weapon. The announcements came shortly after a fire swept through the ground floor, enveloping much of the historic building. By 8:30 a.m. local time, the fire was under control, CNN-IBN reported. Dutt said the fire had been set by the attackers as a diversionary tactic . CNN-IBN also reported that someone had jumped from the hotel during the fire and appeared to be dead. It broadcast a picture of the body taken with a cell phone. On Friday, scores of hostages trickled out of the Taj and the nearby Oberoi hotel; some had spent as many as 48 hours huddled with strangers in guest rooms, closets or darkened banquet halls. It is still unclear who is behind the attacks, but the gunmen were men in their 20s who ""obviously had to be trained somewhere,"" a member of the Indian navy's commando unit said Friday.  Watch the commando talk about the attackers » . They fired at guests ""with no remorse"" and knew the layout of the hotels well enough to ""vanish"" after confronting security forces, the commando said. British Parliament member Sajjad Karim was in a herd of people running from gunfire in the lobby of the Taj when another gunman appeared before them and opened fire. ""From the very brief glimpse that I got of him, he was fairly young man of south Asian appearance, and he was wearing a smile on his face as he started to spray the bullets,"" Karim told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.  Watch Karim describe the gunman » . Karim said he spent eight hours barricaded in a room at the Taj with 40 to 50 people before commandos rescued him. But many did not make it out alive. The 160 who died included Westerners and Asians of all walks of life, including Indian police and military, five Americans and a British yacht magnate.  Watch survivor say gunmen were targeting Brits and Americans » . Maharashtra state official Bhushan Gagrani said the death toll is expected to rise further. Eleven terrorists have also been killed. Earlier, police said they found 36 bodies during a sweep of the Oberoi hotel; they killed two militants and freed hundreds of trapped guests. Americans Alan Scherr, 58, and his daughter Naomi, 13, of Virginia died at the Oberoi. They were visiting India with a meditation group. Read more about those killed in the terror attacks . The bodies of five hostages were found at the Chabad House Jewish center, which houses the Mumbai headquarters of the Chabad community, a Hasidic Jewish movement. Commandos stormed the building through a hole blasted in the wall.  Watch another day of terror in Mumbai » . After several hours of gunfire and explosions from inside, all went quiet, and CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson said it appeared that the operation was over. Mumbai Police Commissioner Hasan Gafoor told CNN-IBN that the gunman at the Taj was shooting and throwing grenades at security forces. Gafoor said most of the attackers had been heavily armed. ""They were carrying an AK assault rifle, one or two handguns and grenades."" Throughout the day, there were explosions, some blowing out windows at the 105-year-old landmark.

Police said they came by boats to the waterfront near the Gateway of India monument and the two hotels. Indian naval and coast guard investigators have determined that two vessels recently seized in the Arabian Sea have no links to the Mumbai attacks. A fishing trawler, however, remains in custody. The Press Trust of India, citing Union Cabinet Minister Kapil Sibal, reported that the gunmen had worked for months to prepare, even setting up ""control rooms"" in the two luxury hotels that were targeted. Indian authorities said no one had claimed responsibility, although the Deccan Mujahideen took credit in e-mails sent to several Indian news outlets. Interpol said it would send a delegation to India, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation wants to send a team, but India has not officially asked for its help.

""Until the investigation is complete, it will be difficult to say where they came from and how they came,"" he said. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also indicated that the gunmen came from Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, in a call with his Pakistani counterpart Friday. In response, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said he would send a representative from his country's intelligence agency to help with the investigation.

"(CNN) -- A system that was pushing ferocious storm cells in a track from Mississippi to the mid-Atlantic states brought reports of tornado sightings and delays at several large airports on Wednesday. Tornadoes had been reported Wednesday in North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, the National Weather Service said, though it had not yet confirmed the sightings. Tornado watches were in effect Wednesday afternoon in arc extending from Mississippi to New Jersey. A pair of apparent tornadoes had been spotted in eastern Virginia's Hanover County on Wednesday night, dispatch supervisor Nancy Langley told CNN. Local authorities have not received reports of injuries or calls for rescue, but fire crews and EMS workers are combing the area for victims, she said. In northern North Carolina's Orange County, an eyewitness saw a tornado damage a church and reported downed trees and power lines, the National Weather Service said. In Henrico County in southeastern Virginia, a dispatcher said that trees and power lines were felled Wednesday and that there was a widespread power outage. Flights heading into Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport were delayed an average of more than three hours, the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday evening. Planes into New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport were delayed an average of two hours and 39 minutes, according to the FAA. Similar and shorter delays also were reported at Chicago O'Hare International Airport; Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, New York's LaGuardia Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, and Newark International Airport. The system, which spawned at least 26 possible tornadoes Tuesday, brought snow and high winds across the Midwest. Wind advisories were posted across the Upper Midwest and sections of the Ohio Valley. Winter storm warnings -- with the promise of snow -- were in effect in North Dakota and Minnesota. CNN iReporter Gretchen Pearl in Duluth, Minnesota, said the area was experiencing high winds, heavy snow and slick roads. ""It's a very strong storm system that moved in,"" Pearl said. ""It's definitely been causing a major disruption."" Wednesday was a day of cleanup for many communities in North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Indiana, Wisconsin and Illinois. In addition to the tornadoes, some places recorded wind gusts exceeding 70 mph. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said there were 268 reports of wind damage Tuesday. High winds canceled hundreds of flights Tuesday -- more than 500 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport alone --  along with dozens more in Minnesota. The Minneapolis-St. Paul airport reduced air traffic from three runways to one for landings and takeoffs Tuesday because of high winds. Extensive damage from the high winds, tornadoes and possible tornadoes was reported from New York and Wisconsin to the Gulf Coast, but it was most heavily concentrated in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Six tornadoes were confirmed in Indiana, three in Ohio and one each in Virginia, Wisconsin and Kentucky. In Lincoln County, North Carolina, five homes were damaged and three destroyed by a possible tornado, spokesman Dion Burleson said late Tuesday. Eleven people were hurt -- one with life-threatening injuries. Storms brought down trees, which took power lines with them, knocking out electricity for hundreds of residents. Several cars were overturned in North Carolina's Catawba County, according to the National Weather Service.  Catawba emergency dispatch reported minor injuries, along with home damage. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, a possible tornado struck a fence near Chickamauga Dam and threw debris into a roadway, police said. Five people suffered injuries. Ten to 15 homes were damaged near the town of Geraldine in DeKalb County, Alabama, said Lauree Ashcom, spokeswoman for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. A tornado smashed into a business in LaPorte County, Indiana. Dan Hill, general manager of Hoosier Machinery Solutions, heard a weather siren and went to check. He turned to another employee after spying an odd cloud formation outside the business door. ""'Does that look like a tornado?' I asked. As soon as I said that, it touched down."" The twister tore a roof off a pole barn, damaged some reconditioned recycling equipment and employees' cars. No one was hurt. The 10 employees ""all ran for [heavy] equipment and got inside,"" Hill said. .

"A Massachusetts man was arrested Friday on suspicion of obstructing the investigation of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, authorities said. Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, of Quincy is charged with ""one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation,"" the U.S. attorney's office for Massachusetts said Friday. An indictment against Matanov was unsealed Friday. Authorities say brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev planted bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during a subsequent manhunt that paralyzed Boston. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to killing four people -- including three killed by the bombings -- and wounding more than 200 others. Matanov is not charged with participating in the bombings, but with trying to hide his connection to the Tsarnaev brothers. Outside court Friday, Matanov's lawyer, Ed Haden, said the indictment was based on ""unsubstantiated allegations."" ""He had no intent to mislead the investigation,"" Haden said. According to prosecutors, Matanov knew that investigators would want to talk to him after the bombings, and he allegedly tried to keep the FBI from learning the extent of his friendship and communication with the suspects. Prosecutors said that Manatov did not know about the bombings beforehand, but about 40 minutes after the blasts, invited and bought dinner for the brothers, according to the indictment. According to the indictment, once photos of the suspects were released, Matanov viewed them several times on CNN and on the FBI's website before trying to reach Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. In the hours and days following the bombings, Matanov contacted and attempted to contact the suspects by phone and saw Tamerlan Tsarnaev at least twice, according to the indictment. Matanov allegedly tried to give away his cell phone to friends and deleted hundreds of videos and documents from his computer and misled police about the extent of to which he knew the brothers. He also hid that he shared the ""philosophical justification for violence"" that the Tsarnaev brothers held, the U.S. attorney's office said. ""In addition to deleting information from his computer, Matanov made a number of false statements to federal investigators,"" the office's statement said. If convicted, Matanov faces up to 20 years in prison for the destruction of evidence charge, and eight years for each of the false statement counts. In separate cases, two friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's -- Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov -- pleaded not guilty in September to a superseding federal indictment charging them with conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstructing justice with intent to impede authorities. A third friend, Robel Phillipos, pleaded not guilty to making false statements to FBI agents during the bombings investigation. Phillipos was free on $100,000 bond and was being monitored electronically; Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, Kazakh nationals, were being held without bail. Authorities accused the trio of helping Tsarnaev after the deadly April 15, 2013, bombing by taking items from his dorm room and keeping them from authorities. Attorneys for the men denied the allegations. Timeline: The bombing, manhunt and the investigation .

"It may seem an academic argument when you're wiping sulphate-saturated tears from your eyes or coughing up a lung while sightseeing at the Forbidden City or the Red Fort, but a new study says New Delhi has outstripped Beijing and gained the inglorious title of the world's most polluted major city. At its worst, air pollution in New Delhi this winter was 60 times higher than the level considered safe, the research from India's Center for Science and Environment (CSE) reveals. The most harmful airborne pollutants, categorized innocuously enough as PM2.5, averaged 575 micrograms per cubic meter in the Indian capital from November to January. That compared with a -- still dangerous -- concentration of 400 micrograms at peak levels in Beijing over the same period. Airborne danger . PM2.5 refers to the diameter in microns of nasties such as ammonia, carbon, nitrates and sulfate -- particulates small enough to pass into the bloodstream and cause diseases such as emphysema and cancer. A city such as London has an average PM2.5 level of 20 micrograms, which is considered safe. Beijing looks as though it could permanently lose lose its mantle as the world's smoggiest big city if it keeps up the good work the CSE report describes. The Chinese capital has made ""consistent and aggressive efforts"" to improve air quality, the CSE says, including limiting annual car sales, banning odd or even number-plated vehicles during ""red alert"" pollution periods and fining local governments for failing to curb smog. New Delhi, by contrast, is marked by ""weak ... stringency ... and enforcement"" of pollution controls. Killer cities . ""Originally designed as compact entities to reduce the length of travel ... [Indian cities] are becoming victims of killer pollution, congestion ... and a crippling car-dependent infrastructure,"" the CSE says. It's a quote New Delhi worthies must hope doesn't make it into the next Lonely Planet. It is, however, a decent snapshot of the aghast impression your average neophyte India traveler receives after stepping out of Indira Gandhi International Airport when she thought she'd come to the land of peace, love and really full-on yoga. The number of cars on New Delhi streets grows by 1,400 a day, with Indian manufacturers obliged to fit only basic emission-cutting apparatus to their vehicles. Smoke from the burning of rubbish, industrial emissions and pollutants from the country's predominantly coal-fired power stations add to the dangerous and noisome atmosphere, the Times reports. Delhi's report card . New Delhi buses and some taxis might be running on natural gas, and 15-year-old commercial vehicles have been taken off the road (although that must in some cases include India's ubiquitous, hallucinogenically decorated trucks -- a bitter-sweet result) but such measures aren't enough to stop many of the city's inhabitants -- and the odd tourist -- from becoming seriously ill, the CSE report says. Medical studies point to the toxic risk of smog in the wide prevalence of acute lung diseases, eye disorders and Vitamin D deficiency leading to rickets among new Delhi inhabitants. Of particular concern to tourists, a University of California, Berkeley, study cited in the CSE report showed that pollution levels inside vehicles traveling in the Indian capital could be eight times worse than outside. As if riding in a New Delhi rickshaw wasn't stressful enough. And, just to divine the origin of that metallic taste you can't rid from your mouth when sightseeing in Delhi, the CSE study notes that ""exposure to vehicular fume in [the Indian capital] is among the highest in the world."" Would you still go? Forewarned is forearmed. It's up to the individual traveler whether Delhi's world-beating air pollution is enough reason not to see world-beating sights such as the Red Fort or chaotically creative -- and quintessentially Indian -- Chandni Chowk street market. On the other hand, it seems, you now have more reasons not to be afraid of trying Beijing roast duck on location or venturing into the Forbidden City. The 'dirty 10' And the dirtiest cities of all in the world, not just the big metropolises? New Delhi -- and Beijing -- were missing from such a list published in 2013 by the online business publication Quartz. With almost one-third more toxic airborne particulates than the next most polluted city, Ahwaz, pop. 3 million -- capital of Iran's main oil producing province -- was the dirtiest city on the planet. Other smog-bound centers in the ranking of 10 were Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Ludhiana, India; Peshawar, Pakistan and Gaborone, Botswana. Intrepid travelers: watch out.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Conservative columnist and former CNN ""Crossfire"" co-host Robert Novak has died after a yearlong battle with cancer, his family said Tuesday. He was 78. Robert Novak was a syndicated columnist who was a regular on CNN for 25 years. Novak died at home, over a year after doctors diagnosed him with a malignant brain tumor in August 2008. He was dubbed ""The Prince of Darkness"" by friends for his pessimistic persona, and he used the nickname as the title of his 2007 memoir. However, Sam Feist, CNN's political director, said the dour visage masked a ""warm-hearted guy"" who ""cared a lot about the people who worked for him.""  Watch how Novak will be remembered » . ""If you were a friend of Bob Novak's, you couldn't have a better friend,"" Feist said. Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide, said the network was saddened by the death of ""a journalist of the old school, hard-working, practical and passionate about our profession."" ""From its earliest days and for some 25 years, Bob shared generously with CNN and with CNN viewers his authority, credibility, humor and towering presence,"" Walton said in a statement. ""We're grateful to have worked alongside him and send our respect and sympathy to his family."" Novak was a veteran columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and a regular commentator for CNN for 25 years, beginning when the network launched in 1980. For most of that time, he was a co-host of the political debate program ""Crossfire."" But he also hosted a show with his longtime column co-author, Rowland Evans, and appeared as a panelist on shows like ""The Capital Gang"" and on PBS' ""The McLaughlin Group."" Novak got his first newspaper job in 1948, when he was still in high school. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Novak had ""the kind of keen insight that can only be gained through years and years of dedication to a craft."" ""He was a Washington institution who could turn an idea into the most discussed story around kitchen tables, congressional offices, the White House and everywhere in between,"" McConnell said in a written statement. Novak served in the Army during the Korean War before turning to the news business, eventually starting his column with Evans at the now-defunct New York Herald-Tribune in 1963. In 2003, he found himself at the center of the scandal over the exposure of CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson, when he published a column revealing her CIA status days after her husband challenged a key Bush administration justification for the invasion of Iraq. While staunchly conservative, Novak opposed the invasion and was frequently critical of the Bush administration. He cooperated with prosecutors and was not charged in the leak case. The scandal ultimately led to the conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators probing the leak. Novak later testified that the leak began with then-Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and was confirmed by Karl Rove, who was then President George W. Bush's top political adviser. Both men cooperated with the investigation, and neither was charged. iReport.com: Share memories of Novak . Novak was born to a Jewish family in Joliet, Illinois, on the outskirts of Chicago, but later became a devout Roman Catholic. He took up skydiving in his early 70s and was a passionate sports fan. He also once appeared as an extra in a Washington opera production. In an editorial published with news of Novak's death, the Sun-Times said Novak's columns ""were marked by his determination to dig out new information."" ""He combined that with sharp analysis, insightful commentary and passion about the issues facing the nation to emerge as a brawling contestant in the great national debates of his era,"" the newspaper said. Veteran Democratic consultant and on-air sparring partner James Carville said Novak ""had the best sources in the Republican Party,"" making his weekly column a must-read for political insiders. ""What you saw on television was an ideological guy, a fire-breathing right-wing guy,"" Carville said. But Novak ""still had the sort of ethos of the reporter."" Novak left the network in 2005 after an on-air blowup with Carville, who had been needling him over the CIA leak case. CNN suspended Novak, who apologized for using the word ""bullsh*t"" on air, and he resigned at the end of the year. ""I want to thank CNN for making this network available to me for 25 years,"" he said at the time. ""Never censored me once, ever, and I said some outrageous things. And it was a wonderful opportunity for me.""","NEW: CNN chief calls him ""old school, hard-working, practical and passionate""

"A judge in Pretoria ruled Wednesday that South African prosecutors can appeal Oscar Pistorius' conviction, but denied the state's bid to challenge his sentence. The decision means that the decision over Pistorius' fate isn't over, with the legal battle possibly extending well into next year. Prosecutors had said Pistorius' sentence of five years in prison for fatally shooting his girlfriend was nowhere near enough punishment. They also want the double-amputee track star to be convicted of a more serious charge. They had originally sought conviction on a charge of murder. Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, in the death of Reeva Steenkamp. The athlete didn't attend the hearing, which began Tuesday, but his father, Henke, was present. ""I don't think we should have gone this far,"" he told reporters as he left the courtroom. 'This is what we wanted' But prosecutors welcomed the decision. ""This is what we wanted,"" said Nathi Mncube, a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority. ""The issues that we wanted clarified are issues of law and of course the judge agreed with our arguments."" The victim's mother, June Steenkamp, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that she hopes the prospective appeal will be ""a good thing."" ""I just hope some truth comes out along the way,"" she said. "" ... They seem to forget that somebody actually died, actually, until my niece spoke about her to the judge. And that's the truth.  (Reeva Steenkamp) became invisible."" 'Shockingly light' In appeal documents filed previously, the prosecution called Pistorius' sentence ""shockingly light"" and inappropriate. Prosecutors argued that Judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted a complex South African standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. As a result, prosecutors argued, Pistorius should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge. In explaining her sentence at the trial, Masipa had said that Pistorius did not intend to kill Steenkamp. But critics of the verdict have argued that Masipa didn't correctly apply the intent standard, which is broader in South African law than what it typically means in casual conversation, Phelps said. Appeal could take a year or more . The case now goes to the Supreme Court of Appeals in Bloemfontein, which will hear the appeal itself. If that court finds Pistorius guilty of murder, the resulting sentence would be more severe. The minimum sentence for murder in South Africa is 15 years in prison. It usually takes at least a year for an appeal to be heard, according to Mncube of the National Prosecuting Authority. Pistorius, 28, made history when he became the first double amputee to compete in the able-bodied Olympics in 2012. He was born without the fibulae in his legs, which were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. Asked what she'd think if Pistorius returned to competition, Reeva Steenkamp's mother told CNN, ""To be honest with you, I don't care what he does."" ""I've got no interest in him whatsoever,"" June Steenkamp said. ""Nothing is going to change my life unless my daughter ... could come back by some magic.""","Reeva Steenkamp's mother hopes the appeal will be a ""good thing""

"In his zeal to promote nuclear power, filmmaker Robert Stone inserted numerous half-truths and less-than-half-truths in his new documentary ""Pandora's Promise,"" which CNN is airing on November 7. One of Stone's more misleading allegations was that scientists at a U.S. research facility, the Argonne National Laboratory, were on the verge of developing a breakthrough technology that could solve nuclear power's numerous problems when the Clinton administration and its allies in Congress shut the program in 1994 for purely political reasons. Like the story of Pandora itself, the tale of the integral fast reactor (IFR) -- or at least the version presented in the movie -- is more myth than reality. In the final assessment, the concept's drawbacks greatly outweighed its advantages. The government had sound reasons to stanch the flow of taxpayer dollars to a costly, flawed project that also was undermining U.S. efforts to reduce the risks of nuclear terrorism and proliferation around the world. Read what Robert Stone has to say . In the film, scientists who worked on the IFR program unsurprisingly sing its praises. For example, Charles Till, a former program manager, claimed that the reactor ""can't melt down"" and would therefore be immune to the type of catastrophes that occurred at Three Mile Island in 1979 and Fukushima in 2011. Others told Stone that the reactor, by ""recycling"" its own used, or ""spent,"" fuel, would conserve uranium resources and produce much less nuclear waste than conventional reactors. But the reactor's advocates didn't tell the whole story, and Stone did not include anyone in the film who could have provided a more balanced and realistic assessment. What did ""Pandora's Promise"" leave out? First, it does not clearly explain what a ""fast reactor"" is and how it differs from the water-cooled reactors in use today. Most operating reactors use a type of fuel called ""low-enriched"" uranium, which cannot be used directly to make a nuclear weapon and poses a low security risk. The spent fuel from these water-cooled reactors contains weapon-usable plutonium as a byproduct, but it is very hard to make into a bomb because it is mixed with uranium and highly radioactive fission products. Fast reactors, on the other hand, are far more dangerous because they typically require fuels made from plutonium or ""highly enriched"" uranium that can be used to make nuclear weapons. In fact, fast reactors can be operated as ""breeders"" that produce more plutonium than they consume. To produce the large quantities of plutonium needed to fuel fast reactors, spent fuel from conventional reactors has to be reprocessed -- chemically processed to separate plutonium from the other constituents. Facilities that produce plutonium fuel must have strong protections against diversion and theft. All too often, however, security at such facilities is inadequate. In the IFR concept, which was never actually realized in practice, reactor-spent fuel would be reprocessed using a technology called pyroprocessing, and the extracted plutonium would be fabricated into new fuel. IFR advocates have long asserted that pyroprocessing is not a proliferation risk because the plutonium it separates is not completely purified. But a 2008 U.S. Department of Energy review -- which confirmed many previous studies -- concluded that pyroprocessing and similar technologies would ""greatly reduce barriers to theft, misuse or further processing, even without separation of pure plutonium."" See the Department of Energy review here (PDF) Other Department of Energy studies showed that pyroprocessing, by generating large quantities of low-level nuclear waste and contaminated uranium, greatly increases the volume of nuclear waste requiring disposal, contradicting ""Pandora's Promise's"" claim it would reduce the amount of waste. See Union of Concerned Scientists fact sheet (PDF) And what about Till's claim that the IFR can't melt down? It's false. ""Pandora's Promise"" referenced two successful safety tests conducted in 1986 at a small demonstration fast reactor in Idaho called the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). But EBR-II operators scripted these tests to ensure the desired outcome, a luxury not available in the real world. Meanwhile, the EBR-II's predecessor, the EBR-I, had a partial fuel meltdown in 1955, and a similar reactor, Fermi 1 near Detroit, had a partial fuel meltdown in 1966. See U.S. Department of Energy information posted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (PDF) Moreover, fast reactors have inherent instabilities that make them far more dangerous than light-water reactors under certain accident conditions, conditions that were studiously avoided in the 1986 dog-and-pony show at EBR-II. Perhaps the biggest myth in the film is the notion that all U.S. research on fast reactors was terminated. In fact, the IFR program's demise was a shutdown in name only. The Department of Energy has continued to fund research and development on fast reactor technology to the tune of tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The IFR Fuel Reprocessing Facility in Idaho shown in the film -- in reality, a plant called the Fuel Conditioning Facility -- has been operating for decades, essentially as a jobs program, to reprocess spent fuel from the now-defunct EBR-II, despite the system's serious problems. In 2000, the Department of Energy promised that all the fuel would be processed by around 2007.  Three years later, it delayed the projected completion date to 2030. Till's assertion in ""Pandora's Promise"" that ""we know how to do these things"" does not square with the difficulties the Department of Energy has encountered in trying to operate this troubled plant. But if CNN viewers are persuaded by the ""Pandora's Promise"" IFR sales pitch and think the federal government should throw even more good taxpayer money after bad, I have two words of advice: Caveat emptor.","Scientist: ""Pandora's Promise"" offers ""half-truths"" promoting integral fast reactors .
Government: IFRs cut ""barriers to theft, misuse"" of plutonium, which is used for weapons .
Film falsely says IFRs can't melt down, says Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists ."
"Would he ever fly again, now that his feet and right hand were gone? That was among the first things amateur pilot Brian Thomas wondered after he awoke from surgery in 2009. A blood disease similar to hemophilia forced doctors to make him a triple amputee, removing his right hand and the ends of his feet. A blog post by amateur pilot and journalist Miles O'Brien revealed this week that the former CNN anchor was also the victim of a medical condition that required amputation. O'Brien lost his left arm, sending concern throughout the online news and aviation communities. O'Brien, a correspondent for PBS ""NewsHour,"" appeared on CNN for 17 years, mostly focusing on science, technology and aerospace coverage. Thomas, 30, has an idea of what O'Brien might be going through after his amputation. ""It'll take some time for him to adapt, but he'll be back in it in no time,"" Thomas said Wednesday from his workplace in Lincoln, Nebraska. Former CNN anchor's arm amputated after accident . Thomas had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The Mayo Clinic describes it as a ""disorder that can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding"" resulting ""from unusually low levels of platelets — the cells that help your blood clot."" He had been flying his father's tiny Cessna single-engine plane for about a decade when one day he fell into a coma and was rushed to a hospital. When he awoke, doctors told Thomas he would probably face amputations. Thus began a battle against the disorder and against depression, which he won thanks to encouragement from his family. Thomas then started his journey back to the cockpit. First, Thomas had to get a health evaluation. The FAA requires all pilots to be medically fit before they can be certified to fly solo. ""They see if  you're able to meet the regulations performance-wise, even though you have a physical deficiency,"" Thomas said. He sent his medical records to be reviewed by an aviation medical examiner, who recommended that the FAA allow him to take a medical flight evaluation test. Only 18 months after his amputations and rehabilitation, Thomas was finally sitting in the pilot's seat of a tiny rented airplane with an instructor, ready to show what he could still accomplish. ""I was a little nervous, because I was having trouble getting the airplane started,"" Thomas laughed. ""It was giving me fits."" Eventually, the engine revved to life, and they were airborne. The instructor was mostly interested in judging Thomas' access to the plane's instruments and how well he could control the plane. Thomas practiced several takeoffs and landings and checked his braking. After the test, the instructor handed Thomas his paperwork. ""And I was a pilot again!""  he recalled. ""It was just a huge sigh of relief, because I wasn't sure what to expect."" He celebrated by, what else, taking a solo flight. The same day he passed his test, Thomas was soaring high above Nebraska after dark. ""It was crystal clear,"" he said. ""You could see a golden trail of headlights down the interstate."" ""I can't believe I got here,"" he thought. ""It made me feel so successful, like, 'Well what's my next challenge?' "" Thankfully, Thomas' remaining hand -- his left -- was the one he most relied on to fly before the surgery. He has always used his left hand to control his steering wheel, aka ""the stick."" Thomas uses his prosthetic arm and hook, which now substitute for his right hand, to control the plane's engine, or throttle. ""The hook doesn't do a whole lot. It just pushes and pulls on the throttle,"" Thomas said. ""The left hand is where the magic is. That's where you need all the fine motor skills, is running the stick."" Thomas said that for a pilot missing the ""magic hand"" -- the main steering hand -- ""it would be considerably more challenging to get back into it. But it wouldn't be insurmountable. It just takes more practice, I would say."" As for the aircraft's pedals, which control the rudder, Thomas said he doesn't use any special gear. ""It's harder for me than it used to be to feel where the rudder pedals are, because I don't have any toes. The whole front half of my feet are gone."" If it's really windy and gusty, ""it makes it more of a big deal,"" he said. ""The taxiing, takeoff and landing portion, that's really the most critical time to have your game on.""

He often used his plane to travel to story assignments and as a platform to explain aviation stories to a wider audience. The aviation community is tight-knit, and Thomas is reaching out to O'Brien as he would for any fellow pilot. ""I'd be more than happy to help him any way I can,"" he said. The horizon looks bright for Thomas, who's been an aviation mechanic in Lincoln for about eight years and now flies about once a week. He has co-written a book about his experience, ""Modified Flight Plan."" And soon he wants to fly across America to inspire other amputees. ""I'm still trying to figure out where to go,"" he said.

"Authorities in Northern Virginia on Thursday busted an alleged violent gang and arrested the accused ringleader and four others on charges of forcing high school girls to be prostitutes. The defendants, most of whom were arrested overnight, were scheduled to appear in federal court Friday afternoon in Alexandria, Virginia, on charges that include underage sex trafficking. The alleged ringleader is identified in court documents as Justin Strom, 26, of Lorton, Virginia, a suburb of Washington. He is described as the Fairfax County, Virginia, leader of the Underground Gangster Crips. The arrests of the five alleged members of the gang follow six other arrests of members of the gang in the past year and a half, officials said. The investigation began in September 2011, but an affidavit lists alleged crimes by the reputed gang members dating back to 2006. Officials from the U.S. attorney's office, the Virginia attorney general's office and others say Strom and his associates recruited high school girls to work for them as prostitutes and vowed violence if they tried to leave. Authorities identified at least 10 high school girls between 16 and 18 years of age who were recruited. The amounts of money involved were generally small, with prostitutes often receiving $50 for performing sexual acts. Authorities arrested Michael Jefferies, 21, of Woodbridge on Wednesday night. He allegedly handled the money. They arrested Strom and Henock Ghile, 23, of Springfield early Thursday. Ghile allegedly transported the girls. Donyel Dove, an alleged bodyguard and driver, was arrested on March 24 in Warren County on separate charges. The fifth man, Christopher Sylvia, 22, of Springfield, Virginia, was arrested on March 8 as a driver in the sex trafficking conspiracy.","Alleged gang members set to appear in federal court Friday in Alexandria, Virginia .

"Washington (CNN) -- A program that allows airports to replace government screeners with private screeners is being brought to a standstill, just a month after the Transportation Security Administration said it was ""neutral"" on the program. TSA chief John Pistole said Friday he has decided not to expand the program beyond the current 16 airports, saying he does not see any advantage to it. Though little known, the Screening Partnership Program allowed airports to replace government screeners with private contractors who wear TSA-like uniforms, meet TSA standards and work under TSA oversight. Among the airports that have ""opted out"" of government screening are San Francisco and Kansas City. The push to ""opt out"" gained attention in December amid the fury over the TSA's enhanced pat downs, which some travelers called intrusive. Rep. John Mica, a Republican from Florida, wrote a letter encouraging airports to privatize their airport screeners, saying they would be more responsive to the public. At that time, the TSA said it neither endorsed nor opposed private screening. ""If airports chose this route, we are going to work with them to do it,"" a TSA spokesman said in late December. But on Friday, the TSA denied an application by Springfield-Branson Airport in Missouri to privatize its checkpoint workforce, and in a statement, Pistole indicated other applications likewise will be denied. ""I examined the contractor screening program and decided not to expand the program beyond the current 16 airports as I do not see any clear or substantial advantage to do so at this time,"" Pistole said. He said airports that currently use contractor screening will continue to be allowed to. Pistole said he has been reviewing TSA policies with the goal of helping the agency ""evolve into a more agile, high-performance organization."" Told of the change Friday night, Mica said he intends to launch an investigation and review the matter. ""It's unimaginable that TSA would suspend the most successfully performing passenger screening program we've had over the last decade,"" Mica said Friday night. ""The agency should concentrate on cutting some of the more than 3,700 administrative personnel in Washington who concocted this decision, and reduce the army of TSA employees that has ballooned to more than 62,000."" ""Nearly every positive security innovation since the beginning of TSA has come from the contractor screening program,"" Mica said. A union for Transportation Security Administration employees said it supported the decision to halt the program. ""The nation is secure in the sense that the safety of our skies will not be left in the hands of the lowest-bidder contractor, as it was before 9/11,"" said John Gage, president of the American Federation of Government Employees. ""We applaud Administrator Pistole for recognizing the value in a cohesive federalized screening system and work force."" Advocates of private screeners say it is easier to discipline and replace under-performing private screeners than government ones. But Congress members have differed over the effectiveness of private screeners. Mica said tests show that private screeners perform ""statistically significantly better"" than government screeners in tests of airport checkpoints. But the Government Accountability Office says it ""did not notice any difference"" during covert checkpoint testing in 2007. Both groups failed to find concealed bomb components, the GAO said. Test results are not publicly disclosed. On Friday, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee, lauded Pistole's decision. ""Ending the acceptance of new applications for the program makes sense from a budgetary and counter-terrorism perspective,"" he said in a statement.","The Transportation Security Administration puts brakes on a private screening program .

"Comedian John Pinette was found dead in a Pittsburgh hotel room Saturday, the Allegheny County medical examiner's office said Monday. Pinette, 50, died of natural causes stemming from  ""a medical history he was being treated for,"" the medical examiner's spokesman said.  An autopsy will not be done since his personal doctor signed the death certificate. Pinette toured the comedy club circuit for more than two decades, but he may be best known for his role in the series finale of ""Seinfeld"" in 1998.  His character, Howie, was a carjacking victim in the last episode. Although past addiction problems ""took a toll on his body,"" Pinette was ""clean and sober"" at the end, his longtime manager Larry Schapiro said Monday. Pinette, who once weighed 450 pounds, slimmed to 250 pounds in the past two years.  His dramatic weight loss was the subject of a new comedy set he was developing that he titled ""They Call Me Slim,"" Schapiro said. His manager shared his opening line: ""You know how they say in every fat person there's a skinny person waiting to come out?  Well, mine came out, and mine was fat."" Pinette was in college working on an accounting degree when he started performing at open mic nights at Boston comedy clubs in the 1980s, Schapiro said.   He was working at a bank when he was offered $100 a night to perform at a club. ""He went to work the next day but  went to lunch and never came back,"" Schapiro said. He had a reputation among his friends and fellow comedians as a brilliant, incredibly funny and kind man. ""He couldn't walk past a homeless person without giving them a $20,"" Schapiro said. ""He would say, 'There but for the grace of God go I.' "" Comedians who knew and toured with Pinette expressed their condolences through Twitter. ""He was an extremely funny guy and a great human,"" Russell Peters said. Bob Saget wrote, ""Funny man. Kind man."" Dane Cook posted that he did a film with Pinette.  ""He was one of the most generous people I've ever worked with. A hilarious comedian. Sad loss."" ""A headliner both on an off stage,"" Bill Burr said.  ""Such a great man. Truly inspirational.""

"(CNN) -- Seven members of the Mexican military were found inside the United States on Friday, telling border agents they had become disoriented while on patrol and accidentally crossed into the country, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said. The incident began about 8 a.m. Friday, when the Border Patrol's Yuma, Arizona, sector was notified that a military-style Hummer was broken down, Customs and Border Patrol said in a written statement. Agents said they found the vehicle about 200 yards from the Colorado River, and the seven individuals were dressed in military-style clothing. Customs and Border Patrol later determined that the troops' entry was unauthorized. U.S. agents told the Mexican troops they were inside the United States and ""peaceably"" took them into custody, the statement said. ""At no time were any hostilities exchanged between the agents and military officials.""  Watch how Mexican troops found their way in the United States » . The Hummer was equipped with a turret-mounted machine gun, the Border Patrol said. According to Customs and Border Patrol, the soldiers were assigned to the 23rd Regiment Motorized Cavalry of the Mexican Army. The soldiers said they believed that they were still in Mexico because they remained on the south side of a newly constructed border fence. ""The soldiers, weapons and vehicle were placed in Border Patrol custody and transported to the CBP San Luis, Arizona, Port of Entry, where each of the subjects was processed in accordance with Border Patrol policy,"" the statement said. None of the seven had any criminal or immigration history, the agency said. The soldiers, weapons and vehicle were repatriated and ""remanded into the custody of their commanding officer,"" the Border Patrol said. The incident remains under investigation, however, and the Border Patrol's Office of Internal Affairs was notified, the statement said. ""This is not an uncommon occurrence,"" Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colorado, told CNN. ""Often times, it is the result of the Mexican military providing cover essentially for drug transportation across into our country, and/or creating a diversion so it will draw our people away from the place where the drugs are coming across."" In August, the Border Patrol said Mexican troops had crossed the border illegally 42 times since October 2007. Tancredo said the U.S. State Department lodged a complaint with the Mexican government for the first time over the military incursions a few weeks ago. Attempts to contact the State Department and the Mexican government Friday were unsuccessful. CNN's Casey Wian contributed to this report.","Mexican troops make accidental incursion into U.S., border agents say .

"Obesity rates in children 2 to 5 years old have decreased significantly over the past decade, according to a new study published Tuesday. While there were no significant changes in obesity rates for most ages between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012, researchers saw a 43% decline in this group's rates -- from 13.9% to 8.4%, according to the study published in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. A big part of a child's obesity risk is already established by age 5, according to a study published in January. The study findings were announced the same day as first lady Michelle Obama proposed new rules to limit the types of foods and beverages that can be advertised in schools and marked the fourth anniversary of her Let's Move! initiative to combat child obesity. Under the suggested federal regulations, companies would no longer be permitted to use logos of high-calorie products such as regular sodas on cups, vending machines or posters. The move is part of the first lady's ongoing efforts to combat childhood obesity in America. According to the new JAMA study, close to 17% of children aged 2 to 19 were obese in 2011-2012. That number has remained fairly constant since 2003-2004, dropping just 0.2%. More than a third of adults over 20 were obese that same year, a number that held steady over the study's time period. The prevalence is often higher in women and in Hispanic and non-Hispanic black populations. Four years ago this month, Obama announced that she was taking on childhood obesity with a new initiative called Let's Move! The comprehensive program was part parental education, part government reform -- with a bit of celebrity encouragement thrown in. ""About one-third of our children are overweight or obese. None of us want that for our country,"" Obama said at the time. ""It's time to get moving."" Let's Move! had several objectives under its broader ambition of ""solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation."" Obama wanted to increase physical activity and improve nutrition in schools, overhaul nutrition labels to make healthy choices easier for families, decrease the number of calories in restaurant meals and eliminate food deserts -- areas without access to fresh, healthy foods -- in cities across America. First Lady: Childhood obesity is about fitness, not looks . In December 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act into law, which was designed to encourage better eating habits in schools by giving the federal government more authority to set standard for food sold on school grounds. The $4.5 billion act provided more money to subsidize free meals and help administrators offset the higher costs of including more fruits and vegetables in school lunches. Then in June 2011, the USDA dismantled the traditional food pyramid and replaced it with a new icon called MyPlate. The plate emphasizes fruits and vegetables, telling Americans to fill half of every plate they eat with produce. Another quarter of the plate should be lean protein; the last quarter should be whole grains. A small portion of dairy -- perhaps a glass of low-fat milk -- can be added on the side. The first lady also tackled nutrition and physical education in childcare facilities around the country. Let's Move! offers guidelines for childcare providers: one to two hours of physical activity a day; limited screen time; more fruits and vegetables at meals served family-style when possible; no fried foods and no sugary drinks. And that's not all. ""Food manufacturers have pledged to cut 1.5 trillion calories from the products they sell. Local grocers and national chains such as Walgreens and SuperValu are building new supermarkets and expanding existing stores to sell fresh food in 1,500 underserved communities,"" Obama wrote in an op-ed for CNN in 2012. ""Restaurants are transforming their kids' menus, packing them with healthier options. Mayors are planting gardens and refurbishing parks. Congregations are sponsoring summer nutrition programs for kids and exercise ministries for families."" Even Disney and the Department of Defense are jumping on board. In January 2012, the USDA issued its new rules for school meals, which are being phased in over a three-year period. Cafeterias must offer fruits and vegetables at every meal, reduce sodium and some types of fat and keep to calorie minimums and maximums. The government agency followed up six months later with new rules for snack foods. The regulations set limits for fat, salt and sugar sold in school vending machines and snack bars. The USDA has faced opposition over the new rules -- from student athletes who say they're not getting enough calories to administrators who say kids just aren't buying the healthier options. Which raises the question: With all these new guidelines and regulations, are kids really getting any healthier? It's a difficult question to answer, as the most comprehensive data collections about obesity are still a few years behind. But there have been signs of progress. Steven Hanus, a elementary physical education teacher in the Chicago suburbs, says he's noticed a change in his students -- and their parents -- over the past five years. Overall, the kids are in better shape, he says. Parents are asking Hanus more questions as well, about how to keep their kids moving at home. And he's received strong support from administrators in his quest to find new ways to interest students in fitness. Recently, his first-graders were given pedometers for the first time. Related: Not your mama's gym class . ""From our top level down, the initiative to keep kids moving and active has definitely been a big part of the district,"" Hanus says. ""It's made us all a little more aware of how active we are."" Another study published in August 2013 that analyzed data from preschool children in low-income families showed a small but significant decline in the group's obesity rates between 2008 and 2011. ""It's a bright spot for our nation's young kids, but the fight is very far from over,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said at the time. Obama agrees. ""While childhood obesity rates are beginning to fall, we still have a long way to go before we solve this problem once and for all,"" the first lady said Tuesday. ""We can't slow down and we can't turn back now."" Let's Move! recommends children engage in physical activity for a total of 60 minutes every day, and adults should move for 30 minutes daily.

"(CNN)  -- Ramadan is the holiest month for Muslims around the world, a time to fast, cleanse the soul and surrender to God. But in the Middle East, there's a new twist to the tradition. Arab channels' soap operas contain enough twists to entertain through the month of Ramadan. Ramadan translates into big bucks for Arab satellite channels. Millions of dollars are spent on special programming, much of it comparable to Western soap operas, to entertain the masses during their sunrise-to-sunset fasts. One program, the popular Syrian production ""Baab El-Hara"" -- ""The Neighborhood Gate"" -- offers high drama focused on a family feud. A man and his pregnant wife are separated as their mothers fight it out, with each mother-in-law trying to teach the other a lesson. The woman misses her husband and wants to go back to him. The husband kisses his mother's hand and promises her he'll do only what she wants. The soaps showcase social traditions mixed with melodramatic characters and enough twists and turns of events to last the entire month of fasting. But it's not all soap. There are also history programs highlighting glorious times of Islamic and Arabic bygone eras. On these, the ancient Arabic tribal costumes are showcased, complete with the traditional headdress, dagger on the side and more camels than a viewer can count.  Watch a report on Ramadan television » . The soap opera boom during Ramadan has become the subject of hot debate on news channels. Some people have expressed concern that sitting in front of a TV set all day doesn't go well with the spirit of the month, when Muslims are supposed to be contemplating and meditating. The Dubai-based news channel Al-Arabiya found a novel way to entertain its viewers: a documentary in which the host walks in the footsteps of the prophet Mohammed as detailed in the Quran. The channel also offers a daily lighter look at Ramadan, focusing on people's health during the holy month. Recommendations on the best meals to eat are followed by descriptions of how many calories they contain. Middle Eastern cuisine is displayed to viewers just in time to break fast. That, too, is announced on TV these days, instead of the traditional cannon and call to prayer. And if Muslims decide to break their fasts with a traditional shisha smoke and a light meal in a neighborhood cafe, no worries. Satellite channels will serve them soaps there, too. It's all part of the big plan, and it happens only during Ramadan.","Arab TV channels spend millions to entertain Muslims during Ramadan fasts .

"The Supreme Court concluded a marathon public debate on health care Wednesday with justices signaling an ideological divide that could topple some or all of the the sweeping reform bill championed by President Barack Obama. On the third day of oral arguments on legal challenges to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the justices tackled the question of what would happen if they ruled that the heart of the law, the individual mandate that is its key funding mechanism, was unconstitutional. The six hours of hearings over three days provided an extended public view of the high court in action on one of the most controversial issues of the day, touching on legal concepts involving federal and state powers, individual rights and legislative intent. High court listens to arguments on Medicaid expansion . At stake is the survival of the signature legislation of Obama's presidency as he seeks re-election in November: the health care reform law that requires most  Americans to have health coverage as part of a systemic overhaul intended to lower  costs. The justices looked at procedural issues Monday and then tackled the heart of the law Tuesday, the constitutionality of the individual mandate that requires people to get health coverage or pay a fine. High court divided over health care mandate . At issue Wednesday morning was whether all the law's 450 or so provisions would have to be scrapped if the individual mandate were found unconstitutional. A separate session Wednesday afternoon looked at whether states would be ""coerced"" by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration by the risk of losing federal funding if they refuse. To CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, the questioning by justices Wednesday signaled they are ready to invalidate the individual mandate, a step he said could put the entire law in jeopardy. ""I think the individual mandate is gone, based on the questioning,"" Toobin said after the morning session.  ""It sure looks like there are at least five votes to get rid of ... the individual mandate."" Listen to oral arguments in the historic case . White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Obama administration remained confident its signature health care law is constitutional. Anyone who tries to predict the outcome of the case based on the questions justices asked during this week's arguments ""is not a very good student of the Supreme Court,"" Earnest told reporters, adding that Justice Department lawyers faced similar tough questions from conservative judges in lower courts that later upheld the law ""in at least a couple of these cases."" However, some of the attorneys general of states opposing the health care law said the three days of arguments showed the justices had serious concerns about the law. ""What we've heard over the last few days is a growing concern from our Supreme Court justices about, perhaps, the federal government has gone too far at the expense of individual liberty and our states' rights,"" said South Dakota Attorney General Marty J. Jackley. Even though the health care law's individual mandate appeared to be on shaky legal ground, few on the court seemed eager to take the drastic step of throwing out the rest of the legislation. Read a transcript of Wednesday's arguments . ""There are so many things in this act that are unquestionably OK,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, citing many provisions not directly related to market reforms such as Native American health care. ""Why make Congress redo those? I mean it's a question of whether we say everything you do is no good, now start from scratch."" Added Justice Elena Kagan, ""Half a loaf is better than no loaf,"" meaning some provisions would survive. However, lawyer Paul Clement, arguing for opponents of the law, told the justices that removing such a central provision of the law as the individual mandate would leave ""sort of a hollow shell"" that never would have passed Congress in such a diminished form. In addition, conservative justices appeared in no mood to pick and choose what to uphold in the rest of the law. ""You want us to go through 2,700 pages"" of the law? asked Justice Antonin Scalia. ""Is this not totally unrealistic ... to go through one by one and decide each one?"" Supreme Court, health care and one little girl . Justice Anthony Kennedy said he was reluctant to take on this ""awesome exercise of judicial power,"" at the expense of congressional discretion. This week's hearings were among the most politically charged and closely watched in years, with dueling protests and news conferences outside the court building every day on what is likely to be a central issue of the November presidential election. Overheard on CNN.com: Readers react to hearingsRep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, a staunch opponent of the health care law, said Wednesday the entire measure falls apart if the Supreme Court invalidates the individual mandate. ""The individual mandate would be the funding stream that makes all of the rest of the act work,"" Bachmann said. If it gets ruled unconstitutional, then who pays for all the other provisions in the 2,700-page bill? she asked. Supporters argued that under legal precedent set by the court, the full health care law should be ruled constitutional. ""For the court to strike down this law would be to presume the powers of the Congress and abandon its role as an impartial and deliberate decider of constitutional law,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. Another Senate Democrat, John Kerry of Massachusetts, acknowledged that supporters are looking at all possible outcomes. ""There is discussion quietly among some people about 'what ifs,' but there is no overall, you know, plan in place because I think that people have confidence the court will do the right thing,"" Kerry said. CNN's guide to the arguments . With the legal survival of the individual mandate in constitutional jeopardy, the question of ""severability,"" whether the rest of the law can stand if one part is invalidated, has become more important. All of this may be moot. If the court decides the mandate is constitutional -- even in a narrowly tailored way -- it will not even bother to take up the severability question presented Wednesday. In the morning arguments, the clearly divided court expressed concern over whether Congress would have passed the broad reform package without the key funding mechanism, the mandate, firmly in place. However, several of the justices seemed ready to let lawmakers eventually sort out the specific funding questions with or without the mandate. The nine-member bench now will retreat from the public spotlight. They will likely gather as a group in a closed-door conference over the next few days and actually decide on the four health care appeals. Going one-by-one in order of seniority, they will all be thinking of the number five, which is how many votes it will take to achieve a majority. Two families, two viewpoints on health care reform . Once the tallies are sorted out, opinions will be assigned to individuals to craft over the next three months. What the court says in these written opinions, how it interprets the Constitution, will be far more important than what was said in the oral arguments this week. The rulings may be in essence how legislators, individual Americans and history will judge these justices. Wednesday's cases gave the administration another chance to regain the rhetorical offensive and defend the entire law's validity. Many legal observers concluded the Obama administration's solicitor general, Donald Verrilli Jr., did little to boost the individual mandate's constitutionality in two hours of intense arguments Tuesday. The questioning of Verrilli's performance was so widespread that the White House issued a statement Wednesday defending him. ""Mr. Verrilli is an extraordinarily talented advocate who possesses a sharp mind, keen judgment and unquestionable integrity,"" said the statement by White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler. ""He ably and skillfully represented the United States before the Supreme Court yesterday, and we have every confidence that he will continue to do so."" Wednesday's first argument dealt with severability, but most court watchers think of it as the ""domino effect"" issue -- if the individual mandate section is ruled unconstitutional, must the entire law collapse as well? A federal judge in Florida had so ruled in February 2011, saying: ""Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable, the entire act must be declared void."" However, a federal appeals court subsequently overruled on the severability question while upholding the individual mandate's unconstitutionality. Opponents of the law say the individual mandate is crucial to its overall impact, since it is the main funding mechanism for the expansion of a range of other programs. This might be the one question on which the justices will ultimately agree in favor of the government. The high court and election-year blockbusters . Later came the Medicaid ""coercion"" question, which can be seen as the ""national policy implications"" issue. Through this issue, the long-standing fight over ""federalism"" and the leverage the national government wields over states might soon reach epic levels with a high court decision either strengthening or limiting congressional authority on this and potentially a host of other regulatory areas. The cases argued Wednesday were National Federation of Business v. Sebelius (11-393) and Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services (11-400).","The Supreme Court ends its three days of hearings on health care reform .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- The death toll rose to three Friday from Israeli airstrikes along the Gaza Strip, officials said. Israeli Defense Forces said it launched four airstrikes along the Gaza Strip on Thursday, targeting a weapons shop and two smuggling tunnels. The strikes also hit a third tunnel, described as a ""terror tunnel"" with access to Israel, an IDF spokeswoman told CNN. Three Palestinians were killed and several others were injured in the airstrikes, Hamas security sources said Friday. Initially, the Hamas sources said one person was killed and four were injured. The sources said a secret metal shop used to make Qassam rockets was hit in Gaza City. IDF confirmed the strike. The airstrikes were in response to a series of rockets and mortar shells fired into Israel earlier Thursday, the IDF spokeswoman said. Four mortars struck the Kerem Shalom humanitarian-aid crossing on the tip of southern Gaza, forcing authorities to shut it down and prevent 70 trucks carrying fuel and other aid from entering the strip, she added. Qassam rockets are homemade projectiles that have been fired into communities in southern Israel for years. Though they are crudely made, militants have made efforts to improve the weapons' technology. Israel routinely targets the Rafah tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border, which it says Hamas uses to smuggle weapons into Palestinian territory. Palestinians say the tunnels are needed to get basic food supplies that are not available in Gaza.","Three killed in airstrikes carried out by Israeli military along the Gaza Strip .

"The sight of Dr. Kent Brantly, a victim of the Ebola virus, walking from an ambulance to the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta in his hazmat suit may become an iconic photo of modern American history. Brantly served the poor and infirm and put his own life in jeopardy serving patients in Liberia, so you would think that he would be received as a hero, admired for his work, and held up as an example of the highest calling of his profession and his religion. The same is true of his colleague, American Liberia volunteer Nancy Writebol, who just arrived in the States for treatment. But not everyone seems to think so. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has received hate e-mails and phone calls.  An op-ed in Bloomberg View questions who made the decision to bring Brantly home, and social media is abuzz with demands that Ebola victims not be admitted to the United States at all.  The New York Post proclaimed ""Ebola fear is going viral"" and quoted one of Donald Trump's tweets: ""Ebola patient will be brought to the U.S. in a few days -- Now I know for sure that our leaders are incompetent. KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!"" This kind of reaction is, unfortunately, nothing new for the United States. The U.S. has a history of irrational panic over disease and other perceived dangers, of behaving badly about them and then feeling remorseful later. Perhaps it all started with the Salem witch trials, which became the template for similar panics throughout our history. Ebola is here: 5 reasons not to panic . The American fear that an epidemic was corrupting our health, our morals, or our children has inspired movements to ban the waltz, rock and roll, romance novels, comic books, and Dungeons and Dragons. Of course, unlike dancing or computer games, disease really can cause epidemics and threaten our health and our lives. Early in an epidemic, especially of a new disease, we are often unsure of the cause, the mode of transmission, or the degree of contagiousness of a disease. What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? But even when we know the nature and cause of a disease, irrational panics still seem to grip us.  As an issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association lamented, ""When the public fears contagion from a dangerous disease, all unselfish considerations and regard for anything except personal safety are often forgotten."" The quote is from an article in 1910, and refers to the public's fear that cancer was contagious and belief that people with the disease should be isolated and shunned. It seems, a century later, we have still not learned our lesson. ""AIDS hysteria"" became a familiar term in the late 1980s, and despite scientific certainty over its mode of transmission, a 1986 poll by the Los Angeles Times found that 50% of the adults surveyed supported a quarantine of AIDS patients, 48% approved of identity cards for people who tested positive for the antibody to the virus, and 15% favored tattooing AIDS victims for easy identification. Like Ebola, HIV-AIDS is not spread casually. But also like Ebola, AIDS was first associated with a minority population feared by many in the majority. Infection seems somehow all the worse when spread by those we fear or disdain. What to know about Ebola . The stories of cruelty and lack of compassion for those who suffered from AIDS are  well documented and relegated to the history of American shame. Yet the compassionate treatment of the sick is a fundamental tenet of all the major religions, East and West, and forms the moral basis of the American medical and public health systems. American citizens, especially those who become sick through service to the needy in other parts of the world, need to know that America stands ready to welcome them back and to care for them as best we can. We know exactly how Ebola is contracted and how it spreads. We have perfectly safe procedures to keep it contained. Despite the severity of the outbreak in Africa, Ebola is not spread quickly like the flu or a cold. It involves contact with bodily fluids that are easily contained with the proper precautions. American hospitals deal with such infectious diseases every day -- in fact, the Ebola virus has been in research labs all over the United States for years without an incident of infection. Visitors to the United States have brought other African hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola with them, and have been discovered and treated here. How many cases have these infectious visitors -- who were not in hazmat suits and isolation rooms -- spread to other Americans?  None. There are two epidemics in the world today. The first is a troubling spread of the Ebola virus in poor countries in Africa, an outbreak that is the result of poverty, inattention by those countries' political leaders, and a general lack of concern by the wealthier nations about epidemics that don't yet seem to directly affect them. But the second epidemic is a more dangerous one. It is a spreading lack of compassion, characterized by disaster fatigue, helplessness in the face of war refugees, intolerance for immigration, and now, the desire to ban even American citizens who are sick and need our help. The second epidemic seems harder to contain than the first, but it is every bit as important.","Donald Trump, bloggers, op-ed writers say we should keep Americans with Ebola out .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A report from the U.S. State Department details ""an upsurge"" across the world of anti-Semitism -- hostility and discrimination toward Jewish people. ""Today, more than 60 years after the Holocaust, anti-Semitism is not just a fact of history, it is a current event,"" the report says. The report -- called Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism and given to Congress on Thursday -- is dedicated to the memory of the late U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos, a survivor of the Holocaust, the extermination of 6 million Jews during World War II. The report details physical acts of anti-Semitism, such as attacks, property damage, and cemetery desecration. It also lists manifestations such as conspiracy theories concerning Jews, Holocaust denial, anti-Zionism and the demonization of Israel. ""Over much of the past decade, U.S. embassies worldwide have noted an increase in anti-Semitic incidents, such as attacks on Jewish people, property, community institutions, and religious facilities,"" the report says. The report also deals with efforts to combat the bigotry, described by Gregg J. Rickman, the department's special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism, as ""one of the oldest forms of malicious intolerance."" The report says violent acts and desecration of Jewish property happen whether there are a lot of Jews or only a few  living in the region. Bigoted rhetoric, conspiracy theories regarding Jews, and anti-Semitic propaganda are transmitted over the airwaves and on the Internet. It says that although Nazism and fascism are rejected by the West ""and beyond,"" blatant forms of anti-Semitism are ""embraced and employed by the extreme fringe."" ""Traditional forms of anti-Semitism persist and can be found across the globe. Classic anti-Semitic screeds, such as 'The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion' and 'Mein Kampf' remain commonplace. ""Jews continue to be accused of blood libel, dual loyalty, and undue influence on government policy and the media, and the symbols and images associated with age-old forms of anti-Semitism endure."" New forms of anti-Semitism are reflected in rhetoric that compares Israel to the Nazis and attributes ""Israel's perceived faults to its Jewish character."" This kind of anti-Semitism, the report says, ""is common throughout the Middle East and in Muslim communities in Europe, but it is not confined to these populations."" The report says various U.N. bodies are regularly asked to launch ""investigations of what often are sensationalized reports of alleged atrocities and other violations of human rights by Israel."" ""The collective effect of unremitting criticism of Israel, coupled with a failure to pay attention to regimes that are demonstrably guilty of grave violations, has the effect of reinforcing the notion that the Jewish state is one of the sources, if not the greatest source, of abuse of the rights of others, and thus intentionally or not encourages anti-Semitism."" The report gives examples of leaders and governments that ""fan the flames of anti-Semitic hatred within their own societies and even beyond their borders."" It cites Syria, Belarus, Venezuela, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. ""Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has actively promoted Holocaust denial, Iran's Jewish population faces official discrimination, and the official media outlets regularly produce anti-Semitic propaganda,"" the report adds. It notes ""societal anti-Semitism"" in places where there have been efforts to fight the problem. Among the countries are Poland, Ukraine, Russia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. ""Recent increases in anti-Semitic incidents have been documented in Argentina, Australia, Canada, South Africa, and beyond,"" the report said.

"(CNN) -- Fifty-three people were killed in a 72-hour span in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, making it one of the deadliest three-day periods in recent memory, state attorney general's office spokesman Arturo Sandoval told CNN Sunday. Among the dead were four police officers from three different agencies, Sandoval said. ""This is the worst violence we've seen this year,"" he said, referring to the three days from Thursday through Saturday. The bloodshed started on Thursday with 14 people killed, including a municipal police officer. Friday was the most violent day, leaving 20 people dead. A municipal police officer was killed by an assassin who belonged to a band of carjackers. Hours later, a state police investigator was executed on his drive home. On Saturday, a highway police officer was killed by a driver who confronted the patrolman after the officer gave him a ticket. The officer was shot 10 times at close range in the middle of the afternoon. In all, 19 people were killed that day in separate shootings throughout the city. Elsewhere Sunday, Mexico's Public Security Secretariat reported that 13 taxi drivers were killed in the resort town of Acapulco in a rash of violence that began early Friday. Suspected drug traffickers are believed to be behind the violence, setting cars ablaze and destroying street lights and security cameras. Among the casualties, a human head was discovered on a street and another body was found near a charred vehicle. The security office said four people were arrested in connection with the killings, and an investigation is ongoing. Juarez is one of Mexico's deadliest cities and an epicenter of drug cartel violence. The Juarez cartel and the Sinaloa cartel are fighting a bloody turf war in the region for lucrative smuggling routes, and for drug-dealing territory in the city. The sudden spike in violence left the city morgue overwhelmed. There were issues with where to store the bodies. In light of the violence, Juarez Mayor Hector ""Teto"" Murguia is expected to name a new municipal police chief on Monday, local newspapers reported. Municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez told CNN he has read those reports, but that the police department has no official confirmation that a new chief will be appointed. ""At this time we continue serving our current boss until we are given new orders,"" Sanchez said. In the first 40 days of 2011, Juarez is averaging eight homicides per day, Sandoval said. Also, in February, at least 24 women have been killed in 20 days. CNN's Berta Ramos contributed to this report .","NEW: Rash of killings is also reported in Acapulco .

"The air many of us breathe poses serious health risks, the World Health Organization says. On Thursday, it added cancer to the list. Air pollution is a now officially a carcinogen, and there are no caveats about the new classification. ""We know that it is causing cancer in humans,"" said spokesman Kurt Straif. In 2010, lung cancer resulting from air pollution took the lives of 223,000 people worldwide.  As pollution levels climb, so will the rate of cancer, the WHO said. And there is only one way to stop it: Clean up the air. ""We can't treat ourselves out of this cancer problem,"" said Chris Wild, who heads the WHO's cancer research wing, the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Cleaner air would also have other health benefits. Air pollution increases the risk of bladder cancer, the IARC said.  It has been known for a while that it contributes to heart disease and respiratory ailments. The problem is global, but people in developing countries with large populations and booming manufacturing sectors with few pollution controls are said to be particularly at risk. ""The predominant sources of outdoor air pollution are transportation, stationary power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions, and residential heating and cooking,"" the IARC said. Outdoor dust can also contribute to cancer. The agency decided upon the official classification of outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic after reviewing the latest scientific writings and coming to the conclusion that the evidence was ample. The classification is an important step, said Dr. Christopher Wild, director of the IARC. ""There are effective ways to reduce air pollution and, given the scale of the exposure affecting people worldwide, this report should send a strong signal to the international community to take action without further delay."" The IARC called air pollution the most widespread environmental carcinogen and the worst.","""We know that it is causing cancer in humans,"" scientist says .

"(CNN) -- Self-confessed BlackBerry addict President Barack Obama may not have to kick the thumbing habit after all, despite the concerns of a notoriously technophobic White House. Obama was a self-confessed BlackBerry addict during his White House campaign. ""The president has a BlackBerry,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday, clearing up weeks of speculation about whether President Obama would be able to hold on to a cherished method of communicating. The decision to allow Obama to keep a smartphone is ""a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends,"" Gibbs told the media in his first press conference since the inauguration. ""Use will be limited and the security is enhanced to ensure his ability to communicate but to do so effectively,"" Gibbs also said. ""And to do so in a way that is protected."" The press secretary refused to provide more details about the new president's device, already being called the ""BarackBerry.""  Watch CNN's Errol Barnett reports on the president's new phone » . Obama was often seen hunched over the mobile e-mail cell phone device during his election campaign and even featured at No. 2 on one celebrity Web site's list of obsessive BlackBerry users. But, like previous Oval Office incumbents, Obama had been expected to take a vow of technological celibacy following his inaugural oath on Tuesday, despite telling CNBC in an interview that security officials would have to ""pry it out of my hands."" He said a mobile device would help him stay in touch with the real world. Should President Obama be allowed to keep his BlackBerry? Tell us what you think . E-mail has long been treated with suspicion by the Secret Service because of fears it could be hacked into by foreign espionage agencies, or that sensitive information could reach the public domain via a single mistaken strike of the ""send"" key. President George W. Bush was forced to give up using e-mail when he took charge, while President Bill Clinton sent just two e-mails during his administration -- one to test that the system worked and the second to veteran astronaut John Glenn before his trip into space in 1998. There are also concerns that mobile devices such as the BlackBerry, which contain built-in GPS technology, could be hacked, revealing the president's location within a few feet. But according to reports Thursday, Obama may actually have been issued a spy-proof alternative to his favorite toy. Writing on his blog for the Atlantic magazine, Marc Ambinder reports that the National Security Agency has approved a $3,350 smartphone -- inevitably dubbed the ""BarackBerry"" -- for Obama's use. The exclusive Sectera Edge, made by General Dynamics, is reportedly capable of encrypting top secret voice conversations and handling classified documents. But Obama may have pushed his Secret Service handlers' technological patience far enough. Ambinder also reports that instant messaging in the White House will still be a definite no-no. CNN's Martina Stewart contributed to this report.","Report: Security officials approve $3,350 smartphone for Barack Obama .

"(CNN) -- The next time you see a motorist obliviously straddling two lanes, don't fault bad driving, but genetics. In a study published recently in the journal Cerebral Cortex, researcher Steven Cramer found that people with a certain gene variant performed more than 30 percent worse on a driving test than people without it. The study by Cramer, a neurology professor at the University of California Irvine, might also help explain why there are so many bad drivers on U.S. highways: About 30 percent of Americans have the variant. Ordinarily, when a person performs a task, a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is secreted to the area of the brain that is associated with that activity. The protein helps facilitate communication among brain cells and helps retain memory. However in people who have the gene variation that Cramer studied, BDNF secretion is limited. ""These people make more errors from the get-go, and they forget more of what they learned after time away,"" Cramer said in a statement. Cramer and his team of researchers set out to find how the variant affected driving. They recruited 29 people to drive 15 laps on a simulated course with difficult curves and turns. Twenty-two of the participants did not have the gene variant; seven did. The researchers wanted to see how effectively the participants learned to navigate the twists and turns in each subsequent lap. Four days later, they repeated the test. The participants with the variant did worse both times. They also retained less the second go-round. ""I'd be curious to know the genetics of people who get into car crashes,"" Cramer said. ""I wonder if the accident rate is higher for drivers with the variant."" Unfortunately, a test to determine whether someone has the gene variant is not commercially available.","Study finds bad driving may have genetic basis .

"The campaigns of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney don't agree on much. But on one subject, officials from both sides are in sync. As the GOP primary race goes into its third official month, the biggest winner appears to be the president. Referring to rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, a Romney campaign staffer said, ""The only person's odds of winning are increasing are President Barack Obama's,"" arguing it was time for Gingrich and Santorum to depart the race. Several leading Republicans have publicly echoed that sentiment in recent days, confronted with poll numbers showing the president's job approval rating above 50% for the first time in months -- a far cry from last fall when he was mired in the low 40s. The ongoing Republican infighting has dragged down Romney's favorability rating among swing voters, forced him to awkwardly pivot right from stances that otherwise would have resonated with a broader electorate in the fall and led to a series of gaffes that could have been avoided had the former Massachusetts governor sewed up the nomination weeks ago. All the while, Obama's own campaign machinations have largely skated under the radar, allowing him to appear to be the adult in the room as the Republican candidates fight over contraception, illegal immigration, the minimum wage and each others' pasts. In the process, Obama's favorability among key voting blocs such as women and Latinos has jumped significantly.  And most important, recent surveys suggest the president has rebounded among independent voters, a swath of the electorate that catapulted him to victory four years ago but had abandoned him during his presidency. Equally disturbing to Republicans are a series of recent surveys showing the president handily beating Romney in a head-to-head contest, a reversal from October when Romney held a slight lead. That trend led conservative stalwart George Will last week to forecast Romney is headed for a Barry Goldwater-esque defeat come November. Ongoing Republican sniping has also allowed the Obama campaign to steadily build its campaign apparatus behind the scenes, opening scores of field offices in every key state out of which staffers and volunteers methodically resurrect the unparalleled get-out-the-vote effort from four years ago. ""We're using this time to build while they're destroying each other,"" top Obama adviser David Axelrod said earlier this week. The campaign has also restricted its advertising to one positive spot on the president's energy policy, a subject Democrats believe will be among the key issues in the fall as gas prices rise. The campaign is also set to release a 17-minute documentary-style video next week showcasing the president's achievements during his first term. At the same time, Obama's lack of a direct opponent has allowed him to stay on message and conduct the re-election bid on his own terms. Conveniently, Obama avoids commenting on his likely Republican opponent until the nomination is actually wrapped up. But that hasn't stopped the president from goading the Republicans at nearly every turn, often trying to upstage them -- like his White House news conference on the GOP's Super Tuesday -- before every key primary this season. Of course, it was only four years ago when some Democrats were making similar doom-and-gloom predictions about their own contentious nominating fight, during which then-Sen. Hillary Clinton and Obama exchanged heated rhetoric well into May. But forecasts that such bickering would harm the eventual nominee's candidacy were all but forgotten two months later when Clinton offered a resounding endorsement of her onetime opponent at the Democrats' national convention. Meanwhile, fears that Clinton's ardent supporters wouldn't vote for Obama come November largely never materialized. Republicans are holding out hope for a similar outcome on their side, mindful that most Americans aren't paying close heed to the ins and outs of the GOP race. ""I get the feeling there's a real disconnect between the political class that's paying attention to all of this and what the public thinks,"" said Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary to President George W. Bush and a CNN contributor. He's predicting that most of the GOP infighting will be forgotten once the party rallies around a nominee. ""I'm seeing more and more conservatives who aren't Romney fans starting to say, 'You know what, it's time to start fighting Barack Obama and stop fighting ourselves,' "" Erick Erickson, a CNN contributor and founder of Redstate.com, said earlier this week. But senior officials on the president's campaign argue the parallels between 2008 and 2012 are tenuous at best.  For starters, the long Democratic primary campaign four years ago was widely believed to burnish Obama as a candidate.  Not so with Romney, who has made a string of verbal missteps and shows little sign of getting more comfortable on the campaign trail. Democrats also argue the Obama and Clinton sniping pales in comparison to that of the Republican candidates this year, each of whom have spent millions of dollars on negative commercials and have sparred repeatedly during 20 televised debates. The result is a Republican primary electorate largely unsatisfied with its crop of candidates and showing little enthusiasm at the polls. ""That lack of enthusiasm among Republicans is real, and it's unmistakable,"" said Jim Messina, the president's campaign manager, pointing to low voter turnout figures.  Adding to that contention is a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showing GOP enthusiasm since the fall has ticked down 13 points, to 51%. Finally, the president's supporters maintain Obama and Clinton did not shift leftward on key positions during their primary battle, forestalling the need for an awkward trek back to the middle during the fall campaign. In contrast, Romney has been forced to embrace more conservative positions on several key issues that could make courting independent voters difficult come November. ""They think they can wipe the slate clean,"" Axelrod said. ""The American people take his words seriously and his positions seriously ... we're going to hold him to them.""","Some leading Republicans think it's time to wrap up the race .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- If the exhibition on the waters of San Francisco Bay Monday is anything to go by, the 34th America's Cup to be held on these waters in 2013 is going to be fast, exciting, and potentially dangerous.

Oracle Racing says one crewman suffered minor rib injuries and was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure. Oracle Racing, practicing publicly for the first time on their home waters with their new AC45 class boats, seemed to take it all in stride. ""The boats are spectacular, hard to sail.

"On a day when President Barack Obama trumpeted support of strengthening equal pay laws, a question about pay disparity between male and female staffers within the White House seemed to catch the administration a bit off guard. Special Coverage: 2014 Midterm Elections . An analysis by the conservative American Enterprise Institute found that women staffers made about 88 cents on the dollar, compared with male staffers. Female federal workers in the early years of the Obama administration had a median salary of nearly 93% of what their male colleagues earn, according to 2011 figures from the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an agency that works to protect the rights of federal employees. And while that figure for female federal worker earnings was up from just over 83 percent in 1991, it doesn't exactly match the type of pay parity the White House was touting. ""What I can tell you is that we have, as an institution here, have aggressively addressed this challenge, and obviously, though, at the 88 cents that you cite, that is not a hundred, but it is better than the national average,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday. ""And when it comes to the bottom line that women who do the same work as men have to be paid the same, there is no question that that is happening here at the White House at every level."" Obama strengthens equal pay protections . Two deputy chiefs of staff in the White House - one male and one female - Carney said, make the same salary. Carney's correct, women's studies scholars say. The White House and federal government's rates of pay parity are better than the national average of ""77 cents for every dollar a man earns,"" figure the President noted in his State of the Union address. Equal pay: 5 things you need to know . However, the fact that even an administration that prides itself on having made its first priority signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law, hasn't achieved equal pay for equal work demonstrates the complexity in reaching complete parity, said Jennifer Lawless, director of Women & Politics Institute at American University. ""There's also a lot of misinformation out there,"" Lawless said. ""I don't think most people understand the dynamics of it and the complications involved. Most people believe there should be pay parity but they separate the process from the outcome."" Democrats highlight equal pay in political push . Those dynamics include child rearing roles, age, education, race, ethnicity and even where someone lives. For instance, a woman might find her earnings decreased if she temporarily left the workforce to raise a young child and an African-American or Hispanic woman is more likely to earn less than her white female counterpart. For example, ""among women, median weekly earnings for mothers of children under age 18 were $680, slightly below the earnings for women without children under 18 ($697),"" according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Highlights of Women's Earnings in 2012 report. ""Among men, earnings for fathers with children under 18 were $946, compared with $799 for men without children under 18."" The gap has closed somewhat for millennial workers. ""Among younger workers, the earnings differences between women and men were not as great,"" the BLS notes. ""Among workers who were 25 to 34 years old, women earned 90 percent of what men earned; among 16- to 24-year-olds, women earned 89 percent as much as men."" The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act the President signed in 2009 gave women more time to sue for pay discrimination. On Monday, Obama signed executive orders that encourage federal contractors to make pay information more transparent, so women and minorities will know if they are being treated equally. As for getting to pay parity within the White House and across the federal government -- well, that might take a while. ""It's not parity,"" Lawless said. ""But it's closer than what we see elsewhere which suggests a move in the right direction."" Opinion: Equal pay or opportunity for outrage?

"Over a million visitors travel to the rock-cut architectural wonders of Petra, Jordan each year. The magnificent rose-red city was first established sometime in the 6th century B.C. by an ancient nomadic tribe called the Nabataeans. At the crossroads between Arabia, Egypt, and Syria-Phonecia, it became one of the most vibrant trading hubs in the region -- a caravan center for the silks of China, the spices of India and the incense of Arabia. Today, tourists must make the two kilometer walk down a narrow gorge known as ""The Siq"" before being rewarded with the awe-inspiring sight of the dusky-pink face of Al-Khazneh or the ""Treasury."" It is the first of an array of magnificent sights, including elaborate rock-cut tombs, sacrificial altars, a roman amphitheater and the Al-Deir monastery, housed in the 264,000 square meters of Petra Archeological Park. Few realize that among these relics of an ancient people there are still those living in the area that maintain the traditional nomadic way of life. ""(The Bedouins) are here as controller for these caves, for all Petra. Because Petra is very important to them,"" said Jehad Hamadeen of the Petra Archaeological Park. The Bedouin community has been drifting across the sand since long before Jordan existed. The name in their native tongue of Arabic literally means ""desert dwellers,"" and for centuries they have carved a life in this harsh landscape. Despite often being isolated, the Bedouin people are known for their hospitality to travelers and are often happy to share a meal with visitors they come across. ""My happiness is here. I love this place,"" said Um Mohammed, a Petra resident and Bedouin native. ""I walk around in these lands, these open lands. No one tells me what to do, (I) am by myself.""

""Yes it is our duty, and the duty of the government,"" he said. ""It is an archaeological site. This is the most important thing."" But Ismail also points out that the Bedouin way of life needs to be protected and old traditions need to be upheld. He says: ""The best things about it (are) the fresh air, no traffic and street hassle. It is the Bedouin life, it's great.

"Haven't we heard this before? With President Barack Obama weighing possible responses to what the United States calls a major chemical weapons attack in Syria, some are warning of another potential open-ended war if America launches an expected military strike. Obama's options appear to range from limited missile strikes in Syria to continued diplomatic efforts -- what critics contend is a ""do-nothing"" approach. U.S. officials have concluded the Syrian government carried out chemical weapons attacks, the president said Wednesday. ""We have looked at all the evidence, and we do not believe the opposition possessed nuclear weapons on -- or chemical weapons of that sort. We do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that the opposition could have carried out these attacks. We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out. And if that's so, then there need to be international consequences,"" Obama told ""PBS NewsHour."" He also said that he has ""not made a decision"" about whether to conduct a limited military strike or a strike of over a limited time period in Syria. While noted hawks such as GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona call for a robust response intended to weaken Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and turn the tide of the nation's civil war, others worry that the inevitable result will be an inextricable mess.

Sanchez, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, added that ""for Americans to believe that just by shooting a few cruise missiles, we've made our statement and away we go, it's just not the way that I believe this plays out, if that happens."" Her fellow California Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee, said the large-scale use of chemical weapons demanded an international response, but he called for a precisely defined mission intended to limit collateral political fallout or open-ended U.S. involvement. ""I think the use of chemical weapons is really different, qualitatively different, tragically different, and I think we really have to act here,"" Schiff said. Obama must ""make it clear not only to the American people but also to the Syrian people that this isn't going to be the cavalry riding to the rescue to topple"" Assad, he said. At the same time, ""this is going to be a punitive, powerful response, a deterrent response to the use of chemical weapons,"" Schiff said. ""That's important to make sure that we don't get entangled in this war, to try and avoid the consequences"" cited by Sanchez, he said. ""But I think properly defined, it can be done.  And I think it will be done in concert with our international partners."" McCain said that only a tough response will be effective. ""If it's just some strikes with cruise missiles, then it will not only not do any good, it may be counterproductive and help Bashar Assad with his propaganda,"" McCain said. He called for reversing the advantage held by Assad's forces on the battlefield ""by taking out his air assets, cratering his runways and getting the weapons to the right people so that they can reverse the momentum."" However, Ed Husain of the Council on Foreign Relations said Obama risks wading into a protracted war that will become his legacy with hasty military strikes now. ""By intervening, Syria may well prove to be Obama's war, bequeathed to a new president in 2016,"" Husain, a senior fellow for Middle East studies, wrote Wednesday on CNN's website. ""Civilian casualties are inevitable: The images on our screens will not be Syrians using chemical weapons to kill each other, but American bombs creating carnage and killings in yet another Muslim country."" Syria warns West amid growing talk of military strike . White House: No decision yet . White House spokesman Jay Carney insisted Tuesday that Obama continued to weigh options, and he made clear that any U.S. response to the August 21 use of chemical weapons in suburban Damascus was not intended to bring ""regime change."" ""We can't wait. We need to act according to our own national interests,"" a senior U.S. official said Wednesday. The official echoed the idea that the president has not yet made a decision, but added: ""This is moving quickly."" Meanwhile, efforts by the Obama administration to mount international support reaped some benefits. Major NATO partners Britain, France and Germany have called for a tough response in Syria, and a NATO statement Wednesday signaled support for action. ""Those responsible must be held accountable,"" the statement said. ""We consider the use of chemical weapons as a threat to international peace and security."" The NATO language echoed Carney's remarks that sought to justify a military response to what U.S. officials characterize as the worst chemical weapons attack since former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein launched a poison gas attack that killed thousands of Kurds in 1988. ""Allowing the use of chemical weapons on a significant scale to take place without a response would present a significant challenge to or threat to the United States' national security,"" Carney said. On the same day Obama talked with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry consulted allies and indicated potentially imminent action by a coalition likely to include key NATO partners and regional powers. Cameron is proposing a U.N. Security Council resolution ""condemning the chemical weapons attack by Assad and authorizing necessary measures to protect civilians,"" but certain opposition by Syrian ally Russia and possibly by China doomed its chances. Instead, a limited coalition of NATO partners and some Arab League members appeared more likely to provide political backing for Obama to order U.S. missile strikes. An Arab League spokesman condemned the al-Assad regime on Tuesday for the chemical attack. In another move, the United States postponed its involvement in talks scheduled for this week in Geneva on seeking a political solution to the Syrian civil war. Russia expressed disappointment at the U.S. decision and warned against any Western military strike on Syria, as did Iran. The United States has already moved warships armed with cruise missiles into the region, and a U.S. official said Wednesday that two Navy submarines also were in the eastern Mediterranean, though it was unclear whether they would be involved in any military action. Hagel told the BBC on Tuesday that forces were ready to carry out a strike if ordered. A senior Defense Department official told CNN that any strike could be completed ""within several days."" ""We are ready to go, like that,"" said Hagel, adding that ""the options are there, the United States Department of Defense is ready to carry out those options."" Opinion: How Al-Assad used chemical weapons to poison debate . For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in Syria's civil war, only escalating aid to rebel fighters in June after suspected smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces. However, last week's attack obliterated the ""red line"" Obama set just over a year ago against the use of Syria's chemical weapons stocks. Vice President Joe Biden made clear that the administration's view of who was to blame for last week's event, telling the American Legion on Tuesday that ""there is no doubt who is responsible for the heinous use of chemical weapons -- the Syrian regime."" The White House has ruled out sending ground troops to Syria or implementing a no-fly zone to blunt al-Assad's aerial superiority over rebels fighting to oust his regime. A first step to any U.S. action will be the public release of a declassified U.S. intelligence report on the chemical weapons that  rebels claim killed 1,300 people. Carney said the report was expected to come out this week. It would set in motion the process that could lead to missile strikes or other responses, depending on the administration's ability to line up international support and prevent any domestic obstacles. Legislator: Congress can't 'be pushed aside' Administration officials will brief some senators on Syria via conference calls Thursday, several sources said. More than 90 members of Congress, most of them Republican, have signed a letter to the president urging him ""to consult and receive authorization"" before authorizing any such military action, according to the office of GOP Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia. ""I appreciate and respect that the president is engaging members of Congress,"" Rigell said Wednesday in reference to outreach by administration officials to legislative leaders and others. ""This is good, and I encourage more of it, both on the Senate side and the House.  But it is not in any respect a substitute for formally calling us into session, a joint session, laying the facts before us without disclosing of course sources and methods of intelligence. Then we, as the representatives of the American people, can weigh in on this as we should."" However, Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington said that ""the historical precedence is no, that the president doesn't require congressional action for a variety of different things."" Some Republican senators also noted that the War Powers Act allows Obama to order limited missile strikes and report back to Congress afterward. Last month, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey provided Congress with a list of declassified U.S. military options for Syria that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to ""an act of war"" at a time of deep budget cuts.

"China has warned the United States to end its military surveillance flights near Chinese territory, rejecting claims by Washington that a Chinese fighter jet made several ""dangerous"" and ""unprofessional"" passes at a U.S. Navy plane last week. The U.S. should take ""concrete measures"" towards ending reconnaissance operations off the coast of China if it wants to improve bilateral ties between the two countries, a spokesperson for China's Defense Ministry, Yang Yujun, said at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Thursday. On August 19, a Chinese fighter jet intercepted a U.S. Navy Poseidon patrol plane in the South China Sea about 135 miles east of the Chinese island of Hainan, coming as close as 20 feet at one point, according to the Pentagon. The armed Chinese aircraft crossed close beneath the P-8 Poseidon three times, according to U.S. Defense Department spokesman Rear. Adm. John Kirby, who described the maneuvers as ""pretty aggressive, very unprofessional."" It was the fourth such incident this year, according to the Pentagon. China pilot 'professional' Yang dismissed the claims Thursday, saying that the pilot had been ""professional"" and that ""due regard"" had been given to safety. He accused the U.S. of focusing on the distance between the aircraft during the encounter while ignoring the fact that its military had been conducting frequent surveillance missions against China, which he said was a policy issue. ""On the one hand, the U.S. expressed their willingness to deepen a military-to-military relationship with China, but on the other hand, they are reluctant to give up these frequent close-in reconnaissance activities against China,"" Yang said. U.S. military ships and aircraft have long been conducting ""wide-ranging"" surveillance activities near China, undermining Beijing's security interests and damaging bilateral ties between the two countries, Yang said, warning that the missions could lead to ""undesirable incidents."" Yang accused the United States of spying on Chinese military exercises, trainings and weapons tests in the air and at sea. ""These behaviors of U.S. military ships and aircraft could easily cause misperception and miscalculation or even air and sea accidents. Therefore we do urge the U.S. side to decrease these close-in reconnaissance activities against China towards a complete stop."" He said China had expressed its concerns to the United States through multiple channels, including diplomacy. Asked how China would respond if the United States failed to end its surveillance operations, Yang said the Chinese military's future missions would be decided based on ""various factors,"" without elaborating further. Yang dismissed claims by State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki Monday that U.S. surveillance activities are conducted in a transparent manner and that other countries, including China are made aware of Washington's plans. ""There has not been any notification to the Chinese side,"" he said. Past encounters . In April 2001, a Chinese fighter jet and a U.S. patrol plane carrying a crew of 24 collided off Hainan, forcing the U.S. craft to make an emergency landing on the island. Blaming the United States for the incident, Chinese officials said their J-8 fighter crashed into the South China Sea -- killing the pilot. The United States called for the immediate return of the high-tech EP-3 aircraft and the crew. The crew were allowed to return to the United States 11 days after the collision, and the dismantled spy plane was flown home some weeks later. The United States conducts around 500 reconnaissance missions near China each year, according to Chinese military analyst Zhang Junshe. China wary of Japan defense plans .

"Near Debaltseve, Ukraine (CNN)In driving snow and frigid temperatures, one Ukrainian fighter on a tank leaving the besieged town of Debaltseve described it as ""a one-way street to the grave."" The surrounding roads are littered with the wreckage of what were once Ukrainian military positions, an obliterated checkpoint, the remains of people in an armed personnel carrier hit by an explosion. Inside the once bustling town, the icy, devastated, streets are empty. The few civilians too old or sick to flee cower indoors desperately, hoping not to be killed by the near-constant shelling. Destruction doesn't discriminate, and nurseries have been hit by shells as well as City Hall, devastating the city's infrastructure. This small transport hub in eastern Ukraine has become a focus for bitter violence between Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists following a ceasefire agreement four days ago that has faltered. Most of Ukraine's armed forces have been pulled out of the strategic railroad town following weeks of fierce gunbattles and street fights, according to its military, while one rebel leader claimed that separatists had taken over 80% of the town. Separatists claimed to have 60 Ukrainian prisoners of war, although CNN cannot independently verify those claims. If you hadn't heard of Debaltseve before today, it's not surprising. It was a small, nondescript Soviet-era town, which had a population of just 25,000 before fighting started. So why exactly has it become a key focus for violence? Strategic hub . For one thing, Debaltseve is a vital rail transport hub for the pro-Russian rebels. It is the site of strategic rail and highway junctions that connect rebel-held strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk, which is near the Russian border. Part of infrastructure built in the Soviet era when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, Debaltseve is key for transporting coal, steel and supporting other heavy industries in the region. Debaltseve's rail hub is one of three crucial positions -- the other two being Donetsk international airport and the industrial port of Mariupol -- which, if caught, would be ideal for Russia to open a land corridor to recently annexed Crimea, according to The Jamestown Foundation. Ceasefire misfire? Debaltseve, at that time held by Ukrainian forces but encircled by separatists, was not specifically addressed in the ceasefire agreement. It was always an issue of contention: Separatists believed it was theirs under the recent Minsk agreement. ""The separatists took it as carte blanche that the city was theirs,"" reports CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. Geographically, it was a little bit of Ukraine-controlled land that stuck up into separatist-controlled areas that they wanted, he said. ""It was always within their territory because they'd encircled it, (the separatists contended),"" Paton Walsh said. ""Although that's not the way the West or Kiev perceived it."" Civilian toll . Fighting in the city -- which a spokesman for the Ukrainian government's military operation, Sladislav Seleznyov, last week described as the most dangerous place in the country -- has taken a huge toll on the civilian population. Only 3,000-4,000 of Debaltseve's former population of 25,000 remain. Outside the city, near the village of Ugelgorsk, separatist shells rocked the farmland -- fired from an SA13 Gopher Air Defense System, according to experts Jane's -- more evidence of the kind of modern firepower in separatist hands. Civilians have been caught in the crossfire between artillery coming from rebels on one side and the Ukrainian army on the other -- and have literally had nowhere to run. Many have been trying to find shelter from the violence underground, living in basements. A local resident, Antonina, bundled against the cold in a red coat and woolen headscarf, wept as she described how her husband Yevgeny was killed in November about a week before he turned 65. ""He said, 'Run! Get down in the basement.' But he stayed up here and the shell hit. He lived for a moment, but he died just here. And it tore up everything. How can we live?"" CNN's Jessica King in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Debaltseve, a small town in eastern Ukraine, has been a focus for violence .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The death toll from recent eruptions of Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano has climbed to 273, government officials said Wednesday. The toll keeps rising as rescuers search for victims of the volcano, which started its recent eruptions on October 26. The government's volcano alert level remains at its highest level, though officials said last week that the worst might be over. The recent eruptions displaced nearly 400,000 people, according to the Disaster Management Agency. On Wednesday, 300,957 people remained in temporary shelters. Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is on the island of Java. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called the volcanic eruptions a crisis situation. He and several ministers have visited the area and taken part in relief efforts. The volcano has a summit elevation of almost 3,000 meters (10,000 feet). It is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. Many people raise crops and livestock in its shadow. Yudhoyono has announced that residents will receive compensation for livelihoods and animals lost to the eruptions. The government will buy endangered cows on the volcano, the president said. Many of those who live on its slopes risked their lives by staying or returning to feed their cows during lulls in the volcanic activity. About 1,300 people died when the volcano erupted in 1930. CNN's Andy Saputra and Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","The toll keeps rising as rescuers search for victims .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Saturday asked Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, according to two White House officials. Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius walks with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal after meeting with the president this week. The officials told CNN that Obama is expected to make the announcement Monday afternoon. The officials asked not to be named because the announcement has not yet been made. Sebelius, who administration officials say Obama seriously considered to be his vice-presidential nominee, has been rumored to be a top contender for the job for weeks. The post is still vacant after the first pick, former Sen. Tom Daschle, stepped aside after questions were raised about his failure to pay more than $100,000 in taxes for use of a car and driver. CNN reported earlier this month that Sebelius met in Washington with senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett about the job, a sign that the administration has been giving her a close look since Daschle dropped out. The officials noted Sebelius has a good personal relationship with Obama and remained in the running for the vice presidential slot until near the end of the process. She was also considered for other Cabinet posts.","White House officials: Obama asks Kansas governor to be HHS secretary .

"London (CNN) -- For months, the West has struggled to take a strong stand against Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. And while Europe's leaders are acutely aware of the threat to peace on their Eastern flank, the countries with the most at stake have, time after time, seemed unable to present a united and resolute front. But the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 has become a game changer -- a watershed moment which most concede would be too dangerous to let go. And now, as Europe prepares to finally take decisive steps, its chiefs will have to recognize that, if they are to be effective, they will also have to hurt their economies. As a block, the European Union exports about 100 billion euros worth of goods and services to Russia and takes in roughly 200 billion euros of the latter's imports. That is money that matters, for sure, but it's not Russia's role as a consumer that would affect Europe most. Rather, it's Russia's function as a major supplier of energy. Should Russia cut its gas to the West in response, the loss in European production would more damaging than the hit its trade balance would take. Just as the region is trying its best to revive a stagnant economy, attempting to mend a fragile debt market and tackle high unemployment, alienating a major trading partner next door is a risk Europe's ministers are understandably loath to take. And some countries have more to lose than others. With its billion dollar contracts for Mistral warships -- a deal which keeps some 1,000 Frenchmen and women employed in a country with a 10% unemployment rate -- France is Europe's largest supplier of arms to Russia. The UK also provides more minor military hardware and sells cars to Russia. With its own gas fields in the North Sea and the potential in future years to harness its shale oil, the UK does have other energy options. However if the EU hits Russian state-owned banks, London's financial center would suffer while its luxurious residences in the capital would also become less appealing to the swathe of oligarchs who have relocated to Britain of late. For Germany, curtailed trade with Russia could really bite. And considering as the former is Europe's biggest economy the implications would be felt well beyond its borders. More than 6,000 German firms operate in Russia, pouring in billions of dollars in foreign direct investment. Some 300,000 German workers depend on their country's trade with Russia for their livelihoods. Sectors like the automotive industry, defense and engineering which have haemorrhaged jobs since the 2008 crisis would be hit hard once again. So, are such sanctions really worth it and would they work? To answer this question it depends on what Europe hopes to achieve. Russia's economy was already headed for a recession before Europe and the U.S. started talking tough. Some $90 billion of capital is likely to flee its markets this year, according to the conservative estimates of Russia's central bank which was forced to pull a recent bond auction due to unfavorable market conditions. By tightening the noose over Russia's banks, Europe hopes not only to turn the country's key industrialists away from president Putin but also to limit the Kremlin's ability to fund its banks on the international markets, meaning Russia would have to dig deep into its currency reserves and undermine the value of the Ruble -- a currency which has up until now been surprisingly unruffled. In the longer term -- say in three to five years-- bans on equipment and so-called sensitive technologies to the energy sector could hamper Russian plans to further exploit its massive oil and gas reserves. Presumably the EU hopes that for everyone's sake the crisis surrounding Ukraine will be solved by then. But in the meantime, if the EU intends to send the strong message it needs, its leaders must reconcile their wish to make a point with the potential to lose a few points off of their GDP.

"A student opening fire with a handgun he took from his parents. Screaming students running for cover. A teacher, trying to help, shot dead. Two students wounded. The terror lasted just a few brutal minutes. As authorities investigated, details were still trickling out hours after a deadly shooting Monday at a Nevada middle school. One official described the scene at Sparks Middle School with one word: chaos. Students described to CNN how they ran into the school screaming and crying when they realized the pops they heard were gunshots just before the morning bell welcomed them back from fall break. The shooter took a handgun from his parents, a federal law enforcement source who was briefed on the situation told CNN's Evan Perez. The gunman eventually shot and killed himself with the semiautomatic gun, Sparks Deputy Chief Tom Miller said Monday evening at a news conference. Teachers train to face school shooter . Authorities said the shooter's motive was unclear. ""It's too early to say whether he was targeting specific people or just going on an indiscriminate shooting spree,"" said Tom Robinson, deputy chief of the Reno Police Department. Teacher loved his kids, brother says . Mike Landsberry, a popular math teacher at the school, was killed in the shooting, Sparks Mayor Geno Martini told CNN. In addition to his work as a teacher, Landsberry also had served in the Marines and served several tours in Afghanistan as a member of the Nevada Air National Guard, his brother, Reggie, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""He was the kind of person that if someone needed help he would be there,"" Reggie Landsberry said. ""He loved teaching. He loved the kids. He loved coaching them. ... He was just a good all-around individual."" Reggie Landsberry said his brother was probably trying to ""talk the kid down and protect whoever he could. That sounds like Mike."" One student told ""Pier Morgan Live"" that she knew the student who shot Landsberry and wounded two 12-year-old schoolmates. ""He was really a nice kid,"" Amaya Newton told CNN. ""He would make you smile when you were having bad day."" He even offered to buy other students something to cheer them up, Newton said. Newton said she thought the two students who were wounded were friends of the shooter. She and her mother, Tabatha, said they thought the shooter had been bullied in the past. Student Faith Robinson said she was standing to the side of one of the school buildings where she heard shots and saw Landsberry killed. She told CNN that she ran into the school and was separated from her friends. ""I start getting really worried and then I was trying to get a hold of my Mom,"" she said. Terra Robinson was just a few minutes away when she got her daughter's distressing call. By the time she got to the school there was a sea of flashing lights and panicked parents, she said. The superintendent of Washoe County Schools said there were many heroes. ""Including our children who, even though school hadn't started, when the teachers came out, they listened to them and they went into their classrooms immediately,"" Pedro Martinez said. Witness: Teacher tried to get student to put gun down . Student Thomas Wing said he was walking out of the cafeteria after eating breakfast when he saw a gun. He told CNN affiliate KOLO that Landsberry was trying to get the student to put the weapon down. After a gunshot, Thomas started running back toward the cafeteria. He heard another shot. ""I was thinking, oh my gosh, am I going to get out of this? Am I going to die?"" he told KOLO. ""My heart was pounding faster than I could run."" An emergency dispatch calls released by the Sparks police department indicate Landsberry was shot on the school playground. One wounded student was shot in the stomach, and the other injured student was shot in the shoulder, Washoe County School District Police Chief Mike Mieras said. The two 12-year-old boys were both in stable condition Monday night, Miller said. Does your child's school have a security plan? Authorities said that first responders were at the school just three minutes after the initial 911 calls. ""I think we were well-prepared. Everybody responded appropriately. I think our first responders did a heckuva job, but it's a sad day for the city of Sparks,"" Mayor Martini told CNN. Shooting began early Monday morning . City officials said authorities received emergency calls from students and staff at the school about 7:15 a.m. about an active shooter on campus. Guns, guards and posses: Schools try new security strategies . Authorities said students were taken to a nearby high school to meet their parents. School was canceled for the week at Sparks Middle School and for the day at nearby Agnes Risley Elementary, officials said. ""I was deeply saddened to learn of the horrific shooting at Sparks Middle School this morning,"" Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said in a statement. ""My administration is receiving regular updates and the Nevada Highway Patrol is assisting at the scene. Kathleen and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims and those affected by these tragic events."" The shooting is one of several this year at a U.S. middle or high school. Last week a student at a high school in Austin, Texas, killed himself in front of other students. In August, a student at a high school in Winston-Salem, North Carolina,  shot and wounded another student in the neck. Another shooting occurred at an Atlanta middle school in January, the same month a California high school student wounded two people, one seriously. The Nevada shooting also comes almost a year after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, igniting nationwide debate over gun violence and school safety. The mother of a student killed in December's shooting in Newtown said Monday's shooting was reminder of the need to find solutions to keep students safe. ""The unthinkable has happened yet again, this time in Sparks, Nevada,"" Nicole Hockley said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the children of Sparks Middle School, who today came face to face with violence that no child should ever experience. It's moments like this that demand that we unite as parents to find common sense solutions that keep our children -- all children -- safe, and prevent these tragedies from happening again and again.""

"""Awesome!"" exclaimed Sister Benedykta Mazur, as she described Wadowice's new museum dedicated to its revered hometown boy, Pope John Paul II. His enthusiasm for his faith and his country radiates through this rural town in southern Poland. And in the spring sunshine Sister Benedykta reminds me of how and why Poland has defied historical odds and emerged as a stable, dynamic country in the heart of Europe. Sister Benedykta tells me Pope John Paul II made patriotism part and parcel of the fourth commandment, honor and love thy parents.  She says the pope encouraged Polish people to love their country and believe in its potential. There is much debate both inside and outside Poland on whether the pope's influence was ever political or revolutionary. But listening to Sister Benedykta, the debate softens and blurs and what emerges is pure gratitude. Many people here say they are thankful history bestowed them a Polish pope that embodied their aspirations. A quarter century ago, the Solidarity movement led a bold, brave path to independence and yet it was a movement so nuanced and profound, it's perhaps better appreciated with hindsight. Or maybe on a stroll through the main square in Wadowice. The square has been rebuilt, the church where the pope worshipped has been restored and renewed. A papal museum dedicated to the life of Pope John Paul II sits prominently on the square, packed with visitors from all over the world. We speak with Polish families on a Sunday stroll, Irish tourists on a pilgrimage to the former pope's homeland and tourists from the Philippines eager to learn more about the pope's early life. All comment on Poland's independence and prosperity and how Pope John Paul II seems still to be the guardian of their freedom. With one of the fastest growing economies in Europe, a stable democracy and a dynamic workforce, Poland has indeed made revolution look easy, even inevitable. But the chaotic and violent revolutions around the world in recent years are a reminder of how difficult political change can be and why Poland's has been so extraordinary. To be sure, Poland has been guided by the steady hand of European Union and more importantly, its economic aid. But it's the voices of Solidarity leaders 25 years ago that still resonate. Pope John Paul II was not always vocal or strident about the situation in Poland or how it should change, but his return to his homeland in 1979 as pope seemed to summon the confidence Polish people always knew they had. Even those not yet born in 1979 tell us his visit was a catalyst giving Poland the courage and faith to push ahead with its protest and the peoples' demand for freedom and independence. All these details have been written and rewritten in modern history countless times, but it is on our visit to Poland that we really saw their significance. In Wadowice's sunny square, in Gdansk's modern football stadium, in Warsaw's renewed skyline, we have found an emboldened country humbled by its historical leaders and thankful for the future they've inspired.

"(CNN)  -- Honduran authorities on Monday clashed with supporters of deposed President Jose Manuel Zelaya, but the extent of the unrest appeared limited. Zelaya supporters burn tires Monday near the presidential palace in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. The Telesur TV network showed soldiers advancing on some streets of the capital, Tegucigalpa, and blue-helmeted police clashing with noisy demonstrators, one day after military troops detained Zelaya and sent him into exile. Other images showed troops, tanks and other military assets deployed around the presidential grounds. The station, a conglomerate formed by several Latin American governments and partially funded by the pro-Zelaya Venezuelan government, also aired images of demonstrators setting fires in the streets. Gauging the size and scope of the demonstrations and clashes was difficult because of limitations that journalists reported. Adriana Sivori, a reporter for Telesur, reported that she and other journalists were briefly detained and mistreated by Honduran soldiers. She was live on television as she described the troops transporting them at gunpoint. Two national television stations were taken off the air following Sunday's military-led coup, and a third station told CNN en Español that its content was being limited by authorities. CNN en Español correspondent Krupskaia Alis, who witnessed Monday's protests, said the demonstrators numbered in the hundreds. At least 15 were injured Monday, the newspaper La Prensa reported. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your photos, videos . The military deposed Zelaya early Sunday and flew him to Costa Rica. Roberto Micheletti, president of the Congress, was sworn in as provisional president. Zelaya had been at odds with the other branches of government over a referendum he wanted to hold Sunday. The nation's Supreme Court ruled the referendum was illegal and Congress voted not to hold it. The Supreme Court also overturned Zelaya's dismissal of Honduras' top general, who said the military would not participate in the referendum. The court ordered he general be reinstated immediately. Zelaya disregarded those actions and vowed to hold the vote Sunday anyway.  Watch details on ""curious situation"" in Honduras » . On Monday, Micheletti began to build his provisional government. He named seven new members to his cabinet, which he said will be in place until the planned presidential elections slated for November of this year. Micheletti, formerly the president of Congress, has said the change in power was not a coup, but a democratic process that saw the ousting of a president who had exceeded his power. The Honduran Supreme Court said after the coup that it had authorized the military action. The United States and most Latin American nations have condemned the coup, the first in Latin America since the end of the Cold War. While military interventions were once routine in Latin America, civilian governments have held sway across the region since the 1980s, and previously all-powerful militaries have receded into the background. ""That history is a thing of the past, and it should be buried so that it never happens again,"" Jorge Arturo Reina, Honduras' ambassador to the U.N. told CNN en Español, following a meeting of the General Assembly to address the issue. The head of the Organization of American States also condemned the coup. President Obama on Monday called the turmoil in Honduras a step backward from the ""enormous progress of the last 20 years in establishing democratic traditions in Latin America.""  Watch what Obama has to say about the coup » . ""We believe that the coup was not legal and that President Zelaya remains the president of Honduras,"" Obama said. Though deposed, Zelaya continued to carry out his presidential duties, attending a special meeting of the leftist group ALBA, the Spanish acronym for Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas, in Nicaragua. ALBA, founded by Cuba and Venezuela in 2004 to counter U.S. influence in Latin America, said member nations would withdraw ambassadors and top diplomats from Honduras until Zelaya is restored to power. Zelaya is expected to travel to the United Nations on Tuesday. Despite widespread condemnation for the coup, analysts see plenty of blame to go around -- and no easy solution. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your photos, videos . ""There are no heroes in this story,"" said Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs. ""These people are caricatures of rectitude rather than examples of it."" The Honduran Supreme Court, he said, is ""one of the most corrupt institutions in Latin America."" And Zelaya overplayed his hand, Birns and others said. ""Zelaya was part of the problem,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute. ""He's partly responsible for what happened. He was pushing too hard on a very fragile political institution. He was just plowing ahead against the wishes of every political institution, including his own political party."" Zelaya's removal also raises larger issues for many fragile Latin American democracies. ""What happens when the Supreme Court decides against the president and the president ignores it? Who enforces it?"" asked Robert Pastor, a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. What happens next is clearly unknown. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that an OAS delegation would travel to Honduras as early as Tuesday to begin working on restoring a constitutional government. That might not be an easy task. ""According to mainstream Honduran media sources, Zelaya's removal has the widespread support of the political and business elite and the military, and it appears doubtful that he will be able to return to power,"" said Heather Berkman, an analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm. ""An exit strategy is needed,"" Birns said. ""But it's going to be extremely difficult to come out with an exit strategy unless they get consent of key players like the national legislature."" Pastor holds out some hope. ""I don't think it's impossible,"" he said. Said Hakim: ""You can never put the toothpaste back in the tube. But you can provide a peaceful transition process.""

"There are 34 years of reasons to be skeptical about any negotiations that may emerge from Friday's historic phone call between President Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.  There are scores of broken promises and outright lies about Iran's nuclear program itself.  There is Iran's state sponsorship of terror and its efforts to extend its influence across the Middle East at the expense of peace, human dignity and America's allies. But there are no reasons not to be appreciative of the significance of the call, the courage it took for President Obama to seek it, or the good common sense that is to be associated with the United States talking to its enemies. Earlier this week, a flurry of speculation surrounded a possible meeting between Obama and Rouhani on the edges of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York.  During a session with U.S. media that I attended, Rouhani said a handshake between the two leaders did not take place because the Iranians did not want the gesture without a plan for following up on it. He said the White House had proposed the meeting but Iran declined simply because there was not enough time to prepare such a plan, and added that he welcomed better communication with the United States. Frankly, I was skeptical. But then, after two days of exchanges, the two countries hammered out a preliminary plan.  With that in place, the historic exchange, the first by leaders of the two countries since 1979, took place.  Both agreed to instruct representatives to begin negotiations toward an agreement regarding Iran's nuclear program.  The United States seeks to ensure the program does not lead to Iran's development of nuclear weapons.  Iran, according to Rouhani, seeks to have the ability to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear power and nothing more. There have been negotiations in other forums in the past. Officials here and abroad have long asserted that Iran has been trying to move closer to the capability to develop nuclear weapons, despite years of passionate denials by its leaders. President Obama has said he would use whatever means necessary to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. America's closest ally in the region, Israel, has declared Iran's pursuit of such weapons an existential threat.  Iran's neighbors in the Gulf have watched its programs warily and offered telling indications that a nuclear Iran would trigger a nuclear arms race in the region. President Obama came into office citing this as a top national security concern.  Even as other U.S. policy initiatives in the region have met with mixed success, he and his team stepped up a sanctions program that squeezed the Iranian economy hard, contributing to a national economic crisis in that country. It was one of the things President Rouhani was elected to help fix.  (Of course, the choice of who could run in that election and what he could then do once in office was ultimately determined by that country's ruling clerics, most notably, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.) Whether there was a benefit to be had from direct contact between Iran's president and America's  was raised as early as the 2008 presidential campaign.  Strong voices in both U.S. political parties counseled against such exchanges.  Obama argued as president-elect that there was merit to more rather than less interaction, telling ABC's George Stephanopoulos  in January 2009, ""We are going to have to take a new approach (regarding Iran). And I've outlined my belief that engagement is the place to start."" Since then, having overseen America's withdrawal from Iraq, having set a date for withdrawal from Afghanistan, and having appeared hesitant to aggressively engage in crises from Egypt to Syria, Obama has found himself using ""engagement"" in a different, more defensive sense. Critics, including myself, have argued he appears to be leaning away from the region and its myriad, complex problems.  This week at the United Nations he said, ""The danger for the world is that the United States, after a decade of war, rightly concerned about issues back home, and aware of the hostility that our engagement in the region has engendered throughout the Muslim world, may disengage.  I believe that would be a mistake."" Now, it seems, at a time when the president has seen his foreign policy approval numbers hit new lows, he has reverted to his old idea of actively speaking to our enemies as the best way to prove he is not turning away from the region.  He has collaborated with circumstances to choose this option in Syria--and Iran. It is risky.  Both situations defy easy solution.  The Iranians have changed their tone but must go a long way to prove they are changing their intent, embracing transparency and adhering to international standards.   Even if they do, if they continue to support terrorist groups like Hezbollah they will be at loggerheads with the United States. But as Winston Churchill said, ""To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war."" If talks come with the skepticism they deserve--and a tough timeline that doesn't let Iran use them as a stalling tactic to further develop weapons programs--they are a risk well worth taking.   And they may just demonstrate that the best adviser of the new Obama is the old Obama.","David Rothkopf: Call with Iran's Rouhani historic, significant, and courageous for Obama .

"Didier Drogba, the man who secured Chelsea's first ever European Champions League triumph, leads the nominations for Africa's Player of the Year award. The striker's winning penalty in a dramatic shootout against German giants Bayern Munich was his last strike of the ball for the English club, with whom he spent eight seasons. Drogba, who is a huge star back in the Ivory Coast and is credited with a pivotal role in ending the country's civil war, now plays for Shanghai Shenhua in China. Also on the list is Christopher Katongo, who led Zambia to a maiden Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) victory earlier in 2012, as they beat Drogba's Ivory Coast in the final. The minnows stunned the continent as they triumphed at the finals, hosted by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and Katongo was named player of the tournament. Like Drogba, the 30-year-old plays in China, for Henan Construction, and has scored 19 goals in 74 appearances for Zambia, as he helped his country ensure they will defend their trophy in 2013 in South Africa. There are a quartet of English based players on the list, with Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure, an Ivory Coast teammate of Drogba, prominent among them. Toure, alongside brother Kolo, helped City claim their first English league title in 44 years in a thrilling end to the 2011/12 campaign and was named in the Premier League team of the season. Senegalese striker Demba Ba has become a firm fans' favorite at Newcastle United, scoring 23 goals in his 44 Premier League appearances so far. Like Drogba, Nigeria's Jon Obi Mikel was part of Chelsea's squad which won the Champions League and also England's premier domestic cup competition, the FA Cup. Arsenal's Gervinho was also on the losing side in the CAN final, after his goal helped Ivory Coast beat Mali in the last four. New Barcelona signing Alex Song has also made the cut. After an impressive season with Arsenal the defensive midfielder earned a high-profile move to the Spanish giants prior to the start of the 2012/13 season. There is a place on the list for Marseille's Ghanaian winger Andre Ayew, who helped take his country to the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2012. Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is another French-based player to earn a nomination, after finishing as joint top scorer at the CAN with three goals. The final name is Morocco's Younes Belhanda, who scored 13 times as his club side Montpellier won the French league title. The 22-year-old was named in the French league's team of the season and was crowned young player of the year. African soccer's governing body, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), has also announced five candidates for their Africa-based Player of the Year Award. There are two players who represent DR Congo club TP Mazembe -- Rainford Kalaba and Stoppila Sunzu -- Egyptian midfielder Mohamed Aboutreika, who plays in his native country for Al-Ahly, and Yannick N'Djeng and Yousse Msakni who both play for Tunisian club Esperance Sportive de Tunis.","Dider Drogba leads 10-strong field nominated for African Player of the Year award .

"On Wednesday, the Massachusetts Supreme Court issued an opinion in the matter of Commonwealth v. Michael Robertson, holding that it is not illegal to secretly photograph underneath a person's skirt on the subway, a practice widely known as ""upskirting."" The court, and the justice who wrote the opinion, have since weathered harsh -- and undeserved -- criticism.  On Thursday, state lawmakers passed a bill banning upskirting, but that new law—which yet to be signed by the governor-- will still be subject to the same judicial scrutiny if it fails to adequately define the crime and the elements thereof. No one, including the members of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, condones upskirting. But the court is not in the business of ""condoning"" activity, nor is it in a position to adjudicate the fairness of the outcome.  The court is in the very limited business of applying the law enacted by the legislatures, and it did just that.  In fact, it carefully applied the definitions provided by both the Legislature and Webster's dictionary.  The problem isn't the justice; it's the statute, as wrtitten,  itself. General Laws c. 272, § 105(b) provides: . ""Whoever willfully photographs, videotapes or electronically surveils another person who is nude or partially nude, with the intent to secretly conduct or hide such activity, when the other person in such place and circumstance would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being so photographed, videotaped or electronically surveilled, and without that person's knowledge and consent, shall be (guilty and punished)."" The Court recognized that the statute, as written, breaks down into five elements: 1. The defendant willfully photographed. 2. The victim was nude or partially nude. 3. The defendant intended to photograph surreptitiously. 4. The victim was in a place where she would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being ""so photographed."" 5. The absence of consent. The only elements really in dispute were Nos. 2 and 4. The defendant's argument was that, under the statute, the female passenger was not ""nude or partially nude,"" nor was she in a place where she had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The Commonwealth had to prove both of these for a conviction, along with the other elements. The failure of any one of these elements meant the failure of them all. Let's break this down. Partial nudity . First, consider the legal definition of ""partially nude."" Most of our personal definitions of partial nudity were formed by vague warnings from opening credits on Cinemax movies in the 1990s.  But ""partial nudity"" is actually a legal concept, with a legal definition. The law defines it as ""the exposure of the human genitals, buttocks, pubic area or female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola."" Unfortunately, the statute, as written, ded not provide a definition of ""exposure,"" so the court properly turned to Webster's dictionary, which defines it as ""a condition or instance of being laid bare or exposed to view."" To the court, ""partially nude"" means having private parts that are uncovered and visible to another person's eyes.  ""A person who is ... partially nude,"" according to the court, is a person who is partially clothed but whose private parts are exposed in plain view when photographed.  It appears from the court's opinion that ""partially nude"" is not to be confused with ""almost nude,"" as one might be if one's private parts are covered but she or he is wearing only underwear.  Who knew nudity was so complicated? What happened to ""I know it when I see it?"" Apparently, that phrase works for defining pornography, but when it comes to nudity, the court is a bit of a stickler.  In Massachusetts, it appears that a ""female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is 'partially nude,' no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing."" Reasonable expectation of privacy . The court went on to discuss the fourth statutory element: whether the victims were ""in such place and circumstance (where the person) would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being so photographed."" To the court, because the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority is a public transit system operating in a public place that uses cameras, the two alleged victims -- and all female straphangers -- were not in a place where they reasonably would or could have had an expectation of privacy. The prosecution valiantly argued that privacy is less about the location where the photographing occurs than the location on the body photographed.  The court dismissed this argument.  While on the subway, a woman has a diminished expectation of privacy; she wears a skirt at her own risk. Though reasonable minds can definitely disagree about where we have ""reasonable"" expectations of privacy, for purposes of this case, it's immaterial.  The way the statute was written, the defendant was ""not guilty"" the moment any one of the statutory elements failed.  This case was over at ""partial nudity."" The opinion raises privacy issues unique to female clothing -- and, in particular, the skirt.  It's a garment that from 90% of vantage points completely conceals undergarments.  It's the other 10% that is problematic; sit or stand in the wrong place or position, and undergarments are now visible. Even more problematic, if a defendant photographs a woman at the beach in a bikini, she is neither partially nude nor does she have an expectation of privacy.  But if she then puts on a sarong and hops on a bus, should it be illegal to photograph up her skirt?  This definitely feels like a moral invasion of privacy, but under statutes like the one here, it might not be an illegal invasion of privacy. Unfortunately for female subway passengers -- and men in kilts -- being upskirted in public by a disturbed person and his camera-phone is still not illegal in Massachusetts.  Under the statute the Court considered, the act neither photographs partial nudity nor violates a reasonable expectation of privacy.  That understandably drew some ire. Indeed, if the law does not change, it represents a harbinger of failed future prosecutions of subway peeping Toms.  But ire at the Massachusetts Supreme Court is misdirected. After all, the justices only interpreted the statute; they didn't write it.","Danny Cevallos: People appalled by Mass. ""upskirt"" ruling, but justices enforcing law as written .
He says victim wasn't partially nude, was in non-private place; law lets photog take picture .
He says opinion raises privacy and moral issues unique to female clothing, mainly skirts .
Cevallos: Don't be angry with court; be angry with legislators who enacted law ."
"(CNN) -- Did you learn anything new in 2014? Of course, your brain is filled with facts about this year's events from the rise of ISIS to the ALS ice bucket challenge. But my question is: Are you saying goodbye to 2014 having learned some new life lessons? I'll give you a moment to think about it. (Cue ""Jeopardy"" music). To be honest, many of the things I learned in 2014 -- as in 2013 -- sucked. And no doubt many of you would agree with me. Here are nine things I wish we hadn't learned in 2014: . 1. A really excited black man is called a ""thug,"" but a white criminal is called Justin Bieber. In January, Seattle Seahawks star Richard Sherman caused a media uproar because of his animated post game interview after his team won the NFC championship. Apparently to some, Sherman was too excited for their liking and they labeled this Stanford University grad a ""thug."" Yet in the same month, Justin Bieber was arrested, accused of drag racing and driving under the influence after admitting to smoking marijuana and taking pills. Later this year, he was ordered to pay $80,900 in restitution for throwing eggs at his former neighbor's home and was placed on probation, with a requirement that he take anger management sessions and perform five days of community labor. If Sherman had done that, what do you think they would have called him? Likely answer: Prisoner number_______. 2. A cantankerous cat earns more money than me (and likely you, too.) Yep, I'm talking ""Grumpy cat."" That grouchy feline's petulant puss is plastered on products from mugs to T-shirts to even a grumpy cat pillowcase for those who want Grumpy's face to be the last they see before they fall asleep and the first thing they see when they wake up. How much did this cat rake in? It's unclear but the cat's manager (and, yes, the cat also has a manager) claimed it was in the seven figures while the cat's owner claimed it was less. In any event, the lesson is if you have choice between getting a really cute cat or one that looks like an angry New Yorker waiting on a long line, pick the latter. 3. Some politicians will even use a deadly disease to score political points. I thought I had seen every way politicians could scare us, but Republicans came up with something new to use in 2014: ebola. While medical professionals were telling us to remain calm, some Republicans were telling us to freak out. One Republican senator even warned of the ""real and present danger"" that ISIS fighters might infect themselves and then infect us. Of course, after Election Day, we didn't hear a peep from these same people about Ebola as it became clear that the risk to the United States was minimal. Can you imagine what they will use in 2015 to scare us? 4. A ""hot"" mug shot can get you not one but two Hollywood agents. You might not recognize the name Jeremy Meeks but you likely recognize his mug shot. He was the guy known as the ""hot convict"" whose photo, taken after he was arrested on gang and weapons related charges, became a viral sensation this spring. Next thing you know, he had a modeling agent and a second agent to help him with endorsements and acting work. The takeaway here is that if you are trying to be discovered, forget acting classes or toiling away in small comedy clubs, just make sure you look ""hot"" when you get arrested. 5. Afghanistan had a higher voter turnout than the United States this year. In April, Afghanistan's presidential election saw about 60% of eligible voters cast a ballot. But in our country, only 36% bothered to vote in November. And keep in mind, people in Afghanistan risked their lives to vote because of threats by the Taliban. In our country, the biggest fear if you voted was missing an episode of ""Dancing With the Stars"" or ""Game of Thrones."" Perhaps we need the people of Afghanistan to make PSA's telling us about the importance of voting? 6. Racial inequities are even worse than many of us suspected. Black teens have a 21 times greater chance of being killed by the police than white teens. In a year marked by controversy over police tactics and race, this report by Pro Publica released this year painfully crystallized the issue. They found, based on the limited data available, that, shockingly, black teenagers are far more likely to be killed by the police than their white counterparts. Pro Publica deserves credit for bringing this finding to light, and we can only hope that it will help spur change in 2015. How do black parents tell their teenagers that simply because of his or her skin color, there's a 21 times greater chance that the police will kill them than their white teenage friends? 7. Kim Kardashian's butt can break the Internet. America seemingly lost its mind over photos of a seminaked (and really naked) Kim Kardashian that were published by Papermag.com. It's as if people didn't realize that the Internet was already filled with naked photos of this famous reality show star. Yet these images were the talk of countless media outlets and drove 4 million people to Papermag.com's website, which was a 2,379% increase over visitors to that website from the month before. On the upside, however, the photos did launch a multitude of hilarious memes including one featuring ""The Family Guy's"" Peter Griffin. 8. The naked selfies I took might be hacked. OK, I don't have any naked selfies. To be honest, I barely can look at photos of myself fully clothed and not be struck with a sense of disappointment. But this year a bevy of celebrities found out that even your most private photos that have been stored in what has been billed as a secure server are not safe. This is just another example of how it appears that we are collectively losing any hope of privacy. 9. The 2016 presidential race could be Clinton versus Bush. With former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently announcing that he was exploring a run for president and almost instantly topping the polls among GOP contenders, and with Hillary Clinton being the presumed Democratic front-runner, we could see a replay of families from the 1992 presidential race in 2016. While they are both solid candidates, I fear a match up between these political ""royal families"" could turn more people off from politics. Can we at least mix it up a little and get a Kennedy or Roosevelt into the race? So that's my list, but what about yours? C'mon, there must be things you wish you hadn't learned in 2014. Tell us about them in the comments section below. And best wishes for a happy and healthy 2015 filled with lessons you are glad you learned.","Dean Obeidallah says 2014 would have been better with less Kardashian, Bieber news .

"(CNN) -- Who is #Falcao? Radamel Falcao Garcia Zarate, Falcao for short, is a Colombian soccer star. He sent Twitter into meltdown on Monday when he joined Manchester United on a one-year loan from Monaco, swapping the French Riviera for a considerably higher tax bill and a city where it rains 53% of the year. Aged 28, he scores goals. Lots of them. During spells with Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco, he's earned a reputation as one of Europe's finest strikers. Monday was European football's ""transfer deadline day,"" the last opportunity for the continent's top teams to sign new players. Imagine NFL draft day, only with no structure and more chaos. Good news for Manchester United, then? Yes and no. Falcao is good enough to improve any team, but United hardly needed another attacking player. Last week it paid Real Madrid nearly $100m to sign Angel di Maria, a forward-thinking addition to a squad that already included the likes of Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata. Throw Falcao into the mix and United manager Louis van Gaal is spoiled for choice at the front of his line-up, but it's at the rear where his team is exposed. United is yet to win this season and recently suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat to third division team MK Dons in the League Cup. Simply put, United signing Falcao is like buying a really nice sweater but forgetting to put on your trousers. Wait, you said Colombia. Where was he at the World Cup? The man nicknamed ""El Tigre"" (The Tiger) missed Colombia's run to the quarterfinals of Brazil 2014 with a knee injury he picked up in January. The whole country was praying their star striker would be fit for selection, so much so that Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos even visited Falcao in hospital, but sadly it wasn't to be. In his absence, James (pronounced ""Ham-ez"") Rodriguez scored six goals as Colombia swaggered its way into the last eight before defeat to hosts Brazil. A new star was born, and Rodriguez is now strutting his stuff at Real Madrid having also left Monaco. Did Falcao not fancy joining ""Ham-ez"" in Madrid? Funny you should mention that. On Saturday a Tweet sent from Falcao's official account said (a rough translation) ""Go Madrid, a dream come true."" But Falcao swiftly denied sending the tweet, saying his profile had been compromised. Pesky hackers... Who is the middle man in the transfer? Uber agent Jorge Mendes, who is seemingly doing his utmost to keep the Portuguese economy afloat. As well as Falcao and Rodriguez, Mendes brokered the deal to bring Di Maria to Old Trafford and Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City. Where can I find his Twitter account? @FALCAO is his official Twitter handle. He's also on Instagram and if you head over there you'll find proof he's also pretty handy with a baseball bat. He's a big guy... Yep, with hair like Samson. But he's spoken for. His wife is Argentinean singer/songwriter Lorelei Taron. His dad Radamel Garcia was also a professional footballer, playing in Colombia, and he thinks his son is going all the way to the top. ""Falcao will lead Monaco to the Champions League,"" said Falcao's entirely impartial father when his son first signed for the French team in 2013. ""Every team he plays for he makes better and he wins a title."" His dad was right. Monaco did qualify for the Champions League, even if Falcao missed most of last season through injury. Now Falcao junior has a similar mission to help United qualify for Europe's top competition. The Manchester club isn't in Europe after an awful season under Alex Ferguson's successor David Moyes, who was subsequently sacked.","Radamel Falcao joins Manchester United on a one-year loan from Monaco .

"(CNN) -- Few 15-year-olds can claim to make history, but Martin Odegaard is fast accumulating a clutch of firsts in football. By coming on as a second half substitute in Norway's clash with Bulgaria on Monday, he became the youngest player ever to appear in European Championships qualifying at just 15 years and 300 days. He is already the youngest player to represent his country -- featuring in a friendly with United Arab Emirates in August -- as well as the youngest player, and scorer, in the country's top league. And Odegaard didn't look out of place during his 27-minute cameo, as Norway beat Bulgaria 2-1 in its Euro 2016 Group H clash. No wonder then, that scouts from clubs all over Europe -- including English Premier League pair Manchester United and Liverpool -- are on the tail of one of the continent's hottest prospects. ""In the beginning it was unreal and a little bit surreal that all these clubs wanted Martin, but it's strange what you can get used to,"" his father Hans Erik Odegaard told CNN last month. ""Almost every top European club has been in touch."" Ex-Norway international Morten Gamst Pedersen has described Odegaard's potential as ""unbelievable,"" while manager Ronny Deila -- who gave the teen his Stromsgodset debut before joining Scottish club Celtic -- says he can ""become the best in the world."" And if the teeanger's ascent in the game carries on at this pace, soon he and his father will have a big decision to make on his future. ""I saw from a very early age that 'he had the feeling,' but I remember very well when I knew he'd be quite good,"" Odegaard's father, a former footballer at Stromsgodset and Sandefjord, added. ""I was still playing and Martin must have been no more than eight. I was out on the pitch running some intervals. He was, as always, with me. When I was finished I wanted to go home, but we couldn't before he had done 50 more shots (at goal). ""Then I understood he also had a talent for training and that is the most important talent you can have."" It is conceivable Odegaard may get to showcase his talents on one of the biggest soccer stages of all given Norway's impressive start to its Euro 2016 campaign. That 2-1 victory, earned thanks to goals from Tarik Elyounossi and Havard Nielsen, put Norway third in its group, behind Croatia, who are top, and Italy. Croatia thrashed Azerbaijan 6-0 while Italy edged past Malta 1-0 thanks to a first senior goal for Graziano Pelle, who plays for Southampton in the English Premier League. Icelandic inspiration . The biggest shock of the night came in Reykjavik where Iceland made it three wins out of three after beating Netherlands 2-0. It is the first time in Iceland's history it has won the opening three matches of a qualifying campaign without conceding a goal. Just like he was in the win over Latvia on Friday, Gylfi Sigurdsson was Iceland's hero, scoring twice in a famous win over a side that finished third at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Sigurdsson, who plays in the English Premier League with Swansea, grabbed his first from the penalty spot after Stefan de Vrij fouled Birkir Bjarnason, firing powerfully past Jasper Cillessen. Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben had a chance to level matters but he wasted a glorious chance, heading wide from a pinpoint Daley Blind cross. And he would be made to pay for that miss as Sigurdsson doubled his account with a fierce volley into the roof of the net following a corner. Netherlands had opportunities in the second half as it pressed to get back in the game but Iceland could have added to its tally on the counter attack. Iceland, who are managed jointly by former Sweden manager Lars LagerbÃ¤ck and Heimir Hallgrisson, are now six points ahead of Netherlands, who are languishing in third. The other clashes in Group A saw the Czech Republic triumph 4-2 in Kazakhstan while Latvia and Turkey drew 1-1 in Riga. Elsewhere, much-fancied Belgium were held to a 1-1 draw with Bosnia in Group B, Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko's opener canceled out by Radja Nainggolan.

"(CNN) -- Champions League holders and arguably Europe's most in-form team Real Madrid were drawn against German side Schalke 04 in the last 16 of Europe's most prestigious competition. Real, which defeated city rival Atletico Madrid 4-1 in Lisbon last year to win ""La Decima"" -- it's 10th title -- is attempting to become the first team to successfully defend the Champions League. Two of England's three clubs face tough ties, with Chelsea drawn against Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City paired with Spanish giants Barcelona. Arsenal were arguably handed an easier route to the quarterfinals after drawing France's Monaco, which will see the London club's manager Arsene Wenger return to the team he coached for seven years between 1987 and 1994. Last season's finalists Atletico will meet Bayer Leverkusen, while Italy's Juventus drew Borussia Dortmund, with Bayern Munich -- Germany's fourth club in the last 16 -- handed a tie against Shakhtar Donetsk. Elsewhere Swiss side Basel will face Portugal's Porto. The 2015 final will be staged in Berlin's Olympiastadion on June 6. The first leg games will be played on February 17/18 and 24/25 , with the second legs scheduled for March 10/11 and 17/18. On Friday Real Madrid extended their winning streak in all competitions to a remarkable 20 games with a 4-1 away win over Almeria.","Real Madrid draw Schalke 04 in last 16 of Champions League .

"(CNN)Openly gay ski legend Anja Paerson says the IOC is out of touch on Lesbian Gay Bisexual and  Transgender (LGBT) issues and that she has little confidence that recent changes to the Olympic Charter will prevent discrimination in the future. Sweden's Paerson, who retired in 2012 after a glittering career which included Olympic gold and seven world championship titles, claims the IOC should have taken a firmer stance in the controversial build-up to 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. Ahead of the Games, LGBT supporters were outraged when the Russian government passed a law in June 2013 prohibiting ""gay propaganda."" The law says it is a crime to publicly acknowledge that you are gay, provide information on homosexuality to minors, or publicly support equal rights for gays. Paerson told CNN's Alpine Edge program that the IOC, which at the time released a statement saying it had ""received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games,"" had effectively ducked the issue. ""The Olympic Committee had a huge responsibility in Sochi and they didn't stand up for human rights,"" she said. ""They were hiding from the difficult questions.  I think at that point they made a lot of wrong choices."" Paerson admitted that she had severe misgivings about going to the Games for her work as a Swedish TV analyst and claimed she was not alone. ""I think a lot of athletes were very uncomfortable. I even figured if I should go or not. ""But I made a choice to go. And I stood for being a gay person and I had my family there, I had my son and my wife. I didn't feel like Russia should choose the way I live."" Paerson also believes that her own sport's ruling body, the International Ski Federation, (FIS) needs to step up to the plate and better support gay athletes. ""Even in alpine skiing I think it's not talked about enough. From the athlete's side I think it's really hard to speak up at the Olympics and I think that's where we have to have changes,"" she added. In the wake of the controversy, the IOC announced earlier this month that it had made an amendment to the Olympic Charter to specifically include the wording ""sexual orientation."" Principle 6 of the Charter now reads: . ""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Olympic Charter shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."" IOC President Thomas Bach of Germany described the change as ""a very important first step"" following a unanimous vote in favor of the move. ""We have to look into the future and try to address the challenges which may arise in the future and the challenges we have already now,"" he added. But Paerson is not convinced this change is sufficient to ensure that future hosts of the Winter Games are held accountable by the IOC for breaches of human rights. ""Hopefully they have learned from Sochi Olympics and will get better in the future,"" she said. Paerson, who was a member of the FIS Athlete Commission, is also calling for her own sport and the IOC to freshen up its membership to better reflect modern views. ""They don't really follow the new developments,"" she believes. ""I hope that both in the Olympic Committee and other sports that the younger generation get more influence because we have a different mindset,"" she added. ""The Games themselves should be open to all, free of discrimination, and that applies to spectators, officials, media, and, of course, athletes,"" said the IOC in statement. ""We oppose in the strongest terms any move that would jeopardize this principle. ""During the Sochi Games IOC President Thomas Bach obtained explicit assurances from the very highest level that there would no discrimination against any participant in the Games and this was fully observed."" The 33-year-old can certainly look back on a stunningly successful career -- a twice winner of coveted overall World Cup title -- in addition to her triumphs at world and Olympic level. But all the while she kept her sexuality a closely guarded secret and it was only on retiring from her sport that she put an end to persistent rumors and revealed that she was gay. In June 2012, a few months after her farewell race, Paerson went on Swedish public radio to announce that she had been in a relationship with her partner Filippa, whom she first met in 2005. ""I never started to believe that I was gay when I was young,"" she told CNN. ""This just happened when I met my wife. She was married and I had a boyfriend. Our lives were just thrown upside down."" The timing of the announcement was a dilemma, Paerson admits and they had been worried about the reaction it would receive. ""We were nervous of course, how people would respond. It was important for us to build our atmosphere, our family, our house, our castle before we let everybody else into our life. ""I think why I didn't choose to announce it when I was still racing was that I wanted to be a hundred per cent focused on my races."" The pair formally tied the knot and were married earlier this year and have a two-year-old son, Elvis. Paerson was trained to her biggest successes by her father Anders, her peak achievement coming in 2007 on the home snow of Are, where she grabbed a stunning three gold medals, a silver and a bronze in the world championships. It came at the end of a difficult season, but after being urged by him to take a short break from training everything clicked into gear. ""I had about 10 days to mentally prepare to believe that my skiing was good enough to win that gold medal. My dad told me 'go home, go to your friends, do whatever for two days and come back'."" When she did, Paerson proved unstoppable across all the disciplines to dominate the competition. Are was the venue for this weekend's World Cup competition, and although retired, Paerson has been taking a keen interest in the proceedings. She has seen compatriot Maria Pietilae-Holmer provide home cheer by taking the slalom title Saturday. Pietilae-Holmer edged out overall World Cup leader Tina Maze of Slovenia by just 0.06secs. Another Swede, Frida Hansdotter, was third 0.32secs off the pace, with Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. back in fourth after a poor first run. The in-form Maze, who had many battles with Paerson's during the Swede's career, won the giant slalom Friday from another home hope hope, Sara Hector.","Sweden's Anja Paerson is a six-time Olympic medalist .

"The Fed Express rolls out of Shanghai with no signs of slowing down yet. Roger Federer beat Frenchman Gilles Simon to win his first Shanghai Masters crown Sunday and his fourth title of the season. The victory will move him above Rafael Nadal, who has been laid low with appendicitis, and up to second in the world rankings. ""Usually everything slows down at the end of the season,"" Federer told reporters in China. ""Not for me this time. ""This year everything is going really well. I have so many highlights to look forward to for the end of the season, which is nice."" With just a handful of events to go until next month's season finale in London, Federer could still mathematically challenge Novak Djokovic to end the year as the world No.1. The 33-year-old Swiss ace beat Djokovic - who arguably inflicted more pain by defeating Federer in the summer's Wimbledon final -- in the semifinals in Shanghai. ""I'm not even going to change my schedule because of it,"" Federer reflected on the possibility of regaining the number one spot. ""I haven't thought about it, to be quite honest. I mean, it's in Novak's racquet. He dictates. ""But nevertheless, I'm still going to be playing and hopefully playing well again."" Federer did not have it easy against Simon, who took the Swiss to a tiebreak in the opening set and had set point at 6-5 up. But the 17-time grand slam champion snuffed out the threat to take the first set breaker 8-6. The match was settled by another tiebreak in the second set which Federer duly closed out more comfortably for a 76 76 victory. There was more good news for Swiss tennis fans as Stan Wawrinka qualified for the World Tour Finals in London.

"(CNN) -- Joe Miller is devouring his second steak of the day and the clock has barely nudged 2pm. Those hefty slabs of meat make up a decent chunk of the 6,000 calories he is putting away daily in what has become an obsessive pursuit of distance. But this intense training regime isn't designed to support a weightlifting crusade or an endurance run, it is built around thrashing a golf ball further than anyone else in the world. ""Joe's obsessed,"" coach Lee Cox says, as his protege chomps down on fillet number two. ""His whole life at the moment is built around finding an extra yard here or there."" If anyone embodies golf's fixation with going further, faster it is Miller. His specially crafted equipment, diet, gym workouts and coaching sessions are all based around him winning a battle of small margins against a legion of monster hitters. The 29-year-old is homing in on his main target for 2014, the long driving world championship in Las Vegas, a title he won back in 2010. Should the man currently ranked No. 1 in the world pitch the ball further than his competitors, prize money of $250,000 will be landing in his bank account. ""It is all-consuming, especially at the moment,"" the 29-year-old told CNN after lunch at Brocket Hall Golf Club, just north of London. ""You're living it, you're thinking about it, you're searching for it. This is the World Championships -- the big one. If you're not going to prepare properly for it, then forget about it."" As I waited for Miller to arrive, the staff had spoken in reverential tones of his hitting prowess. ""Have you seen him swing yet?"" one asked. ""It's ridiculous. Scary."" Miller's longest drive in competition is a mammoth 474 yards. That's the equivalent of hitting the ball ten yards shy of the antenna perched on top of the Empire State Building. It is 50 yards past the longest drive recorded on the PGA Tour in 2014 -- 424 yards by two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson. The speed at which Miller swings the club regularly clocks in at 155 miles per hour and the ball consistently flies off the face at a freakish 225mph. In contrast, the club head speed of a distinctly amateur golfer (me, for example) is around 97mph, the ball taking off at a relatively pedestrian 145mph. Its golf, but not as many people know it. Not even the tour professionals. When Miller launches into his first drive on the range after a brief warm up, it is impossible to see the ball against the backdrop of a grey autumn sky. What is evident, though, is the power Miller possesses. His swing is a violent twisting of limbs, unleashing the club with the potency of a speeding freight train. Cox says instead of trying to pick up the ball using the line of trees at the back of the driving range, I have to watch it right off the club face or else I'll have ""no chance, such is the angle it takes off at."" He's right. The next one I catch sight of immediately and focus on intently for the best part of 10 seconds until it comes to rest some 415 yards away. So how has Miller altered his swing in order to maximize distance? ""I could sit here and bore you for eight or nine hours, going through each tiny little move,"" he laughs. ""Basically, you need the right technique and a lot of speed. ""I always start off with teeing it higher -- I use a four inch tee. That is going to give us the right launch conditions. ""Then I take a wide stance, a longer swing and use tighter angles. We use our wrists a lot to create a lot of levers. ""It's the complete opposite of what you do for short or mid irons, or chipping, it's trying to gather as much speed as you can and unleash it at that last second."" Miller's obsession with distance is one reflected at all levels of golf, he says. Every single player on the planet would snap your hand off if they were offered an extra 20-yards to add onto their drives and iron shots. That has helped foster a dynamic design culture among the game's manufacturers, one that has helped grow the discipline of long driving enormously over the last five years. Miller's specialist drivers are made with two degrees of loft (regular tour players use 9.5 degree drivers) and have minimum flexibility in the shaft. They are also built to withstand ferocious hitting. ""Technology as it has progressed -- with shafts and the heads -- it plays a huge part,"" Miller explains. ""When you are swinging 150mph or over, clubs even three or four years ago, weren't designed to hold that. The heads were blowing up in two seconds. ""The clubs now are a million times better. It was a learning curve for my sponsor, Callaway, to produce something that's got a flat face and has to withstand ball speeds coming off at 220mph. ""There are clubs out there that can't do that and would blow up with one hit. The technology is going to get better once other companies are on board -- then there is a rivalry. it is always going to grow, just like the game. ""I think it shows how long driving has progressed. When I came back to the UK after winning the world championships in 2010 nobody, apart from the real fans of it, knew about it. ""I had to come back and do something with it, I was going out and getting some exposure in magazines and the television. It's been a steady incline. It's paying dividends now -- people are noticing it. It feels great. ""It motivates me even more because people are recognizing the sport now."" Cox says there are up to 50 points of Miller's swing that have been tweaked from a regular tour pro's to maximize the length he hits the ball. After studying over 100 long hitters they embarked on a process of trial and error, experimenting with different positions, swing techniques, hip and foot positions. ""It's been a learning curve for me and Lee,"" he said. ""He's been teaching for over 20 years and it's only now when you start looking at the bio mechanics of it and these tiny micro moves that are in a golf swing that you wouldn't see unless you have a trained eye. ""It's so fine, half a per cent here or there, whatever it is. Whatever the pros are working you can times that by five, six, seven, maybe ten times. ""When you are looking for those extra yards, all of a sudden you realize how much the body can change and how much is involved in that."" Miller's jet-propelled swing is backed up by numbers. A lot of numbers. Propped up on the ground behind Miller is a Flightscope box that records all sorts of information from his swing. It is almost as if he and his coach are speaking a different language when analyzing the data -- angle of attack, flight plane, dynamic loft and spin ratios are all mentioned. It all boils down to this; Miller needs to execute the perfect technical swing, and connect with the ball, not only right in the middle of the club, but also at the right angle, for it to fly. Doing it under pressure, in front of a 5,000 strong crowd at the Re-Max world championships, is next on the agenda, as Miller aims to recapture his crown. ""The crowd adds the adrenaline,"" he admits. ""If you get the crowd behind you, for me it plays a massive part. I could never replicate that here when you've people shouting and screaming."" There's only a limited crowd on show at Brocket Hall but we are still in awe of Miller's hitting prowess. And when I (foolishly) challenge him to a competition, his game face is on immediately. The brisk conditions do neither of us any favors, but I'm content with my drive that lands 238 yards away and trickles to the 260 mark. It was cold, remember. The data shows my club head speed at a respectable 97mph, the ball coming off the face at a not slovenly 145 mph. Unsurprisingly, Miller makes my effort look feeble -- his ball flies off the face at 208mph, hit by a club that was wielded towards impact at 144mph. His lands 112 yards past the distance where mine finished and eventually comes to rest 397 yards away -- over 30 yards longer than the height of the London Shard. Still, there's no disgrace in that. I play golf with some people who would struggle to hit it 397 yards in two shots.","England's Joe Miller gunning to be crowned golf's world long driving champion .

"(CNN) -- American Presidents have come and gone -- but one club tends to unite them all. So often a meeting point for the captains of politics and industry, the golf course has been one of the most popular friends of U.S. leaders since the early part of the 20th century. From William Taft, the 27th President, who introduced the game to the White House, through to Barack Obama, the game has remained a constant in American political life. If Obama has been criticized in recent weeks for spending too much time on the course, there are other presidents who have been equally ardent golfers. ""Golf has inspired Presidents throughout history,"" Mike Trostel, historian at the United States Golf Association, told CNN. ""It's good exercise but there's also the chance for dialogue with people in politics. ""It's a game of integrity and Presidents have seen golf as the sport of leaders."" All but three of the 18 presidents since the start of the 20th century have picked up a club during their time at the White House. Herbert Hoover felt it was inappropriate to be seen on the golf course during the Great Depression, while neither Harry Truman nor Jimmy Carter were particularly keen on the sport. George W. Bush was a keen golfer, but like Hoover, he too was wary of public perception so curtailed his playing when in office. While U.S. troops were fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, he would later recall, he refrained from playing as a mark of respect. According to Troestl, it was Taft who was one of the first presidents to take up golf during his 1909-13 tenure. A big man, Taft struggled with the more physically demanding sports, and local newspapers often published cartoons mocking his size. But even though he was a rather portly figure, golf was one sport he managed to play without too many problems. His love for golf was nothing compared to his successor, Woodrow Wilson. Wilson was fanatical about the sport, says Troestl, even ordering his secret service guards to paint his golf balls so he could practice his driving in the snow. During his time in office, which lasted for eight years until 1921, Wilson played over 1,000 rounds of golf. He often spent time swinging his clubs while debating policy and even met his second wife, Edith, after playing a round of golf -- and she later took up the game as First Lady. While several Commanders in Chief enjoyed golf, it was Dwight Eisenhower who really established it as the sport of Presidents. ""Eisenhower played over 800 rounds during his tenure,"" says Trostel. ""He would practice every morning and had a putting green just outside his office where he would dictate to his secretary."" It was Eisenhower's friendship with leading professional Arnold Palmer which really helped to establish golf in the U.S., according to Trostel. The men were two of the nation's most famous faces during the 1950s and 1960s and their friendship blossomed through the sport. Palmer won seven major titles during his illustrious career, four of which came at The Masters at Augusta, a particular favorite with Eisenhower. ""Both Palmer and Eisenhower peaked at the same time,"" says Trostel. ""They had a shared passion for the game and played lots of rounds together. They really helped to create a secondary boom for golf in the U.S. ""Palmer in particular had great appeal. He was handsome, played with a real swashbuckling style, was a risk taker and was exciting to watch. ""Both him and Eisenhower transcended the sport."" Eisenhower made 45 trips to Augusta -- five before he took up residence at the White House, 29 as President and 11 after his time in office. The Eisenhower Cabin, which was built in the 1950s, still stands and is one of 10 cabins on the course. Ike's Pond, a three-acre water hazard which sits next to the eighth and ninth holes, still remains but the famous old tree which once adorned the course is no longer. The Eisenhower Tree, which stood next to the 17th hole, was removed in March 2014 after suffering structural damage. The Loblolly Pine, standing at some 65 feet, was estimated to be over 120 years old and was a constant nuisance to Eisenhower, who wanted it removed. At a club meeting in 1956, Eisenhower, who had a habit of managing to hit the tree on many an occasion, was overruled by Augusta chairman Clifford Roberts, who refused to have the tree torn down. While Eisenhower's enthusiasm for golf could not be doubted, his skill levels failed to match those of other Presidents. According to Trostel, John F. Kennedy was the most talented golfing leader, while Gerald Ford could also unleash a mean drive. Ronald Reagan was also an aficionado, occasionally putting down the aisles on Air Force One. ""Kennedy was probably the best golfer to have been President,"" says Trostel. ""He didn't play as much as the others but he was keen not to attract attention. ""He played on the Harvard golf team and was a single-digit handicapper. ""Gerald Ford played in tournaments and while he could be erratic, sometimes hitting people in the gallery, he was a good athlete and had a good drive."" In more recent times, Bill Clinton has entertained on the golf course, even joking that he's the only President whose handicap went down during a term in office. While Richard Nixon had previously removed the White House putting green, Clinton had it reinstalled. Clinton now hosts his own PGA Tour tournament in California, having taken over the ailing Bob Hope Classic a decade after the comedian passed away and renaming it the Humana Challenge. In 1995, while in office, Clinton played at the event in a pro-am team with Hope, Ford, George H.W. Bush and defending champion Scott Hoch. ""Presidents need to rest their minds, not just their bodies,"" Clinton told Golf Digest magazine in 2012. ""They need the exercise, the fresh air. And they need to do something that, literally, takes them away from what they're doing. ""The day I played with President Obama, I'd had about three hours' sleep, and I was so exhausted I could barely stand up. ""But when the president calls and asks you to play golf, you show up.""

"Shootings, attempted assassinations and intimidation - welcome to Libyan football in 2013. The country's largest club Al-Ahly, which is based in the capital Tripoli, had been due to face Tersana Tuesday in its latest league match, but its participation in the national league was thrown into jeopardy after its Egyptian coach Hossam al-Badri was shot at following the 1-1 draw against Al Sowaihili on October 12. Al-Badri told CNN Arabic then that he wanted to spend Eid al-Adha -- one of the two most important festivals in the Muslim calendar -- in Cairo and spend time thinking about if he would resume his duty in Tripoli or not. The club told local media: ""Our coach was shot at, at his home after a match in the league against Al Sowaihili that ended 1-1. He is safe but upset after what happened. ""Three men in a car shot at him. The police have launched a full-scale investigation."" Two days later, Libya international striker Mohamed Al-Maghrabi, was shot in the arm by a sniper and rushed to hospital where is recovering. According to the club's official Facebook page, the incident was an assassination attempt, while it also stated that ""many players from the club"" had received death threats on their mobile phones. The 53-year-old Al-Badri steered Cairo's Al-Ahly to the African Champions League title last November before joining the Libyan club in May. Club president Sassi Bouaoun has traveled to the Egyptian capital in a bid to convince his manager to return. In an interview with Libyan television, Bouaoun confirmed the team had returned to training and was already preparing for the upcoming game against Tersana. He also stated that because of the country's fragile security situation that there are opponents who do not wish to see Al-Ahly at the top of the league. 'Stranded' footballer Zahir Belounis told he can leave Qatar . Football in Libya only resumed last month after being brought to a halt in February 2011 by the civil conflict which ousted the dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The Ministry of Sport has held meetings with the Libyan Football Association and its members in a bid to provide extra security for staff, players and fans. Al-Ahly Tripoli had won its first two games of the season before the attacks . The incidents will cast a shadow over Libya's plans to host the 2017 African Cup of Nations. The Confederation of African Football was not immediately available for comment on the Al- Ahly Tripoli attacks. The country is only just recovering from the kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan following an attempted coup carried out by political opponents determined to topple his government. Zeidan was abducted from a luxury hotel in Tripoli and held for several hours by militia gunmen before being released. The incident, which highlights threats posed by militias, is just one of several which have occurred since the revolution two years ago. Armed militias have roamed the country largely unchecked since the 2011 ouster of Gadhafi. Gangs of armed men have surrounded key ministries, including the Justice Ministry, trying to force out members of the democratically elected government. Salah Marghani, the justice minister, was forced to evacuate after armed militias surrounded his ministry in April. Libyan intelligence services have warned that the country is becoming a haven for al Qaeda to regroup and regenerate itself. According to government officials, numerous weapons left over after Gadhafi's downfall are providing groups with different motivations to form their own militias.","Libya's Al-Ahly will return to action on October 26 following shooting of coach .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama hosted a White House reception Monday in honor of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month, but faced criticism for not keeping campaign promises to the community. President Obama signed same-sex benefits legislation earlier this month. ""I continue to support measures to bring the full spectrum of equal rights to LGBT Americans,"" the president said in a proclamation this month. ""These measures include enhancing hate crimes laws, supporting civil unions and federal rights for LGBT couples, outlawing discrimination in the workplace, ensuring adoption rights, and ending the existing 'don't ask, don't tell' policy in a way that strengthens our armed forces and our national security."" But critics say it's too little, too late. A memorandum signed this month by Obama means same-sex partners of civil service employees can be added to the long-term care program, employees can use their sick leave to take care of domestic partners, and children and same-sex partners of Foreign Service employees will be included in medical evacuations and housing allocations, according to the White House. But it does not extend full health care coverage, which would require an act of Congress. ""It seems to me at least to be a nice gesture, but a disappointment,"" Richard Kim, a senior editor at The Nation magazine, said at the time. ""It will absolutely be seen as something good. But I think, for example, it not including full health insurance, that is going to put a real microscope on that question. You know, why not?"" Kim said, adding that memo applies only to federal employees, so most people will not be affected by it. The extension of health and retirement benefits to same-sex partners is prohibited under the Defense of Marriage Act. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the entire memorandum violates the act. ""President Obama's ... executive order uses taxpayer money to placate an angry portion of his base at the expense of the rule of law,"" Perkins said this month in a written statement. ""This order raises the question of whether the president has the authority to ignore (the Defense of Marriage Act) and bypass the legislative process."" Charles Moran, the spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, said the lack of full benefits in the June 18 memorandum shows a lack of commitment to the gay community. ""That's the part that just shows that the Obama administration really isn't serious about their promises to the gay and lesbian community. Things like the health benefits, things like retirement benefits and coverage for spouses -- these are the core issues,"" Moran said. He said Obama has had multiple opportunities to fulfill his promises to the gay and lesbian community -- including by repealing the military's don't ask, don't tell policy and standing against the Justice Department motion filed this month in support of the Defense of Marriage Act. ""Here we are, several months after he's been inaugurated, and we've gotten basically nothing. So it is too little, too late,"" Moran said. Obama said he still wants to repeal the act, as he advocated during last year's election campaign. ""I believe it's discriminatory. I think it interferes with states' rights, and we will work with Congress to overturn it,"" he said. Obama frequently spoke in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the presidential campaign, but also has said he opposes same-sex marriage. In the run up to his inauguration, he declared himself ""a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian Americans."" Given the support Obama received from the gay community during the campaign season, Kim said, so far the Obama administration has let gay and lesbian rights activists down. Obama got 70 percent of the vote from those who identified themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to CNN exit polls. ""I think there is an overwhelming feeling that he has not lived up to expectations on these matters,"" he said. Obama is the second U.S. president to recognize the community. Bill Clinton designated June 2000 as Gay and Lesbian Pride month.","Obama stops short of giving full health care coverage to same-sex partners .

"(CNN)Can this prince topple the king of world football's governing body? Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein has stepped forward to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency at May's election. Blatter, 78, is seeking a fifth consecutive term in office despite growing disillusion with the way the organization has been run during his tenure. The Swiss, who became president in 1998, has not faced a credible challenger since taking office but will now find himself in the middle of a real battle. ""I am seeking the presidency of FIFA because I believe it is time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport,"" Prince Ali said in a statement. ""This was not an easy decision. It came after careful consideration and many discussions with respected FIFA colleagues over the last few months. ""The message I heard, over and over, was that it is time for a change. The world's game deserves a world-class governing body — an International Federation that is a service organization and a model of ethics, transparency and good governance."" FIFA has been been heavily criticized following allegations of corruption over its bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup and Qatar the event for 2022. A FIFA investigation found no wrongdoing in the process. Prince Ali, 39, is the third son of Jordan's late King Hussein from his marriage to his third wife, Queen Alia. He was elected FIFA vice president representing Asia in 2011. He also serves as the president of Jordan's soccer governing body and is founder and president of the West Asia Football Federation. Prince Ali has played a key role in the promotion of women's sport, securing Jordan's position as hosts of the Women's under-17 World Cup which is scheduled to take place next year. He also  successfully campaigned to lift the ban on female Islamic players wearing headscarves during competition. The Asian Football Development Project, a non-profit organization, was created by Prince Ali in 2012 to encourage youth participation in football throughout the continent. It runs projects across Asia on empowering women within football, youth development and raising knowledge of the game. Prince Ali is believed to already have secured the backing of Michel Platini, the president of UEFA, Europe's governing body. Platini is expected to examine the policies and manifesto of the Jordanian royal before recommending to the 54 members of Uefa that they back the candidate at the election on May 29 in Zurich. In a statement made on Tuesday, the Frenchman said: ""I know Prince Ali well. He has all the credibility required to hold high office. We now await his proposals and his program for the future of football."" But Prince Ali faces a more difficult challenge to secure support from his own region with a number of countries in the Asian Football Confederation likely to support his opponent. Speaking to reporters last November, Shaikh Salman bin Al Khalifa, head of the AFC, reiterated his confederation's support for Blatter. ""We made it clear during the Brazil congress (in June) and even in the official nomination when President Blatter nominated himself and we all said that AFC is supporting of Sepp Blatter in the next election,"" he told reporters last year. ""This is the decision by the congress and a decision by the exco. What I heard in the media is so far unofficial and I can't comment on that. All I can comment on about is the official stand where the AFC and the exco have made it clear. ""I'm just focusing on what we have decided upon and agreed upon and I think that Jordan and Prince Ali were a part of that Congress. ""I think we made up our mind and we decided and that's it. We are, lets say, a nation that we don't change our minds. Once we commit and we give our word then we are committed."" One additional problem facing Prince Ali is that his own place on the executive committee could come under threat. According to a rule change implemented last June by the AFC, the head of the confederation, in this case Sheik Salman, will take the seat on the executive committee and the vice presidency too. To ensure he remains on the executive committee, Prince Ali will have to win one of Asia's seats if he is to keep his place. Prince Ali will attend the Asia Cup in Australia which begins this week and is expected to be quizzed on his proposals and policies. But he remains adamant that any campaign should be about football and not the organization he is hoping to lead. ""The headlines should be about football, not about FIFA,"" he said. ""FIFA exists to serve a sport which unites billions of people from all over the world, people of differing and divergent political, religious and social affiliations, who come together in their enjoyment of 'the world's game.'"" Prince Ali joins Frenchman Jerome Champagne in announcing his intention to stand against Blatter. The cut off  point for those wanting to contest the election is January 29.","""The headlines should be about football, not about FIFA,"" says Prince Ali bin Al Hussein .

"(CNN) -- The possible discovery of salmonella has prompted a limited recall of Skippy reduced-fat peanut butter spreads sold in 16 states, its parent company announced. Unilever issued a press release Friday detailing a voluntary recall of Skippy's ""Reduced Fat Creamy"" and ""Reduced Fat Super Chunk"" brands. The recall applies only to these branded items distributed in Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. While there have been no known illnesses, the recall was issued for fear that some of the peanut butter now in stores had salmonella. The press release said that Unilever acted after inspectors conducting ""routine sampling"" found that ""finished products may contain the bacteria."" There was no indication of where exactly the contamination was found, its severity or what steps were being taken to address it beyond the recall. The recalled products are sold in 16.3-ounce plastic jars, have UPC codes of 048001006812 or 048001006782 and have best-if-used-by-dates of May 16-21, 2012, on the top, the company statement said. Those with such jars should throw them away and call Skippy at 1-800-453-3432 to get a replacement coupon, according to Unilever. The Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey-based company issued the recall in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration, which posted a copy of Unilever's statement on its government website. Salmonella is a bacterial infection that usually lasts four to seven days. About 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported each year in the United States, according to the CDC. Those who get it typically develop fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Most people recover on their own, without needing significant treatment. But salmonella in very young and very old people, as well as those with weakened immune systems, can lead to severe illness and even death. The CDC recommends that anyone suspecting he or she may be ill from eating contaminated food should talk to a doctor.","Salmonella was discovered during ""routine sampling,"" the company says .

"(CNN) -- Ecuador's Tungurahua volcano erupted Saturday, sending ash and lava spewing nearly a mile into the sky. Residents evacuated the area after the country's National Agency of Risk Control issued a ""red alert."" The warning was later downgraded to orange, as the volcano became less active. Activity at Tungurahua -- which means ""throat of fire"" in the native Quechua language -- peaked Saturday between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., according to the Geological Institute in Quito. At one point, the ash cloud reached nearly 3 km (1.9 miles) above the volcano's crater, according to the institute, and lava flowed about 2 km from the crater. The glacier-capped, 16,478-foot (5,023-meter) volcano has erupted periodically since 1999, when increased activity led to the temporary evacuation of the city of Banos at the foot of the volcano. Major eruptions also occurred in August 2006 and February 2008, according to the government's emergency management agency. Prior to this more recent activity, the last major eruption was between 1916 and 1918. Relatively minor activity continued until 1925, the Smithsonian Institution said on its volcano website. The volcano is 140 km south of Quito, Ecuador's capital. CNN's Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.","Ash and lava spew from the Tungurahua volcano .

"Leading international soccer player Mario Balotelli has had enough -- the AC Milan striker has vowed to walk off the pitch next time he is racially abused at a football game. Balotelli, who was subjected to racist chanting during Sunday's Italian league game against Roma, has told CNN in an exclusive interview that he came close to leaving the field following the abuse at AC Milan's San Siro stadium in a match that finished 0-0. The 22-year-old put his fingers to his lips in front of the visiting supporters' section as a section of fans directed ""monkey chants"" at him and teammate Kevin Prince-Boateng. ""I always said that if it (racism) happened in the stadium I will just do like 'nobody says nothing and I don't care,'"" Balotelli told CNN. ""But this time I think I've changed my mind a little bit. If it's going to happen one more time, then I'm going to leave the pitch because it's so stupid."" The abuse led to the game being halted for two minutes as the stadium's PA announcer warned the Roma supporters to end the abuse or the match would be stopped. Balotelli is not the first player from AC Milan -- one of Europe's top clubs, having won 18 national titles and seven continental crowns -- -- to face racist abuse this season. In January, Boateng did walk off the pitch after being racially abused during a friendly against Pro Patria. That action prompted governing bodies FIFA and UEFA to rethink the way clubs and players are punished if they are found guilty of racist abuse. Balotelli revealed that his teammate Boateng -- who was a guest speaker at the United Nation's International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in March -- persuaded him not to leave the field of play on Sunday. ""I spoke with Prince,"" added Balotelli. ""I was about to leave the pitch on Sunday, but they thought I wanted to leave because we had some difficulty with the game and then we are going to win 3-0. ""I said 'no, it's better we play and I will talk,' that's it. ""But if it wasn't for this reason, then I was going to leave the pitch on Sunday."" On Monday Roma was fined $65,000 by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) -- a punishment that drew sharp criticism from FIFA president Sepp Blatter . ""What is $65,000 for such an incident? I'm not happy and I will call the Italian Federation,"" the head of football's world governing body told the FIFA website. ""That's not a way to deal with such matters."" Throughout the season Italian football has been plagued by racist incidents as the country struggles to deal with the problem. Only last month, Inter Milan was fined around $60,000 by European governing body UEFA after its fans were found guilty of ""improper conduct"" after racist chants were directed at Tottenham's Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor. In February, Roma's fierce city rival, Lazio, received its fourth UEFA charge of the season for racist behavior with the club accruing fines of up to $300,000 . Mancini's sacking no surprise for Balotelli . ""Family's little black boy"" This is not the first time Balotelli has suffered racist abuse. The striker was targeted by fans of his former club -- Inter Milan -- in a Serie A game after he joined Milan in a $30 million deal from Manchester City in January. Inter was fined $65,500 by the FIGC following the incidents while the player was also hit with a $13,000 fine for aiming a gesture at fans as he left the field at the full time whistle. Balotelli played for Inter between 2006 and 2010. The 22-year-old was also subjected to racist abuse while on international duty with Italy -- Croatia fans were found guilty of throwing bananas at the forward during the 2012 European Championship Finals. There was also embarrassment for Milan in February when the club's vice president Paulo Berlusconi, the younger brother of former prime minster and team owner Silvio Berlusconi, was caught on camera referring to Balotelli's arrival by saying: ""OK, we are all off to see the family's little black boy. ""He's a crazy head. All the young ladies are invited as well -- you can even have a chance to meet the president (Silvio Berlusconi)."" The video, which was featured on the website of Italian Newspaper La Repubblica, was condemned by anti-racism campaigners. Milan have won the Italian title 18 times and the European Cup (now known as the Champions League) seven times.","Mario Balotelli says he will walk off the pitch next time he is racially abused .

"No one knows exactly how long the 2-year-old pit bull had been left to die alone in the Arizona mountains. A photo taken by Andi Davis, the hiker who found him, shows the dog half standing, half collapsed, his head pressing against a rock. Davis had walked about a half mile uphill last Friday, October 18, along a deserted trail in Phoenix when she found the black and white dog, suffering from bullet wounds, said Arizona Humane Society spokeswoman Bretta Nelson in an e-mail. She hesitated for a moment before approaching the pit bull, Nelson said. But when he lifted his head as she reached for her water bottle, Davis put her apprehension aside, gave him a drink and then lifted the 47-pound dog into her arms, Nelson said. Then, she began walking. ""It will be OK,"" Davis kept telling the dog as she slowly picked her way down the path. Every so often she would stop, give him another drink, then stand up again and keep going. ""At first she was shaking because she was scared,"" Nelson said. ""Then she was shaking because of the weight of him."" Eventually the dog stopped moving. Andi Davis was overwhelmed by the media attention and did not want to talk, but gave Nelson the permission to do so. ""When my mom found our new dog on the mountain, my heart broke at the first sight of him,"" said Andi's daughter Jessi, 10, in a letter to Nelson and the AHS. ""He was torn up. Everywhere."" Described as a ""very fit person,"" it took Davis an hour to complete the journey, her arms aching, Nelson said. Davis's husband and daughter met her at the bottom and they took the dog to the Arizona Humane Society, where veterinarians examined him. ""I thought I would never see him again,"" Jessi said. ""I knew he was in good hands, but I still felt very sad."" Doctors found an open abdominal wound, bullet fragments near his spinal cord and a bullet in the middle of his neck, Nelson said. The Davis family named him Elijah. ""I was so, so happy when we got to see him,"" Jessi wrote. Nelson said Elijah responded to Jessi as if ""they had been best friends their whole lives."" Elijah is now adjusting to his new foster home, where he is getting to know the other Davis dogs. ""Mom has a dog, dad has a dog, I have a dog,"" Jessi told Nelson. ""Elijah is the family dog. Because he's special."" As for Andi, her arms still ache even though it's been a week since the rescue. Nelson said it's unlikely any investigation will be conducted to find the person who injured Elijah since there isn't a clear timetable and no witnesses have come forward. ""After all you have done for us,"" Jessi said in her letter. ""I want to help animals too. Thank you so much for making our lives better. You rock.""","Pit bull with bullet wounds abandoned on mountain trail .

"(CNN)On the pitch David Ginola was renowned for his poise and elegance. But in his pitch to unseat Sepp Blatter and become the next president of FIFA, those qualities lasted about as long as the glossy montage to announce his candidacy. In public relations terms, this was not a roaring success. Suspicions had been raised by news the former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player's bid for soccer's top job was being funded by a well-known bookmaker with a self-confessed penchant for outrageous publicity stunts. The revelation that Ginola was being paid £250,000 ($379,000) for his involvement -- with another £100,000 earmarked for the football legend's ""security"" -- allied to his sketchiness when fielding questions about world football's governing body and the detail of his campaign, did little to dampen the skepticism. ""I'm here today to talk about love. I'm here to share some of the most powerful emotions any of us have experienced,"" was the 47-year-old's impassioned opening gambit. ""That is what football means to me, you and the billions of fans across the planet. That's why we're so disappointed when we talk about some of the problems with the way our game is being run. ""It's time to change that. It's time to reboot football."" Ginola briefly touched on a few key themes of his campaign; complete financial transparency as well as more funding for grassroots soccer and the women's game. But his bid to ""reboot football"" could fall at the first hurdle unless he can persuade five FIFA football associations to back him before the end of January and validate his candidacy. His campaign team also have some work to do in ""rebooting"" Ginola's knowledge of football politics it would seem. Quizzed on the issue of third party ownership of clubs, or challenged to name some of FIFA's executive committee members, he was unable to offer any tangible answers. ""We are just at the beginning of the journey,"" he replied. ""There are a few issues I will have to deal with and I think we are going to get to it in the next few days."" Even if Ginola attracts the five backers he needs, he must then face the seemingly insurmountable task of toppling current incumbent Blatter. FIFA's president is in the 17th year of his reign and enjoys overwhelming support from the majority of organization's 209 members, despite persistent allegations of corruption surrounding the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Ginola is undeterred though, insisting he didn't want to ""fight against the man himself"" but that a positive campaign would strike a chord with football fans all over the globe. ""There is no room for doubt in football,"" Ginola said. ""If we cannot remove all suspicion or doubt there cannot be trust. ""I want FIFA to be seen as an example all around the world. It's the most popular game and it must set an example for everyone on earth. ""There are three things that are very important to me: transparency, democracy and equality."" If Ginola's fee raised eyebrows, they were arched ever more at the request for fans to back their support with cold, hard cash; his team estimating that £2.3 million ($3.4m) will be required to run a full and proper crusade for office. Betting company Paddy Power kick-started the funding for the project and its pedigree when it comes to publicity stunts prompted many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as its latest attempt to grab column inches. In 2010 they offered odds on which animal would be driven to extinction first by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and last year promised ""money back if he walks"" relating to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. ""We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world,"" Paddy Power, son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained. ""This is not that. This is for real. ""What we bring is maybe the muscle to get the ball rolling, but this is going to be crowd funded and hopefully the fans will get behind it and join the team. ""We've provided the platform, now it's up to us to stand back and hand it over to the fans to make it happen."" Also part of the ""Team Ginola"" launch was David Larkin, a sports lawyer, who told CNN the move was revolutionary in terms of FIFA's presidential race as it mapped out exactly where the funds would be apportioned. ""If you live in the real world, you have to pay bills,"" he said of Paddy Power's involvement. ""We're going to be honest and tell you what we're paying to who -- nobody else is doing that. ""The irony is that so far the David Ginola campaign is the only one to do so and that has brought criticism. We have real transparency and real democracy at play here."" Ginola vowed to flesh out the detail of his campaign in the coming days and weeks as his team sets its sights on lobbying for those five required votes. But amid the soaring rhetoric and 'Yes we can' mentality there was still an air of distrust in the media pack relating to Paddy Power's role. Journalist Owen Gibson, who writes for The Guardian newspaper, told CNN: ""Personally I'm deeply uneasy about the Paddy Power connection. ""It's toxic because they are well known for their stunts and getting into the news in any way they can. It's a win-win for them -- they get plenty of PR, and it's a win for David because he gets his fee. ""The danger is for those people who do want to see a genuine alternative; on the plus side we're getting these issues debated, and talking about how things might change. ""On the flip side you've got the practical obstacles of getting five nominations by end of the month and the cynicism that will be generated by the fact it's backed by a major bookmaker with a reputation for controversy and stunts."" Gibson, who thought some of the questions directed at Ginola with the aim of tripping him up were ""unfair,"" said it was highly unlikely the Frenchman's bid would represent a real challenge to Blatter. ""Slim to none would be a good way of summing up Ginola's chances,"" he said. ""If Paddy Power were running the book it'd be interesting to see what odds they'd give you on him getting a nomination let alone winning the thing. ""Jerome Champagne (an independent candidate) has been going for a year and is struggling to get over that hurdle. That's going to be a huge task for them in three weeks to get the required nominations."" But Ginola's optimism refused to waver as he conducted round after round of media interviews, bedecked in a sharp, blue suit. ""It is a serious challenge and I do care,"" Ginola told CNN. ""I think it is brave to embrace this challenge. I knew there would be tough questions."" On the involvement of Paddy Power he said: ""Bookmakers are in the game and today thanks to them we have this opportunity to launch this campaign."" ""David Ginola is perfect man to front the bid,"" Larkin added. ""This a real footballer raising his hand in a brave fashion saying 'I'm willing to represent the fans.' ""It's a political game. No-one has more charisma, more charm or the people skills that David Ginola has. ""If we didn't think we had a real shot at getting five nominations we wouldn't waste anyone's time. We respect the fans' time -- they've got better things to do than deal with stunts.""","David Ginola launches his bid to become president of FIFA in London .

"(CNN) -- The beating of Rodney King 20 years ago Thursday marked the end of a 100-mph car chase and the beginning of a chain of events that would forever change Los Angeles, its police department and the racial conversation in the United States. King, then a 25-year-old convicted robber on parole, admittedly had a few drinks under his belt as he headed home from a friend's house. When he spotted a police car following him, he panicked, thinking he would be sent back to prison. So he took off. ""I had a job to go to that Monday, and I knew I was on parole, and I knew I wasn't supposed to be drinking, and I'm like, 'Oh my God,' "" King told CNN in a recent interview. Realizing he couldn't outrun police but knowing what they were likely to do to him when they caught him, King said he looked for a public place to stop. ""I saw all those apartments over there, so I said, 'I'm gonna stop right there. If it goes down, somebody will see it.' "" It did go down. Four police officers, all of them white, struck King more than 50 times with their wood batons and shocked him with an electric stun gun. "" 'We are going to kill you, n****r,' "" King said police shouted as they beat him. The officers denied using racial slurs. King was right in his expectation of a beating, but his hope of having a witness was fulfilled in a big way. Not only did somebody see it, somebody videotaped it -- still a novelty in 1991, before people had cell phone cameras. The video showed a large lump of a man floundering on the ground, surrounded by a dozen or more police officers, four of whom were beating him relentlessly with nightsticks. One officer's swings slow down as he appears worn out by his nonstop flailing. King was beaten nearly to death. Three surgeons operated on him for five hours that morning. The dramatic video of the episode appeared on national TV two days later. At last, blacks in L.A. -- and no doubt in other parts of the country -- had evidence to document the police brutality many had known but most of America had always denied or tolerated. ""We finally caught the Loch Ness Monster with a camcorder,"" King attorney Milton Grimes said. Four LAPD officers -- Theodore Briseno, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Sgt. Stacey Koon -- were indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer. In April 1992, after a three-month trial in the predominantly white suburb of Simi Valley, three of the officers were acquitted of all charges. But the jury, which had no black members, was deadlocked on one charge of excessive force against Powell. A mistrial was declared on that charge. Powell's attorney, Michael Stone, said the unedited video worked against King and helped prove the officers' case. ""Most of the nation only saw a few snippets where it's the most violent. They didn't see him get up and run at Powell,"" Stone said. ""In a use-of-force case, if the officers do what they're trained to do, how can you find them guilty of a crime? And the jury understood that."" Still, black Los Angeles exploded in outrage. Rioters rampaged through the streets, looting businesses, torching buildings and attacking people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. On the third day of rioting, King emerged from seclusion to make a plea that echoes to this day: ""People, I just want to say, can we all get along?"" he said. ""Can we get along?"" By the time it was over, 55 people were dead, more than 2,000 were hurt, and property damage exceeded $1 billion. Nearly a year later, the four officers were tried in federal court on civil rights charges. This trial would be very different from the first: It took place in Los Angeles, two African-Americans were picked for the jury and King actually testified this time. ""There was no way in the world that any jury would acquit all of the defendants again,"" Stone, the defense attorney, told CNN. King's own testimony may have hurt the federal case, as he hedged on whether police had used racial slurs during the beating. King recently told CNN that slurs definitely were uttered, but he said he vacillated on the stand because his mother had advised him to avoid talking about race. Ultimately, Koon and Powell were found guilty, while Briseno and Wind were acquitted. ""It was like, ... I just hope we just get one. I hope we just get one on that,"" King said. ""If we get one, we're good. So to get the two, I was really happy."" ""We got half-justice,"" his attorney, Grimes, growled, but the verdicts and the 30-month sentences seemed to satisfy the community. There was no unrest. One more trial awaited: Rodney King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. This time, there was only one African-American on the jury, and she was a force to be reckoned with. ""Half of them had no sympathy whatsoever,"" Cynthia Kelly told CNN, referring to her fellow jurors. ""They did not care at all. They just didn't care. Like, 'He broke the law. He deserved what he got.' "" ""I told them they were crazy!"" she recalled. ""It was about justice for what happened to him. No one deserves to get beat like that."" Eventually, the other jurors came around, and King was awarded $3.8 million in damages. It was finally over. But the aftereffects continue to this day. King sometimes still wears a protective vest in response to a fear of reprisal and some genuine threats. And he's had several more run-ins with the law, including a 90-day jail stint in 1996 for a hit-and-run involving his wife at the time. 2001: King arrested three times in six weeks . 2003: King arrested after domestic dispute . 2007: King involved in shooting . Even on Thursday, 20 years to the day after the beating, King had a minor run-in with police. People wonder why he kept getting into trouble. ""The trouble that they see me in is a part of my life that I'm working on,"" he said, acknowledging a long-standing problem with alcohol. In 2008, he appeared on VH1's ""Celebrity Rehab"" reality show. But despite those troubles -- not to mention frequent nightmares and the fact that he's spent virtually all of his share of the $3.8 million -- King says he is happy. He's a grandfather now, and he's engaged to marry a special woman who has returned from his past -- Cynthia Kelly. ""She's a nice, friendly person,"" he said. Things have changed at the LAPD, too. The upper ranks are much more diverse. Changes also have been made -- sometimes under court order -- in the way certain neighborhoods are patrolled and in how complaints are handled. ""The main impact that the Rodney King case had is that it accelerated change,"" journalist Lou Cannon said. ""It's not tenable any longer in the United States of America for a police force of a major city to govern without having the community being a part of that governance."" Whether society itself has sufficiently changed is a question for every generation to consider.","It has been 20 years since the police beating of Rodney King .

"(CNN)Formula One star Fernando Alonso is out of hospital after his high speed crash -- but the Spaniard will not take part in this week's final preseason test in Barcelona. The double world champion was concussed and airlifted to hospital when his McLaren ran wide during winter testing at the Circuit de Catalunya -- home to the Spanish Grand Prix -- on Sunday. ""We are pleased to confirm that Fernando Alonso has now left hospital,"" McLaren said in a statement. ""He has returned to his family's home in Spain for further rest and recuperation."" Alonso gave a thumbs-up to photographers as he walked out of the Cataluna Hospital on Thursday and drove away with his girlfriend. Kevin Magnussen, who effectively lost his McLaren seat to the returning Alonso, will share driving duties with Jenson Button at the four day test which begins on Thursday. Alonso chose to leave Ferrari at the end of the 2014 season and rejoin McLaren, which is also renewing its technical partnership with Japanese engine manufacturer Honda for 2015. The 33-year-old -- regarded by his peers as the best driver on the grid -- is chasing a third world crown but, so far, he has not had chance to gauge the possibilities of realizing that ambition with McLaren. Early reliability problems meant Alonso had only completed 117 laps in the MP4-30 race car before his preseason was curtailed by the crash. McLaren had explained that Alonso's ""accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time."" Turn Three, where the accident took place, is an area of the circuit where cross winds are known to affect the balance of the cars. The team statement continued: ""We can also disclose that no electrical discharge or irregularity of any kind occurred in the car's ERS [energy recovery] system either before, during or after the incident. ""That last point refutes the erroneous rumors that have spread recently to the effect that Fernando was rendered unconscious by an electrical fault. That is simply not true."" McLaren sporting director Eric Boullier had described the crash as ""one of those things that happens during testing."" Alonso will be expected to return to driving duties for CNN sponsored McLaren in first practice for the season opening Australian Grand Prix on March 13.","Fernando Alonso leaves hospital three days after his crash in Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- A Maryland mayor is asking the federal government to investigate why SWAT team members burst into his home without knocking and shot his two dogs to death in an investigation into a drug smuggling scheme. Berwyn Heights, Maryland, Mayor Cheye Calvo comforts wife Trinity Tomsic at a news conference Thursday. ""This has been a difficult week and a half for us,"" Cheye Calvo, mayor of Berwyn Heights, Maryland, said Thursday. ""We lost our family dogs. We did it at the hands of sheriff's deputies who burst through our front door, rifles blazing."" The raid last week was led by the Prince George's County Police Department, with the sheriff's special operations team assisting, after a package of marijuana was sent to Calvo's home. Authorities say the package was part of a scheme in which drugs are mailed to unknowing recipients and then intercepted. Calvo said he had just returned home from walking his two Labrador retrievers, Chase and Payton, when his mother-in-law told him a package had arrived for his wife, Trinity Tomsic. Moments later, Calvo was in his room changing for a meeting when he heard commotion downstairs. ""The door flew open,"" he said. ""I heard gunfire shoot off. There was a brief pause and more gunfire."" Calvo said he was brought downstairs at gunpoint in his boxer shorts, handcuffed and forced onto the floor with his mother-in-law near the carcass of one of dead dogs.  Watch Calvo describe the raid » . ""I noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood,"" Calvo said. Calvo said his mother-in-law is still recovering from the incident. ""She got the worst of it,"" Calvo said. ""She was literally in the kitchen, cooking a lovely pasta dish, and they brought down the door and shot our dogs."" While he was being held, Calvo said, he told police he is the town's mayor, but they didn't believe him. Berwyn Heights has its own police force, he said, but Prince George's County police did not notify the municipal authorities of their interest in his home or the package. ""They didn't know my name. All they knew was my wife's name. They matched that to the registration of the car,"" Calvo said. ""It was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives."" After the raid, arrests were made in the package interception scheme. The incident has prompted the couple to call for a federal investigation because, they say, they don't believe police are capable of conducting an internal investigation. ""They've said they've done nothing wrong,"" Calvo said. ""I didn't sign up for this fight, but I think what we have to do now is make changes to how Prince George's County police and Prince George's County sheriff's department operate."" Calvo said authorities entered his home without knocking and refused to show him a warrant when he requested one. But Prince George's County Police Department spokeswoman Sharon Taylor said legal counsel had informed her that ""no-knock"" warrants do not exist in Maryland.  Watch authorities defend their actions » . Taylor said authorities were acting on a warrant issued based on information available to them at the time. ""This warrant was for permission to search the premises,"" she said. ""The special operations team that supported us made a decision about the necessity of entry at the point of being on the scene."" ""No-knock"" warrants have drawn criticism before. In Atlanta, Georgia, Kathryn Johnston, 92, was shot to death by police in a botched drug raid involving such a warrant in November. Taylor, a self-described dog lover, expressed sympathy for the loss of Calvo's dogs, but stopped short of apologizing for the incident. ""We've done these similar kinds of operations over and over again, to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community and without people or animals being harmed,"" she said. ""We don't want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody, and certainly not animals."" The deputies have said they killed the two animals because they felt threatened. ""I would say that the dogs presented a threat, I would imagine, to the special operations situation,"" Taylor said. Meanwhile, Calvo and his wife said members of the community have expressed sympathy and concern about the incident. At a news conference Thursday, Tomsic tearfully recalled a recent encounter with a neighbor who used to wave at the couple as they walked Payton and Chase. ""She gave me a big hug,"" Tomsic said. ""She said, 'If the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you, how can I trust them?' ""","Raid carried out after marijuana package mailed to home of Cheye Calvo .

"(CNN)Is this the Formula One car of the future? Ferrari has taken the unusual step of unveiling its concept for a radical car redesign on its team website. The streamlined design, which more closely resembles a regular Ferrari sports car, was created by the team's Centro Stile design studio. Ferrari explained it aimed to create a car that is ""not only technologically advanced, but also captivating to the eye and aggressive-looking."" It added: ""Our challenge was to create something that was -- to put it short -- better looking."" The oldest team in F1, already a style icon with its scarlet livery and Prancing Horse logo, invited fans to comment on its concept on its website and through social media. But Ferrari probably did not expect to elicit a response from racing and car design rivals Red Bull, winners of four straight team and driver titles between 2009 and 2011 thanks to the superior aerodynamic design of Adrian Newey. Red Bull Motorsports posted its car concept, designed by Newey for a computer game in 2014 on Twitter with the cheeky message, ""Way ahead of ya, @Scuderia Ferrari ;)"" The aesthetics of F1 cars have attracted plenty of criticism in recent seasons. Who can forget the duck-billed platypus and anteater noses of 2012? ""It would be good if a bit more consideration was given to aesthetics in the drafting of the regulations,"" suggested Newey in an interview with Formula1.com last season. The rules on car design are carefully laid out in millimeters by the sport's governing body, the FIA, whose main aim is to curb speed and increase safety. Ferrari says its concept could roar into reality on track ""without having to overturn the current technical rules."" With the second winter test starting in Barcelona on Thursday, F1's nine teams are still fine tuning a radical rule change, focused on engine technology, which was introduced in 2014. The costs of that regulation change has already seen two teams -- Caterham and Marussia -- slide off the 2015 grid because of a lack of funding. While Ferrari have one eye on the future of F1, the Scuderia is also absorbing more immediate changes. During the winter break, the team has welcomed a new president, Sergio Marchionne, new team boss, Maurizio Arrivabene, and new driver, Sebastian Vettel, as well as restructuring its technical department. The 2015 Ferrari car was fastest in the opening winter test, but testing times can be deceptive and the team's true comparative pace will only be revealed at the opening Australian Grand Prix on March 15. Ferrari may be thinking of the future but, after failing to win a race in 2014, they remain focused on present car improvements for now.","Ferrari unveil radical Formula One car design on its website .

"A Vietnamese fishing boat has sunk after colliding with a Chinese vessel near an island chain in the South China Sea at the center of a territorial dispute between the two Communist neighbors. According to China's state-run Xinhua news agency, the Vietnamese vessel had been ""harassing"" a Chinese fishing boat at 5 p.m. local time on Monday in waters near the Paracel Islands, a largely uninhabited archipelago also known by the Chinese as the Xisha Islands. However, Luu Tien Thang, a senior officer aboard a Vietnamese coast guard boat patrolling waters nearby, told CNN Tuesday the Vietnamese vessel reported that it had actually been rammed by the Chinese ship during a distress call. While the Chinese vessel was purportedly a fishing boat, Luu said there were ""usually Chinese military boats in the area with the fishing fleet."" Other Vietnamese fishing boats and coast guard ships picked up the 10 crew members aboard the Vietnamese vessel, Luu added. Chinese ships reach Vietnam to extract thousands of citizens . 'Forcefully intruded' Relations between China and Vietnam have soured in recent weeks after a state-owned Chinese oil company began drilling for oil some 17 nautical miles off the Paracels. Vietnamese officials say Chinese military and civilian ships have been harassing their vessels around the islands -- which are controlled by Beijing but claimed by Hanoi -- even accusing the Chinese of repeatedly ramming into them and shooting water cannon. China maintains that its current drilling activities are legitimate and blames the Vietnamese for provoking the conflict. At a daily press briefing in Beijing Tuesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang said the Vietnamese vessel had ""forcefully intruded"" into the area where its drilling rig was operating, then ran into the left side of a Chinese fishing boat before capsizing. ""I want to stress that the direct cause for this incident is that the Vietnamese side ... insisted on disturbing the normal operation by the Chinese side and took dangerous action on the sea,"" said Qin. ""We once again urge the Vietnamese side to stop immediately all kinds of disruptive and damaging activities."" He said there is ""no dispute concerning the sovereignty of the Xisha islands,"" and that they are Chinese territory. ""We hope the Vietnamese side will stop its disruptive actions and bear in mind the overall interests of the stability of the region. Only by doing so can the Vietnamese side uphold the overall interests of bilateral relationship,"" Qin added. The spat recently spilled into violent anti-Chinese protests across Vietnam two weeks ago, prompting Beijing to evacuate thousands of its nationals. Recent video aired by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV showed some limping or being carried down the stairs of a medical flight arriving in the city of Chengdu, many with limbs bandaged. Two Chinese nationals were killed in earlier clashes, authorities said. Vietnam characterized the protests as ""spontaneous acts"" by individuals who were exploiting the situation to ""cause social disorder.""","Xinhua: Vietnamese fishing boat sank after colliding with Chinese vessel off Paracel Islands .

"Iran is prepared to expand military and security cooperation with neighboring Iraq, a top Iranian military official said -- a week after U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to establish, boost and expand all types of military, defense and security cooperation with the friendly and brotherly nation of Iraq,"" Iran's armed forces chief of staff  Hassan Firouzabadi said, according to a report Sunday by the semi-official Fars news agency. The Middle East neighbors have enjoyed closer ties in recent years, especially as Iraq's Shia Muslim majority has solidified its power in the absence of former leader Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim.  Iran's theocracy is Shia-led. The development comes as Iran is flexing its naval muscles in the region by staging war games . The drills are the largest ever planned by Iran and are being staged in an area that stretches from the eastern part of the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf to the the Gulf of Aden, Fars reported last week. The maneuvers began on Saturday. ""These war games are a warning to the western countries about the closure of the Strait of Hormuz,"" Zohreh Elahian, a member of parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, said Monday, according to Fars.  ""If any threat is posed to Iran, the Islamic Republic is capable of closing the Strait of Hormuz."" The strait is a narrow shipping channel that leads in and out of the Persian Gulf between Oman and Iran.  It is strategically important because oil tankers carrying Middle East oil travel through it. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq gives Tehran more freedom to exert its influence in Iraq, analysts say. ""It will not have negative effects against Iran,"" said James Gelvin, a history professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, about the U.S. pullout. Mike Breen, vice president of the progressive Truman National Security Project in Washington, described the ties between Iran and Iraq as ""complicated."" ""I would say it's too soon to tell because the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government are only beginning to write the next chapter in their nation's history, and they have a complicated relationship with their neighbor Iran, and that's not always been a positive relationship,"" Breen said. The nations fought a protracted military conflict between 1980 and 1988, in which up to 1.5 million people died.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama told congressional leaders Thursday he's planning to pull all combat troops out of Iraq by August 2010, according to three congressional officials. President Obama says he plans to keep up to 50,000 support troops in Iraq after combat troops leave in 2010. Under this scenario, all combat troops will be withdrawn within 19 months of Obama's January inauguration, three months longer than his promise on the campaign trail. In a meeting at the White House Thursday evening, Obama also told lawmakers that he plans to keep a range of 35,000 to 50,000 support troops on the ground in Iraq after combat troops are out, the officials said. All U.S. troops have to be out of Iraq by December 31, 2011, under an agreement the Bush administration signed with the Iraqi government last year. White House officials confirmed the president will deliver a speech about Iraq to troops at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina on Friday, his first visit to a military base since being sworn into office. The officials refused to comment on the details of Obama's plan. While liberals may be frustrated that Obama is not keeping his campaign promise to the letter, the president could win credit from lawmakers in both parties for giving military commanders more time and flexibility to finish the mission. What may turn out to be more controversial is the number of noncombat troops that will remain in Iraq under Obama's plan. Military officials have stressed that residual, noncombat forces would focus on supplies and logistics to protect U.S. interests in the region. But senior Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have expressed concern over such a large number of troops staying in Iraq after combat forces have left. One source familiar with the discussion told CNN that Democratic lawmakers complained in private to the president about the remaining troops just as they have in public. ""That's a little higher number than I expected,"" Reid said Thursday before the White House meeting. Sen. Richard Durbin, the No. 2  Democrat and a close Obama ally, said before the White House meeting that he's anxious to get troops home. But he defended the administration, saying it is ""trying to strike the right balance"" between ending the war and maintaining stability in Iraq. A spokeswoman for Sen. John McCain, the top Republican on the Senate Arms Services committee and an attendee at the White House meeting, told CNN that McCain supports the plan to leave 50,000 troops in Iraq. Rep. John McHugh, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said after the White House meeting that Obama assured him the plan to withdraw all combat forces will be revisited if conditions on the ground in Iraq deteriorate. ""The president's objective to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq is one we should pray for, plan for, and work toward,"" McHugh said in a written statement. ""However, I remain concerned that the security situation in Iraq is fragile, and we should work to mitigate any risks to our troops and their mission. I specifically raised these points with the president this evening, and he assured me that he will revisit his plan if the situation on the ground deteriorates and violence increases,"" he said. ""Our commanders must have the flexibility they need in order to respond to these challenges, and President Obama assured me that there is a 'Plan B,'"" McHugh said.","Timeline keeps troops in Iraq three months longer than Obama had pledged .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A 15-year-old boy remained in a psychiatric facility Tuesday after Monroe, New York, police arrested him in connection with a plot to attack his former high school on the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, police said. Police say the boy targeted Monroe-Woodbury High School, although he was no longer a student there. He was charged as a juvenile and faces two felony counts of criminal possession of a weapon, Monroe Police Chief Dominic Giudice said. Police withheld the name of the teen, who was arrested Monday after police executed a search warrant at his residence. There they found four bottles filled with gasoline, a torch, machete, black trench coat, three propane tanks, two computers, items that could be used as fuses and several other electronic devices, according to a Monroe Police Department press release issued Tuesday. The supplies were found in the garage, Giudice said, but the teen's parents had been unaware of their son's intentions until he told police what he had planned to do. Police also discovered the teen had actively been seeking a military assault-type weapon that could ""hold as many rounds as possible."" The boy told police investigators he had been bullied by fellow students and had been told that he resembled Columbine shooter Eric Harris, the press release said. A detective on the case told Giudice that the teen appeared to be composed during the interview, as if he were just having another conversation. Police said the plot was planned for April 20 at Monroe-Woodbury High School, which is the anniversary of the Columbine shooting in Colorado, in which 12 students and a teacher were killed. The date also is Adolf Hitler's birthday. ""He said that he had a lot of hatred toward a lot of the kids who attend that school,"" the press release said. The boy had attended the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District but recently began attending another school, police said. In a statement released by the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District today, superintendent Joseph DiLorenzo indicated that students had come forward with information that may have averted the alleged plot. ""We are working closely with law enforcement to do everything possible to keep our children safe,"" he said.","Monroe, New York, police say boy, 15, had bomb materials .

"Washington (CNN) -- Dozens of lawmakers support legislation that would set up a more streamlined system for matching Haitian orphans with families in the United States, a U.S. senator said Tuesday. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, said that the initial focus of the legislation would be on children orphaned by the January 12 earthquake in Haiti but that in the long term, it also would address other adoption efforts. She and other senators will press this week to get the Families for Orphans Act out of a Senate committee so it can go to the floor for a vote, she said at a news conference. The bill would set up a separate office in the State Department to handle adoption issues, similar to the office that handles human trafficking, Landrieu said. The office would focus on the issues of orphans and adoptions. ""The old regular process, the old regular bureaucracy, is not going to work,"" she said. Find loved ones in Haiti | Share your story . Gordon Duguid, deputy spokesman for the State Department, said there are about 1,200 pending adoption cases. The department says that 497 orphans have come to the United States since the January 12 earthquake and have been united with their adoptive parents. That number includes 100 orphans who arrived Tuesday, Duguid said. ""We will continue to work until we get through all pending cases,"" he said. ""But we will send no child out of Haiti who does not have cleared, vetted and accepted parents waiting for him or her in the U.S."" An exception will be made if a child needs urgent medical attention or has some other dire problem, he said. ""We are determined to thwart traffickers and are not processing new applications for adoptions,"" he added. Last week, the State Department said it was working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Haitian government to process nearly 300 cases of Americans who were waiting to adopt Haitian children. Of those, 200 cases were being accelerated, the agency said. The department said that some of those orphans are eligible to come to the United States under a humanitarian waiver, unless they can be issued permanent papers. Before the quake, 380,000 children in Haiti were classified as orphans, Landrieu said, quoting figures from the United Nations, which defines an orphan as someone who has lost one parent. The first priority, she said, is to reunite a child with its family, or to find other relatives or a family in Haiti willing to adopt the child. On Tuesday, the State Department said 497 Haitian orphans had been evacuated to the United States since the quake. Sen. Kit Bond, R-Missouri said the red tape in Washington shouldn't slow down the adoption process for Haitian children. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, agreed. ""We have to have a better process here. These are extraordinary circumstances,"" she said. Last week, 14 orphans heading to Pennsylvania weren't allowed to leave Haiti because they had no papers, said Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Pennsylvania, who had gone to Haiti to accompany the group to the United States. The paperwork was lost in the quake, he added. Finally, with intervention from several agencies and the White House, the U.S. Embassy approved humanitarian waivers, or paroles, for the children. Several senators at the briefing mentioned the need to keep children safe from human trafficking while they are awaiting travel or in transit. Their concerns echoed those expressed by charities, aid groups and Haitian officials in recent days. ""We know there have been reports that children left the country without going through the authorization of the prime minister or other authorities,"" Julie Bergeron, chief of child protection for the United Nations Children's Fund, said Sunday. ""We have such reports. We are trying to discuss with different authorities to find a solution to prevent trafficking of children. ... ""But it's very difficult to have the overall picture at the moment. It's overwhelming particularly because there is no registration system. So now that is what we are trying to do: have registration of children so that we have a better idea,"" Bergeron said. According to Haiti's minister of communication, Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lessgue, ""The Haitian government is very clear on this. We are facilitating all of the adoption applications already submitted. Other than those, no child will be leaving the country for adoption, only those whose applications are already on file."" Cinzia Angotti, a child protection officer for the U.N. Peacekeeping Mission to Haiti, said workers are trying to identify the children at risk, ""the ones who are along without family, and to respond as quickly as possible to the lack of protection of children during this disaster."" Groups including Save the Children and World Vision have called for a halt to adoptions, saying that many children who may appear to be orphaned have simply been separated from their families.","Lawmaker says new system would ease adoptions by U.S. families .

"(CNN) -- More than half a century of hostility between the United States and Cuba has done nothing to diminish the island's love of America's national pastime. So it came as no surprise Wednesday when Major League Baseball tweeted that it was ""closely monitoring"" President Barack Obama's historic plans to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba and ease economic restrictions on the nation. ""While there are not sufficient details to make a realistic evaluation, we will continue to track this significant issue, and we will keep our Clubs informed if this different direction may impact the manner in which they conduct business on issues related to Cuba,"" MLB said in the statement. But observers say don't expect an immediate influx of Cuban talent in the big leagues. Not yet, at least. When the 2014 season opened, 19 players born in Cuba were listed on MLB rosters. The island nation was third after the Dominican Republic with 83 players born there and Venezuela with 59. For Cuba, the 19 players was a record high and surpassed the record set in 2013 with 15 players. ""Year after year, an ideological and economic barrier hardened between our two countries,"" Obama told the nation. ""Meanwhile, the Cuban exile community in the United States made enormous contributions to our country, in politics, in business, culture and sports."" Take recent arrival Jose Abreu, the 27-year-old Cienfuegos-born first baseman for the Chicago White Sox. Abreu was voted the American League Rookie of the Year this season, batting .317 with 36 home runs, 107 RBI and .581 slugging percentage. And there's Yoenis Cespedes, 29, the shotgun-armed leftfielder with the Detroit Tigers, who batted .260 with 22 homers and 100 RBI; Los Angeles Dodgers rightfielder Yasiel Puig, 24, who hit .296 with 16 home runs and 69 RBI; and Cincinnati Reds closer Aroldis Chapman, 26, who posted 36 saves with 106 strikeouts, a 2.00 ERA and brushed back batters with 100-mph fastballs. ""This could absolutely have an impact on the game,"" Doug Eldridge, managing partner and sports agent at the DLE Agency, said of the change in Cuba policy. ""There is such a strong Hispanic presence in the MLB and some of the biggest stars in today's game are Cuban."" Bells ring in Havana, anger erupts in Miami . For decades, Cuban players who dreamed of playing in MLB had to defect from the island. Some left their squads while traveling abroad with a national team, but others risked their lives by depending on smugglers to get them out. Many settled in third countries to avoid the MLB amateur draft and make the most money as free agents. Puig's harrowing escape -- which included hiking through crocodile-infested waters and being held captive by a Mexican trafficking ring that threatened to cut off his arm -- was chronicled by ESPN the Magazine and Los Angeles magazine. A significant shift in U.S. policy could eliminate such perils. ""To say it's a dangerous and shady process is probably an understatement,"" Eldrige said. ""This could be a more diplomatic approach to becoming a free agent in MLB."" But it's unlikely that Cuba will allow MLB teams to do what the league has long done in the Dominican Republic, where team-sponsored baseball academies recruit and groom prospects from an early age. For a long time, Cuba has considered players who defected traitors. The government is very proud and protective of the homegrown talent it identifies at an early age in state-run baseball academies. Some observers believe Cuba is more likely to adopt a system similar to Japan, where MLB teams pay the player's team for the right to negotiate and sign him. In this case, the player's team would be the Cuban government. That way, the island keeps control of players and pumps a portion of their contracts into Cuba's faltering economy. 9 questions you were embarrassed to ask about the Cuban embargo . Cuba recently started to allow baseball stars to sign with Japanese baseball teams. The government has been in talks with Mexican teams about similar arrangements. The players' contracts and salaries are tightly controlled by the Cuban state. ""The athletes that are able to leave the country now are finished products,"" said Robert Boland, a professor of sports management at New York University. ""They create bidding wars among the teams. If players were free to move and play, we will probably see more ... coming into the market."" Ben Badler, a writer for Baseball America, tweeted: ""Cuba's already leasing players to Japan, tried with Mexico. Small change compared to what they would making selling stars to MLB teams."" But arrangements such as those with Japan are unlikely as long as the decades-old U.S. economic embargo against Cuba remains in place. Ted Henken, a Cuba expert at New York's Baruch College, said the apparent thawing of relations increases the prospects for Cuban talent in the big leagues, ""but a lot more must change both in Cuba and the U.S. for that to happen.""

But that's not stopping analysts and officials from making some informed guesses about what's going on. Why is North Korea planning to conduct a nuclear test? The North says the ""higher level"" test is part of its military deterrent in its confrontation with the United States, which it describes as ""the sworn enemy of the Korean people."" Its declaration that it would carry out the test came just two days after the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of imposing broader sanctions on the regime in response to Pyongyang's long-range rocket launch in December that was widely viewed as a test of ballistic missile technology. The pattern of events is similar to the lead-up to the previous nuclear tests North Korea carried out in 2006 and 2009. Kim Jong Un appears likely to shrug off pressure from most of the international community, including North Korea's main ally, China, and go ahead with a third test. ""Neither the prospect of stronger sanctions, nor the growing discontent of Russia and China with his behavior, appears to deter North Korea's young leader,"" George Lopez, professor of peace studies at the Kroc Institute, University of Notre Dame, wrote in an opinion article this week for CNN. Under the North's power-driven ideology of songun, or ""military first,"" the punishment meted out last month by the U.N. Security Council requires a strong response, according to Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst for the International Crisis Group covering Northeast Asia. North Korea ""sees international law, international institutions, collective security, arms control and any other cooperative arrangement as undesirable and as schemes to undermine their national security,"" Pinkston said in a recent blog post. A new test will also give North Korea a chance to underscore advances in its nuclear program, potentially moving it closer to a nuclear weapon that it can mount on a long-range missile. ""To make its nuclear arsenal more menacing and provide the deterrent power Pyongyang's vitriolic pronouncements are aimed to achieve, North Korea must demonstrate that it can deliver the weapons on missiles at a distance,"" Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University professor who has visited North Korean nuclear facilities, wrote in an article for Foreign Policy this week. When is it likely to happen? Given that North Korea is one of the most isolated, secretive regimes on the planet, one that views much of the rest of the world with suspicion, getting a clear idea of what exactly it plans to do when is often far from straightforward. Its announcement last month that it would go ahead with a nuclear test didn't provide a time-frame, so analysts and government officials around the globe are interpreting satellite images of the test zone and parsing the language in state media reports for clues. Most of them agree that North Korea is technically ready and could carry out a test at any time. The question is when the top leaders in Pyongyang will give the political green light to go ahead with a move that is likely to further sour relations with the country's Asian neighbors and the United States. ""I think by their political calculations, this is where they're going to have, so to say, the most bang for the buck and make it most effective for what they want to try to accomplish,"" said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, a U.S.-based foundation that seeks to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Yun said this week that North Korea's recent statements suggest a test is ""imminent."" North Korea on Google Maps: Monuments, nuclear complex, gulags . How will other countries know if it has happened? The test is expected to take place underground at the North's Punggye-ri nuclear facility, and the first indications that a test has taken place are likely to show up on earthquake-monitoring equipment. The area around Punggye-ri has little or no history of earthquakes or natural seismic hazards, according to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps. But the previous test, in 2009, registered as a seismic event with a magnitude between 4 and 5. Besides earthquake-monitoring organizations like the USGS, the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna, has a network of seismic, sonar and radiation instruments designed to pick up nuclear tests. It also has sensors that can detect gases that may leak into the atmosphere from the explosion. But determining the sophistication of the nuclear device, and what kind of material -- plutonium or uranium -- was used, will be considerably more difficult, experts say. At some point, North Korea is likely to announce that the explosion has taken place. ""Pyongyang will almost certainly claim that the test was successful and will tout its sophistication. It will be difficult to distinguish truth from propaganda, but experience shows there is often a nugget of truth in North Korea's claims,""  Stanford's Hecker says. South Koreans cast wary eyes to the North . What stage will North Korea's nuclear weapons program be at following a new test? With hard facts about the test so scarce, analysts are busy theorizing what exactly North Korea means when it says the test will be of a ""higher level."" There is a widespread expectation that it will involve the use of highly enriched uranium, whereas the country's two previous tests are understood to have involved plutonium-based devices. ""A successful uranium test indicates that Pyongyang has advanced centrifuge technologies and related support systems,"" Notre Dame's Lopez said. ""It means that North Korea, if left unchecked, can both produce and export such material."" In an article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last year, Hecker and another analyst, Frank Pabian, speculated that North Korea could test two devices at the same time, one using plutonium and the other uranium. ""Two detonations will yield much more technical information than one, and they will be no more damaging politically than if North Korea conducted a single test,"" they wrote. Some observers have even suggested that Pyongyang could make an early attempt at testing a thermonuclear device, which uses nuclear fusion to create a more powerful explosion. But others say they don't believe the North has that ability within its grasp yet. In any case, the test is expected to take North Korea closer to having a nuclear weapon it can direct at its enemies. But actually achieving that goal still remains a longer-term effort, according to Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund. ""I still think we're years away from North Korea having a capability to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile even to a country as close as Japan or South Korea,"" Cirincione said recently. ""And they're even further away from having a long-range missile that could hit the United States."" What are the consequences likely to be? The region is already braced for the test to take place, and countries like the United States, South Korea and Japan are already preparing their response. John Kerry, the new U.S. Secretary of State, spoke to his counterparts in Tokyo and Seoul by phone on Sunday, and all of three of them agreed that the North must understand ""that it will face significant consequences from the international community if it continues its provocative behavior,"" according to a summary of the calls from the U.S. State Department . A push for fresh condemnation and sanctions from the U.N. Security Council is likely, but whether or not the new measures have much bite depends on China. In the event of a new nuclear test, Beijing is likely ""reduce its assistance to North Korea,"" the the state-run Chinese newspaper Global Times said in an editorial last month. But it added that ""if the U.S., Japan and South Korea promote extreme U.N. sanctions on North Korea, China will resolutely stop them and force them to amend these draft resolutions."" Fundamentally, analysts say, a new test won't upend the geopolitical situation in Northeast Asia. But it will seriously harm the chances of any meaningful dialog between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington in the near future. ""It will signal that the new regime, like its predecessors, has chosen bombs over electricity"" for its impoverished population, Hecker wrote. Another test also increases concerns about where North Korea's nuclear material will end up in the long term, either because it decides to sell it or in the event of a collapse of the regime, according to Yun of the Ploughshares Fund. ""That's something that we really have to be concerned about,"" he said.","North Korea has vowed to carry out a ""higher level"" test .
Experts and officials say it could take place at any time .
Opinions vary on exactly what kind of test it may carry out .
Another nuclear test is likely to further strain relations in East Asia ."
"A high-altitude avalanche Friday killed 12 Sherpa guides and seriously wounded three in the single deadliest accident on Mount Everest, officials said. Four others are missing, said Madhu Sudan Burlakoti of Nepal's Tourism Ministry, adding that six people were injured in total. A group of about 50 people, mostly Nepali Sherpas, were hit by the avalanche at more than 20,000 feet, said Tilak Ram Pandey of the ministry's mountaineering department. The avalanche took place just above base camp in the Khumbu Ice Fall. The climbers were accounted for, Pandey said. ""Rescue teams have gone ... to look for the missing."" Before Friday, the deadliest single-day toll was from an accident in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared when a huge storm hit. Their tragic story was chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book ""Into Thin Air."" Everest by the numbers . Readying for the climb . Between May 15 and 30 is usually the best window for reaching the 29,028-foot peak. Climbers and guides had been setting the ropes for the route, acclimating to the climate and preparing the camps along the route when the avalanche hit Friday, said Gordon Janow with Alpine Ascents International in Seattle. Climbers arrive in April to acclimate to the altitude before heading toward the summit of the world's highest mountain. Ethnic Sherpas acts as guides for the mostly foreign clients. Busiest season . The spring climbing season is the busiest of the year. About 334 foreign climbers have been given permission to climb Everest over the next couple of months, with an estimated 400 Sherpas helping them, mountaineering official Dipendra Poudel said. Until the late 1970s, only a handful of climbers reached the top each year. The number topped 100 for the first time in 1993. By 2004, it was more than 300. In 2012, the number was more than 500.

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry will immediately send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to help secure the southern border, where tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America have crossed into the United States this year in a surge that is deemed a humanitarian crisis. Perry also wants President Barack Obama and Congress to hire an additional 3,000 border patrol agents for the Texas border, which would eventually replace the temporary guard forces. ""I will not stand idly by,"" Perry said in Austin Monday, announcing what he called Operation Strong Safety. ""The price of inaction is too high."" Perry's state has received the majority of migrant children, especially in the Rio Grande region, and he has repeatedly called on the federal government to beef up border security. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House has not yet received the formal communication required for Perry to deploy guard troops. But he said if Perry follows through, he hopes those forces would be coordinated ""with the significant ongoing efforts already in place."" On border crisis, Jeb Bush, Rubio and Perry remake image . The Rio Grande sector, where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol, has a large number of agents but it is also the largest crossing. It currently has 3,000 border patrol agents covering 320 miles of land and 250 miles of water, which equates to 5.4 agents per mile. The Tucson sector, for instance, has approximately 15.7 agents per mile. Both Perry and Obama have the authority to deploy National Guard troops, but whoever authorizes it has to pay for it. The deployment at Perry's direction means Texas will have to pick up the price tag of $12 million per month. One border sheriff, Omar Lucio of Cameron County, said he is skeptical of Perry's plan. ""At this time, a lot of people do things for political reasons. I don't know that it helps,"" he told the Dallas Morning News. Conservatives largely point to border security as their top immigration priority and Perry has been an outspoken proponent of securing the border since the influx of immigrants began. Is the immigration crisis Rick Perry's second act? The potential 2016 presidential candidate previewed his plan in Iowa over the weekend in a television interview while campaigning for Republican candidates. He has used the issue to remake his image on immigration. His previous White House campaign was crippled partly because of a law he signed giving children of undocumented immigrants in-state college tuition. Obama asked for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to address the influx of young immigrants, which hasn't gained much traction in Congress. It includes money to fortify the border. The House and Senate are working on their own plan, which includes a controversial proposal to change a law that prohibits the youth, mostly from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from being immediately deported. The Obama administration questioned Perry's motives since many of the minors are not trying to evade the border patrol but are turning themselves in after crossing the border. Children at the border: What's happening and why . But Perry said the guard will be ""force multipliers,"" helping Customs and Border Protection agents both on the ground and in the air to catch the 80% of people crossing the border who aren't children and to combat cartel and trafficking crime. ""You cannot have (national security) without border security,"" Perry said. While the number of unaccompanied youth crossing the border has doubled to nearly 60,000 in the past year, the total number of undocumented immigrants has mostly declined. About 1 million people have been caught crossing the border nearly every year between 1983 until 2006, but that number has dropped to about 400,000 in 2013. At the same time, resources for border security have steadily increased: More than 18,000 agents patrolled the border in 2013 compared to 10,000 a decade ago. And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled. The Customs and Border Patrol budget jumped from $5 billion in 2002 to $12.4 billion this year. The issue has hit a national nerve. Protests have erupted along the border with activists demanding immediate deportation. Counter protests have also erupted, pointing out that many of the migrants are said to have fled violence at home. Protesters vent anger at 'alien invasion' of the U.S.","Texas Gov.

"(CNN) -- After being hidden away for years, a copy of the original ""Action Comics No. 1"" comic book, featuring Superman and friends, will make a comeback -- to the tune of about $400,000, a comic expert told CNN Thursday. A Superman Web site features Action Comics covers, including No. 1, at left. Starting Friday, comic book collectors and Superman fans will have the opportunity to bid on a comic classic -- an ""unrestored"" copy of Action Comics No. 1, said Stephen Fishler, owner of Comic Connect, an online liaison between comic book buyers and sellers. The book's owner is not being identified. The auction is attracting a lot of interest. ""One bidder wanted to trade his Ferrari for the comic book,"" as part of an under-the-table deal, Fishler joked. But he said the auction will remain public. ""I couldn't see myself trading in my Toyota Prius"" -- even for a $375,000 car. Why is this comic book so unique? ""Of the 100 existing copies, 80 percent have been restored, but people want an untouched copy,"" Fishler said. The book is listed in ""fine"" condition, a six on the 10-point rating scale. ""It's the Holy Grail of comic books,"" Fishler said. Co-created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the comic book first appeared on newsstands for 10 cents a copy in June 1938. Nearly 12 years later, a young boy on the West Coast found himself in a secondhand book store, where he persuaded his dad to loan him 35 cents to buy the comic book. Until 1966, the owner forgot about the book, which was hidden in his mother's basement. Since then, he's been holding onto it, hoping to see it increase in value, Fishler said. He has not been disappointed. ""There has been a lot of interest shown on the book in the collectibles market,"" said Fishler, who predicted the comic book will sell for about $400,000. But, he added, no minimum price has been set for the auction, so ""whatever it sells for, it sells for. ""I've known Action Comics to sell for around $750,000,"" comic book sales associate Bill Peterson said. ""I don't have any intention on making a bid, but I know people who don't mind dropping several thousand for a classic comic."" The comic book marked the first appearances of Lois Lane, Giovanni ""John"" Zatara and, of course, Superman. The book is in high demand because ""there was no such thing as a superhero before Superman. It spawned everything that came after -- like Batman and Spider-Man,"" Fishler said. Even during the current economic downturn, Fishler expects the book to do well. Those who can afford to bid, he said, ""would ordinarily put money into the stock market. But that's a shaky proposition."" These days, the comic book may even be a better investment than putting money into a CD or a bond, Fishler speculated. iReport.com: Would you give up your prized possession? Because the book was published at the close of the Great Depression, it contains advertisements that may appear quaint and quirky to 21st century readers. For only $1.25, one could buy a blonde wig, a live chameleon, a whoopee cushion, a Bible ""the size of a postage stamp"" and hypnosis lessons.

"(CNN)She's one of the most powerful women in football after cracking one of sports' most notorious glass ceilings, but even Mia Hamm is not immune from the demands of domestic drudgery. ""Sorry for all of the noise,"" she says as the clatter of workmen and screaming kids crackles down the phone line. ""The people who were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago to fix our carpets have just shown up!"" A proud mother of seven-year-old twin girls and a baby boy, Hamm was for the best part of two decades America's foremost footballer. Though the World Cup winner and double Olympic gold medalist -- described as ""the biggest U.S.-born soccer star of all time"" -- is swift to laugh off such lofty titles. ""I'm just a former player that every day has to wake up, get her kids to school and figure out what I'm making them for lunch and dinner,"" the 42-year-old Hamm, who played for the U.S. women's team on over 200 occasions between 1987 and 2004, told CNN. However, it's not just the school run and her kids' packed lunches that Hamm has on her mind these days. Appointed to the board of directors at major Italian club Roma, she occupies a position within the sport that few other women can match. As well as her role in the ""Eternal City,"" the Alabama native is a minority owner of the newly-formed Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) -- which will join Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2017. ""I never stand up there and say 'I'm doing this to get more women in football,'"" says Hamm of her appointment at Roma, which is owned by Italian American investor James Pallotta. ""But I take pride in the fact and I look at it as a great responsibility to make sure I do the best job I can. ""I personally didn't say yes just to tick a box. I think they will soon learn that I have opinions, I have ideas."" Hamm's links to the Italian capital go beyond the boardroom. Her parents lived in the city for over four years when she was younger, with her father -- an Air Force pilot -- working at the U.S. embassy in Rome. That was when Hamm first became aware of the team affectionately known as the ""Giallorossi"" (the yellow-reds). ""It was one of the clubs I could follow on the local TV,"" she explains. ""It was the colors I would see when I would walk around Rome. ""So my holidays, Christmas and a couple of weeks over summer were spent over in Rome. AS Roma was the team I started following then."" Pallotta, who took over Roma in 2012, has grand ambitions for the club that include the construction of a new 52,000-seater stadium for the three-time Italian champions. The Bostonian's vision appealed to Hamm, who hopes to raise the club's international profile -- especially in the U.S. She wants to ensure that ""when people are talking about their favorite teams, AS Roma is one of the teams that comes out of their mouth"" and hopes the club continues its recent trend of touring the U.S. during the European offseason. ""I'd love to be a part of that and helping get the fan support,"" she insists. ""Even though I know there's an incredible fan support here for Roma."" Hamm's own relationship with the game dates back to her childhood when, perhaps surprisingly, she had a hard time convincing her coach to let her play. That coach also happened to be her dad, and the eager Hamm was barely out of diapers. ""I wasn't allowed to play organized soccer until I turned five,"" says Hamm. ""I had an older brother and a sister that were a year apart. They were on the same team and my dad happened to be coaching them. ""I just remember standing on the sidelines, collecting balls for them when they went wide of the goal, hoping my dad would say, 'Hey Mia, do you want to jump in?' ""Those are some of the early memories, hanging out with older siblings, getting beat up by them and their friends at practice but loving it. ""I just wanted to belong to a team."" Eventually her father relented and finally let the precocious ball girl enter the fray. Hamm didn't look back. Her glittering career saw the prolific goalscorer help grow football in the U.S., firstly as the youngest member of the team which won the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991. Olympic glory followed as Hamm added a gold medal to her resume in front of fervent home support at the 1996 Altanta Games. Three years later -- once again on home soil -- Hamm scored in a tense penalty shootout as the U.S. narrowly beat China at the Pasadena Rose Bowl to lift the World Cup for a second time. Fast forward to Athens 2004 and she became a double Olympic champion, having added a silver medal to her collection of precious metals at the 2000 Games in Sydney. Hamm's experiences within such successful teams had a profound effect on her as she grew in confidence, learned how to work with others, while also boosting her self-esteem. Above all, she learned how to handle failure. ""We have two daughters of our own who are about seven and a half and I just see the excitement,"" she explains, ""the lessons that they are learning every single time they go out there. ""It's no surprise to me. You look across the board, not just with female athletes but with Fortune 500 companies, and women that are in top executive positions all played some kind of sports growing up. They talk about the empowerment they felt. ""Getting kids up and motivated and then all of the wonderful things they experience and learn through sport are so important. Much more than you would ever get sat in front of your TV."" As well as her Roma role, Hamm is part of a band of celebrities who have signed up as minority owners of LAFC, a new team hoping to act as rivals to Los Angeles Galaxy, which won its fifth championship in 2014. NBA legend ""Magic"" Johnson and Hamm's husband Nomar Garciaparra, a former pro baseball player, are both part of a star-spangled ownership team. The continued expansion of MLS -- which commissioner Don Garber hopes will swell to 24 teams by 2020 -- is proof of soccer's growing popularity in the U.S., with women forming part of the professional ranks. Formed in 2013, the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) allows eight teams to vie for domestic glory, a welcome development following multiple false starts for the female game in America, the most recent setback arriving when Women's Professional Soccer ceased operations in 2012. Although the country also boasts the Women's Premier Soccer League -- which houses both professional and amateur teams -- Hamm hopes the NWSL can cement itself on the nation's sporting landscape. ""The success of the MLS will help the NWSL,"" insists Hamm. ""The success of the U.S. national teams will help the NWSL. ""There are several teams that are tied to MLS clubs and that could be the potential for the future where we're able to share facilities, share infrastructure."" So when LAFC enters the league, will it also boast a women's team? ""Don't know yet,"" says a candid Hamm. ""For me, it just makes sense, in one of the largest hotbed of girls' club soccer in the country, if not the world. ""Being a part of the ownership group, we have a lot of work ahead of us. The women's team isn't their first priority, but I want it to be in the conversation. ""I'm going to make sure it's something that's discussed consistently because it's the right thing to do and this area will support it. There are so many talented players in this area, up and down the coast."" As far as Hamm is concerned, the future of U.S. soccer is bright -- regardless of gender. ""I'm always hopeful, I love the game too much,"" she says. ""It doesn't mean I'm naive, but I want the game to succeed in this country and the women's side is a huge part of that.""","Mia Hamm won World Cups and Olympic medals with the U.S. women's soccer team .

"""We are like one grain of sand against a whole beach."" Eibar fan Unai Eraso. SD Eibar has already climbed one mountain this summer in being admitted to Spain's top football tier, but its next task is even more daunting -- trying to compete in the same division as European champion Real Madrid. Not only can Real lavish a sum four times Eibar's annual budget on just one player, its Bernabeu stadium could hold the entire population of the tiny Basque town and still have 58,454 seats empty. Eibar will be the smallest team ever to compete in La Liga and had to raise $2.3 million in capital just to take its place at the top table of Spanish football. Its president Alex Aranzaba believes the greatest achievement in Eibar's history would be to survive on such an uneven playing field. ""There are several reasons why Real Madrid and Barcelona are so far ahead in terms of finance,"" Aranzabal told CNN. ""Both clubs have many connections around the world and don't earn money by just selling tickets -- they have big merchandising campaign. ""There's also the huge television deals which they both have. It's impossible to compete with them, not just for Eibar which is the smallest team, but even for bigger clubs like Sevilla, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao. That Eibar will go head-to-head with the likes of Real Madird and Barca l is something of a sporting miracle. After gaining promotion to Spain's second tier, the club promptly won the title for the first in its history. But a debut season rubbing shoulders with the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and champions Atletico was immediately under threat, due to a 1999 law passed down by the Spanish authorities. It insists each team must have a capital equal to 25% of the average expenses of all sides in the second division, excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest. The law is designed to ensure all clubs can attend to its debts, despite La Liga's leading lights -- Real Madrid and Barca -- being in the red to an estimated combined total close to €1 billion ($1.36 billion). Eibar, on the other hand, are self-sustaining and completely debt free; even La Liga's president has referred to them as a ""model club."" And yet, failure to raise the required €1.7 million ($2.3 million) would result in demotion back to the obscurity of Spain's third tier. But football loves an underdog and when Eibar threw themselves at the mercy of fans by launching a share issue scheme, thousands stepped forward to help. The cash was raised a full three weeks before Eibar's deadline, leaving Aranzabal and others at the club dumbfounded at the pledges of support. ""For a small city and a small club to receive such support from across the world is something that makes me very proud -- it feels like we're part of a family,"" said Aranzabal. ""At the beginning there were some doubts we'd raise the money, but later we realized we had a story to tell and that we could reach our target with hard work. ""Around 36% of our shareholders are from Eibar but because of the online marketing campaign we have shareholders from 50 different countries across the world. ""We had people buying shares from the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Germany, France, Mexico, Colombia. We had people coming to us from all over Asia and across the world. ""It really has been incredible."" With the financial hurdles overcome, Eibar's fans can now dream of the footballing treats that lie ahead. Barcelona and Real Madrid will visit Eibar's titchy Ipurua stadium (capacity 5,900) in due course, but first up are neighbors Real Sociedad for a Basque derby on Sunday. ""This club was founded in 1940 after the troubles of the Civil War,"" added Aranzabal, referring to the conflict that tore Spain apart. ""This is the first time in 74 years and this is a dream. Now we have to maintain the dream in La Liga. We're sure that we're going to be competitive and fight until the last minute of the season to avoid relegation. ""This club is used to facing challenges."" Unai Eraso has been a supporters of Eibar all his life and is in no doubt the last year qualifies as a bona fide sporting miracle. ""You can't even compare Eibar with Barcelona or Real Madrid,"" said Eraso. ""The population of Eibar is 27,000 people, against Real Madrid in a city of more than 3.5 million people. ""Everyone is bigger in terms of budget, population, stadium, players but our story is going to be a good one for football as a whole. ""It will be tough on the pitch but I'm really confident because we have no pressure on us. This year is a like a present to all the supporters of Eibar. ""Nobody's going to whistle or shout against the team or the players. We are Eibar -- we know who we are."" Like Aranzabal, Eraso believes Spanish football needs to redistribute its wealth better. Though Eibar raised the cash it needed to lift its head above the financial bar imposed by the league, it's still dwarfed by almost all its fellow La Liga clubs. Eibar's budget for the season is around the same as Barcelona star Lionel Messi will earn in wages over the same period. That's partly because Spanish clubs are allowed to sell its television rights independently, meaning the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona could command four times the amount that Eibar can muster. ""It is not fair at all,"" Eraso said. ""Not only in how the TV money is shared among the teams but also the huge amount of money some clubs owe. Eibar has no debt at all. ""These guys are free to buy a lot of players with the money they get from TV and it makes for a paralyzed league where the top two or three teams have 80% of the resources and the rest have peanuts. ""In Spain it is a nonsense to say someone outside of Real Madrid, Atletico or Barcelona will win the league. There is no fourth candidate."" Eibar isn't concerned with the title race though -- its battle is to finish fourth from bottom and avoid relegation. Eraso is convinced they can do it, if they harness the intimidating surrounds of Ipurua, and call on the famed togetherness in the town. ""The spirit is the most important thing that will help us overcome all the challenges we will have this year,"" he said. ""We have overcome a lot of crises in the town and reinvented ourselves. We now have to adapt to what is coming this year. ""We're going to have the lowest budget with no big names in our team but we will make it with the players and all of us pushing in the same direction -- this is in our spirit.""","Tiny SD Eibar set to play first ever match in Spain's top tier on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- This is how the world ends -- at least at the multiplex this month. Last weekend's box-office champ ""2012"" primarily uses an ancient Mayan prophecy to spin a tale of world destruction. ""The Road,"" due out November 25, showcases a father and son navigating a post-apocalyptic world of ash, cold and cannibals. And the indie documentary ""Collapse"" gives voice to one man's belief that, as we exhaust natural resources, civilization is ready to crumble. Such concerns have always been with us, says Alexander Riley, a sociology professor at Bucknell University who's incorporated eschatology (the study of the end times) into his courses. ""It's been a constant part of the landscape in the Western world for a long time,"" he says, though it's been particularly present in recent times, perhaps driven by ever-quickening social and technological change, he adds. Examples can be found through the centuries. At the end of the year 999, pilgrims made their way to Jerusalem, convinced that the Last Judgment was at hand. In 1843, thousands of followers of the religious leader William Miller gathered on New England hilltops, waiting for ascension. In 1982, some believed the ""Jupiter Effect"" -- the rough alignment of several celestial bodies -- would cause catastrophe. And the coming of the year 2000 led to fears about technological collapse -- in the form of the Y2K bug -- and rumblings about the return of Jesus. The fact that none of these events led to the end of the world hasn't calmed end-times fears. Indeed, many people are still trying to interpret alleged prophecies -- such as the biblical Book of Revelation, Nostradamus' verses and that 2012-focused Mayan Long Count calendar -- in hopes of figuring out exactly when the other shoe will drop, and humanity will be freed from its vale of tears. Riley observes that end-times passions find particularly fertile soil in the United States, which has a higher degree of religiosity compared to other developed nations, according to a 2008 Gallup survey. At the evangelical Friends Church in Yorba Linda, California -- one of the largest Quaker churches in the world -- Phil Hotsenpiller, the church's teaching pastor, gives a yearly series of lectures on end-times concepts and says interest has been high, with ""lines out the door."" He says that he tries to educate his audience about the sources of apocalyptic thought, and why biblical prophecy is such a draw for some. ""Biblical prophecy lays out a scenario that God says this is what's going to happen, and just watch for these signs,"" he says. The movie business has taken notice: The Weinstein Company, producers of ""The Road,"" asked Hotsenpiller to take his show on, well, the road to discuss themes of the film. But it's not just Christian groups that have an end-times fascination. Riley says that all the major monotheistic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- have variations on the belief that God interacts directly with humanity, and has made a promise ""to wrap things up, and then we'll get on with Act Two."" That idea of an Act Two -- or, better yet, a conclusion -- satisfies something innate in humans, he says. ""Lots of people have an interest in cultural narratives ... that have a closure that coincides to some degree with their own lives,"" Riley says. Science provides a story as well, he says, ""but it's very open-ended."" The eschatological narrative, on the other hand, says ""the world is going to come to an end, and it's likely going to come to an end in my lifetime. So conveniently, everything is going to wrap up when or before MY life wraps up."" Which is where Hollywood, longtime manufacturer of great stories and seeker of customer satisfaction, comes in. iReporter: See ""2012"" in theatres . Movie history is replete with end-of-the-world scenarios, whether driven by religion (""The Seventh Sign""), alien invasion (""Mars Attacks!""), environmental disaster (""The Day After Tomorrow""), warfare (""Dr. Strangelove"") or much of the above (""Beneath the Planet of the Apes""). Wheeler Winston Dixon, Ryan Professor of Film Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, points out that the topic is almost as old as film itself: The first sound film of Abel Gance, who made the groundbreaking 1927 silent ""Napoleon,"" was 1931's ""The End of the World,"" in which a comet slams into Earth. (It flopped.) Such films allow us to enjoy the present while watching a fantasy about the future, he says. ""I think it's a desire to sort of say ... 'We won't have to worry about the future, because there is no future,' "" he says. ""And so therefore, we can do what we want now, and all the debts are put off and all the responsibilities are avoided."" Besides, ""the complete destruction of the world has always been attractive, because ... by witnessing that act and staying outside of it, you've witnessed the apocalypse,"" he says. ""It's much like a horror movie. It allows you to participate without risk."" ""We love adrenaline,"" adds Peter Hankoff, a writer-producer of documentaries for the National Geographic Channel and the Discovery Channel, among others. ""We always have this need to be vigilant or hypervigilant. So when something like this comes on our radar of the possibility of the end, it peaks our adrenaline level. ... We love disaster, and we love to avert it."" But Hankoff, a pleasurably acerbic skeptic who has made documentaries about Nostradamus, says it's hard to persuade people invested in end-times theories to revise their views. ""The problem is, when you're faced with the facts, and faced with finding real concrete proof ... 2 plus 2 equals 4, no matter how many times you add it up."" Believing in the end offers power to the dispossessed, he adds: ""[If] there's this level of feeling of insignificance, what's the greatest equalizer in the world? The end of the world."" iReporter: ""2012"" good, not great . Sometimes, the fixation can lead to tragedy. In 1995, members of the Japanese group Aum Shinrikyo released sarin nerve gas into the Tokyo subway system, killing 12 people. Two years later, members of the Heaven's Gate cult committed suicide in the belief that a spaceship was going to come and take them off earth. And many terrorists and agitators subscribe to end-times beliefs, with hope that their provocations can lead to apocalypse. Still, as optimists are fond of pointing out, ""apocalypse"" doesn't mean end, but is Greek for ""revelation"" -- an unveiling of truth. In that respect, says Hotsenpiller, a concern about the end can lead to a desire to fix things: hope that we, as humans, can make a positive impact. ""All of us deep down know that something's wrong with the world and with us as people,"" he says. ""There is something wired into us, or placed in there by God, that says, 'Every one of you is going to have to deal with the issues that ... aren't right in your life.' That doesn't have to be a negative. It can be a positive. It can be where I come to grips with who I am as a person, with who I am before God, and I make some changes."" And for those who are still convinced that 2012 means the collapse of civilization, Hankoff -- who doesn't buy it for a minute (though he can't wait to see the movie) -- is pleased to offer a solution. ""I want everybody that believes that 2012 is going to happen to send me their stuff,"" he says. ""And if you get mad at me for saying that 2012 is totally insane, you can send me an apology on December 22, 2012 -- which is a Saturday, by the way -- because I'm still going to be here.""","Movies about end of the world particularly present in recent times .

"New York (CNN) -- Days after a monster blizzard blanketed much of the northeastern U.S., New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he will investigate whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed cleanup efforts over frustrations regarding citywide budget cuts. ""It would be an outrage if it took place,"" Bloomberg said Thursday, stressing that his administration's primary focus is clearing streets in the city's outer boroughs. Some neighborhoods remained snowbound for days after the storm. Rumors swirled across New York on Thursday that sanitation officers ordered rank-and-file workers to slow down cleanup efforts in retaliation for the city's belt-tightening measures. City councilman Dan Halloran said three sanitation workers and two Department of Transportation supervisors came to his office saying their supervisors ordered the slowdown, telling workers ""The mayor will see how much he needs us"" and that ""there will be plenty of overtime."" Bloomberg said that budget cuts had not yet taken effect, but defended them, saying ""the state is facing a budget deficit that's going to filter down to us."" The slow cleanup effort hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. By Thursday, snow plows had reached nearly every street in the city, Bloomberg said. The head of New York's sanitation workers' union, Harry Nespoli, said he was not aware of any slowdown and doubts there was a protest by workers. Nespoli said ""it was one of the biggest blizzards I've ever seen,"" with wind conditions that severely reduced drivers' visibility and hampered cleanup efforts. He had earlier blamed harsh winds and budget cuts as reasons for the slow response. ""We were 400 people short,"" said Nespoli, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association. ""There are certain services that should not be affected. The people pay taxes for it."" New York's Sanitation Officers Association on Thursday posted comments denying allegations of a slowdown. ""When look around your neighborhood and wonder what the heck happened with the City's snow fighting ability you don't have to look any further than City Hall,"" the website said. Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty also said he had not seen evidence of a worker protest. ""But we have to look into that,"" he said. Outgoing New York Gov. David Paterson has also weighed in, saying it would be a ""very, very serious breach"" if the accusations are accurate. Paterson called for an investigation Thursday.","NEW: Sanitation Officers Association denies allegations of a worker slowdown .

"(CNN) -- ""All around me my friends were lying injured and dead."" These are not the confessions of a battle-hardened soldier who signed up to fight in his nation's war. They are the words of a 15-year-old boy lying in a hospital bed in Peshawar, Pakistan, after Taliban militants attacked his school in an act of savagery so bloody and brazen it seized the attention of a world grown nearly indifferent to the barbarism vying regularly for its attention. At a time of playground bombings in Syria, kidnapped schoolgirls in Nigeria, girls' schools shuttered under threat in Afghanistan and conflicts descending into chaos in real time, the attack on the Pakistan's Army Public School brought home once again the danger children face simply for the act of heading to school. Are we ready to watch schools become the new front lines? It is a question we all must answer. The Peshawar attack was not a one-off. It was simply larger and even more horrific than previous carnage. ""In 2013, 78 attacks against schools, teachers and schoolchildren were reported to the United Nations in Pakistan,"" a news release from the U.N.'s special representative for children and armed conflict noted. This morning, condemnations poured in, including one from a global leader who knows firsthand such deadly violence. ""I condemn these atrocious and cowardly acts,"" Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai said in a statement. Two years ago, the Taliban shot the Pakistani teenager at close range on her school bus in retaliation for her eloquent advocacy for girls' education in Swat Valley in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; its capital is Peshawar, site of Tuesday's attack. Nor is the violence new. Armed conflict increasingly has made the world's children its front lines. In a wrenching interview, a girl named Margaret tells of being abducted from her girls' school in northern Uganda in 2004 at 14 by soldiers for Joseph Kony. She was forced to become his sex slave and to bear his children, one of countless children forced into soldiering and slavery by Kony's Lord's Resistance Army. As schools become battlefields, the need to protect them has never been greater. Indeed, education is one of the most potent weapons in the fight for global stability and security. Another Nobel Prize winner, economist Amartya Sen, has written that there is no clearer route to economic development and, ultimately, to peace than education. In 2011, 57 million children were out of school; half of them in countries that are home to armed conflict. And that should concern everyone who wants to see a world that is stable, peaceful and secure. And yet, today in Syria millions of refugee children remain out of school. A ""No Lost Generation"" campaign to fund education and support for these children is under way but remains vastly underfunded. ""Before the war, almost all of Syria's children were enrolled in school,"" according to the charity Save the Children. Today, ""Syria now has the second worst enrollment rate in the world with almost 3 million school-aged Syrian children no longer in school."" At an event in September hosted by U.N. Education Envoy Gordon Brown, frustration was palpable. Everyone agreed that education was key to guaranteeing that millions of Syrian children had a chance at a future. But getting the world to open up its wallet when it came to keeping them in any kind of classroom has proved more challenging. One of the people fighting for that safer world is Beatrice Ayuru Byaruhanga, founder of the Lira Integrated School in once violence-riddled northern Uganda. Herself a groundbreaker -- as a woman who graduated from college -- Ayuru grew and sold cassava to fund a school that would fight illiteracy and poverty and battle for the rights of children to stay in the classroom. ""During the war, we would always run with the children from school to the town to hide them,"" Ayuru told a reporter. ""Then, during the day we collected them from town again to come and have lessons."" Ayuru would not be cowed by the violence around her. Nor would Malala Yousafzai. ""I, along with millions of others around the world, mourn these children, my brothers and sisters -- but we will never be defeated,"" Yousafzai said in her statement. That resolve will be required for the fight ahead. The militants have shown they will stop at nothing to take the fight to the Pakistani Army. And they have made clear the stakes. Those who care about the future not just of their own children, but the stability and prosperity of the world they will inherit, must agree that the world needs a lot more Malalas and Beatrice Ayurus if there are to be fewer blood-soaked days like today. And they must fund, support and speak out for the right of every child to have a classroom that does not double as a battle zone. It is a shared fight. And one in which we all have a stake.","Gayle Lemmon: Peshawar attack wasn't a one-off; schools have been targeted often .
She says the bloody, brazen attack has seized the world's attention .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has again cast aside an appeal that raised doubts about President Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship, a grass-roots legal issue that has gained little legal or political footing, but continues to persist in the courts. The justices without comment Monday rejected a challenge from Charles Kerchner Jr., a Pennsylvania man who sought a trial in federal court forcing the president to produce documents regarding his birth and citizenship. Kerchner's attorney, Mario Apuzzo, had argued in a petition with the Supreme Court that Obama did not fit the definition of a ""natural-born citizen"" required for the nation's highest office, as defined by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. That clause states, ""No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States."" Kerchner, a retired military officer who describes himself on his website as a ""genetic genealogy pioneer,"" argues the framers of the 1789 document intended a ""natural-born"" citizen to mean someone born in the U.S. to parents who were both American citizens. The high court and other courts had dismissed earlier, unrelated lawsuits from individuals questioning Obama's citizenship. State birth certificate records show he was born August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii. His mother is a native of Kansas; his father was born in Kenya, which at the time was a British colony. ""A person gains allegiance and loyalty and therefore attachment for a nation from either being born on the soil of the community defining that nation or from being born to parents who were also born on that same soil or who naturalized as though they were born on that soil,"" said Apuzzo. ""It is only by combining at birth in the child both means to inherit these two sources of citizenship that the child by nature and therefore also by law is born with only one allegiance and loyalty to and consequently attachment for only the United States."" He said it was ""undisputed fact"" Obama's father was a citizen of the British crown. The Obama administration did not file, and the high court did not demand, a formal government response to this latest legal claim. The high court will often insist the Justice Department weigh in with its views on a particular constitutional issue, or when it is being sued, and that is a sign the justices are seriously considering accepting the appeal. Obama and his staff produced copies of his birth certificate when he was running for president in 2008, and have previously dismissed questions over his citizenship. Other legal claims on the citizenship question whether Obama was in fact born in the United States, and whether his birth documents are authentic. Among the issues the high court has refused to fully address in these appeals involves ""standing,"" whether individual Americans can bring such a lawsuit, by first establishing personal, direct ""harm"" or ""injury"" from having Obama occupy the White House. Overcoming that legal hurdle would allow such suits to proceed on the merits in courts. Some of the claims of various ""birther"" movement organizers insist the president was born in Kenya or Indonesia; that his birth certificate is a forgery; and that he had dual American-British citizenship at birth because of his father's Kenyan heritage and therefore is not a ""natural born"" citizen. The case is Kerchner v. Obama (10-446).","The Supreme Court rejects latest appeal without comment .

"Have no fear, Vladimir Putin is here. That seems to be the message in an epic promo released ahead of the Russian president's annual news conference as the country's economy plummets.

He declares in a particularly memorable sound bite: ""The bear never asks permission."" That seems to be a problem these days in Russia -- it's a bear, not a bull market. Putin who has held power for 15 years, is expected to address the economic problems vexing Russia as falling oil prices, a diving ruble and Western sanctions have crippled the country's economy.

Yet in the lead up to Putin's press conference, Russia Channel 1's glossy promo doesn't touch on any of the financial woes facing the world's ninth largest economy.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Chicago authorities asked Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to issue a disaster declaration after rainfall Saturday in the Windy City broke a single-day record that had stood for more than two decades. Chicago received more than 6 inches of rain Saturday, breaking a 1987 record. The deluge flooded streets and stranded residents in their homes. Officials worked to rescue people Sunday as the city grappled with another day of drenching. O'Hare International Airport recorded 6.64 inches of rain Saturday -- breaking the all-time record of 6.49 inches set in 1987, according to the National Weather Service. Records have been kept since 1871. By 4:30 a.m. CT on Sunday, emergency management and law enforcement officials were reporting widespread flooding across much of northern Illinois and extreme northwest Indiana, with rainfall totals of 4 to 7 inches in certain areas, the weather service said. Commissioner John Spatz of Chicago's Department of Water Management said the north branch of the Chicago River ""rose quickly and began to flow down the 5000 block of North Monticello,"" causing flooding northward and southward.  Watch how Chicago flooded before Ike's rains arrived » . In the worst-hit area, Albany Park, about 340 homes were in danger. About 40 residents were evacuated -- some of them by boat -- and taken to a shelter. About 90 billion gallons of water fell on the city's water district, authorities said. More than 20 water department crews were out, and widespread sandbagging operations were under way. Spatz said the city's sewer system was still ""working well."" City officials said that, in general, things were under control. Saturday's pounding rain was not related to Hurricane Ike. Remnants of Tropical Storm Lowell, which had come in from the Pacific, got caught up with a cold front, sending a wave of moisture into the region. But on Sunday, as the remnants of Ike -- by then a tropical depression -- worked their way farther into the country's heartland, heavy rain was expected over much of the region, including Illinois. On Sunday morning, the National Hurricane Center said flood and flash-flood watches were in effect for much of the state. But police reported no major incidents.","Records kept since 1871 say Saturday's rain marks worst in more than century .

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan opposition leaders received a major morale boost Friday when a top U.S. senator made a surprise visit to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and urged greater American involvement in the bloody campaign to oust strongman Moammar Gadhafi. The visit from Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, came a day after the United States said it was deploying predator drones to Libya. McCain said the drones would increase NATO's capability in the war-torn North African country, but not enough to make up a shortfall in assets needed to break a ""significant degree of stalemate."" He said he was against U.S. troops on the ground -- echoing Obama administration policy -- but argued that Western powers need to do more to ""facilitate"" the delivery of weapons and training for the rebels. ""We have prevented the worst outcome in Libya,"" McCain told reporters. ""Now we need to increase our support so that the Libyan people can achieve the only satisfactory outcome to this mass protest for universal rights -- the end of Gadhafi's rule and the beginning of a peaceful and inclusive transition to democracy that will benefit all Libyans."" McCain, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, is a former presidential nominee and decorated Navy veteran. The five-term senator is considered a senior congressional spokesman on military and foreign policy matters. McCain is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Libya since the conflict erupted in February. During his visit, he challenged critics of NATO's intervention to tour Benghazi and see a ""powerful and hopeful example of what a free Libya can be."" The senator was greeted by a crowd of roughly 100 Libyans waving American flags. ""Thank you John McCain! Thank you Obama,"" people chanted. ""Thank you America! We need freedom! Gadhafi go away!"" McCain visited Benghazi's Freedom Square, accompanied by, among others, Abdul Hafiz Ghoga, deputy chairman of the opposition Transitional National Council. He paused at a courthouse wall covered with scores of pictures of people allegedly killed by Gadhafi's forces and others who have gone missing since uprisings began. ""The American people support you very strongly, and we know it's necessary to help as much as we can,"" McCain told a woman who thanked him for U.S. support. As McCain met with the rebels, miles away in western Libya, a fierce battle continued to rage for control of Misrata, the country's third-largest city. Misrata has been under siege for seven weeks by Gadhafi loyalists. ""Let's face it. This is not a fair fight,"" McCain asserted. ""Maybe we should be doing everything we can to help these people and maybe we're not, and they're dying."" While McCain insisted he would not have gone to Libya without the backing of the White House, a top Middle East analyst told CNN the senator's trip would increase the pressure on President Barack Obama to step up U.S. involvement. McCain ""brings more limelight to the rebels,"" said Michael Rubin, a Middle East scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. ""His visit forces some American officials to reconsider their assessment of the rebels."" ""The fact that McCain was able to conduct this meeting shows a modicum of organization (among the rebels) and also raises the question: if McCain can meet the people for whom we are fighting, why not Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Why not Vice President Joe Biden?"" If McCain returns to Capitol Hill and demands formal recognition of the rebel government as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people, it is certain to shift the debate on U.S. diplomatic posture, Rubin said. If all opponents of the intervention ""have done is sit back comfortably in Washington, it will be harder for them to drum up moral authority to back their arguments,"" he noted. Asked by CNN to define the U.S. end game in Libya, McCain said he envisions ""a departure of Moammar Gadhafi and the Libyan people being able to set up a government by themselves, with the assistance primarily of the Europeans but also the United States of America."" ""Libya is much closer to Europe, and Europeans have greater ties to Libya and greater interests,"" McCain noted. The United Nations has sanctioned military action only to protect civilians. Both American and European leaders, however, have repeatedly stated that their political goal is the ouster of Gadhafi. What would the Gadhafi's departure mean? ""It means one of three things,"" McCain said. ""He joins Hugo Chavez in Venezuela or he goes to International Criminal Court, which is my preference, or he joins Hitler and Stalin."" The senator noted that rebel leaders have insisted Gadhafi step down from power, significantly reducing the chances for a political settlement. When Gadhafi's forces were outside Benghazi, the dictator said he ""was going to go house to house and kill every person that he could,"" McCain added. ""There is no doubt what Col. Gadhafi will do to his own people if he has the opportunity. ... That's not a settlement. That's a massacre."" McCain defended the track record of predator drones in Pakistan and Afghanistan, arguing that their use has only resulted in civilian deaths when targets have been misidentified. Contacted by CNN, McCain's office declined to state how the senator's surprise trip was funded. CNN's Moni Basu, Reza Sayah, and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Teena Marie, a celebrated R&B singer-songwriter, was found dead Sunday at her California home, her manager said. Born Mary Christine Brockert in Santa Monica, California, the 54-year-old artist famously paired with late funk legend Rick James and was nominated four times for a Grammy Award, according to her official website. Marie was found dead by her daughter after apparently dying in her sleep, manager Mike Gardner said. ""Teena was a black voice trapped in a white body,"" said Cathy Hughes, founder of Radio One, a broadcasting company that targets African-American and urban listeners. ""I would always tell her that she was one of the greatest vocalists of our time."" Among her songs were ""Lovergirl,""  ""Portuguese Love,"" ""Ooo La La La,"" and ""I'm a Sucker for Your Love."" While no cause of death has been released, the singer's publicist Lynn Jeter said that Marie suffered a grand mal seizure -- a neurological event, marked by loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions, according to the Mayo Clinic -- a month ago. ""Luckily, someone was there,"" Jeter said of that seizure. ""The ambulance took her to the hospital, and on the way she had another seizure."" The publicist said that she had a ""great"" conversation on Saturday with Marie, who told her that she was excited about heading to Atlanta to perform this week -- in what would have been her first performance since the seizure. Marie sang under various record labels, including Motown, Epic, Stax Records and Cash Money Classics, since bursting on the scene as a 19-year-old, according to her website. Her last studio album, Congo Square, featured several collaborations. ""I am horrified by the sudden death of my darling Teena Marie,"" Motown founder Berry Gordy said in a statement sent by his publicist.  ""She was my 'baby,' always true to herself, always true to her heart."" Berry called her  a ""powerhouse performer, writer, producer and arranger."" ""When I first auditioned her she was so awesome she blew me away,"" Gordy said.  ""She had so much soul -- the only thing white about her was her skin."" ""The enduring influence of Teena's inspirational, trailblazing career, could only have been made possible through her brilliant song-writing, showmanship and high energy passion which laid the ground work for the future generations of R&B, hip-hop, and soul,"" said Gene Rumsey, chief label officer with Concord Music Group.  ""We feel extremely fortunate to have worked with a visionary who changed music in indelible ways."" Eddie Levert, founder of the vocal group The O'Jays, praised Marie as both a singer and mother. ""There are a lot of black people who swore by her and believed in her, as far as her music was concerned,"" he said. ""She was a good mom, and to me, that is saying a lot.'' CNN's Roland S. Martin and Denise Quan contributed to this report.","""She was one of the greatest vocalists of our time,"" says the founder of Radio One .

"(CNN) -- What is seen by some as the holy four-day weekend for geek culture at San Diego Comic-Con has gone mainstream in a big way for the past few years. Are you a Comic-Con beginner? Get the rules right! Starting today, there will be panels called ""I Can't Write, I Can't Draw, But I Love Comics!"" and ""Indie Comics Marketing 101"" taking place alongside ""USA Network's 'Psych' "" and ""Aloha, Earth!"" a panel about CBS' upcoming remake of ""Hawaii Five-0."" But this recent spate of panels about movie and TV properties with no sci-fi or comic book elements has some fans fuming. ""The mainstream TV and film representation at Comic-Con has outstripped the original essence of the convention,"" said iReporter Brad Powers who attended Comic-Con the past two years, mainly for the panels on ""Lost."" He believed that this ""mainstreaming"" of the convention has played a hand in it being filled to capacity. Going to San Diego Comic-Con? For one panel, Powers said he arrived a full 45 minutes before it was set to begin. ""Thirty minutes passed and I thought for sure I was getting closer to the front door. Finally, 10 minutes after the start, some nice Con attendee started walking back through the line to let everyone know that they were full up and no one else would be getting in."" Powers is not attending the convention this year since ""Lost"" has ended. One iReporter, Michelle Cruz, has not attended in years. ""I don't even try anymore,"" she said."" ""They should have a Commercialism-Con and bring back Comic-Con the way it used to be."" ""It's too crowded, too commercial, and, oh yea, it sells out before you even know who's gonna be there,"" she said. ""I'd be really disappointed spending my money and seeing that I was gonna go to a panel discussion about [the Fox series] 'Glee.' "" The fact that ""Glee"" attended last year (and is returning this year) certainly seemed to fuel anger among some Comic-Con devotees. ""It used to be the coolest thing in the world and now it's just a reason not to drive downtown for a few days."" Erin O'Donoghue, a hardcore fan of ""Chuck,"" is one of those who disagrees. ""I am not one of those who believe it should remain solely in the realm of comics and their related forms of media,"" she said. ""I personally really enjoy the fact that SDCC has become a celebration of popular culture and every entertainment medium."" Even those who have covered the convention have differing opinions about it. Vic Holtreman of Screenrant.com doesn't think that non-genre panels are a very good idea. ""I guess the studios figure, well, as long as we're here we might as well throw this movie out there. ... Maybe we give this a little boost,"" he said. ""Last year, at one of the studio panels, they had the Mike Judge film, 'Extract,' and people saw the footage. Then the movie completely tanked."" Fanbolt.com's Emma Loggins, on the other hand, sees a place for these kinds of panels at Comic-Con. ""I think that what it's really about is anything that has a strong fan base. It also brings in other people to the convention that otherwise wouldn't be interested,"" she said. Quite a few people she has talked to, however, disagree with her. She even recalls a quite vocal reaction last year to a movie that, on the surface, would seem like a good fit. ""Con-goers were protesting at the Summit Entertainment booth saying ... with signs, 'Twilight Ruined Comic Con,' because fans couldn't get into see panels earlier in the day because of the thousands of 'Twilight' fans that descended on Hall H."" This year, those fans can breathe a sigh of relief, since the cast of ""The Twilight Saga"" won't be there -- this year. But there are plenty of other panels, such as one for Will Ferrell's cop comedy ""The Other Guys,"" which will ensure the debate continues.","Longtime fans of Comic-Con aren't impressed by non-genre panels .

"I've seen death in war zones -- Afghanistan, Pakistan's tribal region, Libya -- but never have I seen as much bloodshed as I saw in Cairo on August 14, 2013. It was the day Egypt's security forces used automatic weapons, armored personal carriers and military bulldozers to raid and crush a monthlong sit-in protest by thousands of supporters of former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy. According to a yearlong Human Rights Watch investigation released this week, at least 817 people were killed. The rights group called it ""one of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history."" Six weeks earlier, Morsy had been removed from power in a popular military coup led by his then-defense secretary, Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Morsy's supporters immediately took to the streets, protesting the removal of Egypt's first democratically elected president. The heart of the demonstrations was Rabaa Al-Adawiya, a mosque in eastern Cairo where tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered, occupying the building and an adjacent square. For weeks, Egyptian authorities ordered demonstrators to leave, then threatened to raid the massive sit-in that had mushroomed into a small town; it included a makeshift barbershop and a kitchen that prepared thousands of ready-to-eat meals. But Morsy supporters wouldn't budge. Many had brought their families, even their children. This was their Tahrir Square. Then came the raid. Shortly after 7 a.m. I was awakened by a text message from one of the protesters I had interviewed earlier. ""They're coming,"" read the message. About one hour later I was at Rabaa with my team -- CNN producer Salma Abdelaziz and cameraman Ahmed Zeidan. The sit-in protest that spanned several city blocks had turned into a war zone. It looked like the end of the world. There was the incessant crack of gunfire, the anguished cries of protesters, debris-filled intersections on fire, thick smoke mixed with burning tear gas, and bodies -- lots of bodies. I lost count of how many times protesters raced past me carrying bodies wrapped in blankets. Many of them had been shot and killed. ""I saw one teenager with a wound to the head,"" my producer Salma told me. ""I'm still not sure if he was alive."" According to witnesses, security forces moved in shortly before 7 a.m. Authorities claim they used loudspeakers to warn protesters to clear out and provided two safe exits, but witnesses say police immediately opened fire and bulldozed through the camp's tents and makeshift shelters. The front line was a major intersection where protesters erected and set on fire a heaping pile of debris to stop the advance of security forces. ""This was one of the starkest scenes I have ever seen in my life,"" said Salma. ""It's forever etched in my brain -- the scorched ruins of the Rabba square-turned no-man's land --between menacing black police APCs and men behind metal sheets whose greatest form of protection was the loud noise of batons beating against their makeshift barriers. It was utter chaos and bloodletting."" Egyptian authorities had justified the raid by claiming protesters had fired first with automatic weapons, killing one of eight police officer who died that day. During my 12 hours at Rabaa I never saw protesters carrying automatic weapons. At one point I saw one protester firing what looked like a homemade pistol. But the vast majority of protesters were fighting heavily armed security with clubs, rocks, and sometimes Molotov cocktails. Witnesses and rights groups dispute the government's claims too. In its investigation, Human Rights Watch concluded that ""demonstrators fired on police in at least a few instances."" ""The killing of 817 or more protesters was clearly disproportionate to any threat to local residents, security personnel, or anyone else,"" the report said. Later in the day the Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said security forces had recovered 15 guns, a small number relative to the thousands of protesters at the encampment. The most lasting images of the day came from the camp's makeshift hospital. Scores of wounded bodies were strewn on blood-smeared floors. Most of victims appeared to be shot. ""The smell is what I remember the most,"" said Zeidan, my cameraman. ""I was doing my job but I was scared. I tried to keep my eye on my viewfinder and imagine that this was just a TV show. The only thing that broke through was the smell of blood. It was a massacre."" Several hours into the raid the crew from Sky News walked by and warned us that snipers on rooftops were targeting anyone wearing protective helmets. Their cameraman was the gentle giant Mick Deane, a veteran photojournalist who had worked for CNN and ITV News before joining Sky News. Later in the day I learned that Deane had been shot and killed. ""I think the security forces just got tired of seeing him there. So they decided to kill him,"" Mick's wife Daniela wrote in an opinion piece this week in the Washington Post. ""Not that I'll ever know for sure. They've never admitted it, of course, and the coroner's investigation of Mick's death the morning of Aug. 14, 2013, in Cairo has yielded nothing. A year later, I've given up thinking it ever will."" Deane was months away from retiring, his wife said. By 6 p.m., security forces had taken full control of the area, demolishing hundreds of tents and bulldozing anything in sight -- including charred remains of protesters. Thousands of protesters left in utter shock and despair. One car rolled past me with a body in the trunk. In the backseat of another car a woman cradled the body of her dead husband. On a nearby sidewalk a teenager sobbed as he knelt before his dead brother. ""I stopped a young girl in the exodus,"" said Salma. ""We had done a story just the day before with her on Eid and she was dancing and singing with friends about the holiday and her love for Morsy and the (Muslim) Brotherhood. Now she was crying uncontrollably -- 'See what they have done to us? Did you see?' she cried.'"" In its investigation Human Rights Watch said the killings in Rabaa were ""likely crimes against humanity"" and called on the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate more than a dozen senior Egyptian leaders, including current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. ""This wasn't merely a case of excessive force or poor training,"" said Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth in a statement that appeared on the group's website. ""It was a violent crackdown planned at the highest levels of the Egyptian government. Many of the same officials are still in power in Egypt, and have a lot to answer for."" The Egyptian government rejected the report by Human Rights Watch as biased. In a statement this week, the government said it had appointed what it calls an ""independent fact-finding commission"" to investigate the raid on Rabaa. The same statement said similar fact-finding commissions in Egypt had concluded, ""the dispersal of the sit-ins was conducted in accordance with the relevant international standards.""","Thursday is the anniversary of the violent crackdown on pro-Morsy protesters in Cairo .

"Pretty much everything has changed in U.S.-China relations since Richard Nixon and Premier Zhou Enlai signed the Shanghai Communiqué 40 years ago on February 21, 1972. Nixon's goals were purely geostrategic.  By cultivating China, he sought most of all to put pressure on North Vietnam to come to terms to achieve his promised ""peace with honor"" there, hopefully before the November election.  He also sought, through China, to pressure Moscow to embrace détente and thus put America in the catbird seat in relations with the two communist behemoths. China had different priorities -- most of all, Beijing wanted to stiffen President Nixon's spine to oppose Soviet aggression and therefore to reduce Moscow's threat to China. In the 1980s, Beijing got its way with Ronald Reagan, who came into office as an anti-Soviet crusader.  Indeed, President Reagan aligned U.S. strategic interests with China so closely that America began military sales to Beijing.  But in 1989 everything changed.  President George H.W. Bush, just inaugurated and planning to move U.S.-China relations to a new level, saw this goal cut short by the brutal suppression of demonstrators at Tiananmen on June 4, 1989.  As China transitioned from being America's darling reforming communist country to being its poster child for communist repression, the Soviet Bloc (and soon afterward, the Soviet Union itself) unraveled. Not only did the Soviet collapse rob U.S.-China relations of their underlying strategic rationale, post-Tiananmen repression in China introduced human rights as a major political factor in the relationship.  Every American human rights organization expended much effort in the 1990s to attach China somehow to that agenda and thus increase its own visibility and emotional power. This made it far more difficult to deal with Beijing, especially as the Chinese connected this human rights agenda directly to an American objective to bring down the Communist Party's rule.  The result was deep mutual distrust. Deng Xiaoping in 1992 set the country again on a course of reform to generate rapid growth, which he viewed as critical to maintain the party's rule.  Economics now moved to the center of U.S.-China relations. Where in the 1970s the Nixon administration could ignore China's horrendous human rights abuses under Mao to achieve American geopolitical ends, starting in the 1990s, America pursued economic gains in China in part with the hope that these would also lay the foundation for democratic evolution there.  This took place in the context of overwhelming American economic and technological superiority, further enhanced by the information revolution that America also led. This history highlights a core reality: the U.S.-China relationship has never sustained one rationale or focus for very long.  It has periodically adapted to major developments in the international environment and in domestic politics.  None of those changes has come easily.  Each sowed apprehension, distrust and deep doubts about the future. We are now at another such turning point.  Both sides look to the future knowing that we are deeply interdependent but also deeply conflicted economically and have no common strategic enemy to bind us. The people of each country interact on a scale never before achieved, but caricatures often replace realistic images in shaping popular opinions in both countries. Perhaps most challenging, both countries know they cannot continue to pursue the economic policies that have worked to date, yet neither is confident that it can make the changes necessary to thrive in the future. In sum, U.S.-China relations now encompass real interdependence but also deep mutual distrust, with unusually large uncertainties about each country's future prospects -- including the future power balance.  Allowing strategic drift at this point will likely lead to our moving further apart, while our degree of success in getting our respective economic houses in order will deeply affect future economic and trade relations. In the absence of a major threat to bind China and the United States, we face the danger of making each other the threat we must guard against. That may prove unavoidable, but it will also achieve, at best, limited and very costly long-term security. This is not the year to look for serious progress.  China will witness a 70% turnover in its top party, government and military bodies in the coming 13 months, and nobody wants to take major new initiatives now. In America,  China policy has become a part of the election  debate over  how to make America bounce back.  With Mitt Romney adopting  very tough trade and military positions to force China to change its policies, President Obama has committed America to maintain its leadership role in Asia and demanded that China ""play by the rules of the game.""  He is establishing a body to rigorously enforce America's trade rules against ""countries like China.""   The net result of the coming 12 months is likely to be deeper distrust in U.S.-China relations. To have the U.S.-China relationship again adapt for the future, therefore, both sides should begin to lay the groundwork to begin serious, long-term engagement as of 2013 around a core topic: What are each country's core requirements to assure its own overall security in Asia, and how can each side meet those requirements without posing an unacceptable threat to the other? The economic changes each needs to make are remarkably in the interests of the other, too.  To adapt U.S.-China relations for the future in the economic and trade side, we should initiate what will be prolonged and difficult negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty and for a U.S.-China free trade agreement. The negotiating process on both security and economic issues can itself help move policies and sentiments in the right directions. U.S.-China relations have never been smooth, but they have served both countries' interests very well over the past 40 years. Now they must adapt again, and it is still worth the effort to make this happen. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Chicago police on Wednesday found a handgun near where the body of one of actress Jennifer Hudson's three slain relatives was discovered this week. An investigator picks up a gun discovered not far from where Jennifer Hudson's nephew was found slain. Police said they recovered a weapon in an alley within a block of where Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found dead in an SUV on Monday morning. Aerial footage of the scene taken by Chicago TV station WLS showed an investigator putting a pistol in a box. A police spokesman said testing was needed to confirm whether the weapon was connected to the Hudson case. Julian's body was found in an abandoned Chevrolet Suburban on Chicago's West Side. Police had begun a massive search for him on Friday, the day Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, and brother, Jason Hudson, were found slain in their South Side Chicago home. All three victims died from multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said. The pistol was found by one of 50 police academy recruits who were searching parts of the city for possible evidence in the case, Deputy Chief Nick Roti said. The recruit spotted the weapon in the thick shrubbery of a vacant alley around the corner from where the sport-utility vehicle was found, Roti said. The site where the SUV was found has turned into a makeshift memorial for Julian, Roti said. Stuffed animals and balloons were there Wednesday night. Julian was the son of Jennifer Hudson's sister, Julia Hudson, who police said found one of the bodies Friday and called police. William Balfour, 27, who is Julian's stepfather and Julia Hudson's estranged husband, was detained Friday for questioning in connection with the slayings, a police representative said. Julian was not with Balfour when he was detained. Balfour was later transferred to state custody for a parole violation. He spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, carjacking and possession of a stolen vehicle and was released in May. Police have so far refused to discuss precisely how he violated parole. Authorities said only that Balfour's parole violation was of a ""technical"" nature, which could range from a curfew violation to missing an appointment with a parole officer. WLS reported that Balfour missed an appointment with his parole agent Friday. The agent phoned Balfour, who told the agent he was baby-sitting, the station said. Balfour violated his parole by possessing a weapon and by failing to attend an anger management class and a substance abuse program, according to WLS. Balfour also was arrested in June on suspicion of drug possession, officials said, but there was not enough evidence to constitute a parole violation. WLS reported that cocaine was found in Balfour's car. On Tuesday night, Balfour's mother, Michele Davis-Balfour, told CNN's Nancy Grace her son had nothing to do with the slayings. ""My son's alibi was [he was] with one of his girlfriends, OK?"" Davis-Balfour said. When Grace asked which girlfriend he was with Friday, the mother said her son was with a woman named Diana on Friday night, and with a woman named Kate on Saturday morning. A Tuesday autopsy report revealed Julian had been shot multiple times, but the Cook County Medical Examiner's report did not say when the child died and where his wounds were. On Monday, Davis-Balfour spoke about the nature of her son's relationship with Julia Hudson. On Julia Hudson's MySpace page Monday afternoon, she wrote: ""Now because I chose to do what was natural to me and love someone, it cost me my beautiful family, my wonderful beautiful loving supporting mother, Darnell, my true blue baby brother, Jason, I love u big baby ... and last but never not least, my only son, Julian."" Davis-Balfour disputed that her son and Julia Hudson had a rocky relationship. Grace asked if the two were ""romantically"" involved, and Balfour answered that they were. Julia Hudson and her son were together Thursday night after she invited Balfour to celebrate her birthday by having cake. ""People don't understand what's going on. My son loved her. She loved him,"" Davis-Balfour said. ""... Regardless to whatever anyone says, my son still loved Julia."" Davis-Balfour expressed anger that her son's picture has been splashed on media reports since Friday, though reports have been careful to point out that police have not named him as a suspect in the killings. ""You all have put my son's face on worldwide news like he's -- like he's Attila the Hun,"" Davis-Balfour said. ""You all are not saying that my son obtained his GED while he was in the correctional facility. You all are not saying that my son took up horticulture while he was there. William is a very smart and intelligent young man.""  Watch Davis-Balfour talk about her son » . The mother also discussed her son's criminal past, elaborating on his carjacking and attempted murder charges. ""No, he has never done bodily harm to no one. He has never been the type of kid that you could say was a violent type,"" she said. ""My son -- it was still in the man's car, right? The man saw my son starting his car. He ran outside, jumped on top of his own vehicle. ""This is why they said vehicle hijacking, because my son jumped -- the man jumped on top of the car while my son was stealing it, right? He stuck his hand inside the driver's side and started choking my son. So my son kept driving even more, took the owner of the vehicle on a high-speed ..."" Davis-Balfour said. Authorities said they are confident they will soon catch the killer. ""I suspect that we'll have some evidence that will link us to the killer,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis said Tuesday. Police are collecting evidence from the SUV and reviewing surveillance tapes from all over the city as the investigation continues, Weis told reporters. ""There's a lot of work to be done. We'll be sure we go through this thoroughly,"" Weis said. Asked about possible motives, Weis replied, ""We don't know what the motive really was at this time. But, clearly, you have people who do know each other, so it wasn't a case of a stranger-type homicide.""

"(CNN) -- Burglars broke into Amy Winehouse's London home early Thursday and took away several valuable guitars, recording equipment and a flat-screen TV, according to her spokesman. Winehouse is currently vacationing in the Caribbean. It was an easy mark for intruders who may have known Winehouse has been away for weeks on a Caribbean vacation, spokesman Chris Goodman said. ""It's one of life's little ironies,"" he said. ""Usually, hundreds of paparazzi are outside her home."" When the Grammy-winning singer is in town, ""it's the safest street in London,"" he said. Winehouse, who is on the island of St. Lucia, is ""writing music with another guitar that didn't get burgled,"" Goodman said. ""She's doing very well and is enjoying her time away,"" he said, but she is thinking about returning to London soon. London police have already recovered some of the electronics taken from Winehouse's home, according to a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman. A neighbor called police to the home after two men kicked in the front door at 4 a.m. Thursday, the spokeswoman said. No arrests have been made, she said. The burglary wasn't the only bad news for Winehouse during her vacation. Husband Blake Fielder-Civil earlier this month asked his lawyer ""to commence divorce proceedings on the grounds of Amy's adultery,"" said his lawyer, Henri Brandman. That came after Fielder-Civil saw photos of her cavorting with another man in the Caribbean while he sat in a British jail.","Flat-screen TV, guitars in haul as burglars target Winehouse's London home .

"Secretary of State John Kerry stressed Thursday that the United States is interested only in communicating with Iran, not working with the country, to push back Islamist militants who are threatening Iraq. On Thursday, he told NBC News that statements he'd made this week seem to have been misunderstood. ""What I said is we are interested in communicating with Iran to make clear that the Iranians know what we're thinking and we know what they're thinking and there's a sharing of information so people aren't making mistakes,"" the secretary said. The idea of the U.S. working with Iran would be a ""head-scratcher,"" he said. ""No. We're not sitting around contemplating if we're going to do that. That's not on the table."" In a Yahoo News interview this week, Kerry was asked: ""Can you see cooperating with Iran militarily? According to a transcript of that interview on the State Department's website, the secretary responded: ""I -- at this moment, I think we need to go step by step and see what, in fact, might be a reality, but I wouldn't rule out anything that would be constructive to providing real stability, a respect for the constitution, a respect for the election process, and a respect for the ability of the Iraqi people to form a government that represents all of the interests of Iraq, not one sectarian group over another. It has to be inclusive, and that has been one of the great problems of the last few years."" Kerry was then asked: ""If Iran recognizes that, would you be willing to work with that country?"" He answered, ""Let's see what Iran might or might not be willing to do before we start making any pronouncements. I think we are open to any constructive process here that could minimize the violence, hold Iraq together, the integrity of the country, and eliminate the presence of outside terrorist forces that are ripping it apart."" After that interview, there was debate on television news and in print stories about the possibility of the U.S. and Iran working together to help Iraq. CNN asked experts if it was even possible for the longtime foes to join forces. In Thursday's NBC interview, Kerry said that ""nothing is off the table. All options are available"" to President Barack Obama when it comes to batting ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Made up of mostly Sunni Muslims, ISIS is an al Qaeda splinter group that wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. The group has had significant success in Syria battling President Bashar al-Assad's security forces. Since launching its battle for Iraqi territory, ISIS has said it has killed at least 1,700 Shiites. Scores of Iraqis have fled their homes, prompting fears of a brewing humanitarian crisis. NBC said to Kerry: ""It seems like the U.S. was totally caught off guard by this."" ""Look, our people on the ground in Iraq have seen the increased intensity,"" he replied. ""We've been watching this happening. We have been engaged in efforts over the months. We've been beefing up our assistance, our presence."" On Wednesday, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that the U.S. has received a request from the Iraqi government to use its air power in the conflict. Dempsey, the senior ranking member of the U.S. armed forces, spoke before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday on Capitol Hill in Washington, saying that the United States' ""national security interest (is) to counter (ISIS) where we find them."" Kerry stressed in the NBC interview that ISIS is ""threatening"" to U.S. and Western interests. He said that the U.S. has not acted so far ""for a lot of different reasons,"" including that, until recently, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ""denied the kind of permissions necessary."" Kerry then stressed that any assistance to Iraq is ""not about Maliki."" ""Let me stress: What the United States is doing is about Iraq,"" Kerry said. ""It is not about Maliki. Nothing that the President decides to do is going to be focused specifically on Prime Minister Maliki. It is focused on the people of Iraq."" Kerry said the U.S. is ""deeply engaged in working with our allies and friends in the region. We are assisting, training, doing work in terms of providing nonlethal aid and assistance."" NBC asked Kerry what he would say to Iraq veterans and their families who lost so much during that long war, only to contemplate that the country is on the brink again. Whether Iraq gets to that terrible point ""remains to be seen,"" Kerry responded. ""The test is in, really, these next few days and weeks. We are going to do everything in our power to follow through and try to get the job done through diplomacy ... to honor their sacrifice."" Obama to Congress: I don't need new permission on Iraq .

"A 34-year-old father was being held by authorities Wednesday in connection with the deaths of his three daughters, who were found inside his ex-wife's Wisconsin home with the gas fireplace turned on, officials said. Aaron Schaffhausen of Minot, North Dakota, is expected to be arraigned Thursday, said officials in River Falls, Wisconsin. Formal charges are pending, and Schaffhausen is being held in the St. Croix County Jail, officials said.

"April 23 is, according to some reports, William Shakespeare's birthday. In a nod to the Bard's enduring legacy 450 years on from his birth, as well as the UK's theatrical history, here are a few stages worth seeing, whether a play's being performed or not. Shakespeare's Globe theater (London) The original Globe theater was built by Shakespeare's company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, in 1599, but was destroyed by fire in 1613. A replica was built in 1997 just meters from the original site, with historical records used for guidance. Though almost identical in appearance to the original, the new 857-seat structure has several modern features, including roof-based sprinklers and a concrete theater pit, as opposed to the straw-strewn one that would have existed in 1599. One feature faithfully recreated is the roof -- Shakespeare's Globe has the first and only thatched roof permitted in London since the great fire of 1666. Shakespeare's Globe, 21 New Globe Walk, Bankside, London; +44 20 7902 1400 . The Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (Düsseldorf, Germany) The history of this German theater dates to 1818, when King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia presented it to the residents of Düsseldorf as a gift. The modern theater that now stands on the original site was built in the late 1960s. Its curved, undulating lines are designed to resemble a theater curtain. Architect Bernhard Pfau's design was chosen in a competition. The Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus, Gustaf-Gründgens-Platz 1, Düsseldorf, Germany; +49 211 85230 . Balboa Theatre (San Diego) The Balboa Theatre was built in 1924 and named after Spanish explorer Vasco Nuñez de Balboa -- the first European to discover the Pacific Ocean. The property fell into disrepair, but in 2002 a major restoration began. A replica of the theater's sign, depicting Vasco's ship, was created using original colors identified from photographs, and stencils were used to painstakingly recreate the tapestry design that once adorned the walls. ""After a $26 million renovation, this elegant vaudeville theater has been fully restored, complete with its one-of-a-kind, fully operational interior waterfalls,"" says Ken Stein at the League of Historic American Theaters. ""If you could sum up the beauty of the City of San Diego in a single design, this would be it."" Balboa Theatre, 868 4th Ave., San Diego; +1 619 570 110 . BAM Harvey theater (New York) The BAM Harvey opened in 1904 as a venue for Shakespearean plays, vaudeville revues and musicals. It was converted into a cinema in 1942, before dancer Harvey Lichtenstein commissioned architect Hugh Hardy to refurbish the interior so it could operate as a theater again. Today's structure incorporates the original columns and water-stained ceilings, giving the venue a Greco-Roman feel. ""The 1987 restoration preserved the ornate detail and retained its historical associations, while rebuilding the stage and stripping it out to the bare brick back wall,"" says Professor Arnold Aronson at Columbia University's theater arts program. ""It was one of the most exciting theater renovations of the past three decades."" BAM Harvey theater, 651 Fulton St., Brooklyn, New York; +1 718 636 4100 . National Noh Theatre (Tokyo) Forget cement and plasterboard -- Japan's Noh theater was constructed in 1983 from 400-year-old bishu-hinoki cypress trees. It's open on three sides and the seating spreads out from the stage in a fan shape. Despite the traditional elements there's plenty of tech -- each seat has a personal subtitling system that can be changed from Japanese to English at the touch of a button. Noh (meaning ""skill"" or ""talent"") is a form of traditional Japanese musical drama, and plays often last all day. National Noh Theatre, 4-18-1, Sendagaya, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo; +81 3 3423 1331 . Salle Richelieu (Paris) The Salle Richelieu, also known as the Comédie Française, was built in the late 1600s. The grand staircase is lined with busts of important figures from the theater's past -- the bust of French playwright Corneille is rather worn, due to the belief that touching it will bring good luck. ""It's the archetypal theater -- a womb-like curve of red plush and gold,"" says professor Jan Clarke at the International Federation for Theater Research. ""It's also a living museum, containing objects, artifacts, paintings and sculptures of huge interest for the history of French theater, including the armchair actor Jean-Baptiste Poquelin used in 'Le Malade Imaginaire' just hours before his death."" The Salle Richelieu, 8 Rue de Montpensier, Paris; +33 1 44 58 15 15 . Minack Theatre (Cornwall, UK) The setting is so stunning at this cliff-edge theater that you might find yourself getting distracted. On the plus side, the roaring waves could be a blessing for those who've forgotten to turn their phones off. The theater was the brainchild of the late Rowena Cade, who decided to allow her garden to be used by a local theatrical group. In 1932, Cade, with the help of her gardener, hauled several tons of rock from the beach below and created a more permanent venue, which she opened to the public. Today, there are performances between June and September, though the theater remains open all year round. Minack Theatre, Porthcurno, Penzance, Cornwall, UK; +44 1736 810694 . State Theatre (Sydney) Sydney's State Theatre opened in 1928. It was designed by Aussie architect Eli White, but his decision to base his masterpiece on the work of American John Eberson resulted in a mishmash of Gothic, Italian and art deco styles. The theater contains the second largest chandelier in the world and a priceless Wurlitzer organ, and is recognized by The National Trust of Australia, which has classified it as ""a building of great historical significance and high architectural quality, the preservation of which is regarded as essential to our heritage."" State Theatre, 49 Market St., Sydney, Australia; +61 2 9373 6655 . Margravial Opera House (Bayreuth, Germany) Built in 1745, the UNESCO-listed Margravial Opera House is regarded as the finest baroque theater in Europe. The stage has a depth of 27 meters and was the largest in Europe until 1871. Much of the original materials remain (including vast expanses of painted canvas and wood), along with original structures, such as the twin staircases that led up to the private box belonging to Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreut and his wife, who commissioned the theater. These staircases were designed so the audience below could observe the couple's ascension to their seats. Margravial Opera House, Opernstrasse 14, Bayreuth, Germany; +49 9 21 7 59 69 22 . Teatro Amazonas (Manaus, Brazil) There can't be many theaters located in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, and the Teatro Amazonas is certainly the most spectacular. The theater was built in the late 19th century during a rubber boom and was designed by Italian architect Celestial Sacardim. Work took 15 years, largely thanks to the decision to source supplies from all over the world: the roof tiles came from Alsace in France, stairs and columns were made of Italian marble and the steel walls came from Glasgow. Beautiful features include 198 chandeliers, which also came from Italy, and the central dome, covered in 36,000 ceramic tiles painted in the colors of Brazil's national flag. Amazon Theater, Centro, Manaus, Brazil; +55 92 3622 1880 . Palais Garnier (Paris) The Palais Garnier was the most expensive building built in Paris during the second French empire (1852-1870) and was the setting for Gaston Leroux's novel ""The Phantom of the Opera."" The interior is filled with marble friezes, bronze busts and ornate light fittings -- the most famous of which is a six-ton chandelier. In 1896, one of the chandelier's counterweights crashed through the ceiling, killing an audience member -- an incident that inspired a scene in Leroux's famous play. The Palais Garnier, Paris, France, 8 Rue Scribe, Paris; +33 1 71 25 24 23 . Tampa Theatre (Florida) Tampa Theatre is the work of architect John Eberson, who also designed the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas. Highlights include a 900-pipe Wurlitzer organ and 99 bulbs embedded in the ceiling to resemble twinkling stars. It was regarded as one of the world's most elaborate theaters when it was built in 1926 and the interior -- a somewhat garish explosion of flowers and angry gargoyles -- resembles a Mediterranean courtyard. ""The simplistic beauty of the Paramount Theatre confirms that Eberson was a genius at designing vaudeville houses,"" remarks Ken Stein at the League of Historic American Theaters. ""But when you see the Tampa with its complexity and elaborate atmospheric design, you realize Eberson was also a mad genius."" Tampa Theatre, 711 N Franklin St., Tampa, Florida; +1 813 274 8981 . Teatru Manoel (Valetta, Malta) Teatru Manoel is one of Europe's oldest working theaters -- it was built in 1731 with funds from The Knights of Malta, a Western Christian military order. It remained unscathed during both World Wars, despite serving as a bomb shelter during the second, and many original features remain, including beautiful painted wooden panels and the silver leaf-adorned ceiling. Teatru Manoel, Valletta, Malta; +356 2124 6389 . Mabel Tainter Center for the Arts (Wisconsin) If this tiny theater is anything to go by, bigger certainly doesn't mean better. Within this building visitors find stained glass windows, fireplaces, lots of brass, walnut and oak and a water-powered pipe organ. ""It was built in 1889 by Harvey Ellis as a memorial to the daughter of Captain and Mrs. Andrew Tainter,"" says Ken Stein at the League of Historic American Theaters.

The Elgin and Winter Garden Theater Center (Toronto) This is actually two theaters, stacked on top of each other, to create the world's only operating double-decker theater. The Winter Gardens Theater is seven stories above the Elgin Theater in downtown Toronto. The Elgin has dancing cherubs, elaborately decorated boxes, vast expanses of gold leaf and plaster sculpting covered in wafer-thin sheets of aluminum, while the Winter Gardens has hand-painted walls and a ceiling decorated with dried beech leaves.

"More than 90% of the Internet was shut down in Syria Thursday as rebel clashes with Bashar al-Assad's forces were reported near the Damascus airport. It's not the first time the Web has been blocked in the war-torn country, but the move toward the airport could be highly significant, said retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt, who worked as assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs under President George Bush. Damascus, the capital, is the seat of al-Assad's power. It is also home to many Syrians who belong to the Alawite sect. The al-Assads are Alawite. Rebels fighting al-Assad's forces and possibly winning at or near the airport ""would have a psychological affect,"" Kimmitt explained. ""The civilians in Damascus will feel cut off from the outside world."" The Alawites, he said, understand there are very few alternatives other than staying in Syria now, but if rebels take the airport, they would likely feel trapped. Some will go on about their lives, a coping mechanism, he said. Some will flee to neighborhood countries, while others may actually choose to take a stronger position in defending al-Assad. Strategically, Kimmitt noted that most of the military's aircraft are being flown out of bases elsewhere in the country. The road to Damascus International Airport was shut down because the rebels and the military were fighting on the outskirts of the city, said the opposition-supporting, London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Egypt Air is canceling flights to Syria starting Friday, said Egypt Air spokesman Mohamed Rahma. The airline cited a ""deteriorating situation"" around the Damascus airport, a Cairo airport official said, according to Egyptian semi-official news agency Al-Ahram. On the other side, government-run TV ran an urgent banner saying that the road to Damascus International Airport had been secured after ""terrorists"" attacked cars. Al-Assad's regime has routinely blamed terrorists for the violence in the country. Internet blocked . Also Wednesday, most Internet access in Syria was shut down, according to the Internet monitoring group Renesys. It was not clear who was behind the latest outage, but the government has intermittently cut off Internet access several times in the past two years. Opposition activists often transmit updates about the civil war in reports and images on the Web. Syria state TV reports that the government's minister of communications said maintenance workshops were working on ""fixing the blackout in the main communication and Internet network in a number of Syrian provinces."" U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said that in response to government Internet-related actions, the United States has given ""a thousand pieces of non-lethal equipment -- largely communications gear"" to help opposition activists get around the cyber roadblocks. He spoke in Washington on Wednesday about the humanitarian situation in the country. He talked to CNN Thursday. ""The Syrian government has been monitoring (the Internet) for years. They have been using the Internet with Iranian assistance to track opposition activists, arrest and kill them,"" Ford said. ""That is the reason why our non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition, we put a special emphasis on communications equipment precisely to help the Syrian people tell the world what is going on inside Syria,"" he said. ""A lot of the pictures that you see on the nightly news are from communication equipment that we supply to very brave and very dedicated opposition activists inside Syria,"" Ford said. ""We have provided over a thousand pieces of non-lethal equipment -- largely communications gear to help them get around the restrictions on the Internet that the Syrian government imposes."" But Kimmitt, asked by CNN to respond to Ford's comments, said he thinks the gear that United States has provided has not been enough. ""I think it's an attempt on the part of the (Obama) administration, albeit it has an insufficient amount of support for the rebels,"" the former general said. ""What side of history are we going to end up? ""To suggest a thousand pieces of equipment has made a difference -- I would turn back to the number of casualties we've seen."" About 40,000 civilians have been killed since the first protests began in March 2011 against al-Assad's government, according to the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. Meanwhile, more than 380,000 Syrians have fled the violence and become refugees in countries such as Turkey and Lebanon, the United Nations reports. The Local Coordination Committees in Syria, the group that speak for the rebels, said Thursday that at least 20 people were killed and more than 80 wounded in an airstrike in a residential area, the Al-Ansari district in Aleppo. Most of the wounded were children, they said. An anti-Assad activist in Aleppo uploaded videos of the attack. One shows children being dug out of rubble and rushed away. In another video on older man appears dazed as he carries the remains of a bomb. He says: ""This is a gift from Bashar to the people of Al-Ansar district. Look at the building over there. Two floors have been destroyed, and this is part of the rocket that destroyed these buildings."" Rebels claim to shoot down military aircraft . On Wednesday, villagers in northern Syria picked pieces of a downed fighter jet from an olive grove after rebel fighters claimed to have shot down three government aircraft in 24 hours. Al-Assad's government has relied increasingly on air power to battle the 21-month-old revolt against it, and witnesses said a cheer went up when the jet went down near Aleppo. ""We want to take this ... to show them in the other villages,"" a man who identified himself as Abu Dargham told CNN as he showed off two twisted chunks of metal. ""Let them see what happened to these planes."" The downed plane's tail was largely intact, but the fuselage was in pieces and the type of aircraft was not immediately identifiable. Locals picked it apart, some of them stuffing pieces into bags as a tractor hauled away what appeared to be an engine. Cheering children were piled on the tractor as it drove away. Witnesses said two fliers ejected from the plane before the crash. One was found unconscious and taken to a makeshift clinic, while villagers said they were still searching for the other late Wednesday. Rebels posted two videos online to support their claims. One shows rebels carrying an unconscious man wearing what looks like a military pilot uniform, while another includes footage of medics bandaging a bloodied and moaning man. ""Here is the pilot who was shelling houses of civilians!"" someone says off-camera. ""The heroes of Darret Ezza shot down his plane!""","Rebels clash with the military near the Damascus airport, according to reports .

"(CNN) -- Brazil and beaches go together like bossa nova and ""The Girl From Ipanema,"" which, of course, put the country on the map as a hub of sun and sand and the eternally tanned and lovely. With 4,650 miles of mostly tropical coastline, Brazil can lay claim to one of the biggest collections of balmy shores on the planet, little of it known outside Brazil. From seafronts piled high with dunes and pocked with turquoise pools in the Northeast states of Maranao and Rio Grande do Norte, to the rugged shores of Bahia, to secluded coves on the southern island of Santa Catarina, Brazil's best beaches make the place a shore lover's nirvana. Brazilians take their coastal assets seriously, and beach culture is a big part of the lifestyle. Beachgoers in Rio de Janeiro have been known to break into applause as the sun sets after a particularly fine day of bronzing. Yes, Rio has its share of world-class city beaches, but Brazil's best beaches, the ones that get you away from it all, are found elsewhere. There are dozens of breathtaking stretches of golden sand up and down the long coast of Brazil. Given that distances are vast and infrastructure not always on the same page you are, let's narrow the list down to Brazil's best beaches that you're most likely to get to without a trekking guide. Ipanema, Zona Sul, Rio de Janeiro . Most travelers will see their first beaches in Rio, which does have some remarkable, if crowded shores. Of the famed Zona Sul beaches, Ipanema is a classic choice. If it's not too crowded, it's a beautiful stretch of sand, with kiosks to pick up a coconut to down the water from the shell or a caipirinha. There's plenty of scenery along the sand and the jagged pinnacles of the Two Brothers that loom up beyond the next beach, Leblon. A couple blocks from the water, you can revisit the inspiration for the ""Girl from Ipanema"" with a visit to Garota de Ipanema, the cafe where the song was written. If your tastes run to fewer tourists, more nature, Arpoador Beach is hidden by the rocky bluffs separating Copacabana from Ipanema. It's an isolated cove with wild waves and (relative) peace in the middle of chaos. Praia dos Carneiros, Pernambuco . About an hour south of Recife, Tamandare is an unpretentious beach town with a shore you can wander for miles and explore nearby wetlands. A couple miles from town, you'll find one of the most idyllic coastal stretches in Brazil. Tucked into a grove of palms off a dirt road, Praia dos Carneiros looks like it escaped from a South Seas postcard. The white sand beach faces a small, lagoon-style bay that's great for swimming. The water is bathtub-warm, and there are no waves to contend with. Leaning, long-frond palms form a picturesque colonnade down the shoreline. Watercraft are available for rent, and boat tours of the bay and wetlands are a great way to get to know the area. Carneiros's superb natural setting is perfect for a quiet, not chaotic, day at the beach. The secret to the tranquility is that Carneiros is a private beach. It and the area around it are owned by a single family, which has managed to keep it from being overrun. It's not cheap -- $30 a day per car, and the only on-site food is also pricey, but the serenity and scenery are worth it. A day at one of Brazil's best beaches doesn't get much more relaxing than this. Caraiva, Bahia . With almost 700 miles of coastline, and smack in the tropical zone, the state of Bahia is loaded with sleepy fishing villages and spectacular beaches. One of the best is Caraiva, a hidden beauty 30 miles south of Bahia's best-known beach site, Porto Seguro. There are no vehicles in Caraiva other than the four-legged kind, so the roar you hear is the crashing of waves or mules. It wasn't that long ago the town didn't even have electricity. The beach here goes on for hours, verdant headlands on one side, azure sea on the other. Though there isn't a lot of commerce around, you can eat tasty seafood, and the trusty mules make sure you're stocked with beverages. There's a ""lost in time"" quality about Caraiva, but with beaches this exquisite, that won't last for long. Taipus de Fora, Bahia . Few colors have the power of translucent turquoise to stop humans in their tracks. Taipus de Fora has enough of the hue to keep the most jaded traveler enchanted. Located on the sea side of the Marau Peninsula on the south coast of Bahia, this beach is a snorkeler's dream. As the tide ebbs, it leaves behind brilliant, turquoise reef pools perfect for viewing an assortment of colorful tropical fish. No need for Photoshop here. That turquoise is the real deal. The beach itself runs broad and golden for some four miles, with thick, luscious palms. You won't have trouble finding a reasonably priced place to stay, with accommodations from hotels to pousadas to rental houses and campgrounds, or a bar to imbibe near a reef pool. It's easy to make the case for Taipus de Fora as one of Brazil's best beaches. Porto da Barra, Salvador, Bahia . In many ways, Porto da Barra is to Salvador (capital of the state of Bahia) what Bondi is to Sydney and Venice Beach is to Los Angeles. Tiny fishing boats bring in the day's catch, there's beach volleyball and plenty to see at the Fisherman Colony Manguinhos, a traditional fish market in Buizos. This is one of the few beaches in the lively city of Salvador that faces west, so you can catch great sunsets. Praia da Pipa, Rio Grande do Norte . A backwater fishing village until backpackers discovered it in the 1970s, Praia da Pipa is a favorite weekend retreat for locals in nearby large cities such as Recife and a respected Northeast Brazil stop for global travelers as well. A number of international visitors came here and never left, staying on to run small pousadas or restaurants. The attractions are obvious -- a beautiful natural setting, with steep pink cliffs rising above the sand and remnants of the great Atlantic Forest that once draped this coast still alive and verdant. There's plenty to do -- surfing, dolphin-watching, sand-boarding. At night, Pipa village is packed with cafes and bars where you can meet and greet and knock back caipirinhas. Praia do Sancho, Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco . Often voted Brazil's best beach, Praia do Sancho is a bay on the island of Fernando de Noronha, facing the coast of Brazil rather than out into the Atlantic Ocean. Covered in vegetation, its steep, rocky cliffs form a backdrop to clear waters that are accessible only via ladders attached to the cliff face or by boat. Porto de Galinhas, Pernambuco . For those whose tastes run to popular beach resorts, Brazil has mass tourism sites beyond Rio, the biggest including Paraty and Buzios. The most respected major tourist beach in Brazil is Porto de Galinas, about 45 minutes south of Recife. Its lower-key, more eco-centric approach attracts fans on both the independent and mass travel side. The beach is a perennial winner of the ""best beach in Brazil"" award by readers of ""Viagem e Turismo"" (""Travel and Tourism""), a popular Brazilian travel magazine. A former fishing village, Porto de Galinhas is famed for its crystalline reef pools, which make for great snorkeling and swimming. Small sailboats (jangadas) take you out to explore the pools, though the most treasured of the pools, which resembles a map of Brazil, is protected and off-limits. Porto de Galinhas is the complete package -- a beautiful 11-mile beach, sailing, windsurfing, diving, kayaking, rafting and restaurants and lodging for all budgets.

"George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer accused of wrongly killing Trayvon Martin, will not immediately have to turn over donations made to his website, a Florida judge said Friday. Zimmerman collected about $204,000 in donations through the website, but did not disclose the contributions during his bond hearing last week, according to his attorney, Mark O'Mara. Prosecutors had asked for a bond of $1 million, but Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. made it $150,000 after Zimmerman's family testified they did not have the resources necessary to meet the higher level. Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda on Friday asked Lester to increase the bond in light of the donations. But the judge said he would delay ruling on the request, in part because he does not know if he has authority to say how the money can be used. Lester and O'Mara both said they are concerned about releasing the names of donors to Zimmerman, who has faced threats since the case began making national headlines in March. Zimmerman, 28, was released Monday on $150,000 bail, 10% of which was put up to secure his release while he awaits trial on a second-degree murder charge in Martin's February 26 death. About $5,000 from the website contribution was used in making bond, O'Mara said. The rest came from a loan secured by a family home. Although Zimmerman spent some of the contributions on living expenses, about $150,000 remains, O'Mara said Friday. O'Mara said he has put the money into a trust he controls until a final decision is made about its use. Lester asked for additional information about the accounts but did not indicate when he would rule. ""I'm not going to make a snap decision,"" the judge said. Also during Friday's hearing, Lester declined to consider a gag order requested by prosecutors, saying it was premature and that none of the attorneys in the case had said anything to concern him so far. CNN was among the media organizations opposing the motion. O'Mara said he learned about the money this week as he and Zimmerman were trying to shut down Zimmerman's website, Facebook page and Twitter account to avoid concerns about possible impersonators and other problems. ""He asked me what to do with his PayPal accounts, and I asked him what he was talking about,"" O'Mara told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday. ""He said those were the accounts that had the money from the website he had. And there was about ... $204,000 that had come in to date."" O'Mara had said earlier this month that he believed Zimmerman had no money. Asked whether knowledge of the money might have made a difference to Lester, who presided at Zimmerman's bond hearing, O'Mara said, ""It might have."" O'Mara could not explain why Zimmerman didn't disclose the funds, but said he didn't think his client had meant to deceive anyone. ""I consider it an oversight because I don't see anything else that suggests that Mr. Zimmerman has been insincere or dishonest,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday. ""The moment I asked him about it, he acknowledged it and forwarded the money."" Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said Zimmerman's failure to reveal that he had the money shows that he is being dishonest. ""If his testimony at the bond hearing is any indication of what is to come, then the lying has already begun,"" Crump said. ""This is going to say a lot about whether Trayvon Martin can get a fair trial,"" he told Burnett. ""If he (Lester) doesn't revoke his bond, the court should severely sanction him so George Zimmerman understands you cannot lie to the court."" Separately, the attorney said the Martin family has raised less than $100,000 in fund-raising efforts to date, and that the money collected will go toward the Trayvon Martin Foundation. Crump said his firm will not collect a fee in any of the criminal proceedings. ""If we collect any money, it will be from a civil lawsuit and not from any donor money,"" he said. Zimmerman was arrested April 11 after a lengthy delay punctuated by protests and rallies nationwide calling for charges against him. Critics accuse Zimmerman of racially profiling and unjustly killing Martin, a 17-year-old African-American. Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self-defense, according to police reports. Although details of the shooting remain murky, it is known that Martin ventured out from the Sanford, Florida, home of his father's fiancee and went to a nearby convenience store, where he bought a bag of candy and an iced tea. On his way back, he had a confrontation with Zimmerman, who shot him. Zimmerman had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood, according to authorities. In the call, Zimmerman said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman pursued Martin anyway but then said he lost sight of him. According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchanged words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head onto the sidewalk, leading to the shooting. Police have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there was no evidence to disprove his account that he'd acted in self-defense. A police report indicated he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head. O'Mara on Friday revealed a new website, www.gzlegalcase.com, and another site, not yet live, that will host a defense fund. The only thing on the site Friday afternoon was a statement about the donations. Regardless of what happens to the contributions, O'Mara intends to open a legal defense fund for his client, he said. ""I've had dozens, hundreds actually, of people wanting to donate,"" he said Thursday. O'Mara, who said he charges $400 per hour for family law cases, estimated Zimmerman's defense costs could reach $1 million. ""You can really go through a lot of money on a case like this, with the intensity of it,"" he said.","George Zimmerman won't be required to immediately hand over website contributions .

"The United States is on the verge of an energy renaissance. We need to recognize and seize the opportunity. This renaissance involves domestic production of natural resources ranging from clean renewables to hydrocarbons. In particular, domestic hydrocarbon production -- both oil and gas -- is increasing dramatically, with some experts predicting that the United States could become the largest hydrocarbon producer in the word -- outstripping Saudi Arabia and Russia -- by 2020. Increased domestic production of hydrocarbons is driven by two trends. First, new technology is unlocking unconventional resources such as shale-derived oil and gas. And second, investors and policy makers are recognizing that the U.S. still has an enormous resource base of conventional oil and gas, particularly in Alaska. Opinion: Why we should look to the Arctic . Federal agencies estimate that Alaska's North Slope and federal waters off Alaska's northern coast contain approximately 40 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil and more than 200 trillion cubic feet of conventional gas. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, this region contains more oil than any comparable region located in the Arctic, including northern Russia. However, the United States is lagging behind its Arctic neighbors in developing these resources. This is unfortunate, because we have some of the highest environmental standards in the world and we should be setting the bar for Arctic development. Developing our Arctic resources will promote our nation's interests in many ways: securing a politically stable, long-term supply of domestic energy; boosting U.S. economic growth and jobs; reducing the federal trade deficit; and strengthening our global leadership on energy issues. Leading academic researchers and economists in Alaska have estimated that oil production from Alaska's outer continental shelf will bring federal revenues of approximately $167 billion over 50 years, and create 55,000 jobs throughout the country. Developing U.S. resources in the Arctic has the added benefit of enhancing global environmental protection. One of the arguments used by Arctic drilling opponents is that ""we aren't ready,"" but it is obvious that no matter what preparations are made, they will argue that it isn't enough. Shell, for example, has spent billions to prepare for drilling in the Arctic this summer, incorporating the lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, state-of-the-art equipment and extensive scientific research. Recently, the Obama administration has publically expressed its confidence in the company's drilling plans. The U.S. has created some of the highest standards in the world for environmental protection. When we delay or disallow responsible resource development, the end result is not to protect the environment, but to drive hydrocarbon investment and production to countries with much lower environmental standards and enforcement capacity. Last year, it was reported that between 5 million and 20 million tons of oil leak in Russia per year. This is equivalent to a Deepwater Horizon blowout about every two months. Russia had an estimated 18,000 oil pipeline ruptures in 2010 -- the figure for the U.S. that year was 341. If we do not pursue responsible development in the Arctic, countries such as Russia -- perhaps even China, which is interested in securing access to Arctic hydrocarbon resources -- will dominate energy production from the Arctic.  Such a scenario does not bode well for the global environment. By embracing the opportunities in the Arctic, the United States will show the world that it can be a strong leader in responsible energy development.","Estimates are that Alaska has about 40 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil .

"Political ads on the airwaves have been so pervasive this year that voters in battleground states probably see them in their sleep. But when a political spot pops up while surfing the Web, there's a good chance it's aimed right at you. The practice is called microtargeting and like a lot of marketing techniques on the Internet aimed at identifying consumer tastes and behaviors, it is an information-age approach that is helping change how political groups identify and interact with voters. Moreover, microtargeting may give pollsters, campaigns and interest groups a sharper idea of how candidates and issues may fare at the ballot box, raising concerns about personal privacy in a medium where government regulation is minimal. Obama, Romney make a mad dash in a final bid for votes . In fact, ""there is none,"" said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Anonymity has been crucial to our political process. It's the reason for the secret ballot, it's the reason the Federalist Papers were anonymous,"" he said. Surfing the Web leaves a trail of browser history that allows marketing companies to glean insight into personal interests. Do you read The New York Times or watch Fox News? Do you have children? Do you shop in high-end stores or hunt for bargains on eBay? Do you support the Sierra Club or Club for Growth? Political strategy firms like Democratic DSPolitical and Republican CampaignGrid are gathering or buying up that data. They then match it to the publicly available voter rolls that were digitized as a part of a new federal law aimed at efforts to help improve voting procedures after the ballot controversies of the 2000 election. What these firms receive is detailed information about how often a potential voter has cast a ballot in addition to data on what they read, where they shop and other consumer behavior tracked for decades off line. Jim Walsh of DSPolitical said the company has so far aggregated more than 600 million cookies -- or tags on Internet user IP addresses that track movements online -- and has worked to match them against lists of some 250 million voters in the United States. This all is aimed at helping them determine how someone might vote and then reaching them wherever they go online. Micro-targeting offers clues to early vote leads . It is so efficient and such a natural extension of direct mail that Walsh called the way microtargeting is being used today ""inevitable."" In response to privacy advocates, CampaignGrid President Jordan Lieberman and Walsh said they aren't doing anything that hasn't been done before. ""The data has been commercially available data for years -- we're not targeting you by who you voted for; we're targeting you if you tend to vote or participate in the democratic process,"" Lieberman said. And he said these strategies infringe less on privacy because they don't use names or physical mailing addresses like direct mail. ""The reality is that we are more focused on privacy and we have more privacy protections than direct mail ... has used for decades,"" Lieberman said. This they said is because lists generated from browser histories are stripped of any personal information before they are used to target potential voters. Both companies said they use a third party vendor to remove that data and match the files. Lieberman wouldn't identify CampaignGrid's vendor, calling it ""part of the special sauce."" DSPolitical and CampaignGrid aren't the only ones in the game. Final CNN/ORC national poll: It's all tied up . Google, Facebook and other data powerhouses are also in on the action, albeit in a different way. For instance, Google said it doesn't collect or allow its advertisers to use personally identifiable information, including political information, to reach potential customers or voters. But it does allow marketers, political or otherwise, to target its users based on specific demographic information. The company launched its Google Political Toolkit and campaign tools via YouTube, offering candidates the chance to ""promote your videos using Google AdWords for video to reach exactly the audience you want -- by age, gender, location or other criteria."" Facebook is also using its vast amount of personal information during the election. Currently there are more than 110,000 political Facebook pages in the United States and more than 11,000 U.S.-based pages for politicians, according to a Facebook spokesman. While Facebook doesn't hand over personally identifiable information, it does allow advertisers to seek out subsections of the population based on their preferences on Facebook. ProPublica also reported on how other search engine giants are selling their users' browser history to campaigns. What companies, who follow a model of self regulation, and campaigns are doing isn't popular with the public. When asked if they wanted ""political advertising tailored to your interests,"" 86% of Americans surveyed said they did not, according to a study from the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg school of Communication released last July. Provisional ballots could be key if Ohio margin razor thin . Sixty-four percent said their support for a candidate would decrease if they found out a candidate was microtargeting them differently than their neighbor. The study also found that 20% more respondents reacted more strongly to political targeting than they did to being targeted as a consumer. ""There's a lot to say in favor of campaigns targeting voters in this way, (but) there is a lot to be concerned about,"" said Eitan Hersh, a political science professor at Yale University who studies the impact of microtargeting on campaigns and the political process. ""People like being targeted in many ways,"" said Hersh. ""Many people like that Amazon knows what kind of books they like. If a campaign knows that you're of this religion and this race and went to college, you're likely to have a different set of values ... the campaign is likely to reach out to you on those attributes."" But there is always a danger that the campaign will misfire or that the ads will seem like ""pandering,"" Hersh said. ""The downside, of course, Is that we might not like being stereotyped,"" he explained. Still, microtargeting makes an uphill process easier for the campaigns, especially at the presidential level. ""How do you start by trying to convince 200 million people that you they should vote for you?"" asked Hersh. ""The task is hard. Data helps and permits campaigns to talk to people about issues they care about,"" he continued. And the data does help. Know your polling place . Besides ads that show up before a YouTube video or banner ads on the websites users visit, they dictate scripts that door-to-door canvassers read. They also improve efficiency of campaign voter turnout efforts and reduce costs since ads online are significantly less expensive than television spots. In the age of DVR, microtargeting can also guarantee that voters actually see campaign ads. ""We can serve a pre-roll video ad,"" Walsh said, referring to ads viewers see before videos online, ""which is great stuff, it forces you to watch it before you get to your content. The big problem for advertisers these days is that everyone is fast forwarding through their videos."" A sign of how often these ads are used by political campaigns -- ""online video inventory has been sold out,"" Lieberman said, in many of the key battleground states looking into the final days of the campaign. Privacy and civil liberties activists don't propose shutting down online advertising. Instead, they favor an opt-in versus the opt-out option currently available to consumers and voters -- a ""Do Not Track"" mechanism. Calabrese says the trick is not getting browsers to add the mechanism, but getting other Web companies to agree to it. Yahoo recently said it would not honor the ""Do Not Track"" button Microsoft is installing in Microsoft Explorer 10. Could close race produce a popular/electoral vote split? ""The pushback has been that there is a business model out there that wants to track you all the time,"" Calabrese said. ""They can wring more and more advertising dollars out of you."" But don't look for this practice to end. Lieberman says it's just the beginning. Looking toward the next election cycle, CampaignGrid signed a deal with AT&T combining  AT&T's mobile network with its online voter data files. The next frontier is to reach voters with ads on their ""IP-addressable"" television sets, serving the same targeted ads that people see online, during the commercial breaks on their favorite shows. And Lieberman says they are adding data crunching power to what he calls ""rich data sets."" As Duke political science professor Sunshine Hillygus said, ""There's no turning back on microtargeting."" Why they can't break margin of error .","Campaigns use microtargeting to reach key voting blocs in key battleground states .
Firms match voter lists to browser history to find potential voters .
Many of the largest search engine companies are in on the microtargeting game .
86% of Americans say they object to targeted political advertising ."
"(CNN) -- A long-held wish for fans of Marvel's Deadpool is finally coming true. According to studio 20th Century Fox, the comic book star will arrive in theaters with a movie of his own on February 12, 2016. This is the newest Marvel mutant to star in his own project, but he's not exactly a typical comic book hero. Deadpool's known as ""the merc with a mouth,"" a mercenary with a sarcastic sense of humor who racks up a hefty body count and routinely breaks the fourth wall in his comics. Fans expect the upcoming film will have to be rated ""R"" to do the chatty, wisecracking, sociopathic character justice. Deadpool has appeared on screen before; in 2009, he was played by a combination of Ryan Reynolds and Scott Adkins in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" Reynolds actually did some filming as the character a few years ago, and the footage leaked online right around the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, which was held in July. The teaser clip definitely indicates that the film isn't for everyone, but it's been viewed more than 700,000 times. Reynolds hasn't been officially announced as the lead, but he's been so closely identified with the character it's almost assumed he will get the part. In an interview during the recent Toronto Film Festival, he's quoted as crediting the Internet reaction to the leaked footage as giving this project the push it needed. ""The movie has been in a state of limbo for a while,"" Reynolds told The Niagara Falls Review. ""There was such an overpowering reaction to the footage, you sort of feel like, 'Oh, so we weren't crazy for our reasons for loving this character, for loving this role.' It's interesting to see the power of the Internet. It's awe-inspiring, actually."" He wasn't the only one who felt that way. One of the film's writers, Rhett Reese, actively tried to whip up fans online getting more than 50,000 people to retweet a call to support the movie. Now that Fox has announced the film, he thanked everyone with a tweet of celebration.","Studio 20th Century Fox confirms a ""Deadpool"" movie is on the way .

"The humor at the 98th annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner went to the dogs. President Barack Obama poked fun Saturday at everything, from the Secret Service scandal to the lavish spending by the Government Services Administration, to the upcoming general election. However, it was a spoof about Mitt Romney and his dog Seamus that highlighted the president's monologue. The joke recalled a political ad released by the Newt Gingrich campaign that took aim at Romney for admitting he once put his family dog in a cage and perched it on the top of his car. ""I know everybody is predicting a nasty election, and thankfully, we've all agreed that families are off-limits,"" the president said. ""Dogs, however, are apparently fair game."" The president's punch line: An ad by a phony Super PAC that featured Romney on Air Force One with a dog cage on top of the aircraft and promoted dog freedoms, while warning of Obama's policy of dog socialism. ""Under his leadership, man's best friend has been forced into automobiles. Imagine the European-style socialism that he has planned for the next four years,"" the spoof ad said. The president even poked fun at himself over recent criticism by the Romney campaign about revelations in his book, ""Dreams From My Father,"" where he revealed he was fed dog meat as a boy in Indonesia. ""That's pretty rough. But I can take it, because my stepfather always told me, it's a boy-eat-dog world out there,"" Obama said. The president referred to former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's recent guest hosting on ""Today,"" saying it ""reminds me of an old saying -- What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious."" The dinner was Obama's fourth as president. It has been a ritual in Washington since 1920, when it was first held to boost communication between the press and the president. Journalists and news organizations were well-represented at the affair, and they brought famous faces in tow. Among those in attendance Saturday were Claire Danes, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd, Sigourney Weaver, Eva Longoria, Viola Davis, Kerry Washington, Rachel Zoe, Goldie Hawn and Josh Hutcherson. The annual gala, also known as the ""Nerd Prom,"" raises money for journalism scholarships. While the dinner is notorious for its sometimes bawdy political humor, the president took a serious moment to recall the deaths of Anthony Shadid of The New York Times and Marie Colvin of the Times of London, ""who made the ultimate sacrifice as they sought to shine a light on some of the most important stories of our time."" Shadid and Colvin died in February while covering the conflict in Syria. Overall, Obama stayed true to the theme of the night -- humorous barbs. He joked about business tycoon Donald Trump, whom the president kidded at last year's dinner about pushing the president to release his long-form birth certificate. ""We gather during a historic anniversary. This weekend last year, we finally delivered justice to one of the world's most notorious individuals,"" Obama said to a packed ballroom at the Washington Hilton. A photo of Trump was shown, rather than that of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Obama then went back even further in time. ""Four years ago, I was in a brutal primary battle with Hillary Clinton,"" Obama said. ""Four years later, she won't stop drunk texting me from Cartagena,"" a reference to the city where Secret Service agents allegedly consorted with prostitutes. The president also took aim at the scandal, itself: ""I had a lot more material prepared, but I have to get the Secret Service home in time for their new curfew."" Obama, speaking before comedian Jimmy Kimmel, made light of a General Services Adminstration conference in Las Vegas that cost more than $800,000. ""Look at this party. We have men in tuxes, women in gowns, fine wine, first-class entertainment. I was relieved to hear it was not a GSA conference,"" Obama quipped. He even chided Kimmel, star of ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" ""Jimmy got his start on the 'Man Show.' In Washington, that is what we call a congressional hearing on contraception."" Kimmel, who took the stage following the president's monologue, hit back. ""Remember when the country rallied around you in the hopes of a better tomorrow?"" Kimmel asked. ""That was hilarious."" Kimmel said there was a term for ""guys like the president,"" and it wasn't two terms. He said he told the Secret Service that for $800, he would stay away from jokes about the scandal. ""But they only offered $30,"" he said. Nobody in the room was safe from Kimmel's barbs, which he fired at politicians, journalists, celebrities and corporate executives in attendance. Kimmel praised Michelle Obama's work to combat obesity with her health initiative. The comedian then pointed out rotund New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to the first lady. ""Look, it's Chris Christie. Get him,"" Kimmel said. Kimmel then took aim at Gingrich's weight. But Kimmel's fat jokes fell, well, flat with the former House speaker.","President Obama says families are off-limits during election .

"It's time for Apple to ""step up or shut up"" when it comes to launching new products, according to brand expert Jonathan Gabay. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is experimenting with iPhone screen sizes larger than the current four inches while also trying out larger iPads with a gigantic 13-inch display. The rumors, whether true or not, are ""typical Apple"" before a big earnings report, according to Gabay, who is an author and speaker on brands. Following flat smartphone sales and no low-cost product on the market, shareholders are bracing themselves for a heavy drop in profits when the company reports fiscal third-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The California-based tech giant has failed to launch any new products in the last three months and Gabay believes rivals, notably Korean-technology company Samsung, are starting to gain ground with models such as the Galaxy S4 providing a cheaper alternative. He told CNN: ""I think that since the demise of [Steve] Jobs people have been concerned about what will happen to the Apple brand. People have been anticipating something that will show that Apple is still original."" Gabay said the pressure is mounting on Apple boss Tim Cook -- who took over as chief executive officer in 2011 following the death of Jobs, the company's founder -- to come up with a product that will inject life back into the company. He added: ""The pressure is definitely there. People are looking at price as well as technology, given the economic times we're in. That gives Apple a bit of an issue because they've always been high-end market."" ""I think he [Cook] has done a great job organizing the company. But I think now people are saying 'time's up.'"" The company's problems have been well-documented over the last year.  The company's stock price has dropped 40%  over the past 10 months and in April Apple announced that earnings fell year-over-year for the first time since late 2003. However, the company is still expected to post $35 billion in sales and $6.9 billion in profit. Apple is currently the sixth largest U.S. company measured by revenue, and its sales are expected to grow by 9% in 2013.","The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is experimenting with iPhone screen sizes .

"When I read about the rape of a 23-year-old photojournalist in Mumbai, I thought, here we go again. On December 6, 1992, when I was a 29-year-old reporter covering the demolition of a mosque in northern India, I was attacked. I wasn't raped, but my attackers sexually assaulted and then tried to kill me. Someone dragged me to a trench outside the mosque and pulled my shirt off. But a passerby jumped in, fought off my attackers and saved me. When I appeared in court to testify against the attackers, their lawyers asked me questions that implied I was responsible. How could the daughter of a good family have gone to cover the demolition? Did I smoke? What kind of clothes was I wearing? Did I believe in God? The judge did not stop them. It was a demoralizing and toxic experience, but one that is not unknown to women in India who choose to speak out against sexual attacks. They are silenced by a process that heaps shame, fear and guilt on them. Indian women feel sorrow, anger at U.S. student's harassment . In rural Rajasthan in 1992, a judge dismissed charges filed by a low-caste, or Dalit, grassroots social worker, Bhanwari Devi, who said she was gang raped. She had been campaigning against child marriage. A judge said, ""a middle-aged man from an Indian village could not possibly have participated in a gang rape in the presence of his own nephew."" A judgment like this not only deters other women from testifying against their rapists, it also emboldens the attackers, who know that they will get away with it. Most women say they would never tell the police about an attack, afraid that they would be ignored or even abused by the cops themselves. Keeping chivalry alive in India: Men respond to rape crisis . In June, 13 anti-rape protesters were arrested outside the home of the West Bengal chief minister and detained for more than eight hours. Ironically, they were protesting the lack of police protection for women in the state following the rape and murder of a 20-year-old college student whose body was found lying near a river near the outskirts of Kolkata, and that of a 14-year-old girl who was raped and killed in the town of Gede, 90 miles away, only three days later. Few women want to appear in court only to be stigmatized and traumatized -- unlike treatment of the suspects. While India's legal framework has improved for women over the past 20 years, the people implementing it are mostly male cops and lawyers who live in a deeply patriarchal society. Incidents of rape have gone up by 873% in India in the past 60 years. On average, each day, three Dalit women are raped in some part of our country. The conviction rate for rape cases in 2011 was 25% -- although some estimate only one in 10 rapes is reported. The conviction rate for men accused of raping Dalit women is almost nil. The National Crime Records Bureau's annual report of crime statistics also reports disturbing findings: A woman is raped somewhere in India every 20 minutes, and the number of children raped has increased by 336% in the past 10 years. This culture of impunity is certainly one of the reasons rape has too often become the weapon of choice for frustrated young men who blame women, increasingly visible in the workplace, for their unemployment, and who hope to regain jobs by frightening women back home through sexual violence. The desire to blame women is fed by a cult of masculinity promoted by corporate and political leaders who serve as role models for the rest of society. Harassment in India: 'The story you never wanted to hear' In the course of my work with Apne Aap Women Worldwide, I have seen the steady creeping of a rape culture into the fabric of India. We work to organize women in prostitution to resist their own and their daughters' rape. The biggest challenge we face is the attitude of politicians, senior police officials, heads of foundations and even policy makers who view rape as a normal part of society. Many have told me: ""Men will be men."" Recently, when National Crime Records Bureau pegged West Bengal as the state with the highest incidence of crimes against women, the chief minister contested the bureau's statistics rather than tackling the problem. Continually, budget allocations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development are reduced. Debates to ensure equal power sharing between the sexes through the Women's Reservation Bill  have gone nowhere. But no amount of violence and intimidation is going to force women back into their homes. In fact, homes are often the places where females are in the most danger --  from the time they are conceived to old age. An average Indian female could likely be a victim of foeticide, infanticide, malnourishment, dowry, child marriage, maternal mortality, domestic servitude, prostitution, rape, honor killings and domestic violence -- simply because she is female. Equipped with better education, women are courageously taking their place in the public sphere as doctors, lawyers, journalists, bankers, politicians, farmers, teachers and more.  They are signing up for social justice movements to end the growing inequality and unemployment in our country. As yet another gang-rape victim suffers in a Mumbai hospital in India, we have to recognize the need to overhaul the criminal justice system. In December 2012, India and the world were shocked by the brutal gang rape and beating aboard a moving bus of a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who later died of massive internal injuries. It prompted desperate calls for reform, protests and close examination of India's attitudes toward rape. But after the initial outrage, it seems that the law has only changed on paper.  The rape in Mumbai might not have happened if the culture of rape was truly overcome and sexual assaults were taken seriously.","Ruchira Gupta says the rape of a photojournalist in Mumbai is not surprising .

"(CNN) -- Alaska's top two elected officials on Thursday certified Sen. Lisa Murkowski's re-election in November as a write-in candidate, clearing the way for Murkowski to be sworn in on time for the new congressional session that starts next week. Gov. Sean Parnell and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell signed the paperwork certifying Murkowski as the election winner, according to a statement by the governor's office. The papers now will be hand delivered to the secretary of the Senate in Washington before noon Monday, the deadline for Murkowski to be able to get sworn in when the Senate convenes again on January 5, the statement said. Murkowski is the first senator to win election in a write-in campaign since Strom Thurmond did it in South Carolina in 1954, and her victory followed a lengthy legal battle over the way the votes were counted. She was defeated in the Republican primary in August by Joe Miller, a Tea Party-backed candidate. Murkowski then waged the write-in campaign in the general election in November to defeat Miller, who filed a lawsuit challenging the result. On Tuesday, a federal judge dismissed Miller's lawsuit, clearing the way for final certification of the vote. Miller said he was disappointed with the ruling, adding that he still believed his challenge was on solid constitutional ground. ""Thus, we are evaluating the ruling and determining what our next step should be,"" Miller said Tuesday. After the November 2 election, Miller filed a challenge against the Division of Elections to ensure adherence to state law, which calls for write-in votes to match the name of the candidate. Miller argued that Alaska law does not allow the counting of misspelled names on write-in ballots. However, the Division of Elections set guidelines before counting began that allowed for a voter's intent to be considered when determining whether to count a ballot for a write-in candidate. Earlier this month, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the Alaska Division of Elections conducted the election according to state law. The Associated Press called the race for Murkowski last month when she had a lead of  more than 10,300 votes over Miller, a figure that included 8,159 ballots contested by Miller observers. Not including the contested ballots, Murkowski's lead still exceeded 2,100 votes. The final certified vote count had Murkowski ahead by 10,252. CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","NEW: Final vote count put Murkowski ahead by 10,252 .

"In a nondescript hotel ballroom last month at the South by Southwest Interactive festival, Andras Forgacs offered a rare glimpse at the sci-fi future of food. Before an audience of tech-industry types, Forgacs produced a plate of small pink wafers -- ""steak chips,"" he called them -- and invited people up for a taste. But these were no ordinary snacks: Instead of being harvested from a steer, they had been grown in a laboratory from tiny samples of animal tissue. One taster's verdict on this Frankenmeat? Not bad, actually. ""It was delicious. It tasted like a thin piece of beef jerky,"" said Michael Wang, a program manager in Washington. ""I would have never thought it wasn't real meat."" Forgacs is co-founder and CEO of Modern Meadow, a young company that is developing lab-engineered meat and leather products, known as cultured meat. He is among a new breed of youthful entrepreneurs who are applying tech-startup principles -- innovation, efficiency, data-driven processes -- to address the growing challenges of global food production. ""Once you start to see food as technology, as a form of hardware, you start to ask, why can't food get better?"" asked Rob Rhinehart, CEO of Rosa Labs, a nutritional-science startup based in Los Angeles. ""But there's a lot of disagreement about what our products are. Is it fake? Is it real?"" For those reasons, these biotech food entrepreneurs may face an uphill climb. To an eating public increasingly focused on organic, farm-to-table food, cultured meat -- also known as ""in vitro"" or ""test-tube"" meat -- sounds unnatural and unappealing. A recent Pew survey found that 80% of Americans would not eat meat that was grown in a lab, although younger and college-educated people are more willing to try it. ""Cultured meat is so new and such a radically different way of making meat to what has gone before,"" said Neil Stephens, a research scientist at the University of Cardiff in Wales who has been studying lab-engineered food products. ""There is an empirical question to answer about whether people will accept it as meat, and what criteria we use to define cultured meat as meat."" Problem ... and solution? As these entrepreneurs see it, our current large-scale methods of raising meat are wasteful and harmful to the environment. Research supports this: Raising livestock, for example, requires massive amounts of water, pollutes rivers with manure and, according to the United Nations, produces an estimated 14.5% of global human greenhouse-gas emissions. On top of that, global demand for meat is expected to double over the next 40 years, placing further strain on the planet's natural resources. By comparison, lab-grown meat would leave a much lighter footprint and might eventually help alleviate food shortages in some parts of the world, advocates say. They also say that cultured meat is more humane because no animals are slaughtered. ""It's the future,"" said entrepreneur Biz Stone, a vegan and co-founder of Twitter and Jelly. ""We can't sustain the current model of raising enough animals to feed 7 billion people."" Spotting an opportunity, a handful of biotechnology startups have begun developing alternative food products. Using a formula developed at the University of Missouri, Beyond Meat takes plant protein from soy and peas and applies heating, cooling and pressure to realign it so that its structure resembles meat tissue. The company's fake chicken strips are in 4,000 stores across the United States and have fooled people in blind taste tests. Hampton Creek Foods has received $30 million in funding for its business model, which revolves around a plant-based substitute for eggs. Its first product, a vegan mayonnaise called Just Mayo, hit stores in California last fall. And after a $2 million crowdfunding campaign Rosa Labs recently began mass-producing Soylent, a drink supplement aimed at meeting all the human body's nutritional needs. ""There's such a wide-open space for innovations if you're starting (a company) around food,"" said Hampton Creek Foods CEO Josh Tetrick. But the most fascinating, and polarizing, startup in this emerging space is Modern Meadow. Launched in 2011 by Forgacs and his father Gabor Forgacs, a biophysicist, the company plans to make cultured leather products before tackling the thornier process of growing meat. ""You don't waste as much material (with cultured leather) because animals don't come in the shape of a couch or a handbag,"" said Andras Forgacs at the SXSW panel discussion in Austin, Texas. To make cultured beef, Modern Meadow takes muscle cells from a steer and places them in a liquid or gel containing amino acids, vitamins, minerals and sugars -- ingredients that cells feed on -- to stimulate tissue growth. Scientists flavor the Modern Meadow steak chips by adding sauces, like teriyaki or barbecue, before cooking them in a food dehydrator. The process takes about a week. ""We basically have a team of scientists who developed this,"" said Andras Forgacs, adding that each chip can be made for less than $100. Costs will go down as production ramps up, he said. That's still a lot cheaper than the world's first lab-grown burger, which was engineered by a scientist in the Netherlands and served to food critics at a news conference last August in London. (Reviews of the burger were mixed.) The project, funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, cost some $325,000. A cultural challenge . Manufacturing and cost barriers, plus the pokey federal regulatory process, mean that test-tube steaks won't be coming to your neighborhood supermarket anytime soon. But they are coming, entrepreneurs say. ""We're in for a real revolution in the next decade or two,"" Forgacs said. Added Tetrick, ""By 2030 we're going to see a drastic shift."" They and their fellow biotech entrepreneurs still face plenty of stumbling blocks. There's the issue of health: While lab-grown meat would likely be freer of bacteria and pesticides, its production also may require the use of artificial growth hormones. Then there's the challenge of making consumers comfortable with eating meat that comes from a laboratory. And if cultured meat doesn't taste good, nobody will try it more than once. ""It's not the science that's the most difficult part. The hardest part is our culture. We've been eating meat for 2 million years,"" said Ethan Brown, CEO of Beyond Meat. But, he added, ""You can see the change coming when you sit down and talk to a child. No child wants to hurt an animal."" Not surprisingly, the U.S. beef industry is not excited by the prospect of lab-grown meat. ""We feel confident that consumers will continue to trust and prefer traditionally raised (not lab-engineered) beef. No laboratory product will ever be able to take the place of cattlemen and women or the dedication they have to the customer, the consumer, or to rural America,"" said Chase Adams, spokesman for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. ""Regardless of market, I do not foresee engineered beef as a viable or attractive option for consumers."" Stephens, the University of Cardiff researcher, believes the idea of cultured meat is still too new for most people to wrap their heads around. Is it really meat, or is it something else? ""If you ask the biologists working on it ... many of them will tell you it will be meat when the material composition of the cultured meat is sufficiently similar to traditional meat,"" he said. ""I am a sociologist, so to me the meaning of something is not defined by its material properties but by how society more broadly makes sense of ... (it). ""Cultured meat is still very new in the public imagination, and I think many people are still working out what they think about it.""","Tech entrepreneurs are addressing the challenges of global food production .

"Another suspected suicide bombing struck the southern Russian city of Volgograd on Monday, killing at least 14 people and further highlighting Russia's security challenges as it prepares to host the Winter Olympics in less than six weeks. The explosion hit a trolleybus near a busy market during the morning rush hour, a day after a blast at Volgograd's main train station killed 17 people and wounded at least 35. Vladmir Markin, a spokesman for the country's federal investigation agency, told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti that both explosions were terrorist attacks. ""This strike, which was cynically planned for the period of preparations for New Year's celebrations, is one more attempt by terrorists to open a domestic front, sow panic and chaos, and trigger religious strife and conflicts in Russian society,"" said a statement Monday by Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry. ""We will not back down and will continue our tough and consistent offensive"" against terrorists, the ministry's statement said, adding that such an enemy ""can only be stopped by joint efforts"" involving the international community. The approaching Olympics . No one claimed responsibility for the Volgograd blasts, but they occurred several months after the leader of a Chechen separatist group pledged violence to disrupt the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics that begin on February 7. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach condemned the bombings as ""a despicable attack on innocent people. ""The entire international movement joins me in utterly condemning this cowardly act,"" Bach said in a statement, adding that he wrote Russian President Vladimir Putin to express condolences as well as ""our confidence in the Russian authorities to deliver safe and secure Games in Sochi."" Meanwhile, the United States offered its ""full support to the Russian government in security preparations for the Sochi Olympic Games,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement. ""We would welcome the opportunity for closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators, and other participants,"" Hayden said. Volgograd is a major rail hub in southern Russia and a main transit point for people traveling by train to Sochi on the Black Sea, just over 400 miles (645 kilometers) to the southwest. Each day, thousands of passengers use the station in the city once called Stalingrad. Two blasts in two days . Video footage from the scene Monday showed the twisted shell of a blue trolleybus, with debris spread around it. The impact of the blast blew out the roof of the bus, as well as windows of several nearby houses. At least 28 people were reported to be wounded, with several in serious condition, including one 6-month-old child, RIA Novosti reported. Based on the footage, the blast appeared to have occurred in the back half of the bus. The federal investigation agency said it believes the explosion was set off by a male suicide bomber. Investigators said the train station blast Sunday also appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber. Markin told RIA Novosti that DNA testing will be carried out on the remains of the station bomber, who used the equivalent of 22 pounds (10 kilograms) of TNT in a device containing shrapnel. Investigators said they also found an unexploded grenade at the scene. Video taken from an outside security camera showed a huge fireball inside what appears to be the main entrance of the three-story stone building, followed by a steady trail of smoke coming out of shattered windows. Russia's security challenge . In July, Doku Umarov, the leader of the Chechen group Caucasus Emirate, released a video statement in which he vowed to unleash ""maximum force"" to disrupt the games at Sochi. The U.S. State Department considers the Caucasus Emirate a foreign terrorist group and has authorized a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of Umarov. The State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. His group also claimed responsibility for the 2011 bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 36 people, the 2010 bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40 and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died. In October, a bomber blew up a passenger bus in Volgograd, killing six people and wounding more than 30 others. Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for that attack. ""Most of the militants responsible for terrorist attacks in Russia over the last decade -- including female suicide bombers who have taken part in 20 attacks claiming at least 780 lives since June 2000 -- have come from Dagestan,"" RIA Novosti reported Monday. The two young men behind the Boston Marathon bombings lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and one of them visited the area the year before the attack. ""Radical Islamist groups tied to the war against the Russian state now have much deeper roots, and are far more active, in Dagestan than in Chechnya,"" Rajan Menon, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a CNN.com column. What might be behind the attacks? Putin has maintained that the Sochi games will be safe and security will be tight. Visitors to Sochi and the surrounding area are subjected to rigorous security checks, and vehicle license plates are monitored. ""This will probably be one of the most difficult Olympics to actually go as a spectator and watch the Games because of the myriad layers of security,"" Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York told CNN on Monday. Other parts of Russia . However, the Volgograd explosions showed the challenge that Russian authorities face in policing the rest of the country amid ongoing unrest in the North Caucasus. That region includes Chechnya, where Russia fought two wars against separatist movements, and Dagestan. With tight security around Sochi itself, terrorists are believed to be focusing on other parts of the North Caucasus and southern Russia. RIA Novosti reported a car bomb killed three people on Friday in Pyatigorsk in southern Russia, about 160 miles (270 kilometers) east of Sochi. ""Rarely do you actually have a terrorist group come out and say, 'We're going to try and disrupt these games,'"" CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said Monday. ""When al Qaeda-related affinity groups make these sort of statements, you've got to take them at their word."" The fact that the bombers are targeting transportation is ""not lost on Olympic Committee organizers and security officials,"" she added. Athletes are ""most vulnerable"" when moving between the Olympic Village and the sites of their events, she said. Townsend, who coordinated with Greek officials before the Olympics in Athens in 2004, said security officials all over the world will be asking Russia for detailed information about these attacks, including whether there were any indications or warnings. They'll also ask about what information Russian intelligence has on the capabilities of terrorist groups to pull off further attacks.","U.S. legislator says spectators will face tight Olympics security .

"(CNN) -- President Obama unveiled plans Wednesday to open large swaths of U.S. coastal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico to oil and natural gas drilling -- a move likely to please the energy industry but upset the administration's environmentalist supporters. The administration plan would include lifting a 20-year ban on drilling off the Virginia coastline, while putting the clamps on sites such as southwest Alaska's Bristol Bay. Parts of the Arctic Ocean off Alaska's North Slope, however, could be accessed. The plan authorizes the Interior Department to conduct seismic surveys off the south- and mid-Atlantic coasts to ""determine the quantity and location of potential oil and gas resources to support energy planning,"" according to a statement from a White House official. What are your hopes for the environment? Roughly two-thirds of available oil and gas resources in the eastern Gulf of Mexico would be opened to drilling if a congressional moratorium on oil and gas operations in the region is lifted, according to the statement. Drilling would occur more than 125 miles off the Florida coast. ""This is not a decision that I've made lightly,"" Obama told an audience at Maryland's Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility. ""But the bottom line is this: Given our energy needs, in order to sustain economic growth and produce jobs and keep our businesses competitive, we're going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable, homegrown energy."" The president was joined during his remarks by the secretaries of the interior, energy and the Navy, as well as the chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. GOP leaders have pushed strongly for additional domestic drilling to lessen America's dependence on outside energy sources. One top Republican, however, argued Obama's plan does not go far enough. ""It's long past time for this administration to stop delaying American energy production off all our shores,"" said House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""Opening up areas off the Virginia coast to offshore production is a positive step, but keeping the Pacific Coast and Alaska, as well as the most promising resources of the Gulf of Mexico, under lock and key makes no sense at a time when gasoline prices are rising and Americans are asking 'Where are the jobs?' "" A top Senate Democrat also ripped the decision, arguing it could harm marine life while damaging the economy in coastal communities. ""Giving Big Oil more access to our nation's waters is really a 'Kill, Baby, Kill' policy,"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey. ""It threatens to kill jobs, kill marine life and kill coastal economies that generate billions of dollars. Offshore drilling isn't the solution to our energy problems, and I will fight this policy and continue to push for 21st-century clean-energy solutions."" Environmentalists critical of Obama drilling plan . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, warned that any offshore or onshore plan should proceed in an environmentally and fiscally responsible manner. ""Taxpayers who own these resources have been historically shortchanged from the huge profits received from drilling on public lands, and must receive a fair return in the future,"" she said. Another key Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, praised the move, calling it ""good news and a positive step forward as we work to expand our nation's domestic energy production."" ""Moving forward on the mid-Atlantic offshore proposal will provide an opportunity to determine the scope of our region's offshore energy resources, the economic viability of accessing those resources and the potential impacts on our environmental and national security priorities,"" he said. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, joined Warner in enthusiastically backing the decision. ""Virginians will benefit from the thousands of jobs that will be created and the economic activity and development that will accompany this vital industry's arrival in the state,"" McDonnell said in a statement. Obama sought to portray his decision as politically pragmatic and centrist, balancing the country's growing energy needs and environmental concerns. The administration has been ""guided not by political ideology, but by scientific evidence,"" he said. ""We need to move beyond the tired debates between right and left, between business leaders and environmentalists, between those who would claim drilling is a cure-all and those who would claim it has no place. Because this issue is just too important to allow our progress to languish while we fight the same old battles over and over again."" The president warned that increased drilling could only be a partial solution at best. The United States controls less than 2 percent of the world's oil reserves but accounts for more than 20 percent of global oil consumption, he noted. White House spokesmen Bill Burton and Ben LaBolt said the announcement was being made at Andrews -- the home base of presidential airplane Air Force One -- because it's an appropriate place to discuss energy security. In addition to discussing his plans for offshore drilling, Obama talked about the importance of making greater use of biofuels. The U.S. Air Force is the Pentagon's largest consumer of jet fuel, consuming 2.4 billion gallons annually, according to Burton and LaBolt. The Air Force, however, is attempting to transition to a greater use of alternative fuels. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation are set to sign an agreement Thursday establishing fuel economy standards for cars and trucks for model years 2012 to 2016. ""We are implementing policies that will greatly reduce our dependence on foreign oil,"" the official said, noting the White House is leading by example and will announce the purchase of 5,000 hybrid vehicles for the federal fleet. CNN's Dan Lothian, Suzanne Malveaux, Deirdre Walsh, Alan Silverleib, Lisa Desjardins and Erika Dimmler contributed to this report.","One Democratic senator slams the plan while another praises it .

"At least 31 people were killed and nearly 300 injured on Friday in the bloodiest day in the Libyan capital since the fall of Tripoli in 2011, according to figures released by the government. Fighting broke out after protesters marched on the Tripoli headquarters of militias from the coastal city of Misrata. Protesters and eyewitnesses said militiamen opened fire on the hundreds who marched on Gharghour, a southern district of the capital where Misrata militia are based, in an effort to evict the armed groups. TV footage aired on the privately owned al-Nabaa channel showed militiamen, in what appeared to be an antiaircraft cannon mounted on a truck, opening fire directly at protesters. The situation escalated into an armed confrontation that lasted for hours as protesters returned with weapons and militiamen from different parts of the capital. The sound of heavy gunfire, artillery and explosions echoed across Tripoli after nightfall. The scene at Tripoli's overwhelmed hospitals was one of chaos and grief, as women wailed and a constant stream of ambulances delivered injured men, women and children. ""The scenes in trauma hospitals across Tripoli resembled a war zone tonight: frantic health staff rushing to provide help, armed men nervously patrolling corridors, and families desperately trying to find their loved ones "" Said Hanan Salah, a Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch, who visited a number of the capital's main hospitals. In a statement released on Friday night, the Libyan government described the protest as a ""peaceful"" event that came under fire when it entered Gharghour. ""The government asked the people to go out and protest across the country to reject armed brigades in cities, especially in Tripoli. We salute the peaceful protest that came out today, it was an unarmed protest that had obtained the government's permission"" the statement said. A commander of a Misrata militia speaking by phone to state TV claimed that protesters had opened fire first and one militiaman was killed from gunshots he said came from nearby rooftops. Al-Taher Basha Agha said the armed groups had agreed to leave the capital once the country's constitution was passed, but Friday's violence had changed their position. ""By God, we will not leave, we will only leave in our coffins,"" the commander said. Militiamen from Misrata and a number of other Libyan cities came into Tripoli during the fight for the capital in August 2011 and have created bases in different parts of the capital where they have remained since. Friday's protest partly organized by the Tripoli Local Council comes after heavy fighting in the heart of the capital last week between the Misrata militiamen and other groups from Tripoli. Anger against the various militias has been mounting for months in Tripoli and other Libyan parts of the country, including the eastern city of Benghazi that has been gripped by increasing violence, including political assassinations. Libya's weak central government has not been able to rein in militia groups with various regional, tribal and political loyalties. The government has been struggling with its plans to build an army and police. Many militia are on the state's payroll but continue to operate freely, with no government control. Last month, Prime Minister Ali Zaidan was kidnapped by a militia in the capital and released a few hours later by another militia. Tensions were running high in Tripoli on Friday night and many Libyans were concerned that the violence could be the start of further unrest after grieving families bury their dead on Saturday. ""The cycle of violence has hit a peak tonight with tens dead and hundreds injured. As long as militias and armed groups are not held to account for crimes they commit, innocent people will continue to die,"" Human Rights Watch's Salah told CNN. ""The government has a responsibility here to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice and hold them accountable for their acts.""","At least 31 people killed in fighting, health minister says .

"Deforestation is a term that is used a lot in environmental reporting and it's easy to forget exactly what that word means. One of the reasons why we came to Sumatra was to help people understand what deforestation looks like and why it's a problem from the perspective of those on the ground watching it happen. When it comes to deforestation in Indonesia, it has had a devastating effect. WWF estimates that half of Sumatra's forest cover has disappeared from 1985 to 2008. The forest cover has gone from 50% to 25%. That means, within my lifetime, the landscape of the island of Sumatra has completely changed. Deforestation means taking a forest and destroying it. All of the trees, plants, insects, animals and people who live there are either killed or forced to find a new home. Once a forest is cut down, the plant species all are gone. Insects and animals might make it out to find new homes, but that might include areas populated by humans, making their survival questionable. Read more: Indonesia's indigenous villages in flux . The indigenous people who live in the forest have to relocate to another area of forest or out of the forest altogether. This is a complete life change. The infrastructure, the way they provide for their families and the very basic way they live their lives would be completely different. Deforestation in Indonesia is a byproduct of industrial attempts to sell timber or plant a palm oil or acacia plantation. In essence, these forests are cut down to make money. But money is important, so a compromise needs to be reached. There has to be a way to make money without destroying forests, wildlife habitat and indigenous peoples' way of life. Indonesia is trying to do the right thing. The government has halted the cutting of virgin forest, also known as primary forest. This is untouched forest that has never been logged. Thirty Hills National Park was created in the 1990s to protect some of the rainforest. It is almost 144,000 hectares, but represents only a small portion of Sumatra's rainforest. Much of the forested areas of Sumatra that are not privately owned or protected like Thirty Hills National Park are a patchwork of land divided up into concessions. These patches of forest are owned by the government and leased to different companies for different uses. Unfortunately, many of those uses involve cutting down critical wildlife habitat. Interactive: Mission to save Sumatra's rainforest . Peter Pratje, Indonesian Director for the Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) has released more than 140 endangered Sumatran orangutans (mostly former pets) into the area of the rainforest near Thirty Hills. The intention was for the orangutans to roam free in the national park, but orangutans don't respect human boundaries. They prefer the lowlands, areas surrounding Thirty Hills that are industrial concessions. These areas have been selectively logged, taking out the larger trees for timber. Conservationists think of it as an acceptable compromise. This process also allows fruit trees to thrive and multiply. Orangutans are herbivores who prefer a diet of fruit, so they naturally migrate to those lowland areas. Leasing these lands to industries that would clear cut this forest would deeply affect this small orangutan population. It could undo all the work Peter and his orangutan team have accomplished over the past decade. Orangutans are not the only animals affected by deforestation. Critically endangered Sumatran elephants and tigers like the lowlands too. But this area isn't what's protected. The lowland is a moneymaker. It's easier to navigate than the hilly areas, making it prime land for logging and pulp or palm oil plantations. Sometimes the government concludes the economic benefits are greater than the conservation needs. But NGOs like WWF and FZS are hoping to change minds about the importance of these concessions being marked for conservation. The hope is  to save the critical areas and find other patches of land less ideal for wildlife or indigenous people that can still generate an economic benefit.","Jenni Watts produced Expedition: Sumatra, CNN's new environment special .

"The JetBlue pilot who was locked out of his cockpit and tackled by passengers after an apparent in-flight meltdown seven months ago will be freed. U.S. District Court Judge Mary Lou Robinson ruled Friday that Clayton Osbon should be released under the conditions that he continues mental health treatment as prescribed and does not try to get a pilot's license, get on a plane without the court's permission or communicate with anyone who was on his last flight. Osbon was flying an A320 aircraft from New York to Las Vegas on March 27 when, according to court documents, he started acting erratic, telling air traffic control to be quiet and saying things such as ""we're not going to Vegas"" and ""we're all going down."" When he left the cockpit, the co-pilot changed the door lock and directed passengers to tackle Osbon and restrain him until the plane made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas, where he was arrested. Passengers captured some of the confrontation on cell phone cameras. Pilot breakdown draws attention to mental health standards . In July, Osbon was found not guilty by reason of insanity but was kept in custody for mental health treatment at a federal medical center in Fort Worth, Texas. The next month, the court was notified that he had ""suffered a psychotic episode"" and requested that his time in the facility be extended. In Robinson's order releasing Obson, she notes a new report from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons found that Osbon's release ""would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another, a finding to which neither the Government or the defendant objects."" The exact date of his release is not specified, but the Bureau of Prisons is ordered to free him after making arrangements including ""mental health aftercare"" and assigning him a probation officer. More than two dozen passengers on the flight are suing JetBlue for negligence in allowing Osbon to fly. That civil case continues.","Pilot Clayton Osbon to be released but must continue treatment .

"The whereabouts of ousted Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan were a mystery Wednesday after he flew out of the country the night before, despite a prosecutor's order he not leave after his removal from office. Zeidan was in Malta late Tuesday on a refueling stop for about two hours while en route to ""another European country,"" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said in televised remarks. As of Wednesday, it was unclear which country that was or if he had arrived there. Libya's acting Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Abdullah al-Thinni told reporters Wednesday that -- despite the prosecutor's order -- there was no ban and Zeidan was free to leave. ""If there is a warrant ... if he is wanted by the judiciary, he can return and be held accountable according to the law and international norms.  And this is not considered fleeing,"" al-Thinni said, contradicting an earlier statement from the Ministry of Justice. Hours earlier, the North African country's parliament dismissed the prime minister after rebels in eastern Libya said a tanker loaded with oil from a port under their control escaped a naval blockade and moved into international waters. Libya's prosecutor general said in Tripoli he had banned Zeidan from traveling abroad because of an investigation relating to a payment the government allegedly made last year to an armed group blocking oil ports in the east. A copy of the travel ban, dated March 11, was posted on his press office's Facebook page marked ""urgent and important."" ""We order placing the aforementioned in the monitoring database and banning him from travel until he appears for the investigation,"" said the order, addressed to the head of Libya's immigration department. Oil chaos . The vote of no-confidence came after Zeidan's failure to stop rebels from exporting oil independently, the latest challenge in the vast desert nation's bumpy transition. The Libyan government said late Monday it had taken control of the North Korean-flagged tanker, Morning Glory, as it tried to leave the Al-Sidra port in eastern Libya, and after having briefly exchanged fire with rebels. However, in a sign of the chaos and conflicting information typical for Libya, the rebels rejected the assertion. On Wednesday, al-Thinni said the tanker was at sea where Libyan military forces fired on it until they were called off by the U.S. Navy for fear of an environmental disaster. The oil tanker managed to sail away despite a fire on board, he said. A spokesman for Egypt's military, Col. Ahmed Ali, said on Wednesday that its navy will monitor Egyptian waters for the oil tanker. If the Egyptian navy finds the Morning Glory in Egyptian waters, authorities will demand to board and inspect the vessel to verify that the ship's cargo is legal and properly authorized, Ali said. Egyptian authorities will detain the ship if they find it to be violating of any laws or regulations. A North Korean state news agency said that while the ship had been temporarily flagged in North Korea, it is operated by the Golden East Logistics Company in Alexandria, Egypt. KCNA also wrote that North Korea notified the International Maritime Organization that the ship owners had violated North Korean law. It said Pyongyang had canceled and deleted the ship's registry. Oil slump . Oil production, Libya's economic lifeline, has slowed to a trickle since the summer as armed protesters have seized oil ports and oil fields to press political and financial demands. Oil revenue in the first two months of the year was only 16% of what was expected in the budget, Deputy Oil Minister Omar Shukmak said. They are seeking a greater share of the country's oil revenue, as well as autonomy for eastern Libya. Al-Thinni said the military would not fight the protesters in the ports. ""There will be no use of force against Libyan citizens,"" he said. The conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears Libya may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped oust Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 but now do as they please. The removal of Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, deepens the turmoil in the country of 6 million people.","State media in North Korea says temporary registry for tanker has been canceled .

"Three Republicans with lofty aspirations nearly had their political careers derailed over  risky positions on immigration. But the crisis on the southern border involving an influx of nearly 60,000 migrant children this year from Central America may help Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Rick Perry repair a broken trust on immigration with conservatives. All three are positioning themselves in a way that could help them make peace. Perry, as governor of Texas, is out in front publicly since his state is directly affected, while Rubio, a Florida senator, and Bush, a former Florida governor, have been relatively quiet. And Republican strategist Ana Navarro said that's OK. ""I don't think you have to play a leading role on every issue,"" she said. Rubio took a risk . Both Rubio and Bush have been leaders on immigration in the past. Rubio took a risk last year by taking a leadership role in crafting a comprehensive reform bill that passed the Senate but crashed and burned in the House. Conservatives attacked him for supporting ""amnesty,"" their opinion of providing a path to legal status for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States. Rubio then distanced himself from the Senate package that he helped broker in favor of a piecemeal approach backed by some House Republicans that also has gone nowhere. Bush: a compassionate tone . Bush offered a compassionate tone to the immigration debate before the border crisis made headlines. In April, he said many immigrants come to the United States illegally as ""an act of love"" and ""an act of commitment to your family."" He admitted that he might be stepping on a land mine before he made the statement. ""But the way I look at this, and I'm going to say this, and it'll be on tape and so be it."" Now avoiding risk . Bush, whose immigration stance is at odds with many in his party, has avoided risk by not  addressing the southern border issue until now. In a statement to CNN, Bush placed the onus on President Barack Obama to address the situation but also said the minor immigrants, many of them who crossed the border unaccompanied, should be sent home. That's in line with many Republicans, especially conservatives, as well as the stated position of the White House. How that is accomplished most effectively, however, is a sticking point at the moment. ""It is clear we have a humanitarian crisis on our border. Governor Bush believes President Obama must step up and show leadership. These children must be returned to their home countries,"" his spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, said. Bush then pushed for an immigration overhaul. ""Ultimately, we must overhaul this nation's broken immigration system to prevent situations like this in the future,"" Campbell said. Bush has been active in the political arena, however, recently endorsing and campaigning with Senate candidate Scott Brown, a Republican running in the first presidential primary state of New Hampshire. Immigrants or refugees? A different with political consequences . Quiet, but not skirting the issue . As Congress is tasked with coming up with a solution to the border crisis. Rubio has mostly taken a back seat. That's a different tactic than he took during immigration reform, where he was a leader in crafting the Senate bill. The Florida senator has put out 80 press releases since the beginning of June. But not one has addressed the border situation. But the son of Cuban immigrants hasn't completely skirted the issue, either. In an interview with a Fox affiliate in Orlando this month, Rubio said the children must be treated with compassion, but like Bush and the White House believe ""they will have to return."" Rubio also said he's opposed to Obama's $3.7 billion emergency funding request to Congress that includes money to care for immigrant kids while they await legal proceedings to determine whether they can stay in the country. Rubio said money needs to be spent on ""permanent border security measures."" He also told conservative talk show host Ed Morrissey that the current immigration crisis should be ""a catalyst"" for securing the border. Perry's approach . Perry's 2012 presidential run nosedived in part after he said in a GOP debate that people who don't support giving children of undocumented immigrants in-state college tuition don't ""have a heart."" Perry has been far more aggressive than Rubio and Bush with his state Ground Zero in the migrant crisis. Republicans have followed his lead. He confronted the White House and made his points directly to Obama in a meeting this month. Perry also has checked the ""secure border"" box. ""If you have a patient who is bleeding profusely, the first thing you have to do is stop the bleeding, and that's the reason we have been so adamant about securing the border,"" Perry said recently on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" Although he supported a secure border before, his laser-like focus on the issue during the current crisis, despite the numerous other factors that are involved, has endeared him to  reform skeptics. The lay of the land . While the three have adopted different strategies and their professional roles are different, they are positioning themselves in a way that may appease many Republican voters. While more Republicans than Democrats support border security as a solution, the conservative position has become even firmer since the border crisis began. According to a Gallup poll this week, 17% of Americans think immigration is the most important issue facing the country right now.  And Pew poll found that most Americans think the children involved should be deported. In addition, Pew found fewer Republicans supported a path to citizenship -- 64%-  in February compared to 54% now. And among the more conservative part of the Republican base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago.

"Libya and its fledgling security forces, overwhelmed by militia violence and unrest since the overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi two years ago, are going to get some help from the U.S. military, a top American commander said. Adm. William McRaven, head of the U.S. Special Operations Command, said Saturday the United States will train 5,000 to 7,000 conventional troops as well as counterterrorism forces. Another U.S. official told CNN the training is likely to take place in Europe once all the details are finalized. A major challenge will be developing a security force that's not influenced by the well-armed militias that have proliferated in the lawless atmosphere across Libya. Mourning in Tripoli a day after dozens are killed . ""As we go forward to try and find a good way to build up the Libyan security forces so they are not run by militias, we are going to have to assume some risks,"" McRaven said. ""As a country, we have to say there is probably some risk that some of the people we will be training with do not have the most clean record. At the end of the day, it is the best solution we can find to train them to deal with their own problems."" He made the remarks at a defense forum at the Reagan Presidential Library in California just a day after deadly fighting in the capital, Tripoli, on Friday. State news said at least 43 people were killed and hundreds of others were wounded during clashes. Popular sentiment against the various militias has been mounting for months in Tripoli and other parts of the country, including the eastern city of Benghazi, which has been gripped by increasing violence, including political assassinations. The chaos in Libya hit home for Americans after U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed on September 11, 2012, in an attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi. The United States has offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of anyone involved in the attack. While U.S. authorities have filed charges in the case, no one has been arrested. A NATO air campaign helped overthrow Gadhafi two years ago, but ever since there has been widespread unrest and poor security. ""The United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and the European Union have done little to follow through with an effective Libya restructural policy. They have struggled to coordinate support to address the problems with Libya's security sector and justice system,"" a Human Rights Watch report said in September.

"OK, at this point, who doesn't have a music streaming service? According to a new report, Amazon will be entering the crowded field this summer, joining such rivals as Google, Microsoft and Apple in trying to find new, profitable ways for digital users to get their tunes. The company plans to make on-demand music streaming available as part of its Prime service by June or July, according to BuzzFeed, which cited five unnamed music-industry sources in its report. Prime will, at least initially, restrict its music offerings to songs and albums that are at least 6 months old, according to the report. Even with a $20 price increase in March that bumped its annual cost to $99, many users already considered Amazon Prime one of the Web's best bargains. For $8.25 per month, members get two-day shipping on many purchases and the ability to borrow Kindle books and watch streaming movies and TV shows for free. Before March, the price of Prime hadn't changed since it debuted nine years ago. Free music streaming would be one more reason for people to sign up and, perhaps more important to Amazon, would keep them in the company's corner of the Internet, where spending money is always just a click away. The move comes as consumer tastes are veering sharply in the direction of streaming as opposed to outright purchases. Digital music sales were down roughly 13% in the first quarter of this month, according to Nielsen. Meanwhile, revenues for subscription streaming services were up 51% in 2013. The market is led by Pandora, the Internet radio service that's the most popular music-streaming platform in the United States, and Spotify, an on-demand service that has a large following in Europe. But Web heavyweights are muscling into their turf as well. Google Play, Microsoft's Xbox Music and Apple's iTunes Radio all offer free streaming or monthly subscription plans. And this week, Apple confirmed plans to buy Beats Electronics and Beats Music. Much of the focus has been on Apple's pickup of the trendy headphones that millions already use with their iPods and iPhones. But Apple also gets a music-streaming service that, although it has only about 500,000 users so far, has been praised by critics for a suggestion engine that combines a complex algorithm with human curation.

"Hacker group Anonymous began its promised week of Christmas hacks, assaulting a long list of targets. The first Anonymous hack resulted in stolen emails and credit card data from Stratfor, an Austin-based think tank that concentrates on security issues. One alleged conspirator said the goal was to use that credit card data to steal a million dollars, and give the money away as Christmas donations, the AP reports. Online images, posted to Twitter, show receipts from the donations. Twitter account @YourAnonNews, which is supposedly linked to the group, tweeted Sunday that the reason it was able to steal the credit card data was because it had not been encrypted by Stratfor -- an embarrassing mistake for a company specializing in security. Among the private clients on Stratfor's tightly-guarded list -- whose information Anonymous says it accessed -- are the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force and the Miami Police Department. The list also includes banks, law enforcement agencies, defense contractors, and technology firms such as Apple and Microsoft, the AP reports. Anonymous also posted images showing receipts of charitable donations made to non-profits. One theft victim, Alan Barr of Austin, did not know his credit card data had been stolen until an AP reporter called him for comment. ""It was all charities, the Red Cross, CARE, Save the Children. So when the credit card company called my wife she wasn't sure whether I was just donating,"" Barr said. @YourAnonNews tweeted that Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift were among the next targets. What do you think of Anonymous's ironic first target of the week? Who's next? UPDATE: A press release is circulating, saying that the Stratfor hack is not the work of Anonymous. However, it is difficult to tell who is correct.","'Anonymous' hackers hit security group .

"The United States and its allies are steeling themselves for what an American defense official described Thursday as a yearslong fight against the so-called Islamic State, a revelation that came as airstrikes pummeled oil refineries in Syria used by the terror group to help fund its operations . ""I think we are in this for a matter of years,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN on Thursday. ""... We are steeling ourselves for that period of time."" U.S.-led airstrikes hit locations overnight in a remote area of eastern Syria where ISIS has been using mobile refineries to produce oil that brings in up to $2 million a day for the group. The U.S. military was still assessing the damage to the refineries by the airstrikes, Kirby said. The attacks are focused on the ""infrastructure around the refineries,"" meaning the ability of ISIS to produce oil, he said. Even so, there are questions about just how much impact the destruction of the refineries will have on ISIS, which analysts have said has access to billions of dollars. ""Even if we stop their oil flow today, they still have about a billion dollars in the bank,"" retired U.S. Army Col. Peter Mansoor said. ""They seized about a third of a billion dollars from the central bank of Mosul (Iraq)."" On top of that, he added, ISIS has garnered millions of dollars in ransoms from European governments for hostages and have traded much of their oil. For now, the United States is focused on the refineries, according to Kirby. But he acknowledged there are ""other economic levers the international community is going to have to pull"" to cut off all funding to ISIS. At least 14 militants and five civilians were killed in the overnight airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a dissident monitoring group. ISIS targets in Iraq were also hit Thursday morning by France's military, government spokesman Stephane Le Foll told reporters in Paris. Fighter jets carried out strikes on four ISIS warehouses near Fallujah, which were believed to house military equipment. Human rights lawyer executed . The news came as reports surfaced that ISIS fighters carried out a public execution of a well-known human rights lawyer, who took to Facebook to criticize the group's destruction of mosques, churches and shrines in Iraq. Calling the torture and killing of Sameera Al-Nuiamy savage and cowardly, U.N. special representative for Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, said the Iraqi government and the international community must do all they can to ensure those responsible for her death are brought to justice. Al-Nuiamy was reportedly abducted from her home in Mosul on September 17 and put on trial before a Sharia court, which Mladenov says found her guilty of apostasy. ""She was then held for a further five days during which she was subjected to torture in an attempt to force her to repent before she was executed in public,"" he said. Since August, ISIS has beheaded American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines, gruesomely showing their killings in videos posted online. On Thursday,  FBI Director James Comey said that the United States believes it has identified the ISIS militant in the video showing Foley's killing. Officials believe the same masked militant speaks in all three beheading videos. Comey did not identify the man. ISIS overruns Iraqi base . The reports about the execution came as new details emerged about the killing of up to 300 Iraqi soldiers in Iraq's western Anbar province after ISIS fighters overran the base near Falluja this week. A handful of survivors who escaped from Saqlawiyah, which had been under siege for a week, accused the Iraqi government of failing to respond to pleas for help in the days leading up to Monday's final ISIS assault on the base. One soldier recounted in a video posted to YouTube how he and his comrades battled the fighters for hours before starting to run out of ammunition and then being shot by a sniper. ""I called the commander ... for support, but no one responded,"" he said. While CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the claims in the video, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered an investigation into what happened and why the soldiers were left to fend for themselves. At least 113 soldiers were killed and another 78 are missing, according to Iraqi security officials. The report has raised questions about whether the Iraqi military can defeat ISIS on the ground even with help from the United States and its allies in the air. There are similar questions being asked about Syria's moderate rebel groups, which have been battling President Bashar al-Assad's forces and ISIS. ISIS leadership dispersed? ISIS has likely dispersed much of its command-and-control capabilities in Syria, and leaders are now ""mixed in with the civilian population,"" Mansoor said. ""So it's unlikely these airstrikes have crippled ISIS,"" he said. ""As the President has said, it's going to be a long campaign, and it will be months -- perhaps years -- before ISIS is dealt a serious blow absent any sort of ground force to go in and root them out on the ground."" In the latest round of strikes targeting ISIS refineries in Syria, fighter jets from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates flew alongside U.S. aircraft, hitting 12 locations, Kirby said. While ISIS has been the focus of most of the strikes in Syria, other terror targets have been hit. The U.S. military said the al Qaeda-linked Khorasan Group also was targeted when the strikes in Syria began Tuesday morning. And the terror group al-Nusra Front says its leader, Abu Yousef al-Turki -- also known as ""The Turk"" -- was killed. But the United States has not said whether al-Turki is dead. ""We cannot confirm any particular leadership that might have been killed in any of these strikes,"" Kirby said Wednesday. And as far as how many ISIS militants have been killed, ""we don't know that, either,"" Kirby said. What's the difference between ISIS, al-Nusra Front and the Khorasan Group? International support . While the support for the U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria has been tepid, the support for the the international coalition against ISIS in Iraq is growing. The Dutch foreign ministry announced Wednesday that its military will contribute six F-16 fighter jets and 250 troops to carry out airstrikes and train Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said his country's parliament will weigh a request for six of its fighter jets to take part in the bombing campaign. Similarly, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he's recalling Parliament Friday ""to secure approval for the United Kingdom to participate in the Iraq air campaign. ""The U.N. Security Council has now received a clear request from the Iraqi government to support it in its military action against ISIL,"" Cameron said from U.N. headquarters in New York. ""... So it is right that Britain should move to a new phase of action.""","Airstrikes focus on oil refineries, a source of revenue for ISIS .

"She's an activist and a survivor known by her first name only.  Malala has inspired people around the world to stand with her for girls' education.  Now, Malala Yousafzai is launching her own nonprofit organization, a year after being shot by the Taliban while heading to school in Pakistan. The Malala Fund is officially described as being focused on helping girls go to school and raise their voices for the right to education.  The organization's mission seems to be based on a statement from Malala: ""They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed. And out of that silence came thousands of voices."" ""Malala is a symbol, a catalyst to get people excited about making an impact,""  says Shiza Shahid, 24, CEO of the Malala Fund. ""People have wanted to help and to give and now the fund can drive this energy."" Shahid says The Malala Fund will try to battle the things standing between many girls and education, including culture, violence, poverty and a lack of quality schools. She says Malala wanted to build an organization to empower girls to survive and thrive, because, says Shahid,  ""There is still so much to do."" Shahid met Malala several years ago and even helped organize a summer camp for Malala and other girls in Islamabad in 2009.   Born in Pakistan,  Shahid's family made education its priority.  Shahid won a scholarship to Stanford University then went to work in the private sector before turning to nonprofit work with The Malala Fund. ""Malala has an incredible voice,""  says Shahid.  ""We wanted to enable her to raise her voice when she wanted to, but still be able to be a 16-year-old girl and focus on her studies."" Malala is now in the 10th grade and although she has not decided where she will attend university, Shahid says Oxford and Harvard may be among the schools in the running.  While attending school, Malala seems ready to continue to inspire other girls through The Malala Fund  and a growing social media movement. CONNECT . Malala wants to give girls power and she loves to connect with girls on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. She has held Google hangouts, Google and Facebook chats. A big focus of The Malala Fund is to continue to facilitate a  social connection between Malala and girls around the world. INSPIRE . Many celebrities go by one name only, but Miley and Madonna don't quite hold the power of Malala. There have been hundreds of millions of tweets over the past year containing the name Malala.  People are now being encouraged to tell their Malala story by submitting a photo or video. Some samples of how people are telling their Malala story at #IamMalala . ""#IAmMalala because she is brave, and empowered. I hope all young women can follow in her footsteps!"" ""#IamMalala because she inspires me. We need more Malalas in the world because every girl has the right to go to school."" Actress Selena Gomez tweeted  ""#IamMalala I stand with Malala because there should be more young women like her. She is MY role model."" GIVE . In addition to raising awareness, The Malala Fund  will be raising money.  The goal is not to use the money to set up big regional offices and efforts but to empower global communities from the inside. Shahid says the fund will be looking  for what she calls  ""innovative solutions"" in developing countries and will support those programs.  The fund wants to amplify the voice of already established and proven organizations helping to fight the good fight for girls education. Malala has already used some money in her hometown in Pakistan's Swat Valley.  The money was used as a stipend to help poor families send girls to school instead of to work.  Domestic child labor keeps many girls around the world out of school. The Malala Fund  calls it a moral imperative to give the innocent some sort of power and  let people know what it means to be an educated girl.

"The rates of U.S. children affected by attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are skyrocketing, according to a recent report, but experts caution that the latest numbers require a bit of decoding. That information shows that 11% of children aged 4 to 17 were diagnosed with ADHD, a 16% increase since 2007, the last time that researchers at Centers for Disease Control (CDC) did a comprehensive survey for the prevalence of the neurobehavior disorder. The rise was especially dramatic among boys, with an estimated 1 in 5 boys in high school diagnosed with ADHD. What's more, about two-thirds of the children diagnosed were treated with stimulant medications that can improve attention but also come with side effects. Are rates truly climbing at such an alarming rate? Possibly. But many experts believe that's unlikely. The data was collected by the CDC and analyzed and reported by the New York Times; the CDC plans to publish its own report on the data in the coming months. TIME.com: Are ADHD medications being overused? To start, the information on ADHD rates came from parents reporting on the diagnosis for their children during telephone interviews. Such reports are useful but not as reliable as the verified diagnoses from medical or school records, says Dr. William Barbaresi, director of the developmental medicine center at Boston Children's Hospital. Second, such records-based data suggests that ADHD rates among children may be somewhere between 7.5% and 9.5%, with boys at the higher end of the range, not 11%. In its previous round of analysis, CDC found that ADHD diagnoses rose by 22% between 2003 and 2007, based on the same telephone surveys of 76,000 families in the United States, climbing by an average of 3% to 6% each year between 2000 and 2010. But the latest figures, which included responses collected between 2011 and 2012, show a far higher prevalence that hints at classrooms full of hyperactive and impulsive kids. ""By definition, ADHD requires that symptoms have to have a significant effect on life,"" says Barbaresi. ""To say that a tenth of all children have a biologic condition that affects their life enough to call it a disorder just does not make sense."" TIME.com: Teens taking ADHD drugs to get good grades . If that's the case, then a significant proportion of these children may also be mistreated with medications that they don't need. ""This report and others raises questions about whether we may not be overdiagnosing ADHD and overusing medications,"" says Dr. Thomas Power, director of the center for management of ADHD at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. That could have serious implications for children's long term mental and physical health, since ADHD drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall have been linked to dramatic weight loss and suppressed growth. And some experts have voiced concern that early use of the behavior-modifying drugs could alter the natural arc of children's social and creative development. TIME.com: New ADHD guidelines include kids as young as 4 . The apparent rise in the prevalence of ADHD highlights several shortcomings in the way that not only ADHD, but mental health issues in general, are diagnosed and treated in the United States, says Barbaresi. Most children are labeled with the disorder by their pediatrician or family doctor, who aren't always trained in providing the in-depth evaluation that a reliable diagnosis requires. ""Symptoms are not and should not be sufficient,"" says Ruth Hughes, CEO of Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). ""The symptoms have to occur every day for a long period of time, and, more importantly, these symptoms have to lead to major disruption or impairment in at least two areas of a person's life, such as at school or in relationships."" While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently provided an updated guideline on the criteria for a proper ADHD diagnosis, including reports not only from parents but from teachers and other daycare personnel about a child's hyperactive, impulsive and inattentive behavior, not all physicians have the time to carefully collect and vet the input from these sources. TIME.com: Teens' use of ADHD drugs up sharply . In addition, in order to properly identify a child affected by ADHD, Barbaresi, for example, conducts a medical and psychological assessment that takes several hours and requires the child and the parents to complete questionnaires about how the child responds to different situations, which factors seem to trigger hyperactive behavior or inattentiveness, as well as how disruptive these episodes are to the child's daily activities. Unfortunately, most insurers do not reimburse for such evaluations, and that pushes already busy doctors to take the path of least resistance -- prescribing medications such as Ritalin or Adderall. ""That's the big elephant in the room -- pediatricians and the family practitioner are being asked to sort out a complex situation in an inadequate amount of time without access to data from psychological assessments they need to make these fine distinctions,"" says Barbaresi. ""So it's a set-up for inappropriate decisions to be made."" And those include not just mis-diagnosis and over-medication of children but mistreatment and even under-diagnosis in some situations. In rural and urban areas, where mental health services are scarcer and more stigmatized, rates of ADHD diagnoses are slightly lower than in affluent areas, and children in these areas are less likely to be treated properly. That could have implications for the long-term health of these children, since studies also show that about 60% of children with ADHD have a learning disability, and that 60% will go on to develop another mental illness by age 19. So a proper diagnosis of ADHD doesn't just provide opportunities to treat behavior problems, but potentially mental illnesses as well. That's why ""it's clearly inappropriate to do these superficial assessments,"" says Barbaresi. TIME.com: Nearly 1 in 4 who seek treatment don't have ADHD . Being too quick to diagnose the disorder also means doctors may be bypassing effective, non-drug treatments that may benefit many children, especially the youngest. The AAP recommends that children younger than 6 start with behavior therapy before beginning medications, but writing a prescription is far easier than monitoring a series of sessions that involve training and a commitment of time and effort from parents and family members. ""The problem we face is that behavioral, psychosocial and non-pharmacologic interventions are not sufficiently available to people,"" says Power. ""When I talk to pediatricians and primary care physicians, they tell me they don't want to be diagnosing ADHD as often as they are, and they don't want to be using medications as often as they are, but they don't have many other options available. It's difficult to get kids into mental health treatments and psychosocial treatments that they believe many of these children and their families need."" These programs are designed to assess what factors trigger and sustain inappropriately impulsive and hyperactive behavior, he says, by involving parents and helping them to modify environmental factors or interactions with their children to modify their behavior. Playing and engaging more directly with children on a regular basis, for example, tends to calm them down, and setting limits and educating children about the consequences of their actions can also help. In groups that Power has conducted with his patients, parents have reported that such behavioral interventions are effective in improving children's relationships with their parents as well as with their teachers and classmates in school. But these programs don't work in a vacuum, and ideally, parents, doctors and teachers should coordinate their efforts to ensure that the appropriate behavior is being positively reinforced among children with ADHD. ""The best treatment is a combination of parent training, behavioral intervention, school interventions, and medication where needed,"" says Hughes. All too often, current therapies aren't taking advantage of the full power of this recipe. This article was initially published on TIME.com.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to pardon jailed oligarch and Kremlin opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky, he said Thursday. Speaking to reporters after a news conference, Putin said Khodorkovsky had written a letter appealing for a pardon, citing humanitarian factors. The announcement came a day after Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law and as the nation's human rights issues are in the spotlight as the country prepares to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in February. The amnesty, to mark the anniversary of the adoption in 1993 of Russia's post-Communist constitution, will be applied to thousands of Russian prisoners, the state-run RIA Novosti reported. ""We have several dozens of amnesties recently,"" Putin told reporters. As for Khodorkovsky, Putin said that he has been imprisoned for more than 10 years, which he called a ""serious punishment."" ""His mother is ill, and I think, taking into consideration all these circumstances, one can take an appropriate decision,"" Putin said. ""And a decree will be signed shortly after pardoning him."" Khodorkovsky's son told CNN Thursday that he was not able to substantiate Kremlin assertions that there is a planned pardon for his father. During a telephone interview,  Pavel Khodorkovsky said he had yet to talk to his father or his father's attorneys. ""With Putin things are always personal,"" he said. ""I would be surprised if Putin were playing politics."" His father, an oil magnate who backed an opposition party, has been in prison since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud. Russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, with countries including the United States accusing it of selective prosecution and abuse of the legal system. He has said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s.","Putin tells reporters about plans for a pardon .

"(CNN) -- A stationary front continued for a third day Friday to pound Brazil's southeast coast with rain, turning Rio de Janeiro's picturesque hills into nightmarish scenes and raising the death toll to 45, state officials said. A giant piece of a mountain collapsed Friday into mud, which descended onto the Sankay Inn resort in Angra dos Reis, two hours west of Rio, killing 22 people and injuring dozens of others, state officials said. Rescuers found another 15 bodies floating on the nearby island of Ilha Grande, officials said. The mudslides struck the inn at 4:30 a.m. in the haven for wealthy vacationers and celebrities. At least 40 people had been staying there, CNN affiliate Record TV reported. Rio de Janeiro's State Governor Sergio Cabral declared three days of mourning and ordered the state's civil defense rescue teams on duty round the clock. In the poorer suburbs of Rio de Janeiro's Zona Norte, several makeshift homes built on steep slopes fell victim to mudslides, leaving at least 350 people homeless, the officials said. The inundations began Wednesday. In nearby Jacarepagua, rescuers carried three bodies of a four-person family from the wreckage of their hilltop home after it was hit by a mudslide. Record TV broadcast the rescuers' attempt to find the family's toddler, Mariana. After sifting through rubble, the rescuers heard her cries emanating from underneath the rubble, dug her out and carried her to safety amid cheers. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters he will send marine and naval forces to aid in carrying out rescues in remote coastal areas where more bodies are believed to be trapped.","Death toll in Brazil flooding rises to 45, state officials said Friday .

"Furloughed workers, reduced combat readiness, shrunken naval operations and cuts to Air Force flying hours and weapons maintenance. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta listed those consequences as he provided a stark warning on Wednesday about the effects of impending budget cuts on the military unless Congress acts to avert them. The result, he said, would be ""the most serious readiness crisis"" faced by the armed services in over a decade. Panetta's address at Georgetown University, which he called ""hopefully one of my last speeches as secretary of defense,"" included the first details of how the Pentagon would deal with the automatic spending cuts -- or sequestration in congressional jargon -- set to trigger March 1 across federal agencies. For the Pentagon, sequestration would mean almost $500 billion in cuts over 10 years. For 2013 alone, some $46 billion in reduced spending would result in ""a serious disruption in defense programs and a sharp decline in our military readiness,"" Panetta said. Opinion: How to avoid job-killing budget cuts . ""There are no good options"" to deal with the situation, he continued, saying 46,000 department jobs would be at risk and more damaging measures in coming months could include: . -- Furloughing as many as 800,000 civilian workers for up to 22 days; . -- Cutting back on Army training and maintenance, which would reduce readiness of combat brigades outside Afghanistan; . -- Shrinking naval operations; and, . -- Reducing Air Force flying hours and weapons systems maintenance. ""This is not a game. This is reality,"" Panetta said, his voice rising. ""These steps would seriously damage a fragile American economy and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe."" His comments sought to increase pressure on Republicans and Democrats to reach agreement on deficit-reduction steps, thereby avoiding the across-the-board spending cuts of sequestration that were part of a 2011 deal that raised the federal debt ceiling. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama called for a short-term deal to put off the cuts so Congress could continue work on a permanent fix that provides desired reductions in the federal deficit. Obama made clear that he still wants a broader deficit-reduction agreement with Republicans that includes spending cuts, some entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks. However, Obama said, with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown, Congress should pass a temporary fix that would allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan. By the numbers: Recent defense spending . ""Compromise is a way to achieve it,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday, noting that Obama continued to offer proposals to cut spending and increase revenue that shifted to the middle from his original stances. However, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused Obama and Democrats of avoiding needed spending cuts and trying to put off tough decisions instead of facing their responsibilities as elected leaders. Deficit reduction should focus on cutting government spending and must include savings from popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Boehner insisted on Wednesday. ""At some point, Washington has to deal with its spending problem,"" he told reporters. ""I've watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years. I've had enough of it. It's time to act."" Boehner also echoed Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in opposing Obama's call for including more tax revenue in the mix. Opinion: Republicans, be smart about defense cuts . Also Wednesday, GOP legislators proposed $85 billion in reduced spending through attrition -- or not filling all vacated government jobs -- and freezing congressional pay as an alternative to the sequestration this year. They said the plan achieves the same amount of deficit reduction without more tax revenue sought by Obama and Democrats. The debate continues the ideological showdown between Republicans and Democrats over the size and role of government. Republicans driven by their conservative base want to reduce government and taxes to fund it, arguing that is the best way to grow the economy. Democrats promote a strong government safety net through entitlements and support programs that they say bolsters middle-class opportunity necessary for economic growth. Congress and the White House agreed to the sequestration cuts as part of the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government's borrowing limit to meet its obligations. The automatic spending cuts never were intended to become law, but instead were designed to be so unwieldy and overbearing that Congress would reach a broader deficit reduction deal to avoid them. Military pay in play in game of political poker . Deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012, an election year. Initially the cuts were to go into effect on January 2, but the government delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013. In his speech, Panetta referred to what he described as ""partisan dysfunction in Congress"" that he said threatens the quality of life and national security of the nation. Instead of making tough decisions to resolve problems, political leaders from both parties let issues become crises that require immediate but insufficient responses, he said. ""It's the easy way out,"" Panetta said, adding that there is a price to be paid for such an approach. ""You lose the trust of the American people,"" he said. ""You create an aura of constant uncertainty that pervades every issue and gradually undermines the very credibility of the nation."" CNN Explains: Sequestration . In another effort to stoke public alarm over the pending cuts, Carney told reporters that top defense contractors met at the White House with senior administration officials to discuss the impacts on their industry. According to Carney, those impacts would be overwhelmingly negative. ""It's not just a parlor game here in Washington,"" he said of the issue. ""These are real-world decisions that significantly affect the economy and the American people."" Obama said Tuesday that he still supports a broader deficit deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by Republicans -- such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government -- should be part of it. Boehner,  however, reiterated the GOP call for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and reforms -- a reference to changes in entitlement programs. A last-second agreement in the previous Congress that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit-reduction package. That measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving Obama and Congress in which other steps to increase government revenue, such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations, were considered but not included in the final deal. How our tribes cause gridlock in Congress . Obama and Democrats now want such revenue-raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts. McConnell expressed his opposition to such a move Tuesday, saying, ""The American people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law.""","GOP legislators propose alternate spending cuts to sequestration .

"Just 90 miles away, Cuba inevitably shares a long history with the United States, from conquistadors to the Spanish-American War to the Cold War. Here are some of the top moments in that history, even before the countries came into being. Old World meets New World . Christopher Columbus lands on Cuba in 1492 and claims the island for Spain, leading the way for that country's conquistadors to explore the Caribbean and the part of the U.S. Southeast that's now Florida, among other parts of the Americas. Spanish-American War . The United States helps Cuba win independence from Spain in a war between the European country and the Americans in 1898. In one of the more famous moments, Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders charge up Cuba's Kettle Hill during the Battle of Santiago, and the so-called 1st Volunteer Cavalry become instant heroes. The United States is given temporary control of Cuba under the Treaty of Paris, and Roosevelt later becomes U.S. President. Guantanamo Bay . The U.S. occupation of Cuba lasts until 1902, during which U.S. forces modernize the capital's infrastructure. By 1903, the new Republic of Cuba allows for the creation of a U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay in 1903, whose military moniker becomes ""Gitmo."" Cuban Revolution . In 1959, Fidel Castro, his brother Raul and their band of bearded guerrillas stage a successful communist revolution overthrowing President Fulgencio Batista, a U.S. ally. Fidel Castro goes on to become one of the world's longest-ruling leaders, for more than 50 years, and one of the most vocal critics of capitalism and U.S. policies. U.S. embargo . After the Cuban Revolution leads to the nationalization of about $1 billion of U.S.-owned property on the island, the U.S. government imposes a trade embargo on Cuba in 1960 that's designed to destabilize the communist regime. The Castros refer to this sanction as a ""blockade"" that they claim causes many of Cuba's problems. Bay of Pigs and missile crisis . The United States and Cuba come to the brink of nuclear war following a series of events that begins when U.S.-backed Cuban exiles invade the island at the Bay of Pigs. But the exiles suffer a crushing defeat in 1961, embarrassing the U.S. government. The following year, Cuba allows the Soviet Union to build missile installations on the isle, a major crisis in the Cold War. The standoff ends when the Soviet Union withdraws the missiles and the Americans promise not to invade Cuba.  Secretly, Washington also agrees to remove U.S. ballistic missiles deployed in Turkey against the Soviets. Mariel exodus . Flotillas of rafts and boats carry a mass movement of refugees from Cuba to Florida in 1980. In all, about 124,000 Cuban migrants take to the water and enter the United States. Fidel Castro enabled the exodus by allowing his people to leave Cuba freely from the port of Mariel. Elian Gonzalez . Only 5, Elian Gonzalez is the only boat survivor of a group of refugees fleeing Cuba to Florida in 1999. An international incident erupts during a custody battle between the boy's father in Cuba and his relatives in the United States. At gunpoint, U.S. agents remove the boy from his great-uncle's home, and Elian is returned to Cuba in 2000. Gitmo Part II . After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, President George W. Bush uses the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as a detention facility for terror suspects. At its height, the facility hold more than 750 detainees and becomes a flashpoint of controversy about its legality as a prison and about alleged mistreatment of detainees. Under an agreement, the U.S. government sends Cuba about $4,085 a year to lease the land. Fidel Castro, however, is said to have called the U.S. base in Guantanamo ""a dagger plunged into the Cuban soil,"" and the last time Cuba took the U.S. payments was in 1959, when the Castros took power.","The United States helped Cuba win independence from Spain in 1898 .

"(CNN) -- Retired pro wrestler ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, 58, was killed Friday morning in Seminole, Florida, when the Jeep he was driving jumped a median and hit a tree, the Florida Highway Patrol said. His wife, Barbara L. Poffo, 56, who was in the passenger seat, was injured, the patrol said. She was expected to be released from a hospital, said Highway Patrol Sgt. 1st Class Steve Gaskins. Savage's real name was Randall Mario Poffo, according to the wrestling federation for which he performed. The couple lived in Seminole, authorities said. An investigation is under way, but a Highway Patrol report said that Randall Poffo ""lost control"" of his 2009 Jeep Wrangler for ""unknown reasons"" as it was traveling westbound on Florida State Route 694 near 113th Street North in Pinellas County. A Highway Patrol report said Poffo ""may have suffered a medical event; however, this cannot be confirmed until an autopsy is performed."" His vehicle ""traveled over the raised concrete median divider, crossed the eastbound lanes of SR-694, over the outside curb and collided head-on with a tree,"" the report said. Poffo died in Largo Medical Center in Largo, Florida, the Highway Patrol report said. As a pro wrestler, he was known for his catchphrases ""Ooooooh Yeaahhhhh!"" and ""Can you dig it?"" After he retired from wrestling, he became known for his Slim Jim commercials. The wrestling federation and the maker of Slim Jim meat sticks expressed sympathies. ""WWE is saddened to learn of the passing of one of the greatest superstars of his time, Randy Poffo, aka Randy 'Macho Man' Savage,"" the wrestling federation said in a statement. ""Poffo was under contract with WWE from 1985 to 1993 and held both the WWE and Intercontinental championships. Our sincerest condolences go out to his family and friends. We wish a speedy recovery to his wife, Lynn. Poffo will be greatly missed by WWE and his fans."" ""We're saddened by the loss,"" ConAgra Foods, which makes Slim Jims, said in a statement.

"It took only moments to feel the impact of what was happening here. We had just landed in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. In the fields right outside the airport, a young woman was in tears. She started to wail and shout in Susu, one of the 40 languages spoken in this tiny country of 12 million people. The gathered crowd became silent and listened intently. The young man sitting next to me quietly translated, although I already had my suspicions. He told me the woman's husband had died of Ebola, and then quickly ushered us away. It is probably not surprising the airplane bringing us into Conakry was nearly empty, as are all the hotels here. Not many people in the United States have ever visited Guinea, or could even identify where it sits in West Africa. It is already one of the world's poorest countries, and the panic around Ebola is only making that worse. Some of it is justified. That's because this time, the outbreak is different. In the past, Ebola rarely made it out of the remote forested areas of Africa. Key to that is a grim version of good news/bad news: because Ebola tends to incapacitate its victims and kill them quickly, they rarely have a chance to travel and spread the disease beyond their small villages. Now, however, Ebola is in Conakry, the capital city, with 2 million residents. Equally concerning: it's just a short distance from where we touched down, at an international airport. It has gone ""viral,"" and now the hope is that it doesn't go global. Ebola: What you need to know . When I asked doctors on the ground about that scenario, they had split opinions. Several told me the concern is real but unlikely. Most patients with Ebola come from small villages in the forest and are unlikely to be flying on international trips, they told me. Furthermore, they don't think Ebola would spread widely in a western country; our medical expertise and our culture -- not touching the dead -- would prevent it. Others aren't so sure. No one wants to test that theory. WHO: Ebola outbreak one of 'most challenging' With Ebola, there is an incubation period of two to 21 days. Remember these numbers. This is the range of time it takes to develop symptoms after someone has been exposed. With an international airport close by, that means you could be on the other side of the world before you develop the headache, fever, fatigue and joint pain which make up the early symptoms of an Ebola infection. The diarrhea, rash and bleeding come later. Hiccups is a particularly grave sign with Ebola. It means your diaphragm, which allows you to breathe, is starting to get irritated. There is a lot we know about Ebola, and it scares us almost as much as what we don't know. We do know Ebola, a simple virus with a small genome, is a swift, effective and bloody killer. The mortality rate is higher than 50% and in some outbreaks reaches 90%. Ebola appears to kill in a clever way. Early on, it strategically disarms your immune system, allowing the virus to replicate unchecked until it invades organs all over your body. It convinces your blood to clot in overdrive, but only inside your blood vessels. While those blood vessels choke up, the rest of your body starts to ooze because the clotting mechanisms are all busy. You start to hemorrhage on the outside of your body.  Nose bleeds, bruising, even a simple needle stick will refuse to clot. But, it is the bleeding you don't see -- the bleeding on the inside -- that causes even more catastrophic problems. Many patients die of shock, within an average of 10 days. What is ebola? It sounds like the stuff of horror movies. But despite the real danger, Ebola is not at all easy to ""catch."" If it were, my wife would have refused to let me come in the midst of an outbreak. To become infected, you generally need to spend extended time with someone who is gravely ill, and come into contact with his or her infected body fluids. That's why family members and health care workers are the most likely to get sick. Over the last three weeks, at least 112 people have died, including 14 health care workers. With some infections, you can shed and spread the virus long before you get ill. That's not the case with Ebola. It's only after you are sick and feverish do you become contagious. However, it only takes a miniscule amount to infect and kill.  A microscopic droplet of blood or saliva on your bare hand could enter through a break in your skin. And, whether you realize it or not, we all have breaks in our skin. Since I was a kid, I have been fascinated with outbreaks. I learned in medical school that new pathogens generally make a jump from animals to humans, a process called zoonosis. This is happening in areas where human and animals come into continuous contact. David Quammen refers to it as ""Spillover,"" in his book of the same name. A stew of ducks, geese, chickens, pigs and humans in southeast Asia led to the spillover of avian flu, H5N1. Contact between pigs and humans in Mexico led to swine flu, H1N1; pigs and fruit bats were the recipe for Nipah fever in Malaysia. The best guess is that fruit bats may be a natural reservoir for the Ebola virus too, but this has not been confirmed. Quammen makes the point: Ebola didn't enter our world -- we entered its world. Pathogens can be predators, like lions, tigers and bears. A virus may not plan the way a big cat does, but in a sense it stalks its prey -- waiting for the moment of opportunity, then attacking with fury. Because it can lie silent for years, it's also easy to see Ebola as a killing ghost, like Jack the Ripper. Presumably outbreaks begin through some human-animal contact, but since that contact is ongoing we don't know what it is that leads Ebola to rear its ugly head. We don't know how to treat the illness or vaccinate against it. We certainly don't know how to cure it. I thought about all of this as I left that woman in the airport, and I have thought about her a great deal since then. Her grief made an impression on all of us. It also made this mysterious, exotic virus the world knows, but doesn't fully understand, so much more real and frightening. For the next 21 days (the outer range of the incubation period) the woman we saw will be monitored for a fever or any early signs she may have contracted Ebola from her husband. If she exhibits symptoms, she will be isolated and treated with fluids, oxygen and nutrition. That is all that can really be offered. Again, there is no cure for Ebola. For her neighbors, in Guinea and across its border, another critical number is 42 -- as in 42 days, or two incubation periods. If the health care teams here don't see any new cases during that time then they officially say the outbreak is over. We are not there yet, not even close. The clock is ticking.

"(CNN) -- Tracy McMillan has gotten under my single-status skin. I'm not sure how it took nearly a week for her Huffington Post column, ""Why You're Not Married,"" to land in front of me, but it finally did. And now I'm fired up -- not in an angry way but in the sort of way that made me skip to my desk, excited to type. To hear it from the thrice-divorced McMillan, I'm 41 and not married because of one (or more?) of six reasons: I'm a bitch, a slut, a liar, shallow, selfish or not good enough. Wow. Is that all? Maybe I smell, too. I'll be the first to admit I've got issues (c'mon, who doesn't?), but I'm not owning these. Perhaps she was talking about why her own marriages failed or was simply setting out to get a rise, which she did brilliantly. And while I've been guilty of occasional transgressions that might fit in some of those unflattering boxes, McMillan doesn't touch why I'm not married. Based on the buzz surrounding her conversation-starting piece, I'm laying down and lining up behind reason number seven: Life happens. Before reading on, know that I am not and refuse to be woe-is-me. Like Jennifer Aniston, minus the killer body and bank account, I'm happy. Really, I am. I skipped to my desk, dammit. Of course I'd love to meet and marry that one and only, but in the meantime I'm living my life, and I'm taking everything that's been given me on the journey. Maybe, like me, that's where you are, too. Maybe you spent your adolescence clashing with a stepfather who didn't get you emotionally. And maybe the father who did get you had been relegated by the courts, when you were 2 and your parents divorced, to every-other-weekend access. Maybe your first love cheated on you, just around the time a second divorce rolled through your family. So maybe your faith in men and marriage was a little shaken before you teased your hair for the prom. But that's nothing some therapy and better hair sense can't fix, right? Maybe you're a searcher with a healthy dose of wanderlust, someone who needed time to commit to furniture, let alone a man, because there was so much you needed to see, do and become. Maybe you were and still are a hopeful (I refuse to say hopeless) romantic who for years held a candle for the one you thought was The One. He'd changed your life, after all, when he lured you to Israel (though it could have been Thailand, for all you cared) -- allowing you to claim that Jewish side of yourself you'd never embraced before. And maybe he slipped and called you his soul mate at one point, a statement you caught and remembered. So even after you read the diary he'd left out, oops, learned about the Brazilian woman with amazing eyes, broke up and dated others, you still held out hope for him. You stupidly took the crumbs he tossed you from time to time and thought they had meaning. Finally, you got through your thick noggin that the guy just wasn't that into you. Hell, he wasn't even all that nice to you. You learned he wasn't the one who got away. He was the one who got in the way. Then, maybe you met the one who was that into you. He loved and respected you like no man had before. And the dog -- how could you not fall for the man and his dog? One day, while taking a break from kayaking, when you least expected it, maybe he pulled out a ring and asked you to marry him. Maybe you said yes but then freaked out. You couldn't eat dinner, and you love dinner. Maybe you snuck out of the B&B in the middle of the night. You found a pay phone and called your father, with whom you'd grown profoundly close, sobbing. Maybe you were seized by fear. But everyone around you, including your therapist, said they expected nothing less, given your family history. They even said it would be weird if you didn't freak out. So you were engaged to be married. But maybe after you moved to a new state and settled into engaged life, you still worried. That fear, that inkling that something was missing or wrong, grew stronger. Maybe you became a genius at dodging wedding questions. Maybe you lost countless hours of sleep, watching him and the dog as they slept peacefully, struggling with what you felt. You didn't want to quit the race, but at some point you knew with painful clarity there was a hurdle you two couldn't clear. So maybe, out of your love for him and yourself, you handed back the ring and left. Maybe you wished you could share custody of the dog. Maybe, even as you licked those wounds in your pathetic little apartment, you began to appreciate your courage. You learned to trust yourself more. You realized your past didn't define your future; you did. And then, maybe when you were finally prepared to date again, you woke up a single Jew living in Utah. But being a single Jew in Utah wouldn't matter, because then life tossed you a doozy that put the pain of a called-off engagement to shame. Maybe you suddenly lost your father. Being emotionally available for someone else wasn't something you could even entertain. Now you had an excuse not to date. But maybe you knew that your dad -- not to mention your amazing mom and stepmom, and your now-gentler ex-stepdad -- wanted nothing more than for you to love and be loved. So when you were ready, with a fresh start in a new city, you were excited to put yourself out there again. Maybe you were approaching 40 when you arrived in the South. Maybe you were slapped across the face with the reminder that most people your age are married with children. Maybe you went to a singles event and became convinced you were the oldest one there, so you ducked out early. But maybe you held onto hope and optimism. You sucked up your pride and whipped up an online dating profile. You found out that men in Belgium, as well as men with odd fetishes and offensively bad grammar and spelling, have a thing for you. You received horrifying -- yet hysterical -- notes from suitors that made for great Facebook status updates. Maybe you agreed to go on dates you dreaded because you were determined to have an open mind. Maybe you learned you had good reasons to dread those dates. You wolfed down a nice piece of salmon as one man told you, within the first hour of meeting, that he cheated on his wife, still loves his ex-girlfriend and didn't go to his own father's funeral. Maybe you thought you should charge him for therapy. But maybe you still believe there's someone great out there for you. You're ready, you know you have so much to give, and you look forward to meeting him -- wherever and whenever that might be. And in the meantime, you know you have a lot to be grateful for. Maybe you have a career you love, and through the stories of suffering you hear, you know that if still being single is your biggest problem, you are damn lucky. Sure, you might be a bitch, a slut, a liar, shallow, selfish or not good enough. Maybe, though, you happen to be 41 and single because life, real life with all its complications, has just worked out that way. So far. But, hey, what do I know? Maybe that's just me.","Tracy McMillan wrote on Huffington Post why she thinks you're not married .
