A mother of five has been fined and branded a nuisance by council officials after her terrible singing enraged neighbours. Carrie Taylor bought a karaoke machine to keep her children entertained, but also used the gadget with visiting family friends. Their non-stop singalongs to hits such as Angels by Robbie Williams, Abba's Dancing Queen and tunes from High School Musical sparked complaints from other local residents in Colne, Lancashire. An investigation by Pendle Council led to a noise abatement order telling Ms Taylor, 32, to turn down the volume, but after she allegedly ignored the edict five times officials took her to court. Fined: Mother-of-five Carrie Taylor has been prosecuted for singing out-of-tune karaoke too loudly . Gadget: Ms Taylor bought this karaoke machine to keep her children entertained and also used it herself . Now she been been fined £600 at Reedley Magistrates' Court, and will also have to pay £130 of court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Ms Taylor, a carer and part-time chef whose five children are aged between five and 14, said today: 'I feel like I can't even breathe in my own house without someone complaining that it is being too noisy. 'People should understand that I have five children, and I feel I really can't do anything without getting complained about. If we do play music it is never that loud, we can all hear each other talking. 'I bought the kids a karaoke machine for Christmas and a disco ball and we play the CDs through the 50in TV and sing along. It's fun. I don't think we have the music on full blast. 'On the karaoke machine we like to listen to High School Musical and Robbie Williams and all the pop music which is out. I get up and sing with them, I don't have the best voice but the kids are good. My daughter does cheerleading too, and so she practises here with her friends. 'It is my house and I should be able to relax in it - and we like listening to music.' Complaints: But Ms Taylor now says, 'I feel like I can't even breathe in my own house' Street: Officials in her home town of Colne, Lancashire issued a string of noise abatement orders . She added: 'I think it's a load of rubbish that people are saying we are making their lives a misery. I'm really cross about the whole thing. I'm normally in bed by about 9pm or 10pm. 'All I want to do at weekends is sleep, I have five kids so I don't even have time for a social life myself - let alone parties. 'I'm working hard and paying my rent and I can't do what I want in my own house. I can't believe it has come to this. My kids can't even play out now without my neighbour coming around complaining.' Ms Taylor was first served with an abatement notice by Pendle Council on November 14 but was recorded breaching it just a fortnight later on November 28. Further breaches were noted on December 18, January 15, February 3 and February 16. Home stereo: The family listens to music by playing it through their enormous 50in television . Idol: Ms Taylor's rendition of hits by stars such as Robbie Williams did not go down well with her neighbours . The court heard Taylor was witnessed by the Lancashire Night Time Noise Service failing to comply with the terms of her notice and the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Magistrates heard she repeatedly played music with a 'loud bass beat' that prevented her neighbours from sleeping. Complaints were also made regarding 'raised voices, swearing and general rowdy behaviour' from inside her terraced home. After the case one neighbour said: 'It's been going on for a long time and it makes me feel as though someone else is controlling my life. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping as well. 'In the summer they will be outside and I have my windows open and I can hear the pop music. I can hear them singing and it is not very good.' Councillor John David, Pendle Council's portfolio holder for environmental services, said: 'This particular resident has made her neighbours' lives an absolute misery. 'Nobody should have to put up with such antisocial behaviour.'","Carrie Taylor, 32, ignored council orders to turn down volume on karaoke .

Case: Nursery assistant Kyshia Cammock was sacked for smacking her own daughter at work and is suing for unfair dismissal . A nursery assistant is claiming unfair dismissal after she was sacked for smacking her own daughter at work. Kyshia Cammock, 25, lost her job at Little Folks Nursery in Birmingham after she hit her two-year-old on the bottom for misbehaving, a tribunal was told. The mother is suing her former employers, Mishi Nurseries Ltd, for unfair dismissal and seeking compensation. But Mishi Nurseries is fighting the claim and maintains Miss Cammock was sacked for gross misconduct after the incident, which is against company policy. The police were informed at the time, the hearing was told, but no action was taken. Miss Cammock was on a training scheme at the centre. She has accused her employers of favouritism among staff, claiming she had been treated less favourably than others. At the hearing, Miss Cammock said she had been told by management not to deny the smacking accusation because there had been CCTV footage. But it was revealed there was no such footage. Tribunal judge Victoria Dean said she could not find any reference in a witness statement by Miss Cammock that acknowledged she knew about the firm’s policy against smacking children on the premises. But Miss Cammock said during the hearing: 'I knew I was not allowed to smack a child.' Row: Owners of the Little Folks Nursery in Birmingham (pictured) maintain she knew the rules and that any smacking was a sackable offence . The nursery owners claimed the member of staff had been fully aware of the firm’s 'behaviour policy' regarding staff. The case was adjourned to a later date, to allow more evidence to be provided.

The report says that blood transfusions could be to blame for CJD remaining dormant in the British population . Up to 1,000 British people could die of the human form of mad cow disease because of infected blood given to them in British hospitals, ministers have been warned. The human variant of mad cow disease is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). It is caused by an abnormal protein called a prion. Prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells, causing a rapid deterioration of the brain and body. Most people who develop the disease die within one year. The new report published by the Government’s Health Protection Analytical  Team said that people could have contracted the disease through blood transfusions and they estimate that 30,000 Britons are likely to be carrying the condition in a dormant form. This is double the previous estimate. Scientists believe that the current total death toll of 176 could rise by more than five-fold as the infection has not been wiped out of the blood supply as it has been in the food chain. Frank Dobson, a former health secretary, has urged ministers to develop a nationwide screening programme for blood donors to stop future infections of vCJD, which has the potential to cause 'horrendous deaths', according to a report in The Telegraph. People are no longer in danger of getting vCJD from eating British beef, after ministers ordered the slaughter of millions of cows when the mad cow disease scandal broke in 1989. However, the Government acknowledges that one in 2,000 Britons – or approximately 30,000 people- are already carriers of the infectious proteins that cause some people to develop vCJD. A study last summer concluded the prevalence of this 'silent' vCJD is likely to be twice as high as previously thought. These 30,000 carriers can unknowingly pass on the infectious proteins to new sufferers through donated blood. Millions of cows were slaughtered after the CJD outbreak in 1989 . Because so little is known about vCJD, no one knows which carriers will go on to develop the disease or whether any new cases will actually occur at all. There have been no new cases for two years and there are thought to be no surviving sufferers of vCJD. To combat the problem surrounding blood transfusions, the report suggests ministers could consider recruiting young blood donors born after 1996 once they become eligible, as they will not have eaten infected beef. Mr Dobson, the former Labour Health Secretary, said 'everything humanly possible should be done to develop a blood test.' 'There is no room at all for complacency,' he said. '[With a blood test], you would be able to screen every potential donor. 'If that screening showed the incidence was higher than thought then maybe you would do it for the whole population.' A spokesman for the Department of Health said the Government continues to encourage 'people of all ages to give blood', adding 'we have one of the safest blood supplies in the world'. 'Independent experts from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs have used this study during their considerations of measures to reduce the potential risk of transmission through blood transfusions,' she said. 'There is no evidence of any UK clinical cases of vCJD being linked to a blood transfusion given after 1999.'","Experts believe new cases could be caused by infected blood transfusions .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:22 EST, 16 October 2011 . A first-born daughter of William and Kate will accede to the throne regardless of any male siblings under new plans which have been personally approved by the Queen. For centuries the monarchy's rules have favoured male heirs ahead of any older sisters. The current law of male primogeniture only allowed Elizabeth II to be Queen because she did not have any brothers. Women's lib: A firstborn daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would become Queen if planned changes to the laws of succession go ahead . Now the Queen has signalled that she supports calls made last week by David Cameron to change the system giving female heirs the same rights as their male siblings. Mr Cameron has described the system as 'an anomaly' but requires the consent of all 15 commonwealth countries in order to change the law. It would mean the Princess Royal leapfrogging over her younger brothers Princes Andrew and Edward to move from tenth to fourth in line to the throne. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is due to take place in Perth, Australia between the 28th and 30th of this month. It coincides with Queen's 11-day Australian tour which will begin on Wednesday. United: Both the Queen and the Prime Minister are said to be in favour of repealing the primogeniture law which puts male heirs ahead of their older sisters . A royal aide told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The Queen will naturally leave politics and the deabting to her government, but she has let it be known that she would very much welcome an active debate on the issue by all her commonwealth leaders.' Referring to the possibility of Kate becoming pregnant Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, warned that the 'clock is ticking'. In an interview following the announcement of their engagement, William said of their plans: 'Obviously we want a family so we’ll have to start thinking about that.' As the law stands, if William and Kate have a girl followed by a boy, their son will become king. But if they have daughters only, the eldest will become queen. A change would mean the Princess Royal leapfrogging over younger brothers Princes Andrew and Edward to become fourth in line . As well as the unanimous consent of . the 15 Commonwealth countries the reforms would require a repeal or . ammendment to the Coronation Oath act of 1688, the Bill of Rights 1688, . the Act of settlement 1701 and the Royal Marriagers Act 1772. The 1701 Act was brought in following . the Glorious Revolution – when a Dutch invasion helped overthrow a . Papist king – so that a Catholic could never sit on our throne again. The Prime Minister is also hoping to . repeal the ban on the monarch being married to a Roman Catholic however . the King or Queen, as Supreme Governor of the Church of England would . have to remain protestant. Mr Cameron wrote: 'This rule is a . historical anomaly, it des not, for example, bar those who marry spouses . of other faiths and we do not think it can copntinue to be justified.' Earlier this month the Sovereign Grant Bill, which will revolutionise the way the Royal Family is funded was passed by the House of Lords. It means that if William and Kate's firstborn is a girl she will become the first female to be allowed to inherit the £700million Duchy of Cornwall estate. Earlier this year Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who is in charge of constitutional change and is known to favour reform, stepped up contacts with other Commonwealth countries. He said: ‘My own personal view is that in this day and age the idea that only a man should ascend to the throne I think would strike most people as a little old-fashioned.' Franz, Duke of Bavaria, could have ended up on the British throne . Had an 18th Century law not been passed by Parliament, Britain's monarchy throughout the last 300 years would have had a very different cast of characters. For starters, rather than becoming one of the most recognisable faces in the world, our present Queen would have spent her life as a minor princess in some German backwater. And instead of pledging allegiance to Elizabeth II, loyal British subjects would now be singing God Save Our Gracious King to... Francis II of Bavaria. The 1701 Act Of Settlement passed the . crown to Electress Sophia of Hanover and her Protestant descendants - . and banned all Roman Catholics from ever ascending the throne. That . law - and the centuries-old practice of male primogeniture, in which a . male child automatically leapfrogs over his older sisters - has largely . dictated who became King or Queen of Britain for centuries. But . according to historian Ian Lloyd writing in the Sunday Times, Francis . II would now be ruling Brittania had these ancient laws not been . adopted. Franz, Duke of . Bavaria, is a distant cousin of the Queen and head of the House of . Wittelsbach, Bavaria's ruling family. He is the senior co-heir-general . of King Charles I and therefore regarded as the rightful heir to the . House of Stuart, which ruled England from 1567 to 1707. From . birth Franz was recognised by the Jacobites as a Prince of England, . Scotland, France and Ireland, Prince of Cornwall and Rothesay. The Duke's great-grandfather was the last king of Bavaria before being deposed at the end of World War One in 1918. During . World War Two, the Dukes' family condemned the Nazi regime and fled to . Hungary.  When Hitler's stormtroopers marched into Budapest in 1944, the . Royal Family was arrested and detained in a number of concentration . camps. Following . liberation in 1945, Franz, studied business management at the University . of Munich. Now 78, he still lives in an apartment in the city and is a . keen collector of modern art.","Future Kings or Queens would be decided simply by order of birth .

Every Friday and Saturday since 1933 at 5pm, he has ordered the same thing, a glass of Shropshire Gold. So when he turned 100 years old, there was only one way Britain’s 'oldest pub regular' was going to celebrate – a pint down the Golden Cross. For Queen and country: Norman Rushworth has been drinking at the Golden Cross, Shrewsbury, for the past 80 years. He celebrated his 100th birthday with a pint of his favourite ale - Shropshire Gold . Veteran: Norman Rushworth was in the RAF during the Second World War . But the twice widowed great-grandfather, who has sunk around 10,000 in his 80 years of drinking, shows no sign of slowing down. Mr Rushworth, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, said: ‘My secret to a long life is a pint of beer of course. 'I also like dancing and women. What else is there?’ Other regulars make sure his favourite spot by the bar is clear at the 600-year-old pub in the town centre. The RAF veteran drove an ambulance converted into a dental surgery for the troops in Europe after D-Day. After leaving the air force, he became a dental technician in Shrewsbury – a stone’s throw away from his favourite watering hole. He said: ‘My friends and I used to come in at lunchtimes and at weekends. ‘But we couldn't afford to come in every day. 'Four of us would come in, we used to sing songs and play games.’ Cheers: Mr Rushworth has sunk nearly 10,000 pints in his local pub, The Golden Cross, since he was 20 years old . Local: Norman even has his own spot at the bar . Landlord Gareth Reece, 49, said Mr Rushworth had become a part of the pub's heritage. ‘He comes for a coffee on Friday and on Saturday he has a beer or two,’ he said. ‘It is his secret to a long life - good beer, dancing and women. ‘Not many pubs have got customers who have been regulars since before the war. ‘Norman is part of the make-up of the place. 'He is such a regular, he sits there and his little crew of mates come and see him. ‘All his old apprentices at the dental practice come and see him. 'He is always cheerful and he is remarkable really. ‘He makes his own way here every week on his own. 'A pint of Shropshire Gold is his favourite tipple.’ Mr Rushworth has spent his whole life in Shrewsbury and married his first wife Elsie after leaving the RAF. The couple had one son, John, who now lives in France, before Elsie died in 1974 aged 47. Norman married his second wife Dorothy when he turned 80 in 1993 but she died shortly afterwards. He is a talented tenor singer and dancer and still makes frequent trips to Blackpool.","Every Friday and Saturday since 1933 at 5pm, Norman Rushworth has ordered the same thing - a glass of Shropshire Gold .

Early morning sunlight streams through the trees and caresses the ivy-clad cottage they surround. This sight is a timely reassurance that, while the days may be getting colder,  autumn’s spectacular show of colour can enchant our senses and warm our hearts. Cloaked in shades of red, gold and green, the Tu Hwnt i’r Bont tearooms in Conwy, North Wales, this weekend seemed to become part of its surrounding countryside, the structure only given away by the white of its windows. The 15th century cottage is transformed at this time of year by its coat, a massive Virginia creeper, changing from deep green to copper red. Beautiful scene: A spectacular autumn view as October approaches, with the low morning sun's golden rays highlighting the rainbow of colours starting to break through in the Conwy Valley in North Wales . Formerly a courthouse which served the . nearby market town of Llanrwst, the cottage, known locally as ‘the red . house’, was taken over in the 1930s by two elderly ladies who made money . by inviting locals around for evenings of musical entertainment. It is now owned by the National Trust . and leased by Tim Maddox, a former Londoner who escaped the city a . decade ago to run the tearooms and enjoy a slower pace of life with his . wife and three children.

Meanwhile, there is more wet weather to come as we enter October tomorrow. Ms Waite said: ‘It’s still quite unsettled and there is a band of rain moving south through the day (Sunday). It’s also very windy, and there are some gales around the coast and the hills. ‘On Monday there will be scattered showers, most persistent in the North-West and perhaps quite heavy at times. It’s still quite blustery and it’s still looking unsettled.’ Leafing summer behind: The first signs of autumn are evident in Pollok Park in Glasgow .

Last week, in a bid to find a living kidney donor and to raise awareness of organ donation, his mother Nicola uploaded a picture of Matthew to Facebook, appealing for a million people to 'like' the image. A screen grab of Australian youngster Jack Scobie, who sent a video to reassure UK kidney patient Matthew Pietrzyk, who is waiting for a transplant. Jack underwent the procedure last year . Matthew with the flag of his beloved Celtic football club. He was born with a rare genetic disorder which has damaged his kidneys . Now Matthew and his family have received a touching video message from a five-year-old named Jack Scoble, who lives on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, and underwent a kidney transplant himself last year. The video, which has already been watched by more than 1,000 times, was posted on the appeal's Facebook page by Jack's parents. In the video, Jack says: 'My mum and dad have told me that you were waiting to find your new kidney. I want to tell you to hang in there buddy.

'But keep your fight and your chin up, Matthew.' Solemn: Jack looked sad (left) when talking about how scary his own experience was but told Matthew that he is an example that there is always hope . The big-hearted youngster also encourages people thinking about liver donation to come forward. 'To everybody that's thinking to be a donor, don't be afraid to go mate, my donor wasn't and gave me a chance to live and grow up with mum and dad and brothers and sisters,' says Jack. 'I will never forget how brave my donor was and thank God and heaven for him everyday. 'Thinking of you Matthew and tell your mum and dad not to cry.' In a post under the video, Jack's dad, Darryl Scoble, said his family send their love and support, and added: 'Our family is here for your family.' Mrs Pietrzyk, 33, an aerobics teacher, said the message had helped give her family hope, she said: 'It just overwhelmed me and was so heartwarming,' she said.

'Jack might be only five, but he summed it all up perfectly, what it is like to have to go through what he went through, and what it is like for Matthew. 'Matthew really liked it and because Jack is littler than him he thought he was cute, and his message was very sweet."" Matthew's aunts, uncles, grandparents and family friends have been tested as potential donors, but while six share his blood group, none were a sufficient match. The youngster was born with congenital nephrotic syndrome which means his faulty kidneys get rid of protein through his urine . Matthew bravely smiling on a trip to the hospital (left) and on a trip to the beach (right) He had one kidney removed in October 2007 to prepare him to receive a donor organ from his mum. The transplant took place in January, 2008, at Nottingham City Hospital but the new kidney failed immediately and was removed. He had both his kidneys removed and, while he waits for a donor to be found, has to endure daily dialysis sessions. Matthew is on the national waiting list, alongside hundreds of other children. His family and friends have been tested as potential donors, but while six share his blood group, none were a suitable match. It was when Mrs Pietrzyk's youngest brother was found to not be a match that she launched her online campaign last month. Matthew in hospital with his brother Joe.

One man told the New York Post he was worried he might be fined after he couldn't get a second bike out during the first day of the service. ‘When I put my card in to get another bike, it gave me red,’ fumed Yong Zhu, 40. ‘I tried another rack, and it gave me red.

Stepping down: Evelynn Hammonds (pictured) has resigned from her role as dean at Harvard University . A top Harvard University dean has resigned from her post after facing backlash for authorizing email searches during a college cheating scandal. Evelynn Hammonds was widely criticized for authorizing two email accounts of a resident dean to be searched during an investigation of a leak to the media about the scandal. Hammonds was accused of breaking campus privacy rules and Harvard President Drew Faust said 'different choices should have been made' while handing the matter, The Boston Globe reported. In her defense, . Hammonds said at a faculty meeting that she undertook the email search . to protect the names of the students suspected of cheating last August. She wanted to find the leak to the media within the faculty so the students' names would not be made public. The top . administrator, who had been a dean at Harvard for five years, will . return to a teaching role at the university after stepping down from her . leadership role. She . will teach and research History of Science and African and African . American Studies department, and will take over a new study of race and . gender in science and medicine at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for . African and African American Research. When . the university announced her departure from her leadership post, which . will take affect on July 1 after a sabbatical, it praised her . achievements and leadership. Email probe: 16 deans had their emails searched at Harvard University, pictured, as officials hunted down the member of staff leaking information about a cheating scandal to the press . President . Fraust said in a statement: 'She has fully invested herself in . improving the experience of our undergraduates both inside and outside . the classroom, and in promoting a culture of inclusion and community . across the College. 'I'm . grateful to her for all she has done to help our undergraduates thrive . and we will be fortunate to continue benefiting from her talents and . wisdom.' Hammonds . said in her statement: 'Being dean of Harvard College has been an . immensely rewarding experience for me, but I miss engaging deeply with . my scholarship and teaching. 'I . am looking forward to redesigning my classes in light of new . technologies and modes of teaching and I'm eager to return to my . teaching ad research on race, genomics and gender in science and . medicine.' During the cheating scandal last fall, Harvard University administrators secretly searched the . emails of 16 deans, looking for a mole who leaked information about a cheating scandal that rocked the Ivy League college. Cheats: The Spring 2012 'Introduction to Congress' had an enrollment of 279 and nearly half those students faced some kind of investigation in the case . Deans . on the Administrative Board of the college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, . who were tasked with investigating the cheating claims, were all . secretly targeted. Last . year news leaked to the media that up to 125 students of politics had . been involved in widespread cheating at the respected school. They were discovered when a . teaching assistant detected issues with a take-home test on the subject . of Congress. It appeared . students had shared answers - something expressly forbidden on take home . tests at America's oldest higher education institution. In February, Harvard . said it had dealt with the issue by taking academic sanctions against 60 . students - some of whom were temporarily suspended. Administrative accounts of all the deans on the board were searched without any prior warning. IT . officials were told to only search subject headers and not read the . content of emails but the secretive process still came under fire among . academic staff at the school. Harvard spokesman . Jeff Neal said: 'Any assertion that Harvard routinely monitors emails - . for any reason - is patently false,' he said in an email. Michael . Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said the college . would always take ' necessary and appropriate action' if the Administrative . Board process was believed to be compromised. 'If circumstances were to arise that gave reason to . believe that the Administrative Board process might have been . compromised, then Harvard College would take all necessary and . appropriate actions under our procedures to safeguard the integrity of . that process, which is designed to protect the rights of our students to . privacy and due process.' Sharon . Howell, Harvard's senior resident dean, said they owed the deans an apology. Congressional oversight: The students were said to have conferred on answers to the take home test. Something expressly forbidden at the school . 'They don't seem to think they've done anything wrong,' she told the Globe. The cheating first came up last August. Students had . apparently conversed via email and through other channels about how to . answer questions on the exam in . violation of the school's no-collaboration policy. The class was widely considered an . easy one, however Harvard's rules state that unless specifically told . they can collaborate, no student may confer with another on take-home . exams. At the . time Smith said the case that attracted negative publicity to the . venerated research institution reflected on it as a whole. '[The . investigation] never was, as some have mistakenly assumed, to shine a . bright light on any student or other member of our community,' he wrote. 'Let me be crystal clear: we all can do better.' The Globe said in March that the dean who had leaked the information had been discovered in the email search but was not punished. It is believed they forwarded a memo on the cheating scandal to a student rather than directly to the media.","Cheating scandal hit the Ivy League college last August, involving around 125 students .

Claude Alexander Allen III, 20, was arrested last Friday by police after they found the body of Michael Phillip Harvey, 25, in the woods near the Allen family home in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The . student called 911 around midnight and told police that he killed an . intruder after he tried to break in.

Court . for a bond review, he admitted to having a disagreement with Harvey . over 'controlled dangerous substances sales,' reports the Washington . Post. A District Court judge has ordered that Allen be held without bond. Harvey's body was found around 75 yards behind the house but police believe an altercation occurred and the attack started in a two-car garage. Montgomery County Police Capt. Jim Daly told the Post it was not clear if the argument moved to the woods or if the man's . body was dragged there after he died. When . police arrived at the large white-brick home, Allen was waiting for . them but that his parents were not home at the time of the attack. They . found the hatchet in a garbage can. Crime scene: Investigators gather outside the Maryland property where a man was killed with a hatchet . Another man had been there, but left . by the time police arrived. They tracked him down and questioned him but . he is not a suspect, Daly told the Post. The witness said that he saw Allen emerge from the garage of the home with blood on his hands. Allen told his friend he 'got the person' who was robbing his home and asked for help moving the body out of the house. Fearing for his own safety, the . witness helped Allen move the body of his friend to a trash can and then . fled when Allen went to another area of the home. Two years ago, Mr. Allen was placed on probation after he pleaded guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia. A neighbor told the Post that Allen, a star soccer and rugby player, had just returned home from college in the state. Connections: George W.

It is not the family's first brush with the law; Claude Alexander Allen, now 52, was arrested in 2006 for allegedly claiming refunds for more than $5,000 worth of merchandise he did not buy. The thefts occurred at 25 stores from 2005 until 2006 even though his annual salary as an adviser was $160,000 . 'I was shocked and my first reaction was one of disappointment, deep disappointment - if it's true - that we were not fully informed,' Bush said at the time. Allen pleaded guilty to theft on August 4, 2006. He claimed that in the months leading up to the thefts, he had suffered huge stress and sleep deprivation. His wife cited Hurricane Katrina and his subsequent work as one of the causes of stress. Disgraced: Allen Sr., pictured left with his wife Jannese as he leaves court and right in his mugshot, stepped down from the role working for Bush in 2005 after he was caught shoplifting . Allen was ordered to reimburse Target . for the $850 of stolen merchandise. He also paid a $500 fine and agreed . to perform 40 hours of community service. A trained lawyer, he was a deputy secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services and nominated to a federal appeals court seat in 2003.

An 80-year-old professor claims he was told to clean his own toilet while he was crippled with pneumonia in hospital. Joseph Cummins, a professor of genetics, made a complaint to the hospital after his unpleasant and humiliating ordeal; but the centre has denied that it happened. The story has stunned a local politician who claims the incident happened because of cut backs in hospital staff. Investigation: The Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario is investigating why an 80-year-old patient had to clean his own toilet . Mr Cummins was admitted to hospital after being treated at the emergency department at London Health Sciences Centre, in Ontario. He was suffering from pneumonia following a recent trip to the UK. Staff at the emergency department gave Mr Cummins antibiotics and a strong laxative before taking him to a ward. But due to the medication, the Western University professor said he had an 'accident' as he reached the bathroom and needed help to clean the toilet. He went looking for hospital staff but could only find a man who delivered patients' breakfast that day. Appalled: Politician Andrea Harworth, leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), blamed government cuts for insufficient staffing levels at the time . Speaking to The Star, Mr Cummins said: 'He sort of wandered down the hall and then came back later and told me I had to learn to control my bowels . . . and then I did my best to clean it up.' He added: '...it was no easy matter because at that time I was crippled,' Unwell and distraught, Mr Cummins did his best to deal with the problem using paper towels. He went on to spend four more days in the hospital before being discharged to continue his recovery at home. A week later, once he was better, he reported his experience to the centre's patient complaints office, but was shocked by the hospital's response. The hospital denied that the incident had happened. Tony LaRocca, vice-president of community and stakeholder relations at the hospital, said in a written statement that, according to a subsequent investigation, the incident never happened. 'All we can say is that we have no record of any such incident ever occurring at our hospital, and simply put, we would never ask a patient to do their own cleaning.' The letter, quoted in The Star, says the hospital has highly trained environmental service workers ready to be dispatched to deal with required clean-ups in any part of the hospital. Appalled at the treatment, politician Andrea Harworth, leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), blamed government cuts for insufficient staffing levels at the time. She said it was an 'absolute disgrace' Mr Cummins had to clean his own toilet, which he shared with one other patient.

Two men who rushed to the aid of jogger Rob Nelson after the three dogs went for him in Sydney said he was 'screaming for mercy' as they dragged him into the road and began mauling at him 'like fierce animals ripping apart an animal.' Mr Nelson, 49, was today undergoing an operation in Liverpool Hospital, in Sydney's western suburbs, as paramedics said the injuries to his lower body were so severe his internal organs were visible. Struggle: A dog is removed from the home where the pitbulls had been kept as police look on . One of the animals is removed by a dog handler, who was careful to keep his distance . The jogger was mauled and chewed upon for about five minutes before two men drove the crazed animals, identified as two males and a female, off by striking them with a hammer and a pot plant. One of the rescuers, Chris Thompson, 40, said the scene was horrific. 'I was in the back yard working and I heard the bloke scream for mercy and I ran out at a 100 miles an hour and ran into the dogs and tried to put a kick into them. 'They were gnawing on his shoulder the way dogs do when they have a knuckle of a bone,' he told Australian media. The bites were so severe, he said, that not only the flesh but also the tendons and muscles were torn from Mr Nelson's arms. Mr Thompson's friend, Colin McEwen, 54, was badly bitten on the hand when he tried to help. 'I grabbed a pot plant and cracked it over the dogs' heads and the shock made them disperse, but then they came back and latched onto Colin's hand,' said Mr Thompson. Police arrive in numbers at the home where the dogs were kept . 'I got a hammer and smacked it straight in the snout and it did nothing. It was wagging its tail like it had done good. 'Colin was on the ground and it went for his head but I got it with a hammer just in time and just missed Colin's head by inches.' Paramedic John Brotherhead said Mr Nelson had suffered some of the worst injuries he had seen in 27 years as a paramedic. 'His upper body was so traumatised I had to insert an intravenous drip through his feet. 'His height has probably saved him. A child or younger person would have had no hope warding off those dogs. The attack would have been fatal.' A passing bus pulled up at the scene and some of the passengers got off to offer their help to the badly injured runner. When police arrived they were so concerned about their own safety that one of the dogs had to be tasered. The owner of the dogs, which have been caught by council rangers and are being held in a pen, has agreed that they should be put down. He is expected to face charges. Police detective superintendent Jim Johnson said today that 'if a child or young person had been attacked, I have no doubt whatever that that child would have suffered fatal injuries.","Two men drove off the American Staffordshire Terriers with a hammer .

Nationwide, Girl Scout councils are confronting intense opposition as they sell camps that date back to the 1950s and earlier. Leaders say the properties have become a financial drain at a time when girls are less interested in camp. Defenders insist the camping experience shaped who they are and must be preserved for future generations. 'Those camps still belong to us, not just literally as members of the organization, but as people who feel like, ""That's part of my home life,""' Jodi Kinsey, a Girl Scout troop leader based in Iowa, said. 'When camps get closed, it's devastating. I mean, heartbreaking. We adults can cry over it and do.' Pro-camp activists have boycotted cookie drives, held overnight camp-ins outside council offices, filed legal actions and tried to elect sympathetic volunteers to governing boards. Badge of honor: Former Girl Scouts like Jodi Kinsey (whose sash is pictured above), are fighting to keep camps open for the current generation of scouts . The other side has responded with its own aggressive tactics. At public meetings, some Girl Scout councils have hired facilitators to tightly manage the agenda and security guards to watch over protesters. Others have used parliamentary tactics to call protesters out of order. Both sides insist they want what's right for the girls, but compromise is hard to find. In Ohio, police were present to keep protesters off council property during a ceremony last year to mark the closing of Camp Crowell/Hilaka. Opponents have raised $80,000 to pursue a lawsuit, so far unsuccessful, seeking to keep it and others open. 'Democracy has been completely squelched,' said volunteer Lynn Richardson of Bedford, Ohio, who recalled how police were at their campouts on the council lawn and parliamentarians have called her out of order. 'They will hide behind rules and regulations, but they are shutting us down.' Saved for now: Camp Conestoga in New Liberty, Iowa, was one of the Girl Scout camps spared from closure . Because of camp: Camp Conestoga will continue to make memories for young Girl Scouts . Riding lessons: At Camp Conestoga, Girl Scouts have the opportunity to learn how to ride horses--an experience being threatened by the closure of camps across the country . Because of declining camp attendance and increasing maintenance costs, the Girl Scouts of Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois was losing hundreds of thousands of dollars subsidizing its camps. But the group backed down from its proposal in March, one day before its board was to vote on the closings. The board agreed to keep the camps open for now and to turn Camp Conestoga into a modern residential camp. But the council still plans to eventually sell unused parts of three other sites. Diane Nelson, CEO of the 20,000-member organization, said the decision to keep the camps came after an outpouring from volunteers who promised to promote and manage them at a lower cost. But she blasted 'a small group of individuals' for 'taking the negative approach.' Nelson acknowledged hiring facilitators to ensure that meetings weren't dominated by a few individuals and bringing in security guards as a safety precaution because of fears of rowdy protests, which didn't materialize. 'It's not that we were afraid of any of our volunteers. We didn't know who was going to come,' she said. The Girl Scouts, which began a century ago, established hundreds of camps nationwide as the organization expanded. But in recent decades, the group has consolidated its local councils. That process accelerated dramatically under a plan that cut them from 330 to 112 by 2009. The restructuring left groups with additional properties to manage, many featuring old cabins and dining halls that need upgrades. Gregory Copeland of Domokur Architects in Akron, Ohio, a consultant to local councils, said by 2020, the number of Girl Scout-owned camps could easily be cut in half. He said the newly merged groups have a glut of properties they cannot afford to maintain, let alone fill with programming. 'While it's a hugely emotional issue, there's just realistically no way they can end up sustaining that amount of land,' he said. 'The emotional ties have nothing to do with logic or dollars or anything else. People just don't want to lose what they feel is theirs.' Scouts from the younger generation are accustomed to technology and comfort and have more summer activities to choose from. Girl Scouts USA estimates that only 10 per cent typically attend a residential summer camp every year, while 25 per cent will spend a weekend camping with their troop. More...

The national group does not keep data on the proposals, but says a 'considerable number' of councils have opted to sell one or more sites, said Mark Allsup, a property consultant for the organization. He said some councils have handled sales smoothly by keeping members informed during reviews so that final decisions aren't a surprise and are backed up with data. Some decisions 'are being made soundly, and we are very supportive of them,' he said. 'And, like with anybody else, we have good students and C students.' Critics say any sales undermine a key Girl Scouts tradition. They have a saying: 'I am who I am today because of camp.' Troop Leader Kinsey, a University of Iowa art history professor, credits her experience with giving her a love of landscape painting and friendships that include an English woman who named a child after her. She said the Girl Scouts have become too focused on money, and she was outraged by the security presence at one meeting. Kinsey was stunned when she heard that her regional Girl Scout council made a proposal to sell its last four summer camps. For decades, the camps had been cherished places where thousands of young girls spent summer breaks hiking, huddling around campfires and building friendships. Kinsey, whose daughter learns to train horses at camp, immediately started a petition to fight the idea. Other scouting alums and volunteers have taken up the cause, too, packing public meetings, sending letters to newspapers and recording a protest song for YouTube. When those efforts failed, they filed a lawsuit. 'We just keep shaking our heads, ""This is just not Girl Scouts"",' Kinsey said at her Iowa City home, where she keeps her old Scout memorabilia. 'I've started saying there's been a corporate takeover of Girl Scouting and that Girl Scouts are losing their way.'

Girl Scouts Heart of New Jersey advertised the 31-acre property for sale in 2011 and recently lowered the asking price to $3.25 million. Last month, a judge ordered an Alabama council to turn over documents to critics fighting its plan to sell 88-year-old Camp Coleman. The council had initially demanded that the group pay $22,000 for staff time and copy charges, but the judge called that excessive. Opponents recently succeeded in electing 11 members to the 29-member council, and now hope to keep it open. Jim Franklin of Birmingham got involved after his 8-year-old granddaughter, who rides horses there, came to him in tears. 'Everybody, including me, started out saying this is just about our camp.

Conflicting work schedules and the hectic pace of modern life can mean husband and wife quickly become little more than ships that pass in the night. But for the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips and her husband Mike Tindall it seems absence really is making the heart grow fonder. Busy schedules: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall enjoy some rare time together as she competes at the Banbury Horse Trials last year . She is an Olympic horsewoman with a packed timetable on the three-day eventing circuit and he is a professional rugby player who captained the Barbarians in their defeat against England on the weekend. So with both busy training and competing around the world, they haven't been seeing much of one another lately. But when asked if being apart could actually be the secret of a successful marriage Ms Philips answered a resounding yes. 'Exactly', she laughed: 'And we get to . watch each other when we're off - although I suppose it's not very . helpful if we want to go away together.' Nuptials: The couple married at Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh in 2011 . From the start, the marriage between Ms Phillips, currently the 14th in line to the throne, and the burly 16st Mr Tindall,  was anything but a traditional Royal affair. They . met in 2003 when Mr Tindall was in Sydney for the Rugby World Cup. She . happened to drop into the bar where he was drinking with friends.

The couple share a tender moment during their Cyprus honeymoon . Their wedding, in July 2011, was held not at Westminster Abbey but at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh. She pledged to honour but not to obey and kept her maiden name. The reception, which was attended by the Queen, featured a vodka fountain and was said to involve some seriously hard-partying. Tindall himself was only spotted returning to the bridal suite, still wearing his morning suit, at 2pm the following day.

A disgraced former New York City Police Commissioner is set to be freed from federal prison today after serving three years for tax fraud. Bernard Kerik will host a banquet to celebrate his release and has ordered in some of his favourite foods for his return to his New Jersey home today. Kerik was the first New York City Police Commissioner to ever be imprisoned on federal crimes, and has served three years after he pleaded guilty in 2009 to lying to White House officials and tax evasion. Release: Former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik (right pictured at his trial in 2009) is expected to leave jail today after serving three years for tax fraud . His release is expected today at around 9am EST according to his friend Albert Manzo, who runs Brownstone catering in Paterson. Quoted in an NBC New York article, Manzo said: 'He put a request in for some food that he's been missing for a few years...He loves our short ribs, shrimp scampi - a lot of things he doesn't have access to there.' The caterer said Kerik had invited 20 guests to share his first meal at his Franklin Lakes home as a free man once again, having done time for his crimes. The former NYC police boss, who stood beside former Mayor Rudy Giuliani at the time of the September 11, 2001, attacks, was once considered a star in law enforcement and national security. But he saw his career begin to crumble when President George W. Bush nominated him in 2004 for U.S. Homeland Security secretary. Checks into his background led to disclosures about his failure to pay taxes for a nanny. This undermined his consideration for the job and he withdrew from consideration. Further investigation, however, led to the criminal charges. Former NYC Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, is now doing commercials after Kerik's tax fraud saga . In 2009, Kerik pleaded guilty to charges of tax evasion, lying on a bank loan application and lying to the federal government, including lying to White House officials about his association with anyone doing business with the city of New York. He faced up to 30 years in prison on the most serious charge if he hadn't have pleaded guilty. He was sentenced in February 2010. Kerik was good friends with NYC's former mayor Rudy Giuliani, but Kerik's fall from grace also clouded the professional fortunes of his friend. Giuliani, who had recommended Kerik - his former chauffeur and security guard - for the commissioner position, failed in his presidential bid in 2008.

An outspoken Japanese politician apologized Monday for saying U.S. troops should patronize adult entertainment businesses as a way to reduce sex crimes, but defended another inflammatory remark about Japan's use of sex slaves before and during World War II. Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, co-leader of an emerging nationalist party, said his remarks two weeks ago rose from a 'sense of crisis' about cases of sexual assaults by U.S. military personnel on Japanese civilians in Okinawa, where a large number of U.S. troops are based under a bilateral security treaty. Hashimoto also said he had not tried to condone a system of so-called comfort women, but meant to say military authorities at the time, not only in Japan but in many other countries, considered it necessary. Scroll down for video . Sorry I'm not sorry: Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto apologized to the U.S. military for saying soldiers should make use of brothels in Okinawa, while refusing to take back a comment on Japan's use of prostitutes in World War II . He denied any intention to avoid Japan's responsibility over its wartime actions, adding he wanted to shed light on sex offenses in the battlefield and encourage open debate on the problem today. 'I understand that my remark could be construed as an insult to the U.S. forces and to the American people' and was inappropriate, he told a news conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo. 'I retract this remark and express an apology.' Hashimoto, a lawyer and former TV personality, created an uproar with comments to journalists two weeks ago about Japan's modern and wartime sexual services, which he said were misquoted. The comments added to recent anger in neighboring countries that suffered from Japan's wartime aggression and have complained about a lack of atonement for the atrocities. Hashimoto said then that the practice of using women from across Asia to work in front-line brothels before and during World War II was necessary to maintain discipline and provide relaxation for soldiers. He added that on a recent visit to the southern island of Okinawa, he suggested to the U.S. commander there that his troops 'make better use' of the legal sex industry 'to control the sexual energy of those tough guys.' On Monday, Hashimoto called the use of comfort women an 'inexcusable act that violated the dignity and human rights of the women, in which large numbers of Korean and Japanese were included.' He did not mention women from other countries, such as China, the Philippines and Indonesia, where many teenagers were forced into sex slavery. Forgotten women: Hashimoto failed to mention the Chinese, Filipino, and Indonesian women also exploited as sex slaves during World War II. Above, Filipino former-comfort women march in 2004 to protest their wartime abuse . An 'inexcusable act': Historians estimate that the Japanese military forced up to 200,000 women to act as prostitutes during World War II . He said Japan must express deep remorse and apologize to the women. He repeatedly denied any intention to whitewash Japan's wartime responsibility. But he didn't apologize for those comments about Japan's wartime brothels, and insisted that the country's wartime government did not systematically force girls and women into prostitution. Historians say up to 200,000 women, mainly from the Korean Peninsula and China, were forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers in military brothels. While some other World War II armies had military brothels, Japan is the only country accused of such widespread, organized sexual slavery. 'If only Japan is blamed because of the widely held view that the state authority of Japan was intentionally involved in the abduction and trafficking of women, I will have to inform you that this view is incorrect,' he said. Hashimoto urged the government to clarify or revise Japan's landmark apology in a 1993 statement by then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono to clearly state that Japan did not systematically force women into prostitution for its wartime military. The Kono apology acknowledged the military's involvement, both direct and indirect, in the forced recruitment of the women. Hashimoto said the apology does not say whether the operation was run under 'state will' and that such murkiness has contributed to longstanding disputes between Japan and South Korea over the issue. He raised doubts of accounts by some of the women who have come forward as victims of Japan's sexual slavery as reliable evidence of coercion. Before taking office in December, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe advocated revising the Kono apology, but now says he stands by it. Hashimoto said he was quoted out of context in saying he believed that the use the system was necessary. He said he was trying to say that armed forces around the world 'seem to have needed women' in past wars and had violated women's human rights during wartime. Singling out Japan was wrong, as this issue also existed in the armed forces of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and the former Soviet Union during World War II, he alleged, without elaborating. 'Based on the premise that Japan must remorsefully face its past offenses and must never justify the offenses, I intended to argue that other nations in the world must not attempt to conclude the matter by blaming only Japan and by associating Japan alone with the simple phrase of ""sex slaves"" or ""sex slavery,""' Hashimoto said in a statement to journalists. Hashimoto's suggestion to the U.S. troops brought sharp criticism from Washington. The State Department called Hashimoto's comments 'outrageous and offensive.' Okinawa was invaded by U.S. forces in World War II and has had an American military presence since. The 1995 rape of a schoolgirl by two Marines and a sailor spread rage across the island, and more rapes and other crimes linked to U.S. servicemen over the years, along with military land use and aircraft noise, have caused longstanding anti-U.S. military sentiment there. Sense of crisis: Hashimoto made the comments because of a 'sense of crisis' over sex crimes committed by U.S. soldiers stationed in Okinawa, where there has been a U.S. military presence ever since World War II . Hashimoto, 43, has become well known in recent years for his outspokenness. Last year, he formed the Japan Restoration Party with former Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara, a strident nationalist. It is now an opposition party in parliament.","Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto took back his comment that U.S. soldiers stationed in Okinawa should use brothels in order to reduce sex crimes .

But a 20-year-old hoping to become the youngest person to fly around the world solo overlooked one small, but very significant, item - his passport. Jack Wiegand, from Fresno, California, began his flight last Thursday when he flew from his hometown to Boulder, Colorado.

Wiegand piloted his first introductory glider at 13 and on his 14th birthday, he became the youngest pilot in his flying club to solo a glider . He then flew to New York via Missouri - but stumbled when he arrived at Iqaluit, Canada and realised his passport was missing. The ambitious pilot, who hopes to break the Guinness World Record on his mission, had left it at home in his photocopier, where he had been making copies of it. His mistake cost him two days - which could scupper his chances of breaking the record. The hopeful pilot told the Fresno Bee that when he handed his passport case to a customs official, he was shocked when he was told it was not there.

After frantically searching his plane, and convinced he must have left it during one of his stops where he visited friends and family, he called his mother who organised a search party. But after the forgetful flyer recalled he had been making copies of his visas and identification, his mother discovered the passport at their home. His passport was shipped overnight, much to the relief of Wiegand. 'I was a little annoyed that I forgot it, but it was nice to get the extra rest,' he told the Fresno Bee. 'I had time built in my schedule for mishaps like this. I just didn't expect it to be my passport and more of something later down the road.' His ambitious route takes him through Mumbai, Rome, London, Bangkok and Tokyo in his quest to break the record . Jack Wiegand said he had factored in time for mishaps - but never thought it would be about forgetting his passport . After the mishap he flew directly to Reykjavik, Iceland in a seven-hour trip.

At just 14, he became the youngest pilot in the Central California Soaring Club to solofly a glider, and flew his first single-engine power plane solo when he was 16. The pilot is being sponsored on his tour, and donating the proceeds to Big Brothers Big Sisters, the largest youth mentoring program in the United States, and International Agri-Center Ag Warriors, an organization focused on benefiting returning veterans.

A couple of retired doctors have spent the past three years on a quest to taste the best burgers the U.S. has to offer. Joe and Doris Lindner were visiting their daughter in Denver, Colorado in October 2010 when they read a USA Today article listing the nation’s ‘51 Great Burger Joints.’ Noting that the Colorado recommendation, Park Burger, was nearby the couple decided to check it out. Joe and Doris Lindner have eaten burgers in all 50 states over the past three years and ended their journey in Hawaii in April . The Village Burger slider, voted America's best burger by Joe Lindner who has eaten burgers in all 50 states . Impressed with what they tasted, the couple then decided to also try the recommendations for the states they traveled through on their way home to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. By the time they got home, the couple had also tried the recommended burgers in Kansas, Missouri and Tennessee. ‘When we got home and realized we’d already done four, we said “why not?’” Doris Linder told Hawaii247, explaining how the hunt for a local burger recommendation had quickly turned into a cross-country challenge. Over the next three years the couple made it their mission to travel the length and breadth of the nation tasting great burgers from the list. Where it all began: The Linders started their burger odyssey at Park Burger in Denver back in Oct 2010 . The list included one joint for each state, plus the District of Columbia, each recommended by a local foodie. Due to the bad economy two places on the list closed before the Linders got to try their burgers, but even in those instances the couple still visited the joints and had their photos taken outside. By July 2012, the couple had ticked off all but one of the 51 joints listed in the original article. Then finally in April the Linders paid a visit to Hawaii to complete their burger odyssey with a trip to Village Burger Kamuela in Waimea. Symbolically the couple enjoyed their final burger from the list with the same members of their family that they had started the journey back in Denver in October 2010. In between they've tried all kinds of burger, some more exotic than others, including a kangaroo burger. The Lindners have visited all 51 burger joints on a list compiled by USA Today in 2010, including Char-Grill Hamburgers in North Carolina . When quizzed about which was the best burger, Joe Linder gave that precious accolade to the Village Burger slider, also the last burger on the list. ‘I’ve always said the best burger is the last one I ate. But I’ll be absolutely honest with you, that WAS the best one ever,’ said Joe. According to Joe the whole journey was about more than just trying out a lot of different types of burgers. ‘It’s really the people along the way that made it so much fun and a few who weren’t that charming,’ Joe Linder told Hawaii247. ‘But our country is so wonderful, whether it’s North Dakota or downtown Los Angeles, they all have their own flavor. It’s been a great time.’ How many have you tried? Check out the list of America's best burgers .

A group of purported Apple engineers has lifted the veil on the company to reveal what makes it one of the most famously secretive enterprises in the United States. Employees are told not to even speak to their wives about the projects they are working on. Black cloth shrouds cover new products when designers aren't working on them. Corporate security teams are looking over each engineer's shoulder at every turn, and a unique system called - what else - 'iTrack' is used to monitor every prototype device. Secrets: The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs is credited with setting the tone for his company's culture of intense secrecy . Several former employees and their . family members chimed in that 'fear' is what keeps leaks from coming out . - fear of immediate termination and massive lawsuits. Current employees, though, reported that it was love of the products that kept employees from blabbing about the newest gadgets that Apple is releasing. Many said they believe Apple fans genuinely want to be surprised by new products. The revelations come from the question-and-answer website Quora, which received two dozen responses when a user asked: 'How does Apple keep secrets so well.' The forum began last summer when rumors were beginning to swirl about the not-yet-released iPhone 5. Numerous users who claimed to be current or former Apple employees chimed in. Family members of Apple employees also added anecdotes about life at the company. Perhaps the most jaw-dropping response came Kim Scheinberg, the wife of former Apple engineer John Kullmann. Scheinberg told a story of how she happened to be in her husband's the office in 2001 when he revealed to his boss that he had developed a way for Apple's OS operating system to run on PCs with Intel processors. New images: Videos emerged days before the iPhone 5 release last year of a prototype of the new phone. It is thought that product was leaked from a Chinese factory . At the time not even Mr Kullmann's supervisor knew what he was doing. When he installed his version of the Apple operating system onto a Sony Vaio PC, his boss turned to Mr Kullmann and told him that his wife was to, 'forget everything I know, and he will not be allowed to speak to me about it again until it is publicly announced. 'I guess he had some kind of ""Total Recall"" memory wipe in mind,' Ms Scheinberg writes. Apple's jump to PC compatibility and using Intel chips in Macintosh computers was one of the biggest  announcements in its history when it went public in 2005. Another former engineer, Robert Bowdidge - who now works for Google - told a similar story when he was tapped to make Apple OS X run on PCs. 'I couldn't tell my wife anything; she knew I was working in a different building across the street and pulling very late nights, but she didn't know what I was doing,' he writes. New Apple CEO Tim Cook has only strengthened the anti-leak policies put in place by his predecessor . 'When I had to travel to Manchester UK... she asked to come along.  I had to say ""no way""... My parents heard I was travelling to England, but didn't hear anything else; they suspected I was involved with something related to the U.S. Government...' His own co-workers didn't know what he was working on. 'We were asked to just sort of disappear - the phrase I often use to describe it was ""make people think you've picked up a drug habit and aren't coming in regularly.""  I wasn't even allowed to tell my manager; all he knew is that I'd been borrowed for a secret project,' he writes. A poster who claimed to be a current Apple employee described tight security at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California. 'All prototypes are laser marked with serial numbers and tracked by a central tracking system (called iTrack).  Physical security is also highly prioritized, with prototypes required to be locked up when not in use,' the engineer writes. Locked down: Often times co-workers don't even know what other members of their group are working on, employees say . Brian Hoshi, a former Apple account executive, write that employees work under threat of being fired if they leak something. 'The secrecy is upheld throughout the organization knowing that there is a corporate security team pretty much looking over your shoulder at all times and where even minor violations are grounds for immediate termination,' he wrote. Labs where new products are developed are guarded by cameras, locked doors with key-card access available only to the few developers working on the project, and secretaries trained to monitor anyone who enters or leaves the area, said one poster who claimed a family member used to work for Apple. Apple take security, even in their very secure areas, just one step farther with a dramatic flourish: 'In labs, every project is kept under black cloths, just in case someone gets into a section they weren't supposed to be in,' the Quora poster writes. 'Plus the labs are all sectioned off and you have to sign into your part of the lab.'","Employees are told not to even speak to their wives about the projects they are working on .

Three mortuary managers could face prosecution after missing 10 chances to realise they had given the family of a paratrooper who died in custody the wrong body for burial. Christopher Adler's relatives unwittingly buried the body of a 77-year-old woman in 2000 but 11 years later it was realised there had been a mistake. The error was only discovered when the Nigerian family of Grace Kamara arrived to prepare her body for burial in November 2011. Former paratrooper: Three managers at the mortuary where Christopher Alder's body was found - more than a decade after he was supposed to have been buried in Hull, now 'may have a case to answer' Mr Alder, a 37-year-old Falklands war veteran, had died on the floor of a police station in the city in April 1998, with his arms handcuffed behind his back and his trousers around his ankles. South Yorkshire Police carried out a 15-month investigation into the incident which was when they realised that Mrs Kamara's body was where Mr Alder's should have been. The inquiry team ‘believe that three members of the management team of the mortuary between December 1, 1999 and November 4, 2011 may have a case to answer’, according to a summary. The report says: ‘The investigation . team have identified 10 occasions during this period of time when they . had the opportunity to identify that the body purporting to be Grace . Kamara was in fact Christopher Alder and working practices prevented . this. ‘The Crown Prosecution Service must . consider whether they have been “wilfully negligent” and whether the . evidence is sufficient to pass the evidential test to support a charge . and secure a successful prosecution for the criminal offence of . misconduct in a public office.’ Mr Alder was punched during an argument outside a nightclub in his home city of Hull in 2008. He was taken to hospital where he became hostile which has been put down to his head injury during previous investigations. He was discharged and police arrested him for breach of the peace. Tragedy: Mr Alder, a 37-year-old Falklands war veteran, died on the floor of a police station in Hull in 1998 . CCTV: By the time he arrived at Queen's Gardens police station, he was unconscious and his trousers were around his knees. He was left handcuffed on the floor while the four officers looked on and did nothing . By the time he arrived at Queen's Gardens police station he was unconscious and his trousers were around his knees. In the custody suite he was left handcuffed on the floor while four officers looked on and did nothing. They could allegedly be heard on CCTV footage making monkey noises as he lay dying for 11 minutes. They later claimed they thought he was ‘putting on an act’. But a damning report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found the men responsible of ‘unwitting racism’. 'Appalled': Mr Alder's sister Janet, 51, said she was angered by what appeared to have happened in the mortuary . It concluded that PC Matthew Barr, PC Neil Blakey, PC Nigel Dawson and Sergeant John Dunn - who all refused to co-operate with the IPCC investigation - were guilty of a ‘most serious neglect of duty’. The officers were charged with manslaughter but acquitted at Teesside Crown Court in 2002 on the orders of the trial judge. Mr Alder’s sister Janet, 51, said she was angered by what appeared to have happened in the mortuary, but added that if ‘working practices’ were to blame it raised the prospect of similar mistakes happening to other families. ‘I am absolutely appalled,’ she said. ‘If they’re saying it’s policy and procedures, it can’t have been the same people dealing with it all the time, so are they saying nobody did their job right? ‘I don’t believe that for one minute. If that’s the case how many times have they buried the wrong people? How can they be sure they haven’t done it before? 'If it’s down to policy and procedures there’s a good chance something like this has happened in the past and nobody knows about it.’ The mortuary was initially run by . Hull City Council before being taken over by Hull and East Yorkshire . Hospitals NHS Trust. Neither organisation would say when the transfer . took place. A spokesman for the trust said: ‘While this matter remains the subject of a criminal investigation the trust cannot comment.’ Trish . Dalby, the council’s corporate director for city services, said: ‘We . understand the file has been forwarded to the CPS for their . consideration and we are awaiting the outcome of their findings.’ South Yorkshire Police was asked to carry out the inquiry by Humberside Police because of the sensitive history of the case.

On New Year’s Day the EU brought airlines under its Emissions Trading Scheme, which levies a charge based on their carbon emissions. Chai Haibo, of the China Air Transport Association – which represents national flag carrier Air China – said its members would not co-operate. Threats: The China Air Transport Association, which represents airliners including Air China, said it will refuse to pay a new green tax for using airports in Europe . However the EU insisted it would not back down. Airlines which do not comply with the tax can be fined and even prohibited from flying into the European Union. It is claimed the plan could cost Chinese airlines £79million in extra annual costs. ‘The CATA, on behalf of Chinese airlines, is strongly against the EU’s improper practice of unilaterally forcing international airlines into its ETS,’ Mr Chai said. He said China would try to force Brussels to scrap the initiative, declaring: ‘If governments like the U.S., China and Russia can launch strong and forceful retaliatory measures, this will form enormous pressure and we hope could make the EU change its mind.’ Anger: A United Airlines flight takes off from Frankfurt Airport - one of Europe's busiest. Under the scheme, airlines will be given free credits this year, but in future will have to buy or trade them to cover the levy . However Isaac Valero-Ladron, EU spokesman for climate action, said: ‘We’re not modifying our law and we’re not backing down. 'We’re confident companies will comply. The penalties for non-compliance are much higher.’ The ETS requires airlines flying to or from Europe to obtain ‘permits to pollute’ for carbon dioxide emissions. The European Commission has assessed the impact on air fares at around £10.50 per passenger, per flight to the U.S. – or £84 for a family of four making a round trip. China warned it may bring in retaliatory measures against the levy, also criticised by India, the U.S. and Canada.","China threatens to side with U.S. and Russia in bid to get EU to back down .

Guilty: Dr Simon Heap, who along with his wife Gladys Effa-Heap, has received a one year suspended sentence for attempting to smuggle a Nigerian child into the UK . An academic and his wife have both been sentenced for trying to smuggle a baby into the country, it was revealed today. Dr Simon Heap and his wife Gladys Effa-Heap, a nurse, flew out to Nigeria and tried to dupe officials into believing a baby girl they wanted to bring back to the UK was theirs. However, the Oxford pair were actually trying to illegally adopt the baby. Dr Heap, a 47-year-old expert on Nigeria who works with companies trying to forge international trade links, and his 52-year-old partner claimed she had given birth just days after landing in the African country. The ruse included producing a birth certificate which suspicious British High Commission staff examined and found to be fake. Officials requested DNA testing of the baby girl and the couple which proved she was not biologically theirs. The pair then left the baby in Nigeria and flew back to the UK, sparking an investigation into the baby smuggling. Today the couple were convicted of breaching immigration law and handed 12 month prison sentences, suspended for 12 months. They were also ordered to complete 250 hours of community service each by a judge at Isleworth Crown Court after admitting the offence, which took palce in July 2010. A spokesman for the Border Force said: 'A couple from Oxford have been convicted of attempting to pass off a Nigerian baby as their own so they could bring it back to the UK, following a joint Border Force and Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation. 'They later went to the British High Commission in Lagos where they applied for a British passport for the baby girl, claiming Mrs Effa-Heap had given birth within days of them arriving in Nigeria. 'However, staff became suspicious and DNA tests later confirmed that neither adult was related to the child. A birth certificate they had presented was also found to be fraudulent. They flew home without the baby.' Following an investigation, officers from Operation Paladin, a specialist Border Force and MPS team tasked with safeguarding children, they were arrested and charged with facilitating a breach of immigration law. Marc Owen, head of Border Force at Heathrow, said: 'This was a shocking case where a couple attempted to pass someone else's baby off as their own in an attempt to bring it to the UK. 'Thanks to the close co-operation between Border Force, the Metropolitan Police and staff at the British High Commission they were stopped and we were able to bring them to justice.' Detective Inspector Kate Bridger, who leads the Paladin team, said: 'A child should not be treated as a commodity to be bought and sold. Dr Heap, pictured in Nigeria. he is an expert on the African country and advises companies on how to forge trade links there . 'This couple attempted to circumvent the adoption system and deceive the authorities. 'That system is in place to protect children and we will do all we can to bring to justice those who try and get round it in this kind of way.' Dr Heap was awarded the first Britain - Nigeria Educational Trust Commonwealth Fellowship at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. The Cambridge University graduate has also held the post of Global Research Portfolio Coordinator at Plan International, an NGO working to improve the lives of children in 66 countries around the world. He was also awarded the Kirk-Greene Junior Research Fellow in Tropical African Studies at St Antony's College, Oxford, and now works at forging trade relations between Nigeria and Japan.

When radio legend Big George died in 2011, his partner of five years grieved for him ... and then for their relationship. What his girlfriend Jo Good thought was an honest partnership was revealed to be a sham as the reality that he was still with his wife surfaced shortly after his passing. George Webley, 53, who composed TV theme tunes for Have I Got News For You and The Office earned the nickname Big George, died after suffering a massive heart attack following taking the party drug mephedrone. An affair to remember: When Big George Webley (pictured) died, the extent of his double life was revealed . The father-of-four from Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, was found struggling for breath at his home by his wife, Sheila in May 2011 and was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived. A statement on the family website after his death said: 'Our hearts go out to all those who share our loss.' What nobody was aware of, though, was that George had been living a double life, betraying the two women closest to him. As far as Barking at the Moon radio show presenter Jo Good was concerned, he was separated and they were an official, public celebrity couple together. But then she found out he hadn't left his wife and had been living a double life throughout their relationship. The couple met at BBC Radio London and bonded . over a mutual love of animals and the arts, and, after much convincing, . Jo felt assured that while George lived in the family home he and his . wife were living separate lives. John Kennedy and Jo Good at All Souls Church where 300 turned out to celebrate George's life . The couple even got two dogs together, . nicknamed their 'furkids'. Jo admits this brought out maternal feelings . she never thought she had. George had convinced Jo he and his 'estranged' wife were not together and only crossed paths when he was visiting his children and grandchildren. But George had been staying with wife Sheila with whom he was still very much together all along - and in fact Jo had been the other woman. For Jo, being labelled as the other woman immediately devalued her as his partner and - most devastatingly - devalued her allowance to grieve. Their relationship was effectively erased from his past. Talking to The Mirror, Jo said: 'There's an aspect [to grieving] I'd never thought about until I lost my own . soulmate - that there's some sort of scale of mourning and loss, and . that one person's grief has more importance than another's. 'I'd been a . mistress for five years - even though I didn't know it - so when my . beloved George died, my grief was of less value than that of his late . wife,' And so she felt she was not allowed to express her sadness like any loving partner should. After his passing when the family home was emptied by relatives and Jo was not contacted once, George's real situation became clear. 'I discovered George had left his locker . at work open.

Daniel Veness from Suffolk who was was ordered to attend a sex offenders program - but it was cancelled . A paedophile molested a sleeping five-year-old girl after his sex-offenders treatment was cancelled. Daniel Veness, 23, was ordered to get urgent help after he was caught with 600 vile child pornography pictures on his computer. But a lack of 'resources' meant that the scheme was scrapped. Veness, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, filmed himself carrying out the sickening sex attack on the little girl as she slept. He was jailed for two years eight months yesterday. Judge David Goodin branded the pervert a danger to young girls. The judge said it was 'a matter of great regret' that two years in to a three-year order Veness's treatment programme had not started. Judge Goodin said this was initially because the offender had been on holiday. But since then Veness had been given two start dates in March and October 2012 which had been called off because of 'insufficient resources'. The paedophile was arrested in January after a shocked friend told police he had seen pornographic images of naked girls on Veness's mobile. Officers found 46 indecent pictures of children on the phone as well as film footage Veness had taken of himself sexually assaulting the five-year-old as she was asleep. The judge at Ipswich Crown Court imposed an extended licence period of three years because of the danger he poses to young girls . Veness admitted sexual touching, two offences of taking indecent pictures of a child and downloading indecent images of children. He also admitted breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and failing to notify police of a change in his address under the terms of the sex offenders' register. As well as jailing him at Ipswich Crown Court, Judge Goodin also imposed an extended licence period of three years because of the danger he poses to young girls. Veness was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register and made the subject of an indefinite sexual offences prevention order. He had been given a caution for sexual activity with a girl under the age of 13 in November 2008, the court heard. Last night the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said the case was 'distressing' and insisted that it was vital the treatment is carried out. Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust have launched an investigation into why the paedophile's treatment was cancelled . Judge Goodin said the Thames Valley Treatment Programme had been a crucial part of a three-year community order imposed at the court in March 2011 after the indecent photos were found on Veness's computer. 'This is a programme of high repute which is known to have some effect,' he said. Andrew Thompson, defending, said it was unfortunate that Veness had not received any help. Mr Thompson said: 'We will never know if it would have directed him away from the behaviour that has brought him back before the court.' Stuart Macdonald, director of Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust, today said they had launched an investigation in to the case. Mr Macdonald said: 'Our thoughts are with the victim and family at this incredibly difficult time. 'It would be wrong to comment further at this stage as the case is yet to be fully investigated. 'All cases involving a serious further offence are reviewed robustly and rigorously by Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust and the National Offender Management Service. 'Where deficiencies in the management of risk of serious harm are identified, action is taken to address these.' Jon Brown, head of strategy and development for sexual abuse at the NSPCC, said: 'This is a distressing case where an offender has been convicted twice and the level of abuse since his first conviction has clearly escalated. 'In these cases it is vital that treatment should always be carried out to prevent further abuse. 'We hope the victims have also been provided with support and treatment to help them through their traumatic experiences.' If you are an adult and you have concerns about the safety of a child, you can call the NSPCC's helpline on 0808 800 5000.

The sale has now taken place and the neighbours say they are locked in an 'anxious waiting game' as they still have no idea who won the bid and what lies in store for their gardens.

Before the sale went ahead he said: 'I would technically be trespassing across someone else's land to get to my front door. What if the owner refused to let me access my own home? What would I do?' Four strips of land in Marine Parade, Beck Road and Zider Pass in Canvey were sold at a London auction in February for £4,800 to a private bidder after Essex County Council put them up for sale. Mike Bering, 61, of Marine Parade, said: 'Poor Mark over the road has got to walk over that land every day to get to his house, and you never know the new owner could just turn around and forbid him access. 'Since the auction we have heard nothing from the council and are still none the wiser about who owns it. It's just a waiting game to see who turns up and what they decide to do.

Despite being located on three separate roads, the plots were sold as a single lot in the sale by Lambert Smith Hampton. The four families, who had been renting the land for up to 25 years, rallied together to bid for the plots but were outbid but an unknown buyer. Jean Graham, 65, of Beck Road said: 'We are all really anxious to find out what's going on. 'All we know was it was sold to a private individual.

'Essex County Council is awaiting completion of the purchase through the buyer's solicitors, and once the sale is complete the owner's details will be a matter of public record at the Land Registry. 'In the meantime, the council provided the buyers' solicitor's details on 3rd April to a Canvey Island resident following a direct request.

Novice explorer Philip Goodeve-Docker, 30, was sheltering in a tent with two fellow trekkers as a storm with winds of up to 95mph howled across the ice. The gales ripped away part of the tent, leaving the three men exposed to the freezing gale. They radioed for help, but it took rescue teams 24 hours to find them. Tragic: Philip Goodeve-Docker, 30, froze to death after being caught in a bitter storm in Greenland . Chief Inspector Paul Pitersen, of . Greenland police, said: ‘By the time we got to them Mr Goodeve-Docker . had frozen to death. They were very unlucky. They were simply in the . wrong place at the wrong time.’ His friends, Andy Norman and Roan Hackney, were rescued and are being treated in hospital for frostbite and other injuries. Mr Goodeve-Docker left his home in . Ealing, West London, last Thursday for the trip with experienced . expedition leader Mr Hackney and Mr Norman, 33, a former IT . professional. He was raising money for charity and . dedicated the trip to the memory of his grandfather, a former vice- . president of the Royal Geographical Society who died in 2011. His family, of Stockbridge, . Hampshire, were yesterday too upset to comment. They wrote on his . Facebook page: ‘On Sunday morning we had a phone call to confirm that . Philip sadly died.

Mr Goodeve-Docker, who was embarking . on his first trip and had been ‘training furiously’, wrote about the . dangers of one of the most ‘deadly landscapes in the world’. The events manager estimated the trek . from east to west across the Greenland ice sheet, the world’s second . largest, would take 30 to 35 days. He wrote: ‘We will travel 550-600km . across one of the most dazzling,  beautiful, yet barren and deadly . landscapes in the world, dragging all our own supplies (between . 100-135kg). ‘This is one of the great polar . challenges, through which we face such dangers as polar bears (not cute . and cuddly), crevasses up to 500+ metres deep, polar winds, temperatures . of 5C to -50C, plus the horror of three men with one tent and no . washing. ‘Part of my reasons for this frankly nutty adventure is my grandfather, Patrick Pirie-Gordon, who passed away two years ago.’ Mr Pirie-Gordon, who had helped fund . polar exploration as treasurer and honorary vice-president of the Royal .

The study involved 1.5 million people in Ontario, Canada, and the statins involved were fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin . People taking statins face an increased risk of developing diabetes, warn researchers. They found a 10 per cent extra risk linked to taking simvastatin – the most commonly prescribed anti-cholesterol drug – which rose to 22 per cent for those taking atorvastatin. Previous research into a suspected link with statins found a 9 per cent rise in the chance of patients developing diabetes, but the new study looked at specific brands of drug. The study involved 1.5 million people in Ontario, Canada, and the statins involved were fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Researchers identified 471,250 patients with no history of diabetes and . who were newly treated with a statin, just over half were women and all . were at least 66 years old. Statin therapy was started between 1997 and 2010 and individuals were . followed for a maximum of five years following the initiation of . statins, whichever came first. The Statins included in the study were: . fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and . rosuvastatin. The research used pravastatin-treated patients as the comparison group . as this has been shown to have favourable effects on newly diagnosed . diabetes in animal models and clinical trials. The overall risk of developing diabetes was low but this risk was increased among some patients taking statins. The study found between 162 and 407 patients would have to be treated . with the various statins for one extra patient to develop diabetes. Patients treated with atorvastatin had a 22 per cent increased risk of . new-onset diabetes, rosuvastatin an 18 per cent increased risk and . simvastatin a 10 per cent increased risk, relative to pravastatin. In contrast, patients treated with fluvastatin were at a five per cent lower risk and lovastatin a one per cent decreased risk. The findings also suggest older patients are at an increased risk . regardless of dose for atorvastatin and simvastatin or whether therapy . is used for prevention in people thought likely to develop heart disease . or to stop it worsening. The researchers say several factors may explain the increased risk of . new-onset diabetes among patients receiving certain statins including . impaired insulin secretion and inhibited insulin release. The researchers said doctors should consider risk when prescribing . statin therapy and they may want to switch patients to a ‘low-risk’ type. Previous research into a suspected link with statins found a 9 per cent rise in the chance of patients developing diabetes, but the new study looked at specific brands of drug . Experts say the absolute risk of diabetes is low - far lower than the benefits of statins in cutting heart attacks and deaths. More than eight million adults take statins, with most taking 20-40 mg . of simvastatin a day. They are the most widely prescribed drugs in the . UK, with about 61 million prescriptions in England alone in 2011. Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, . said: 'Statins are taken safely by millions in the UK and protect those . at high risk of developing coronary heart disease. ‘Although this study suggests an increased risk of older people . developing diabetes when taking certain statins, other risk factors like . being overweight, family history and ethnicity may have played their . part. ‘There are benefits and risks with all medicines so if you’re worried, . discuss your concerns with your GP.

Meanwhile John gained the Torpedo Badge medal, which he was posthumously awarded for his service on a different vessel. The schooner, a ship with two or more masts, was built in 1878 by Troon Shipbuilding Co in Scotland. Figures show 14,287 British merchant navy sailors died during World War One. The deadly German UC-72 submarine downed 38 ships during the war using a deadly combination of torpedoes and mines. Both . sets of medals, along with bronze plaques given to their relatives . after they died, will go under the hammer at Maxwells Auctioneers in . Stockport in July. Medal . expert Andrew McCann, who is handling the sale, said: 'Only a handful of . boys Sydney's age would have served in the merchant navy. 'There has been some confusion over his age, because his descendants who gave us the lot believed him to be 15. 'But records in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission show him to be 14. Family portrait: Sydney Cawsey (left) with older brother Jack (right). The 13-year-old was a cook on the ship . Sydney Cawsey was awarded the British War Medal, which was a campaign medal of the British Empire, for service in World War I. It was given to officers and men of British and Imperial forces who had served between 5 August 1914 and 11 November 1918. It was later given to those involved in the min clearing the years afterwards. One side of the silver disk features King George V bareheaded effigy, facing left, while the other side shows St George, on horseback with a shirt sword. There were 6,500,000 of these medals issued. The 13 yeah old was also given a mercantile Marine War Medal, which was as awarded by the Board of Trade of the United Kingdom to members of the Merchant Navy. The bronze medal also features King George, but the reverse show a a merchant ship sailing through stormy seas, an enemy submarine sinking and a sailing vessel in the background. Sydney's father John was awarded the Torpedo Badge medal for services on a different vessel during he war. 'However, when we dug further we saw that the 1911 census put his birth year as 1904, which would make him 13 years and nine months old - one of the youngest sailors in the war. 'The fact he died with his father makes it such a poignant story, because in all my years of historical study we have never encountered a similar instance.' Sydney and John were sailing with ship's mate John Mactaggart Taylor, Dubliner Andrew McLoughlin, and Edward Campbell who was born in Barbados. Despite the risks of attack from enemy submarines John's wife Mary Anne and his daughter would sometimes accompany them on their trips up and down the channel. The medal collection is expected to fetch £600-£800 at auction but could reach a higher price. Mr McCann added: 'We've put a relatively low estimate on it I would say, but with something like this the sky's the limit. 'There are loads of medal collectors out there, and a lot with a story like this will inevitably attract a lot of attention. 'We've got them from descendants of the family, who for whatever reason feel no connection to the pieces. 'It's surprising how common it is for families to sell off heirlooms you think would have priceless sentimental value.' The Cawsey family experienced a huge amount of tragedy in the early 1900's. Sydney's older brother, who shared . his name, died in his infancy and another brother died at sea when he . was just three years old. John Carter Cawsey and Sydney Cawsey are both commemorated on the Merchant Navy Monument at Tower Hill, London. Their names are also recorded on the war memorial in their home town of Appledore, North Devon.

Sydney is one of the youngest victims of the conflict . For King and country: Many young boys replied to Lord Kitchener's call for volunteers . While a 13-year-old boy at war was an unusual sight, World War One brought out the patriotic side of the nation. This led tens-of-thousands of men to answer Lord Kitchener’s call for volunteers, and to sign up at their local recruitment office. The swell in national pride encouraged thousands of underage boys who were willing to lie about their age and identity to try and get a piece of the action. You had to be 19 to legally sign up to go to war, if you were 18 you could enlist but not go abroad. But, come the start of The Great War, recruitment officers took the role that it a young man wanted to enlist and was physically able to do so, then there was no reason to stop him. It is impossible to know for certain how many boy soldiers there were during World War One, but it is thought that as many as 250,000 underage boys enlisted and went abroad. Some young boys not only lied about their age, but their name as well. This ensured that worried parents could not track their sons down and report them to their commanding officer. Even gravestones in war grave cemeteries show the ‘official’ ages, or the ones that the boys claimed to be. It is thought that by the end of the war, many of the young boys who were so desperate to fight for King and country had been injured or killed.

Her story inspired MailOnline readers and hundreds got in touch to offer their support and offer what help they could.

It said: 'Our beautiful and brave Stephanie fell asleep at 5.45pm and she was with her family and pets and was very peaceful. 'She will now watch over us all with her fairy wings and dazzling eyes that will shine bright in the night sky. Crossed off the list: Stephanie fulfilling one of her dreams of meeting Take That's Gary Barlow, who dropped in for a cup of tea and a sing song . 'Since September 2009 we have been side . by side with our Steph on a journey that no parent wants to make and no . family wants to be passengers on. 'Stephanie was only here for 21 years but her courage and kindness and what she inspired will be marked in history forever and she will be smiling about that. 'So as our angel goes up to heaven to find her baby brother and look after him until we see them both again I hope you will all continue to follow Stephs legacy and be inspired to help others and achieve whatever makes you happy. 'Steph had a good four months [after the diagnosis that her cancer was terminal] to do most of her wishes and more importantly for Steph to make new memories with the people she loved the most for them to remember always and she achieved that 100 per cent. Steph's mother Cindy said: 'We are now faced with life without our beautiful, brave, loving and inspirational daughter/sister/granddaughter/auntie/cousin and friend and at the moment this breaks our hearts in two' 'We are now faced with life without our beautiful, brave,loving and inspirational daughter/ sister/granddaughter/auntie/cousin and friend and at the moment this breaks our hearts in two and we feel like lost souls without our Stephanie.' The message added: 'Steph was lucky to be able to tick off many of the wishes on her bucket list and received a few surprises along the way, including the visit of Gary Barlow.' After hearing of her death Gary Barlow tweeted: 'Lets all say a prayer for Stephanie Knight tonight! Beautiful girl.' Stephanie, from Braughing, Hertfordshire, was diagnosed with the disease when she was just17 after doctors found a tumour the size of a tennis ball behind her pelvis. Tragic: Steph's mother Cindy posted the news of her death on Facebook . Gary Barlow's tribute to Steph, who died on Wednesday . Over the next four years she raised more than £40,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. After her plight came to to light in January, the public and celebrities . joined forces to make the last few months of her life as special as . they could be. In late February, Stephanie had the rather . surreal experience of having Gary Barlow singing in her living room. Rite of passage: Steph with two of the 'Dreamboys' who made cocktails at her fake hen do .

They were treated like VIPs by the manager with . free cocktails and a photographer on hand. Steph with the magician Dynamo (l) who showed her some card tricks, and a message from Robbie Williams . It's magic: Dynamo showed off a number of card tricks and managed to guess which card Steph was thinking of . 'It . was a really great experience. I felt well that day, which was unusual . as I often have to escape to have a rest,' Steph said. Another rite of passage Steph experienced was her own fake hen night, replete with 44 female friends . and family and some topless waiters. She also met the Tottenham Hotspur football team - because she loves being able to treat her family. 'My brother Lloyd has been a Tottenham fan since he was little. He's 25 but he turned into a hormonal teenager when he met them!' she said. 'I loved watching his reactions. We got to see the team training and then speak to them afterwards. 'AVB (the manager Andre Villas Boas) gave Lloyd his jacket and whistle, which was a huge deal.' Footballer Jermain Defoe said: 'It was great for us . to meet Stephanie.

Mrs Knight said before her daughter's death: 'Steph has been teaching as a nursery nurse nearby. It's what she's wanted to do from the age of 11. 'She does one-to-ones helping them . with their reading and writing. She is often given the more challenging . ones as she has a way with her that they really respond to. Spending time in the school makes her feel normal.' Steph is now setting up a charity, . called Steph's Wishes, after receiving so many donations via her . website. It will help 18 to 24-year-olds who have cancer, especially . those who have relapsed. 'The first time you have cancer who go in so positive,' Steph said.

'I want the charity to fund bucket list wishes whether it's a day out or to meet someone special.' And despite all the hardships she has been through she said before she died that she wouldn't have changed anything. 'I'm a better person because of this and we're closer as a family,' she said. 'We shrug off the small things now as they don't matter. We take lots of pictures and laugh. 'If I could give one bit of advice I would say don't take life so seriously.

Lashing out: Neil Whittaker-Axon, 39, repeatedly punched a 65-year-old cyclist who had complained about being 'cut up' A bus driver jumped 80 feet to his death from a bridge following a road rage attack on a grandfather. Neil Whittaker-Axon, 39, had been fired after repeatedly punching a 65-year-old cyclist who complained about being 'cut up' in Manchester city centre. The father of two said he had 'embarrassed his family' by losing his job at bus firm Finglands. Although he found other work, he had a mental breakdown and became paranoid, claiming that someone had given him a pie which was poisoned and that he was being watched by police and social services. After telling a psychiatrist he had three choices - going to hospital, getting shot in the head or killing himself, Mr Whittaker-Axon plunged from the top of an aqueduct near Stockport, Greater Manchester. A post mortem examination revealed he had died from head injuries, which are believed to have been caused by his impact with the water. An inquest in Stockport was told that Mr Whittaker-Axon, from Manchester, had been married with two children, but his relationship ended in 2004 after he struggled with being a parent. His former wife Jessica told the hearing: 'He always kept himself busy and liked keeping fit by mountain biking. He struggled about being a father. He wanted to live a free life. 'During the latter stages of the marriage, I felt like he was drinking a lot. I mentioned it to him but he refused to admit that he had a drink problem.' In November 2011, Mr Whittaker-Axon was convicted of common assault at Manchester Magistrates' Court. No details of the assault were given at the inquest, but retired joiner Harry Clare told the trial he had been cycling through the city centre when the double-decker driven by Mr Whittaker-Axon forced him on to the pavement. The grandfather followed the vehicle to Manchester Piccadilly bus station and went up to the driver's window, thinking he might get an apology. But Mr Whittaker-Axon leaned out and began hitting him, then lifting him off the ground by his collar and smashing his sunglasses. At the time, Mr Clare told the court: 'I thought the guy might have apologised to me and I followed him there to say, ""what on earth is the problem?"". His body language said he wasn't going to shake my hand. I heard the window slam. 'He reached out and grabbed me by the back of the collar of my clothing. He yanked me to the side of the bus. I felt my head banging against something and something banging against my helmet.' Mr Whittaker-Axon insisted he was defending himself but was fined £150 and ordered to pay £100 costs and £175 compensation to the cyclist. Last June, he was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital under the Mental Health Act after calling police the previous night, talking about being kidnapped. He told officers he believed he had been under surveillance and that his mobile and iPad had been hacked. Neighbours complained of him running around in the street wearing only his trousers and police tracked him down at an industrial estate in Stockport. Consultant psychologist Dr Aman Gupta, who treated Mr Whittaker-Axon, said he was 'very paranoid' and had complained about hearing voices. 'Psychotic episode': The father of two was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital in June after calling the police, talking about being kidnapped. A month later, he jumped off the aqueduct and died . Dr Gupta said: 'He said somebody had given him a pie which was poisoned, his toothpaste was poisoned, he was being watched by the police and social services. 'He complained of having embarrassed his family. 'He said he had three choices - going to hospital, getting shot in the head or killing himself.' On July 11, Mr Whittaker-Axon was spotted jumping from the aqueduct into the water, leaving behind a black rucksack, brown jacket and silver keys. Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'We know he had a period as an in-patient for what appeared to be a psychotic episode. Having heard the evidence, it leads me to conclude that he has taken his own life.' An earlier version of this article suggested that Mr Whittaker-Axon took his life as a result of being fired from his position at Finglands bus firm.  We are happy to clarify that this was not the case and that there were other contributing factors.

A babysitter accused of killing a toddler in her care has been sentenced to three years' probation after accepting a plea deal. Megan Martzen, 22, pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter, after her trial for the murder of 17-month-old Ella VanLeeuwen ended in a hung jury in February. Ella was injured while she and her older brother were in Martzen's care at their home in Reedley, California, in 2009. The little girl died three days later. Plea deal: Babysitter Megan Martzen, seen outside the court in California yesterday, was sentenced to three years probation after pleading 'no contest' to involuntary manslaughter . The VanLeeuwen family blamed the babysitter, while Martzen told police that Ella sustained the injuries after falling from her bed. Martzen accepted a felony conviction in exchange for a sentence of probation, after the murder trial ended in a mistrial. The 22-year-old is officially not a murderer, but by pleading no contest to the charge of involuntary manslaughter, she admitted playing a role in the toddler's death, according to abcnews.com. Speaking outside Fresno County Court ahead of the sentencing, Martzen said: 'I would've never done anything to hurt Ella, I loved her so much. 'My heart hurts for the family.' Plea deal: 'My heart hurts for the family', Martzen said ahead of her appearance at Fresno County Court (pictured) in California . Judge Edward Sarkisian said at the hearing: 'Everyone in this courtroom loves Ella VanLeeuwen, and if Ella was physically here, she'd say she also loves everyone in this courtroom.' Ella's parents Todd and Deniele VanLeeuwen were at the emotional hearing. The family's pastor Dennis Fast told the judge: 'Todd and Deniele told me they have forgiven Megan for whatever happened that day.' Martzen's family told Action News they hope that the once close families will reconcile in the future. 'We know that healing will occur,' her father-in-law John Martzen said. At present Martzen is only allowed to spend 48 hours per week with her son Maverick, according to abcnews.com. Maverick lives with his father, while Martzen lives with her mother. Martzen was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service, according to a report in the Fresno Bee.","Megan Martzen was accused of killing 17-month-old Ella VanLeeuwen in 2009 .

The Mercedes sedan smashed through the wall of the ANZ branch in Adelaide, Australia, leaving a large hole in the side of the bank. The 72-year-old pedestrian, from Marino, had been walking through the Marion shopping centre car park with a friend when he was hit. The pedestrian died after being hit by the out-of-control which smashed into the wall of the ANZ bank branch . He died from his injuries but the 62-year-old woman he was walking with suffered only minor injuries. Witnesses reportedly heard the car accelerate and its horn being hit before crashing into the wall at about 2pm on Monday. Two people who were inside the bank at the time of the fatal crash suffered minor injuries. Pictures from the scene showed the Mercedes embedded in the wall of the shopping centre bank branch. Rubble and brick dust could be seen around the car and wires handing from the wall after police removed a cordon. The authorities spent hours removing the sedan from the crash scene. Two people were also injured in the ANZ bank branch when the elderly driver lost control in the car park . The 81-year-old driver was in a serious condition after the smash, which police say may have been caused when he was taken ill behind the wheel . Investigators believe the driver may have suffered a medical episode before crashing. The 81-year-old man was initially trapped inside the car before being transferred to hospital. He was reported to be in a serious condition. Chief Inspector Trevor Lovegrove said it was too early to be certain of how it happened. He told Adelaide Now: 'It's extremely lucky that there weren't other people walking through the car park at the time. 'This is absolutely tragic. It's circumstances which no one could predict. It's a tragedy for the families that this man has lost his life.'","Mercedes sedan smashed through the wall of the ANZ branch in Adelaide .

Now Michael Alleyne Senior (left) - the father of one of his killers - has received £20,000 compensation from police for injuries and 'trauma' he suffered when they raided his flat . 'Disappointed': Brooke Kinsella, pictured on This Morning, said it felt her brother's murderer Michael Alleyne Jnr may benefit from Ben's death . Speaking on This morning, Brooke said: 'I don't have many words to be honest. I'm disappointed obviously. 'I understand this man was injured and I understand there is a system is in place for things like that and its this system that I think it flawed, because as a family, of course, in our eyes, had his son not murdered my brother, the police wouldn't have been there. 'In our eyes, if this man decides to put some of that money away for when his son gets out, the murderer has benefited from Ben's death.'

But Brooke, who has campaigned against knife-crime, pointed out that the payment comes at a time when the public funding is already pushed to brink. She added: 'On a higher scale, this money comes out of public money and at a time when there are cuts to police, to NHS, the services that help victims when there's charities out there that cannot get a penny of funding to do work. 'It just seems unjust to us - these are the things that go through your head as a family. 'As I said, I know this man was injured, and there is a system for this but it just always seems - and we've said it many times - the systems are not geared towards victims in many cases. For us, personally, its just heartbreaking.' She said: 'It's tough because it's not just my family, there are so many out there and that's the thing, you try and be positive and try and make a difference in some way and this just brings it all back. 'For us there's always something else that brings it all back. 'It does make it harder,' she added before apologising as she wiped away her tears. Star pupil and promising artist Ben was stabbed 11 times in a street after a night out celebrating the end of his GCSEs. Alleyne Jnr is currently serving a life sentence for his killing. Mr Alleyne Snr has now been handed £20,000 in public money as compensation for the injuries and 'trauma'.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 01:01 EST, 25 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:29 EST, 25 May 2013 . The trucker was hauling drilling equipment when his load bumped against the steel framework over an Interstate 5 bridge. He looked in his rearview mirror and watched in horror as the span collapsed into the water behind him. Two vehicles fell into the icy Skagit River. Amazingly, nobody was killed. The three people who fell into the water escaped with only minor injuries. Officials are trying to find out whether the spectacular collapse of a bridge on one of the West's most important roadways was a fluke - or a sign of a bigger problem with thousands of bridges across the U.S. Authorities focused first on trying to find a temporary span for the Skagit, although it won't come in time for the tens of thousands of Memorial Day vacationers who would travel between Canada and Seattle. Scroll down for video . The bridge collapse that sent cars and drivers tumbling into a frigid river in Washington state appears to have been caused when a semi-trailer truck carrying an oversize load struck a bridge support beam . Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Friday declared a state of emergency in three counties around the bridge, saying that the bridge collapse has caused extensive disruption, impacting the citizens and economy . Revelations: The bridge was reportedly listed as one of the state's structurally deficient bridges . Rescue effort: Workers form a human chain as they begin to remove a woman from a vehicle in the water . Lucky escape: A man is seen sitting atop a car that fell into the Skagit River after the bridge collapse . 'You cannot overstate the importance of this corridor to Washington state,' Gov. Jay Inslee said. Traffic on I-5 and surrounding roads was backed up for miles, a situation the governor said would continue indefinitely. Officials were looking for a temporary, pre-fabricated bridge to replace the 160-foot section that failed, Inslee said Friday. If one is found, it could be in place in weeks. If not, it could be months before a replacement can be built, the governor said. The spectacular collapse unfolded about 7 p.m. Thursday on the north end of the four-lane bridge near Mount Vernon, about 60 miles north of Seattle and 40 miles south of the Canada border. 'He looked in the mirrors and it just dropped out of sight,' Cynthia Scott, the wife of truck driver William Scott, said from the couple's home near Spruce Grove, Alberta. 'I spoke to him seconds after it happened. He was just horrified.' The truck driver works for Mullen Trucking in Alberta, the Washington State Patrol said. The tractor-trailer was hauling a housing for drilling equipment southbound when the top right front corner of the load struck several of the bridge's trusses, the patrol said. Scott, 41, remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators. He voluntarily gave a blood sample for an alcohol test and was not arrested. Scott has been driving truck for 20 years and hauling specialized loads for more than 10. 'He gets safety awards, safety bonuses ... for doing all these checks, for hiring the right pilot cars and pole cars,' his wife said. Initially, it wasn't clear if the bridge just gave way on its own. But Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste blamed it on the tall load. The truck made it off the bridge, but two other vehicles went into the water about 25 feet below as the structure crumbled. Dan Sligh and his wife were in their pickup heading to a camping trip when he said the bridge before them disappeared in a 'big puff of dust.' 'I hit the brakes and we went off,' Sligh told reporters from a hospital. Damage: The first pictures of the scene show that both the north and southbound lanes of the Interstate highway collapsed on Thursday evening just before 7pm . Rescue: Three people were initially pulled from the water alive, though there remained concerns about other possible passengers who were trapped by debris . Collapse: The section of the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River is seen in an aerial view . Bryce Kenning, of Mount Vernon, said the bridge seemed to explode in front of him. The 20-year-old slammed the brakes and could see the edge of the pavement approaching, but there was nothing he could do. 'It was like time was frozen - like a roller coaster where you're not attached to the tracks,' Kenning said in a phone interview. 'I'm sure it was just one of the loudest sounds ever to hear this thing explode and fall into the water like that, but I didn't hear a thing. I just witnessed it happening in front of me.' Ed Scherbinski, vice president of Mullen Trucking, said in an interview with The Associated Press that state officials had approved of the company's plan to drive the oversize load along I-5 to Vancouver, Wash., and the company hired a local escort to help navigate the route. Mike Allende, a state Department of Transportation spokesman, confirmed the truck had a permit. 'We're still trying to figure out why it hit the bridge,' Allende said. 'It's ultimately up to the trucking company to figure out whether it can get through.' State officials approved the trucking company to carry a load as high as 15 feet, 9 inches, according to the permit released by the state. However, the southbound vertical clearance on the Skagit River bridge is as little as 14 feet, 5 inches, state records show. That lowest clearance is outside of the bridge's vehicle traveling lanes, Transportation Department communications director Lars Erickson said Friday. The bridge's curved overhead girders are higher in the center of the bridge but sweep lower toward a driver's right side. The bridge has a maximum clearance of about 17 feet, but there is no signage to indicate how to safely navigate the bridge with a tall load. The permit specifically describes the route the truck would take, though it includes a qualification that the state 'Does Not Guarantee Height Clearance.' It's not rare for trucks to strike bridges in Washington state - it's just that such accidents don't usually cause the structures to collapse. The state DOT said there were 21 bridge-strikes involving trucks last year, 24 in 2011 and 14 in 2010. Officials performed a special inspection six months ago of the bridge that collapsed because there were indications it had been struck by a different vehicle. Desperate search: Eyewitnesses said that they could hear a man screaming from one of the trucks that fell in the water . Troubled water: Both the north and south bound lanes of the interstate were effected so much of the nearby highway was closed in order to prevent any other accidents . Scary: Though the water was not particularly deep where the collapse occurred, there were a number of other factors that could prove threatening for the passengers inside the cars, like this overturned one . Questions: There are unconfirmed reports that a large truck hit something to unsteady the bridge but investigators are still looking into what caused the unexpected collapse . A report released Friday says the checkup was done due to 'impact damage,' and inspectors identified tears, deformations and gouges on the northbound side of the bridge. The report also summarizes a variety of parts on the bridge that have been subjected to 'high-load' hits. In that Nov. 29, 2012, impact, an overheight truck struck a metal overhead truss on the bridge, DOT spokeswoman Broch Bender said. An inspection crew 'thoroughly investigated and determined the bridge to be safe,' with only minor repairs required. She said those minor repairs were added to an existing list of bridge maintenance items to be completed at a future date. There are no signs leading up to the Skagit River bridge to warn about its clearance height. State Transportation Secretary Lynn Peterson said that under federal and state standards, the clearance is tall enough to not require signage. Inslee said it will cost $15 million to repair the bridge. The federal government has already promised the state $1 million in emergency funding. Traffic could be affected for some time. The bridge is used by an average of 71,000 vehicles a day, so the roadblock will cause a major disruption in trade and tourism. The closest detour is a bridge about a quarter mile east of I-5, which is mostly used by local traffic between Mount Vernon and Burlington. Officials are also recommending detours using state Routes 20 and 9 that add dozens of miles to a trip. Hopeful: Crowds gathered on the river bank as the rescue crews bring survivors out of the water . Viewing the scene: Crowds gathered on the top of the bridge as they tried to assess the damage . Location: The bridge itself is in a rather remote area between the towns of Burlington and Mount Vernon but the interstate itself is a major thoroughfare that connects Seattle to Canada . A Federal Highway Administration database lists the bridge that . collapsed as 'functionally obsolete' - a category meaning that the . design is outdated, such as having narrow shoulders and low clearance . underneath. But it was not classified as structurally deficient. The 1,112-foot-long bridge, with two lanes in each direction, has four . spans, or sections, over the water supported by piers. It's a steel . truss bridge, meaning it has a boxy steel frame. The northernmost span is the one that collapsed. The mishap was reminiscent of the August 2007 collapse of an I-35W . bridge in Minneapolis that killed 13 people and injured another 145 when . it buckled and fell into the Mississippi River during rush-hour. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the Minneapolis . bridge failed because steel gusset plates that connected the . structure's beams and girders were too thin.","Four lanes of I-5 fell into the Skagit River in Washington State between the towns of Burlington and Mount Vernon .

A one-word insult helped provoke the TV punch that landed media tycoon Alexander Lebedev in the dock, a court was told yesterday. It was delivered in the ‘green room’ before the talk show, when property mogul Sergei Polonsky is said to have called Lebedev a ‘mudak’, a Russian word which translates as ‘d***head’. Lebedev, whose family control the Independent titles and the London Evening Standard, faces up to five years jail if he is found to have punched the businessman because of ‘political hatred’. Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev, pictured left arriving at a court in Moscow, is on trial for allegedly punching businessman Sergei Polonsky, pictured right, because of political hatred .

Gazeta’s investigations highlighting corruption in high places. Russian journalist Olga Romanova, a . witness, pleaded with the court not to have to repeat the ‘rude’ word . allegedly uttered by Polonsky, but was ordered to do so. She said that as the show got under  way, shortly before the punch, Polonsky berated Ledebev for several minutes off microphone. ‘He behaved in a provocative way, but it is his style, he is always provocative,’ she said. Emotions: A witness in the audience during the show told the court that Mr Polonsky had been acting 'emotionally' before Mr Lebedev hit him . Viral: Footage of the punch, when Polonsky fell backwards and was knocked off his chair, went viral on the internet . ‘Polonsky was saying something to Lebedev all the time, two or three minutes long, talking but not into the microphone. ‘I did not hear it, I was far enough away, but it was disturbing. I can’t remember Lebedev answering this.’ Soon afterwards, she saw Lebedev’s back as he hit Polonsky. Anton Krasovski, presenter of the . Russian talk show, did not confirm the attack by Lebedev, 53, was . motivated by ‘political hatred’, a key requirement under Russian law if . Levedev is to be sentenced to jail over the incident. ‘I did see Lebedev . hitting Polonsky, but I have no idea why he did it,’ he said. ‘I can’t remember what Polonsky . actually said, but I watched it again and I remember there was a series . of provocative remarks by this extravagant person Polonsky.’ Screen . clash: Russian banker and media magnate Alexander Lebedev (pictured) argues that the incident involving Sergei Polonsky was not politically motivated . Charge: . During the televised show Sergei Polonsky, a Russian businessman, pictured, allegedly called Lebedev a 'mudak', which translates as 'd***head' Krasovski insisted: ‘It was not political. I don’t think so.’ Polonsky has not appeared at the trial in Moscow. His lawyers said he is in Cambodia – . where he was bailed from detention pending an investigation into claims . he assaulted and kidnapped local sailors at knifepoint – though there . are other claims he is in Israel. Lebedev’s legal team demanded the court be told where he is and why he can’t attend proceedings. After yesterday’s hearing, Lebedev . said that in 2006, when he was a Russian MP, he signed a request for an . official investigation into a Polonsky construction project. ‘It was just my duty but Polonsky probably took it personally and cannot forgive me,’ he said. ‘We had never met before seeing each other in the dressing room before the show. ‘He was provocative and rude but nobody saw it.

The British boss of Ford in Europe has launched a blistering attack against EU red tape which he says doubles the cost of building a car by adding nearly £6,000 to the bill. Stephen Odell, executive vice president of Ford Motor Company and president of Ford Europe, Middle East and Africa, made his remarks at ‘the Future of Manufacturing’ summit held at the Cranfield Business School, in Bedford. He said: ‘EU regulations add . approximately £6,000 to the cost of an average car. 'They make it approximately twice as expensive as it otherwise would be. Stephen Odell, the British boss of Ford in Europe, has launched an attack against EU red tape . 'They should . not be implemented without proper consideration of their implications . for the competitiveness of European manufacturers.’ Highlighting the British government's emphasis on free trade during its G8 presidency, Mr Odell warned that existing ‘unbalanced’ free trade agreements with South Korea had exacerbated problems of surplus capacity in Europe and had failed to reduce trade imbalances. If the same mistakes are made with a planned free-trade agreement with Japan, a European manufacturing recovery could be threatened still further. Mr Odell said: ‘In the three year period from July 2009 to June 2012, South Korea imported 207,000 vehicles from Europe. 'In the same period, Europe imported nearly a million vehicles from South Korea. That’s nearly five times as many. Stephen Odell said EU red tape adds approximately £6,000 to the cost of an average car . ‘This particular playing field sometimes feels as if it’s been built on the side of a mountain. The free trade agreement with South Korea does not and, on account of its lack of balance, cannot work in its current form.’ Using a cricketing metaphor to describe the actions of the EU and UK governments he said: ‘We are at the crease with our bats broken in advance by the administrators of our own cricket club. We are at risk of serious injury and it is time to suspend play.’ He said: 'When G8 leaders gather in Northern Ireland next month, free trade will be high on the agenda – particularly between the EU and the US and potentially between Europe and Japan. ‘We believe in free trade because we believe in economic growth. But to work, free trade agreements must be fair and properly implemented. And sadly, this is not always the case.’ He said that five weeks ago, negotiations began on another free trade agreement, this time between the European Union and Japan: 'Once bitten, twice shy. We are extremely concerned about the possible outcome.’ He said: 'The last thing we need is for Japan to exacerbate surplus capacity in Europe by flooding the market with products that are surplus to demand. 'This is surplus capacity from a market protected through non-tariff barriers and a managed exchange rate. ‘So, we ask the European Commission to respect its commitment to suspend negotiations if Japan does not deliver on its promise to dismantle non-tariff barriers.’","Stephen Odell spoke at a manufacturing summit this week .

Jo Swinson says parents that praise their children's looks may actually be damaging their self esteem as it makes them conscious of their looks in later life . Parents who can't help but tell their children they are beautiful may actually be harming their confidence, according to women's minister Jo Swinson. The senior Lib Dem warned mothers and fathers who repeatedly praise the looks of their child could be fuelling insecurities about their looks. Ms Swinson says seemingly innocuous comments about the hair, looks or outfit of one of their children could be reinforcing the negative message that looks are the most important thing in life. The 33-year-old, who does not have any children, said mothers should also be wary of moaning or boasting about their looks in front of their children for the same reason. Instead, Ms Swinson MP for East Dunbartonshire, said parents should praise their children's intelligence and other positive attributes to help them succeed in life. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, the Liberal Democrat said: 'I know as an aunt, you fall into the trap of turning to your neice and saying, ""you look beautiful"" - because of course all children do look beautiful - but if the message they get is that is what is important and that is what gets the most praise, then that's necessarily the most positive message you want them to hear.' She added that instead praising them for skills like an ability to do a jigsaw, or positively commenting on their inquisitive nature was a healthier way to bolster their self-esteem. Instead of praising looks, Ms Swinson says parents should compliment their child when they show curiosity or intelligence . She was speaking ahead of the launch of the Government's campaign on body confidence. She quoted statistics that show a quarter of all children aged 10 to 15 are unahppy about their appearance, while more than 70 per cent of girls feel that there is too much of a focus on the attractiveness of female celebrities.' She added: 'It's not like saying looks don't matter at all. If you're going for an interview, you will dress smartly and look the part, that is absolutely fine, but its just the level to which this becomes the ultimate focus of everything.' She added that when children see their parents bemoaning their weight or asking their children's opinion on their appearance it teaches them that appearance is disproportionately  important .","Lib Dem Jo Swinson says children may focus on looks if they are forever told how beautiful they are .

A nurse has pleaded guilty to murdering 11 elderly people by setting fire to the Sydney nursing home where he worked. Roger Dean also pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to another eight residents injured by the blaze in 2011. The 37-year-old registered nurse was on duty when he set the fire and later appeared on television describing his efforts to rescue trapped people at the nursing home in the suburb of Quakers Hill. He made his pleas in New South Wales state Supreme Court on Monday. His sentencing hearing starts on Thursday. He potentially faces life imprisonment. Police had questioned him at the home hours before the blaze over theft allegations. He has already pleaded guilty to stealing prescription drugs from the home. After the fire, Dean told journalists he had braved the smoke to rescue those trapped inside as the home's 88 residents were evacuated. He said: 'I just quickly did what I could to get everyone out.' Detectives said two fires broke out in separate wings of the nursing home in the early hours. Dean had been helping police with their investigation before he was charged.

The paper reported that the staffer reportedly told officers that he claimed to know where the video was and that the person who had it may have been murdered for what he knew. A still image obtained by Gawker.com and The Toronto Star - allegedly taken from the video -  purportedly shows Ford with two men. One of them is believed to be Smith, who was gunned down outside at Toronto nightclub last month. The report comes as Ford's press secretary George Christopoulos and deputy press secretary Isaac Ransom have stepped down amid the uproar. Additionally, chief of staff Mark Towhey was fired late last week, according to reports. Ford said on Sunday that the purported video of him smoking crack cocaine does not exist and vowed to seek re-election next year, and attacked the media as a 'bunch of maggots.' Pout: Vacated by his communications staffers and facing drug allegations, Ford has clearly seen better days . Rumors: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (right) said on a talk show hosted by his brother City Councillor Doug Ford that a video of him allegedly smoking crack cocaine does not exist . The mayor of Canada's largest city, speaking on the weekly radio show he hosts with his brother Doug Ford, a city council member, reiterated that the allegations are ridiculous, but he still has not said whether he has ever used crack. The video has not been released publicly and its authenticity has not been verified. Reports on Gawker and in the Toronto Star claimed it was taken by men who said they had sold the drug to Ford. Holding firm: Ford, pictured during a press conference on Monday, says that the purported video of him smoking crack cocaine does not exist . The Star reported that two . journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a . chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe. The Star said it did not obtain the video or pay to watch it. Gawker and the Star have said the video was shown to them by a drug dealer who had been trying to sell it for a six-figure sum. Today, Gawker successfully raised more than $200,000 in its 'Crackstarter' campaign to purchase the video. When asked by a caller to the show if it was him in the video, Ford responded: 'Number one: There's no video, so that's all I can say. You can't comment on something that doesn't exist.' Ford called the allegations false and said good journalists are 'few and far between'. 'A bunch of maggots,"" Ford said, quickly adding that he shouldn't have said that. In a press conference today, he apologized for the remark. Ford has refused to take questions from the media for more than a week. On Friday, he read a statement to reporters in which he denied using or being addicted to crack cocaine, but declined to take any questions. The explanation has not been enough for Ford's critics, who have questioned whether the mayor has told the whole truth. Some have called on him to step down, but Ford vowed on Sunday to seek re-election next year. 'I'll be the first putting my name on that ballot,' he said. Fundraising: On Monday, Gawker successfully raised more than $200,000 in its 'Crackstarter' campaign to purchase the video . Doug Ford is also facing drug allegations after another leading Canadian newspaper published Saturday the results of what it called a lengthy investigation into the Ford family's past that revealed 'a portrait of a family once deeply immersed in the illegal drug scene'. The Globe and Mail, citing anonymous sources who were involved in the drug trade, alleged that the mayor's older brother sold hashish for several years in the 1980s in the Toronto suburb of Etobicoke, where the family grew up. Doug Ford, 48, is an influential adviser to the mayor. 'I was not a dealer of hashish in the 1980s,' Doug Ford said on Sunday's radio show. On Saturday, in an interview with the cable TV news network, CP24, Doug Ford also denied the allegations, accusing the Globe and Mail of engaging in 'irresponsible journalism' and trying 'to ruin our family.' Standing tall: Ford, with his wife, second left, and two friends, said he will be the first to put his name on a ballot for re-election . The mayor has been embroiled in almost weekly controversies about his behavior since being elected in 2010, but these are the most serious allegations he has yet faced. The Toronto Star reported earlier this year that the mayor was asked to leave a gala fundraiser for wounded Canadian soldiers because he appeared intoxicated. During his campaign for mayor, Rob Ford vehemently denied a 1999 arrest for marijuana possession in Florida, but later acknowledged it was true after he was presented with evidence. He pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and failing to give a breath sample to police. While in office, he has been accused of flouting conflict of interest rules and making obscene gestures at residents from his car. The controversy has drawn comparisons to the 1990 arrest of then-Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room during an FBI sting operation. Barry served six months in federal prison on a misdemeanor drug possession conviction but later won a fourth term as mayor in 1994.","Report says top official was interviewed by police in their investigation of a recent murder .

The childhood friend of one of the Woolwich suspects who was dramatically arrested at the  BBC has disguised his identity and is linked to a banned extremist group, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. During an interview for Newsnight at New Broadcasting House in central London on Friday night Abu Nusaybah sensationally claimed that MI5 had tried to recruit suspect Michael Adebolajo. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Abu Nusaybah’s real name is Ibrahim Hassan, 31, a former prominent member of  Al-Muhajiroun, the group banned in 2005 after radicalising a wave of British Muslims including  Adebolajo. Islamist group: Ibrahaim Hassan, far right, pictured with Anjem Choudary and convert Richard Dart . As BBC reporter Richard Watson interviewed Hassan, five detectives from the Metropolitan Police counter terrorism command arrived at the studio’s glass door. After challenging the officers, a receptionist entered the studio and announced: ‘I’m sorry but they want to arrest someone. Last night, an unnamed friend of Hassan, who was present during the Newsnight interview, claimed the police intervention was intended to stop Hassan making claims about MI5’s alleged involvement with Adebolajo. He said: ‘As we were wrapping up we saw policemen standing by the glass door. I looked at Richard and he wasn’t his normal self. His face was red and he looked stressed. I heard the receptionist asking the police what they were doing and then she came in.’ The arrest came just hours after Hassan had used Twitter, under the name Abu Nusaybah, to accuse MI5 of trying to  recruit Adebolajo as an agent  six months ago. The unnamed friend said the BBC had read the tweets and contacted Hassan, who lives in Walthamstow, East London, to arrange an interview. Three hours later, police officers arrived at the BBC to make the arrest. Questions are now being asked about whether there was an attempt to stop the interview going out and silence Hassan. Civil rights experts said the timing of the arrest was particularly worrying. Professor Anthony Glees, director of Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, said: ‘This arrest is very disturbing. How did the police know he would be at the BBC? Who told them? ‘It looks like MI5 wanted information that the BBC had. But it’s not for the BBC to do MI5’s investigating. ‘There should be a full inquiry and someone needs to get a  grip of it.’ Describing the events in detail the friend said: ‘The BBC sent a car for us at 7.45pm near my house in East London. At 8.15 we arrived at the BBC and met Richard (Watson) in reception. ‘We talked with Richard about the interview and what questions he would ask because we wanted it pre-planned so we knew what questions were asked. We then went to a side studio (near the reception) where the interview took place with Watson.’ Rant: A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, . brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the . killing. It was claimed last night that MI5 offered Adebolajo a job six . months ago . Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand at the scene where Lee Rigby was stabbed to death . Adebolajo, right, is pictured at an English Defence League march in 2009 . He described how officers made the arrest an hour before the interview was broadcast. ‘It was very shocking. One of them asked me for his (Nusaybah’s) phone which I had with me. ‘I refused but they said if I didn’t give it to them they would arrest me and take everything. Then they ushered him out of the back of the building. ‘When the programme was broadcast the BBC had edited a lot of it and it didn’t include lots of claims he made, particularly that MI5 had known that he was being tortured in Kenya. ‘We were disappointed that the BBC had edited the programme like that so that full story didn’t come out.’ Last night, police sources denied that the arrest was connected in any way to the Newsnight broadcast or  that they had attempted  to stop the interview going out. Fallen hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, from Manchester, was described as 'cheeky and humorous' in tributes. He was executed by two suspected Islamic terrorists in Woolwich on Wednesday afternoon . A great character: Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave . A BBC spokesman said: ‘This interviewee had important background information  that sheds light on this  horrific event. ‘When we discovered it we  had a duty to share it with our viewers. And when we asked  him to appear and interviewed him, we were not aware he  was wanted for questioning  by the police. ‘He was arrested immediately on BBC premises after he left the interview.’ Hassan, who has three children and claims benefits, said that he has known Adebolajo since 2003. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I first converted to Islam, and  then he converted about six months later. ‘It was me who invited him to Islam, and then he turned to Islam. We went to Islamic talks all over East London.’ Hassan said that he and Adebolajo used to attend talks given by the firebrand preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad, who has been banned from re-entering the UK after he went to Lebanon for holiday in 2005. Bakri founded the extremist group Al-Muhajiroun in the mid-90s. It was banned first banned in 2005 by Tony Blair after the 7/7 attacks and then again in 2010. Hassan said that Bakri was a major influence on Adebolajo at the time.","Abu Nusaybah claimed that MI5 tried to recruit suspect Michael Adebolajo .

A 20-year-old man has been stabbed to death on a Luton estate where earlier this month police . were forced to begin armed patrols in a bid to clamp down on gang shootings. The victim, who has been named by . residents as Jordan McGuire, was fatally injured in the terraced home . he shares with his mother on the troubled Marsh Farm estate, which has now seen three murders and 11 shootings since September. An ambulance crew and armed police rushed to Thrales Close at around 8.15pm on Sunday where he was was found bleeding heavily. Troubles: Officers stand around a police cordon on Luton's Marsh Farm . where a 20-year-old man has become the latest victim in a spate of gang . killings . His mother Julie and his sister, who . lives locally, looked on as paramedics tended to Jordan. He was taken to . the Luton and Dunstable hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly . after his admission. Detectives said they were keeping an . open mind about the motive for the murder, but residents believe it is . the latest attack in the gang war between youths from the Marsh Farm and . Lewsey Farm Estates in Luton. Three people have been murdered since September and there have been 11 shootings since the beginning of the year. Victim: The youth - who has been named by residents as Jordan McGuire - was fatally injured in the terraced home he shares with his mother . Armed police began patrolling around the Marsh Farm estate earlier this month in response to a spate of gang shootings . Response: An ambulance crew and armed police rushed to Thrales Close at around 8.15pm on Sunday where Jordan was found bleeding heavily . DCI Stephen Collin, of the Beds, Herts and Cambridgeshire Major Crime Unit, is appealing for information. He said: 'There are three key persons of interest we are seeking in the inquiry. They have been caught on CCTV. They . are a black male on a bike, a black male with a dog and white female, . probably a teenager with red dyed hair in a pony tail. It is really important that they come forward or people on Marsh Farm provide information on who they are. 'The victim would have known who his attacker or attackers were. It was a targeted attack.' A post mortem is to be carried out later today. A boy walks past an armed officer as police patrol the Marsh Farm Estate after a spate of shootings . Reassurance: Bedfordshire Police say the patrols will be in place 'for the foreseeable future' to ensure local people feel safe and to prevent further crime . Yesterday the area around the 3 bed . terraced house was taped off as forensic officers examined the scene. The car park at the back of the house, which was strewn with beer and . spirit bottles, was also cordoned off. Resident Chris Martin, 58, said: . 'Jordan was a nice lad who got on well with people. When it happened all . his mates went up to the hospital. His mum and his sister were out . there as the ambulance crews treated him. 'From what I understand he was . stabbed in the side by someone who just walked past. I have no idea what . it was about. There has been all this trouble between a gang on the . estate and Lewsey Farm.' Show of force: A police officer armed with an assault rifle and a baton gun on the estate in Luton . Jordan's father, who is believed to . live in Stevenage, was at the scene after the killing. Family liaison . officers from the police were supporting the family. Another local said: 'The ambulance . crew were working on him at the back of the house and then he was taken . to hospital. We heard he had been stabbed in the neck.' On May 11 a 16 year old was shot in the back in the neighbouring Thricknells Close. Police said he may never walk again. In the past year there has been . violence in Luton involving rival gangs from the Marsh Farm and Lewsey . Farm Estates. Earlier this month Kyle Beckford, 22, a member of the . Marsh Farm gang, was jailed for a minimum of 24 years from the murder of . Delaney Brown, 19, who was run over while on a push bike last . September. Delaney was in the Lewsey Farm gang. On 12 April Delaney's uncle Paul Foster, 46, who was known as Big Shyne, was shot dead outside a house in Brunel Road. This weekend a man from Luton was . charged with attempted murder and possessing a gun after shots were . fired at a BMW by a man riding a motorbike in Culverhouse Road on 5 May . after a peace rally in the town. Khadeem Newell, 22, of Jasmine Road, . Luton, appeared before magistrates and was remanded in custody. A woman who lives nearby said: 'I am 75 years old. I live here on my own. It is frightening. There is too much of it going on.' Another man said: 'This is a disease . spreading across the estate. It is a drug turf war. They are silly young . lads with nothing to do. It is the Marsh Farm and Lewsey Farm gangs. They have got to stop messing around with knives and guns.' In recent weeks armed officers . carrying Heckler and Koch G36C assault rifles with 5.56mm calibre . ammunition that can pierce body armour, have been seen on patrol. The high-powered weapons were introduced in response to . the threat of a ‘marauding’ terror attack, like the one in Mumbai . involving a gang of men with semi-automatic rifles. Bedfordshire Police have also invoked . Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, allowing . them to stop and search without suspicion.","20-year-old man was stabbed to death on the Marsh Farm Estate .

Photographs showing the workers of the Leys Malleable Castings Company in Derby were discovered by researchers in the city's Local Studies Library. Leys, which made castings for cars, opened in Derby in 1874 and became the largest malleable iron foundry in Europe. This photo from 1928 shows Derby women at work in the sand core shop. They created the moulds for castings by mixing sand with oil and baking it . Men in a workshop at the company grinded down the metal work before it was sent out to customers . The picture collection, including this one from the early 1930s, were sat in a box at Derby's Local Studies Library . The scale of the site meant it had its own railway line to bring in raw materials and dispatch the company's products to customers around the world. Some male workers also served as the company fire brigade. They were required to live near the factory and had alarms in their homes in case of an emergency call-out.

Victim: Clifford Clarke, 79, died in his back garden in Clubmoor, Liverpool, on Saturday night after he was mauled by a dog . A grandmother claims she called dog wardens to deal with two crazed dogs just an hour before one mauled a pensioner to death but was told they were 'too busy' to help. Worried Selina Hagan said she called Liverpool City council after the snarling animals tried to get into her conservatory where she was looking after her 18-month-old grandchild. But she was told they were too busy and she would have to wait four hours before they could come out. Tragically around an hour later one of the dogs got into the garden of 79-year-old Clifford Clarke where it savaged the pensioner to death. Mr Clarke had slightly burnt the lamb shank he was cooking for his evening meal so he opened his back door. The smell of the food is believed to have attracted the two large dogs. Mrs Hagan, 59, of Clubmoor, Liverpool, told the Daily Mirror: 'I rang the wardens over an hour before it happened at 7.29pm on Saturday, telling them they were going mad trying to get into our conservatory. 'My two grandchildren were here, one is just 18 months old. They weren't interested. We were told it would be four hours until they arrived. 'I called again an hour later to say it was too late - they'd got a man. 'If the dog wardens had listened to what we were saying, Cliff's life could have been saved.'

The New York Police Department bomb squad shut down the Brooklyn Bridge for two hours on Memorial Day after driver reported a suspicious SUV without a license plate abandoned midway across the span. After a heavily-armored bomb technician tore through the vehicle and a bomb-sniffing dog gave it a once-over, the NYPD offered the all-clear and re-opened the key East River crossing to traffic about 7pm on Monday. The suspicious Dodge Durango was parked in a Manhattan-bound lane of the iconic bridge. Police shut down all traffic - both pedestrians and cars - while they ensured that it did not contain explosives. See video below . Searching: A heavily-armored member of the NYPD bomb squad searched the SUV abandoned on the Brooklyn Bridge on Monday . Abandoned: The Dodge Durango SUV had no license plate. It was abandoned in a Manhattan-bound lane, about midway across the span . Icon: The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most recognizable landmarks in New York City. It is also a key East River crossing for more than 120,000 vehicles a day . In 2010, an al-Qaeda-trained Pakistani-American parked an SUV full of explosives in Times Square and left. Lucky, the bombs failed to detonate, but the NYPD has been on alert for possible car bombs ever since. The only threat that Monday's . abandoned SUV posed, though, was snarled holiday traffic in lower . Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn. Motorists called 911 to report the suspicious SUV about 5.15pm on Monday. Police quickly shut down the entire bridge, clogging holiday traffic in both downtown Brooklyn and downtown Manhattan. Several NYPD bomb squad vehicles slowly passed by the car, possibly scanning it for explosives. Then, a heavily-armored bomb technician searched the vehicle. After his inspection, he walked back to waiting bomb squad units and took off his helmet. Brave: A lone bomb disposal officer was dispatched to inspect the SUV. After several minutes of tearing out floor mats and padding, he found nothing dangerous in the vehicle . On guard: The NYPD has been on the lookout for possible car bombs since the failed bombing attempt of Times Square in 2010 . Police helicopters and TV news aircraft circled the bridge as helpless pedestrians and motorists waited to cross the East River . Moments later, an NYPD officer, who was not wearing armor, approached the vehicle with a bomb-sniffing dog. After the dog inspected the vehicle, that officer returned to the cadre of NYPD trucks parked a few hundred feet away. Moments later, the NYPD said the vehicle posed no threat. On May 1, 2010, a Pakistani-born American named Faisal Shahzad parked a Nissan Pathfinder SUV loaded with explosives in Times Square. However, the improvised car bomb failed to detonate. The VIN on the dashboard, a unique identification number for the vehicle, had been removed. Just three days later, the RFK Bridge in Manhattan had to be evacuated after a driver abandoned a U-Haul rental truck near the toll plaza. That vehicle was found to have nothing suspicious inside. However, that incident snarled New York City traffic for hours, as well.","Bridge closed for two hours on memorial day after Dodge Durango with no license plate is discovered abandoned midway across the span .

Charities have demanded urgent action to prevent access to illegal and ‘disgusting’ child pornography via Google and other web browsers. A coalition of organisations is arguing for the introduction of blocking software and on-screen warnings to deny internet users access to the material. The group includes the NSPCC, Barnado’s, Action for Children, BAAF, Beat Bullying, Children England, Children’s Society, ECPAT UK, Kidscape, and Stop It Now. A coalition of charities has demanded urgent action from the likes of Google to prevent access to child pornography . Their call follows revelations in the Daily Mail on Saturday about the ease of finding video and photos of the sexual exploitation of young girls. The investigation by Mail columnist Amanda Platell was prompted by the case of Stuart Hazell, killer of 12-year-old Tia Sharp, whose murderous fantasies were fuelled by online child pornography. But the group, the UK Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, questioned if firms like Google have the will to take action. John Carr, government adviser on internet safety and secretary of the charity coalition, said the Mail was right to highlight the problem. ‘Google can do more and should do more,’ he said. ‘For example, whenever someone puts in a search that clearly indicates they are looking for child pornographic material, Google could flash up a warning. ‘It could say “You are trying to reach child pornographic material. This is illegal and if you persist there is a chance of arrest and prosecution”.’ Google’s web browser has three levels of filtering – ‘unfiltered’, ‘moderate’ and ‘safe’. The murderous fantasies of Stuart Hazell killer of Tia Sharp, 12,  were fuelled by online child pornography . The default is moderate, which does not block hardcore porn. ‘It would be very easy for Google and others to have “safe search” as the default,’ Mr Carr said. It is illegal to search for child pornography and anyone who finds suspect images is advised to report them to the Internet Watch Foundation so they can be blocked. Miss Platell’s article revealed how easy it is to find images of what appeared to be child sexual exploitation. All of the details have been passed to the Metropolitan Police. Mr Carr said: ‘This is a major public policy challenge. Amanda Platell is dead right in saying there needs to be some sort of control on Google’s searches.’ Last night Google said: ‘We take this issue extremely seriously. We are members and joint funders of the Internet Watch Foundation. When we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it we respond quickly to remove and report it.’ My journey into the hell .","Charities want blocking software and on-screen warnings to deny access .

Despite big budget performances and desirable stars currently lighting up the Great White Way, ticket sales have slumped for the second-straight year. The decline was blamed mainly on a feeble fall season and Superstorm Sandy, whichforced all 40 Broadway theaters to shutter for three days. Decline: Despite big budget performances and desirable stars currently lighting up Broadway, ticket sales have slumped for the second-straight year . When they reopened, all shows reported massive losses. One of the hardest hurt was the Matthew Broderick musical Nice Work If You Can Get It, which lost $538,853. Wicked lost $490,996. Crain's New York reported that attendance at Broadway shows plummeted 6 per cent (11.3 million) from this time in 2012. Last year, a 2 per cent dip in showgoers was reported. The May-to-May Broadway year began with shows that were widely seen as flops - like Chaplin and David Mamet's The Anarchist - which shuttered before the year was over.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:02 EST, 22 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:36 EST, 22 May 2013 . David Cameron today said he wanted to help people who ‘work hard’. But politicians again face charges of laziness as they begin another break less than a fortnight since their last Commons recess. It means that in the first 151 days of 2013, the Commons will have been convened just 67 times. Rare sight: Since the start of the year the Commons has sat for fewer than half of the days . The Parliamentary calendar for the first half of the year reveals how few times Commons has sat (shown in green) To add to the sense of public outrage, it emerged only this week that MPs could be in line for a £20,000 pay rise. They could take home up to £80,000 a year – more than three times the national average – under new recommendations. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which reports next month, has been looking at an increase of between £10,000 and £20,000. But the lower figure is considered more likely to try and minimise the public backlash, which would take MPs' pay, currently £65,738, up to £75,000. Mr Cameron has faced repeated criticism from Labour for missing several Prime Minister’s Questions since the start of the year. During the space of 12 weeks he will face MPs just twice. In 2012-13 the Commons sat just 145 times, the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election. Some in Westminster predict it could be even lower this year. MPs begin their Whitsun recess today and are not due back in Westminster until June 3. It means they have 12 days off, when even most schoolchildren only have a week. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Any MP worth their salt will be hard at work in their constituency during this latest recess. 'However, another week and a half away from Westminster means another week and a half during which ministers will get away without being scrutinised in Parliament by the very people we elect there to hold them to account. 'Week in, week out, we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions, which result in Bills being passed by MPs without having been subject to detailed scrutiny. 'This is bad for democracy and MPs need to cut down on these recesses in order to allow for more time to be spent in the Commons properly debating new laws and holding the Government to account.' Labour accused the government of not having enough policies to sustain debates. SHadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said: ‘David Cameron is scared of scrutiny and the government has run out of ideas. 'It is no wonder we keep going in to recess and that the Prime Minister has only shown up for Prime Minister’s Questions once in the last nine weeks.' In 2012-13 the Commons sat just 145 times, one of the lowest figures outside a general election year . Since January, MPs have only had a full five-day week in Westminster six times. They . usually spend Monday to Thursday in Parliament and then have Friday as a . ‘constituency day’ to attend local events and meet voters. The . Commons had a week off in February for half term. It then broke up for . 19 days, returning once when Parliament was recalled for tributes to . Baroness Thatcher. David Cameron insisted the government was focusing on repairing the economy . The . Commons then sat for just eight days before breaking again on April 25, . this time for prorogation to prepare for the Queen’s Speech on May 8. It meant a bonus 12 days off, before returning for the pomp and ceremony of the State Opening of Parliament. Despite setting out more than a dozen . major bills, including legislation on reforming social care and . pensions, there appears to be no urgency to start debating the laws. Mr Cameron today insisted he was focusing on the issues which matter to the public. 'People want a country which is fair, which is on the side of people who work hard and do the right thing,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'That’s got to apply to our immigration system, its got to apply to our welfare system, it’s got to apply to our schools. That is what we must focus on.' The Commons has been convened just eight times since the Queen’s Speech, before breaking up for the latest recess which will last until June 3. The log jam of holidays is caused by the coalition’s decision to move the Queen’s Speech from the autumn – when the prorogation served as a mini half-term break. Ministers argue that the Commons is sitting more than in the past, because it now routinely returns for two weeks in September. The summer recess this year last from July 8 to October 8. Ahead of the last recess Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs Westminster’s spending watchdog, warned the public think politicians are lazy and provide poor value for money. 'We are living through the worst economic crisis in modern times. MPs have a lot to do and yet we are spending much of our time in recess,’ she said. 'Members of the public would be forgiven for thinking that it is MPs who are lazy and that it is Parliament that is failing to provide good value for money. 'We are not spending enough time in Westminster, and this creates a democratic vacuum.'","MPs begin 12-day Whitsun recess - longer than the school half term break .

During a break in the filming of Brand X, his U.S. TV chat show that is filmed in London but not shown in Britain, Brand, 37, said the two men were paedophiles during a monologue about disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Saville and Operation Yewtree, the police investigation into historical child abuse in the world of showbusiness. The Daily Star reported he told the stunned crowd: 'And you've got the lesser ones... the underlings. There's ______.' Russel Brand, pictured arriving for filming of Brand X at the Duchess Theatre on March 14, has alleged that two TV stars are paedophiles . He added: 'And some say old ______ is playing around.' Neither of the men mentioned have ever been convicted of a sex offence. He also told the 200 guests at the Duchess Theatre in Covent Garden that the investigation made the controversy surrounding the call he made to actor Andrew Sachs joking about sleeping with his granddaughter, egged on by TV star Jonathan Ross, not quite as controversial. Speaking of the incident, widely known as Sachsgate, he said: 'It puts the whole Sachsgate thing into perspective doesn't it? '""I f***** your adult granddaughter"". Not quite the same, is it?' A member of the audience said the comedian and movie actor made the audience uncomfortable when he made the claims. He said: 'No-one had heard these stars linked to the Savile case. They didn't have a clue until then.' Controversial: Russell Brand in West Hollywood. He said Sachsgate paled in significance to the current controversy over alleged sexual abuse . The newspaper contacted the agents of the two men named for comment, one said they had not heard of the incident and had no comment. The other was not available. Brand and Jonathan Ross caused a national scandal in 2008 when they left smutty messages on veteran actor Andrews Sachs's answerphone during a pre-recorded Radio 2 show. Ross said that Brand had sex with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie. Break-up: Katy Perry and Russell Brand married in 2010 but are now divorced . It led to the departure of the Radio 2 station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. The two apologised for their actions. Brand married pop star Katy Perry in 2010 but filed for divorce after just 14 months of marriage in December 2011, citing 'irreconcilable differences.' Brand said in a statement at the time: 'Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always adore her and I know we'll remain friends.'

Friday evening and Kings Cross station was bedlam at the start of the Bank Holiday weekend — but it was a happy kind of bedlam. The working week was over and expectations were riding high as families, students, elderly couples, children of all ages and hundreds of tourists waited to learn from which platform the 7pm London to  Edinburgh train would leave. Even the weather forecast was half-decent. We were a group of four and had reserved seats in carriage C several weeks in advance. We paid £125 each for a return ticket. Nearly eight hours later, on a trip that should have taken three hours and 40 minutes, we had still not reached our final destination — though we had long reached the end of our tether. Friday evening and Kings Cross station was bedlam at the start of the Bank Holiday weekend ¿ but it was a happy kind of bedlam . It was a journey that tested many of our fellow passengers to the limit; a frightening experience for some and confirmation that in so many areas of life Britain is nothing more than a Third World country run by overpaid incompetents accountable to no one. Hundreds of us put up with it because, as a nation, we are still good in adversity. Perhaps the increasingly overused wartime slogan, Keep Calm And Carry On, has subliminally persuaded us that the shambles of day-to-day living in this country is a perfectly normal state of affairs and will never change. So why fight it? But many of us who were stranded on the Nightmare Express might beg to differ. As one pensioner said to me at one point as the lights went out and the temperature rose higher and higher in our hermetically sealed carriage: ‘You can bet your life that if a member of the Cabinet were on this train, heads would roll. As it is, we’ll be fobbed off with excuses and the promise of a refund — then the same thing will happen all over again in a few weeks’ time. When we boarded our train, it did . dawn on me that it was dangerously overcrowded. One of the guards on the . platform practically pushed passengers on to the train, shouting: ‘Move . right down the corridors, we need to get this train off.’ People did as . they were told, taking their cases with them because there was no room . in the racks near the doors. Every inch of space was occupied. It . took us 40 minutes just to get to our seats, and yet the hapless ‘train . manager’ still had the audacity to ask passengers to ‘keep the aisles . clear for your safety and comfort’. He never dared move through the train to inspect tickets. He would have been lynched a hundred times over if he had. Every inch of space was occupied and took 40 minutes for passengers to get to their seats . Apart . from the general sense that we were all jammed into a giant sardine can . hurtling through the countryside, the journey progressed without . incident for the first 30 minutes. Then, . shortly before Newark in the East Midlands, the disembodied voice . announced that there was a problem with a section of the northbound . track, and that our train was in a queue to use the southbound track for . a mile or so — while, hopefully, going in a northern direction. While . we conjured visions of travelling all the way back to  London, those . with connections to meet at York resigned themselves to a very long . evening — or even an expensive night in a hotel. In the end, the to-ing . and fro-ing caused a delay of two hours, during which the passengers . around us became increasingly frazzled. We were seated near a group of South . Africans, who were preparing to run in the Edinburgh Marathon on behalf . of the cancer charity Macmillan Caring Locally. One . of them said he had never seen such an overcrowded train, and asked me . if there was a limit to the number of people allowed on board. Shortly . after Newcastle, the train slowed down and then, as we approached . Berwick-Upon-Tweed, which was our stop, it came to a complete halt. And remained stationary for a further 90 minutes. The gormless guard had been replaced . at Newcastle by a woman who said the train had stopped because someone . had pulled the passenger alarm. This . might have been true, but the real reason was that the train before us — . the 6pm London to Edinburgh service — had broken down in the station . and all its passengers had been told to disembark. Unsurprisingly, . late on a Friday, when most of us are desperate for the week to end, . tensions were running high, not least because the  station staff refused . to open up the First Class lounge so the elderly or frail could shelter . from the cold. The police were called. I know this because my wife, who had driven up from London earlier in the day, was waiting at Berwick for us to arrive. She . said the scene was more chaotic than anything she had ever seen in . India, whose railways are famous for their lunatic overcrowding. Our . guard finally told us about the broken-down train ahead of us. She said . that ‘fault finding’ was ‘ongoing’, but she had no idea when we might . be on the move. According to Mark Palmer passengers are treated like fodder and people are jam packed into overcrowded trains . As she finished her announcement, my daughter told me there was a distressed young man slumped on the floor by one of the doors. I went to see him and helped him to his feet. He explained that he suffered from . claustrophobia — then, suddenly, he began pounding the window of the . door with his fist and shouting: ‘I need fresh air NOW!’ I . told him to walk with me to the guard’s carriage at the other end of . the train, where I knew there was a small window that could be opened. On . the way, we passed crying babies, despairing old people with vacant . eyes, lavatories blocked in such a way that urine was seeping under the . doors, and everywhere there was anger and bewilderment. When we got to the buffet car, I asked for some water for the man I was accompanying. There was none. As we entered the First Class carriages, a member of the train staff had the gall to ask if we had First Class tickets. When we reached the little window at the back of the train, the young man gulped the air like a dog trapped in a baking car. Then . the lights went out again. This, the guard eventually explained, was . because it had been decided that our train would couple up to the broken . down one in  front and attempt to shunt it past Berwick station into a . siding, and reverse back into the station. Then . all those leaving the train could do so, and those waiting on the . platform at Berwick could continue their journey aboard our train — if . only they could fit on. Chaos: Angry passengers from the broken down train milling at Berwick. The platform clock tells the grim tale - It is 1.29am . Not once did any member of staff walk up and down the train to see if any passengers needed help. I came across a pregnant woman who told me she was expecting a baby in less than five weeks. She was struggling in the heat, and her mobile phone battery was dead. I told my daughter’s boyfriend to sit with her and offer her his phone. Increasingly, the place began to feel like a relief centre in a war zone. We pulled into Berwick at 2.40am. Those going on to Edinburgh eventually arrived at 3.39am, which means passengers who were on the 6pm from London had been travelling for nearly ten hours. Some Bank Holiday. ‘We are sorry for any inconvenience that may have been caused,’ was the last thing I heard our guard say, still reading from a script and still with an inflection that suggested she wanted us to feel sorry for the stress she was under. The next morning, I was reading about the Government’s plans for the High Speed Rail link from London to Manchester. If ever there was a case of running before you can walk, this is it. Our public transport is a disgrace. The East Coast Line, which is now State-owned and will remain so until at least 2017, is particularly dreadful. Passengers are treated like fodder; no one takes responsibility for abject failure and not even the ‘duty spokesman’ knew the answer to most of my questions. I wanted to know if there is ever a cut-off point on the number of people allowed to board a train. ‘I don’t have information about that,’ he said. Is there always water on board in case of emergencies? ‘There is sometimes in the guard’s carriage, I think.’ I told him I wanted the East Coast line to issue a statement. Which it did: ‘We would like to apologise to customers for the disruption on Friday evening.’ So that’s all right then.","Mark Palmer and reserved seats several weeks in advance paying £125 for the ticket .

Plumber Daniel Hickling caused a gas explosion which blew a house off its foundations and injured the owner and his wife . An 'incompetent' plumber caused a gas explosion which blew a house off its foundations and injured the wealthy owner and his wife after botching a simple job, a court was told. Daniel Hickling, 32, caused the blast described as like a 'jet aircraft crashing' after allegedly leaving a hole in piping which caused gas to leak into the luxury home of Martyn and Teresa Moody. Hickling cut off and capped the protruding pipe and then buried it under the floor during the conversion of a former kitchen into a dining room, Lincoln Crown Court heard. But he punctured the pipe and failed to carry out a straightforward test which would have located the leak, it was claimed. Hours . later the Moodys smelt gas and began searching their purpose built . mansion located in the pretty hamlet of Nettleton in the Lincolnshire . Wolds. While checking out . one of the rooms Mr Moody flicked on a cigarette lighter and the flame . ignited a massive explosion which rocked the house. The . blast had such force that the entire building moved an inch. The . windows and front door were blown out and the ground floor of the home . was severely damaged. Debris was thrown 100 yards away. Mr . Moody, 63, who had recently sold his own construction and electrical . business, spent two weeks in hospital after he suffered serious burns to . his hands, arms and scalp and had to undergo skin grafts. He has been . left scarred for life. His wife Teresa had burns to her legs and feet. She was released after two days in hospital. The large detached home, which the couple had built for themselves back in 1993, was so badly damaged that it had to be virtually completely rebuilt and it was a year before the couple were able to move back in. The rural property was supplied by an LPG tank in the back garden as it was not connected to the mains gas supply. The Moodys were left £100,000 out of pocket after they were subsequently found to be underinsured on their contents insurance and had to cover some of the loss themselves. The court was told that Hickling, who ran his own heating and plumbing business, was not qualified to carry out gas work. Teresa Moody (left) suffered burns to her legs and feet. She was released after two days in hospital. Martyn Moody (right) suffered serious burns to his hands, arms and scalp and had to undergo skin grafts . James Puzey, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive, said: 'He was incompetent to carry out this work and it was carried out incompetently. That led directly to an explosion which almost destroyed the property and caused serious injury to the householders.' Mr Puzey told the court Hickling did not reveal he was not a Gas Safe registered engineer when he agreed to carry out the work. 'Whilst they were watching television after dinner Mr and Mrs Moody smelt gas. They went out into the hall and then into the living room. Mr Moody relit the pilot light on the gas fire in the living room and then went into the dining room. Rebuilt: The large detached home, which the couple had built for themselves back in 1993, was so badly damaged that it had to be virtually completely rebuilt and it was a year before the couple were able to move back in . 'He tried to switch the lights on but unfortunately the lights in that room had been disconnected. Out of pure instinct he switched on his lighter and within moments there was an explosion. 'Mr Moody was disorientated. He ran outside then realised his wife wasn't with him. He then ran back inside and helped her out. 'He switched off the gas supply at the LPG tank and moved his two cars away from the property. Then, despite the injuries he suffered, he attempted to fight the fire with a garden hose before the fire brigade arrived and took over. Underinsured: The entrance to the home of Martyn and Teresa Moody . 'Both he and his wife suffered burns and were taken to hospital and the house was severely damaged. The windows in the front of the house had been blown out. The explosion caused the brickwork to be displaced.' A gas engineer called in by the HSE to examine the property found a 'significant leak' in pipe work which Hickling had buried under the floor. He said Hickling should have carried out a 'gas tightness test' before finishing the job which would have revealed the leak. Mr Moody, who had run his own construction business for 35 years specialising in hazardous locations such as oil refineries and gas plants, told the court: 'The plan was to conceal the pipe and turn the room into a dining room. We wanted rid of the pipe so we could get the decorators in and lay a new floor.' He said it was obvious that the pipe carried gas and he could not understand how Hickling thought they did not. 'I'm pretty sure I did tell him they were gas pipes.' Mr Moody said that it was only after he and his wife finished their meal that they smelt gas. 'We could smell gas in some places but not in others. I couldn't smell gas in the old kitchen where Daniel had worked but when I flicked the lighter on in there it blew up.' Hickling, 32, of Howsham, Lincolnshire, has pleaded guilty to three charges relating to the incident in July 2011 but disputes the prosecution case that he knew he was working on gas pipes. Hickling claimed he never put himself forward as a qualified gas engineer and did not know he was working on a gas pipe. He admits carrying out work to an inappropriate standard, carrying out work while not registered with the Gas Safety Register and carrying out gas fitting work he was not competent of doing so in breach of the 1998 Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulation. After hearing two days of evidence Recorder Helen Malcolm QC adjourned the case to a future date when she will give her ruling on the case.

This is the jaw-dropping moment the sun experiences one of its largest solar storms of the year as particles are blasted out at 1,200 miles per second. Solar flares, which are the greatest explosive events we experience, take place on the Sun when energy stored in twisted magnetic fields is suddenly released. The bursts of radiation aren't a threat to humans, although when powerful enough they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. Scroll down for video . On May 13, 2013, an X2.8-class flare erupted from the sun -- the strongest flare of 2013 to date. This image of the flare, shown in the upper left corner, was captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory . Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. However, when intense enough they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing, anywhere from minutes to hours. NASA has now released images of a series of violent explosions over the weekend - where it recorded the two largest flares of the year. They were classified as 'X Class' flares, which are the most intense recorded on the Richter-style scale. The first, on May 12, was a 1.7, followed by a 2.8 on May 13. The flares happened at the same time as a series of coronal mass ejections, which are solar phenomenons where billions of tons of particles are blasted into space. Research from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory showed the CMEs spewed particles out at a staggering 745 miles per second - the equivalent of 4.32 MILLION miles per hour. These spectacular events can affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground, but there was no threat as the ejection wasn't Earth directed. The sun erupted with an X1.7-class solar flare on May 12, 2013. This is a blend of two images of the flare from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory: One image shows light in the 171-angstrom wavelength, the other in 131 angstroms. However, staff working on the STEREO-B and Spitzer spacecraft have been warned the coronal mass ejections may brush past them, interfering with their operations. The Sun is currently coming to the end of its solar cycle, which is a period of low and high activity which repeats approximately every 11 years. There have been 16 X-Class eruptions this year. The largest on the current cycle was a staggering 6.9, which took place on August 9, 2011.","Flares are first to be classified as 'X Class', the most intense, of 2013 .

The 21-year-old was apparently . attempting to pass off the adult production as a leaked video of her and . porn actor James Deen engaged in a private documentation not intended for the public. Confession: Farrah Abraham admitted that the sex tape was a professional pornographic film, pictured in New York, in December . But the ruse was exposed when Farrah was spotted leaving porn company Vivid Entertainment holding hands with Deen, on Sunday. When asked about the video, Farrah's 27-year-old co-star was more than willing to admit that the whole thing was a scam. The professional porn director and actor told TMZ that the supposed sex tape was a 'setup'. Deen explained:'I . think what happened is that [the porn company was] going to pass it off . as a sex tape and somebody saw us coming out of a building together and . people asked me what's going on. 'So I was like, ""We're making a porno!""' Deen would not confirm whether or not the porn company was in fact Vivid Entertainment. The man in question: Porn star James Deen said the video was a 'setup', pictured at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, in November . Farrah, who has a four-year-old daughter . Sofia, appeared to feign surprise when asked about the existence of the tape on Monday, . muttering: 'I don't... exist... anything about that.' She later added: 'If I had my own personal stuff, that's my own personal thing.' But according to Deen: 'Everybody's trying to make it this story, but really [Farrah] wanted to make a sex tape.' Teen Mom: The 21-year-old with her four-year-old daughter Sofia in Dallas, Texas, in September 2011 . On Wednesday, Farrah finally conceded that the video was in fact scripted and shot by professionals. She told TMZ that she made the tape in an effort to immortalize her youthful physique. And the reality star still plans on selling the movie 'for [nothing] less than a couple million.' Since the con was initially exposed by Deen, the young mother said she now wants nothing to do with her co-star. She told TMZ: 'If my ex-boyfriend Derek [who died in a car accident in 2008] were alive, I would've rather it had been him with me.' And the scandal prone television star took to Twitter to defend herself, on Tuesday: 'I 'm going to ignore all the lies, all the hate, all the disrespectful people who want 2 take advantage of me, have fun making money off me.' Difficult relationship: Farrah with her mother Debra Danielson on MTV . But Farrah's mother Debra Danielsen does not believe her daughter would be involved in such a scandal. Debra told TMZ, on Tuesday: 'My daughter has never expressed interest in things like that,' referring to the sex tape. 'She was not brought up that way.' The 57-year-old added: 'We have religious beliefs.' While the grandmother may be a woman of faith, that did not stop her from allegedly choking and punching Farrah in the face. The New York Daily News . reported, in January 2010, that Debra was arrested under suspicion of . domestic abuse and assault against her then 18-year-old daughter. And on an episode of 16 & Pregnant, Debra was caught by MTV cameras hitting Farrah in the mouth during an argument in a car.",Farrah wishes the sex tape was with her deceased ex- boyfriend .

Quick-fire: The infra-red finger will allow employers to test workers for alcohol in just eight seconds . Millions of workers could face a daily alcohol test using a fingerprint scanner before they start their jobs. The new device which uses near infra-red light to measure blood alcohol content in the skin will give employers a result in just eight seconds, making it possible to test 450 employees per hour. The AlcoSense TruTouch scanner will be ideal for companies to test if employees still have any alcohol in their system from the night before. Public sector staff in local government and the NHS and workers in the transport and security industries are likely to be the first to be targeted. But unions have slammed the tactic as draconian and said employers should be trying to help employees with drinking problems not catching them out. AlcoDigital, the company which distributes the device, says that daily alcohol testing is the 'only true way of eliminating on-duty alcohol impairment'. Drug and alcohol testing at work has . become a hot topic in recent years, with companies claiming heavy . drinkers cost them millions in loss of productivity every year. The new scanner raises the prospect of companies being able to test workers at any time of the day. AlcoDigital . told MailOnline the practice is already commonplace in many workplaces . in the U.S. with one of their clients including the Coca-Cola factory. But director Suzannah Robin said it is important for employees to be consulted before a regular testing system is brought in. Crackdown: The easy-to-use scanners could be used to target the 'liquid lunch' culture . She added: 'One of the things that companies say to us is that if they bring in random testing then individuals feel like they are being targeted. 'But this way it involves everyone from the managing director down. It's difficult to say anyone is being fingered or singled out. 'From our point of view it's important that any alcohol testing policy that is brought in has the full support of employees.' But Unison General secretary Dave Prentis condemned the move as using 'a sledgehammer to crack a nut'. He told Metro: 'If workers have a problem with alcohol, their employers should not be relying on a gadget to entrap them but should be providing them with proper support.' A statement on the AlcoDigital website reads: 'Random screening can deter the casual user, but those with a serious alcohol problem are far less likely to change their inherent behaviour patterns. 'For . this reason this form of occasional screening can fail to have the . impact the company is looking for and alcohol use can continue to cost . the company, and thousands of others, billions of dollars a year. 'Testing every person, every day changes the underlying behaviour itself.'","AlcoSense TruTouch device gives a pass or fail result in just eight seconds .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:37 EST, 24 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:31 EST, 24 May 2013 . A South Korean newspaper has sparked outrage by claiming the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that killed 200,000 people in Japan during World War II was a 'divine punishment'. JoongAng Ilbo, which is one of the biggest South Korean daily newspapers, published the claims in a comment piece by one of its 'editorial writers' Kim Jin in both its English and Korean editions. The article suggested that Japan deserved both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki wartime atomic bombings in 1945 because of its lethal experiments on humans during the conflict. It read: 'God often borrows the hand of a human to punish the evil deeds of men.' Lethal: Smoke billows over the Japanese city of Nagasaki and Hiroshima after an atomic bomb was dropped on the city August 9, 1945, killing more than 200,000 people . The piece went on to claim that the two attacks were the retribution of god because of the country's infamous biological and chemical research facility, Unit 731, which carried out brutal experiments on humans. Tthe article read: 'These bombings were divine punishment and human retaliation at the same time. 'Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were . revenge for the Asians steamrolled by Japan’s militaristic nationalism, . especially the “Maruta,” the human beings used in experiment by a covert . biological warfare research team in China called Unit 731. Reduced to rubble: A survivor looks over the expanse of ruins left by the explosion of the atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, in Hiroshima, Japan . The United States attacked the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs during the final stages of World War II in 1945. The two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date. The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany surrendered on May 8, but the Pacific War continued. Together with the UK and the Republic of China, the United States called for the surrender of Japan, threatening the country with 'prompt and utter destruction'. The Japanese government ignored this ultimatum. American airmen then dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed with another over Nagasaki on August 9. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day. On August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies, signing the Instrument of Surrender on September 2, officially ending World War II. 'The cries (of the unit's victims) reached heaven and the bombs were dropped on Tokyo and the atomic . weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.' And in an ominous paragraph, the piece went on to threaten: 'God may feel that retaliation against Japan hasn't been complete.' Japan has reacted angrily to the article in the newspaper which has a circulation of 1.8million. Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, labelled the remarks as 'quite dishonourable', telling a press conference: 'We strongly protested to the staff of South Korea's Joongang Ilbo daily. 'Our country is the only atom-bombed nation. We will never forgive such remarks.' The two countries have a long-standing animosity continuing nearly seven decades because of Japan's 69-year-long occupation of South Korea until the end of the Second World War. But the newspaper article comes amid growing tensions between the two countries in the past week. The Japanese mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, triggered an international outcry after stating that South Korea's wartime sex slaves known as 'comfort women' were 'necessary' while three Japanese historians visited the disputed territory of South Korean-controlled Takeshima islets, known as Dokdo by Korea.

"PUBLISHED: . 09:37 EST, 29 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:38 EST, 29 May 2013 . With hand washing rates astoundingly low in healthcare workers and costs related to hospital-acquired infections in the billions, some hospitals have turned to high-tech surveillance cameras and sensors to encourage better hygiene for their doctors and nurses. When healthcare workers at Long Island, New York's North Shore University Hospital enter an intensive care room, for instance, a motion sensor is triggered. A camera is then turned on and its video footage sent to a center in India where workers watch to ensure proper hand hygiene is taking place. Which is just to say, to make sure doctors and nurses are washing their hands prior to interacting with patients. As simple a task as it may seem in an environment where professionals are trained to make split-second, life-saving decisions, studies have shown hand washing rates in hospitals to be dismal. Shocking: Studies show hospital workers need encouragement to wash their hands, with compliance rates as low as 30 percent in some hospitals . The New York Times says that studies show rates of hand washing in hospital workers prior to any type of patient interaction are as low as 30 percent without some form of encouragement. The reasons for non-compliance are many. Philip Liang, who founded General Sensing, which provides sensor badges to hospital workers that track their hand washing, says an overburdened mind might be a chief reason. ‘Nurses have to remember hundreds—thousands—of procedures,’ he told the New York Times. ‘It’s really easy to forget the basic tasks. You’re really concentrating on what’s difficult, not on what’s simple.’ Liang’s product knows when a healthcare worker has neglected to wash his or her hands. A badge vibrates when the worker approaches a patient’s bed, gently reminding them to scrub up. Dangerous: Hospital-acquired disease kills up to 100,000 per year and federal regulations will soon punish hospitals where preventable transmissions occur . Studies have also found that doctors, more than nurses or any other workers, are most resistant to washing their hands. The reason, according to the studies, seems to be a resistance to authority. ‘There are still staff out there who say, ”How dare they,”’ said Columbia University school of nursing’s Elaine Larson. To root out non-compliance and avoid losing Medicare funding under new federal rules that punish hospitals where preventable diseases are transmitted, hospitals have begun instituting an array of hand washing encouragement techniques in addition to the high-tech surveillance. Encouragement: Among other techniques, Beth Israel in Manhattan has its workers wear pins like these and officials say they really encourage patients to ask about hand washing . They are training hand washing coaches, hiring monitors who dress like hospital personnel and secretly watch for hand washing compliance, and giving out coupons for things like pizza and coffee to those who meet certain levels of compliance. Subtle: 'You do not want to say, ""You did not wash your hands,""' says Dr. Brian Koll of Beth Israel in Manhattan, where colleagues instead hand out red cards to non-complying workers, like a soccer match . Dr. Brian Koll of Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan trains compliance coaches. One of the techniques he uses, he borrowed from the sport of soccer. When one worker notices another has not washed his or her hands, they can be given a red card by their colleagues. ‘It’s a way to communicate,’ said Dr. Koll, ‘in a nonconfrontational way that also builds teamwork.’ Dr. Koll’s hospital also has its workers wear pins that read things like ‘Ask me if I’ve washed my hands,’ ‘Got Gel,’ and ‘Hand hygiene first’ and Koll said patients’ families, especially parents of pediatrics patients, aren’t shy about asking doctors about their cleanliness. At North Shore University Hospital, a . 2011 program saw the installation of digital scoreboards that record . hand washing compliance rates for each shift. The intensive care unit . saw a leap in hand washing rates. Prior . to the scoreboards, the numbers hovered around 6.5 percent compliance. With them, they reached into the 80 and 90 percent range. Workers . at places like Beth Israel who continue to exhibit bad hand hygiene can . be forced to take remediation classes. They must then, in turn, teach . other non-compliant workers what they learned. But for all the mild admonishments or coercion techniques, the real reasons for increasing hand washing rates is to save lives. A recent CDC report says drug-resistant superbugs are on the rise and nearly 100,000 patients die each year from infections acquired in hospitals. Effective: Some doctors are now under surveillance by observers in India who note hand washing non-compliance. Hospitals where workers know they're being observed have seen skyrocketing hand washing rates .","Hospital workers wash their hands as little as 30 percent of the time they interact with patients, studies show .

Cinemagoers might not realise that the supercars and scantily-clad partygoers in Fast and Furious 6 are partying at the heart of the Treasury . The scenes are a long way from the quiet number-crunching normally associated with the inner workings of the government's finance ministries . In the trailer for the film, released on May 17, Vin Diesel is seen driving into the circular court of the Treasury building . Fast Six sees the smash hit franchise return to cinemas next month, with Diesel’s professional criminal Dominic Toretto helping to bring down a new criminal gang in return for full pardons for the crimes of his own crew. As Toretto travels the world in an attempt to round up his crew, he arrives in London where he pulls up at the entrance to a huge open air party. But what most cinema-goers will not realise is the scene was filmed in the sedate surroundings of the 100-year-old Treasury building at the heart of Whitehall.

The site, known as Government Offices Great George Street (GOGGS) has been home to the Treasury since 1940. Mr Osborne was boosted by news today that the economy has grown by 0.3 per cent, better than many analysts expected. Industry insiders suggested big Hollywood films would pay between £2,000 and £5,000-a-day to hire commercial buildings. Filming took place over a weekend with extra security thought to have been laid on to keep the nation's financial secrets safe. The appeal of the Fast and Furious series has relied heavily on featuring young women and the latest cars . Some of the scenes are likely to raise eyebrows in Westminster . The poster for Fast and Furious 6, which is released in UK cinemas on May 17, also features views of the London skyline . It marks a radical move for the government, but with borrowing remaining stubbornly high every penny that can be raised helps. Total public sector net debt was a . record £1.2trillion in March, equating to 75.4 per cent of GDP and up . from £1.1 trillion a year earlier. The decision to hire out the building . was made by its owners, a contractor who runs the ministry under a . Private Finance Initiative contract. In the trailer for the new film Toretto is seen being asked by Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson, for help to catch a mercenary group which attacked a military convoy. He asks them to bring his elite team together in London, which is where the Treasury scene appears. Groups of young women in short skirts are seen dancing on cars in the government building’s circular court. The latest Bond film, Skyfall, used the roof of the Department for Energy and Climate Change to capture these scenes of the London skyline . A Treasury source confirmed the site was used by Universal Pictures for the film, but could not say how much the firm paid.

In May 2010, father-of-two Frank Golby, 65, had a CT scan that should have showed he was suffering from the early stages of lung cancer. However, staff at University Hospital Coventry told the former Rolls Royce worker that he was just suffering from a chest infection. Frank Golby (left) died after it took doctors two years to diagnose his lung cancer. He is pictured with his son, Mark . Mr Golby then continued to battle persistent pain for almost two years, coughing up blood and becoming anaemic, until he was rushed to hospital with breathing difficulties in February 2012. In A&E he was given a chest X-ray which revealed the tumour had grown to five times its original size. At this point, the doctors suspected that he was suffering from lung cancer but before they were able to act on their findings, or inform his family, Mr Golby died. The hospital has now admitted misdiagnosing Mr Golby, and accepts that early diagnosis could have prolonged his life by ten years, but his angry family have said it is all 'too little too late'. His son, Mark Golby, said: ‘My father put his complete trust in the doctors who treated him and had confidence that they were doing everything they could to help him. ‘He never discovered that the doctors had completely missed his cancer. Two years before he died, Mr Golby (pictured with his grandson), had a CT scan which should have told doctors that he had early stage lung cancer but he was told he just had a chest infection . ‘Looking back it's hard to believe the doctors missed the warning signs that something was seriously wrong. ‘He had been coughing up blood for months and still they did not think to check for cancer.’ Neil Clayton, a lawyer at medical negligence specialists Lime Solicitors, said: ‘An independent medical expert concluded that if clinicians had reviewed the CT scan taken in 2010, the one centimetre nodule on Frank's upper left lung would have been clearly visible and would in turn have indicated he was suffering from the early stages of lung cancer. His son, Mark, is now urging other people to seek a second opinion if they are worried about their symptoms . ‘At this point, the cancer was highly treatable and a combination of surgery and either radiotherapy or chemotherapy could in all likelihood have extended his lifespan by around ten years.’ Mark Golby said: ‘By the time he was admitted to hospital his breathing had become very laboured. ‘Even then we believed the doctors' diagnosis that he just had a chest infection and clung to the hope that it was a passing illness that he would get over. ‘The fact he was such a proud man who didn't like to complain, meant opportunities to make him comfortable were also missed. ‘The hospital had reassured my sister that there was no need for the family to dash up to see him as he was stable and would hopefully be home within a couple of days. Sadly he died the following morning.’ Following a full admission of liability, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, has offered a full apology to Mr Golby’s family and has paid a five figure out of court settlement. Mark Golby said: ‘Although sadly it's too late for our family, I would urge others to seek a second opinion if they find that their condition fails to improve. ‘No one wants a doctor to tell them they have cancer, but in dad's case, hearing those words two years earlier, when the scan was first taken, could have given him ten more precious years with his family.’ Frank, who worked at the Rolls Royce plant in Coventry for more than 30 years, leaves behind his wife Sandra, aged 62, a son and daughter as well as two grandchildren. University Hospital Coventry has apologised to Mr Golby's family and have paid compensation . Meghana Pandit, Chief Medical Officer at the trust said: ‘I would like to apologise to Mr Golby’s wife and his family that his cancer was not recognised when his scan was read. ‘While errors of this kind are extremely rare, it doesn’t detract from the pain and distress this has caused. ‘We have reviewed how the mistake was made and have tried to learn lessons from it. ‘We hope that the financial settlement can help in some way but we recognise it will never compensate Mr Golby’s family for their loss.’","Frank Golby had a scan in May 2010 and was told he had a chest infection .

Other regulations require shirts to be worn between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m, and shoes that 'adequately protect one's feet from wood or nails protruding from the surface of the boardwalk must be worn at all times'. Mayor Troiano Jr said the shoe requirement was a safety issue, while the clothing rules reflect the town's values and the image it wants to project. 'I know the social climate's changed and what people think is decent is different than it was,' Troiano said. Wearing pants low, often belted well below the hip, is a fashion popular among young skaters, who may soon be forced to pull up their pants in Wildwood, New Jersey . Commissioner Peter Byron said he supported the ordinance in its current form. 'I think it's obnoxious with these kids who wear their pants down around their knees,' Byron said, adding he sometimes receives complaints from people unhappy with the style of dress. Other towns such as Cape May and Ocean City have some regulation in place regarding clothing on their respective promenade and boardwalk. Meanwhile, laws similar to Wildwood's proposed ordinance have been enacted in communities around the country, including Terrebone Parish, Louisiana, and Cocoa, Florida. A public hearing on the ordinance is scheduled for June 12 at City Hall.","Ban would prohibit visitors to Wildwood, New Jersey's boardwalk from wearing pants more than three inches below the waist .

The bodies of a 16-year-old boy and his 52-year-old father were found at a River Ridge, Louisiana, home on Friday. The boy, Matthew Tarto, had been dead for several days before his father Mark Tarto died. Autopsy results revealed that both died from gunshot wounds to the head. Investigators at Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office suspect Mark Tarto murdered his son, then committed suicide several days later. Murder/suicide: Autopsy results confirmed that 16-year-old Matthew Tarto had been dead for several days before his father, Mark Tarto, committed suicide at the River Ridge home the two shared, according to authorities . 'This has all the earmarks of an apparent murder-suicide, and the autopsy supports that finding,' Colonel John Fortunato, spokesman for the Sheriff's Office, told The Times-Picayune. Authorities discovered the bodies after Mark Tarto's ex-wife Lisa Tarto became concerned that she hadn't heard from her child. The John Curtis Christian School where Matthew was a sophomore was also alerted after teachers noticed he had been absent since May 14. Matthew Tarto's football coach J.T. Curtis said it was unusual for Matthew to be away from school. 'He was a good student who was . extremely conscientious,' he said. 'That's what was so . unusual, for him to be out of school. He just doesn't miss.' Calm exterior: The 335 Celeste Ave home Matthew Tarto shared with his father, 52-year-old Mark Tarto. The father and son were found dead inside in an apparent murder/suicide . Curtis said school officials called the . Tarto home five times in the 10-day period between Matthew Tarto's May . 14th absence and the discovery of the bodies on May 24. According to Curtis, the school was informed by Mark Tarto that his son was suffering a lung infection. 'We checked again later in the week and . he was still sick,' Curtis said. 'We checked in the first part of the . next week and we were told he was going to get a chest X-ray.' Grim discovery: Lisa Tarto called the police and requested a 'residence check' when she became concerned after not hearing from her son, 16-year-old Matthew Tarto . Matthew Tarto died from a gunshot . wound to the back of his head. Coroner Gerry Cvitanovich said his body was found in . bed, and that it's likely he was shot while sleeping. Mark . Tarto's wounds are consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, . according to Fortunato. Deputies found his body in the living room . beside a semi-automatic pistol. Curtis told The Picayune-Tribune that the news Matthew had been killed by his father was hard to believe. 'When I tell you those two were as close as you could be, I could not be any more shocked,' he said. Court documents reveal, however, that Mark Tarto was the subject of allegations of abuse. According to The Advocate, when Lisa Tarto filed for divorce from Mark Tarto in the 24th Judicial District Court in 2008, she . told the court he accused her repeatedly of infidelity, interrogated her . friends about it and kept her up at night arguing with her. He . threatened her and belittled her in front of their . son, she said. Lisa Tarto cancelled the . divorce proceedings to reconcile with her husband, only for Mark Tarto . to file for divorce in 2010, asking for custody and alimony, and . claiming he was 'free from fault' in the collapse of their marriage. But Lisa Tarto alleged 'habitual cruel treatment' and 'extreme mental abuse' court records show. Lisa Tarto told the court that Mark Tarto . had cursed her, threatened to ruin her life and cut up her clothing. She said Mark Tarto exhibited 'unstable mental behavior'. She alleged that he had . 'brain-washed' their son and turned him against her, making Matthew . believe she had been unfaithful to his father. Neighborhood horror: Local news station 4WWL showed police cars arriving at the crime scene when 16-year-old Matthew Tarto was allegedly killed by his father, Mark, who committed suicide in the home days later . The court granted the divorce in October 2011 and the couple finalized a custody settlement in January. Curtis . said students and friends are preparing for Matthew Tarto's funeral, . scheduled for today in New Orleans. 'That will stir up a lot of . emotion,' he told the local paper. The . John Curtis Christian School website says the school made . counselors available to students and teachers struggling to deal with . their grief. 'The teachers, especially those who . taught him and had him in the past, struggled with it,' Curtis said. 'It . was very emotional.' Matthew Tarto was a backup offensive lineman on the school's 2012 Class 2A state championship football team. 'He was the kind of son any mother would hope for,' Curtis told WWLTV. Close: Lisa Tarto's Facebook profile is a picture of herself with her 16-year-old son Matthew Tarto. Other pictures on the page show Matthew as a small child and with a group of cheerleaders from his school . The school's Twitter feed is full of tweets about Matthew Tarto. 'Saw a guy in a Hoover High shirt. All I could think about was Joe McKnight and John Curtis owning the Bucs in 2006' wrote @garlandgillen. Matthew Tarto's teammates, cheerleaders and their parents gathered on Saturday for the school's annual spring scrimmage, some wearing Matthew Tarto's No. 56 on their cheeks. Tuesday was the last day of class for the school year, but Curtis said the school had emailed parents and asked them to notify the school if any students were displaying signs of difficulties or anxieties. 'We're going through a healing process,' he said. An online obituary has been set up for Matthew where friends and acquaintances can share memories of his life.","Authorities discovered the bodies of 16-year-old Matthew Tarto and his father 52-year-old Mark Tarto on Friday .

The Conquest Of Everest - Original Photographs From The Legendary First Ascent features a previously unpublished collection of photographs from the climb, put together by the late George Lowe, a member of Hillary's team, with help from family friend and historian Huw Lewis-Jones.

What goes up... A climber prepares to descend the Hillary Step as he makes his way down from the summit . News of the success of the expedition to scale Everest reached London on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation on June 2, 1953. It was the ninth British mountaineering expedition to attempt the first ascent of Mount Everest, and the first confirmed to succeed. The British felt under particular pressure, as the French had received permission to mount an expedition in 1954, and the Swiss another in 1955, meaning the British would not have another chance at Everest until 1956 or later. The 'Icefall party' reached Base Camp at 17,900 feet on 12 April 1953. A few days were then taken up, as planned, in establishing a route through the Khumbu Icefall, and once this had been opened teams of Sherpas moved tons of supplies up to Base. A series of camps were created, slowly reaching higher up the mountain, with groups of climbers gradually leap-frogging each other as they inched their way to the summit. By May 21, Wilfrid Noyce and Sherpa Annullu had reached the South Col, just under 26,000 feet, and the first of two previously selected climbing pairs, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, set out for the summit five days later. Using closed-circuit oxygen the pair successfully achieved the first ascent of the 28,700ft South Summit, coming within 300ft of the final summit until they were forced to turn back due to problems with their oxygen equipment. The next day the expedition made its second and final assault on the summit with the second climbing pair, the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal. They reached the summit at 11:30 am on 29 May 1953, climbing the South Col route. Dr Lewis-Jones, who worked with him . for several years before his death to put together his memoirs and . photographs from the climb said today's signing had proved to be 'quite a . mountaineers' flashmob'. 'It's right that we do everything we can to remind the world of the story of the guys of '53, quite amazing men,' he said. He added that having Peter Hillary and Jamling Tenzing Norgay at the occasion was particularly special. 'These guys have lived with it all their life, it's a special moment when guys come together on the 60th anniversary, but to be together at that exact moment that their fathers reached the summit is great,' he said. 'Both Peter and Jamling gave little speeches and reflected on Everest 60 years on.' Dr Lewis-Jones said he was proud to have worked on the book with Mr Lowe, adding: 'A book is a book, it's not climbing Everest but it was massively emotional. 'It was a huge honour for me to have an opportunity to work with George on a book. 'You don't always get a chance a work with your heroes.' Other climbers who have summited Everest were also honoured in today's celebrations in Kathmandu. 'Sixty years ago exactly on this day, Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made what many people thought impossible possible. So we are very thankful and grateful to them ... we can all make many of our impossible dreams possible,' said Shailee Basnet, 29, a Nepalese climber who scaled Everest in 2008. Basnet is one of a few Nepalese women climbers and is leading a team of women on a mission to climb all 14 of the highest peaks in the world. The anniversary celebrations will continue today with a reception at the Royal Geographical Society which will also be attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. In Nepal a gala event at the palace of the country's former royal family will be attended by a host of famous mountaineering figures.","Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit on May 29, 1953 .

After a string of customers complained the Michael Graves Stainless Steel Tea Kettle resembled the World War II dictator, the retailer was forced to deny any intentional link. But as the kettle became an internet sensation on Monday after appearing on a huge billboard over the 405 Interstate Highway in southern California, it also became a sell-out item, according to The Atlantic.

Among the gifts reportedly provided by ex-gangster Mani Chulpayev were jewelry, cars, lavish hotel stays, sports tickets and cash - among other items. Chulpayev was arrested last month in connection to the death of young rapper Melvin Vernell III - known as Lil Phat - in Sandy Springs, Georgia last year. Informant: Former Russian gangster Mani Chulpayev has accused his FBI handler of accepting gifts from him that included jewelry, cars, sports tickets and cash . Victim: Chulpayev was arrested last month in connection to the murder of young rapper Melvin Vernell III - known as Lil Phat - in Sandy Springs, Atlanta last year . Chulpayev's lawyer, George Plumides, says that his client was betrayed by those who were supposed to be protecting him, and it may have steered authorities in Georgia to bring murder charges against his client. Plumides told ABC News: 'The agent obstructed a murder investigation. That's my opinion and it is Mani's as well.' Plumides added: 'It's nice to have an FBI agent that is looking over your shoulder, I guess. But I think he was ill-served. He didn't get a bargain.' The FBI confirmed to ABC News that its . inspection division, as well as the Department of Justice, are looking . into the allegations against the agent, Dante Jackson. Accomplice? Also arrested in the murder of Lil Phat was San Francisco basketball star Decensae White. He was taken into custody earlier this month and extradited to Georgia . A bureau spokesman told the network: 'We take the allegations very seriously. The policy on this could not be more clear.' Plumides claims that even when . Chulpayev was under investigation in the murder, Jackson had asked him . for $3,500 and various gifts. Speaking to WSBTV, District Attorney Paul Howard said that his office was looking into Chulpayev as a possible suspect shortly after the murder, but he would not say whether that was because the FBI interfered. 'Maybe sometime after we get this murder [investigation] completed then we'll look at some of the people that are involved in this incident, like the FBI participation,' Howard told the station. Lil Phat was killed in June 2012 in a parking deck next to the Northside Hospital Women's Center. Two men were seen leaving the seen after Lil Phat was shot. Also arrested in the murder was San Francisco basketball star Decensae White. He was taken into custody earlier this month and has been extradited to Georgia. Reports said that Lil Phat was at the hospital because his child was about to be born. The 19-year-old, known for being featured in rapper Webbie's popular 2007 song, 'Independent.'

A new 'liquid breakfast' drink which claims to contain more fibre than bran flakes has gone on sale. The milk-based drink is targeted at those too time-pushed to eat breakfast, in a bid to provide a quick shot of nutrients on the run. Called Liquid Fuel, it is said to be the first beverage to be sold in supermarket cereal aisles. It is claimed the drink offers more fibre than a 30g serving of Bran Flakes and four times the protein found in two Weetabix. But critics say that with the equivalent of 10 spoons of sugar, the drink isn't as healthy as it seems. Convenient: The breakfast drinks are said to contain more fibre than bran and more protein than eggs - but critics say they are loaded with sugar . The drink, which is pasteurised and sold in a carton - meaning it doesn't need to be refrigerated - is the first to appear alongside cereals in UK supermarkets. It is made up of 50 per cent milk with other ingredients including soya protein, thickeners, vitamins, dried glucose syrup and natural flavourings. It's claimed the drink contains 5g of fibre per serving compared to just 3.9g per 30g helping of Kellogg's Bran Flakes and 20g protein - more than the 12g found in two whole eggs. But nutritionist Zoe Harcombe was sceptical about the benefits of the drink. She told MailOnline: 'Are we really so lazy and care about our bodies so little . that we won't even take two minutes to make porridge or five minutes to . boil some eggs? 'The world does not need any more fake food. The world needs humans to put a tiny bit of effort into eating properly once more. Hungry: The new drink is aimed at men, 74 per cent of whom are are said to skip breakfast . 'The product boasts about it's fibre and protein content, but the real alternatives (not sugary cereal comparators) still win. 'The manufacturer is not comparing like with like. Calorie . for calorie (this breakfast drink has approximately 300 calories per . serving), there is 50 per cent more fibre in oats and 35 per cent more . protein in eggs. 'The . product doesn't mention the 44g of sugar per serving - about 10 . teaspooons - not the best way to start the day if you want to keep blood . glucose levels stable.' Research two years ago by the yogurt manufacturer Onken found that some 64 per cent of people sacrifice breakfast for extra time in bed or to get to work earlier. Men skip their morning meal the most, with 74 per cent admitting lunch is their first meal of the day, the survey found. The drink, which costs between £1.49 and £1.89, is the brainchild of former Innocent employee Barney Maulevere. The entrepreneur, based in Shaftesbury, Dorset, said the breakfast market has stagnated in Britain and is ripe for a shake-up. 'A . lot of people these days, particularly men, are not having breakfast, . he said. 'We present it as everything you need for your morning fix.'

The 17-year-old was supposed to get picked up on Monday for a trip to the beach with his friends, but his father had other ideas and the carload of teens left him behind. It would be the last time Tamer would see his friends alive. The five teens, two boys and three girls, died late Monday afternoon in the wreck that left the car they were riding in split in two and engulfed in flames. Tragedy: Five teens in California were killed after the car veered off the road and struck a tree . Sisters Christine, left, and Robin Cabrera were among the five teens killed in a fiery crash in California on Monday. They were both students at Irvine High School . Two of the other victims were Omar Soussan, left, and Cecilia Zamora . Among the victims were two of . Mosallam's closest friends and a pair of sisters who had performed in a . high school dance extravaganza over the holiday weekend. 'I was supposed to be with them in . the car, that's why there were three girls,' Mosallam said, explaining . that he was to have been the third boy for a three-way double date. 'They came to my house but my dad wouldn't let me go out because I was studying for a test.' A visibly shaken Mosallam and several . dozen other students from Irvine Unified School District, where all the . victims were enrolled, gathered outside Irvine High School on Tuesday . to try to make sense of the tragedy. Police said speed was a factor in the single-car wreck on a busy, six-lane surface street and the investigation was ongoing. The driver was identified as 17-year-old Abdulrahman Alyahyan, a senior at University High School. The passengers included 17-year-old . Robin Cabrera, a senior at Irvine High, and her 16-year-old sister . Aurora, a sophomore at the same school. Also killed in the Monday crash were Cecilia Zamora and Nozad Al Hamawendi, both 17-year-old juniors at Irvine High. There was no class Tuesday because it . was a teacher development day but counselors would be on hand . Wednesday, said Ian Hanigan, a spokesman for the Irvine Unified School . District. 'There are simply no words to convey . the sorrow felt by our students and staff, nor are there sufficient . answers to explain the loss of five vibrant teenagers from our schools . and this community,' Irvine Unified School District Superintendent Terry . Walker said in a statement. Horror: One police official said the crash was among the worst he's seen in nearly 30 years on duty . The families of Zamora and Alyahyan . declined to comment when reached by the media. Families of the other . teens could not be reached for comment. Friends who gathered Tuesday outside . Irvine High said the five were headed to the beach for a fun Memorial . Day when the tragedy unfolded on a busy thoroughfare that connects . Orange County's interior network of freeways with the famed Pacific . Coast Highway and its beaches. Authorities said the wreck was one of . the worst in Newport Beach in recent memory and left two of the . victims' bodies so damaged the coroner had to rely on fingerprints to . identify them. The car hit a tree in the median, shearing it of its bark and leaving deep gouges in the trunk. The Cabrera sisters were both . accomplished dancers in the school's dance program, friends said. They . had performed in a three-day recital over Memorial Day weekend, said . Brie Martinez, 15. '(Aurora Cabrera) was kind of nervous for her dance but I heard she did really good,' said Martinez, as she began to cry. 'I saw something about the crash on the news last night, but I never would have guessed it was them,' she added. Zamora was also in the dance program and performed over the weekend, said her friend, Paloma Douglas, a junior at the school. Tragic accident: Cars drive past the scene of a Monday fiery car crash that killed five in Newport Beach, California . Douglas last saw Zamora on Friday afternoon, when the two attended the same history class — the last course of their day. 'She was sitting next to me, so it's going to be tough seeing that empty seat,' said Douglas. Friends said Alyahyan, the driver, . was obsessed with his Infiniti sedan, given to him by his older brother, . and spent hours working on it and driving it around with his best . friend, Al Hamawendi. 'Abdul loved cars. He took care of his car as if it was a human being,' said Ibrahim Razzak, a junior. The two boys were inseparable and . were part of a larger group of about 10 close friends who were either . first- or second-generation immigrants from various Middle Eastern . countries, said Zach Darwish, an 18-year-old senior at University High . who was also close friends with the two boys. The teens all spoke Arabic together when they hung out, which was constantly, he said. Alyahyan came to Irvine from Saudi .

Further tests have been ordered on the body of Gareth Williams, the 25-year-old father-of one, who may be the first victim of a major UK measles epidemic. Mr Williams was found dead in his flat in Port Tennant, Swansea, South Wales, one week ago. A post-mortem examination to establish the cause of his death has proved inclusive, the Swansea Coroner's Office confirmed today. Gareth Williams (right) had been suffering with measles when died last week . 'The results were inconclusive and further tests have now to be carried out,' a spokesman said. The measles epidemic, centred on Swansea, showed no sign of slowing today as the latest figures for the area were released. Measles cases in the region have jumped by 56 in the last two days as the headline total reached 942. Worst hit are children and teenagers aged 10 to 18 who missed out on the vital measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab when they were younger. That was due to unfounded fears that the three-in-one vaccination was somehow linked to autism in children. Meanwhile, a major £20 million programme to vaccinate one million children and teenagers across England has been announced. It has been prompted by fears that the epidemic in Wales could spread across the border into England. In common with Wales, a large number of people missed out on the MMR jab and are unprotected against the spread of the disease. Before his death last week, father-of-one Mr Williams was in a relationship with Cairo Oneim (right) In both cases unfounded fears the three-in-one jab was linked to autism in children was responsible for the drop in vaccination uptake. Public Health Wales (PHW) today urged teenagers preparing to sit crucial GCSE and A-level exams to ensure they are vaccinated. The measles epidemic has infected over 900 people in South Wales . Major efforts to vaccinate thousands of children and young adults who missed out in the past are still under way. Weekend drop-in clinics held in a handful of hospitals in the region have seen thousands of anxious parents attending with their children. An urgent in-school vaccination programme has also been going on in parallel to ensure children are protected against the disease. The outbreak in Swansea is one of the biggest to have hit the UK in the last decade. Fears the disease could spread to . England have triggered a major catch-up vaccination programme targeting . one million children and teenagers. The £20 million programme will see GP surgeries, schools and community programmes used as vaccination centres. The campaign will target children and young people who have not had either one or two doses of the MMR jab. The scheme comes after Public Health England (PHE) revealed there were 587 confirmed measles cases in the first three months of this year in England. That is more than three times the 168 cases in the same period of 2012. A major vaccination programme continues unabated in Wales which has so far seen 83 people admitted to hospital due to the illness since the outbreak. Although the outbreak is centred mainly on Swansea, rates of measles are high throughout the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University, Powys and Hywel Dda health board areas, especially in Neath Port Talbot and North Powys. Health officials have also launched a nationwide programme to help stem the measles outbreak and prevent it spreading more widely across the UK. At least a million children and teenagers are to be vaccinated against measles in an attempt to stop expected outbreaks in England. Some will never have had a jab, while others have only had the first of two doses of the MMR vaccine. The £20million campaign follows a big rise in cases in South Wales, where public health officials have been running clinics to increase protection rates.","Measles cases in the region have jumped by 56 in the last two days .

"Bachmann's New Hampshire team claim they were 'treated as second class citizens' by 'rude' campaign . Bachmann spokesman hit back, saying: 'They want to call names, that's their prerogative' By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:54 EST, 26 October 2011 . Presidential Candidate Michele Bachmann registered by mail for New Hampshire's presidential primary after her staff's abrupt resignation last week. With all five of Mrs Bachmann's paid staff members in her New Hampshire office abandoning ship last week, the vying presidential contender could have opted to travel to the Granite state but chose to file by mail instead. Those now former-staffers have complained of receiving a cold shoulder by the candidate's national team, as well as to have been treated rudely. Iowa's 'it': Michele Bachmann has publicly acknowledged keeping her focus on the state of Iowa, choosing to slip an appearance to register for the New Hampshire primary this week . Most of the other presidential candidates have chosen to file in person, finding a campaign opportunity in their appearance. Separate from that crowd, Texas congressman Ron Paul sent a staff member to file on his behalf early Monday morning, though the former Governor of Utah Jon Hunstman arrived himself by the late afternoon in addition to former-governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney. With Vice-President Joe Biden's appearance, he filed on behalf of both himself and President Obama. Mrs Bachmann has visited New Hampshire twice since beginning her campaign, publicly acknowledging her decision to focus primarily on Iowa. The five former staffers of Mrs Bachmann had said, however, that they hold no ill will toward the Minnesota congresswoman, but they could not continue working for her because the national campaign team had been 'rude, unprofessional, dishonest, and at times cruel' to them. Scroll down for video . Problems: The five former staffers said they could not continue working for Bachmann because her national campaign team had been 'rude, unprofessional, dishonest, and at times cruel' to them . A press release issued by the New Hampshire team also accused the campaign as being 'abrasive, discourteous, and dismissive' of the state's voters. 'These are our neighbors and our . friends, and some within the national team treated them more as a . nuisance than as potential supporters,' the group wrote. The letter went on to tell how they had all been . full-time, paid employees until September 11, when they were asked to . temporarily go 'off payroll' due to financial concerns. Mrs Bachmann's New Hampshire campaign manager, Jeff Chidester, voluntarily took himself off payroll at the beginning of September until the end of the campaign because funds were so poor. 'It saddens this team to see a dedicated . patriot – a person so desperately needed in the White House – . sequestered behind a wall of pretense, guarded by political operatives . consumed by their own egos,' the group wrote. Alice Stewart, Mrs Bachmann's national spokeswoman, responded by labelling the group 'name callers' and admitted the national focus was on Iowa. Stranger: Michele Bachmann has visited New Hampshire just twice since announcing her campaign blaming her absence on the debt limit debate . 'Name calling': Alice Stewart, Mrs Bachmann's spokeswoman, dismissed the allegations . During her latest trip to New Hampshire earlier this . month, she blamed her frequent absence on the August debate in Congress over . raising the nation's debt limit. In an interview with John King on CNN, Ms Stewart responded to the criticism of the national team, of which she is a senior part, by saying: 'That's unfortunate. They want to call names, that's their prerogative. We wish them the best.' 'It is disheartening when members of the staff or volunteers or people who are working with the team decide to communicate with the media as opposed with the campaign,' Ms Stewart continued. 'We haven't heard anything from these people. It is unfortunate they chose to make it in such a public way.' However, the staffers made clear they tried to inform people within the national operation of their concerns well before they issued the press release. Mrs Bachmann's campaign manager, Keith Nahigian, sought to discredit the authenticity of the people behind the letter. 'The unauthorized news release was sent by a person who doesn't even work for the campaign and has never had authority to speak on behalf of the campaign,' he said. 'We are not responding to comments made by a person who was not even a staff member in New Hampshire.' Ms Stewart said that while the New . Hampshire operation was important, winning Iowa was the primary focus . for Mrs Bachmann and her campaign. 'First . and foremost, we have to get through the important first caucus state,' Ms Stewart told CNN. 'That's what she's focused on.' Little chance: Former campaign manager Ed Rollins quit in September, stating, 'I think legitimately it's a Romney-Perry race' Praying for miracle: The latest poll numbers are not good for Mrs Bachmann, pictured with husband Marcus, with support at five per cent . The New Hampshire exodus is the latest staffing dilemma to to hit Mrs Bachmann's campaign. In September, campaign manager Ed Rollins made a high-profile exit, saying the congresswoman's chances of winning the GOP nod had dwindled. He called her the 'third-candidate'  and said: 'I think legitimately it's a Romney-Perry race.' Mr Rollins revealed that his deputy David Polyansky would also stand aside. Earlier this month, seasoned Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who served as an adviser to Mrs Bachmann, and senior policy adviser Andy Parrish left her 2012 campaign. Since winning the Iowa straw poll in August, Mrs Bachmann's poll numbers have been on the slide and according to the latest Gallup poll, constucted between October 3-7, she has just five per cent support for the nomination. Harsh words: The press release which accuses Mrs Bachmann's national team of rudeness . Mitt Romney, on 20 per cent, Herman Cain, 18 per cent, and Rick Perry, 15 per cent, are out in front. Recent polls have also shown that despite earlier success, Mrs Bachmann is now rated no higher than fourth place in the Hawkeye State. In their statement issued on Sunday, . the former New Hampshire staffers also tried to clarify confusion that arose on Friday . when Mrs Bachmann's national spokeswoman disputed reports of a staff . shake-up. The group . said Mr Chidester quit . on Thursday following several 'serious incidents' during Mrs Bachmann's recent trip to the Granite State, but he informed the national campaign that others might be . interested in staying if national officials reached out to them. The other four staffers quit on Friday after their efforts to get in touch with the national team to discuss their concerns were ignored, they said. The group says that 'through all this chaos' they were, 'deceived, . left out of the loop regarding key decisions, and relegated to . second-class citizens within a campaign in which they were the original . members'.","Bachmann's New Hampshire team claim they were 'treated as second class citizens' by 'rude' campaign .

An infant’s risk of developing autism could be determined by looking for problems in the placenta at birth, scientists revealed today. Researchers at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and the University of California in Davis say their findings will allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment for the developmental disorder. One in 100 Britons are estimated to have autism, while one out of 50 children are diagnosed with it in the U.S. each year - but this diagnosis is usually made when the children are aged three or four. Newborn: The best chance for intervention is when the brain is most responsive to treatment in the first year . This causes problems because the best chance for intervention is when the brain is most responsive to treatment in the first year of life, according to the researchers at both universities. Dr Harvey Kliman of the Yale School of Medicine and scientists at the MIND Institute of UC Davis have studied abnormal placental folds and abnormal cell growths known as trophoblast inclusions. The scientists have found that these are key markers to identify newborns who are at risk for autism. Dr Kliman and his team examined 117 placentas from infants of at-risk families - those with one or more previous children with autism. The at-risk placentas were compared to 100 control placentas. The at-risk placentas had 15 trophoblast inclusions, while none of the control placentas had more than two, according to the findings published today in the Biological Psychiatry journal. Study: Researchers at Yale University (pictured) in New Haven, Connecticut, and the University of California in Davis say their findings will allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment for the developmental disorder . Dr Kliman said a placenta with four or more trophoblast inclusions suggests an infant will have a 97 per cent probability of being at risk for autism. 'Regrettably, couples without known genetic susceptibility must rely on identification of early signs or indicators that may not overtly manifest until the child’s second or third year of life' Dr Harvey Kliman, Yale University . Until now the best early indication of autism risk has been family history – with couples having a child with autism being nine times more likely to have another child with the disorder. Dr Kliman said: ‘Regrettably, couples without known genetic susceptibility must rely on identification of early signs or indicators that may not overtly manifest until the child’s second or third year of life. ‘I hope that diagnosing the risk of developing autism by examining the placenta at birth will become routine, and that the children who are shown to have increased numbers of trophoblast inclusions will have early interventions and an improved quality of life as a result of this test.’","Study by scientists at Yale University and University of California in Davis .

In the aftermath of Osama Bin Laden’s death there was huge pressure for Barack Obama to release as many details as possible about the killing. So it’s understandable that one politician feels rather peeved about Hollywood gaining special access to the secret raid in Pakistan for a film. Rep. Peter King wants to know if Sony and director Kathryn Bigelow got too many details about the raid that killed the Al Qaeda leader in May. Project: Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow is working on a film about the Navy SEAL raid that took out Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan last May . The House Homeland Security Committee chair released Pentagon and CIA letters that consider how sensitive details should be given out. The Pentagon letter said the inspector general's office for intelligence matters will look at how defence staff released information to filmmakers. The CIA said its public affairs office is making a ‘single point of reference that will govern future interactions with the entertainment industry’. Rep. King has expressed worries about the administration's cooperation with Sony Pictures Entertainment and 'Hurt Locker' director Ms Bigelow.

She has been working on a film with screenwriter Mark Boal about the dramatic hunt for Bin Laden following the 9/11 terror attacks on the U.S. Ms Bigelow was forced to defend the Bin Laden film in August after she was accused of using it to get President Obama re-elected. The timing of the film - and its close proximity to Election Day in 2012 - had angered some Republicans. She openly supported President Obama in 2008, while he was campaigning for president and she was promoting The Hurt Locker. Rep. King was worried in August when the New York Times reported that Sony and Ms Bigelow got ‘top-level access to the most classified mission in history’. He claimed classified leaks over the raid had resulted in the arrests of Pakistanis believed by Pakistan authorities to have assisted the CIA. The Pentagon and CIA’s role in the film was ‘bound to increase such leaks, and undermine these organisations' hard-won reputations’, he said. He wanted details on talks among the .

A 91-year-old WWII veteran fighting to prevent his daughter from evicting him from his Ohio home has raised more than $138,000 from online donors to buy back his home, easily surpassing his goal. John Potter says he's 'amazed' by the more than 5,000 people who have donated toward his original $125,000 goal while telling his granddaughter, Jaclyn Fraley, 'I never knew people could love an old man so much.' After Mr Potter's daughter sent him an eviction notice earlier this year, Ms Fraley organized the desperate fundraiser for him in April while sharing with the public his dire situation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Success! John Potter, 91, seen earlier this year during his campaign to buy back his home, says he's 'amazed' by the more than 5,000 people who have donated beyond his $125,000 goal . Evicted: Earlier this year Mr Potter's daughter, Janice Cottrill, sent him an eviction notice after she illegally signed over this home he built 53-years old to her name, according to his granddaughter . Donations immediately poured in from around the world from those touched by the military veteran in Zaleski, Ohio whom they too called 'grandpa.' This week the fundraiser passed its goal just in time for Mr Potter's 92nd birthday on Thursday. In 2004, as Ms Fraley tells, Mr Potter was battling a serious illness when he handed his general power of attorney rights to his daughter, Janice Cottrill. Unbeknownst to Mr Potter, she used that power to convey the deed to the one-story, three-bedroom home he built 56-years ago to herself. Mr Potter says he can't understand how his family would turn on him like this. 'When I got out of the army and got on my feet on the ground, I rented a power shovel and dug a hole in the ground, built a basement and built a house on top of it,' he told ABC of the home. He doesn't believe the house is worth all that much, having built it with the sole and simple purchase of housing his family. When Mr Potter learned of the deed transfer in 2010 he switched power of attorney to his granddaughter, Jaclyn, who's now 35. Jaclyn Fraley, 35, hasn¿t spoken to her mother and stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to place her grandfather in a nursing home . Early this year Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction notice, saying she they had terminated his 'existing lease' She hasn’t spoken to her mother and stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to sell her grandfather's home and place him in a nursing home. Mr Potter has already attempted to sue to get his home back, arguing that his daughter had transferred the deed to herself illegally. He initially won a county court ruling, but last year an appeals court ruled that because the statute of limitations of four years had passed on the accusation of fraud the deed could not be handed back to Mr Potter. Early this year, Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction notice, saying she they had terminated his ‘existing lease.’ Ms Fraley said her grandfather and her mom had argued over visitation rights for Mr Potter's autistic son, Joe, who Mrs Cottrill took over custody for in 2008. ‘I laid awake at night trying to figure out what in the world I could have done to these people to make them so angry at me,’ he told WCMH earlier this year. Potter turns 92 this week and his grand-daughter says she would love to be able to give him back the rights to his home for his birthday . With an eviction hearing due to take place on June 12, time was steadily running out for the aging vet who fought against the Japanese in the Pacific and also worked as a train dispatcher for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. In a bid to try and raise the money to buy his home back, granddaughter Fraley launched her campaign on GoFundMe.com, the crowd-fundraising site. 'John Potter just wants to live what remaining life he has left in the home he built with his wife, in which he raised his family, and has lived for the last 56 years,' Fraley wrote on the site. With the money raised, she believes he now has a fair shot. 'As the donations keep coming, please know any money we have raised above the cost of the house will go to anything Grandpa may need for the house or what is needed to take care of him in his home,' Ms Fraley wrote while promising to keep those funds 100 transparent. Ms Fraley says she plans to throw her grandfather a potluck dinner in his home on Saturday to celebrate his birthday this week.

Britain was warned economic recovery will be a ‘marathon, not a sprint’ yesterday as official figures showed an unprecedented triple dip recession has been avoided. In a significant boost for Chancellor George Osborne, gross domestic product grew by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year. The figure is far better than expected and comes in spite of the unseasonably cold weather, which helped depress retail sales and construction. The economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of 2013, avoiding the third recession since 2008, the Office for National Statistics said . Mr Osborne, pictured today, has been boosted by news that the economy has grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of this year . The Chancellor used Twitter to say the figures were proof that the 'economy is healing' Mr Osborne said ‘the economy is . healing’ but warned there could be further difficulties ahead. He said: . ‘Despite a tough economic backdrop, we are making progress. ‘The deficit is down by a third, . businesses have created over a million and a quarter new jobs, and . interest rates are at record lows. ‘We all know there are no easy . answers to problems built up over many years, and I can’t promise the . road ahead will always be smooth but by continuing to confront our . problems head on, Britain is recovering and we are building an economy . fit for the future.’ Between January and March GDP grew by . 0.3 per cent, which is well ahead of the 0.1 per cent rise expected by . analysts. It was enough to stave off a third recession in five years . after the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of . 2012. The service industries including hotels and transport accounted for most of the growth in the economy, while construction suffered a 2.5 per cent slump . Business Secretary Vince Cable said the 'road to recovery would be a marathon, not a sprint' while Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted the economy was not out of the woods yet . A recession is defined as two . consecutive quarters of decline and Britain has suffered two since the . financial crisis struck – the first in 2008-09 and the second in . 2011-12. Growth was driven by the dominant . services sector, a bounce-back in North Sea oil and gas production, and . soaring demand for energy, as households turned up the heating during . the cold snap. Output from services firms – which range from hairdressers and hotels to accountants and train operators – rose 0.6 per cent. Industrial production rose 0.2 per . cent, thanks largely to a 3.2 per cent increase in ‘mining and . quarrying’ as North Sea production recovered from extended maintenance . work on crucial oil rigs at the end of last year. Meanwhile the energy . supply sector rose 0.5 per cent. But factory output fell 0.3 per cent . and construction was down 2.5 per cent as vast swathes of the economy . remained firmly in recession. It also appears increasingly likely . that the Office for National Statistics will revise away last year’s . ‘double dip’ recession. The change in GDP in the last quarter . of 2011 was recently revised from minus 0.4 per cent to minus 0.1 per . cent – and further amendments are expected, particularly to the first . quarter of 2012, which was also just minus 0.1 per cent. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince . Cable said that the growth was ‘modestly encouraging’ but added that the . recovery was a ‘marathon, not a sprint’. The government was hit by the news that an extra 70,000 were unemployed in the first three months of 2013 . Meanwhile, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls . made the startling claim that the deficit had only fallen because of . the ‘inheritance’ left by the Labour government. He added: ‘These lacklustre figures . show our economy is only just back to where it was six months ago... If . we’re to have a strong and sustained recovery we need urgent action to . kickstart our economy and strengthen it for the long-term.’ John Mann, a Labour MP on the Commons . Treasury Select Committee, claimed the figures confirmed ‘the . Japan-isation of the British economy’. Latest figures reveal how government borrowing remains stubbornly high at £120.6billion in 2012-13, down just £300million on the year before . He said: ‘In Japan, the economy . stagnated. Sometimes it went down to below zero, sometimes just above it . but it kept on this very low-growth trend and kept there for 15 years. ‘We are in the same cycle and breaking out of it will need a change of policy.’ Weak growth has pushed Mr Osborne’s . plans to cut the record deficit racked up by Labour off course, and . borrowing fell by just £300million to £120.6billion last year. Tory MPs Brian Binley (left) and Mark Field accused the Chancellor of being timid and complacent about the need for bold action to secure strong economic growth . But the return to growth will have . come as a huge relief to the Treasury just days after Britain suffered . another downgrade to its AAA credit rating, this time by ratings agency . Fitch, and the Chancellor was criticised by the International Monetary . Fund. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard . said Mr Osborne was ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with . austerity while the economy was so weak. Now the Chancellor’s position will be bolstered as he prepares to defy any formal recommendations from the IMF to change course. Rob Carnell, an economist at banking group ING, said the figures were ‘one in the eye’ for the IMF and the ratings agencies. Of the major economies listed in the IMF's World Economic Outlook, the prediction of 0.7 per cent growth for 2013 puts the UK well below the US, Canada, Japan and much of Europe . The unrelenting gloom over Britain’s economic prospects has lifted, with growth making an unexpectedly bright reappearance in the first three months of the year. Timing could not be better for George Osborne ahead of what had promised to be a bruising encounter with the examiners from the International Monetary Fund, who are due in London early in May. The 0.3 per cent lift in output, after a decline in the final months of last year, was described as ‘lacklustre’ by the Chancellor’s critics on the Labour benches. But it does mean that the fearful vision of a triple dip, so avidly discussed by broadcasters ahead of the data being published, has been vanquished. Indeed, revisions to past data suggest the double dip – two successive downturns in the economy since a peak in 2008 – will also turn out to have been a fiction. This does not mean Britain is in the midst of a storming upturn. But what is absolutely clear is parts of the economy are, with the help of the shock treatment of record low interest rates, back to where they were before the ‘Great Recession’ of 2009-10. Behind the emerging recovery is a sharp bounce back in the services sector, which includes everything from the high street to financial services and creative industries, and comprises some 80 per cent of the nation’s output. International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing . Director Christine Lagarde suggested Mr Osborne should consider changing . the pace of his deficit reduction programme . It is now 1.5 per cent higher than a year ago and has fully recovered from the trough of the recession. The buoyancy of services is one of the reasons some 500,000 new private sector jobs have been created in Britain over the past year. Unfortunately for the Chancellor, his desire to rebalance the UK economy back to manufacturing and exports is not going so well. Manufacturing remains deep in the doldrums, despite a sharp devaluation of the pound that was meant to help exports. The depression in manufacturing can largely be blamed on the disastrous conditions in the eurozone, with unemployment in Spain surging to an incredible 27 per cent. Construction is also disappointing, partly because of the exceptionally cold winter weather than dragged on for months. However total industrial output is on the mend, largely as a result of greater output from  North Sea oil and gas that was sharply down late last year. The Chancellor had expected a difficult encounter with the IMF team. The Fund’s top economist, Olivier Blanchard, has argued publicly that Britain is ‘playing with fire’ with its continuing austerity measures. The latest numbers suggest that even with our biggest trading partner in the eurozone mired in chaos the UK economy is still capable of expanding, if not at the pace the Government would like to see.","Overall figures better than expected easing pressure on George Osborne .

The chief person of interest in the investigation of deadly ricin-laced letters that were sent to President Obama and other officials has gone missing, authorities said on Thursday. Everett Dutschke had been under surveillance but slipped away on Wednesday, according to Itawamba County Sheriff Chris Dickinson who is working with the FBI. Itawamba deputies searched a home in Ozark, Mississippi where Dutschke was believed to have been on Wednesday and found no one. Scroll down for video . Disappeared: Everett Dutschke, the chief person of interest in the case of deadly ricin letters being sent to President Obama, has gone missing . The sheriff says he believes a friend of Dutschke 'may be helping him to lay low'. FBI spokeswoman Deborah Madden would not comment on the search. Dutschke did not answer his cellphone when attempts were made to contact him on Thursday. Charges in the case were dropped against earlier suspect Kevin Curtis. Curtis, an Elvis impersonator had been charged with sending the poison letters last week. He said  he may have been framed by Dutschke, an accused child molester, martial arts instructor and political candidate with whom he has been rivals for several years. Federal authorities on Tuesday dropped all charges against Curtis and spent several hours searching Dustschke's house in Tupelo, Mississippi. Dutschke addressed the media and denied he sent the ricin letters. While the drama plays out in a series of baffling TV interviews given by both sides, the FBI has said little about its investigation. Dutschke has not been named as a suspect by authorities and has not been arrested. Southern-fried feud: J Everett Dutschke, left, and Kevin Curtis, right, are both caught up in the federal investigation over poison letters sent to the president. They are both also martial arts rivals . Sweet relief: Paul Kevin Curtis, who had been in custody under suspicion of sending ricin-laced letters to President Obama and others, left, hugs his attorney Christi McCoy during a news conference following his release Tuesday . However, he admitted a longstanding animosity with Curtis. Dutschke says he is a member of MENSA, the society for high-IQ individuals. Curtis claims to be a member of the group, as well. 'He is not a MENSA member,' Dutschke emphatically said as federal agents and hazmat crews combed his house. 'The certificate he posted online is a lie.' During a strange and rambling press conference on Tuesday, Curtis said Dutschke 'hates him.' He offered several reasons why. 'I don't if it’s a martial arts kind of conflict and he thinks you’re better than him and he wants to challenge you in the rink. I don’t know,' he said. Both men are trained in the Korean martial art of taekwondo and they agreed to a showdown at a local martial arts studio in Tupelo. 'At one point on the phone I did say, ""If you wanna meet somewhere just you and I..."" and he said, ""Taekwondo Plus, Main Street."" I said, ""I’ll be there in 20 minutes."" 'Framed': Kevin Curtis, who works as an Elvis impersonator, may have been set up by a man who was once his brother's business partner, his lawyer says . Accused: J Everett Dutschke, right, had his home raided by federal agents on Tuesday after Curtis lawyer alleged he might be behind the ricin attack. He is seen here with Senator Roger Wicker . Denial: Dutschke has said he had nothing to do with the ricin attacks and is a 'patriotic American' 'I drove there. He wasn’t there. Then he sent me an email, ""Come back tomorrow at 7 and the results of you being splattered all over the pavement for all the world to see what a blank blank blank blank you are."" And then at that point I knew that I was dealing with a coward.' Both men are also musicians. Dutschke plays blues guitar and has released several albums under the name Dusty and the Robodrum. Curtis tours across the south as an Elvis impersonator. It's all nonsense, Dutschke told reporters on Tuesday. 'He’s crazy. He’s just a little nutty. I don’t have a relationship with him,' Dutschke said. Curtis, for his part, said Dutschke is 'delusional.' In a CNN interview on Tuesday, Curtis' lawyer Christi McCoy said her client has mental issues. Federal authorities wanted to have him evaluated for competency before trying him in court. Curtis heaped praise on his lawyer for fighting for him and ensuring he was quickly exonerated. 'In the jungle of the law and court, you have monkeys, you have kangaroos and you have lions. She was the lion queen. She was just amazing,' he told CNN's Piers Morgan. 'I've never heard of ricin or whatever. I thought they said rice. I told them I don't eat rice,' Curtis said at a press conference Tuesday, describing the moment he was questioned by federal authorities. McCoy said whoever framed her client was able to lead the FBI to his door simply by including Curtis' catch-phrase 'I'm KC and I approve this message' and a few other clues in the threatening notes that were mailed to Washington. Musician: Kevin Curtis works as an Elvis impersonator and performs music for a living. He once performed for Senator Roger Wicker, one of the politicians who received ricin in the mail . McCoy suggested in court on Monday that . federal authorities should instead investigate Dutschke. She later told CNN that federal agents have not recovered any physical evidence tying Curtis to the poisoned letters. On Tuesday afternoon, six days after Curtis was arrested, the U.S. Attorney dropped terrorism charges against him. He had been accused of sending letters laces with the deadly poison ricin to the offices of Obama, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker and Lee County Judge Sadie Holland. 'I respect President Obama. I love my country and would never do anything to pose a threat to him or any other U.S. official,' Curtis said Tuesday. McCoy suggested in federal court on Monday that Dutschke is one of the men who the FBI should investigate in the ricin case. Dutschke, she said, is a former friend . of Curtis and that the two had a falling out over a book Curtis wrote . called 'Missing Pieces.' On . Friday afternoon ten local officers and federal agents raided Dutschke's house in Tupelo . and searched it. Dutschke denied any involvement in the ricin case on . Tuesday. 'I'm a patriotic American. I don't have any grudges against anybody. I did not send the letters,' Dutschke said. He said he was asked to take a lie detector and that police had previously questioned him as well. Dutschke and Curtis are both musicians, are both politically active and are both heavily interested in martial arts. Dutske was arrested early this year and charged with molesting three girls - including a teenager he 'touched' between 2007 and 2011, an eight-year-old girl and a seven-year-old girl. He has not yet stood trial for the charges and is free after posting $25,000 bail. Found nothing: Curtis' lawyer said that despite extensive searches of his home, federal agents did not recover any physical evidence linking Curtis to the ricin letters . McCoy said that whoever framed her client dropped obvious clues that led federal investigators to arrest Curtis. Curtis made several posts on Facebook about the 'organ donation industry.' He signed each of his posts with the phrase 'I'm KC and I approve this message.' He also authored a book on organ donation called 'Missing Pieces.' The poison-laced notes included a reference to the book, as well. A day earlier, FBI Agent Brandon Grant . testified searches on Friday of Curtis' vehicle and house in Corinth, . Mississippi, found no ricin, ingredients for the poison, or devices used . to make it. A search of Curtis' computers found no evidence he . researched making ricin. 'There . was no apparent ricin, castor beans or any material there that could be . used for the manufacturing, like a blender or something,' Grant . testified. He speculated that Curtis could have thrown away the . processor. McCoy believes the only explanation is that somebody else set her client up. 'It's horrific that somebody would do this, but yes, I believe that's what happened,' McCoy said. Still, Grant testified that authorities believed they have the right suspect. 'Given the right mindset and the Internet and the acquisition of material, other people could be involved. However, given information right now, we believe we have the right individual,' he said. Suspect: The FBI has arrested a suspect accused of sending letters laced with ricin to President Obama, pictured on Wednesday, and a Mississippi senator . Hound dog: Curtis posted hordes of pictures on his Myspace page showing him from the 1980s and 90s . Grant said lab analysis shows the poison in the letters was in a crude form that could have been created by grinding castor beans in a food processor or coffee grinder. Grant testified Friday that authorities tried to track down the sender of the letters by using a list of Wicker's constituents with the initials KC, the same initials in the letters. Grant said the list was whittled from thousands to about 100 when investigators isolated the ones who lived in an area that would have a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark, which includes many places in north Mississippi. He said Wicker's staff recognized Curtis as someone who had written the senator before. All the envelopes and stamps were self-adhesive, Grant said Monday, meaning they won't yield DNA evidence. He said thus far the envelopes and letters haven't yielded any fingerprints.","J. Everett Dutschke, a former political candidate and accused child molester, has disappeared .

The hacked-up bodies of a photojournalist and another young man have been found in the northern Mexico city of Saltillo, authorities said Thursday. Photographer Daniel Martinez Bazaldua, 22, had recently been hired to cover social events for Vanguardia, the paper said in a story in its online edition. Officials identified the other man as Julian Zamora, 23. Saltillo is in northern Coahuila state, an area where the Zetas drug cartel is active. Another Coahuila newspaper recently announced it would no longer publish stories about drug gangs, after receiving threats apparently signed by a Zetas leader. Brutal slaying: Newspaper staff photographer Daniel Martinez Bazaldua, 22, was found hacked up along with another young man in the northern Mexico city of Saltillo . Budding career: Martinez Balzadua was recently hired to cover social events for the paper Vanguardia . State prosecutors said the bodies were found Wednesday in a jumbled pile of severed parts on a street, next to a hand-lettered message that appeared to indicate the Zetas were responsible for the killings. The state government said the sign suggested the two young men had deserted from a drug gang.Coahuila state Attorney General Homero Ramos told reporters later that investigators had testimony indicating both men ‘were participating in illegal activities.’ Vanguardia criticized that accusation, noting that the message left at the scene also contained threats to police. ‘We think it is sad and alarming that Coahuila has become a state in which the authorities condemn murdered people, converting them into criminals, without offering the least evidence,’ the newspaper wrote. ‘Only a serious, professional investigation can find out the truth that society deserves,’ Vanguardia said. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Forensic technicians stand around the dismembered bodies of two men at a crime scene in Saltillo . Dangerous town: Saltillo is in northern Coahuila state, an area where the Zetas drug cartel is active . Vanguardia Editorial Director Ricardo Mendoza told The Associated Press that Martinez Bazaldua was ‘very calm,’ ‘friendly’ and ‘enthusiastic,’ and said he did not know whether the killing was related to his work as a photographer. In some cartel-plagued cities in Mexico, covering even the society section can be dangerous, because cartel leaders may hang out at prominent social events and get angry if they are included in photos. In some cases, if they want the attention, they can be angered if they are left out. The Inter-American Press Association condemned the photographer's killing and demanded authorities do a thorough investigation. It also said it was regretful that state authorities almost immediately linked him to organized crime. ‘It's irresponsible that without doing a minimal investigation, authorities immediately linked the killings a vengeance by members of organized crime,’ it said. Four journalists have been killed in Coahuila and two more have gone missing since 1989. None of the cases have been solved, the association said. Press advocates have long called Mexico one of the most dangerous nations for reporters. But there isn't a single, agreed-upon figure on crimes against journalists. Cartel connection: A handwritten sign was left near the bodies suggesting that the Zetas drug gang was behind the slayings, and that the two victims had tried to leave the cartel . The Committee to Protect Journalists says in its latest report published in February that 12 Mexican journalists went missing in 2006-2012 and that in the same period 14 were killed because of their work. Mexico's human rights commission lists 81 journalists who it says have been killed since 2000.In 2012, Mexico's special prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression said 67 journalists had been killed and 14 had disappeared in the country since 2006. On Thursday, the lower house of congress approved a bill that would allow journalists to request that federal prosecutors and federal judges investigate attacks on them, and to establish cases in which such federal intervention would be obligatory. The bill was previously approved by the senate and has now been sent to the president for his signature.","Daniel Martinez Balzadua was hired by newspaper Vanguardia to cover social events .

At least 37 people were killed and hundreds more injured in a 6.1 magnitude earthquake near a nuclear plant in southern Iran on Tuesday, Iranian officials said.

Wrong thong: Tiara Monique Garness, 22, was arrested on Friday for refusing to cover up her thong swimsuit . A 22-year-old woman was arrested and charged with indecent exposure for wearing a thong bathing suit in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Friday morning. Tiara Monique Garness of High Point, North Carolina, was arrested at 5 a.m. Friday in the 1700 block of Ocean Boulevard, the arrest report said.

Ministers plan to use £1billion of the NHS budget to pay for social care – effectively tearing up the Coalition’s pledge to ringfence Health Service spending. The move comes amid fears hospital accident and emergency departments are being flooded by patients who could be cared for at home. Despite a promise to protect the NHS from the £11.5billion cuts the Treasury has ordered for 2015/16, the proposals could see more than  £1billion funnelled from the Department of Health to local authorities. A&E waiting times have risen and needy patients have been left on hospital trolleys . Ministers will argue that pouring NHS funds into community care will enable some elderly patients and those with chronic conditions to be treated outside hospital, reducing pressure on overstretched A&E units – which will in turn save the NHS money. But removing money from the NHS will prove highly controversial, since the Prime Minister was boasting earlier this week that the Coalition is spending more on health. With the NHS already having to save £20billion for the four-year period of the spending review, critics will argue that other services could suffer. Proposals could see more than £1billion funnelled from the Department of Health to local authorities . Town hall chiefs have reduced dramatically their funding of social care as a result of budget cuts, leaving people with long-running health conditions to seek help in hospitals instead. A&E waiting times have risen and needy patients have been left on hospital trolleys because of ‘bed-blocking’ by those who should be treated at home. Last year nearly 900,000 waited longer than four hours and recent reports suggest some patients wait up to 12 hours to be seen. A source said the plan was a ‘win-win’ because ‘if you look after people outside hospital you relieve the pressure on Health Service budgets’. Non-ringfenced departments have been ordered to find cuts of around 10 per cent in  their 2015/16 budgets. Plans will be submitted on Monday to the Treasury, with the final deal announced in June.",Comes amid fears that A&E departments are being flooded by patients who could be cared for at home .

Striking teachers in Mexico's Guerrero state attacked the offices of four political parties and a building of the state's education department Wednesday after the legislature approved an education reform without meeting their demands. Dozens of teachers carrying sticks and stones smashed windows, spray-painted insults at President Enrique Pena Nieto on walls and destroyed computers and furniture. They set fire to the state headquarters of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and another building. Scroll down for video .

The statue burns - the graffiti translates into 'Traitors sell country' No injuries were reported as the teachers, some masked, ran wild after a protest march in the state capital of Chilpancingo. Minervino Moran, a spokesman for the strikers, said the attacks were in response to the approval by Guerrero's legislators of legislation similar to a recently adopted federal education law that requires teachers to be evaluated and that seeks to remove control over hiring and firing from the teachers' union. 'We as leaders and as a movement endorse these actions because there is a lot of anger, a lot of outrage with the decision the (state) congress made,' said Moran, a spokesman for Guerrero state's Education Workers Union. The 20,000-member group went on strike in Guerrero state, where the resort city of Acapulco is located, shortly after Pena Nieto signed into law the sweeping education reform two months ago.

The constitutional amendment eliminates Mexico's decades-old practice of allowing the buying and selling of teaching jobs, and replaces it with a standardized national teaching test. That's heresy to a radical splinter union of elementary and high school teachers in Guerrero, one of the country's poorest and worst-educated states. The teachers claim the test is a plot to fire them all as a step toward privatizing education, although there is little evidence the government plans that.

Gus Dorman looks like an average 5-year-old, but with an IQ of 147, there is nothing average about one of the youngest members of the exclusive Mensa club. Dorman, of Collinsville, Illinois, learned to read while singing Karaoke. The kindergartener also knows every element on the periodic table, every state in the US and every country in the world. While his classmates at Renfro Elementary School are busy learning their ABCs, the 5-year-old prodigy reads entire books, like Charlotte's Web, and keeps himself informed about world events by reading newspapers in the bathroom. Scroll down for video . Wunderkind: Gus Dorman started reading newspapers in the bathroom (left) when he was 18 months old; nowadays, he solves second-grade-level math problems and enjoys brain teasers (right) Techie: Gus was using an iTouch before he could walk, and one of his favorite reads is Wired Magazine, which reports about technology . Voracious reader: Even when the Dorman family go camping, they bring along plenty of books and magazines for Gus to read . The boy's father, Rob Dorman, told Stltoday.com that he and his wife, Kotomi, knew their son had some 'unique abilities' even when he was an infant. 'He started reading when he was 18-months-old,' Dorman said. 'He was sitting on the porta-potty reading a newspaper. I noticed that he liked to look at maps so I put one up. In about a week's time, he had memorized everything on it. He's just always been very clever.' But the Dormans said that they had no idea Gus, who is their firstborn, was truly gifted until this past February, when a family friend was shocked to discover that then-4-year-old boy was able to read a slogan off someone's clothing. The parents said that because they had never had a child before, they just assumed that all kids develop at Gus' breakneck pace. Last month, the Dormans  had their son tested for intelligence quotient (IQ), and the results confirmed their suspicions: the 5-year-old scored in the 99.98 percentile in seven of eight categories on the Standford-Bient Intelligence Scale. On the knowledge test, he scored just above genius level, earning him a spot in the exclusive Mensa club where the qualifying IQ score is 135. Brilliant boy: The young prodigy learned how to read as a toddler from singling karaoke. Not before long, he was reading newspapers over his breakfast cereal . Little Renaissance Man: The 5-year-old knows every element in the periodic table (left) and the capital of every state in the US (right) Child's play: Gus takes Japanese lessons, attends an after-school program and is eager to learn about black holes and astrophysics . Mensa has 110,000 members in 100 countries, the youngest of whom is 3 years old. Born on October 27, 2007, little Gus was reading newspapers over his breakfast cereal before age 2. According to his parents, their son mastered letters, words and full sentences by singing karaoke at home, Mr Dorman told MailOnline. These days, one of his favorite reading materials is Wired Magazine, which reports on technology. In fact, Gus’ father told MailOnline in a phone interview Thursday that his son is such a voracious reader that the family travels with a large supply of books and journals even when they go camping. The toddler could count to 1,000 even before setting foot in kindergarten and was able to put together a 1,000-piece puzzle of the periodic table. A doctor who examined the little boy told the Dormans that he is a very fortune child because most kids who display this kind of unique characteristics are usually ‘twice exceptional’:  intellectually gifted children who have some form of disability, such as autism. Gus, however, does not fall on the autistic spectrum, according to Mr Dorman. Last to know: Rob Dorman (right) and his wife (left) had no idea that their son (center) was a wunderkind until a friend noticed that the toddler could read . Welcome to the club: Gus scored 147 on an IQ test, earning him a membership in exclusive Mensa group, where the qualifying score in 135 . Keeping busy: Gus, pictured with his parents meeting the Cardinals mascot, also plays the piano and goes to soccer practice . Even before he could walk, Gus was absorbing information like a sponge from an iTouch. Nowadays, he uses an educational app on an iPad to teach himself second-grade math, reading and writing. Gus has an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and sometimes he even stumps his parents with his ceaseless questions. One day, the toddler was asking his father chemistry questions one after another until Mr Dorman finally ran out of answers. Seeking to provide his son with the information he sought, Rob Dorman called Southern Illinois University and asked to speak to the chemistry department, which ended up sending a graduate student to the Dormans’ home for dinner. But even the chemistry scholar was left confounded by some of Gus’ sophisticated questions. In another instance reported by ABC News, Gus got into a heated argument with his dad, who told him that the capital of Alaska is Anchorage. The 5-year-old insisted that it is Juneau - and he was right. 'Normal' kid: A doctor who examined Gus told his parents that unlike many gifted children, the 5-year-old does not fall on the autistic spectrum . Oddly enough, however, Gus has not been doing well in school. His father said the 5-year-old cannot sit through a lesson because he gets bored learning material that he already knows. As a result, he often gets in trouble for acting out. 'He thinks he's a bad kid but he just needs to be challenged,' Mr Dorman told Stltoday.com. Rob Dorman and his son have been regularly attending school board meetings asking the Collinsville School District to address the needs of students with special abilities by providing them with an intellectually stimulating environment, such as a gifted program. 'If a kid was deaf or blind, the school district would do something about it,' Dorman said. 'But for a profoundly gifted student, there is nothing.' however, Vicki Reulecke, the district's director of curriculum and assessment, said the district does not have enough money in the budget to provide specialized services for gifted students. Still, Gus’ days are jam-packed with learning. He is being taught Japanese at home and also takes formal language classes every Saturday at Webster University. Proof of brilliance: Rob Dorman submitted an application to a gifted program, which included some of Gus' math worksheets (left and right) He also studies at the Kumon after-school learning program for children, takes piano lessons and goes to soccer practice. But the Dormans are still hoping to find an educational setting for their wunderkind to meet his rapidly evolving intellectual needs. Last month, Mr Dorman submitted an application on Gus' behalf to the Davidson Gifted Young Scholars Program. While they await a response, Rob Dorman said he is happy to teach his son what he knows about the boy's two new passions: black holes and astrophysics.","Gus Dorman started reading newspapers and Wired Magazine when he was 18 months old .

The Star says the case was filed Monday in the Johannesburg High Court by Mandela's daughters, Makaziwe and Zenani.

The two daughters claim that Bizos, Sexwale and Chuene were never appointed by Mandela as major shareholders or directors. Bizos claims the allegations are completely false.

President Barack Obama has paid tribute to America's fallen soldiers in a moving Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery - as he urged the nation not to forget the tens of thousands of troops still protecting the country in Afghanistan. 'Let us never forgot to always remember the sacrifice they make in our name,' he said at the final resting place for many of America's war heroes. 'Today most Americans are not directly touched by war, as a consequence not all Americans may always fully grasp the depths of sacrifice - the profound costs that are made in our name,' he said. 'Our troops, our military families understand this and they mention to me whether the country fully appreciates what is happening. Let us never forget that our nation is still at war.' He suggested fewer people are today touched by war due to the all-volunteer military force and advanced technology that allows the U.S. to accomplish some missions with far fewer personnel. But he reminded the nation not to forget the 60,000 troops who are still fighting in Afghanistan. Scroll down for video .

A sex attacker who stalks schoolgirls has been spared jail after a judge said he sympathised with his frustration that he had never had a ‘full sexual relationship’. Andrew Jackson, 48, was told that he deserved a prison sentence but, as he has Asperger’s syndrome, sending him to jail would be ‘utterly cruel’. Jackson is known to follow young girls on his moped and cause them distress, often by striking up sexual conversations with them. Passing sentence at Hull Crown Court, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC, told him:  ‘You have never had a full  sexual relationship – it must be very frustrating. ‘I wish to make it plain you deserve to be sent to prison. But you are very much to be pitied. ‘I have a public duty, but it would be quite wrong to impose a cruel punishment. ‘Quite frankly you could not cope in prison. I have no doubt your life would be a misery.’ Jackson, who lives with his  parents in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, admitted sexual assault on a 21-year-old woman in April last year. She was sitting on a park bench when she was molested by Jackson, the court heard. A friend heard her cries of ‘help, help’ and dragged him  off her. Jackson was given a two-year supervised community order designed to change his behaviour and was ordered to sign the sex offender register. The judge also imposed a ten-year sexual offences prevention order, to limit his contact with girls under 16. Judge Richardson said justice demanded he took a ‘thoroughly exceptional course’ and show that the courts were ‘not without compassion’ by ignoring sentencing guidelines and sparing Jackson the ordeal of prison. He said: ‘Young girls have to be protected in your area. ‘You have to learn to control yourself. I regard sexual offences as a very serious crime. ‘Usually the men involved deserve to be sent to prison. ‘It would not be right here. It would be bordering on cruelty. However, if you harass any more girls you will end up in jail.’ Andrew Jackson, 48, stalked schoolgirls and sexually assaulted a disabled woman in Bridlington, East Yorkshire (pictured) The judge said Jackson had a number of ‘eccentric and obsessional characteristics’. The court heard that, before the sex attack, police officers had already spoken to Jackson on two occasions about stalking children in playgrounds and wooded areas. Took pity: Judge Jeremy Richardson QC allowed Jackson to walk free from Hull Crown Court, saying it would be 'utterly cruel' to imprison him . He showed a girl of 13 his private parts and in a separate incident had a sexual conversation with two girls of 14. These incidents are understood to be an example of a  pattern of behaviour. Prosecutor Martin Sharpe said police in the seaside town were so concerned about the threat he posed that they wanted a legal order banning him from playgrounds. ‘There are a number of times he has followed young children,’ he said. ‘He has regularly been noted. He follows them and causes them distress.’ Patrick Palmer, defending, said Jackson had a low IQ, did not work and although his condition could not be cured it could be managed on a day-to-day basis. The prevention order bans Jackson from living or working with girls under 16 as well as having any association with a girl, unless a responsible adult is aware of his offending history. But Claude Knights, of the charity Kidscape, questioned whether the judge had been too compassionate, adding: ‘This is a very disturbing case. ‘We have to ask whether the courts have hit the right balance in their attempt to show compassion by ignoring sentencing guidelines. ‘It must not be forgotten that the safety of children and young people is paramount.’ Judge Jeremy Richardson told Andrew Jackson at Hull Crown Court (pictured) that he should be pitied. He added: 'You have never had a full sexual relationship. It must be very frustrating.'","Andrew Jackson, 48, twice stalked schoolgirls aged 13 and 14 and sexually assaulted a disabled woman in Bridlington, East Yorkshire .

A bearded man was filmed ‘praying’ shortly before the attempted murder of a French soldier in Paris, it emerged today. The high quality CCTV footage strengthens the theory that the attacker was an Islamist fanatic inspired by the killing of a British serviceman in London. It came as pictures were released of 23-year-old Private Cedric Cordier, the Frenchman attacked in La Defense district of west Paris on Saturday evening. Scroll down for video . The manhunt for a suspected terrorist who tried to kill a French soldier is still underway in Paris . The soldier, who was stabbed in the neck while he was on anti-terrorist patrol, was released from hospital today but is said to have been left ‘traumatised’ by the ambush. Detectives have now confirmed that there are ‘high quality images’ of a ‘tall, athletic bearded man’ aged about 30 and of North African origin praying near the crime scene. ‘He ran away into a crowded train station, and is still at large,’ said a source close to the investigation. The French attack happened just three days after Lee Rigby, a British soldier, was allegedly hacked to death by two Islamists near Woolwich barracks, in south London. Manuel Valls, France’s interior minister, said the Paris attack appeared to be an ‘act of terrorism’ and police were pursuing ‘serious leads.’ Police are conducting DNA tests after finding a bag near the crime scene with a box cutter, and a sheath for a second knife. Police officers stand near the cordoned off spot where the French soldier was stabbed in the throat in the busy commercial district of La Defense, outside Paris .

Parisian newspaper he was in a state of shock and shot bolt upright in . his hospital bed when a nurse came in during the night, convinced it was . his attacker ‘come to finish the job’. Aurelie added: ‘He is really lucky to be alive. Two centimetres further, and it would have been his carotid artery. ‘You'd expect this sort of thing if he was on a mission to Mali but you don't expect that in Paris,' she said. France has been on high alert for . attacks by Islamist militants since its military intervention against . Islamist rebels in Mali in January. That prompted threats against French interests from AQIM, the North African wing of al Qaeda. The latest warning was published on . YouTube a few weeks before gunmen this week attacked a military base and . a French uranium extraction site in the central African state of Niger, . killing 24 soldiers and one civilian. Paris police conceded yesterday that the stabbing  was inspired by the terrorist murder of Drummer Lee Rigby. VIDEO: French police statement in wake of attack on soldier in Paris . France's defence minister said the soldier stabbed in Paris on Saturday was targeted because he was in the army and vowed to continue his country's 'implacable' fight against terrorism .

Hundreds of Maoist rebels attacked a convoy of leading Indian politicians, killing 24 people on Saturday. Militants ambushed members of the Congress Party as they returned from a campaign event in Chhattisgarh, central India, planting landmines and shooting party leaders and supporters. Four state party leaders and eight police officers were among the victims of the attack, which also saw 37 people injured. Attack: Indian medical staff take an injured victim into the Ram Krishna Hospital in Raipur after an ambush on a convoy of Congress Party leaders by Maioist rebels . Today, Indian officials reacted with outrage at the attack, which was carried out in Chhattisgarh’s tribal community as an apparent warning to officials to stay away from the Maoist rebel stronghold. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party President Sonia Gandhi visited some of the injured in a hospital Sunday in the Chhattisgarh state capital Raipur, promising the government would take firm action against the perpetrators. ‘We are devastated,’ said Gandhi, who denounced the ‘dastardly attack’ as a on the country's democratic values. Rajnath Singh, president of the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said the country should unite in its fight against the Maoist insurgency, known as Naxalites. The convoy was attacked in a densely forested area about 215 miles south of Raipur as the Congress members were returning from a party rally. Grief: Relatives of victims of the attack, which killed 24 people and injured 37, cry outside the hospital in Raipur . Uprising: According to police officers, 11 of the 37 injured are still in a critical condition following the ambush in a forest in the central Indian state . Damage done: A man in blood-covered trousers is treated for his injuries in the attack which saw about 200 suspected Maoist rebels set off a land mine and open fire on the convoy . Solidarity: Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, second from left, and chairperson of the National Advisory Council, Sonia Gandhi, fourth from left, meet an injured person at a Raipur hospital on Sunday . About 200 attackers blocked the road . by felling trees, forcing the convoy to halt. Police officer R.K. Vij . said the suspected rebels triggered a land mine that blew up one of the . cars. The attackers then fired at the Congress party leaders and their . supporters before fleeing. Congress . is the main opposition party in the state. It has stepped up political . activities, trying to win the support of tribals, ahead of state . elections scheduled to be held by December. Police officer Vij said 11 of the 37 injured were in serious condition. Police . identified one of those dead as Mahendra Karma, a Congress party leader . in Chhattisgarh who founded a local militia to combat the Maoist . rebels. The anti-rebel militia had to be reined in after it was accused . of atrocities against people of lower castes, known as ‘tribals’. Planned ambush: Wreckage of a vehicle lying in the dense forest area at the incident site after the Maoists attack . Destruction: A man stands next to a crater caused by a land mine blast in the rebel attack on Saturday . Fatal: Indian security personnel carry the body of one of the victims of Saturday's rebel ambush in Bastar, 215 miles south of Raipur in Chhattisgarh state . The dead also included state Congress party chief Nand Kumar Patel and his son. K.P.S. Gill, a former police chief of Punjab state who has written widely on . reform, said the attack was ‘a very horrifying incident.’ However, Gill said the state government was incapable of devising a strategy to tackle the Maoist threat. ‘They don't have the political will and bureaucratic and police set-up to prevent such attacks,’ he said. He said the state government had ignored the need for special forces to tackle the threat. ‘Most of the special forces in the state are being used for non-operational duties like guarding state politicians,’ he said. Protest: Congress Party supporters burn an effigy of Dr.Raman Singh, the chief minister of the Indian state of Chhattisgarh during a demonstration against the attack . Prime Minister Singh has called the rebels India's biggest internal security threat. They are now present in 20 of India's 28 states and have thousands of fighters, according to the Home Ministry. The Naxalites  have been fighting the central government for more than four decades, demanding land and jobs for tenant farmers and the poor. They take their name from the West Bengal village of Naxalbari where the movement began in 1967. The fighters were inspired by Chinese Communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and have drawn support from displaced tribal populations opposed to corporate exploitation and official corruption. The government has offered to begin peace talks with the rebels, but without success. The Maoists demand that it first withdraw thousands of paramilitary soldiers deployed to fight the rebels. Maoist rebels carried out two major attacks in Chhattisgarh in 2010. They ambushed a paramilitary patrol in April that year, killing 76 troops in their worst attack ever. A month later, they triggered a land mine under a bus carrying civilians and police, killing 31 people.","Maoist rebel attack in central India kill 24 and injure 37 .

Jenna Miscavige, said she was kept away from her parents sometimes for over a year at a time, forced to break rocks on a riverbed and grilled on her sex life at the tender age of 13. Things got so bad that at the age of 16, when she was stopped from seeing a boyfriend, she climbed out onto the roof of Scientology's celebrity headquarters on Hollywood Boulevard and was ready to jump before church elders frantically pulled her back inside. Speaking out: Jenna Miscavige (right) niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige (left) has told how she was driven to try and commit suicide after enduring a miserable childhood inside the church . Drop: Ms Miscavige said she tried to jump off the the roof of Scientology's celebrity headquarters in Los Angeles but was held back by church officials . In her new book Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology And My Harrowing Escape, Ms Miscavige tells how she managed to escape the clutches of the church, famous for its celebrity devotees like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. And she claims Cruise's six-year-old daughter Suri had a lucky escape after her mother Katie Holmes split from the superstar actor. Ms Miscavige, 29, told the Sun: 'I don't know what will happen to Suri in her relationship with her mother but I know the Scientologists tore my family apart'. Escape: Ms Miscavige claims Cruise's daughter Suri . had a lucky escape after her mother Katie Holmes split from the . superstar actor . In her incredible account of growing up inside the church, Mrs Miscavige Hill told how her parents had joined the Sea Orgs, the church's elite inner circle, and worked 14 hour days. She was brought up in a Scientology Nursery before being sent to a ranch in the Californian desert where her days were spent breaking rocks on a riverbed. At 13 she was given her first 'audit' in which she was quizzed about her sex life, by elders who demanded to know if she masturbated or had homosexual feelings - the sort of information which she believes they later use to blackmail members. At the age of 16 she fell in love with a boy, but when church leader discovered they had had sex they hit the roof and tore him away from her to be 'purged' - the event that led her to attempt suicide. Eventually the church agreed they could marry with the ceremony being held at the celebrity Scientology centre in LA, none of her family attended, there was no honeymoon and the couple were imemediately sent back to work. Ms Miscavige's parents had left Scientology In 2000, when she was 16 years old, after becoming   disillusioned with its practices. In the five years that followed, she has claimed that - because of the church's policy of 'disconnection' with relatives and friends who do not support the cult - all letters between them were intercepted and she was not allowed to answer the telephone for over a year. Her book details how she and her husband Dallas, were sent to Australia by the church, in a missionary-style or work-exchange program. It was there that she reportedly first came into contact with the internet, which, along with television, is banned by the church and began to read negative reports about her uncle. For Ms Miscavige, a major turning point was when she decided she wanted to become a mother. While married Sea Orgs are allowed to have sex, they are not permitted to have children. 'If you do become pregnant when you're there, you get kicked out,' she told The Huffington Post. 'Or many of my friends were actually coerced into having abortions,' she alleged.

Though Scientology members accosted both she and her husband when they started talking about leaving, they remained strong and stayed together. After leaving the church, Ms Miscavige, with Kendra Wiseman and Astra Woodcraft - both also raised in Scientology - founded the website exscientologykids.com. The site was launched as support group offering 'non-judgmental support for those who are still in Scientology, discussion and debate for those who've already left, and a plethora of easy-to-understand references for the curious'. Memoirs: Jenna Miscavige Hill, 28, daughter of David's older brother Ron, has been a frequent critic of the Church of Scientology since publicly breaking with it in 2005 . Following the public split between the cult's most famous member, Tom Cruise, and wife Katie Holmes, Ms Miscavige Hill spoke out in support of Holmes and the couple's daughter Suri. 'My experience in growing up in Scientology is that it is both mentally and at times physically abusive,' she said in a statement released through the Ex-Scientology Kids website.

'While it is very unlikely that Suri Cruise would have the same upbringing as me (due to her parent's celebrity status), any organization that is capable of mistreating and neglecting the needs of children, regardless of their social status, and which has a long history of breaking up families is no place for an innocent child. Scientology has been dogged by controversy almost since the day it was created. The belief was founded in 1952 by L Ron Hubbard who until then had been known for writing pulp and science fiction novels. Followers believe that inside them are ancient alien beings known as thetans which have lived for thousands of years on other planets and were brought to Earth on a space ship that looks like a Douglas DC-8 plane. Through a process called Dianetics they make themselves far better people, and even massively boost their IQ. Such claims however have never been proved and instead Scientology has faced allegations it charges outrageous fees for its services and abuses its followers. Among the most controversial aspects are 'audits' in which followers have to explain their inner secrets to a superior, including their sex lives. There have also been reports of bizarre punishments and questions have been raised over what happened to the wife of its current leader David Miscavige, who has reportedly not been seen since 2007. Those who join the higher order of Scientology, known as Sea Org, pledge their allegiance for one billion years - a vow supposedly made by children as young as 10. Scientology courts Hollywood stars and famous followers include Tom Cruise and John Travolta but it is very rare that they speak about their beliefs. Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes was said to have ended over her refusal to allow their six-year-old daughter Suri to be indoctrinated. She was also said to be concerned about the child being sent to the Scientology Gold Base in California where members are banned from having children, are paid just $50 a week and can be punished for simply looking at somebody the wrong way. Scientology was also the basis of the current cinema hit The Master in which a drifter is taken in by the leader of a cult-like group.","Jenna Miscavige is the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige .

The 70-year-old millionaire pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of indecent assault against seven girls and young women aged 14 to 19. The offences are alleged to have taken place between 1966 and 1985. The king of celebrity PR, who has represented clients including Simon Cowell and the late Big Brother contestant Jade Goody, was heckled by two protesters and mobbed by cameramen when he arrived at court in central London. He held hands with his wife and former PA Jo Westwood as police battled to force a way through to the court entrance. Scroll down for video . Mobbed: Max Clifford was escorted by police officers as he battled his way through photographers crowded outside Westminster Magistrates' Court . Not guilty plea: Max Clifford, seen with his wife Jo Westwood outside Westminster Magistrates' Court, today denied 11 allegations of indecent assault . Prosecutor Deborah Carr told Westminster Magistrates’ Court that Clifford had displayed ‘a continuous pattern of sexual predatory behaviour’ over 20 years. He looked calm in the dock as he confirmed his name, address and age in a hushed tone. The 11 charges were read to him by the court clerk and to each Clifford replied ‘not guilty’. Outside the court, the publicist complained of being kept ‘virtually in the dark’ since his arrest last December. He said: ‘The last few months have been an absolute nightmare.’ He claimed he had only recently been supplied with the identities of his accusers, whose names were read out in court yesterday with the charges. The earliest allegation dates back to when Clifford was a 22-year-old press officer with the music company EMI. The first charge, relating to a 14-year-old girl, is said to have been committed on an unknown date between January 1966 and September 1967. Support: Clifford was accompanied by his wife Jo Westwood at Westminster Magistrates Court . Court case: Publicist Clifford, who was arrested in December in relation to allegations of indecent assault, famously represents high-profile clients including music mogul Simon Cowell . Charges: The PR guru, 70, arrived at Westminster Magistrates' Court to face 11 charges of indecent assault relating to the period between 1966 and 1985 . Scrum: The publicist was met by hordes of photographers outside Westminster Magistrates' Court . Before the courts: Clifford, seen in a court sketch, today entered not guilty pleas to all 11 counts . He is accused of further offences against three girls aged 15 to 18 between 1974 and 1979, and molesting a further three teenagers aged 16 to 19 between 1980 and 1985. The prosecutor said three of the assault claims were ‘specimen charges’, but the ‘behaviour occurred on numerous occasions’. She said Clifford would face five to six years’ imprisonment if he was found guilty of all the charges. At the end of the 12-minute hearing, chief magistrate Howard Riddle said: ‘Mr Clifford, you know the allegations against you; you are sent for trial at Southwark Crown Court.’ He was released on conditional bail to appear at a preliminary hearing on June 12. He is banned from contacting his alleged victims or having any unsupervised contact with anyone aged under 18. He must also sleep each night at his home address. Asked after the hearing if he was a victim of a witch hunt – a reference to a comment he made himself last month about the Jimmy Savile investigation – Clifford said: ‘That is not for me to say – you make your own mind up. 'Nightmare': Clifford was mobbed by the press after pulling up outside Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London . Under the spotlight: The publicist and his wife were escorted into the building by police officers . All I know is that nobody had ever said anything about me at all before the Jimmy Savile situation. This is a nightmare for myself and my family and has been since December, when I was arrested in a very, very public way, and all of my accusers remain anonymous. ‘What I have got to do now is to clear my name. These allegations are totally without foundation.’ Clifford added: ‘My lawyers have only just been told who [my accusers] are. Since December, I have been in the dark and anonymous people have made accusations from a long, long time ago. ‘I am going to prove these allegations are without foundation.’ After being charged, Clifford said: ‘I have never indecently assaulted anyone in my life.’ He was arrested in connection with Operation Yewtree, the police inquiry set up after Savile was exposed as a paedophile. There are three strands to Yewtree – two involving Savile, and a third termed ‘Others’. Clifford falls into this third category, meaning he was not questioned in connection with Savile. Publicist to the stars: Clifford, seen making his way out of the court in central London, represented the likes of Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando in the past .

New Jersey consumer affairs officials have sued six gas stations that they claim sold fuel meant for airplanes to unsuspecting drivers who thought they were filling up their cars over two days last year. Authorities say a probe by the Office of Weights and Measures found the stations sold the fuel from December 6-8. The stations are located in the towns of North Plainfield, Trenton, Manasquan, Lawrenceville and Scotch Plains. Gas pains: New Jersey consumer affairs officials have sued six gas stations that they claim sold fuel meant for airplanes to unsuspecting drivers who thought they were filling up their cars over two days last year . Trouble at the pump: This gas station in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, was among the ones facing a lawsuit that charges it provided aviation fuel in its pumps for cars . The lawsuit announced Tuesday also names parent company Zephyr Oil, fuel distributor Pasmel and fuel transporter Lee Transport. Citing the lawsuit, the Star-Ledger newspaper reported that on December 4, Zephyr purchased about 73,000 gallons of aviation gas stored at a fuel terminal in Bayonne. That same day, Zephyr reportedly sold the fuel to Pasmel at a substantial discount in comparison to what the price of premium auto gasoline at the time. Officials say the sales were discovered . after an employee of the terminal where the fuel was being held in . Bayonne learned from a transportation driver that aviation fuel was . being delivered to the gas stations. Consequences: Aviation fuel contains toxic lead that could damage a car, which predominantly run on unleaded gasoline .

Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said in a statement to the Star-Ledger that he would seek monetary damages for anyone who could prove that their vehicle had been damaged by the bad fuel. Mr Chiesa said: 'We allege that these gas stations clearly knew, or should have known, they were selling aviation fuel that contains toxic lead, while advertising it as unleaded gasoline for motorists.' The aviation fuel contained toxic lead that could damage the vehicles, but say it doesn't appear any cars were affected.","Gas stations accused of selling aircraft fuel in pumps meant for cars .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:02 EST, 28 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:28 EST, 28 May 2013 . An Oregon teen accused of planning an assault on his high school wrote detailed plans to 'shoot and throw bombs throughout the school,' then kill himself before engaging with responding police officers, according to court documents released Tuesday. Police say the plans were written in notebooks that were found hidden beneath the floorboards in the teen's bedroom, along with two pipe bombs, two Molotov cocktails and at least two Drano bombs. Grant Acord, 17, made his first court appearance by video transmission Tuesday but did not enter a plea on charges that include attempted aggravated murder and six counts each of unlawful possession and manufacture of a destructive device. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Accused: This is the mugshot of Grant Alan, 17, who allegedly planned to 'shoot and throw bombs throughout the school,' in an attack reminiscent of the Columbine school shooting . Wearing a light-gray sweatshirt and sweatpants with shaggy brown hair covering most of his forehead, Acord said little but replied 'yes, your honor' to questions from Judge Matthew Donohue, who set bail at $2 million. Acord's writings included 'multiple versions of the plans and diagrams to commit an attack' on West Albany High School, according to a probable cause affidavit signed by Albany Police Detective Mike Wood. In one, labeled The (Loosely Stated) 'Plan' AKA Worst case Scenario, the teen lays out an itinerary for an attack: Leave home at 7:30, go to first period, then retreat to the parking lot to prepare. At about 11:10, he would begin blasting music from the car while walking toward the school, a napalm firebomb in one hand and a duffel bag in the other. 'Drop duffel. Light and throw napalm, unzip bag and begin firing,' the notebook said. 'Cooly state: ''the Russian grim reaper is here."" The line is apparently a reference to the 2003 film Bad Boys II. The plan went on: 'Throw a smoke bomb prior to walking in. Proceed to enter the school, then shoot and throw bombs throughout the school. Kill myself before S.W.A.T. engages me.' The detective wrote that the notebooks indicate that Acord 'compares himself to both Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,' the teenagers who killed 13 people at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 before turning their guns on themselves. Police said they found printouts of a website listing the weapons used by the shooters at Columbine High School and a list of items to use in an attack, including a black trenchcoat, a belt with skull and crossbones buckle, wool socks, various explosive devices and a propane tank. Several items were listed on a page titled I NEED. They include explosive materials, ammunition, a Hi-Point 995 rifle and a Mossberg 500 pump-action shotgun. The prosecutor declined to say whether police found firearms in the home. Also allegedly found in Acord's diary were diagrams to commit the attack and plans to kill himself before SWAT team can take him out . On Monday, Acord's mother, Marianne Fox, issued a statement through a Corvallis lawyer, Alan Lanker, saying the teenager struggles with a rare form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. 'I grieve for my son, but understand and support the efforts of law enforcement to keep our beloved community safe,' the statement said. 'This is a challenging and confusing time for everyone who knows Grant.' On Monday, the 17-year-old's mother, Marianne Fox, released a statement . through her attorney attributing her son's alleged acts to his struggle . with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder (PANDAS) - a rare . disorder caused by the body's immune reaction to a streptococcus . infection. According to the PANDAS Network, the key trait for the disorder is . sudden acute and debilitating onset of intense anxiety and mood . liability accompanied by OCD symptoms or tics. Target: Police say Acord planned an attack on West Albany High School modeled after the deadly 1999 Columbine school shooting . The organization claims that there is no clear diagnostic criteria for PANDAS, . which is related to several areas of medicine, and many pediatricians . are reluctant to diagnose it because they have never seen or heard of . PANDAS before. Attorney Alan Lanker, who represents Acord's mother, said that the teen . received treatment for his condition, but said that he was not . familiar's with the details of the boy's medical history. 'He's very mentally ill. He has PANDAS. It's a brain infection that's . causing a mental illness. It's been their concern for some time,' Lanker . said. Neighbors who live near Marianne Fox and her son told NBC News that . Acord was a 'quiet young man' and did not stand out in any way. OregonLive.com reported Tuesday that Beth Maloney, who wrote a book about PANDAS called Saving Sammy, said that Marianne Fox has consulted with her since 2011 about her son's condition. 'She called me desperate for help,' Maloney said. According to the author, Fox told her that Grant's academic skills had deteriorated since the onset of the illness, and the teen was showing signs of OCD, anxiety and depression. Maloney said the 17-year-old had been prescribed antibiotics, but his mother wanted to pursue more extensive therapy and was in the process of finding a health insurance that would cover the treatment when he was arrested last week. The 17-year-old suspect, who has been held in a juvenile detention . center since his arrest, is expected to appear in court later today to . be charged as an adult with attempted murder and other counts. Also on Tuesday, students at West Albany High School resumed classes . after a four-day holiday weekend, with extra security officers on hand . to address any lingering fears regarding the alleged plot. ‘I have been advised that none of the evidence developed thus far . suggests any broader conspiracy or involvement by any other persons,’ school superintendent Maria Delapoer said in a letter to parents, . according to the Albany Democrat-Herald. Search: Bomb squads, pictured,fond six bombs at Acord's home . Secret compartment: The student at West Albany High School allegedly hid at least six bombs and bomb-making material in a secret compartment under the floor of his bedroom . Earlier this week, Acord's friends . have spoken out about how they should have been more suspicious when the . teen started talking to them about the materials that one needs to . build a bomb. 'He was . just, just kind of randomly came up to us and started talking about the . different materials that you need to make a bomb,' Thomas Stone told . local ABC affiliate KATU. 'You . know, I didn't think much of it 'cause he's kind of a strange kid, so I . wasn't surprised he had some strange hobbies, you know?' Another . friend said that the relaxed way in which the issue came up didn't tip . them off to the fact that they should think of it as a sign of a darker . plan of action. 'It wasn't like '""Oh, I'm making bombs, I'm gonna blow stuff up,""' classmate Keegan Boggs told KATU. 'It . was just talking about it, like something that you wouldn't really . think like ""Oh, he's gonna blow something up. Like a school.""' He also had 'plans checklists, . diagrams, inspirations, sources and a focus on recreating the model of . Columbine, with adjustments that would make it more successful,' according to Benton County District Attorney John Haroldson. The 1999 massacre in Littleton, Colorado, . which was carried out by two Columbine High School seniors, Eric Harris . and Dylan Klebold, left 13 dead and 21 others wounded. All clear: The Oregon Bomb Squad searched the school twice with K-9 dogs, but no explosives were found inside . 'This was a very methodical process,' Haroldson said. 'He took time to even get to this point.' Police have not yet pinpointed a motive for Acord's plot. Attorney . Mr Haroldson said he wasn't aware that the teen was having trouble at . school, or being bullied. He was described as quiet and a loner by other . students, though one student said he seemed like 'a pretty nice guy.' 'In . any case that you have a young person that in essence plans to take a . video game approach to killing people at school, you have to take a . close look at the mental health issues,' he said. 'And the process will . certainly provide for that once he's represented by counsel.' The teen will be arraigned later today as an . adult on one count of aggravated attempted murder and six counts each . of manufacturing a destructive device, possession of a destructive . device and possession of a weapon with intent to use it against another . person. According to KPTV - FOX 12, police accompanied by K-9 dogs found no . bombs during two searches of West Albany High, which is about 75 miles . south of Portland. Acord was taken into custody just before . 10.30pm Thursday at his mother's home in the 2400 block of Northwest . Violet Street in West Albany after police discovered six explosives . hidden under the floorboards. Officers who searched the premises for evidence also uncovered a detailed plan, checklists, a diagram of Acord's school and a timetable for when he allegedly planned to carry out a mass murder using bombs and gunfire, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported. 'This is beyond a kid playing with a . couple of cherry bombs. It was serious enough to warrant calling out the . bomb squad,' Albany police Capt. Eric Carter told KATU-TV in Portland. Grave charges: Grant Acord, 17, was arrested in Oregon on suspicion that he plotted to bomb his high school using six homemade explosives . Adult: The teen will be arraigned Tuesday as an adult on one count of aggravated attempted murder and six counts each of manufacturing a destructive device, possession of a destructive device and possession of a weapon with intent to use it against another person . Search: Bomb squads searched Accord home, pictured, and the school for explosives . Students at West Albany High School are shocked after hearing of the foiled bomb plot. 'I'm just shocked because you hear about it at other schools and other places around the world, but you never really think it's going to happen,' high school junior Keagan Boggs told KPTV.com. Senior Dennis Reilly said: 'I'd say ""hi"" to him in the hallway because I was kind of like I should probably talk to this kid, make sure he feels OK. So, I talked to him sometimes, and he seems like a pretty nice guy.'","Grant Acord, 17, being held on $2 million bail .

Ministers resisting to billions of pounds in budget cuts will be shamed into explaining themselves to a medieval-style Star Chamber. Chancellor George Osborne will convene the panel of senior figures who have agreed a fresh round of spending cuts to put pressure on those grill the departments who refuse to fall into line. One of those likely to face the Star Chamber, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, today signalleed that he is ready to block cuts which threaten Britain’s ‘military capabilities’ risking a new Whitehall stand-off with the Treasury. Star Chamber: Ministers who refuse to sign up to new spending cuts will be dragged to face Cabinet colleagues to explain themselves in at a hearing modeller on the Medieval courts which held the rich and powerful to account . Write caption here . Ministers have been told to help find £11.5billion in extra savings for 2015-16. So far he has raised of £2.5billion, after seven departments including justice, energy and the Foreign Office signed off cuts of up to 10 per cent. But big spending ministers, including Mr Hammond, Home Secretary Theresa May, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson are resisting demands for the deepest  cuts. They all faced being hauled before the . Star Chamber – officially called the PEX Cabinet Committee – to be . cross-examined by ministers who have already settled their budgets with . the Treasury. Mr Osborne . insisted he would not let ministers ‘off the hook’ by calling for more . benefits cuts instead of adjusting their own spending. At risk: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned Britain's 'military capabilities' would be at risk if Treasury demands for cuts went beyond efficiency savings . But Mr Hammond risked the ire of the . Chancellor when he refused to offer cuts to the armed forces beyond . efficiency savings in the way the Ministry of Defence is run. Mr . Hammond said: ‘We can look for efficiency savings, which everybody . should be seeking all the time and however many times you've done it you . can always go back and have another look. The threat of the Star Chamber for ministers who refuse to sign up to cuts is real - and has worked in the past. In 2010, George Osborne warned those dragging their feet that they would be grilled by Cabinet colleagues and they all fell into line. This time tensions are higher and ministers who agreed cuts last time are not more reluctant. The idea of a Star Chamber dates back to the 15th Century, and was a court of justice which sat in the Palace of Westminster. It took its name from stars painted on the ceiling of the room built during the rein of King Edward II. It was made up of Privy Councillors and judges and sat in judgement on people considered too powerful and prominent to be dealt with by ordinary courts. It sat in secret with no witnesses, and was often used and abused by the monarchy to target enemies. Mr Osborne's Star Chamber, more dryly named the PEX Cabinet Committee . The Star Chamber will meet in the Cabinet Office Conference Room. A source said: ‘The room was purpose . built as the Treasury board room in the 1750s. 'Throughout its history, . the role of the Treasury Board has been to approve expenditure, grants, . fines and taxes.' ‘But we should be very clear that there is a difference between efficiency savings, which may be difficult to achieve but are painless in terms of the impact on the front line, and output cuts, which are of a very different order and require proper and mature consideration across government about the impact that they will have on our military capabilities.’ He said he was ready to have an ‘adult conversation’ about ‘what we reasonably can do’ in terms of efficiency savings in his department. The Treasury hopes that just the threat of having to appear at the Star Chamber will embarrass ministers into agreeing cuts. During the 2010 Spending Review all government departments chose to settle their budgets rather than be grilled by Cabinet colleagues. But the negotiations have been more fraught this time round, with some ministers angry that they are being cut again while the NHS, international aid, defence equipment and schools budgets remain protected. Each Cabinet minister is expected to agree their cuts with the Treasury directly. Those that refuse will have to appear in front of the PEX Cabinet Committee, which is chaired by Mr Osborne and Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Yesterday it emerged that seven departments had agreed cuts worth £1billion, including the Ministry of Justice, Department for Communities and Local Government, Foreign Office, Department for Energy and Climate Change, Northern Ireland Office, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office. The cuts amount to almost 10 per cent of their combined budgets, higher than the eight per cent targeted by the spending review as a whole. As a result the minister in charge - Ed Davey, Chris Grayling, William Hague, Francis Maude, Eric Pickles and Theresa Villliers – have been invited to join the Star Chamber. Ken Clarke and Oliver Letwin have also been invited to join. It is expected to meet at least twice in the final weeks of the spending review, before Mr Osborne makes a statement to Parliament on June 26. The Chancellor is understood to be delighted that seven departments have already signed off savings of up to 10 per cent, including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles who were reported to be resisting cuts. A Treasury source said: 'We are impress by Eric and Chris. Clearly these are ministers who have put their money where their mouth is and are very serious about making sure every penny of taxpayers' money is spent effectively.' Praise: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles have been invited to join the Star Chamber after 'putting their money where their mouth is' to agree to cuts of up to 10 per cent . However, Mr Osborne has made clear to other ministers yet to settle cuts will that he will not be diverted by calls for more benefits cuts. The benefits cap, announced last year limiting increases in working age benefits to one per cent, is already due to raise £3.4billion in 2015-16. Mr Osborne said: 'We are cutting welfare and we’re cutting welfare for the future as well. ‘We’re going to make sure that no family that stays at home on benefits gets more than the average family going out to work and we’re also making sure that welfare bills don’t go up faster than wages, so there are big savings in welfare. ‘But I would also say that’s not an excuse to let Whitehall off the hook. 'We’ve also got to make savings there so we can fix our economy, bring that deficit down and spend on the things people want us to spend on like the NHS, like the infrastructure that’s going to create jobs in the future.’ Several Tory ministers have called for deeper cuts to benefits to help balance the books.","George Osborne invites ministers who have agreed to cuts to sit in judgement on colleagues .

These two tiny rock figurines thought to have been worth just £200 have stunned the art world after selling for a staggering £180,000. The 2ins long pieces of two Chinese boys playing with a dog and a drum were carved out of agate stone and thought to date back to the 19th century. They were offered for sale by an unnamed English antiques dealer who was told to expect to receive between £200 to £300 for the pair. Windfall: The two Chinese figurines which were expected to fetch between £200 and £300 but went on to sell for £180,000 . But auctioneers began to suspect they had underpriced the pieces when they became inundated with inquiries from the Far East after the sales catalogue was published. The Woolley and Wallis auction rooms in Salisbury, Wilts, was packed out with bidders, mostly from China, and all of their telephone lines were also taken up. The saleroom held its breath as the bidding quickly went from three to four figure sums before reaching £50,000 in no time at all. As bidders dropped out, it came down to two interested parties over the phone and they took the price into six figures. The hammer came down on £150,000 but with all the fees added on the overall price paid was £180,000 - 900 times the original estimate. The agate carvings went to an anonymous buyer from China who bid online. Naturally, the seller was said to have been delighted with the price but the auctioneers remain stumped by the fee paid. It . is believed the pieces date back to earlier than was thought and the . two wealthy bidders were so determined to buy them they were happy to . pay whatever it took. Gone for a song: Last year this 900-year-old Song dynasty dish sold for a record-breaking £17million at auction in Hong Kong, after after sparking a fierce bidding war between eight desperate buyers . The single lot symbolises the frenzied interest that currently exists in ancient Oriental antiques as the newly-rich Chinese go about buying back their heritage. Auctioneer John Axford said: 'I can only assume the figures are far older than we estimated, with such tiny items it's very difficult to assign an age.' John Berwald, a London-based expert dealer in Oriental art and antiques, said: 'It is a hell of a price. 'Chinese agate carvings date back to the 17th century. 'One can only assume that these pieces are much earlier in date, probably from the 18th century. 'Chinese agate carvings of boys are extremely rare, so that was also another factor in it. 'But if two people want an item enough and are happy to pay whatever it takes, then you can get these hugely inflated prices.' Newly wealthy Chinese collectors have driven the prices of ceramics and antiquities to astonishing levels in recent years.

Ill-timed: Keith Hernandez made the 'honest mistake' when he referred to a broken bat as a 'dead soldier' A Mets announcer has sparked outrage after insensitively referring to a broken bat as a 'dead soldier' on Memorial Day. Former Major League Baseball player Keith Hernandez used the term - which is commonly used in baseball to describe shattered bats - as he was commentating on a game, while the nation paid tribute to fallen service personnel. His slip of the tongue prompted anger from viewers, who took to Twitter branding his comment 'inappropriate', 'insensitive' and 'ill-timed'. A SNY spokesperson said they would talk to the commentator, who was talking during the New York Mets' game, which saw them win 2-1 over the New York Yankees. 'We'll address the matter with Keith,' they told the NY Daily News. 'It was an honest mistake and a poor choice of words.' Hernandez, who began playing for the Mets in 1983, made the thoughtless comment when Daniel Murphy's bat splintered against Phil Hughes in the first inning. He said: 'Well, that is a dead soldier right there, folks, laying in that infield dirt. 'This is... ouch. That’s what you call getting sawed off.' Later on in the game, player Vernon Wells broke his bat on a pitch - but this time the commentator did not mention the splintered bat, Larry Brown Sports reported. The 59-year-old's reference would typically be ignored, as it is a common baseball phrase - but Memorial Day is a particularly emotional day for the country, as it gives them a chance to remember all of those who have died while in military service. The former MLB player was commenting on the New York Mets match against the New York Yankees . Military graves are customarily decorated with wreaths and flags and the occasion, which began after the Civil War, is one deeply embedded in the country's consciousness, and typically marks the beginning of summer. On his Twitter page the commentator remained silent over his indelicate phrases. The day was marked by an emotional speech by President Obama. He paid . tribute to America's fallen soldiers in a moving Memorial Day speech at . Arlington National Cemetery - as he urged the nation not to forget the . tens of thousands of troops still protecting the country in Afghanistan.

'Our troops, our military . families understand this and they mention to me whether the country . fully appreciates what is happening. Let us never forget that our nation . is still at war.' He . suggested fewer people are today touched by war due to the all-volunteer . military force and advanced technology that allows the U.S. to . accomplish some missions with far fewer personnel.

The boom is fuelled by executives who want to minimise journey times and  Russian oligarchs with cash to burn. In flight: Beechcraft, which makes the King Air turboprop (pictured), said it has seen a rise in UK deliveries . Britain now has Europe’s second largest fleet of business planes, at 503, with 369 jets and 134 turboprops. Only Germany has more, with 621 . according to research by Beechcraft Corporation, maker of the King Air . turboprop plane, based on data from NetJets, a  Warren Buffett-backed . aviation firm. Sports stars have contributed to the . effect, with Andy Murray recently hiring a plane from NetJets to fly . between Madrid and Rome. From 2007 to 2011, deliveries of new . planes to Britain soared by 47 per cent compared to the so-called ‘boom . years’ of 2002 to 2006. Economic troubles: The rise comes despite the problems the UK economy has faced since the end of last decade. People are pictured outside Northern Rock in Kingston Upon Thames, south-west London, in 2007 . Shawn Vick, president of Beechcraft . International Services Company, said demand was driven by London’s . position as a financial hub and the country’s ‘culture of savvy . entrepreneurial people’, adding: ‘These aircraft give them rapid access . to new markets.’ He said that Europe ‘remains a big market for business aviation and it continues to grow’. The use of private planes by board . members at publicly listed companies has riled small investors, but Mr . Vick said it was wrong to see them as a perk. Growth fluctuations: Beechcraft said that 232 aircraft were delivered to customers in Britain between 2007 and 2011 - up 47 per cent on the so-called boom years of 2002 to 2006 . He said: ‘Shareholders should not be complaining as you can be far more productive. ‘I’ve tried visiting four countries in Europe over two days on scheduled . aircraft. One delay and it becomes impossible. With a business . aircraft, I can do it in one day.’ Pugh . NetJets, which offers rental or part-ownership, said demand for shares in its planes is growing. Top models include the Gulfstream . G550, Dassault Falcon, Hawker 400 and Cessna Citation XLS – the world’s . best-selling  business jet. Marine Eugene, European sales . director of NetJets, said: ‘A lot of these aircraft will be . replacements, with deliveries the result of orders from 2005, 2006 and . 2007. ‘Also, a lot of the aircraft . delivered to the UK and registered there won’t be flying in the UK, . they’ll be flying in Russia – a market that has taken off in recent . years with the increasing number of billionaires.’ Britain’s busiest airport for private . planes last year was Luton, famously linked to cockney actress Lorraine . Chase. It handled 12,371 flights, about half as many as leader . Paris-Le-Bourget, with 24,412. Geneva was second with 17,824 flights and Nice third at 14,091. Chartering a private plane such as a . Cessna Citation for an overnight return for five people between  London . City Airport and Frankfurt in Germany would cost approximately £10,000. Return flights from London to Paris could cost from £4,700 to £27,000 depending on the plane. A less conspicuous way to fly privately is ‘jet cards’, where clients buy a 25-hour block of flight time.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:51 EST, 29 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 29 May 2013 . Deal: Sgt. Robert Bales' lawyer said that he will be pleading guilty in an effort to avoid the death penalty, which the U.S. Army was seeking in his case after he reportedly killed 16 Afghan villagers in a predawn rampage in March . The Army staff sergeant charged with slaughtering 16 villagers during one of the worst atrocities of the Afghanistan war has agreed to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty. Staff Sgt. Robert Bales is scheduled to enter guilty pleas to charges of premeditated murder June 5 at Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Seattle, his lawyer John Henry Browne told The Associated Press on Wednesday. A sentencing-phase trial set for September will determine whether he is sentenced to life in prison with or life without the possibility of parole. The judge and commanding general must approve a plea deal. Browne previously indicated Bales remembered little from the night of the massacre, but he said the soldier will give a full account of what happened before the judge decides whether to accept the plea. In earlier interviews, Bales' lawyer argues that the Army was pushing the possibility of the death penalty. 'The Army is not taking . responsibility for Sgt. Bales and other soldiers that the Army knowingly . sends into combat situations with diagnosed PTSD, concussive head . injuries and other injuries,' Browne said. 'The . Army is trying to take the focus off the failure of its decisions, and . the failure of the war itself, and making Sgt. Bales out to be a rogue . soldier.' Bales, an Ohio native and father of two, slipped away from his remote southern Afghanistan outpost at Camp Belambay early on March 11, 2012, and attacked Afghan compounds in two slumbering villages nearby. Changing tales: Bales' lawyer says the army should take greater responsibility for sending soldiers into combat who are suffering from PTSD and head injuries, but now he seems grateful for the plea deal . Most of the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were piled and burned. The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan. Bales was serving his fourth tour in a combat zone, and the allegations against him raised questions about the toll multiple deployments were taking on American troops. For that reason, many legal experts believed it that it was unlikely that he would receive the death penalty, as Army prosecutors were seeking. Adding to that, the military justice system hasn't executed anyone since 1961. The plea deal could inflame tensions in Afghanistan as relatives of the victims in Kandahar became outraged at the notion Bales might escape the death penalty and even vowed revenge. Bodies of Afghan civilians, allegedly shot by US soldier Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, loaded into the back of a van in Alkozai village of Panjwayi district, Kandahar province . 'For this one thing, we would kill 100 American soldiers,' said Mohammed Wazir, who had 11 family members killed that night, including his mother and 2-year-old daughter. 'A prison sentence doesn't mean anything,' said Said Jan, whose wife and three other relatives died. 'I know we have no power now. But I will become stronger, and if he does not hang, I will have my revenge.' Three of Jan's other family members were wounded, including his 7-year-old granddaughter, who was shot in the head. Bales' wife, Kari Bales, said in a . statement Wednesday that she and their children have been enjoying their . weekend visits with Bales at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, and she hopes he . receives an impartial trial. 'I no longer know if a fair trial for Bob is possible, but it very much is my hope, and I will have faith,' she said.","Bales is accused of murdering 16 Afghan villagers, included nine children .

Two million customers fed up at poor treatment from banks and insurers took their cases to the Financial Ombudsman in the past year –  a rate of one every six seconds. The service went on to investigate a record 500,000 complaints and ordered payouts to nearly 250,000 consumers. Of those complaints taken up by the Ombudsman in the financial year to April, 378,699 were about payment protection insurance. Two million customers fed up at poor treatment from banks and insurers took their cases to the Financial Ombudsman in the past year . This figure was double that of the previous 12 months, according to its annual review. Chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney said dissatisfaction had hit ‘record levels’. ‘People are becoming more aware of their rights and less willing to put up with poor customer service,’ she said. ‘Too many financial businesses still seem unable to sort out problems themselves, without the Ombudsman  having to get involved.’ The high volume of complaints about PPI suggests banks are failing to clear a backlog which has built up over several years. They are struggling to process refunds for millions of consumers mis-sold policies they did not need alongside loans and credit cards. The scandal has led to an estimated bill of £15billion for lenders after they were ordered in 2010 to pay back premiums. The Ombudsman settles disputes between firms and customers, and a complaint would reach officials only after being rejected by a bank. The Ombudsman settles disputes between firms and customers, and a complaint would reach officials only after being rejected by a bank . Its annual report is another setback for banks, which have been mired in scandal since the 2008 credit crunch. Justin Modray, founder of financial advice website Candid Money, said: ‘Financial giants prove time and again they’re little more than shady salesmen masquerading as  pillars of society, who routinely reject complaints they’re subsequently forced to settle. 'Continued financial mis-selling, coupled with an increasing willingness to complain, means the latest Ombudsman figures are sadly no surprise. ‘The regulator needs to get far tougher by nipping bad practices in the bud, rather than relying on the Ombudsman to sort out the mess  further down the line.’ The report also showed a huge rise in the number of pensioners turning to the Ombudsman as a last resort. The over-65s accounted for a quarter of cases investigated – double the figure for 2011-12. However, more consumers are side-stepping claims management firms, which typically grab around 25 per cent of any compensation won. Miss Ceeney said growing numbers were ‘realising they don’t need to pay someone to make a complaint on  their behalf’. The Big Four banking groups still dominate complaints. RBS/NatWest, Lloyds Banking Group (including HBOS),  Barclays and HSBC accounted for 62 per cent of  complaints to the service, up from 52 per cent in the previous period. Leading institutions are still trying to recover from a string of high-profile scandals over the last year.RBS/NatWest suffered an IT system meltdown which left customers without access to their cash for weeks. Bankers at Barclays and its rivals were strongly implicated in the interest-rate rigging furore while HSBC was reprimanded for links to money laundering by Mexican drug barons. A spokesman for the British Bankers Association said: ‘All banks have hired more staff to deal with complaints.’ He criticised some ‘unscrupulous’ claims management firms for referring ‘large  numbers of claims to the Ombudsman, whether there are grounds to or not’. This ‘clogs up the system, meaning that people with genuine complaints don’t always get the service they deserve’.

The Tory party under David Cameron is now more divided than when John Major was leader, a devastating new opinion poll reveals today. Mr Cameron’s grip on his party has been weakened in recent weeks after public splits over Europe, gay marriage and public spending. Divided parties rarely prosper in elections and two thirds of voters now believe the Prime Minister lacks the skills needed to win in 2015. Split: David Cameron is on holiday in Ibiza but back home voters think the Tory party is now more divided thasn when John Major was Prime Minister in the 1990s . Poll: Labour's lead has been slashed to just four points in the latest ComRes poll, which puts UKIP on a record high of 17 points . Mr Cameron remains on holiday in Ibiza this week, but when MPs return from their latest recess Tory unrest is expected to re-emerge. More than half of voters (56 per cent) now believe that Conservative divisions run deeper than when John Major saw his party disintegrate in the mid-1990s. Worryingly for Mr Cameron, the splits which undermined Sir John’s government were fuelled by disagreement over Europe. Voters believe Mr Cameron lacks leadership skills needed to win the 2015 while the Tory party is split . The Prime Minister sought to quell mutiny in Tory ranks with the promise of an in-out Europe referendum, after negotiating a  ‘fresh settlement’ with Brussels. But 114 Tory MPs voted to express ‘regret’ that the referendum was not included in the Queen’s Speech. In an unprecedented move, the Prime Minister has told his MPs they must scrap constituency meetings to vote through a Bill being launched by backbench Tory MP James Wharton. Mr Wharton has adopted a private members’ bill that has been drawn up by Tory high command because the Lib Dems refused to allow it to be presented as a government Bill. It promises a referendum by the end of 2017 following a renegotiation of Britain’s role in Brussels. The tougher stance on Europe comes as Tories scrabble to deal with the threat posed by the UK Independence Party. In the latest opinion poll by ComRes for The Independent, support for UKIP has climbed to a record high of 17 per cent, up four points on last month. The Tories are on 30 per cent, just four points behind Labour on 34 per cent. The Lib Dems are on 10 per cent. Worryingly for Mr Cameron, 72 per cent of UKIP voters believe the Tory party is more split now than under John Major, along with 59 per cent of Conservative voters. Almost two thirds of voters (61 per cent) do not think that Mr Cameron ‘has the leadership qualities required to win a majority at the next general election in 2015’. It includes 30 per cent of Conservative voters and 86 per cent of UKIP supporters.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:57 EST, 22 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:20 EST, 29 May 2013 . Rules forcing descendants of George II to ask the monarch for permission to tie the knot are to be torn up. David Cameron and Boris Johnson are among those related to the former King whose weddings are technically ‘void’ if they failed to ask Buckingham Palace if they could tie the knot. Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the 240-year-old law was ‘unworkable’ as he set out plans to shake-up rules governing succession to the throne. But he was accused of opening a 'Royal Pandora's box'. Relative values: London Mayor Boris Johnson and PM David Cameron are both descendants of George II who needed to ask the monarch for permission to tie the knot . Legislation will end discrimination against future female royals so that men will no longer take precedence over women in the order of succession. It will also end the bar on heirs marrying Roman Catholics if they want to keep their entitlement to the throne. Under the 1772 Royal Marriages Act any descendent of George II must seek the reigning monarch’s consent before marrying – without which their marriage is void, Mr Clegg told the Commons. ‘This law – passed 240 years ago – is clearly now unworkable: George II’s descendants number in their hundreds; many will be unaware of this arcane requirement; many will have only a tenuous link to the Royal family.’ Among those descendants are the Prime Minister and the London Mayor. Under the 1772 Royal Marriages Act, descendants of King George II could not marry without the agreement of the crown . George II was Mr Cameron’s great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather. However it is thought that because the PM is a descendent of an illegitimate daughter of William IV, who was George II's grandson, his claim to the throne is invalid and he may not have needed to seek permission to marry. Mr . Johnson is a descendant of Adelheid, Baroness de Pfeffel  the . illegitimate daughter of Prince Paul of Württemberg whose great-great . grandfather was George II. The 1772 Act warns that ‘every marriage of any such descendant, without such consent, shall be null and void’. Mr Clegg told MPs that new legislation ‘proposes that the monarch need only consent to the marriages of the first six individuals in the line of succession – without which they would lose their place’. He added: ‘That way we retain the tradition of monarchical consent, but, in limiting it to the people who could – feasibly – assume the throne it will be applied in a much more reasonable way.’ The rules of succession are being changed so the baby of the Duke and . Duchess of Cambridge will become monarch, even if it is a girl who later . has younger brothers . The measure is buried in the Succession to the Crown Bill which will clear the way for the baby of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to take the throne, whether it’s a boy or a girl. Commonwealth countries have cleared the way for the rule change, which will mean the royal couple’s first child, expected in July, can become monarch even if it is a girl who later has younger brothers. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg complained that the changes were being rushed through with the urgency of terror legislation . Mr Clegg said: ‘The current rules of succession belong to a bygone era. They reflect old prejudices and old fears. ‘Today . we don't support laws which discriminate on either religious or gender . grounds, they have no place in modern Britain and certainly not in our . monarchy, an institution central to our constitution, to the . Commonwealth and to our national identity too.’ The current rules were based on ‘supposed superiority of men’, Mr Clegg said. However he was bombarded by questions in the Commons on technicalities and unintended consequences of the Bill, including how titles like the Duke of Cornwall – held by Prince Charles – will be passed on in future. Mr Clegg was accused of opening a 'Royal Pandora's box'. Critics of the Bill also complained that major constitutional changes were being rushed through the Commons with just two days for debate. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Bill was being ‘treated as if it was terrorism legislation’ and it was an ‘insult to the nation and to our sovereign and indeed to Parliament’. The Prince of Wales has also reportedly raised concerns about the legislation with a senior Government official. In a meeting with Richard Heaton, permanent secretary of the Cabinet Office, the Prince voiced worries about what will happen if his grandchild marries a Catholic, the Daily Mail reported earlier this month. It is assumed any children born to a future royal and their Catholic partner would be brought up as Catholics. But this could ultimately lead to the constitutional crisis of a future king or queen being barred from the throne because they are a Catholic - something which is still outlawed.","240-year-old law to be scrapped which means weddings of relatives of George II were 'void' if permission was not granted .

Twitter fans said that Hawk-Eye - a computer system used in tennis and cricket to track the ball's trajectory and can be used to aid the adjudication process - was now redundant in comparison to the quick-thinking Ukrainian. Stakhovsky said he had pulled a similar stunt during the . clay-court tournament at Munich last month.

At a clay event in Rome this month another professional, Viktor Troicki of Serbia, ushered a TV cameraman out onto the court to get video evidence of a ball mark he was sure showed a call was incorrect. 'I saw that,' Stakhovsky said, then offered a critique of the camerawork on that occasion, saying the angle was all wrong: 'They came from the side, so you couldn't see the mark.' Gasquet, for his part, agreed the call Monday was quite close and said he wasn't bothered a bit by Stakhovsky's antics. 'It's funny. It's not a problem,' Gasquet said. 'He's a funny guy. 'I think he's one of the funniest guys in the draw. For sure, it's not usual to see that, but I can understand he's frustrated.' The row between player and umpire is the latest in a string of heated arguments in tennis history. In 1981 John McInroe had a famous outburst after becoming infuriated at an umpire's decision. After his first-round match at Wimbledon against Tom Gullikson, McEnroe was fined $1,500 and was nearly ejected after rowing with umpire Ted James, swearing at tournament referee Fred Hoyles and shouting 'you cannot be serious' after he disagreed with their call. In 1995 Jeff Tarango was playing in a third round match in Wimbledon against Alexander Mronz.He became became infuriated with umpire Bruno Rebeuh, who had ruled against him on several occasions. As the crowd heckled Tarango he told them to 'shut up' which led to Rebeuh giving him a code violation to Tarango, claiming the phrase was an audible obscenity. Tarango called for Rebeuh to be removed but he was told to play one - to which he responded by accusing Rebeuh of being 'o'ne of the most corrupt officials in the game' - to this Rebeuh gave Tarango another code violation, this time for unsportsmanlike conduct. Tarango then stormed off the court.","Sergiy Stakhovsky, of Ukraine, put down racket to take photo of mark in clay .

Italy's new government vowed to make protecting women from violence a priority on the same day as the funeral of a 16-year-old girl allegedly killed by her boyfriend took place. MPs in the country's chamber of deputies unanimously voted to pass the Council of Europe's convention on violence against women as Fabiana Luzzi, whose death caused national outrage, was mourned by residents of Corigliano Calbro in southern Italy. The teenager was allegedly stabbed to death by her 17-year-old boyfriend last week then doused in petrol and set alight while she is thought to have still been alive. Victim: Fabiana Luzzi was allegedly stabbed to death by her boyfriend in Italy last week. Her death added urgency to a parliamentary vote which saw Italian MPs prioritise action against gender-based violence . The schoolgirl's death gave the parliamentary vote an increased urgency and followed a lengthy MPs debate, according to The Guardian. Equal opportunities minister Josefa Idem said that the convention is a positive step in trying to curb violence against women. According to The Guardian, she said on a visit to Corigliano: 'Faced with Fabiana's death, I reaffirm the commitment of all the government and my ministry to make the fight against gender-based violence a key point of this legislature. 'I feel the need to ask forgiveness from her and all the women killed by the hand of those who abuse the word love. Poignant: Mourners gathered to remember murdered Fabiana Luzzi in Italy on the same day that politicians debated violence against women . 'The state must be more effective in this commitment (and) be even closer to the victims.' Widespread problem: According to figures released in 2011, as many as one in three women in Italy are subjected to domestic violence . Women's campaign group Casa della Donne claims that at least 51 women have been murdered in Italy so far this year, but with no official statistics, they believe the figure could actually be three times that. The group praised the Italian government for ratifying the convention - known as the Istanbul Convention - but added that it must ensure that its measures are thoroughly followed through. According to statistics from Istat published in 2011, around one in three Italian women are victims of domestic violence. The UN urged the country to tackle the problem after a visit from a special rapporteur last year. As well as Fabiana's murder last week, a 50-year-old woman, Silvana Cassol, was shot by her husband, who then shot himself, in Padua, and a 35-year-old Romanian woman, Angelica Timis, was allegedly stabbed and killed by her former partner near Milan. Although 25 countries, including Britain, have signed the Istanbul Convention, the convention needs the ratification of ten including eight Council of Europe member states.

Apology: Ukrainian ballet star Sergei Polunin said his shock exit from the production of Midnight Express was down to a 'health issue' Speaking at a press conference today, Polunin said: 'The only thing I can say is there was a health issue and I couldn’t say anything at that time.' He added: 'I apologise to the audience because I couldn’t even explain at that time.' Asked if he could explain now, he said: 'Not yet, maybe one day I will.' Polunin, who has performed in Russia since April, said: 'In Russia it’s great because you can concentrate 100 per cent on your work. There are not as many distractions as London or in the West.' Schaufuss said he was 'delighted' Polunin was coming back to the London stage and described him as a great dancer. 'Bad boy': The 23-year-old dancer is seen in action on stage in a Royal Ballet production of Sleeping Beauty in 2011 . Asked if the pair had made up, Polunin said he was not 'friends' with Schaufuss, but said they had a professional relationship. He said: 'I always respect Peter as a dancer and as a director, we’ve never made friends, but I still respect him. 'I think it’s important for professionals to do work even if you don’t become friends.' Asked about his reputation as the bad boy of ballet, Polunin said: 'It’s not being bad, it’s just trying to find yourself.'","Sergei Polunin walked out on production in April ahead of London premiere .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 11:13 EST, 29 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:16 EST, 29 May 2013 . An Italian professor said on Wednesday he has identified what he believes is the world's oldest complete scroll of the Torah, containing the full text of the first five books of Hebrew scripture. Mauro Perani, professor of Hebrew at the University of Bologna, said experts and carbon dating tests done in Italy and the United States dated the scroll as having been made between 1155 and 1225. The scroll, which has been in possession of the Bologna University Library for more than 100 years, had been previously thought to be from the 17th century. It had been labeled 'scroll 2'. This is the document that an Italian expert says is the oldest known complete Torah scroll . There are many fragments of the Torah that are older but not complete scrolls with all five books. 'A Jew who was a librarian at the university examined the scroll in 1889 for a catalogue and wrote '17th century followed by a question mark,'' Perani said in a telephone interview. But in preparation for a new catalogue of the university's Judaica collection, Perani, 63, studied the scroll and suspected that the librarian had made too cursory an examination in 1889 and not recognised its antiquity. The professor said he immediately recognized that it had been wrongly dated given its script and other graphic notations . The meaning of the word Torah is varied.It refers to the Five Books of Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The name - which derives from 'to teach' - can also refer to the entire Jewish bible or the whole body of Jewish law and teachings. The so-called Old Testament (the New Testament are not part of Jewish scripture) is known to the Jewish faith as the 'Written Torah' or the 'Tanakh'. The scriptures are always hand-written on scrolls. The parchment on these scrolls are not meant to be touched by humans. This is because some say because they are too holy; others say because the parchment, made from animal skins, is a source of ritual defilement; others say because the sweat from humans has acids that will damage the parchment. Instead, the text is followed with a pointer, called a Yad. Source: Judiasm 101 . 'I realised that the style of the . writing was older than the 17th century so I consulted with other . experts,' he said of the scroll, which measures 36 metres by 64 cm (39 . yards by 25 inches). He said the scroll showed many . graphical features and scribal devices that were no longer used by . copyists of Hebrew scripts in the 17th century. The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather each sewn together, most of them with three columns of script. After the experts he consulted agreed . that the scroll was probably several centuries older than previously . believed, Perani had fragments of it subjected to carbon-14 dating . tests. The tests, at the . University of Salento in southern Italy and the Radiocarbon Dating . Laboratory at the University of Illinois, dated the scroll as from the . second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th . century. The Torah, also known as the Hebrew Pentateuch, consists of the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The complete version of the Torah that was previously considered the oldest was from the late 13th century, Perani said. He said that before the scroll came into possession of the University of Bologna in the 18th or 19th century it had been in the custody of the Dominican convent in the city that is home to the world's oldest university. Tests dated the Torah (not pictured) as from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century . Perani said it was not clear where the Torah had been copied but most likely it was not in Italy. It was probably made by a copyist trained in the oriental tradition and likely done in the Middle East. Perani has for two decades been head of the Italian Genizah project, which locates and catalogues fragments of Hebrew manuscripts in Italy. Genizah is the Hebrew word for the room in a synagogue where religious books or papers are stored. The Genizah project has found, photographed and catalogued some 13,000 fragments of Jewish compositions from various branches of Talmudic literature, Biblical commentary, Jewish thought, the Hebrew language and Jewish history. For his work in Jewish studies, Perani is due to be given an honorary degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem next month.","Scroll thought to be from 17th century was made between 1155 and 1225 .

It was a miserable 44th birthday for beleaguered Toronto Mayor Rob Ford today as the political inferno surrounding his alleged crack cocaine use continued to burn. Putting on a friendly face for the massed hordes of reporters who gathered at city hall, Ford handed out slices of a football-themed cake as he was inundated with questions surrounding the resignations of key staff members and a video which allegedly shows him smoking a crack pipe. And just as his big day could not have gotten any worse, two protesters arrived with their cake for Ford wishing him a happy birthday, but also imploring him to resign. Anyone for Cake? Toronto Mayor Rob Ford brings cake from his office to offer it members of the media in celebration of his 44th birthday at City Hall in Toronto, May 28, 2013 . The two women, Jennifer Capararu and Christine Brubaker explained the acute embarrassment Ford was bringing upon Toronto by singing, 'Happy birthday, Rob Ford! Please resign, Rob Ford! Happy birthday, please resign, please resign Rob Ford.' Unfortunately for the women who had gone to the trouble of baking another cake for the embattled mayor, security did not allow them to get near to the mayor's office. The offer of cake to reporters was in stark contrast to his attitude on Friday when Ford, the mayor of Canada's largest city, took to the weekly radio show he hosts with his brother Doug Ford to reiterate that allegations he is seen smoking crack in a video that surfaced on May 16th are ridiculous. 'A bunch of maggots,"" Ford said about the reporters hounding him, quickly adding that he shouldn't have said that. Citizen Christine Brubaker holds a cake that she made for Toronto Mayor Rob Ford that reads 'Happy Birthday Rob Please Resign' on his 44th birthday at City Hall in Toronto on Tuesday . Happy Birthday?: A citizen holds a cake that she made for Toronto Mayor Rob Ford that reads ""Happy Birthday Rob Please Resign"" How Old Are You?: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford enjoyed his football-themed cake today at City Hall so much he handed it out to members of the press . Today at City Hall when asked by reporters about the video, Ford simply said, 'I can't comment.' Earlier this month, Gawker and The Toronto Star published reports and that two journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe. The Star said it did not obtain the video or pay to watch it. Gawker and the Star have said the video was shown to them by a drug dealer who had been trying to sell it for a six-figure sum. Indeed, on Monday, Gawker raised enough money from its readers, donated through crowdfunding website Indiegogo and nicknamed the 'Crackstarter Fund,' to buy the video from its owner. But later on during the day, Gawker published an update to say that they were unable to make contact with the owner. 'We have had no further contact with the people we believe to have custody of this video since the last update,' the editor of the site wrote on Indiegogo. 'Our confidence that we can consummate this transaction has diminished.' Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video given to the Globe and Mail and Gawker.com purportedly shows Ford with two men, one of whom is believed to have been murdered over the video . Fundraising: On Monday, Gawker successfully raised more than $200,000 in its 'Crackstarter' campaign to purchase the video . Facing the media: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford makes a statement to the press after the resignation of his communications aides George Christopoulos and Isaac Ransom . In fact, the murky affair surrounding what was being viewed as a comic story last week darkened with yesterday's news that one of Ford's senior staffers has now been questioned by police as a possible link to the murder of 21-year-old Anthony Smith. Sources told the Globe and Mail newspaper that police had spoken to a high-ranking official within the mayor's office as part of an 'ongoing investigation that is currently in the media.' The paper reported that the staffer reportedly told officers that he claimed to know where the alleged 'crack' video was and that the person who had it may have been murdered for what he knew. A still image obtained by Gawker and The Toronto Star - allegedly taken from the video -  purportedly shows Ford with two men. One of them is believed to be Smith, who was gunned down outside at Toronto nightclub last month. The report comes as Ford's press secretary George Christopoulos and deputy press secretary Isaac Ransom have stepped down amid the uproar. Additionally, chief of staff Mark Towhey was fired late last week, according to reports. Pout: Vacated by his communications staffers and facing drug allegations, Ford has clearly seen better days . Rumors: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (right) said on a talk show hosted by his brother City Councillor Doug Ford that a video of him allegedly smoking crack cocaine does not exist . Furthermore, the Globe and Mail has conducted an in-investigation into Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's background and family and alleges that they were 'once deeply immersed in the illegal drug scene.' Doug Ford, the mayor's brother who is also a Toronto City Councillor Doug is alleged to have sold hashish in the 1980s, another brother Randy is reported to have been involved in a drug-related kidnapping and Ford's sister Kathy has been alleged to have ties with the KKK. In the article, it alleges the mayor's brother, Toronto City Councillor Doug, sold large quantities of hashish in the 1980s. There are no records of him ever having been charged in relation to the alleged drug sale. The article, that cited 10 anonymous sources, also claimed his brother Randy had been charged in a drug-related kidnapping. Scandal: Rob Ford, far right with his wife, has been the object of scrutiny after reports of a video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine . Strain: Rob Ford, with his mother, said at a press conference on Friday that the scandal has taken a toll on his family . Additionally Ford's sister was named as having connections to the KKK and having been involved in drug related violence. Ford's brother Doug called the newspaper 'little sleaze bags' and 'a bunch of scums' for going after the family. 'I think it's pretty low, and a bunch of sleazy, sleazy journalism. It has gone to the bottom of the barrel … it makes me sick,' he told a Global News reporter. Globe's editor-in-chief John Stackhouse defended the piece, telling CBC News that it was 'important to get this on the public record.' The Globe said that it has been working on the story for several months and decided to go public after Ford's public denial on Friday that he had ever used drugs. 'I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine,' Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said in a press conference Friday afternoon, after a week of silence since reports of the video emerged. 'As for a video, I cannot comment on a video that I have not seen, or does not exist.'","Toronto Mayor Rob Ford arrived at City Hall today on his 44th birthday as crack cocaine scandal continues to grow .

Luke Walker is alleged by Greek . prosecutors to have beaten 20-year-old Chelsea Hyndman, leaving her with . injuries which are said to have led to her death three years ago. Miss Hyndman was admitted to hospital . in Heraklion, Crete, with abdominal pains on May 16, 2010, and died the . following day. Heraklion Mixed Criminal Court heard she died as a result . of acute peritonitis. Walker - an electrician who was living . in the resort town of Malia where he and Chelsea worked in bars - . claims she fell during a night out. He denies one count of murder, and had . wiped tears from his eyes as a close friend told his trial today of the . plans the couple had for their future together before Miss Hyndman's . death. But separate evidence in the form of . written statements read to the court purportedly from one woman who . signed her name only as 'Jessie' and another from a man named as 'Peter . Rogers' alleged there had previously been violence in their . relationship. The typed letter from Jessie, dated . June 14 2010, said she knew the couple and that when Walker was sober he . was okay, but when they went out drinking he was jealous of other men . talking to Miss Hyndman. It claimed to know of two other times when Walker beat Miss Hyndman and kicked her in the stomach. The letter added: 'All do not know what goes on behind closed doors and they are too scared to come out to tell you.' Walker's friends and family shouted out in court as it was read and asked: 'Jessie? Who's Jessie?' Another document submitted to the . court that was sent to Greek Police from Peter Rogers said he had . overheard a conversation between Walker's father Patrick and a friend at . an event in the West Midlands in which he is claimed to have said that . Walker admitted to him he had hit Miss Hyndman when he was drunk. George Pyromallis, Walker's defence . barrister, submitted to the court that the documents could easily be . false and he was uneasy about them being allowed in evidence.

Carefree: Ms Hyndman and Walker were both living on the Greek island and working in bars before she died . The court was also read a statement . from Eda Quirici, a neighbour of Walker and Miss Hyndman, who said she . often heard 'intense arguments' between the pair. She lived in the apartment below . them, and said: 'These arguments were so intense, so fierce, that I . could not sleep for the noise.' In her statement she said that though . she was not absolutely certain of the date, she remembers hearing an . argument in the apartment at around 4am on May 12 when she returned home . from her bar job. 'I heard the girl screaming like someone does like when someone is being chased or being beaten. 'I heard furniture being dragged about like when someone is trying to chase a person.'

Miss Hyndman, pictured left in Crete, died after suffering severe injuries to her abdomen. Walker, pictured right, is accused of causing her death by actual bodily harm . Earlier Walker had broken down in . tears as he listened to a friend of Miss Hyndman tell the court how the . suspect had wanted to marry and have children with the girlfriend he is . accused of murdering. Lyndsay Williamson, who had been . friends with Miss Hyndman since 2007, said the couple had fallen in love . quickly and their two-year relationship was strong. Fighting back tears she told the court: 'He loved her 100 per cent. 'My impression of Luke was the same as . Chelsea's impression of Luke - they wanted to be together, they wanted a . future together, they wanted to get married, they wanted to have . children.' Walker, 25, of Brierley Hill near . Dudley, West Midlands, who sat behind Miss Williamson in court, put his . hands to his eyes and quietly cried as he listened to her evidence. The court heard that he and Miss . Hyndman, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, were 'very much in love' and . 'felt invincible'. Walker maintains his innocence - . claiming Miss Hyndman sustained her injuries after falling over on a . night out . Miss Williamson said that in 2009 the . couple left Malia and returned to England to find work and also to work . on their relationship because they had been having some difficulties. She said they decided to go home for some space and because they wanted to make things work. She added: 'They were a little bit jealous of each other's past relationships with other people but not with any malice. 'I can't explain it any more than that they were a very young couple.' Walker and Miss Hyndman returned to . Malia together in 2010 because they felt they had worked through their . issues, they missed their friends, and were happier abroad. Miss Williamson said Miss Hyndman had . been like her 'little sister' and she would have known if anything bad . had happened to her or if anyone had hurt her. The court heard evidence yesterday from Louise Purdy, who had been on a night out with Miss Hyndman on May 6. During the night Miss Hyndman had . fallen over on a cobbled street, landing with her left hand under her . body near her stomach area, Miss Purdy told the court. The court heard that as the night wore on she told friends she was okay but had hurt her stomach a little. Delayed: Walker's trial started Crete yesterday - three years after his girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman died . Miss Williamson said that by May 11 she noticed a difference in Miss Hyndman. They had both spent time at the beach . and had got badly burned by the sun and later that day, when the pair . met up to go for a few drinks, Miss Hyndman 'seemed so out of it and . disorientated'. Miss Williamson saw her again on May . 12 and said Miss Hyndman was being sick and had stomach cramps and . thought she had sunstroke. She briefly saw her again as she was . going into hospital and asked if she wanted her to go too. Miss Hyndman . replied: 'I just want to be with Luke', the court heard. James Sharp, Miss Williamson's partner, said Walker and Miss Hyndman's relationship was strong. 'It was a good relationship,' he told the court. 'We did a lot of things together as partners, me and my partner and Luke and Chelsea together. 'Going round for barbecues...it was a good relationship.' Party town: Walker lived in Crete for two-and-a-half years, working in a bar in Malia, pictured . Case: Prosecutors claim Walker punched or kicked Miss Hyndman in her stomach causing her fatal injuries . Mr Sharp and Miss Williamson lived in an apartment opposite the couple and he told the court he would have been in a position to hear if they had an argument at home. He said he was in bed at home on the night that it is alleged there was a row between the pair. He was asked if it was possible if there had been a 'huge argument or a tremendous noise' that he would have been woken up, and he answered 'possibly'. A letter was also read to the court that Miss Hyndman's mother Heather, who was in court, wrote to Walker when he was in prison. He has since been granted bail by the court. In it she wrote: 'Luke, I know you and Chelsea love each other dearly.'I can't believe it's ended like this. 'I'm sorry I haven't come to see you, I hope you can understand why. There's so many things going through my mind.' She said: 'Chelsea's coming home with me tomorrow' and said she would take care of her. She told Walker: 'I hope things work out for you' and added: 'I hope things will end soon so my baby can rest in peace.' The trial continues.

The relic dropped through farmer Keith Potter’s door this week - with a postmark of January 3, 1912.It was addressed to a Vida Doel who once lived at the same address, but whose family left 87 years ago. The card - in remarkably good condition - has a black and white photo of the fire brigade in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, with their horse-drawn carriages. A pencil message is written on the back from 12 year-old Vida’s mother, giving her instructions to take a pony and meet her in Chippenham. Farmer Potter has been left baffled by a postcard delivered to his home 100 years after it was originally sent . Farmer Keith, 65, of Christian Malford, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, said: 'I couldn’t believe it when I saw it. 'We checked with the postman who delivers here a few days after we received it that he had delivered it and he said he did. He said it was in his delivery bag. 'Where has it been all these years? It’s not damaged. Wherever it has been, it has been kept really well. It hasn’t been affected by damp or mice. 'Had it fallen down the back of a desk or machine all these years?' The postcard, with a half-penny stamp of King George V, was originally posted from Monkton Farleigh, near Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire. Paul Dauwalder, senior expert at stamp dealers Dauwalders of Salisbury, examined the postcard. The postcard features a black and white photo of the horse-drawn carriages of Trowbridge fire brigade . He said: 'It was postmarked by hand at a sub post office in Monkton Farleigh on January 3 1912. It would have been sent for distribution to Chippenham. The stamp on the postcard is of King George V and it was issued at the end of 1911. 'The postcard is in good condition. It has probably got lost somewhere in the back of a sorting office or base. Mail such as this is sometimes found when redundant machinery is being taken away. 'In 1912 sending messages by mail was in its heyday. People would use the postal service like telephones now. 'If this postcard was posted before 11am in that postal area then the addressee should expect to receive it by teatime the same day.' The postcard features a message to Vida Doel from her mother, asking her to take a pony into Chippenham . The postcard features a message written in pencil by 12 year-old Vida Doel’s mother instructing her daughter to take a pony . and meet her in Chippenham. It reads: 'Dear V. If you hear nothing else from us you can bring the pony into Chippenham . and wait for us by JW Daniels as we should come over the steps come in . steady; get there by 4 o’clock Thursday. Love to all from mother.' The card has a second, recent postmark which suggests it was rediscovered lately and put back into the postal system. A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'It is extremely unlikely that this item was in our system all this time. 'It is difficult to speculate what may have happened, but almost certainly it was put back in a post box very recently, as we regularly check all our sorting office and machines are cleared. 'There are also two postmarks - the original one and a very recent one. Everything points to this being put back in the Royal Mail system.' Mr Potter has researched the Doel family and found they lived at Paradise Farm from 1907.

A woman whose boyfriend died in police custody despite gasping for air and pleading for help is considering filing a lawsuit, her lawyer said Tuesday after the U.S. Justice Department said the three officers would not face federal charges. Robbery suspect Derek Williams died in July 2011 after fleeing about a block and a half from officers. The medical examiner's office initially classified the death as natural, saying he died of sickle cell crisis - he had the genetic marker for sickle cell but not the disease itself. It was reclassified as a homicide after an investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A video obtained by the newspaper showed the 22-year-old struggling to breathe and pleading for help from the backseat of a police car for nearly eight minutes, then growing progressively weaker and collapsing. Police eventually performed CPR and called paramedics. Williams was dead within an hour. Scroll down for video . Lost love: Sharday Rose, 24, poses in Milwaukee with a photo of her boyfriend, Derek Williams, who died in 2011 in police custody while gasping for breath . Family: Williams' mother, Sonya Moore, left, and her attorney, Robin Shellow, tell reporters they're considering a lawsuit against Milwaukee police . The U.S. Department of Justice and FBI investigated but could not find enough evidence to support charging the officers involved with depriving a person's rights under the color of law, U.S. Attorney James Santelle told reporters Tuesday. A special prosecutor previously declined to file state charges for similar reasons. In March, the inquest jury found probable cause to support charging the three officers in state court with failure to render aid. But special prosecutor John Franke said he wasn't confident he could meet the standard of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Victim: Williams (pictured) died in July 2011 after fleeing about a block and a half from officers. To bring federal charges, Santelle would have to prove the officers had specific intent to deprive Williams of his rights. 'Mistake, misperception, negligence or poor judgment are not sufficient' to bring federal charges, Santelle said. However, he declined to say whether there was evidence of mistake, misperception or poor judgment. Derek Williams's mother wept silently throughout the news conference, wiping her reddened eyes with the back of her hand. Afterward she told reporters she hasn't been able to sleep since her son died. 'Everyone that's seen that tape knows that was some wrongdoing,' Sonya Moore said, fighting back tears. 'This is not justice. This is not justice. ... I'm so hurt right now.' Her attorney, Robin Shellow, said she was angry when Santelle declined to offer an opinion on whether the police officers did anything wrong. She also said the reason none of the white police officers was being held accountable is because Williams is black and that the justice system in Milwaukee doesn't care about black people. 'They have no opinion because the lives of young black men don't merit an opinion. That's what I heard,' Shellow said. Shellow said it was too early to discuss a lawsuit. But Jonathan Safran, who represents Williams' girlfriend, Sharday Rose, said his client is seriously considering legal action. 'We certainly think that someone needs to be held accountable,' Safran said, 'and to this date no one has been held accountable.' FBI agents who looked into the case . found no medical evidence to back reports that police used excessive . force on Williams or knowingly ignored his apparent medical distress, . the Justice Department said. It also said the squad-car video does not . show the scene from the officers' vantage point and there's no evidence . that officers were watching Williams on the video monitor or for the . entire time. In video from the night he died, Williams repeatedly tells police officers he cannot breathe but he is ignored . Arrested: Williams was cuffed and thrown in the back of a police car . Franke, the special prosecutor, had noted in his report that the squad-car video was filmed with an infrared camera that produces a clearer image than what police would have seen on that dark night. He also wrote that officers' views might have been compromised by glare from their laptops reflecting on the plastic window between the front and back seats. The officers - Jason Bleichwehl, Jeffrey Cline and Richard Ticcioni - declined to testify during the inquest, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Other officers testified that they thought Williams was faking. The Justice Department is still reviewing whether it should sue the Milwaukee Police Department for a pattern of civil-rights violations. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said in a statement that the department has taken significant steps to prevent similar tragedies and is committed to regaining the community's trust wherever it is weakened.","Robbery suspect Derek Williams of Wisconsin died in police custody in July 2011 .

Protest: Maria Alyokhina, pictured last year, has gone on a hunger strike after a court blocked her from attending her parole hearing . One of the two jailed members of Pussy Riot has gone on a hunger strike after being barred from her own parole hearing. Maria Alyokhina, 24, says the court is violating her rights by not allowing her to take part in the hearing and told her lawyers to quit proceedings in Berezniki, in Perm Krai, central Russia. Ms Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, are serving . two-years terms for their 'punk prayer' protest in a Moscow cathedral in February last year. Pussy Riot, a feminist 'punk-rock collective', entered Cathedral of Christ the Savior clad in colourful balaclavas and staged a performance singing a song urging the Virgin Mary to 'throw Putin out'. Ms Alyokhina and Ms Tolokonnikova were arrested with a third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, and held without bail for five months before their August trial. All three were convicted, with Ms Samutsevich later released on probation. Speaking by a video link from prison during proceedings on Wednesday, Ms Alyokhina told the court considering her request for release on parole that she is going on a hunger strike. 'In protest against the court's refusal to allow me to appear in person to take part in the hearing, I'm going on a hunger strike. 'In the current circumstances I forbid all my lawyers and representatives to take part in this court hearing.' Following her statement, Alyokhina's lawyer  Irina Khrunova left the court, acting on her client's wishes. She said Alyokhina's decision was a method of last resort. 'She decided that only in this way, with the attention (brought by) a hunger strike, could she show how the rights of defendants are violated,' Ms Khrunova said. 'She made this decision soundly, independently, and after deliberation.' Pussy Riot: Yekaterina Samutsevich, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' in August last year . Anti Putin: Members of Pussy Riot, pictured before the 'punk prayer', performed a protest song in a protest song criticising Vladimir Putin in a central Moscow cathedral in February last year . Following Ms Alyokhina’s announcement yesterday, Sir Paul McCartney has written to Russian authorities asking them to consider her parole. The former Beatle, who has previously expressed his support for the group, has asked officials to grant Ms Alyokhina the right to be present at a future hearing in several handwritten letters. He said: ‘My personal belief is that further incarceration for Maria will be harmful for her and the situation as a whole, which, of course, is being watched by people all over the world. Helping hand: Sir Paul McCartney has written to the court asking them to allow Ms Alyokhina to attend her hearing . ‘In the great tradition of fair-mindedness which the Russian people (many of whom are my friends) are famous for, I believe that you granting this request would send a very positive message to all the people who have followed this case.’ In a further letter, regarding Ms Tolokonnikova, Sir Paul said: ‘I have had a long relationship with the Russian people, and, with this in mind, I am making the following request in a spirit of friendship for my many Russian acquaintances who, like me, believe in treating people - all people - with compassion and kindness.’ Ms Alyokhina's mother, Natalia, said . she had little faith in Russian justice and would not raise her hopes of . her daughter's parole. 'I don't expect anything good from the judge. It will be hard,' she said. According to documents read in court . Ms Alyokhina's behaviour in prison may risk her parole. She is said to . be rude to prison staff and to not respect sleeping hours. The three Pussy Riot members were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' last August, following a trial seen by their supporters as part of a clampdown on dissent by Putin during his third term in power. Ms Samutsevich was released on parole in October 2012, while Ms Tolokonnikova, 23, was denied parole last month. Both Ms Tolokonnikova and Ms Alyokhina both have young children, and have requested to have their sentences deferred until they are older. Both requests have been rejected by courts and the pair are due for release next March. In Ms Alyokhina's case, the judge at the court in Berezniki, located 620 miles northeast of Moscow, adjourned the parole hearing until Thursday afternoon.","Jailed Pussy Riot member hunger strikes after court refuses her attendance .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:37 EST, 19 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 29 May 2013 . Deal: Sgt. Robert Bales' lawyer said that he will be pleading guilty in an effort to avoid the death penalty, which the U.S. Army was seeking in his case after he reportedly killed 16 Afghan villagers in a predawn rampage in March . The U.S. Army said Wednesday it will seek the death penalty against the soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a predawn rampage in March, a decision his lawyer called 'totally irresponsible.' The announcement followed a pretrial hearing last month for Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 39, who faces premeditated murder and other charges in the attack on two villages in southern Afghanistan. The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan, and it was three weeks before American investigators could reach the crime scenes. Prosecutors said Bales left his remote southern Afghanistan base early on March 11, attacked one village and returned to the base, then slipped away again to attack another nearby compound. Of the 16 people killed, nine were children. No date has been set for Bales' court martial, which will be held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Seattle. His civilian lawyer, John Henry Browne, said he met with Army officials last week to argue his client shouldn't face the possibility of the death penalty, given that Bales was serving his fourth deployment in a war zone when the killings occurred. 'The Army is not taking responsibility for Sgt. Bales and other soldiers that the Army knowingly sends into combat situations with diagnosed PTSD, concussive head injuries and other injuries,' Browne said. 'The Army is trying to take the focus off the failure of its decisions, and the failure of the war itself, and making Sgt. Bales out to be a rogue soldier.' Bales' wife, Kari Bales, said in a statement Wednesday that she and their children have been enjoying their weekend visits with Bales at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, and she hopes he receives an impartial trial. Changing tales: Bales' lawyer says the army should take greater responsibility for sending soldiers into combat who are suffering from PTSD and head injuries, but now he seems grateful for the plea deal . 'I no longer know if a fair trial for Bob is possible, but it very much is my hope, and I will have faith,' she said. Bales' defense team has said the government's case is incomplete, and outside experts have said a key issue going forward will be to determine if Bales suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Bales grew up in the Cincinnati suburb of Norwood, Ohio, and served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. During last month's preliminary hearing, prosecutors built a strong eyewitness case against the veteran soldier, with troops recounting how they saw Bales return to the base alone, covered in blood. Afghan witnesses questioned via a video link from a forward operating base near Kandahar City described the horror of that night. A teenage boy recalled how the gunman kept firing as children scrambled, yelling: 'We are children! We are children!' A young girl in a bright headscarf recalled hiding behind her father as he was shot to death. Bodies of Afghan civilians, allegedly shot by US soldier Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, loaded into the back of a van in Alkozai village of Panjwayi district, Kandahar province . An Army criminal investigations command special agent testified earlier that Bales tested positive for steroids three days after the killings, and other soldiers testified that Bales had been drinking the evening of the massacre. Prosecutors, in asking for a court-martial trial, have pointed to statements Bales made after he was apprehended, saying his comments demonstrated a 'clear memory of what he had done, and consciousness of wrongdoing.' Several soldiers testified at a hearing that Bales returned to the base alone just before dawn, covered in blood, and that he made incriminating statements such as, 'I thought I was doing the right thing.' The U.S. military has not executed anyone since 1961. There are five men currently facing military death sentences, all for murders committed stateside, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Nidal Hasan, charged in the 2009 rampage that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen others at Fort Hood in Texas, also could face the death penalty if convicted; no date has been set for his court martial. For Bales to face execution, the court martial jury must unanimously find him guilty of premeditated murder. They also must determine that at least one aggravating factor applies, such as multiple or child victims, and that the aggravating factor substantially outweighs any extenuating or mitigating circumstances. Innocent: Kari Bales told ABC News last month: 'My husband did not do this. I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that my husband is not involved' Bales, a father . of two . from Lake Tapps, Wash., joined the Army in late 2001 - after the 9/11 . attacks - as his career as a stockbroker imploded. An arbitrator entered . a $1.5 million fraud judgment against him and his former company that . went unpaid, and his attempt to start an investment firm in Florida also . failed. He was serving his fourth combat tour . after three stints in Iraq, and his arrest prompted a national . discussion about the stresses posed by multiple deployments. Kari Bales maintains . that her husband is innocent and was not responsible for the senseless . slayings. Speaking to ABC News last month, she said she finds it . 'incomprehensible' that her husband and best friend, 'Bob,' faces 16 . charges of premeditated murder. 'It doesn't seem possible. Especially . that there were women and children,' she said. 'My heart goes out to . those families that lost loved ones, parents and grandparents. I am a . mom; I can't imagine losing my child, especially to something like . that.' Ms Bales said she learned of the . attack within hours from military officials and her initial reaction was . that 'it must have been a mistake.' 'It . certainly wasn't, it wasn't my husband,' she said. 'I know my husband. I know . him very well, and especially the talk about the women and the children. I knew that it wasn't my husband. So it was just incomprehensible to . me.' Speaking to her husband in the middle of that March night confirmed to her that even he didn't know what really happened. 'He was like, 'What? What you talking . about?' He had, he knew that something was going on, but did not know . the extent of what was going on, and I was actually the one that had . told him how many people had died, and that included women and children, . and he was blown away. He did not know the details as they had been . portrayed in the press.' A courtroom sketch of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, third from left, during his hearing last month . But Kari told ABC News she believes the . truth has yet to come out. 'I don't think we have even begun to have the truth.' In the meantime, Ms Bales said she . finds it hard explaining to the couples' two-year-old son and . five-year-old daughter why their father is sitting in a jail cell. 'It's . been difficult,' she said. 'I question myself, what is the right thing . to say, what is the right thing to explain to them, what can they . understand? And for me, I don't even really understand what is . happening, so how can I possibly expect my kids to understand, right?' But . the family regularly travels the to where Bales' has been calling home. Their conversations are monitored but at least, she says, they can be a . family. 'We . are together, we're as a family. We're regular; we can look forward to . it. We know when we are going to see him again. It's somewhat normal,' she said. To . help pay what could end up being millions of dollars in legal fees, Ms . Bales has set up a website, www.helpsgtbales.com, where people can . donate to the SSG Bales Legal Defense Fund. 'Really . the reason we need a defense fund is to get a fair trial out of this. I . really feel Bob gave his best for his country. Now it is time for . America to give their best to him.' She . told the TV station that she tries not to dwell on the possibility that . her husband may spend his life behind bars or worse, face the death . penalty. 'I . have come to terms with that, and that I have put away. You know, I . thought about it and I put it away until I actually have to deal with . it. So you, I have learned to compartmentalize a lot of these issues, . too.

But luckily their daughter, a 20-year-old nursery worker, knew exactly what to do. Emma Harris realised that seven-month-old boxer Lola had suffered an allergic reaction and swung into action. Determined to bring the family pet back from the dead, she started performing CPR. Angel of mercy: Emma Harris with her dog Lola, who she saved with CPR after the seven month old boxer suffered an extreme allergic reaction when she was stung by a bee . Recalling the moments after Lola . swallowed the bee and was stung,  Miss Harris said: ‘She seemed fine at . first and then five minutes later she was sick. ‘After she collapsed we couldn’t feel a . pulse. My dad was shouting, “She’s gone, she’s gone”. My mum was a mess . and my dad didn’t know what to do.

After a few minutes the dog was revived, choking for breath, and was taken to be examined by a vet. ‘I needed to keep pumping her chest for a good couple of minutes,’ Miss Harris said at the family home in Plymouth. ‘Jim helped me to keep calm and held Lola’s head for me while I pressed on her chest. ‘When she started to breathe again he told me to take a rest. I had just . given 60 compressions in a row and he said that I might have to give . her more.’ Relief: Emma Harris with her Lola and her parents Ian and Tammy. The family lost a pet dog last year and were overjoyed when Emma revived Lola . The vet gave Lola steroids to help counteract the bee sting, and she was soon back to her usual adventurous self. Her relieved owner said: ‘If I hadn’t taken part in a first aid course at work then I wouldn’t have known what to do. ‘I am quite proud of myself for doing it. She’s my pet and she’s only . young. We lost a dog last June, another boxer called Stella, so it would . have been horrible to lose Lola so quickly.’ Emma’s grandmother Shirley Ball, 66, said: ‘Her mother told me that Emma just told them to go away and let her get on with it. ‘The circumstances could have been very different if she hadn’t decided to act.

Released: Rachel Dougall, 38, is to return to the UK after serving a 12-month sentence in Bali for failing to report a drugs crime . A British mother is expected to arrive back home tomorrow after spending 12 months behind bars in Bali for failing to report a drug-connected crime. At one stage Rachel Dougall feared she would face the firing squad after British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford - who is herself on death row - accused her of being part of a British ‘gang of four’ involved in a major drug smuggling racket. Miss Dougall, 38, was released from the notorious Kerobokan prison today and, local officials said, was immediately deported. She is expected to join her parents at their home in Brighton, where she will be re-united with her seven-year-old daughter, Kitty. Miss Dougall was arrested, along with her partner Julian Ponder, at their luxury Bali villa in May last year after Mrs Sandiford had accused them of being part of a syndicate behind the attempted importation of £1.6million of cocaine onto the island. Local people on the holiday island referred to Miss Dougall and Ponder as the ‘King and Queen of Bali.’ That was the impression the pair gave to the farming community who toiled for £1 a day in the fields surrounding their luxury three-bedroom villa with its large swimming pool and marble floors. But the couple, who locals said were too ‘high and mighty’ to talk to them, were shocked when drug squad officers raided their home and allegedly found two small packets of cocaine. The police had gone there on information passed to them by Mrs Sandiford, now 56, who was caught with a suitcase full of cocaine as she passed through Bali airport and who is now appealing against the death sentence. Miss Dougall, 38, escaped with a relatively light punishment, being given 12 months for failing to report a crime while Ponder, the father of their young daughter Kitty, has received six years. Miss Dougall’s time has now been served and today she was released from Kerobokan Prison. She was expected to return to arrive back in Britain tomorrow or soon after. She admitted in a number of interviews that the first weeks following her arrest were a ‘living hell’. She was terrified that she would be given the death penalty and, in time, be led into an orchard in the dead of night, tied blindfolded to a stake and gunned down by a firing squad. Accusation: Lindsay Sandiford, 56, who accused Ms Dougall of being part of a British 'gang of four' cocaine smuggling syndicate, sits in her cell knitting while on death row in Kerobokan prison . As she was dragged through the Indonesian court processes, uncertain of what her future would be, she lost weight, screamed that she was losing her mind and had to receive hospital treatment. When she eventually learned that she would receive just one year, she said she just ‘settled down’ to wait out the time for her release. Even so, tensions between her and Ponder, now 44, - who was sentenced to six years for drug possession - intensified in the prison. Although separated in men’s and women’s quarters the pair were said to have been caught fighting through a fence.

He remains in jail serving a six-year sentence after the property was raided by police who found cocaine . Recently Miss Dougall admitted that it was ‘all over’ between them and she just wanted to get on with her life. Ironically while she said she was looking forward to arriving home to be with her daughter and staying with her parents Stella and Paul in Brighton, she still intended to return to Bali before the end of the year. She said she wanted to do that so that her daughter could be near her father and in any case she wanted to continue working at setting up the shoe business she was working on when she was arrested.","Rachel Dougall was accused by death row grandmother Lindsay Sandiford of being part of a drug smuggling syndicate .

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has warned that failure to win the battle against youth unemployment could tear Europe apart . German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has warned that failure to win the battle against youth unemployment could tear Europe apart. Germany, along with France and Italy, backed urgent action to rescue a generation of young Europeans who fear they will not find jobs. Youth unemployment in the EU stands at nearly one in four, more than twice the adult rate. He also said that abandoning the continent's welfare model in favour of tougher U.S. standards would cause 'revolution'. 'We need to be more successful in our fight against youth unemployment, otherwise we will lose the battle for Europe's unity,' Schaeuble said. While Germany insists on the importance of budget consolidation, Schaeuble spoke of the need to preserve Europe's welfare model. If U.S. welfare standards were introduced in Europe, 'we would have revolution, not tomorrow, but on the very same day,' Schaeuble told a conference in Paris. 'We have to rescue an entire generation of young people who are scared. 'We have the best-educated generation and we are putting them on hold. This is not acceptable,' Italian Labour minister Enrico Giovannini said. Germany in particular, weary of a backlash as many in crisis-hit European countries blame it for austerity, has over the past weeks taken steps to tackle unemployment, striking bilateral deals with Spain and Portugal. German ministers told the conference that to help young people find jobs, Europe must continue on the path of structural reforms to boost its competitiveness as well as make good use of available EU funds, including six billion euros that leaders have set aside for youth employment for 2014-20. While all agreed on the urgency needed to tackle youth unemployment, ministers offered no concrete plans, insisting Europe must be pragmatic and work on various strands. Schaeuble said this was why Germany had also decided to strike deals with countries such as Spain and Greece. 'Let's be honest, there is no quick fix, there is no grand plan,' said Werner Hoyer, head the European Investment Bank. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has invited EU labour ministers to a youth unemployment conference while French President Francois Hollande urged he euro zone to work towards a joint economic government . Together with ministers, he said policies aimed at boosting youth employment must focus on small and medium-sized enterprises as they are the main entry point to the labour market for most. More than half of Spain's under 25-year-olds are jobless, as are nearly 40 percent in Portugal. In Greece, youth unemployment shot to a record 64 percent in February. In March 2013, the lowest youth unemployment rates were in Germany and Austria, both below eight per cent, highlighting the wide disparities within the EU. The youth employment crisis will be a central theme of a June EU leaders' summit, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has invited EU labour ministers to a youth unemployment conference in Berlin on July 3. Following up on an idea aired earlier this month, French President Francois Hollande urged the euro zone to work towards a joint economic government with its own budget which could take on specific projects including tackling youth unemployment.","Germany, France and Italy backed urgent action to rescue a generation of young Europeans .

Tensions: Downing Street insiders have expressed alarm at Defence Secretary Philip Hammond's recent outbursts . Philip Hammond could quit the Cabinet over fresh spending cuts to the armed forces, it was claimed today. The Defence Secretary’s future is the subject of increased government speculation after speaking out on Europe, gay marriage and cutting welfare. Aides sought to scotch the rumours, insisting he remains one of David Cameron’s most loyal ministers. But some in the Tory party believe he is 'on manoeuvres'. Government departments are locked in a battle with the Treasury over their budgets for 2015-16. Chancellor George Osborne will set out details of an extra £11.5billion next month, but Treasury sources say ‘some ministers have been more helpful than others’ in finding ways to cut spending by up to 10 per cent. Mr Hammond is among ministers demanding a fresh squeeze on welfare to avoid deep cuts in vital services, such as the Army and flood defences. Senior Downing Street insiders have expressed dismay at a ‘pattern of behaviour’ from the 57-year-old who has repeatedly spoken out on issues designed to appeal to Tory traditionalists. And the Finanical Times reported: 'Some Tories speculate that the 57-year-old Mr Hammond, who was previously considered somewhat grey and ultraloyal, might even quit rather than implement further cuts to the armed forces, setting himself up as a leader of the Tory right.' But a source close to Mr Hammond dismissed the idea he was ready to walk out of the government. ‘He is one of the most loyal members of the government. He has no truck with any suggestion that he is trying to be difficult.’ Mr Hammond believes the spending review has been a ‘grown-up exercise’ and has ‘found some efficiency savings’. Source close to Philip Hammond . However, . others in government believe co-operation behind the scenes is in . contrast with public utterances apparently at odds with the Prime . Minister. A week ago he claimed plans to legalise gay marriage are fuelling ‘a realm sense of anger’ among voters. Mr  Cameron’s flagship policy had unnecessarily upset ‘vast numbers of people’, he added. That outburst came just days after Mr . Hammond said he would vote for Britain to leave the European Union if a . referendum was held now. Prime Minister David Cameron made clear he disagreed with an MoD ban on soldiers wearing uniforms in public . Defiant: Soldiers walk outside Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich Headquarters, close to the scene where a soldier was murdered in John Wilson Street . In a sign of the irritation in Number 10, insiders made clear Mr Cameron’s unhappiness with Ministry of Defence guidance that soldiers should not wear uniforms in public after the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby. The ban was put into place immediately after Wednesday’s brutal attack in Woolwich, but was scaled back after a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra meeting yesterday morning. Mr Cameron is understood to have told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond he was ‘seriously dismayed’ at official guidance given to personnel in London following the murder. Insisting that the ban be rescinded, Mr Cameron told a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall: ‘The best way to defeat terrorism is for everyone – including our brave service personnel – to go about their lives as normal.’ The dressing down was a blow for Mr Hammond, who is understood to have agreed that the uniform ban should be implemented.","Defence Secretary called for more welfare cuts to protect armed forces .

'They are always a balance between a nice quick car and a good handling car, with quality and traditional interior. 'I've spent £509,000 on them in total - but you only live once and I've had a lot of fun in them. 'It's hard to choose my favourite over the years. 'The latest one I've got is one of the best I think - they seem to get better and better.' Shared passion: His wife Grace, who died in 2010, also had his love of travel and Jaguars . Glittering: In one year he bought five different cars - all Jaguar . The one model that he is not so keen on is the XJ Saloon (not pictured) Mark-up: The turquoise E-Type he sold for a £7,000 profit in 1982 . He added: 'The XF Saloon was great, and the E Type was brilliant - but I like them all for different reasons. 'The only one I'm not so keen on is the XJ Saloon, which is driven by the Prime Minister. 'I always try to buy British, we all know Jaguar have been bought out by an Indian company, but factories still provide plenty of work for British people. 'It is an iconic British institution.' Mr Moore has only ever made a profit on one of his cars, a turquoise E Type, which he bought for £3,000 and sold on for £10,000 in 1982. His love for Jaguar was also shared with his wife Grace, who died in 2010. Scarlet: Mr Moore and his wife enjoyed the 'freedom' of motoring holidays on the Continent . Metal symphony: Jaguars are 'a balance between a nice quick car and a good handling car, with quality and traditional interior,' according to Mr Moore . Mr Moore has tried other luxury car manufacturers, but always finds himself coming back to Jaguar . They had a car each and would enjoy travelling around Europe, as far as Germany, France, Spain and the former Yugoslavia. He added: 'When you go away in a car, you see such a lot and you can stay in a place as long as you like. 'In a car you have more freedom. We never had any children so we could go wherever we wanted really. 'Grace would go for the more sporty versions, while I would have the more powerful cars. 'I think I pushed her into it a little bit though. But she definitely did like Jaguars. I made sure of that.' Tim Bull, sales manager at HA Fox Nottingham, said: 'I think I've sold him 21 cars personally - he is definitely our most loyal customer. 'Some years he buys two of three - there's very few people like him out there. Most people would think 'I bet that's easy' - but he drives a hard deal. 'He certainly knows how to negotiate a price, that's for sure.' However, it is not known whether Jaguar offers him a further discount after his decades of staggering loyalty. The F Type sells for between £58,000 to £80,000.","Barry Moore has spent half a million on the luxury cars .

But Manchester City fans Greg Collier and Rachel Nugent decided to go that little bit further than most. The dedicated Blues supporters turned their bathroom wall into a shrine to their heroes by building this amazing 2,000 tile mosaic of the club’s crest. Fans: Greg Collier and Rachel Nugent created this 5ft mosaic of the Manchester City Football Club in their bathroom - with the project even leading to the couple's engagement . Dedicated: The City supporters built the amazing 2,000 tile mosaic of the club's crest over six months . And after spending six months working together on the mosaic - Mr Collier decided it would be the perfect backdrop for him to ask his girlfriend for her hand in marriage. To complete the 5ft dazzling design, Mr Collier, 37, and Miss Nugent, 30, patiently stuck each individual tile chip to the wall. Miss Nugent, who works as a legal secretary, said: 'We moved into the house a couple of years ago and were doing it up. 'Some tiling was done in the bathroom but there was one wall remaining which looked a bit bare, so I suggested making a colourful mosaic City crest out of the remaining tiles. 'I was a bit of a whacky idea, but everyone understands our love for the team. We’re season ticket holders and never miss a game, so I don’t think anyone would expect anything less.' Lifelong supporter Mr Collier, who previously installed three stars on his garden footpath in celebration of last year’s Premier League title win, thought it was a cracking idea and sketched out a design. Project: To complete the 5ft dazzling design, Mr Collier, 37, and Miss Nugent, 30, patiently stuck each individual tile chip to the wall. These pictures show the mural's progress . Mr Collier, who lives in Newall Green, Manchester, with Miss Nugent and her four-year-old son Lewis, said: 'I have always loved drawing and loved the idea of completing a project together. 'We spent about six months in there, determined to get a little bit more done when we could. We used hammers to smash the tiles into minute pieces and even had to round some of them off with a file, to create curved edges. He said: 'We then had to paint each piece separately and it was very tough at times, making sure everything was symmetrical. 'We spent about 30 minutes on it each night and we encouraged each other to keep going.' And Mr Collier, who was hoping to pop the question at the Ethihad ground in front of thousands of fans, decided to propose to his girlfriend in the bathroom. Colourful: The couple are both season ticket holders and never miss a game of their beloved team. These images show the mural's progression late into the project . He said: 'I was going to as Rachel to marry me by putting it up on the big advertising screens at the football, but a guy who sits behind us at every game bet me to it. 'I figured, since we were spending so much time in the bathroom working on the mosaic, I thought it would be quite special and memorable.' And the proposal was totally unexpected for Miss Collier, who had just finished working on the piece that night. She said: 'It was like we were living in the bathroom and after spending a bit of time on the mosaic, I decided to run myself a lovely bath. I was lying back, relaxing. I closed my eyes for a second and when I opened them, Greg was kneeling next to the bath. 'It was amazing and such a surprise. The mosaic will always remind me of us getting engagement. She said: 'I’ve been there with him on so many nights chipping away at mosaic tiles. 'We’re both so passionate about the club and I think the mosaic is beautiful - it really has the wow factor. Thrilled: Although the happy couple are yet to set a date for their wedding, they hope to marry at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium . 'When our friends visit, they think we’re pretty mad, but we’re really mad about Man City. Everyone has been impressed with it, especially when you see the full size of it,' she laughed. And the couple are planning to also have their favourite club featuring at their wedding and although they are yet to set a date for the big day, they hope to bag the Etihad Football Stadium as the venue. Miss Collier said: 'Most brides would cringe at the thought of inviting their guests to a wedding on a football ground - not me. 'It would be a dream come true and we’ve already checked the venue out - we’d have the function in one of the suites. 'We’ll also have the team’s colours, I can just imagine everybody in light blue and white, it would just look stunning.'","Greg Collier and Rachel Nugent built amazing tile mosaic of club crest .

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is known in Westminster for being a hard-nosed Tory, with a keen eye for cutting costs. But his strait-laced, right-wing reputation suffered a blow today after he was revealed to have been a goth who read left-wing newspapers during his schooldays. The claim was all the more bizarre coming from former classmate, TV and radio host Richard Madeley. Makeover: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) was a 'goth' - like rock singer Marylin Manson - when at school, TV presenter Richard Madely has claimed . Mr Hammond is making headlines after defying David Cameron to say he would vote to leave Europe if there was a referendum now. The former businessman is now known for being a hardline Conservative, particularly on spending taxpayers money having served as George Osborne’s deputy in opposition. But it seems he was much less buttoned-up when a schoolboy growing up in Essex. In fact he was regularly reprimanded about not having his top button done up, slouching in official school photos. Mr Madeley revealed on Twitter that he was ‘at school with Phil Hammond - a Goth back then’. He is understood to have made a similar claim during a radio show in 2011, although sources close to Mr Hammond suggested it was a 'wind-up'. The pair were in the same class at Shenfield High School in Brentwood, Essex in the 1970s. Mr Madeley added that the future Tory Cabinet minister who appears at the Despatch Box in well-tailored suits ‘used to arrive in class in leather trench-coat with The Guardian under his arm’. Richard Madeley's tweet threatened to undermine Mr Hammond's reputation as a hard-nosed Conservative . Even in official school photographs, Mr Hammond took a laidback approach. In this picture from 1970 he is seen (circled) slouching with his top button undone, in contrast to his sharp apperance today . Mr Madeley made the revelation as Mr Hammond suggested he would vote to leave the EU if there was a referendum now. Mr Cameron today slapped him down, saying ministers should not answer ‘hypothetical questions’. Mr Madeley said the Prime Minister had . suffered a long weekend after Mr Hammond, and Education Secretary . Michael Gove had parked their ‘tanks on his lawn’. Mr . Hammond was born in Epping in Essex in December 1995. The son of a . civil engineer, he went to Shenfield school in Brentwood before studying . Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford. He . later worked in the private sector, for medical equipment and building . firms, before becoming Tory MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in 1997. He looks back fondly on his youth. ‘I had some very fond memories of school,’ Mr Hammond told the Brentwood Gazette last year. TV presenter Richard Madeley made the claim about Mr Hammond's secret past after he spoke out on the EU . He revealed how he made the decision to go to Oxford in 1970, which set him on course to one day join the Cabinet. He said: ‘Harold Wilson had been in office, but I didn't get anything he did. ‘I remember the day after the general election when Harold Wilson had lost, I remember quite clearly cycling from my house in Hutton along Long Ridings and feeling what a relief to live in a country with a Tory government again.’ He said he later bumbed into his headteacher. 'I hadn't really decided that until that moment. But I suppose everything else flowed from there. My life would have been totally different if it hadn't been for that. 'What I'm trying to say is that if you see an opportunity you have to grab it – it might not come round again.' Over the weekend Mr Hammond gave Mr Cameron a headache with his assertion that he would vote to leave the EU. Asked on the BBC’s Pienaar’s Politics radio programme whether he would vote to leave the EU as things stand, replied: ‘Yes, because I believe that we have to negotiate a better solution that works better for Britain if we are going to stay in and play a part in the European Union in the future. 'But let me be absolutely clear: I think it is defeatist to sort of say we want to leave the European Union. 'We’re going to try and change the rules and change the way it works and change the objectives that it has in order to make it something that works for Britain.' However, he added: 'If the choice is between an EU exactly as it is today and not being a part of that then I have to say that I’m on the side of the argument that Michael Gove has put forward.'","Defence Secretary's reputation as hard-nosed Conservative takes a knock .

The last of the American World War I veterans have described the perils of war, the emotional toll of fighting and the celebration of the armistice in a new book spotlighting their stories. Author Richard Rubin spent 10 years compiling information for his book, The Last of the Doughboys, tracking down numerous veterans, all in their 100s, and traveling across the country to meet them. Each of the subjects featured in Mr Rubin's book have since passed away. The last World War I veteran, Frank Buckles, died in 2011. Doughboys: The last of the American World War I veterans have described the perils of war, the emotional toll of fighting and the celebration of the armistice in a new book spotlighting their stories . As he tried to track down the former soldiers, he was often met with disappointment, finding out that the man or woman he was looking to speak with was no longer alive. Rubin told NPR that on one occasion, he discovered a 108-year-old vet who was alive and 'clear-minded,' but when Rubin showed up two weeks later, the man was unconscious in the hospital . He died the next day. But dozens more were alive, well and willing to share their stories. There was Arthur Fiala, who was 106 when he spoke to Mr Rubin. Mr Fiala spoke of his eagerness to pack his bags and join the Allies. Anticipation: Arthur Fiala, who was 106 when he spoke to Mr Rubin, spoke of his eagerness in his youth to pack his bags and join the Allies . Mr Fiala, who was from Wisconsin, said: 'I . went to Green Bay and enlisted in the army. And the big war was on then. I said I want to get over to France quick. 'You pick out the place where . you want me to go. The place where I can be. Wherever I can be used, . that's where I want to go.' Anthony Pierro, 107 at the time of his interview with Rubin, disagreed, saying that the Army is 'a miserable life.' He said: 'You can't do anything... on your own. They tell you what to do.' At one point, Mr Pierro said the best part of his time in World War I was being in the French city of Bordeaux. Trouble with war: Anthony Pierro, 107 at the time of his interview with Mr Rubin, disagreed, saying that the Army is 'a miserable life' 'The girls used to say, 'upstairs, two dollars.' But you didn't go upstairs, his nephew Rick interjected. 'I didn't have the two dollars.' Mr Pierro replied. Howard Ramsey, who was 105 when he spoke to Mr Rubin in 2003, said that he and his colleagues were at one time so ill-prepared for the cold that they resorted to sleeping in a cemetery. He said:  'So I remember one . night, it was cold, and we had no blankets, or nothing like that. We had . to sleep. 'We slept in the cemetery, because we could sleep between the . two graves, and keep the wind off of us.' Recollections: Howard Ramsey, who was 105 when he spoke to Mr Rubin in 2003, said that he and his colleagues were at one time so ill-prepared for the cold that they resorted to sleeping in a French cemetery . Courage under fire: J. Laurence Moffitt, 106 at the time of this interview said he and his colleagues 'lived' under enemy fire, and 'disregarded it' after a while . When asked whether he came under artillery fire often during WWI, J. Laurence Moffitt, 106 at the time, replied: 'All the time. We lived under it... After a while, you disregarded it.' Mr Moffitt added that he had been 'severely gassed several times - but I never went to medical for it.' William J. Lake, who was 107 when he sat down with Mr Rubin, perhaps came the closest to losing his life during the war in one of the most poignant stories told. Mr Lake also fought at the Meuse-Argonne offensive, the deadliest battle in American history. 'Well I'll tell ya, just bullets zipping around you all the time,' he said. 'You . just never knew when you was going to get hit. but I was lucky.' He told Mr Rubin: 'Another guy and I were sitting on a bank and a sniper shot him . instead of me... We was no more than two feet apart and he picked him . instead of me. He killed him of course.' Lucky one: William J. Lake, who was 107 when he sat down with Mr Rubin, talked about how he was sitting with a fellow soldier when he was suddenly shot by a sniper. He said that the shooter 'picked him instead of me' He said that the allied forces later found the shooter in a tree and [killed] him. 'Oh yeah. They didn't take [snipers] prisoner.' Hildegarde Schan, at 107, saw a different side of the war as a young woman. After working for the War Department in Washington, she was worked for the Veterans Bureau in New York after the armistice. It was the place where those who had served in the war went to collect their paychecks - and often received bad news. Empathy: Hildegarde Schan, at 107, saw a different side of the war as a young woman, dealing with returning soldiers - some without arms or legs - looking to get paid by the Veterans Bureau . Sickness: Reuben Law - 105 at the time of the interview -- said he was apart of a convoy en route to France in 1918 when a deadly flu epidemic struck . She told Rubin: 'It was very sad... You see them coming in with one leg or one arm... I couldn't take it anymore - to see them come in. She added: 'They'd borrow on their check and they'd have to pay it back next month and they didn't have any money then.' When the war ended with Armistice Day on November 11, 1918, George Briant wasn't celebrating. In fact, he was mourning. He said that he had seen a group of men . take shelter in a wooded area before it was shot up by enemy soldiers, . killing most of them. Survivor: Frank Buckles, the final World War I veteran, outlived 4.7million other U.S. servicemen before he died at age 110 in March 2011 . Mr Briant, 103 during his interview, said: 'Such fine, handsome, healthy young men, to be killed on the last night of the war. I cried for their parents.' Reuben Law - 105 at the time of the . interview -- said he was apart of a convoy en route to France in 1918 . when a deadly flu epidemic struck. He told Mr Rubin: 'I think we were in the . water for 21 days... The thing about the trip across was the flu, and there were 91 who died aboard ship. He said they converted the dining room of a ship to a hospital, where the sick soldiers had to sleep on tables. Mr Buckles, the final World War II veteran, outlived 4.7million other U.S. World War I servicemen before he died at age 110 in March 2011. But unlike the others, Buckles did not see World War I combat - at least not yet. In World War II, Buckles was captured by the Japanese in Manila and was held for three years as a prisoner of war. He told Mr Rubin about his dramatic escape when the camp was liberated by U.S. Army paratroopers. He said that he quickly grabbed his rucksack, got dressed and got out just before the burning roof collapsed.

Pope Francis has hit out at the Italian mafia for their role in human trafficking as he honoured a courageous priest murdered by the Cosa Nostra. Speaking in St Peter’s Square today, the Pope urged mobsters to abandon crime and ‘convert to God,’ addressing both male and female members of the mafia. Pope Francis’ words came the day after the beatification of the Rev. Giuseppe Puglisi, who was shot dead in 1993 for trying to keep young people from becoming mobsters. The Vatican honoured Puglisi as a martyr in the beatification ceremony in Palermo this weekend. Rev. Pugilisi was murdered in 20 years ago, for defiantly preaching against the Mafia in a neighbourhood of Palermo where Cosa Nostra held sway. Members of the notorious Sicilian mafia convicted of ordering the killing and are serving life sentences in prison. The pope did not attend the beatification ceremony, which saw over 50,000 people gather in Palermo to honour the priest. Instead, he used the traditional Sunday papal appearance in St. Peter's Square to hail Puglisi as a martyr and ‘an exemplary priest, especially dedicated’ to serving young people. ‘Educating young people according to the Gospel, he took them away from organized crime, and thus it (the Mafia) tried to defeat him by killing him,’ Francis said. ‘I think of the great pain suffered by men, women and even children, exploited by so many mafias.' Pope Francis denounced the crime syndicates for making the victims of human trafficking 'do work that makes them slaves, prostitution. ‘Behind this exploitation and slavery are the mafias.' Francis, two months into his papacy, has branded human trafficking as one of the most terrible evils plaguing the world. Divine intervention: Pope Francis, seen in the Vatican earlier this week, attacked the Sicilian mafia families for their role in human trafficking and prostitution . ‘They cannot make our brothers slaves, let us pray that these Mafiosi and Mafiose convert to God.’ Francis has repeatedly said his vision of the Catholic church is a ‘poor church for the poor,’ and encouraged clergy to work with people on society's margins and avoid having the church turn inwards onto itself. Murdered: The Rev. Giuseppe Puglisi was killed by the Sicilian mafia in 1993 for preaching against them . The ceremony for Rev Pugilisi this weekend, the beatification, is the third of the four steps to sainthood. Canonisation, the process through which a person is declared saint, has been in practice in the Catholic Church for over a 1,000 years. For someone to be considered for sainthood, the person in question must have lived a saintly life, performed a miracle, and have been dead for at least five years. The only known exception to this is Mother Theresa where the five-year rule was waived by Pope John Paul II. Once this is fulfilled, a bishop can give permission to open up an investigation into the virtues of the individual - step one - who is then declared a 'Servant of God'. When enough information has been gathered by a congregation, normally the one where the candidate died or is buried, an appeal is made to the Pope to proclaim the person 'Venerable' - step two. The beatification - step three - is a statement by the Catholic Church that the saint-to-be is definitely in heaven, becoming 'Blessed'. After the beatification, a second - post-humous - miracle must occurs and be proven to have been the result of the saint-to-be's intervention. When this is fulfilled, the Pope can declare the person a saint.","Pope Francis denounced the mafia for their role in human trafficking .

Galfy's body was found two days later. Their earlier encounter was caught on surveillance video. The 73-year-old was found severely beaten and wearing only his underwear and socks by police, who went to his home to check on his well-being.

Adam Austin was suspended from his job at Morrisons after he refused to take off a Help for Heroes bracelet and a poppy . Morrisons has sparked outrage by suspending a checkout assistant for wearing a Help for Heroes wristband and poppy badge in tribute to murdered soldier Lee Rigby. Father-of-two Adam Austin was escorted off the supermarket’s premises and told he faced disciplinary action after he refused to remove the items. The 28-year-old said he was left feeling embarrassed and angry by the incident, adding: ‘I was disappointed and partly furious. 'I have got friends in the Army and friends who have been in the Army. I wore them out of respect.’ Mr Austin, who has worked at the Morrisons branch in Portsmouth, Hampshire, for 19 months, posted a picture of his disciplinary letter alongside his badge and band on Facebook. The post quickly went viral and sparked an angry backlash against Morrisons, with many Facebook and Twitter users calling for a boycott of the store and branding it a ‘disgrace’ and ‘disgusting’. Speaking at the Portsmouth home he shares with partner Susan Saunders and their two sons, Mr Austin said he had wanted to show support for Drummer Rigby’s family. He said he was stunned when his managers asked him to remove the wristband and a small metal poppy because they did not adhere to the company’s dress code. He said: ‘I had been wearing the poppy all week and no one had said anything. When my bosses noticed it they told me to take it off. The check-out manager asked me to take my band off in front of customers. I was fuming. I was then removed from my check-out and I was told I was not allowed to wear it.' Mr Austin refused to take off the poppy badge after he was told it was not part of the Morrisons staff dress standards . Mr Austin was sent this letter after he was suspended from his job at Morrisons for refusing to remove the poppy badge and his Help for Heroes bracelet . He said: ‘I am a patriotic person and I . believe in our soldiers and what they do for our country. The store . manager asked if it was worth losing my job over. ‘I then got escorted off the building by the manager. It was so embarrassing.’ The disciplinary letter, which . forbids Mr Austin from attending work or contacting his colleagues, . summons him to a disciplinary hearing on Friday where he is expected to . learn his fate. A Morrisons spokesman said the . company had reviewed its guidelines since the online backlash and had . decided to allow staff in non-food preparation areas to wear a . registered charity wristband. Mr Austin has been suspended from the Morrisons store in Portsmouth following the incident . He said: ‘We understand it is important for many people to show support for our Armed Forces. 'Colleagues working in non-fresh food preparation food areas will now be permitted to wear a registered charity wristband.’ How this applies to Mr Austin is unclear, as he is employed in a fresh food preparation area as well as at the checkouts. Morrisons said Mr Austin remained suspended pending the outcome of Friday’s disciplinary hearing. Former Tory MP Louise Mensch wrote on . Twitter: ‘Hey, @Morrisons, you are a disgrace suspending a staffer for . wearing a poppy. Boycott Morrisons.’ Shoppers flooded the store’s Facebook . page with angry comments. One user, Michael Smith, wrote: ‘I am totally . disgusted with Morrisons’ attitude.

Thousands of others . were sent running for their lives. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Suspect: Police believe this man is one of at least two behind the gunshots that caused the 4/20 pot rally panic in Denver . Police . reportedly spent Sunday morning poring over video footage from the 4/20 . celebration in the hopes of finding the culprit and had posted the . Youtube footage, under the title 'Denver 420 Rally Shooting Crowd and . Interviews' by Sunday afternoon. Denver police have turned the case over to their gang unit, but Jackson told the Denver Post it is not yet clear if the crime was gang-related. 'They have their ears to the ground and take care of this sort of thing,' Jackson said. One bystander said there was no room for doubt in the matter. 'It . was absolutely gang-related,' said Andrew Lindsley, who told the Denver . Post he watched as two men strode 'aggressively through the crowd' just . before shots were heard. Worse fear: Tens of thousands ran in fear after several shots were heard fired and some cried that an explosion had gone off according to witnesses . Emergency response: Denver Paramedics, police officers and good samaritans work to help a shooting victim Civic Center Park in Denver on Saturday during the 4/20 pot rally . Prepared: One of the two victims is seen carried away from the scene that was heavily staffed by law enforcement officers and paramedics in light of Monday's bombing at the Boston Marathon . The witnesses and other celebrants, meanwhile, were still wracked from the Boston . Marathon bombing that killed three on Monday, and described mixed recounts . of what they heard, some saying they heard three shots fired while . others saying up to eight. 'We were standing just in front of the . stage when we heard three loud pops, we don't know what it was, we . couldn't see anything, and right away people started stampeding and . running towards us, knocking booths over,' event goer Sarina Romero told . KDVR. 'That was when we . saw police running toward it, guns drawn, 15-20 police officers all . heading in that direction where the shots came from in front of the . music stage, right in the center of the crowd,' she said. 'Some people . were yelling ""explosion,"" some people were yelling, ""gunshots."" We . couldn't really find if it was coming from the stage or from the side . because there were just so many people literally just running at . people,' a witness named Kyle told 7News. Panic: As many as 80,000 marijuana smokers ran for their lives in Denver after shots rang out ultimately injuring at least two people . Injuries: One victim was shot in the leg and another sustained unknown injuries at Civic Center Park as tens of thousands celebrated the counterculture holiday known as 4/20 . Laura Forduno who was one of the thousands running from the scene told the Denver Post she saw one of the victims lying on a street corner. 'There was a gentleman on the floor, lying there, and he was not moving,' Forduno said. 'It was chaos.' Dean Zimmerman told the paper that he . was one of a few who stopped to help the man after he appeared to have . been shot in his left thigh. 'I was talking to him, telling him, you're gonna be OK, you're gonna be OK,' Zimmerman said. He says the man appeared calm, and even 'cool about it,' in Zimmerman's words. With a nation on edge following . Monday's attack, the city reported having ample security on hand for . Saturday's festivities, including a police force on motorcycles, horses . and undercover who were joined by private security, volunteers and . paramedics. Police said . earlier this week they're especially focused on crowd security in light . of the attacks that killed three at the Boston finish line. 'We're aware of the events in .

Backup: With a nation on edge following the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday the city had ample security on hand for Saturday's festivities . 'It was in the back of my head,' one event goer told KDVR of his initial worry of coming out today. Saturday was the first 4/20 celebration since Colorado and Washington made pot legal for recreation use. Reggae . music filled the air, and so did the smell of marijuana, as celebrants . gathered by mid-morning in a park just beside the state Capitol. Few . police were initially in sight, though public marijuana use is still . prohibited here. 'People aren't afraid to come out and celebrate it, the way they used to be,' said 52-year-old Charles Bade of Denver. Bade carried a tie-dyed flag with a . big cannabis leaf and wore a garland of fake marijuana leaves around his . neck. He said he's been marking 4/20 privately since he was 11 but . decided to join this year's public smoke-out to celebrate the votes by . Colorado and Washington last year to defy federal drug law and make pot . legal. Authorities generally look the other way at public pot smoking here on April 20. Organizers say the event — which drew . 50,000 people last year — could bring a record 80,000 this year, since . it's the first celebration since Colorado and Washington voted to make . pot legal for recreational use. Packed: The city expected up to 80,000 people to pack this park on Saturday with the crowd and smoke seen covering it from end-to-end before shots rang out . Taken over: Members of a crowd numbering tens of thousands smoke marijuana and listen to live music, at the Denver 420 pro-marijuana rally that took over Civic Center Park . 4/20: April 20th has for years been a celebration of marijuana counterculture, and the 2013 Denver rally draw larger crowds than previous years . Group . smoke-outs were also planned Saturday from New York to San Francisco. The origins of the number '420' as a code for pot are murky, but the . drug's users have for decades marked the date 4/20 as a day to use pot . together. Denver's . celebration this year also featured the nation's first open-to-all . Cannabis Cup, a marijuana competition patterned after one held in . Amsterdam. Similar . to a beer or wine festival, pot growers compete for awards for taste, . appearance and potency of their weed. Denver's event, sponsored by High . Times magazine, has sold more than 5,000 tickets. Snoop . Lion, the new reggae- and marijuana-loving persona of the rapper better . known as Snoop Dogg, received a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' from High . Times. And the hip-hop group Cypress Hill was set to perform a sold-out . concert Saturday evening in Colorado's iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Colorado and Washington are still . waiting for a federal response to the votes and are working on setting . up commercial pot sales, which are still limited to people with certain . medical conditions. In the meantime, pot users are free to share and use . the drug in small amounts. A . citizen advocacy group that opposes marijuana legalization, Smart . Colorado, warned in a statement that public 4/20 celebrations 'send a . clear message to the rest of the nation and the world about what . Colorado looks like.' 'Does . the behavior of the participants in these events reflect well on our . state?' asked the head of Smart Colorado, Henny Lasley. The . organizer of Denver's 4/20 rally, Miguel Lopez, said the holiday is . more than an excuse to get high — it's also a political statement by . people who want to see the end of marijuana prohibition. 'You . don't have to smoke weed to go to 4/20 rallies. You don't have to be . gay to go to a Pride festival. You don't have to be Mexican to celebrate . Cinco de Mayo,' Lopez said.

Get Me Out of Here! in which a contestant’s child was used as a prize was condemned as offensive yesterday by the TV watchdog. Regulator Ofcom said it had ‘serious concerns’ about the episode in which Charlie Brooks failed to win the chance to be reunited with her daughter Kiki, seven. The ruling was praised by media campaigners as a ‘warning shot’ to other reality programmes not to use children in the same way. Shocked upon realising: EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks, 31, was offered the chance to win luxuries such as food and clean clothes by opening one of five doors - not knowing her child was standing behind one . Ofcom launched an investigation into the episode in November last year after EastEnders actress Miss Brooks, 31, was offered the chance to win luxuries such as food and clean clothes by opening one of five doors – not realising her child was standing behind one. The tearful soap star later told viewers the disappointment was ‘heartbreaking’. Kiki, who had not seen her mother for 18 days, had been ordered to stay silent but afterwards appeared distressed. At the time, ITV was accused of cruelty. In its judgment, Ofcom said: ‘The . appearance of a seven-year-old child placed in such a scenario would . have gone far beyond the likely expectations of the audience.’ Back together: The tearful soap star, pictured with Kiki last December, later told viewers the disappointment was 'heartbreaking' Ofcom accepted ITV’s claim that Kiki had exhibited disappointment rather than ‘real distress’. It decided the broadcaster had been careful to protect her emotional welfare and said she was looked after by her grandmother while Miss Brooks was in the jungle. But the watchdog attacked the premise of the stunt, saying it would have caused a ‘significant level of offence’. It added: ‘We considered the editorial premise of this challenge would have been potentially offensive: in effect a seven-year-old child was being offered as a prize.’ Vivienne Pattison, of campaign group Mediawatch-UK, said: ‘We will never know exactly how upset the child was. But it was deeply inappropriate to use a child as a prize. ‘I’m not surprised viewers were upset to see a daughter being dangled in front of her mother like that. I hope other reality shows take this as a warning shot.’ A spokesman for Miss Brooks declined to comment. The BBC was also rebuked over its treatment of children by Ofcom after a girl of 11 vomited during a TV eating competition on Dick and Dom’s Hoopla! on CBBC. Two youngsters were made to drink a blend of custard, mayonnaise, spaghetti hoops and apple sauce and one of them was sick in a bucket. Ofcom found the BBC had failed to protect the girl’s emotional welfare and said the clip, screened last November, was offensive because it appeared she was put under ‘inappropriate pressure’ and was distressed. Ofcom said a meeting to discuss the welfare of child participants on the BBC had been postponed until the conclusion of the CBBC inquiry, but that it would now take place.","Ofcom has 'serious concerns' about episode of ITV show last November .

'When I met them they are fun, outgoing happy people,' Kokal, who first met Lambright at her old job at a dentist's. 'For such a sad thing to go through their spirits never seem down.' Delicate: Ruby Love Lambright weighed just 1.6 pounds when she was born three months early . Newborn: Ruby, who is pictured right with her father Travis, underwent heart surgery and blood transfusions . Fighter: She is now 7 pounds but her parents face medical bills exceeding $10,000 for her treatment . Kokal, who has taken heart-melting photographs of the baby girl, offered free Christmas portraits over two days and simply asked that families donated to the Lambrights in exchange. She explained her idea on Facebook - and could barely keep up with the number of families who wanted to help. 'I'm receiving more than I have ever . received all of my Christmas life. Having done this and it makes me want . to give more,' Kokal told Kare11. Travis Lambright, Ruby's father, added of the generosity: 'It's just flooring, mind boggling.' After the hundreds of dollars the family . has raised themselves, Kokal added $2,000 to the pot. And, as the word . of the photographer's kindness spreads, other strangers are digging . deep. Kindness of a stranger: To raise funds, photographer Tiffany Kokal offered free portraits for donations . Joy: Strangers donated more than $2,000 to the Lambrights, who are pictured in the NICU . Mini: When she was born, Ruby was so small that she fitted into her mother's hand . 'We certainly never thought of asking for help on Facebook but we are so overjoyed people would ask us to do so,' the family wrote on Facebook. 'Lauren has been forced to be out of work a . lot longer than we ever anticipated to care for Ruby and we have been . trying to cut back everywhere we can. Travis works hard to provide but with the unexpected expenses rolling in it can be hard to make it all work. 'There are a few areas of need and you can choose to support us in anyway that tugs at your heart because we appreciate any little bit of help we get so very much!' Ruby is still using a breathing monitor but now weighs more than seven pounds. With dad: Ruby's parents expressed their shock at the generosity of strangers to help pay their bills . Safe: They said they are looking forward to recounting the story to Ruby when she is older . The Lambrights said that they can't wait to recount the story to Ruby when she is old enough, to show her how special she is. 'I realized that I want her to know that I believe she is a gift and not just a gift but the BEST gift in the whole wide world,' Lauren wrote of Ruby in an entry on her CaringBridge site. 'This whole experience has shown me just how fragile her life is and I am looking forward to every dirty diaper and sleepless night because I will be with her and she will be with me and that is just absolutely amazing!'

The keen-nosed canine detected a trail and followed it through woods and across fields leading them straight to the suspect close to the entrance of Bristol Airport - two miles from where the car was found abandoned. The pair turned up as the wanted man was being quizzed by another police team who had seen him acting suspiciously at the side of a main road. A 28-year-old man was later charged with theft and four-year-old Troy got a public pat of the back from Chief Constable Nick Gargan. He tweeted: 'More great police dog work overnight.

Fairytale: This unusual property, nicknamed the 'Hansel and Gretel house,' has gone on sale for $11m (£7.2m). The building - which is a famous landmark in Bay Ridge in Brooklyn - New York, was built in 1917 for a former shipping magnate . Quirky: The building has thick patchwork boulder walls, cast-iron doorknobs, a stained-glass window, beamed ceilings and a thatched roof. It is expected to attract keen interest from buyers looking for a quirky home . Luxury: The house has retained lots of its original features, including a luxurious lounge with carved wood panelling, beamed roof and eye catching glass work . The six-bedroom home was previously owned by two sisters between the 1940s and 1970s but the pair only lived in the service quarters. That is the reason current owners Jerry and Diane Fishman believe the house has stayed so true to its original design and in such good condition. Mr Fishman, who has owned the house since 1985, said: 'My mother used to push me in my stroller past the house and one time I got out and tried to get in. 'When I was a student I studied right across the road and would just sit in class staring out the window at the house in a trance. My grades suffered. 'On my first date with Diane we drove past and I told her 'one day I'm going to own that house.'' Dream home: The property was bought during the 1980s by Jerry Fishman who had loved it since childhood. It is expected to attract interest from buyers looking for a quirky home . Unusual: The building is more like a country cottage than a New York town house. It was owned for many years by sisters who lived only in the servants' quarters . Historic: The home's dining room would not look out of place in an English castle with its stone fireplace and wood panel walls . Mr Fishman said he finally got a chance to buy his dream home when his broker called him during the mid-1980s to tell him it was up for sale. 'Everyone in the neighbourhood knew I wanted to live there,' he said.'The day we moved in kids would run up and ring the doorbell for a look inside. It was relentless so after a while we had to cut the wire - we've lived without a doorbell ever since.'

"By . Olivia Williams . PUBLISHED: . 13:51 EST, 25 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:19 EST, 28 February 2013 . The real slave trade: An early depiction of what John Murrell, a notorious slave and horse thief, may have looked like . Director Quentin Tarantino is famed for his gory subject matter but Django Unchained, his film about the violence of the slave trade before the American Civil War is more realistic than many critics would realise. The Oscar-winning film is set in 1858, and reflects the contemporary mood of mob rule and casual violence. In the film Django, played by Jamie . Foxx, is a freed slave who journeys to reclaim his bride Broomhilda, played . by Kerry Washington, from a slave owner, with plenty of bloody battles along the way. Two new history books about American slavery suggest that Tarantino's nightmare vision of the period is not that far off the mark. The books paint a picture of how violence and fear pervaded American society at that time. The summer of 1835 was a particularly lawless one. Widespread panic broke out in the Southern states, after a man named  Virgil Stewart wrote a sensational pamphlet that claimed a slave rebellion plot, financed by highwaymen and . Northern Abolitionists, was imminent. Rumours rapidly spread that this plot was true according to The Daily Beast. Scroll down for video . Brutal slave history as shown by contemporaries: An Engraving of a White Male Beating a Black Slave Tied to a Tree circa 1860 . At the time Virgil Stewart was . pursuing John Murrell, one of American history's most infamous bandits known as the 'great land pirate of Tennessee', . on suspicion he had stolen two slaves with him. Stewart alleged that this slave rebellion was going to be led by Murrell, a professional horse thief and slave stealer, planned for Christmas Day that year. People living around the Mississippi River and in Tennessee lived in fear of contact the 'Murrell Klan' though so much folklore surrounds them the full extent of Murrell's crimes remain hazy. He was first arrested in 1822, when he would have been about sixteen, and there began his life as an outlaw.  The local papers were terrified of him, believing to have hundreds of men in his thrall. According to tradition, Murrell's band of thieves used to meet in a forest in Arkansas, just across the Mississippi River, where they formed their often murderous plans. Among many grizzly crimes Murrell was believed to have murdered the whole crew of a flatboat to steal the goods on board. Poignant climax of Django Unchained: The heroine Broomhilda is flogged against a tree at her plantation . In . the ensuing panic of a Murrell plot in Mississippi, nervous white Southerners formed . vigilante groups, seeking out potential collaborators. They whipped . confessions out of slaves that they were involved in the plot, and they were hanged. How many slaves were killed altogether is not known, but the number is likely to be in the dozens. The slaves' confessions also . implicated white men in the alleged Murrell plot. A self-appointed local . committee handed out their idea of justice and hanged five of them. More...

When . a prominent doctor was gunned down in the fracas, a mob lynched five . professional gamblers they believed to be responsible. In many plantations that summer dozens more men were executed, out of fear that they were implicated with gangs of slave thieves. None of this was lost on another subject of an Oscar-winning film of the year - future president Abraham Lincoln.

Silent suspect: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev stopped talking when he was read his rights by police officials . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev reportedly showed . no fear or any of sign of remorse during a makeshift court hearing held . in his hospital room earlier this week. The second Boston Marathon bomber was . still wounded and unable to talk during the hearing on Monday, but he . didn't express any emotion when he was read his Miranda rights. The only movements he made during the . Constitutionally-mandated interaction were when he mouthed the word . 'no' when asked if he could afford a lawyer, and when he nodded his head . to note that he did understand his rights. According to a NBC source that was . familiar with the controversial interaction, the 19-year-old suspect's . heart monitor did not register even the slightest blip during the tense . exchange, even when he was informed that he could receive the death . penalty for his crimes. 'Over the weekend, he’s in and out of . lucidity. He’s got — he’s on medication, he’s talking, but he’s not . talking, he’s unconscious, he’s going for medical procedures,' Congressman Mike Rogers told MSNBC on Thursday, having been briefed . because of his role as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. In the official records, however, his state of mind was deemed sufficient for the proceedings to take place. According to the transcript of the . interaction, Judge Marianne Bowler reportedly said: 'I find the . defendant is alert, mentally competent and lucid. He is aware of the . nature of the proceedings.' The legal proceedings came at a . pivotal time in the investigation, as he was reportedly communicating . with police via notepad until the moment he was read his rights, after . which he stopped communicating. Suspects: Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) died in an altercation with police but his younger brother Dzhokhar (right) is alive and in police custody at a Boston hospital . It has been revealed that Dzhokhar . Tsarnaev, 19, initially confessed to authorities that he and his older . brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, carried out the attacks during 16-hours . of questioning over the weekend. Dzhokhar . has been communicating with law enforcement officials by writing on a . pad after suffering an injury to his throat during the frenzied manhunt . for him which renders him unable to talk. However, . the moment he was read his rights on Monday - which as a citizen of the . United States entitle him to the constitutional right to remain silent . and seek a lawyer - he stopped communicating. Indeed, . it has been claimed that federal agents were surprised when a . magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office . entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, four officials . and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him. This apparent confusion came after the White House decided against treating Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant. It is unclear as to whether this will . matter in court as the FBI says Tsarnaev has already confessed to a witness. A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said: 'Before being advised of his rights, . the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, . Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the . attack'. Tsarnaev said he was behind the devastating terrorist attack. He spoke to police from his hospital bed. Whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a controversial issue in the U.S . Reflecting on the scenes of destruction at Boston marathon, Vice President Joe Biden condemned the bombing suspects as 'two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis' The debate over whether suspected . terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a sticking point. Many Repuplicans believe they hinder intelligence gathering. The Department of Justice has said . investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other . threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. Investigators have found . pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and are analyzing . them, officials said. One official described the detonator as 'close-controlled,' meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs. A piece of remote control equipment has been found amongst the debris at the scene of the bombing. Experts say it would have been triggered just blocks away from the site of the bomb . Confused reports about the shootout in a Boston backyard have emerged. Officials now claim that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was unarmed as he hid in boat in Watertown. This contradicts Boston Police Commissioner's account of hour-long firefight with Tsarnaev . Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital . from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt last Friday. Police had . previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an . hour last Friday before they captured him inside a boat in a suburban Boston neighbourhood. But yesterday, two unnamed officials . said that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions . about the gunfire and how he was injured. The report contradicts the Boston police department's own account of Dzhokar Tsarnaev's capture - after commissioner Ed Davies describes a firefight between him and officers before the terror suspect was captured. More than 4,000 mourners at the . Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police . officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing . suspects. Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice . President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as 'two twisted, . perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.' U.S. Vice President Joe Biden gives his respects to police officers at memorial services for officer Sean Collier, who authorities say was shot dead by the Boston Marathon bombing suspect . Mr Biden paid tribute to officer Sean Collier's family: 'The moment will come when the memory of . Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK. The purpose of . terror is to instill fear. You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.' Investigators have said the . brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on . the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist . group. Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in . Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev questioned for 16 hours before read Miranda rights .

Embattled football star Manti Te'o was not among the dozens of college football prospects who are on their way to professional careers in the sport. It is believed that the notorious fake girlfriend scandal earlier this year presented too much of a distraction around Te'o, a former college standout, and NFL suitors decided to pass on him. It is another setback from a star estimated to be among the top 24 in this year's crop of prospects, and missing out in the first round may cost him lucrative sponsorship deals. Picked: The Minnesota Vikings selected Manti Te'o in the first round with the 29th pick overall .

Also not helping Te'o was less-than stellar performance during the BCS championship game against Alabama, which raised many concerns about how he would handle himself in the NFL. He also came up short during the NFL scouting combine in February, where he ran a 4.82-second 40-yard dash, a slow time for a linebacker. Unpicked: Te'o, a former Notre Dame linebacker, was not present at Radio City Music Hall for the draft, opting instead to stay at his home in Hawaii . The former Notre Dame linebacker was not . present at Radio City Music Hall for the draft, opting instead to stay . at his home in Hawaii. The teams believed to have taken the most interest in Te'o - the Chicago Bears (20th pick) and the Minnesota Vikings (23rd pick) - decided to go with and tackle Kyle Long and cornerback Shariff Floyd, respectively. The Vikings had another shot at a first-rounder with the 25th pick, but went with Florida State University cornerback Xavier Rhodes instead. Minnesota was given yet another chance to select Te'o after trading with the New England Patriots to obtain the 29th pick, but shocked Te'o supporters when they selected wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson from the University of Tennessee. Te'o will now have to wait until Friday, when the second and third rounds of the draft will begin. Even before the draft started, football fans could not resist taking digs at Te'o on social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook. One user tweeted a picture of an empty chair with the caption: 'Waiting with manti teo's gf waiting to see what team will draft him.' Another posted: 'Manti Te'o has a better chance of getting a call from his fake girlfriend rather than an NFL team.' Te'o's tragic story about his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, tugged on America's heartstrings last September as Notre Dame began their push into the BCS championships. Kekua supposedly died around September 12 from leukemia after recovering from a near fatal car crash - just six hours after his grandmother passed away. Among those that paid tribute to Kekua was CBS, which showed a picture of her on This Morning with a direct quote she has supposedly said to Te'o: 'Babe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you'll stay there and you'll play and you'll honor me through the way you play.' Top picks: Eric Fisher, pictured left, and Luke Joeckel, pictured right with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, were the No. 1 and 2 picks overall . Humor: Several Twitter users could not resist a joke at Manti Te'o's expense . Fake: The Twitter account of Lennay Kekua was made using photos of Diane O'Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo who claimed she had never met nor spoken to Te'o . But it wasn't until a groundbreaking article on Deadspin.com that Lennay was exposed as an elaborate hoax. The scheme was found to be orchestrated by Roanaiah Tuiasosopo, who admitted that he used phony Twitter and Facebook accounts to get Te'o's attention, win his affection and carry on an exclusive online relationship. In those fake accounts was a picture of a woman, later identified as Diane O'Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo who claimed that she had never met or spoken to Te'o. Te'o claimed that he was a victim, and was not in on the scandal. In an interview with Katie Couric in late January, Te'o said that he briefly lied about his online girlfriend, after discovering she didn't exist. But he maintained that he had no part in creating the hoax. Deceived: Earlier this week Te'o emotionally . denied he was involved in any sort of cover-up while instead admitting . he believed Lennay Kekua, played by Tuiasosopo, was real . Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te'o said he believed that 'Lennay' had died of cancer. 'You stuck to the script. And you knew that something was amiss, Manti,' the talk show host said. He replied: 'Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on September 12.' Couric also asked Te'o point blank: 'Are you gay?' Cracking a smile, he responded: 'No. Far from it. Far from it.' The Te'o episode boosted Couric's ratings by 30 per cent. Self-indulging: Tuiasosopo said that he fell . 'deeply, romantically in love' with Te'o though he was playing him for a . fool while pretending to be a woman . In an interview with Dr Phil McGraw, Tuiasosopo admitted that he was gay and fell 'deeply, romantically in love' with the Notre Dame linebacker even though he was deceiving him. Tuiasosopo also confirmed that it was him impersonating 'Lennay,' despite the fact that voicemail recordings sound high-pitched and feminine. Since the Couric interview, Te'o has mostly stayed out of the limelight, but appeared at the NFL scouting combine in February and was pictured during various workouts. 1 – Kansas City Chiefs select Eric Fisher, an outside tackle out of Central Michigan University . 2 – Jacksonville Jaguars select Luke Joeckel, an outside tackle . from Texas A&M . 3 – Miami Dolphins select Dion Jordan, a defensive end out of the .

Country star Billy Currington has landed behind bars after police say he may have videotaped himself chasing a 70-year-old tour boat captain and threatening to ‘finish him off’ in a foul-mouth tirade. The boat captain, Charles Harvey Ferrelle, and his two passengers told police Currington was holding a camera when he became outraged and made the threats April 15 after they passed him on the dock of the singer’s $3.5million waterfront mansion near Tybee Island. ‘They were in fear of this man and a possible attack against Mr. Ferrelle, and possibly everyone there, as his behavior was “out of control” as described by all three persons,’ Savannah-Chatham County Police Detective Alycia Rice wrote in an affidavit filed in Chatham County Superior Court Thursday. Currington, 39, turned himself in this . afternoon at the county jail, where he was indicted on charges of . making terroristic threats and abuse of an elderly person. Sheriff's . Cpl. Rhonda Bryant Elleby said bond had been set at $27,700. Each of . the charges is a felony that carries a sentence of one to five years in . prison. Police got a warrant . to search Currington's home Tuesday and seized four digital video . files, 27 digital photos and a memory card. The affidavit said police believed Currington might have recorded the profanity-filled confrontation. Currington is a native of the Georgia coast. He has had six hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart since 2003, among them ‘Pretty Good At Drinkin' Beer,’ ‘That's How Country Boys Roll’ and ‘People Are Crazy.’ Anger management: Currington (left) is accused of yelling profanities at tour boat captain Charles Harvey Ferrelle (right) and his two passengers, flipping them the bird and threatening to 'finish off' Ferrelle . His castle: Police say Currington became enraged that the boat captain had brought tourists to look at his lavish $3.5million waterfront home near Tybee Island . The singer's attorney, Alex Zipperer, did not immediately return phone messages. In a court filing April 19, the attorney said Currington denied ‘each and every allegation’ from Ferrelle. Two days after the incident, the singer sent a message to more than 200,000 Twitter followers saying ‘Harrassing (sic) artists often at their home by boat should be illegal. thas all i know.’ Currington thanked fans Wednesday on Twitter for their support but said he couldn't comment because of the ongoing investigation. Lori Christian, a spokeswoman for Universal Music Group in Nashville, declined to comment Thursday. Universal owns Currington's record label. Ferrelle, who conducts boat tours from Tybee Island east of Savannah, told police he was cruising past Currington's home on Tybee Creek at around 1.30pm when his two passengers told Ferrelle someone on the property was yelling at them and ‘flipping a double bird,’ the affidavit said. Music career: Currington, 39, has had six hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart since 2003, among them 'Pretty Good At Drinkin' Beer' Ferrelle told police he was floating with the current far from the docks, but he throttled up and moved away when he saw the angry man, whom he later identified from a photograph as Currington. Ferrelle told officers that when he passed by again on the return trip, Currington got in his own boat with a camera and chased him to the dock where Ferrelle keeps his tour boat. ‘If I hadn't gotten into my slip fast enough, I believe he would have run me over,’ Ferrelle told police. Ferrelle and his passengers told police Currington pulled up to the dock, but didn't get out of his boat. They said he called Ferrelle foul names and said, ‘I am going to (expletive) you up you mother (expletive) old man,’ according to the police affidavit. It says Currington told Ferrelle that he and his brother would ‘catch him in the river’ and ‘finish him off.’ A second charter boat captain, Elizabeth Johnson, later told police Currington made similar threats to her and a passenger last October when they were fishing not far from the singer's home. A separate police report filed soon after the incident indicates that those living at Currington's home had problems with boats passing by too closely or too fast. A woman who said she was the caretaker of an elderly man at the same address called police to complain a passing boat nearly knocked the man off the home's dock and into the water. The police report said the woman was talking about the events that led to Currington chasing after the tour boat. Troubled past: Currington said in a 2007 interview that he sometimes struggled to control his anger as a result of suffering childhood abuse . ‘Well, what is it we can do to keep people from coming up on our docks or swamping our docks?’ the woman asked. Currington’s sprawling waterfront home on San Marco Drive boasts six bedrooms, six bathrooms nad an attached garage sitting on a 871,200-square-foot lot. The mansion described on the real estate site Zillow.com as a 'remarkable coastal property for the water enthusiast,' was built in 2005 and last sold in April 2011 for $3.5million. Currington told The Tennessean newspaper in 2007 that he sometimes struggled to control his anger as a result of suffering childhood abuse while growing up in Rincon, near Savannah. In the interview, conducted after he completed a 30-day trauma recovery program in Arizona, Currington said a small part of him remained ‘hurt, sad and furious.’ ‘When he comes out, he comes out very quickly and it goes away very quickly,’ Currington told the newspaper. ‘And in those instances, that rage can destroy relationships, whether it's with a girlfriend or a business partner or a fan. It doesn't take long to screw it all up.’","Billy Currington, 39, was indicted on charges of making terroristic threats and abuse of a person older than 65 years old .

Despite losing her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands in a vicious attack by a rampaging chimpanzee in 2009, face transplant recipient Charla Nash says she feels at home in her new skin. The brave 58-year-old woman, who nearly died in the horrific mauling, told the Hartford Courant exclusively that she feels no different than she did before the attack. ‘I just feel like it’s my face,’ she said. ‘It’s just not working real good.’ Brave face: After a full face transplant, chimpanzee maul victim Charla Nash is making a remarkable recovery and is gaining feeling in her new face . Before and after: Pictured before the attack, left, and after she received a full-face transplant, right . Ms Nash, a single mother from Stamford, Connecticut, told the Courant that she’s regaining movements in her face and can express herself with various motions. ‘Every day, my muscles get better,’ she said. Sandra Herold, who owned the 200-lb chimp Travis, died of an aneurism in 2010. Ms Nash said that if she could say anything to her former boss and friend, she would say she is ‘sorry that all this happened. And, nothing we can change now.’ However, she added that Herold was ‘a trouble person’ that was more worried about her pet – who was shot and killed after the attack – than she was of her. In past interviews, Ms Nash revealed that having a new face allowed her simple human pleasures – she has regained her sense of smell and can eat again. Recovery: Six months in, Ms Nash showed off her face transplant surgery. Surgeons spent 20 hours re-building her features . Reconstruction: In the attack, her eyes, nose, and lips were mauled off . She is even regaining sensation in her forehead, cheeks, eyebrow, and nose. But most of all, she’s learning how to smile. ‘It creases up here,’ Ms Nash told the Courant as she pointed at her mouth. In the interview, Ms Nash also spoke of long years of rehabilitation, and the hope of regaining some semblance of independence. 'I have to depend on a lot of help. My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.' -Charla Nash . ‘I don’t know what the future’s doing (sic) to bring… so I don’t get my hopes up,’ Ms Nash said, . though she added that she wants to progress far enough that she can again ride horses and live in her own house. She said she misses simple things – like being able to bargain hunt, bask in the sunshine, or even look at her 20-year-old daughter, Brianna. ‘I have to depend on a lot of help,’ she said. ‘My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.’ She also gets phantom pains in her hands, despite the fact that they were removed after the 2009 attack. Haunting image: Ms Nash is seen posing with the chimp a year before the attack . Courageous: The survivor first revealed her mauled face on the Oprah Winfrey show; before the surgery, she kept a veil over her face . Transplants added in surgery later had to be removed because of dangerous complications. In an interview with ABC 7 last month, Ms Nash – who likes being called Charlie – said she doesn’t want anybody’s pity. Furious George: She was attacked by 200-lb chimpanzee Travis in 2009 . ‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me,’ she said. ‘I want to be like everyone else.’ There are very real financial concerns as well. Her surgery, care, and rehabilitation have cost millions. According to the Courant, there is a $150million case pending against the state of Connecticut for allegedly not protecting its citizens from an unsafe creature. One state employee reportedly wrote in a memo that Travis’ attack was ‘an accident waiting to happen.’ ‘I hope that I do get my day in court,’ she said. She has been told by doctors that she needs to work on bulking up, as she is still quite thin for her 5ft 10in frame. Ms Nash, who was blinded in the 2009 attack, was fitted with brown glass eyes and hopes to get a double hand transplant after the first one failed. She received a revolutionary full-face transplant at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston nearly two years after the attack. The operation – performed by a team of more than 30 surgeons and nurses – and subsequent recovery were widely covered. Prior to the surgery, she hid her face under a veil, saying that she chose to wear it ‘so I don’t scare people.’","Now 58-year-old Charla Nash horrifically mauled by chimpanzee in 2009 .

The number of drugs available through the government¿s flagship Cancer Drugs Fund has now been cut from 50 to 27 by NHS England, a new body headed by Sir David Nicholson . The number of cancer treatments available to patients has been halved on a new national list. The move – described as ‘alarming’ and ‘a step backwards’ by campaigners – could mean many new patients are unable to benefit from the Government’s flagship Cancer Drugs Fund. The £200million-a-year idea, launched in April 2011, was intended to provide life-extending help for sufferers and has led to more than 25,000 patients in England getting drugs which are not available on the NHS because they are not approved by NICE, the rationing body. But the number of drugs available through the fund has now been cut from 50 to 27 by NHS England. This means the number of cancers that can be treated has been cut from 129 to 65. Some of the drugs have been cut from the list because they have been given the go-ahead by NICE in recent months and can now be prescribed normally by doctors. But other treatments no longer approved include the pioneering radiation therapy given to surgeon Becky Smith, who fought to get it used routinely on the NHS after forcing her health trust into a funding U-turn over treatment for liver tumours. As a result, the treatment was approved by many regions making up the Cancer Drugs Fund. But it emerged yesterday it has been omitted from a national list from NHS England, a new body headed by Sir David Nicholson, who has faced calls for his resignation over his role in the Staffordshire Hospital scandal. Other treatments which have been removed from the list include a drug used for a wide range of blood cancers, as well as those used for leukaemia, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and brain cancer. The blood cancer drug, Rituximab, was the fourth most frequently requested treatment through the Fund last year. Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, said: ‘This appears to be a clear step backwards for cancer patients in terms of access to drugs. ‘The list of cancer drugs which will be funded has been cut in half with no explanation. We are worried that this will restrict access to drugs which were previously routinely available. ‘The Government has questions to answer about this, and we will be writing to the Prime Minister to seek urgent clarification about this.’ Mr Wilson said he was concerned by the lack of transparency over how the new list was compiled. ‘Clinicians were supposed to be in the driving seat but the centralisation of this list suggests the opposite’ he added. The Government’s aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit. But the new list has slashed treatments available to new patients, even when as many as four out of 10 regional panels had approved their use. A form of internal radiotherapy called SIR-Spheres used where bowel cancer has spread to the liver has been axed, even though previously available in the majority of regions. Around 500 patients a year could miss out as a result. Other treatments which have been removed from the list include a drug used for a wide range of blood cancers, as well as those used for leukaemia, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and brain cancer . But Professor Peter Clark, head of the . Cancer Drugs Fund, insisted patients would be better off, partly because . some of the drugs dropped from the national list had been agreed for . routine use. Instead of having to get these drugs via . the Cancer Drugs Fund with access that varied in different regions, . doctors would be able to get them normally. He said: ‘Many more patients are going to be able access these drugs from this week than could have done last week.. ‘We have not been levelling down we’ve . been levelling up.’ He said doctors could apply on behalf of individual . patients if a drug was not on the fast-track national list, but was . unable to say how long the process would take. Dr Jamie Mills, Consultant Clinical Oncologist at Nottingham University Hospital said: ‘The expectations of clinicians are that new patients will be offered the same treatments as they would have been able to receive under the Cancer Drugs Fund. ‘It is simply unacceptable that patients are being denied these life-extending treatments. ‘The Cancer Drugs Fund is the only mechanism which ensures that NHS patients in England have routine access to cancer drugs and treatments and this must continue. ‘Any changes made must ensure that cancer patients continue to have access to drugs and treatments, including SIR-Spheres if recommended by their oncologist.’ Denied: The number of drugs available through the fund has now been cut from 50 to 27 by NHS England . Almost two thirds of cancer treatments considered by Nice (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) are rejected. The future of the Cancer Drugs Fund has not been guaranteed beyond next January, when an estimated 16,000 patients could lose out each year. The ‘alarming’ move has been condemned by a group of MPs led by Alan Meale (Lab) who blamed the Government for breaking its pledge that NHS reforms would not lead to renewed restrictions on cancer drugs. They called on Ministers to urgently ensure cancer patients were not in a worse position.Mark Flannagan, Chief Executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said the list left many questions unanswered. He said ‘What we are concerned about is that these arrangements are temporary and only give bowel cancer patients limited breathing space. ‘We still need some assurance from Government that patients will continue to access the drugs that successfully treat the disease, beyond the end of the year.’ Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England, said doctors would still be able to make individual funding requests for patients even if the treatment is not on the national list. But critics say the process for such requests has not yet been organised and patients could face delays when they may have only months to live. Dr Duffy insisted the new list was a ‘national levelling up’ of the number of approved treatments. He said ‘This means more people will benefit. It is really important that we stretch every penny of the Cancer Drugs Fund so we get maximum benefit to the most people we possibly can. “This is a step forward for the Cancer Drugs Fund. In recent weeks cancer specialists from across the country have been working together to agree one national list of approved fast-track drugs for the Cancer Drugs Fund, which will then allow more uniform access to treatment and reduce variation of prescribing across the country. ‘Having one consistent method for consideration of overall clinical benefit and funding means that all applications will be assessed by the same criteria. Regional variation of the past is clearly not acceptable for patients. Clinicians can still apply for drugs to join the national list of approved fast-track cancer drugs.’","Move could mean many new patients will be unable to benefit from the government’s flagship Cancer Drugs Fund .

Kalyn Pennygraph, then 3, was riding the Techno Jump at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo last March when she slipped from under a restraint and fell off the ride. The dramatic accident was caught on tape.

John Neese, the Pennygraph family's lawyer, told Chron.com that Kaylyn was 'doing fine' almost a year after the accident. According to an injury report, the . girl boarded the ride with her brother while her mother was supervising . on the sidelines and suffered a concussion and head abrasions from the . fall.

March 2012 carnival children too short to ride alone had to be . accompanied by an adult aged 16 or over. The new rules will kick in for this year's show, according to Chron.com. The shocking video of Kalyn's tumble . emerged just days after the three-year-old girl was hurled from the . fairground ride after she slipped under the restraining bar.

Rodeo Chief Operating Officer Leroy Shafer said at the time: 'It’s a very scary-looking piece of . video. We are just thankful that this young lady was not more injured. 'It boils down to a three-year-old not knowing what to do and . was probably scared to death.' In . an initial account of the incident, the rodeo organizers had claimed . that Kalyn got on the ride with her mother and brother.

Scientists testing the lasers on Nasa rover Curiosity have discovered startling similarities to a matter found on Earth. Researchers expected the substance to contain the same minerals as rocks found elsewhere on the Red Planet, but instead learned it was chemically more akin to an unusual type found on Earth. The make-up of the rock is similar to one found on oceanic islands like Hawaii and St. Helena, as well as in continental rift zones like the Rio Grande, which extends from Colorado to Chihuahua, Mexico. More than meets the eye: The rock as more like the unusual types found on oceanic islands such a Hawaii and St Helena . Referring to rock formed from molten material, Curiosity scientist Ralf Gellert, from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, said: 'It was a bit of a surprise, what we found with this rock. 'It's igneous. But it seems to be a new kind of rock type that we encountered on Mars.' Curiosity arrived on Mars two months ago to learn if the most Earth-like planet in the solar system was suitable for microbial life. Last month, Curiosity's laser was used to zap the football-sized rock and the rover analysed the pulverised material, as well as tiny pits left behind, to determine its chemical composition. Scientists found the rock lacks magnesium and iron - elements found in igneous rock examined by previous Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The rock, named after a Jet . Propulsion Laboratory rover engineer, Jake Matijevic, who died shortly . after Curiosity's landing, was also rich in feldspar-like minerals, . which provided clues about the rock's history.

A grandfather who harassed a neighbour by parking cars with rude number plates has been jailed for a year. It is the second time grandfather Barrie Barker, 58, has been locked up for breaching an anti-social behaviour order imposed in a long-running dispute. The row began over cars on and around Barker's home in a quiet cul-de-sac in Lundwood, Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Barker was already subject to an ASBO for harassing former magistrate Barry Roddis when he parked cars in front of Mr Roddis' home with the number plates R 5OUL and GRA55 R. Barrie Barker (left), pictured with the number plates he left on a car outside the home of former magistrate Barry Roddis (right), has been jailed for a year for breaching his ASBO . He was jailed for four months for breaches of the ASBO in March, 2010 and has now been jailed for a year for further breaches of the ASBO. Mr Roddis, 72, and his wife Phyllis, 71, have suffered nine years of abuse from Barker and Mr Roddis has suffered a nervous breakdown, a court heard. He and his wife moved into the street 12 years ago and the abuse started when Mr Roddis was asked to speak up on behalf of the residents about Barker mending cars on his driveway. In the latest breaches of his ASBO, Barker has smashed their garden fence, stalked them when they went out, blocked their driveway and shouted verbal abuse. The Roddis' were forced to install audio CCTV cameras in their front and back gardens to gather evidence against Barker. Dispute: The two men's homes. Roddis suffered mental health problems as a result of the intimidation . Mr Roddis said: 'We have been locking ourselves in, it has been very difficult. We couldn't even take out dog for a walk. 'He was at it all the time, we couldn't go out in the street. I have had to have psychiatric treatment. I was suicidal, it was that bad.' His angina has also worsened and he has been forced to step down as a magistrate in Barnsley because of the stress. The couple stopped friends from visiting their home and were so afraid of Barker they would not leave each other alone in the house. Mr Roddis said: 'I'm not surprised he has been sent to jail. The police told us to report everything so we did. Anyone else who is suffering this kind of behaviour should report everything, don't just give up. 'I've noticed a difference since he was jailed, it's been a lot quieter.' The couple refused to move because they liked their home and feared it would be difficult to sell because of the dispute. A 'for sale' sign has recently gone up outside Barker's property. When Barker was jailed for four months at Sheffield Magistrates Court he claimed the bail conditions before sentencing breached his human rights because he was banned from entering his own home. The empty house was burgled and he claimed to have suffered a £20,000 and damage. Members of his family refused to stand in court despite being asked twice when the district judge passed her sentence. Barker's solicitor was yesterday unable to comment.","Barrie Barker parked cars with plates reading 'R 5OUL' and 'GRA55 R'

Hundreds of foreign doctors working in the NHS are routinely failing key medical exams, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Success rates are so poor that medical associations want doctors to be allowed six attempts at passing the tests rather than the current four. The revelation raises fears the trainee medics, mainly from India, Pakistan and Nigeria, are not suitably qualified to treat patients despite spending three years working for the NHS before taking the exam. Hundreds of foreign doctors are routinely failing key medical exams raising fears about whether they are sufficiently qualified to be treating patients . Until they pass the exams, which qualify them to practise independently as hospital physicians or GPs, trainees continue to see patients – under supervision – in placements at hospitals and GP surgeries. Figures show that foreign doctors are substantially more likely to fail than UK graduates, with communication cited as one of the problems. While just nine per cent of British doctors fail to pass the knowledge and practical exams, more than  63 per cent of foreign doctors do not reach the standard to pass. Many take the exams up to the current maximum of four times and there is no way for patients to check how many times their GP failed before becoming fully qualified. Foreign medical associations are now demanding that doctors are given two additional opportunities to pass the tests amid claims that examiners may be discriminating against non-UK graduates. Shadow Health minister Andrew Gwynne said any attempt to make it easier for doctors to pass exams 'must be resisted' The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) said it had not ruled out taking legal action against the British medical colleges which set the exams. But their claims have been refuted by leading UK specialists who say a recent study showed ‘no substantial effects of gender or ethnicity on examiner/candidate interactions’, and that passing the exams is dependent on having the appropriate skills. Joyce Robins, co-director of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘This is scandalous. If a doctor can go on failing they shouldn’t be treating patients in the NHS and that should be stopped. ‘There has to be a cut-off point and four attempts is too many.’ Shadow Health Minister Andrew Gwynne said: ‘Any attempt to make it easier for doctors to pass these tough exams must be resisted.’ The row centres on foreign doctors who are training to become GPs – but a similar difference in pass rates has been observed among doctors hoping to become hospital physicians and psychiatrists. About 3,000 doctors a year take their final professional GP exams, set by the Royal College of GPs. Of those, approximately a third are from outside Europe and did not complete their basic medical training in the UK. In these cases, they are permitted to apply for NHS training posts, involving three years working in placements. The difference in the failure rate between UK and non-UK doctors is particularly pronounced in a part of the exam observing candidates in a mock consulting room, faced with 13 actors posing as patients. The test examines their knowledge, ability to ask important questions and listen to patients’ needs.Figures show that 63 per cent of foreign doctors failed the test, with communication one of the main problems. Around 3,000 doctors a year take their final professional GP exams set by the Royal College of GPs . They revealed that 13 per cent of foreign candidates did ‘not use language and/or explanations that are relevant and understandable to the patient’, even though all have taken English tests before working in the NHS. Only 3.8 per cent of UK candidates demonstrated similar communication problems. Of the Indian doctors taking the test, 63 per cent failed at the first attempt. For those from Pakistan, there was a 62 per cent failure rate, while 68 per cent of Nigerian doctors failed at the first try. Foreign doctors were also more likely to fail in a three-hour knowledge test, which is marked anonymously and electronically, ruling out discrimination. Figures show 16 per cent of UK graduates failed this compared with 46 per cent of foreign doctors. Clare Gerada, president of the Royal College of GPs, wrote to 10,000 trainee GPs this week ‘to set the record straight’ on the examination. The letter said: ‘As in any exam, a pass cannot be guaranteed just because you have completed your training and paid to take the exam. This would be a great disservice to you, the College and, most importantly, to patients.’ Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of BAPIO, said the exam system was ‘faulty’. He added: ‘There is a very robust system of selection to get on to NHS training in the first place. Doctors are then only put forward for exams when trainers say they are ready and are happy with their clinical and communication skills. ‘We don’t want to compromise as far as patient safety or standards of the exam are concerned. But we are worried that the way one part of the exam is organised is wrong.’ Dr Sabyasachi Sarker, president  of the British International Doctors Association, said: ‘Four attempts is just too low – although we want to extend it to six for all doctors, not just those who are foreign.

When it comes to designing apps, the hope is usually that your program will not only be useful to people but that you might also be able make some money as a result of its creation. For Gentry Underwood, his wildest dreams were realised when his Mailbox app was sold to Dropbox for $100 million. The app wasn't even available to the public, only by joining a mailing list. The Mailbox app allows users to organise and clear their email inbox in a far more smartphone friendly way than previously available. Scroll down for video . Multi-Million-dollar idea: Developer Gentry Underwood has sold his Mailbox app, which allows touch screen technology users to access their emails in an easier format, to Dropbox for $100 million . As CEO and co-founder, Mr Underwood has been speaking about how he managed to make an app that was centered around a simple idea of making email easier to manage on mobile devices. He came up with the idea after realising that traditional email programs were failing to be updated to work to their full potential on new technology platforms such as mobile phones. His app works with the way people use their mobile phones rather than their laptops, making accessing their emails via their phones easier. He told Wired how he spotted a gap in the market: 'It’s very natural when a new platform comes along to expect behavior to work as it did in the old platform, which means, for a smartphone, take a desktop email client and jam it down into the mobile device, because that’s all you know. You don’t know how people’s behavior is going to be different; you’ve never seen it before. Well, turns out we use our mobile phones really differently than we use our laptops. It’s taken us a while to figure that out and understand it, and that creates a design opportunity for a different kind of tool. Fundamentally, Mailbox is not an email client so much as it in an inbox, oriented around delightful processing. $100m buyout: Mailbox was purchased by Dropbox, the company that allows users to share big files easily between themselves and others. Underwood calls it a 'logical' partnership . Another reason that tool hadn’t appeared is third-party mail apps are really hard to build well. They require a massive technical investment. Mail itself is this very old protocol that generally is very slow. To deliver mail quickly when you open your device, we actually took a lot of infrastructure that historically has lived directly on the mail client and we moved it into the cloud. When you set up a mailbox account, Mailbox begins checking your mail from the cloud, reformatting it, sending you push messages when there are new messages, and having this tiny little snapshot ready for you when you open up the phone that, as soon as you hit the network, we just hand it to you as quickly as possible. That allows us to create a fast experience even though we’re only accessing the radio for a brief amount of time. But it’s a massive technological challenge to pull that off. For every person using mailbox there needs to be a bit of dedicated infrastructure that’s acting like a mail client on behalf of the cloud. The gap was created by mobile devices themselves.' Mailbox is popular because it provided innovative new ways to organize and clear an inbox. Users of Mailbox can view their inbox and the latest email they've opened at the same time compared to other programs that only allow users to view one or the other at a time. They can also use four simple gestures to control their email rather than having to select options and go through sub-categories before they find what they need. To archive an item, all they have to do is quickly swipe the message to the left, and to 'snooze' the message to look at later, the user just performs a slow left swipe. A slow swipe to the right will delete the email while a fast right swipe will file it. It is currently only available to Gmail users but Mailbox plans to soon be available across other email providers. Mailbox App in action: Thew App allows users to view their inbox and read emails at the same time . He tells the online magazine about how creating the Mailbox app was so resource intensive that the buyout from Dropbox came at the right time.'we were about to outgrow our space in Palo Alto and were in the process of looking for a new one — and getting a lot of the basics of keeping a business up and running taken care of. We felt like we had stumbled into this really large market, this very big opportunity. We felt like we could raise money but we still would have the problem of scaling a good team, and obviously it’s not just engineering and design; there’s also customer service and all the details of actually building an office and growing a team and building a culture.' The marriage between Dropbox and Mailbox seemed like a logical step, Mr Underwood says. Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring your photos, documents and videos anywhere and share them easily. The Dropbox allows users to create a special folder on each of their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of which computer is used to view it. The founder of Dropbox, Drew Houston, came up with the idea after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive while he was a student at MIT. He created Dropbox to make his life easier and in much the safe way Gentry Underwood beleives Mailbox will also simplify the way email is used.'If you think about mail as attachments, there’s a relationship between those things, and there’s no good mobile mail client that let you attach things easily from Dropbox,'Mr Underwood also talks about the difficulty app designers face: how to create money from selling an app whilst keeping advertising to a minimum.'You can imagine Mailbox going to some company that monetizes through advertising, where over time we’re going to have to find ways to put more and more ads into Mailbox — things that might actually decrease the overall experience or invade a user’s privacy. Whereas here we just have to build a product that people really like and want to use so much that some of them are willing to pay for it. That’s a much easier design challenge. It’s something that we thought about quite a bit as we were trying to figure out where to take the company.'The Mailbox app has had people talking about the simplicity of the idea for many months now. One critic summed up the thoughts of many: '“How insane is it that this guy invented four email gestures — swipes, in iOS jargon — and sold his company for $100 million?; . Gentry Underwood understands the nature of the business and how, in so many ways, he has been extremely lucky. 'Without commenting on the specific numbers of the deal, I will say that this is a very unusual market and the potential impact of these devices, I think, is what’s driving it. Mobile is ripping the world wide open. The companies that respond to that stand to be quite relevant in the future, so that’s what creates these seemingly crazy numbers.'","Gentry Underwood says he designed Mailbox to 'make email easier'

David Cameron said ministers would ‘strain every sinew’ to do more for service personnel and their families. The Remembrance weekend initiative aims to end the scandal of veterans being left too poor to buy a home and unable to get on a social housing list. Soldiers such as these pictured yesterday during a Remembrance Service in Camp Bastion will go to the top of the queue for a council house or mortgage when they leave the Army . Their foreign postings mean they lack the connection with an area that town hall chiefs look for when allocating council homes. Ex-servicemen see this as discrimination and, for some, the situation becomes so acute they are reduced to sleeping on the streets. Housing minister Grant Shapps will issue new guidance to local authorities to put retiring servicemen automatically  into the highest priority category for a council house after  the homeless. He will call on them to ‘positively discriminate’ in favour of former soldiers, sailors and airmen where tough decisions have to be taken. Anyone leaving the forces will also go to the top of the list for help through the Government’s FirstBuy scheme, which helps the less well-off buy a house with small deposits. Under the plans, soldiers will get priority for the first year after they leave the services. Housing Minister Grant Shapps will call on local authorities to 'positively discriminate' in favour of former soldiers, sailors and airmen . Mr Shapps has negotiated a deal with credit agency Experian, which is used by mortgage firms, to register a Ministry of Defence PO Box for use by servicemen. That means they will be able to build up the credit rating needed to obtain home loans. The Government is investing an extra £16million this year in a fund for injured ex-servicemen to install disabled facilities in their homes. The total budget will rise to £185million. Mr Shapps said: ‘Our brave men and women in uniform aren’t looking for sympathy and handouts, but all too often their selfless sacrifice for this country can become a major blockade on the road to a home of their own. ‘That’s why house-hunting heroes on the look-out for their first home will be at the very front of the queue for new Government-funded schemes like FirstBuy. ‘Equally, years of loyal military service should not be rewarded with years of languishing on local waiting lists. 'Just as our brave troops answered their call of duty, councils will need to do the same, to ensure that heroes who want a home in their area will be at the top of local waiting lists.’ According to the housing charity Crisis, at its peak a quarter of the homeless population had spent time in the forces – though the  figure is now thought to be around 3 per cent. Commandos at a homecoming parade and Armistice service at Plymouth Hoe yesterday. No longer will veterans be left homeless . The average Army private earns a meagre £17,265 after completing initial training, leaving them too little to save up to buy a home . That means around 4,000 former servicemen are homeless and many of them suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The average Army private earns a meagre £17,265 after completing initial training, leaving them too little to save up to buy a home. The predicament is even worse for those who have families to provide for. Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve got to strain every sinew as a country to make sure we do right by our armed forces, for those who come home wounded, for those who serve and for their families. ‘The most important thing is to make sure that we’re looking after the family and we’re doing more as a society and a country to do more for the wounded.'","Housing Minister calls on local authorities to 'positively discriminate' in favour of ex-servicemen .

A 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur . has spoken about his life-threatening meeting with the Boston bombers after . they carjacked his Mercedes last Thursday evening. The incident occurred at almost . 11p.m. when the man, who has asked to only be identified by his American . nickname Danny, had just pulled his car to the curb on . Brighton Avenue, Boston. While Danny was texting, a man in dark . clothes approached his car and knocked on the window. Before the driver could . react the man had unlocked the door, climbed in and was brandishing a . silver handgun, according to the Boston Globe. Scroll down for video . On the run: A man thought to be 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev enters a gas station in Cambridge, Massachusetts, wearing a gray hoodie and carrying snacks on Thursday evening. He appears to be followed by her brother Tamerlan in a beige cap . Chilling: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now wearing a beige cap, captured on camera using an ATM card hours before a police shoot-out where his brother and accomplice died . The man, who would later be . identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, asked Danny if he had followed the news . about Monday’s Boston Marathon bombings. 'I did that,' said the man. 'And I just killed a policeman in Cambridge.' Danny says he . has been able to fill in important blanks between the . murder of MIT police officer Sean Collier, just before 10:30 p.m. on . April 18, and the Watertown shootout that ended just before 1 a.m. with . the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev and the serious wounding of his brother . Dzhokhar, 19. Danny has described a truly harrowing ordeal which included a bizarre mix of bursts of life-threatening violence and everyday conversation on mundane subjects such as girls, how much . payments on his Mercedes ML 350 were, the iPhone5 and whether anyone still . listens to CDs. At one point Tamerlan told Danny not to look at his face, to he said he would not remember his face. The bomb suspect replied: “It’s like white guys, they look at black guys and think all black guys look the same. And maybe you think all white guys look the same.' In another moment during the carjacking, the suspects were disappointed that Danny did not have any CDs in his car. They flipped through the radio avoiding news stations and later put on a CD of chating after they had made a stop. Escape: The two bombing suspects pulled up at the Shell gas station to use a stolen ATM card from their hostage Danny. He managed to escape to the Mobil gas station across the street and call for help (right) Trapped: With his head down and wearing a cap, the suspected terrorist withdraws money from the machine hours after a surveillance picture of him had been beamed around the world . To begin with Danny was driving his . car with Tamrlan in the passenger seat beside him, while Dzhokhar . following behind in a sedan. Later the brother’s moved all the gear into . Danny’s car and Tamrlan drove. The late-night drive lasted an hour and a half. At one stage during his ordeal, Danny . says a friend called him on his phone and he was told by Tamerlan that . he would be killed if he spoke to the person in Chinese. 'Death is so close to me,' said Danny, recalling his thinking at the time. ‘I don’t want to die.’ 'I have a lot of dreams that haven’t come true yet,' said the student from central China, who attended a graduate school at Northeastern University before joining a tech start-up company. After the shootout: Investigators take a look at the stolen car driven by the Boston Marathon bombing suspects after they exchanged gunfire on a residential street in Watertown . Danny had come to the US in 2009 for a master’s degree and graduated in January 2012, before returning to China to await a work visa. He had returned two months ago, however he chose to told Tamerlan that he was still a student and had been in the U.S. barely a year. He says the brothers had some difficulty understanding his English when he tried to tell them he was from China. ‘Oh, that’s why your English is not very good,’ said Tamerlan. ‘OK, you’re Chinese... I’m a Muslim.’ ‘Chinese are very friendly to Muslims!’ Danny said. ‘We are so friendly to Muslims.’ Danny also revealed that could hear the . brothers openly discussing driving to New York, although he couldn't . make out if they were planning another attack or just looking to escape. Fortunately for Danny there was a problem because his . car was almost out of gas and then a set of circumstances played out which afforded him . an opportunity to escape his captors. In search of petrol they stopped . at a Shell Station, but younger brother Dzhokhar was forced to go inside the . Shell Food Mart to pay for petrol. When older brother Tamerlan put his . gun in the door pocket to fiddle with a navigation device, Danny seized . his moment to escape. 'I was thinking I must do two things: unfasten my seatbelt and open the door and jump out as quick as I can. If I didn’t make it, he would kill me right out, he would kill me right away'. Deadly shootout: In a gun battle where over 200 shots were fired, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev was hit multiple times . He unbuckled his seat belt, opened . the door, then slammed it behind, and sprinted off at an angle that . would be a hard shot for any marksman. 'F***!' he heard Tamerlan say, but the man did not follow. Danny reached the safe haven of a Mobil . station across the street and sought cover in a supply room, while he shouted at the clerk to call 911. Authorities have said that Danny's quick-thing escape allowed police to swiftly track down the Mercedes, . abating a possible attack by the brothers on New York City and . precipitating a wild shootout in Watertown that killed Tamerlan and left a severely injured Dzhokhar hiding . in the neighborhood. After an hour of talking to police -- as the shootout and manhunt erupted in Watertown --Danny was brought to East Watertown for a 'drive-by lineup,' studying faces of detained suspects in the street from the safety of a cruiser. He did not recognize the suspects in the line-up. He spent the night talking to local and state police and the FBI before being dropped at home at 3p.m. the next afternoon. Danny said, when he was back in Cambridge, after questioning, 'I think, Tamerlan is dead, I feel good, obviously safer. But the younger brother -- I don’t know.' Danny had wondered if Dzhokhar had discovered his address and would come looking for him. But the police knew the wallet and registration were still in the bullet-riddled Mercedes, and that a wounded Dzhokhar could not have gone far. That night, Dzhokhar was caught, ending a . harrowing week across Greater Boston and in particular for Danny. Hunt: The events in the early morning hours of April 19 set a massive police search in place that resulted in the capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19 . Other plans: New information suggests that Tamerlan, right, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, may have been planning to attack New York next . Wounded: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen here moments after he was pulled from the boat where he was hiding, suffered a throat wound and a leg wound .","A Chinese internet entrepreneur has spoken about being held against his will by the Boston bombers .

Police admitted last night that they are being dragged into too many Twitter disputes as a row raged over the decision to arrest a youth who abused Olympic diving star Tom Daley. Officers swooped on the home of Reece Messer, 17, at 2.45am yesterday, hours after he told the sports star he had ‘let down’  his late father in Monday’s synchronised ten metre final. Messer also threatened to ‘drown’ the 18-year-old but backtracked and apologised when his messages provoked an online storm. Last night, as Dorset police handed the troubled teenager a formal harassment warning, police leaders claimed forces are being dragged into too many petty social media rows. Officers were asked to look at content 14,000 times on Facebook alone last year and Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers,  said forces do not have the resources to monitor the internet. He said: ‘There is legislation which concerns causing harassment, alarm or distress. But can we police the internet when someone upsets someone else? ‘I don’t think we have the resources to do that. We can’t have a free-for-all online but we cannot involve the police every time something unpleasant is said.’ But Stuart Hyde, chief constable of Cumbria and the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on social media, said: ‘Social media is increasingly part of police business and the law covers situations where you have comment that goes way beyond legitimate opinion. 'We don’t just deal with people who are famous. People have the right to freedom of speech but it has to be within the law.’ The episode is an embarrassment for Games bosses who dubbed the extravaganza the ‘social media Olympics’. Daley did not make a formal complaint  about the series of tweets. Reece Messer was arrested after a complaint from a member of the public. Held: The 17-year-old was arrested and later bailed after malicious tweets were sent to Olympic diver Tom Daley (pictured) He was on police bail last night, but he could still face up to six months in prison for offences under the Malicious Communications Act after officers said they were investigating the rest of his Twitter account. A harassment warning can  be issued under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It is not a criminal conviction but will appear on an enhanced criminal records check. Reece’s family protested that he is a drop-out who has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and ‘needs help  not punishment’. His father Norman Messer, 58, apologised to Daley. He said his son has a psychiatric problem and ‘badly needs help’ but has no incentive to sort out his life because of his lavish benefits. At his home in Boscombe, near Bournemouth, the carpet cleaner said: ‘I’m quite shocked. Reece badly needs help. I’m heartbroken this has happened to him. ‘I think the police should be involved, but he doesn’t know what he’s saying. He just doesn’t think about it. ‘We’ve had a long history with Reece. It all started when he was about eight years old, he was quite normal up to that point. ‘Then he started going to school, insulting the other children, saying things like “Your mum’s a prostitute” to the other little boys. After that there were other problems in school. ‘He’s just gone off the rails. He suffers from ADHD. But he won’t take his medication. ‘I just want to say sorry to Tom Daley and wish him every success in the future.’ Mr Messer explained that he and Reece’s mother split up when Reece was 12 months old, and she now lives in Stockport. The controversy began after Daley and partner Pete Waterfield, 31, came fourth in the synchronised ten metre platform dive. In a Twitter message, Reece  told the young diver whose father died of a brain tumour last year: ‘You let your dad down i hope you know that.’ Daley forwarded the abuse  from ‘Rileyy_69’ and commented to his 850,000 followers: ‘After  giving it my all . . . you get idiots sending me this.’ Shocking: Diving star Tom Daley reacts angrily after he was sent an abusive tweet following his disappointment at missing out on a medal this afternoon . Abuse: This shows the original Tweet which was sent to Tom Daley . Thousands of Twitter users rushed to support Daley and identified the abuser. This provoked a series of messages in which Reece apologised to the sports star but then threatened to ‘drown you’ and called him a ‘cocky t**t’. One message said: ‘@TomDaley1994 I’m sorry mate i just wanted you to win cause its the olympics I’m just annoyed we didn’t win I’m sorry tom accept my apology.’ He added: ‘please i don’t want to be hated I’m just sorry you didn’t win i was rooting for you pal to do britain all proud just so upset.’ It is understood that the threat of violence led police to arrest Reece at a bedsit in Weymouth. Meanwhile, a Welsh Premier League footballer has been suspended after an abusive message was sent to Daley. Port Talbot Town FC has confirmed its midfielder Daniel Thomas will be the subject of an internal investigation into a tweet sent to Team GB diver Daley. According to reports, a homophobic message was sent to Daley's Twitter page from the 10DanThomas10 account, which has since been deleted. Port Talbot FC officials stressed their player had been the victim of a 'misguided prank' after leaving his phone unattended - but confirmed 28-year-old Thomas had been suspended while they looked into the matter. A club spokesman said: 'Port Talbot Town Football Club can confirm Daniel Thomas has been suspended from all involvement with the club until we have carried out a full internal investigation. 'We were made aware to an offensive comment appearing on the Twitter feed of one of our players. 'Upon being informed of the matter, we immediately distanced ourselves from any offensive messages whilst investigating the matter further. 'Having spoken at length to the player in question, we believe he regrettably left his phone unattended and was the victim of a very misguided ""prank"".' The club said it and Thomas apologised 'unreservedly' and in no way condoned the views made in the tweet. The spokesman added: 'All footballers at Port Talbot Town will also be briefed on the appropriate use of social media and ensuring it is used securely and responsibly.' Inspiration: Daley's father Rob, left, died in May last year following a long battle with cancer and was a major driving force behind the teenager's success . Daley’s close friend and Team GB diving team-mate Tonia Couch, whom Daley watched compete yesterday, suggested the exchange of comments would swiftly be forgotten. She said: ‘Tom’s a strong boy. He can concentrate on what he needs to do and, at the end of the day, Twitter’s Twitter. You don’t need to look at it if you don’t want to.’ Asked what she made of the abuse, she added: ‘Not much really, neither has Tom. We’re just concentrating on the Olympics.’ Team GB gymnast Louis Smith said ignoring Twitter is probably the best policy for athletes trying to win an Olympic medal. He said: ‘There are just tweets that you do not want to see.  Some people are not bothered by negative tweets and they can go about their day, but if you are going to take it personally then do not do it.’","Officers asked to look at content 14,000 times on Facebook alone last year .

It may not be the most serious of life’s problems, but an incredibly irritating one nonetheless – getting a pop song ‘stuck’ in your head, playing over and over. And much like for a bout of the hiccups, there seem to be few cures for ‘stuck-song syndrome’. Even listening to other music can fail to expel the offending tune which, ironically, tends to be one we didn’t even like much in the first place. Now scientists believe the phenomenon, technically known as an ‘earworm’, could have a remedy after all. Two of Lady Gaga's hits Alejandro and Bad Romance are most likely to get stuck in your head . Beyonce is also guilty of making songs that get stuck in your head, particularly her hit Single Ladies . PUGH.jpg . They found that solving a simple verbal puzzles, such as anagrams, forces the annoying music out of our working memory. Researchers at Western Washington . University played catchy pop songs to volunteers and then gave them . puzzles to work on. They found these made the ‘earworms’ disappear – . with simple five-letter anagram puzzles, giving the best results. While Sudoku could help also stop annoying tunes getting stuck, the puzzles had little effect if they were too difficult. And any word games that were too tricky could also allow the irritating melodies back in, the experiments revealed. Dr Ira Hyman, a music psychologist . who conducted the study, said: ‘Verbal tasks like anagrams or reading a . good novel seem to be very good at keeping earworms out. However, he added, the key is to find . something that will give the right level of challenge, where there is . not much space left in the brain. ‘Something we can do automatically . like driving or walking means you are not using all of your cognitive . resource, so there is plenty of space left for that internal jukebox to . start playing. You need to find that bit in the middle.’ Doing a puzzle like sudoku can help get the song out of your head, as long as it isn't too difficult . The researchers also found the most . common earworms tend to be popular songs that are in the charts or are . particularly well known. They found Lady Gaga was the most common artist to get stuck, with Beyonce and The Beatles close behind. The most catchy songs were: Alejandro and Bad Romance by Lady Gaga; Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen; Single Ladies by Beyoncé; She Loves You and I Wanna Hold Your Hand by The Beatles; SOS by Rihanna; You Belong with Me by Taylor Swift and Waterloo by Abba .","Solving verbal puzzles can help force annoying songs from memory .

It was supposed to be a fun, if risqué, event attended by scantily-clad students with worthy charitable motives. But the Safer Sex Ball brought notoriety to the University of Exeter last night after footage of two revellers engaged in an intimate act was posted on the internet. In the explicit four-minute clip, a woman is seen standing with her male friend next to a pool table in a bar at the university. Provocative look: Students dress up - or down - for December's Safer Sex Ball at Exeter University (NOTE: None of the students pictured were involved in the leaked video) She is wearing a very short skirt while he is dressed in shorts, a cape and a headband. The unidentified couple embrace in a sustained clinch before they shed their clothes and appear to lose all inhibitions. The footage then shows them dashing off in opposite directions after a fellow guest almost catches them in the act. CCTV film of the incident was recorded on to a mobile phone and passed . among students at Exeter, one of the country’s leading universities. The steamy footage has since been distributed on the internet. Some 2,200 students attended the ball on December 12, which featured . burlesque dancers and raised £140,000 for various charities. Revellers were encouraged to wear skimpy and risqué outfits and given . free contraception at the event, which is supposed to promote safe sex . and is organised by the University Guild, Exeter’s student union. Cheaper tickets were priced at £60. The £80 VIP tickets entitled holders . to a place at one of eight tables with private booths, provided with . canapés and copious amounts of cocktails and other drinks. The annual event has been criticised in previous years for its highly sexual tone. Embarrassing: The University was also recently forced to closed down its Exeter Uni Confessions site where students submitted their most 'disgusting and hilarious confessions' At one ball, the theme was  ‘Sex Around the World’ and featured rooms . which depicted the Rio carnival, the Wild West, a Japanese geisha’s home . and a chill-out area. One student said at the time: ‘I think the message of safe sex is . communicated but everyone is so drunk no one really takes any notice.’ The Guild has come under fire at Exeter for the latest incident. Writing in the online edition of Exepose, the university’s independent . student newspaper, Kitty Howie said: ‘Absolutely no consideration was . given to the students in the video or the reputation of the university. ‘It’s unfortunate that the Guild are having to face the backlash for something related to the  Safer Sex Ball.’ A 20-year-old student added: ‘The whole ball is disgusting anyway. They . pretend it’s about safe sex and Aids to give them an excuse to wear . nothing and get off with each other.’ The 2012 ball had already . attracted censure, after some critics said its ‘tribal’ theme was dubbed . racist. Dozens of academics and university staff signed a petition protesting against the theme and calling for a public apology. Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said of the . ball: ‘It’s regrettable when a university has to go along this . particular path in the name of promoting safer sex.’ He added: ‘I think many parents whose children are at this university will be appalled.’ The Guild said it was concerned that the couple’s right to privacy had . been breached by  whoever has posted the explicit clip online. A Guild spokesman said: ‘Putting CCTV footage on the internet without permission could contravene the law. ‘That would namely be data protection laws and human rights legislation – the right to privacy. ‘Engaging in sexual activity in a public place could also constitute an offence, depending on the form of sexual activity. ‘The Guild is making sure the affected parties will be supported during this difficult time.’ Yesterday the university declined to comment. Extreme: The charity ball - for which former student Will Young was once on the organising committee - has been slammed as 'irresponsible' and 'decadent' The Guild said it was concerned that the couple’s right to privacy had . been breached by  whoever has posted the explicit clip online. A Guild spokesman said: ‘Putting CCTV footage on the internet without permission could contravene the law. ‘That would namely be data protection laws and human rights legislation – the right to privacy. ‘Engaging in sexual activity in a public place could also constitute an offence, depending on the form of sexual activity. ‘The Guild is making sure the affected parties will be supported during this difficult time.’ Yesterday the university declined to comment.","Students' Guild looking into the leak after the video was shared online .
