"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A tiny new species of animal dubbed the 'water bear' has been discovered living in Antarctica - and it's so tough it can survive in space. Scientists found the creature - a member of the tardigrade family - on a trip to Victoria Land some 3,500 miles (5,600km) south of Australia. A number of them, no bigger than half a millimetre, were lurking on mosses within a crater hollowed out by ancient glaciers. Scroll down for video . Not such a cuddly bear: Scientists found the creature - a member of the tardigrade family - on a trip to Victoria Land some 3,500 miles south of Australia . Tardigrades, or water bears, are water-dwelling micro-animals with eight legs. The tiny creatures are certainly strange-looking with their eight chubby legs, little claws and probing heads. These bears are less than 1mm long and are found in the sea, in fresh water and on land. Some experts have compared their shape with jelly babies or moles but tardigrades they should not be judged by their 'cute' appearance. They are virtually indestructible - they will not die even if they are boiled, frozen, squeezed under pressure or desiccated. In fact, they can be completely dried out for years - and then spring back to life as if nothing had happened. Members of the tardigrade family have been found in high mountains, hot deserts and the deep ocean - and now in Antarctica. Members of the tardigrade family have been found in high mountains, hot deserts and the deep ocean - but never in Antarctica. And they're so resilient to harsh environments they've even been exposed in space by astronauts - and remarkably survived the experience. The water bear is the only kind of creature known that can survive in the vacuum of space. The widespread and ancient microscopic animals, found in moss and lichen, feed on plant cells or small invertebrates. But they can survive the rigours of Antarctica because they have also been tested with extremes of cold, heat, pressure, dehydration, poison and radioactivity. Members of the tardigrade family (new species, pictured) have been found in high mountains, hot deserts and the deep ocean - but never in Antarctica. Their examination under an electron microscope revealed various unusual features - including its red-orange body colour and cushions behind its claws (pictured). There was also a distinctive pattern of hairs on its body - suggesting the scientists were dealing with a new species . Water bears can be completely dried out for years - and then spring back to life as if nothing had happened . Dr Sandra McInnes of the British . Antarctic Survey, who helped verify the find, said: 'Under the . microscope they are slow walkers but they look like bears walking. 'They have four pairs of legs but they can hold their back tow legs down and arch themselves up to reach things. 'The cone-shaped mouth has a little hole in the middle for food and it has two eyes which can sense light too. 'Their muscles help them manipulate their claws like a human hand being opened and drawn back in again and they look rather like an armadillo.

Water bears have been tested with extremes of cold, heat, pressure, dehydration, poison and radioactivity . 'But if you can imagine any environment, you will probably find a tardigrade there - they have an incredible resistance. 'They've been tested in space, under liquid nitrogen, put under pressure and had chemicals thrown over them but they're fine after being washed in water. 'Researchers even breed from the ones that were sent into space on European and American Agency missions.' Researchers led by Dr Roberto Guidetti from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy found the new creature while on a trip to Victoria Land. Their examination under an electron microscope revealed various unusual features - including its red-orange body colour and cushions behind its claws. There was also a distinctive pattern of hairs on its body - suggesting the scientists were dealing with a new species. Further studies are to be carried out to determine how these new features benefit the animal but it is the furthest south a member of this tardigrade genus has ever been found. It was already known to be present in large swathes of South America and Tasmania. Dr McInnes added: 'It doesn't seem to travel well so it's quite an unusual genus to find a new member of, particularly in Antarctica where there are relatively few good tardigrade habitats.'

"By . Ashley Collman . Arson: A Rhode Island grand jury indicted Corrine Latraverse (pictured) Wednesday on charges she purposely burned down her Woonsocket home . A Rhode Island mother of three allegedly burned down her house to spite her longtime boyfriend, one day after she caught him cheating. Corrine Latraverse, 30 was indicted on charges of first-degree arson in Providence court on Wednesday for the incident which injured two firefighters and killed a cat. A patrolling police officer was the first to report the fire that broke out in the Woonsocket house around 4pm on March 15. Officer Scott Breguet found Latraverse with her three children - ages two, nine and 12 - safely outside the home with their two dogs. Latraverse's hair was singed and she had burn marks on her jacket. The family was taken to Rhode Island Hospital and treated for smoke inhalation. Though it was a multi-family building, no one else was inside at the time of the fire. Witnesses told Officer Breguet that 'they overheard other neighbors talking about how Corrine had told people on the way out of the house that she had burned the house down with a can of gas' Another witness said the couple living in the apartment had been having 'domestic issues' and had bought the property to 'fix things' after they both cheated on each other. Latraverse allegedly got into a fight with her boyfriend of 15 years the day before the fire when she caught him talking on the phone with another woman. The two appeared to have reconciled though, when the unidentified boyfriend left for his job as a milk deliveryman the next day. Scroll down for video .

Her boyfriend was still at work when she doused the hallways with gasoline and set the home on fire. Strong winds spread the fire quickly and firefighters struggled to contain the blaze when they arrived at the scene. Two firefighters received minor injuries when they fell through a floor inside the home engulfed in flames. The house has since been razed.

"By . Ashley Collman . A New York man confessed to killing his 8-year-old son when cops saved him from an attempted suicide on Sunday. Officers responding to a 911 call around 10pm found 41-year-old Boujeke Kenmoe on the floor of his Flushing, Queens home bleeding from the wrists while his son lay unconscious on a bed. When paramedics arrived at the four-family building, Kenmoe told them he had strangled his son that morning. Scroll down for video .

Kenmoe is pictured above with an unidentified boy in a photo posted to Facebook . Kenmoe was found bleeding from the wrists while his son was lying unconscious on a bed. Above, investigators are seen entering the Flushing, Queens home Sunday night . The little boy was pronounced dead at the scene. His name is being withheld as authorities try to inform his family. Police went to the apartment following a 911 call from a woman who said the emotionally-disturbed man had taken pills and was trying to kill himself inside the apartment. She said she was worried about his child. At the home, police found a two-gallon bucket filled with blood in the bathroom, along with the child's bloody clothes. However, investigators believe the blood was from Kenmoe's self-inflicted wounds. The Medical Examiner will rule the boy's cause of death, but sources told WABC that it appears the son was strangled. A neighbor said Kenmoe often had loud fights with his wife. The boy's mother was not at the apartment when police arrived Sunday night.

It was not immediately clear who the 911 caller was. The boy's mother was not at the apartment when police arrived, and neighbors said the couple often had loud fights. Neighbor Abed Islam told the New York Post that Kenmoe's wife had left the home for a while, but had returned at some point in an attempt at reconciliation. 'They tried to patch things up but it was still stormy in terms of their relationship,' Mr Islam said. Kenmoe allegedly told Mr Islam that his wife 'had a plan to split the family apart so she could leave.' Neighbors say Kenmoe was an immigrant from Africa and that his wife works at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. One neighbor described him as 'a good guy' who is 'always ready to help people'.","Boujeke Kenmoe, 41, was arrested Sunday night after police found him in the middle of an attempted suicide at his Queens home .

"By . Ashley Collman . Gone: Five-year-old Nathan O'Brien went missing from his grandparents house sometime Sunday night or Monday morning . Parents of a missing Canadian boy issued an emotional plea to bring him home yesterday, after he disappeared earlier this week from a sleepover at his grandparents house. Nathan O'Brien, 5, was reported missing along with his grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes, 66 and 53, when mother Jennifer O'Brien found her parents' Calgary home empty Monday morning. The grandparents are not considered suspects in the case as investigators found evidence that all three left the home against their will. At the press conference on Wednesday, Nathan's father Rod O'Brien cried as he spoke about his beloved middle son. 'To whoever has Nathan, please find it in your heart to drop off our little angel Nathan, so he can be rescued and reunited with his brothers and his family,' Mr O'Brien said. Jennifer O'Brien also spoke, telling her son to have courage. 'Stay strong, Nathan. We know you are our superhero and I just need you to stay strong and we are going to see you.' 'We can't be with you right now, but the best people who can be with you other than us are your grandparents,' Mrs O'Brien said of her parents. 'I know Grandma is holding you so tight right now, and they are doing everything in their power to keep you safe.' Mrs O'Brien last saw her son Sunday night, after helping her parents all day with a garage sale as they were downsizing to move into a new Edmonton home. Emotional: The parents of Nathan O'Brien cry in a press conference about his disappearance on Wednesday. Mother Jennifer O'Brien on the left and father Rob O'Brien on the right . Not suspects: Alvin and Kathryn Liknes are not considered suspects in the case, since investigators found signs of a struggle in the home . Mrs O'Brien described her son as a chatterbox who loved superheros. Pictured above, Rod O'Brien (left), Jennifer O'Brien (second left), Maximus O'Brien (center), Nathan O'Brien (second right), Luke O'Brien . She left her parents home around 10pm and Nathan stayed behind to have a sleepover with his grandparents. When she returned 12 hours later in the morning, all three were gone. An Amber Alert was issued for Nathan later that evening, but investigators so far have not named a suspect. Investigators have not said much about what they found in the home, but there is visible an 8-meter-long drag mark of what looks to be recently cleaned up dark liquid that runs from the home's side door to the driveway. 'We have a big mystery on our hands right now, we don’t know where these people are,' said Inspector Keith Cain. 'We’re still very optimistic they are alive.' Where did they go? Mom Jennifer O'Brien was the last to see Nathan after she left him at her parents house Sunday night . Mrs O'Brien and her son spent the day prior helping her parents with a garage sale at their home . Investigators are now asking those who attended the garage sale on Sunday to attend a meeting at the Parkhill Community Hall today. Officers want the shoppers to bring with them their purchases so they can figure out what was or wasn't taken from the home. The meeting is running from 10am to 10pm. Before the press conference on Wednesday, the family considered announcing a reward but decided against it since police said it might not be helpful right now. Authorities say there was no custody issues with the family since Nathan is the O'Brien's biological son and they are still married. Nathan is described as three-feet tall with curly blond hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing peach-colored shorts and a blue-striped hoodie. Alvin Liknes is six-feet tall, 200 pounds with grey and blond hair and was wearing black shorts. Authorities say he has a distinctive walk. His wife Kathryn is five-foot-three, 120 pounds and has reddish-brown hair with green eyes. Since the three family members were reported missing, authorities have received over 100 tips.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . The Indiana mother who - along with her boyfriend - overdosed on heroin in a McDonald's play area they were at with their children was sentenced Monday to six months behind bars. Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, and boyfriend Robert Palmer, 37, was were arrested march after the fire department in Green Township responded to a call about two unresponsive adults. Jeffers was sentenced to six months in jail, with 90 days suspended and given credit for 44 days served only one week after Palmer received a similar punishment, according to WXIX. Jailed: Tamica Jeffers, 33, stands Monday in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court with her attorney John Waggal, left, as she is sentenced to six months in jail . Robert Paul Palmer, 37, and Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, of Dillsboro, Indiana were arrested last month after shooting up at an Ohio McDonald's. Both have been sentenced to 6 months in jail . Authorities said Jeffers was unconscious and not breathing, and Palmer was conscious but unresponsive. They eventually recovered from what police say were 'life-threatening overdoses' of heroin. Authorities say the couple admitted taking the drugs while with a five-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy they had brought to the play area. Attorney Michael J. Trapp said Palmer hopes to serve his time and then begin picking up the pieces of his life. 'My client is very sorry that this happened,' Trapp said after the sentencing. Prosecutors said in court he showed little appreciation for the seriousness of his actions. He will get credit for time served since his arrest, meaning he has a little less than five months left in jail, but it is not known if he had the last half of his sentence suspended similar to Jeffers'. Multiple MailOnline attempts to reach local authorities for clarification were not successful. After the overdoses, the McDonald's franchise owner and operator in suburban Green Township said he was proud that the restaurant crew and its customers took quick action to respond to the emergency and call 911 for medical help for the couple. The couple's children were in the playground at this McDonald's in Ohio when their parents overdosed on heroin .","Robert Paul Palmer, 37, and girlfriend Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, were arrested last month while high at an Ohio McDonald's .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Rosemarie Lentini . Mexican officials have denied one of their helicopters flew into Arizona on Thursday, and blamed the gunfire on the drug smugglers they were tracking. The U.S. had claimed earlier this week that the Mexican helicopter had crossed into Tucson and fired at two agents before going back across the border. A border patrol spokesman said on Friday that Mexico had called to apologize for the incident, but the country's attorney-general's office has now changed tact. Dispute: Mexico is denying claims that one of its helicopters, not pictured, crossed the U.S. border and fired near government agents on Thursday . A Mexican official disputed claims that the helicopter strayed into U.S. airspace, and said the crew were at least 100m away. Tomas Zeron, director of the Mexican attorney general's investigative office, told CNN they were involved in an investigation 'on the border'. 'I do not think we crossed the border because we brought our navigation. But it was just 100 meters from the border.' He blamed criminals for the shooting and said several were arrested after the incident, which came during an investigation into drug smuggling and people trafficking. Zeron also gave no indication that an apology for the shooting was needed, and said Mexican authorities had done nothing wrong. Vivian McLoughlin, of the U.S. Border Patrol, had confirmed on Friday that the Mexican helicopter crossed the border at 5.45am on Thursday. No further details were given by the border agency, but a spokesman said it was being investigated. KVOA-TV reported the chopper fired over Tohono O’odham Indian Nation in the Arizona desert, before flying back to Mexico. The agents were not injured. Location: Authorities said the Mexican military helicopter fired two shots over Tohono O'odham Indian Nation in the Arizona desert near the border, before flying back to Mexico early Thursday morning . This was not the first time the Mexican military has veered across the international boundary. In January, US border agents confronted two heavily armed Mexican soldiers who crossed 50 yards inside Arizona, the Los Angeles Times reported. A standoff ensued, but nobody was hurt. In 2011, more than 30 uniformed Mexican soldiers in military vehicles crossed the Rio Grande without authorization in an incident that was believed to be inadvertent. According to a recent Washington Times story, the US Department of Homeland Security says that Mexican police or troops have crossed over the border around 300 times during the last decade, and were armed in around half of those incidents.","The Mexican chopper was involved in an anti-drug smuggling operation .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . 'Cruel': Lauren Bush, 17, allegedly taunted an autistic boy and filmed it on her cell phone . An autistic boy who allegedly endured months of abuse at the hands of two girls he called his friends said he wants the charges against them dropped. Lauren Bush, 17, and another girl, 15, allegedly kicked the 16-year-old boy - a fellow classmate at Chopticon High School in Morganza, Maryland - in the groin, held a knife to his throat and tried to get him to have sex with his family's dog, all while they recorded him on their cell phones. They also forced the boy to walk on a frozen lake, causing him to fall into freezing water several times while they did nothing to help, and on another occasion, they shaved off his eyebrows, according to records. Still, the boy - who has only been identified by his middle name, Michael - considers Bush and the 15-year-old girl, who was his girlfriend, to be his friends. 'It really makes me upset that my parents want to see them in jail,' he told the Washington Post. 'Because I really like them.' He said the girls never intended to kill him - even when they held a knife to his neck and led him to a frozen lake and persuaded him to fetch a basketball on the ice. Minutes later, he fell through the ice and screamed, but the girls did nothing to help, he said. Afterwards, they wouldn't allow him to ride with them and he returned home wet. 'They put me in the trunk,' he said. 'They didn't want to get the interior wet.' His parents, however, said they want Bush to be tried as an adult. Scroll down for video . Scene: Bush, her fellow defendant and their victim are students at Chopticon High School in Morganza, Maryland. The cruelty only stopped when a fellow student heard about the videos and told officials . 'My son is a staunch defender of his . tormentors; it’s embarrassing,' his father told the Post. 'He may be more disabled than I . convinced myself that he was and maybe more lost than I realized. That's . something I am going to have to deal with on a later day. Right now, I . am trying to get justice for him and others like him.' He added: 'Many of the attacks occurred . at our home. If they hadn't been caught, I think they would have killed . him or all of us.' Michael told the Post he started going . out with the younger girl last year after wooing her with notes, and . that both of the girls knew he was autistic. He tried to cover up the treatment, but his parents knew something was wrong when money started vanishing from his account, and it turned out he was taking the girls out every weekend. The concerned parents called the school when their son returned home without any eyebrows - but officials said students weren't bullying him for the look - and eventually banned the boy from going out with the girls when his bank balance continued to dwindle. Then on March 10, . sheriff's deputies confiscated the younger girl's phone and both were arrested. Their cruel treatment was uncovered after a fellow student heard about the videos and told school authorities. Bush, 17, was charged as an adult with first-degree assault, false . imprisonment and child-pornography solicitation, and faces up to 80 . years in prison if convicted. She has been on house arrest, but on Monday she reported to state juvenile detention center for several . weeks of psychological evaluation, the Post reported. The . Bushes hope the tests prove she should be tried as a juvenile, not an adult. Donna and Larry Bush claim the boy is far smarter than the girls and that they never intended to seriously harm him. They insist their daughter is remorseful. The 15-year-old was charged as a juvenile and earlier this month, she pleaded . guilty to second-degree assault and displaying an . obscene photograph. She remains in a juvenile detention center. Sheriff Tim Cameron told ABC7 that the allegations leveled against the girls are among the most disturbing he has dealt with in his career. Police say the girls have admitted to videotaping the incidents, but officials are still trying to figure out why. 'Who . could harbor this ill will to do something so completely heinous?' said .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Donald Sterling will not be able to buy his way out of his racism scandal as a handful of charities have publicly declared that they will no longer be accepting money from the LA Clippers owner. UCLA has even decided to reject a $3million gift that he gave to support the school's kidney research program. The $3million pledge was spread over years, so the school has only received the $425,000 initial payment- which it will return- and the rest was due to come in installments- which have now been cancelled. Scroll down for video . Rejected: Donald Sterling, who was issued a lifetime ban from the NBA, has had his charitable donations returned . 'Mr. Sterling’s divisive and hurtful comments demonstrate that he does not share UCLA’s core values as a public university that fosters diversity, inclusion and respect,' University spokesman Phil Hampton said in a statement according to CBS Los Angeles. The gift was specifically earmarked for the work being done by Dr Ira Kurtz, who was trying to learn about the structural properties of key proteins in the kidney which could lead to development of targeted drugs. UCLA had by far the biggest gift to give back, but other area charities are now facing the decision of what to do with their donations. TMZ reported that the Goodwill of Southern California was promised a $100,000 gift over ten years, and decided to return the $20,000 it had already received and stop the future payments. Cause above all: The Union Rescue Mission is keeping their annual $10,000 donations from Sterling, saying 'We take money from all kinds of bad people all the time' Cutting it off: A Place Called Home, which runs homeless shelters for high risk teens, was $30,000 into a planned $100,000 gift and they announced that they will keep the money they have received but reject the future payments . A Place Called Home, which runs homeless shelters for high risk teens, had a similar payment plan set up and have already received $30,000 from the embattled billionaire. They decided to keep the money they have already received but reject the $70,000 that is scheduled to come. Others have decided that their causes need the money more than the symbolism of returning the funds. That is true for the Temple of the . Arts which is keeping $10,000 and the L.A. Union Rescue Mission which . has been receiving $10,000 from Sterling for an unspecified number of . years. 'We take money from all kinds of bad people all the time,' a spokesman told TMZ. The American Diabetes Association had a . similar, though more diplomatic, explanation for why they have decided . to keep the $25,000 that he has donated. 'The sad reality is that without donations like Mr. Sterling's, we can't help the people that we do,' a spokesman said. Not afraid to stand out: Sterling's girlfriend V.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A South African couple rowed into the record books on Friday after becoming the first team to cross the Atlantic from Africa to the U.S. It took Riaan Manser and his girlfriend Vasti Geldenhuys 153-days to make the journey in their custom-built 23ft row boat. The couple celebrated their accomplishment with a kiss as they passed the Statue of Liberty, after enduring a 6,500-mile journey with no support crew and limited supplies. Scroll down for video . 'We made it': Riaan Manser kisses his girlfriend Vasti Geldenhuys as they arrive in New York after rowing across the Atlantic . Record: The South African couple became the first crew to ever row cross the Atlantic from mainland Africa to mainland North America . Manser and Geldenhuys, who started their journey on December 30, estimate that it took 3.6 million rows for them to make it to New York City. They carried only essentials on board, and kept themselves fed and watered by fishing and using a salt-water convertor. A GPS system helped them - and their friends and family - keep track of their progress as they crossed the Atlantic, and made their way up from the Bahamas and Miami, to New York. When they reached Manhattan the couple became the first crew to have rowed from mainland Africa to the mainland of North America. 'Making history in the 21st century? Where do you do that,' Manser said, adding that their crossing was the . 'biggest romantic story to be told.' 'Done! Emotional all round!' the couple posted to their Facebook page Friday afternoon, after mooring in Manhattan. Nearly there: The couple make their way towards Manhattan as they complete their 6,500-mile journey . Close quarters: The couple made the journey in a 23ft rowboat, and had no back up crew and few amenities . Adventure: The couple had hoped for calm seas but at times their 23ft boat was faced with challenging conditions . Manser, 40, said they had expected the . crossing to be smoother, but their boat was tossed about on rough seas . and at one point capsized. 'We were naïve. We thought the Atlantic . would be this calm little pond that you just row across,' he told the New York Post. 'By the fifth day, we were . saying to each other, what is going on? Goodness gracious. It should be a . lot calmer. The sea was very, very, very angry.' In February a huge swell knocked Manser from the boat, the Spirit of Madiba, which capsized with Geldenhuys still on board. Fortunately, when it righted itself, she was still in her seat and, although they lost everything on deck, both escaped without injury. On another occasion, Geldenhuys had to rescue her boyfriend of 15 years using their fishing line, after he fell from the boat while trying to take a photo. Awe-inspiring: Manser holds up a flying fish he caught while crossing the Atlantic . Ready to go: Manser used Twitter to log their journey, which they began on December 30 . 'I couldn’t turn the boat around and I couldn’t stop the boat. But what saved him was the fishing line. He grabbed onto the fishing line that was behind the boat and I reeled him in,' she told CBS. The couple also had to flag down a large ship for help when their salt-water convertor broke, leaving them with no fresh water supplies. Manser documented their journey on Twitter, opening the account of their adventure on December 30 with the tweet: 'It's all go for Atlantic Ocean rowing Monday 9am. 90% done.100% impossible I think. I've never been this prepped in last 12 years of journeys.' The couple described their boat capsizing in February as a wake up call, but said despite the danger, the journey was worth it. 'You . get this quiet time, and the sun is setting, and there's like pink and . blue and white fluffy clouds, and it's just so quiet,' Geldenhuys said. First leg: Vasti points to Lanzarote as the couple pass the Canary Islands in January . Catch of the day: The couple supplemented their freeze-dried food supplies with freshly caught fish . Explorers: The couple, who have been together for 15 years, took 153 days to cross the Atlantic . Endurance and adventures are nothing new to the 40-year-old who in 2006 became the first person to cycle the perimeter of Africa. It took him two years to make his way through 35 countries, and his achievement was acknowledged by Nelson Mandela who described Manser as 'a performance that will inspire the youth of the continent'. Although most of the couple's latest adventure was spent at sea, they stopped off for a welcome break in the Bahamas in April and arrived in Florida just in time to watch a Miami Heat game. The stops on dry land gave the couple a break from their rigorous eight-hour-a-day rowing schedule, as well as from their limited food supply. Welcome break: The couple broke up their journey with a stop in the Bahamas . Achievement: The couple congratulate each other after reaching New York City . Arrivals: Manser and Geldenhuys row past the Statue of Liberty on Friday afternoon . They had packed freeze dried food, but supplemented that with whatever fish they could catch, meaning that on some days they had the freshest food available, as they feasted on huge sea bass that had been hooked out the Atlantic just moments earlier. After reaching their destination yesterday, the couple seemed keen to take a break from the sea, and posted a fun message on Twitter offering to sell their boat. 'We have finished rowing our boat from Africa to NYC. @TM2NY Anyone keen to buy&use her to get to UK?

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Louisiana man who spent 17 years in prison for attempted rape has been released after DNA proved he was innocent. The night Nathan Brown was arrested in 1997 over claims he tried to attack a woman who lived in his apartment complex, he was a father to two young girls. Seventeen years later, and his eldest daughter has a baby of her own, who Brown was able to hug for the first time on Wednesday after being released from prison. Free man: Nathan Brown greets his daughter Celene Brady and grandson Kenard after being released from prison on Wednesday . Relief: Brown hugs his daughter Celene on Wednesday. He served 17 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of trying to rape a woman who lived in his building . 'It's really a relief mentally, . physically, to be free from serving time for a crime that you did not . commit,' Brown said as he held his one-year-old . grandson, Kenard, for the first time. 'It was hard. It wasn't no easy task being in prison for 17 years for something you had no knowledge of,' the father-of-two told the Times-Picayuna. The only evidence linking Brown to the crime scene was the victim identifying him after police presented him as the sole suspect. But, after public policy group Innocence Project requested that DNA taken from the victim's dress be tested, it finally proved police had arrested the wrong man. A match was made from a saliva sample taken from the dress, which linked the DNA to a man who is currently serving a sentence in Mississippi. The suspect, who has not yet been named, is believed to have lived just a few blocks from where the attack in 1997 took place. Accused: Booking photos taken of Brown in 1997. DNA evidence last year finally proved another man had been responsible for the attack . Campaign: The Innocence Project helped Brown, second left, to prove his innocence . Lost years: After securing his release, the Innocence Project will now help Brown apply for compensation . Brown said he hopes that the victim will 'find comfort in knowing that the guy that really committed this crime will be brought to justice'. He added that he did not resent the victim. 'She was attacked. It was a terrible thing that happened to her.' The woman had been walking through the courtyard of the apartment building in 1997 when she was knocked to the ground from behind. Her attacker bit the woman on the neck, ripped her dress and stole her purse before fleeing. She told police she had seen him leave the crime scene on a bike, but when officers arrived the building's supervisor directed them to Brown's apartment. His family were one of the few African-Americans living in the building and, despite at least four family members telling police he had not left the apartment, Brown was arrested. Family: Brown hugs his cousin Shawn Brown after finally being released from prison . Catching up: Brown's grandson Kenard hides behind his mom's leg in a moment of shyness when he meets his grandfather . When police knocked on his door Brown was in his pajamas and was rocking his baby to sleep. Despite the victim claiming her attacker had strong body odor, Brown reportedly smelled of soap when she was asked to identify him. Brown was sentenced to 25 years in prison, but continually protested his innocence before finally reaching out to the Innocence Project for help last April. 'What happened to Nate Brown is absolutely horrific,' Vanessa Potkin, senior attorney for the Innocence Project, said. 'A lot went wrong in this case. A crime happened, and there was a rush to judgment. No one stopped and scrutinized on any side. People just didn't hear his screams that he was innocent,' she told the Times-Picayuna. The group was able to push for the DNA analysis that finally proved Brown's innocence, and is now helping the 40-year-old seek compensation for his wrongful imprisonment.","Nathan Brown was sentenced to 25 years after being wrongly convicted .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Google's Kevin Rose has built a career out of cutting-edge technology but plans to bring his historic Oregon home into the 21st Century have not been welcomed. Rose, who founded news site Digg before joining Google, paid $1.3 million for the spacious 1890s house in Portland. But when he revealed plans to demolish the five-bedroom house and build a new one on the site, neighbors started a petition to try to save the property. Digg founder Kevin Rose has decided not to go ahead with plans to bulldoze his historic Oregon home after his neighbors' protest sparked a last-minute change of heart . Rose, who founded the news site Digg before joining Google, paid $1.3 million for the spacious 1890s house in Portland . The house, which was built in 1892, has been described as one of the 'great icons of Northwest Portland'. On Monday however, a permit was issued to tear the property down after Rose had it removed from an historic homes inventory. Steve Wilson, who was one of the agents who listed the property, said he knew Rose and his wife Darya planned a remodel, but said he was shocked to hear it was going to be pulled down. 'We did expect him to do a substantial remodel, but you pay $1.3 million and tear a house down? In Portland? That doesn't happen in,' he told the Oregonian. An online petition set up by the couple's new neighbors has attracted more than 1,100 signatures since being set live. In an open letter addressed to Rose and his wife, the petition states: 'When several of us met you at this year’s Easter egg hunt, we were eager to find out about your plans. But when he revealed plans to demolish the five-bedroom house and build a new one on the site, neighbors started a petition to try to save the property . Updates: Rose and his wife had planned to remodel the five-bedroom house . Extra work: The couple then put in plans to demolish the family home because of concern over asbestos . 'We were reassured that you had no plans to build on the spare lot, and were relieved to hear that you were committed to remodeling rather than demolishing the house.' It added that the neighbors had been shocked to later hear that the property had been removed from Portland's landmark inventory and was set to be demolished. Rose has responded to the petition, releasing a statement that claimed the couple had been left no choice after receiving a quote for remodeling that was more than the house price. Despite having surveys done before agreeing to buy the house, the couple later discovered extensive repairs were needed. Rose said that they have asked the previous owner to buy back the house and fix the asbestos and other issues with it, and said if the demolition went ahead the materials would be recycled. Campaign: Google entrepreneur Kevin Rose's new neighbors have started a petition to try to save the house . Unlisted: Kevin Rose had the house removed from a list of potentially significant properties . 'We never intended to deceive anyone, as some of you have accused. We simply wanted to create a beautiful home for our family,' Rose said. He added that the house had been listed as potentially significant on a voluntary register, but when an independent architect inspected it, they assured the couple it was not historically important. Rose said the couple had hoped to just carry out an extensive remodel but 'the costs were higher than we anticipated, and we knew we could never recoup that kind of money on a 100 year-old house'. Jim Draudt and Ann Witsil, who the Roses bought the house from, have also backed the petition to save the property, issuing a statement praising neighbors for raising concerns about the demolition. 'The only solution acceptable to us is to save the house, not to remove it,' the couple wrote.","Rose removed 1892 house from historic register to get demolition permit .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The son of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno has launched an attempt to clear his father's once-respected name shortly after he filed a lawsuit against the university protesting his own dismissal from the school. Former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno told his son the day after his firing that he hadn't informed the coaching staff about allegations Jerry Sandusky may be a child molester because he was unsure whether they were true, Jay Paterno writes in a new book. In Paterno Legacy: Enduring Lessons from the Life and Death of My Father, which hit the shelves at some central Pennsylvania bookstores this week, Jay Paterno writes that his father said he didn't want to accuse somebody of something he didn't witness or know to be true. Defense: Jay Paterno (left) is the author of the book, Paterno Legacy: Enduring Lessons from the Life and Death of My Father.  Joe Paterno (right) told his son the day after his firing that he hadn't informed the coaching staff about allegations Jerry Sandusky may be a child molester because he was unsure whether they were true . 'I didn't know that he'd done all that . stuff,' Joe Paterno told his son, according to the book. 'I had no idea. I just didn't know.' The book takes a defensive tone toward the elder Paterno, who lost his job shortly after Sandusky's arrest in November 2011 and died of lung cancer just months later. Jay Paterno, who abandoned a candidacy for lieutenant governor before this year's Democratic primary after his nominating petitions were challenged, is involved in two lawsuits in which Penn State is the defendant. 'I am not writing to exonerate my father because he did not commit a crime that needs a pardon,' he wrote. 'If anything, he is guilty of failing to possess the God-like qualities ascribed to him by others, qualities that Joe was the first to insist he never had.' Son's story: This book cover image released by Triumph Books shows Paterno Legacy: Enduring Lessons from the Life and Death of My Father, by Jay Paterno . His take on the Sandusky scandal closely follows - and repeatedly cites - a rebuttal his family produced after a report commissioned by the university concluded that Joe Paterno helped conceal Sandusky's behavior to avoid bad publicity. Long sections of the book describe Jay Paterno's upbringing and his 17 years as an offensive assistant coach under his father, who built the program into a powerhouse and was instrumental in the university's growth and expansion. Joe Paterno's firing, and a subsequent decision to remove his statue from outside the football stadium, remains controversial among Penn State alumni and fans, and Jay Paterno describes the trustees in bitter terms, saying they were just trying to save themselves. 'The firing was an act of cowardice,' he wrote. 'End of story.' In a phone interview Friday with The Associated Press, Jay Paterno said his father first realized Sandusky may be a child molester in late 2010, when he got word that a grand jury was investigating, long after Sandusky's retirement. Paterno had fielded a complaint about Sandusky in a shower with a boy nearly a decade earlier and told the school's athletic director about it. Police weren't notified, however, and the report languished until a fresh complaint in 2008 caused police to investigate Sandusky. For Jay Paterno, the realization about Sandusky came within a few days of his father's testimony before the grand jury in January 2011. Until then, he said, he had thought of Sandusky as someone who was doing a lot of good for people - Sandusky had established a charity for at-risk children in the 1970s, and prosecutors later determined he used it to find and groom victims. 'When you know somebody for so long, it's awfully hard to believe bad things about someone, when every sign in his life points the other way,' he said. Close working relatonship: Joe Paterno and Jerry Sandusky (pictured in 2013) worked together for years, but Jay Paterno says his father did not know that allegations of child molestation were true . Three . former Penn State administrators are awaiting trial on charges they . participated in a criminal cover-up of allegations against Sandusky: . former university president Graham Spanier, former athletic director Tim . Curley and former vice president Gary Schultz. They have denied the . accusations. 'I . know what kind of men I think they are, based on personal interactions . with them,' Jay Paterno told the AP. 'I've had nothing but good . experiences with those people and nothing but honest dealings with . them.' Sad end: Joe Paterno had coached at Penn State since 1950 before he was fired in 2011 for allegedly concealing Sandusky's child molestation. He died just months later . Battle continues: Jay Paterno is currently suing Penn State for his own dismissal from the college's football staff . The Paterno family is behind a lawsuit against the NCAA over the organization's punishment of Penn State, including a $60 million fine, a four-year ban on postseason play and a temporary loss of football scholarships. Jay Paterno and another former assistant, Bill Kenney, filed a federal lawsuit this week seeking more than $1 million for their dismissal from the team when a new coach was hired in early 2012. They say they have been unfairly linked to the Sandusky scandal. Asked what Joe Paterno would think about his family suing the university, Jay Paterno said: 'I can't speak for him, but I can tell you this - one of the things my father believed in was truth and integrity.' Sandusky, who spent decades as Joe Paterno's lead defensive assistant, was convicted two years ago of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving a lengthy prison sentence.","Jay Paterno has written a new book defending his father Joe Paterno .

"By . Simon Boyle . and Caroline Graham . With a bitter legal row escalating and his carefully crafted public image hanging by a thread, X Factor boss Simon Cowell insists he is ‘smitten and very much in love’ with the New York socialite carrying  his child and has vowed: ‘I’ll do the right thing.’ The rattled reality TV star faced a barrage of abuse this week from close friend Andrew Silverman, who accused him of shattering a perfect family by fathering a child with his glamorous wife Lauren. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Cowell, 53, has promised to support his lover ‘emotionally and financially’ and insists he is committed to forging a long-term relationship with the brunette. United: Cowell and Lauren pictured last August on holiday together . It is understood his support will include bankrolling her costs after her estranged husband launched a divorce case against her in which he labelled her ‘inhuman’. A close friend of Cowell’s, speaking with his permission, has told how the star has promised to stand by Mrs Silverman, who is said to be desperate for marriage. The confidante said: ‘Simon and Lauren are smitten with each other – they’re looking forward to the baby. They started as friends, but their friendship became stronger and they fell in love. 'I have never seen Simon so excited by something that isn’t related to his work. Becoming a father seems to have put things in perspective for him.’ Simon Cowell with, from left, Mrs Silverman and friends Sinitta and Rachel Roy . But the star faces accusations that his . apparent transformation to family man is a cynical stunt to protect his . image in America. After the news of the pregnancy broke, it was suggested that Cowell would merely look after the baby financially and put a roof over Mrs Silverman’s head. The sudden turnaround from this stance to saying he will play an active role as a parent comes amid fears the scandal could destroy his popularity, particularly in America where he is the face of family television. He launched a third series of the X Factor USA for Fox TV last week. His senior advisers fear the scandal could be damaging in America’s conservative and religious heartland. Insiders claim Fox executives will be watching the saga unfold ‘very closely’ fearing potential damage to their brand. Pepsi, which sponsors the X Factor, could also argue he has brought its brand into disrepute. Cowell’s deals with Fox TV have made him the highest-earning personality on U.S. television. He makes approximately £60 million a year from The X Factor in salary and intellectual property rights, according to business magazine Forbes. One source said: ‘You have got to be aware that the only thing that matters to Simon is Simon’s reputation. Simon Cowell and Lauren Silverman get close on Cowell's yacht in front of her husband Andrew . ‘Yes, he wants to do the right thing. Yes, he wants to earn money. Yes, he wants to honour his commitments. But ultimately he wants to protect his reputation – and mostly his reputation in the US.’ Ever since Mrs Silverman told her husband about the baby, on July 10, a vicious propaganda war has been played out behind the scenes. However, last night a close friend of the new couple, New York fashion designer Rachel Roy, insisted the romance was real. Ms Roy, who joined them on the Slipstream super-yacht where they first met, said: ‘What I know for sure is that when they are together they are the happiest I have ever seen them.’ Andrew Silverman spotted arriving back at his house in New York following the news that his wife is expecting Simon Cowell's baby . Rachel, who took the now infamous photograph of Cowell and Mrs Silverman cuddling on board the boat, added: ‘This is not a case of opposites attract. Simon and Lauren are similar in so many ways, they have many shared interests and values. They laugh at the same things, love the same foods, music and simply enjoy each other’s company in a way that best friends do.’ Cowell’s close friend added: ‘He’s  told Lauren and her family that he will do everything he can to support them all while she and Andrew work out their divorce matters. Simon respects what she thinks.’ The Mail on Sunday understands the X Factor star is planning a yacht getaway with Mrs Silverman after completing his latest TV commitments. Mr and Mrs Silverman had a £2 million pre-nuptial agreement. The businessman is understood to be determined to hold on to his cash, claiming that his wife will be well provided for by Cowell. The Mail on Sunday has also learned that the agreement included a ‘no-cheat’ clause, which Mr Silverman is likely to attempt to use. The source said: ‘If the divorce court agrees with Andrew that Simon and Lauren had an adulterous affair, Andrew won’t have to pay any alimony beyond what was set out in the pre-nup’. The businessman is also bidding for full custody of their seven-year-old son, Adam, and plans to accuse his wife of being a poor parent. But a friend of Mrs Silverman insisted yesterday that the New York housewife is a fantastic mother, and claimed Cowell was not the cause of the marriage split. Mrs Silverman is ‘outraged’ by her husband’s anger and claims he was seeing other women, it was claimed last night. Website TMZ cited unnamed sources close to her who claimed: ‘She hooked up with Simon partly because Andrew was cavorting around the world and partying with girls on various continents. It was a mutual understanding.’ Lauren Silverman snuggling with Simon Cowell on his yacht believed to be taken in January 2013 . She is also vowing to fight her husband’s claim for custody. TMZ said: ‘Andrew wants full custody but Lauren is saying no way in hell will he get that. Lauren says she wants prime custody and will fight tooth and nail to get it.’ Cowell’s friend added: ‘She was still technically married – but the truth is her marriage was irreparably damaged when she and Simon became an item. She’s totally in love and almost obsessed. She really wants to marry him, but who knows if she will get him down the aisle. ‘Her and Andrew’s marriage was never made in heaven and they argued a lot right from the start.’ Andrew’s parents Eleanora and Allen are understood to have frowned on their future daughter-in-law from the beginning – and even boycotted the couple’s 2003 wedding at New York’s St Regis hotel because they considered her a ‘gold-digger’. Yesterday, Mr Silverman was with his estranged wife at their £2.5 million home in Bridgehampton, New York. The source added: ‘He went there for the sake of his son. ‘He wants to try and keep things as normal as possible for Adam.’ By MATT SANDY . Andrew Silverman owns a casino in Panama where locals say prostitution is rife . The cuckolded husband of the socialite carrying Simon Cowell’s baby owns a casino in Panama where locals say prostitution is rife. Andrew Silverman is a strait-laced property developer in New York, writes Matt Sandy, but he also owns a 300-bedroom hotel and casino in Panama City, said to be the largest in Central America, that has become a hub for sex workers. Andrew and his brother Alexander bought the Veneto Hotel and Casino in a £39million deal in 2007through their company, Silver Entertainment. The decision to invest in Panama City, where prostitution is legal, is curious, given its reputation as a low-rent Las Vegas-style ‘Sin City’. Their ambition was to turn the hotel, which has 42 casino tables, into a high-end property they couldthen sell to a major hotel chain for a profit. In the meantime the casino teems with prostitutes. Hotel workers, tourists and the prostitutes themselves all confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that the Veneto has a more lenient policy on soliciting than some other high-end hotels in Panama City. When this newspaper visited the 18-storey complex on Friday evening, at least 30 prostitutes were openly soliciting for business on the casino floor, while tourist police and security guards stood by and watched. There is no suggestion that the hotel is involved directly in prostitution, or that the Silvermans endorse it.","Cowell has promised to support his lover 'emotionally and financially'

"By . Caroline Graham . Lauren Silverman was forced to quit her high school after having an ‘improper relationship’ with a married teacher, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Simon Cowell’s pregnant lover was just 16 when she became involved with an English tutor, Steven Lewis, then 26, at her £19,000-a-year private school in Florida. Jerry Raphaelson, a classmate of Lauren’s at Miami Country Day School, said: ‘It was a relationship that went on for a month and a half. Virtually all the students knew about it. She was one of the good-looking, popular kids – part of the 'in' crowd. Previous loves: Steve Lewis with wife Michelle before he was forced to . leave the school over the liason with the young Silverman . ‘Steve was our English teacher. He was a very good-looking guy, high-energy, personable and very charismatic. Everyone loved him. 'He was as charming as can be. He was very outgoing, very social. He’d pat you on the back, give you a hug.’ According to another friend, who did not wish to be named, the liaison ended when it was discovered by Lauren’s mother, Carole. Wild youth: Lauren Silverman pictured last year on holiday . The friend said: ‘I think  it all blew up when Lauren’s mother picked up a phone at home – this was back in the days of landlines – and she heard an inappropriate conversation between her daughter and Steve. That’s when the s*** hit the fan.’ Lewis was dismissed while Lauren transferred to University School, Davie, 20 miles north of Miami. His father, Peter Lewis, said last night that his son quit teaching and had to move away from the area as a result. He . said: ‘He had to leave town because of this bimbo. After he left the . school, Steve worked for Fedex and worked for a rental car agency and . then his wife  got a job in Idaho over ten years ago. They have since . moved  to Montana.’ Mr . Raphaelson, 35, who now lives in Las Vegas, said: ‘It was hushed up. It . flew like wildfire through the student body but the teachers and . administration said nothing of it.

Home was a . £650,000 house in the suburb  of Hallandale Beach, Florida. Her father, Steven, now 61, ran  a property business while her mother Carole, 60, was an  estate agent. However, according to Mr Raphaelson, Lauren liked to run with the racy set even then. He said: ‘It was an affluent party crowd, and they tried to push boundaries.

He didn’t leave his wife for this girl. No . charges were ever pressed.’ According to Lauren’s schoolfriend this was because the school didn’t want a scandal. The unnamed friend said: ‘It was hushed up. He was let go very quietly. The school kind of shied away from it, because his mother worked there as a music teacher.’ Lauren was not chastened by the experience, according to her boyfriend at her next school, Charlie Ans, now  36. Speaking at his home in Miami, Mr Ans, a photographer, said: ‘One day after school we were having sex in my bedroom when I suddenly saw my door open and my mum walk in .  .  . then all hell broke loose. ‘Mum started freaking out and was screaming at us to get out of her house.

Ans added: ‘We were typical high-school students,’ he continued. ‘A few weeks later we were back at my house, making out in the shower, when my aunt suddenly turned up. 'I spotted her car pulling up in the driveway and told Lauren she needed to disappear immediately. 'She . was very slim, so managed to squeeze through my bathroom window.

He said: ‘It’s all a little crazy and hard to believe she’s the girl I once dated. Lauren is heavier than when I remember her and has obviously had a boob job. 'But she has the same shapely legs and I remember the floral tattoo chain above her left ankle.’ Although Mr Ans had heard rumours that Lauren had had an affair with a teacher at her previous school, he never asked about it. He said: ‘I didn’t really know if it was true or not. I never asked her. 'Her parents were probably pleased she was dating someone her own age. In the end, I decided to call it off as I didn’t want to be tied down and she was becoming a bit needy.

"By . Chris Greenwood . More than 20 men were being questioned last night on suspicion of running a sprawling nationwide child prostitution ring. The leaders of the network are accused of smuggling girls as young as 12 into the country before selling them for sex. Police are investigating suspected rape, violence, people trafficking, drug dealing and firearms offences. A man is led away from a bedsit near the Dover seafront. He is one of a number of Slovakian, Czech and Roma men arrested on suspicion of child exploitation . The gang was held as hundreds of officers swooped on addresses in Kent, the Midlands and West Yorkshire in one of the biggest operations of its kind. According to police, all of the 16  victims identified so far and 22 suspects are Roma immigrants  originally from Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Many have been under investigation for more than six months as police worked to identify the true scale of the vile racket. The raids are the latest to target sexual exploitation gangs, which often prey on the most vulnerable young people. Government ministers remain deeply concerned about the rise of predatory gangs that groom victims in deprived areas. The focus of the latest early-morning raids was in the Margate, Folkestone, Dover and Gravesend areas of Kent. More than 320 officers from Kent Police entered a series of addresses, including several seafront bedsits. Raids also took place in Leeds and Birmingham. A major police operation resulted in raids on properties in West Yorkshire, Kent and the Midlands . Police were accompanied by more than 100 colleagues from Slovakia, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and social workers. As the suspects were rounded up, officers offered victims – many of whom do not speak any English – opportunities to go into the care of local authorities. The girls involved, some of whom have suffered months of abuse while being moved between dingy flats, are aged between 12 and 18. Kent Chief Constable Alan Pughsley said: ‘This is one of the biggest  operations of its kind in UK policing. 'There are over 500 people involved, including social services and the  NCA, as well as more than 300 of  my staff. We are committed to  ensuring these victims can trust Kent Police to do our very best to stop  this happening.’ The prostitution network is not  the first to be uncovered that involves Roma immigrants, one of the UK’s fastest growing ethnic minorities. In February, four  members of a gang who raped and sexually abused young girls with severe learning difficulties were  jailed at the Old Bailey. A man is escorted away from a bedsit in Dover after the police raids. The leaders of the network are accused of smuggling girls as young as 12 into the country before selling them for sex . According to police, all of the 16  victims identified so far and 22  suspects are Roma immigrants originally from Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The Peterborough gang of five  men and youths, of Czech, Slovak Roma and Kurdish backgrounds, attacked five girls, the youngest aged just 12. One victim was made pregnant  by her attacker, while others were forced to have sex with men for money so the gang could buy  drugs and alcohol. The judge criticised the men for failing to learn English and said they had done a ‘disservice’ to their fellow Roma who wanted to work and build a life for themselves. The UK is believed to have one of Western Europe’s largest Roma communities, with an estimated 200,000 people. Some have forecast that the number will rise further after immigration bars were lifted for Romanians and Bulgarians in January. Chief Supt Alison Roden, who is leading the inquiry, said the force was determined to do everything it could to protect young people. Police wait outside one of the addresses they raided as part of Operation Icon. Hundreds of officers swooped on properties in Kent, the Midlands and West Yorkshire in one of the biggest operations of its kind . She said: ‘This investigation  shows how child-protection agencies can work together to protect  vulnerable young people and bring those who seek to exploit children  to justice.’ A Kent Police spokesman said the raids focused on an ‘organised  criminal network’ preying on ‘young girls from the Slovakian Roma community’. ‘This is believed to be a unique investigation into child sexual exploitation within the UK due to the number of arrests, addresses searched and victims,’ he added. He said all 22 suspects remained in custody at different Kent Police stations last night. Roma are the biggest ethnic minority in Europe, with a population of around 12million living mostly in Eastern Europe, often in poverty and subject to discrimination.

"By . Darren Boyle . Former teacher Emma Mitchell decided to abandon both her clothes and the classroom to become a stand-up comedian at the Edinburgh Festival . A former private school teacher has turned her back on education to star in her own one woman comedy show - totally NAKED - much to the approval of some of her former pupils. Emma Mitchell, 43, taught English at Sutton Valence School in Maidstone, Kent, but decided to have a career change. Now - under her stage name Miss Glory Pearl - Ms Mitchell is putting on her own show at the Edinburgh Festival next week titled ‘The Naked Stand Up.’ Ms Mitchell, who won ‘most sarcastic teacher’ in the sixth form year book many times, came up with the idea while vacuuming her home. She said: 'After I decided I wanted to do stand up, my next thought was what to wear, as an outfit tends to pigeonhole how you’re perceived as a comedian. 'I was struggling to think of a style and I thought ""I’ll just go naked"" and then realised The Naked Stand Up sounded pretty good, so I went from there. 'I’m not brave, I’m just past caring. It is just a body. I think we are so much more than a body.' Ms Mitchell, from Tonbridge, Kent, added: 'I enjoyed teaching but I felt like I was giving the kids all of my creativity and ideas, which I don’t resent them for.' 'I think they used to think I was a bit different to the other teachers. I was awarded most sarcastic teacher a few years. 'Stand up is similar to teaching in a classroom in that you have to stand in front of an audience and command their attention. 'The classic thing you need to know about me is that I used to be a school teacher. A secondary school teacher. So if any of you do want to talk at the back during the show, you will be seeing me afterwards. And I will be keeping you behind. Just to let you know it's your time you're wasting, not mine.' 'I’ve seen some of my former pupils at my previous shows. They think it’s great.' The teacher-turned comic quit her teaching job in 2005 after seven years in the role. She took a pay cut to work in advertising and became a pole dancing instructor and then a burlesque dancer in 2008 to boost her income. Ms Mitchell will perform her naked stand up show at the Edinburgh Festival from August 1 to 24, with only one night off on the 12th. Her dry humoured script is based on observational jokes and pokes fun at the laws surrounding nudity.

"By . Darren Boyle . An unlucky sword used by the losers of the Battles of Stamford Bridge, Hastings, Bannockburn and Boroughbridge over a period of 250 years is expected to reach £120,000 at auction. It is believed that the 11th century broadsword was originally carried to Britain by Viking raiders when it was captured, only to be lost a few weeks later at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. In 1314, the sword was carried to Scotland at the Battle of Bannockburn, where the owner was forced to retreat having witnessed his nephew axed to death. The sword, pictured, was on the losing side of four of the major battles which shaped English history . However, the cursed sword's bad luck continued at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322, when the unfortunate owner was speared in the anus and killed. Now, the weapon is going to be auctioned by Christie's auction house in London. The 27-inch 11th century Viking blade features an iron cross-guard. The sword has the coat of arms of Sir Humphrey de Bohun, whose nephew Henry was killed Bannockburn by Robert the Bruce. According to Christie's the sword was captured three weeks before the Battle of Hastings after King Harold, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England defeated the Norwegian raider King Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in Yorkshire. The sword features the crest of the De Bohun family who captured it at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 . The doomed sword was used at Hastings where King Harold was defeated by William the Conqueror. Experts believe that the sword was picked up from the battlefield by Humphrey De Bohun, who was the victorious king's god father. The blade was remounted with the De Bohan coat of arms, where Sir Humphrey De Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Essex carried it north to Scotland. He was killed eight years later at the Battle of Boroughbridge where a patient pikeman speared him in the anus. Christie’s spokeswoman Dernagh O’Leary said today: 'Whilst it cannot be proved, it is not at all inconceivable that the blade of the present sword was captured or taken as a trophy by de Bohun at Hastings and was later remounted to become a family sword. 'The present sword, whilst not being a war sword, would have served as a clear badge of identity with its gold and enamelled coat of arms on the pommel and eminently more practical as a side arm around camp when not mounted and armed for battle. It is therefore entirely possible that this sword was present at Bannockburn in June 1314 if not actually on the field of battle. 'Sir Humphrey went to meet with a particularly gruesome end at the battle of Boroughbridge in Yorkshire in March 1322. 'For the last 50 years, the sword has been in the hands of two private collectors, firstly with the Australian-based Corrigan Collection, and latterly with the present, anonymous, vendor.' Sir Humphrey's unfortunate demise was later celebrated by the children's TV show Horrible Histories. The Viking sword arrived in September 1066, where it was captured at the Battle of Stamford Bridge . In September 1066 King Harald of Norway landed in Yorkshire, with Earl Tostig, the brother of the reigning English monarch King Harold. Harold marched north to challenge the Vikings who had already captured York and were threatening his throne. After freeing York, Harold confronted the Viking invaders at Stamford Bridge where the sword was picked up from the battle field by forces loyal to the English king, who returned south to face the threat posed by the Normans . One of King Harold's men carried the sword south where it was again on the losing side at Hastings . Just three weeks after the Battle of Stamford Bridge, King Harold was again facing a major challenge to his throne. This time, William the Conqueror, who had been promised the English throne by Edward the Confessor landed on the South Coast. William delayed his invasion until after Harold fought the Vikings at Stamford Bridge so his adversary's forces would be weakened. The battle took place on October 14, 1066 when William's cavalry charged the defending English troops. Historians believe the English defenders had an effective shield wall and were able to repel the initial charges until King Harold was killed in battle, reputedly by an arrow in the eye. Sir Humphrey de Bohun witnessed his nephew killed by Robert the Bruce  before fleeing with the  sword . The two-day battle between June 23-24 1314 is one of the major points in Scottish history. Outnumbered by three-to-one, the Scottish army under Robert the Bruce, routed the forces of Edward II. Among those at the battle was Sir Humphrey de Bohun, who was carrying the sword, his ancestor Humphrey de Bohan had picked up from the battle field in Hastings 200 years earlier. He witnessed his nephew Henry de Bohun charge Robert the Bruce across the battlefield where the Scottish king struck the English knight in the head. Sir Humphrey fled the scene and was captured - along with his sword. Sir Humphrey de Bohan was killed at Boroughbridge . Eight years after escaping with his life at Bannockburn, Sir Humphrey de Bohan was marching against troops loyal to Edward II. Sir Humphrey tried to charge forces guarding a wooden bridge in Boroughbridge in Yorkshire, with his unlucky sword. As he reached the bridge, a man using a pike, stabbed Sir Humphrey from below, reportedly ramming the weapon through his anus. Sir Humphrey was fighting for the Earl of Lancaster, who was contesting the English throne. Following his defeat, the Earl of Lancaster was captured and later executed for treason. Historians believe that Edward II's men had learned several of the tactics deployed by the Scottish at Bannockburn to defeat his rivals. A Christie’s expert said: 'The whereabouts of the sword prior to Corrigan’s ownership is not known, but the mention of a family sword bearing the de Bohun arms in Sir Humphrey’s will and the use of a mid-11th century Viking blade makes for an interesting train of thought potentially linking significant events of British history from the Vikings, Hastings and Bannockburn through this object. 'A series of x-rays which accompany the sword support the age of the items and show no modern repairs.” The sword blade is described as 'an extremely rare late medieval broadsword, with earlier Viking blade, and bearing the arms of the De Bohun family'. A memorial for the Battle of Boroughbridge, Yorkshire,  where the unlucky sword lost yet another owner . Celia Harvey, Christie’s Head of Sale, said: 'We are delighted to be offering this extremely rare sword during the year in which the Battle of Bannockburn celebrates its 700th birthday. 'We imagine that the sword will be of broad interest to collectors of historical artefacts or arms and armours as well as to museums and institutions. 'The sword will be on display for a month at our South Kensington saleroom which will allow it the publicity and exposure it deserves.' The sword, pictured, is expected to sell for between £80,000 and £120,000 later this summer in London .","The sword was first lost by Norwegian raiders at Stamford Bridge in 1066 .

"By . Chris Greenwood . He is famously so enamoured with bicycles that he installed thousands across London so that everybody could have a go. But in private Boris Johnson seems to occasionally prefer something with a bit more luxury than a rusty two-wheeler. The London Mayor has been reportedly spotted in a chauffeur-driven BMW - complete with a number plate reading ‘MAY10R’. Check the label Boris Johnson was pictured travelling in a BMW with a personalised number plate which read: MAY 10R . His trademark blond mop of hair was seen in the back of the prestige car as it travelled along the M4 from Heathrow towards Central London. It is believed that the colourful Tory politician had just been on holiday to Greece with his long-suffering wife Marina. He headed straight to Westminster while his wife, in a matching chauffeur-driven BMW, headed for the couple’s North London home. The personalised plate highlighting his role at the top of the Capital’s City Hall is believed to be worth around £20,000. But mystery surrounds why he came to be using it because it is not a Transport for London vehicle and Boris owns a bashed up 14-year-old Toyota people carrier. His use of the number plate is even more perplexing because of his potential return to the ranks of Tory MPs in Westminster. Taking up a seat is the first step Boris must take before challenging for the leadership of his party after the 2015 General Election. Within days of his luxury ride it was back to business as usual as Boris was seen on his trusty bicycle during the Tube strike. They see me rollin': The bespoke number plate is expected to be worth £20,000 . Last Friday, the Mayor - who has yet to confirm whether he will run for a third term in 2016 - was back on the Tube at Putney. Boris is not the only Mayor to have access to a personalised plate. The Lord Mayor of London - an entirely different office - has use of a 1980s Rolls Royce Phantom with the plate LM 0. According to the DVLA, the ‘MAY10R’ plate was first sold at auction about 20 years ago for just paltry £2,000. But a spokesman added: ‘The value will have increased quite a lot by now. It all depends on demand. ‘I can imagine this one is quite special. There are some similar plates out there - M4YOR for example - which are on the market for up to £25,000.’ A spokesman for the Mayor confirmed he was in the vehicle, adding that he had ‘organised the car privately’.","Car was seen on M4 as Mayor travelled from Heathrow .

Prosecutor Iain O'Donnell said: 'Thirty-four dogs were removed from the premises. Photographs show the disgusting conditions in which they were living.' Curtis admitted three counts of animal cruelty and was ordered to pay court costs of £27,361.99 and a £60 victim surcharge. The court costs were so high because of the length of the time it took to bring the prosecution against her. She was also sentenced to a 12-month community order with 240 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from keeping horses for 12 months.

"By . James Slack . and Daniel Martin . and Chris Greenwood . Derek Passmore smashed the skull of his disabled victim. Police have been searching for the 49-year-old, who beat Paul Craig to death in a  jealous rage, since last June . At least three killers are on the run after absconding from open prison, including a murderer who smashed his disabled victim’s head in. One of the men has been at large for nine years, it emerged last night. MPs said the public were being put at risk by the policy of allowing dangerous life-sentence prisoners to go on day release. The revelations came as police . continue to hunt for Michael Wheatley, the serial armed robber known as . the ‘Skull Cracker’, who disappeared from his open prison in Kent on . Saturday. The thug – who was serving 13 life sentences for a string of raids on banks and building societies – was spotted in the Strawberry Hill area of Twickenham, South-West London, on Monday night. A member of the public dialled 999 and said Wheatley had been seen in several pubs and a ‘club’, which is believed to be a snooker hall. But police failed to apprehend him and fear the fugitive could try to travel to Ireland, Cheshire or North Wales where he has friends, including other former prisoners. At Westminster, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling came under pressure to explain why Wheatley – who battered his victims with an imitation pistol – had been moved to open conditions. The case also threw the spotlight on other hardened convicts who had absconded. Officials admitted that police were hunting three other  killers, including two murderers and a man guilty of manslaughter. Chillingly, one of the murderers – Derek Passmore – smashed the skull of his disabled victim. Police have been searching for the 49-year-old, who beat Paul Craig to death in a  jealous rage, since last June. At his sentencing in 1997, the court heard Passmore battered his victim’s skull after ‘erroneously’ thinking Mr Craig was seeing his estranged girlfriend. Mr Craig, who was crippled with arthritis, was left dying in a flat in Hampton, Middlesex. Passmore was sentenced to a minimum of 11 years behind bars and had been moved to HMP Ford, in Sussex, to prepare him for release when he fled while on day release. The other murderer, 53-year-old David Richards, absconded in 2005 and has still not been found. Since 2004/05, a total of 106  murderers have walked free after being allowed to serve their sentence in an open prison. The  figure was revealed in a Parliamentary answer to backbench Tory MP Philip Davies. The revelations came as police continue to hunt for Michael Wheatley (pictured here in a police handout in 2002), the serial armed robber known as the 'Skull Cracker', who disappeared from his open prison in Kent on Saturday . Last night, he told the Mail: ‘The public will be horrified that people like this are in open  prisons in the first place and  that they can just walk out of  the gates. ‘These instances show that it is not a theoretical risk that  dangerous prisoners will abscond – it is a practical risk. The Michael Wheatley case is not a one-off. The public is being put unnecessarily at risk.’ He added: ‘There are 640 people serving life sentences in open prisons. We can’t allow the public to be put at risk in this way. ‘We need an urgent review of who is being put in open prison, and action taken to stop murderers and rapists from being put there in the first place. ‘Open prisons should be for people like [tax evader] Lester Piggott, not murderers and  rapists.’ Mr Grayling admitted there had been ‘too many’ absconds from open jails, with one inmate going on the run every two days. Between May 2010 and April 2013, more than 580 prisoners absconded. Eighteen are still at large. Wheatley was serving 13 life sentences for a string of raids on banks and building societies, and was spotted in the Strawberry Hill area of Twickenham, South-West London, on Monday night . Asked why Wheatley was in open jail in the first place, Mr Grayling said: ‘I want to know that as well and I am carrying out an inquiry into the individual circumstances of the case.’ He told Sky News: ‘I have not been happy with the system we have had in place. We have had a number of incidents over the past few months’. Mr Grayling said he was changing the rules so offenders would have to wear a tag when they were on day release, but admitted he did not yet have the ‘technology’. Officials say the system may not be up and running until the autumn. Mr Grayling said that, if and when he was caught, Wheatley would be put back in closed  conditions and would be made to spend a ‘considerable time longer’ behind bars. Other killers who have gone on the run over the past year include Paul Flint, a convicted murderer and burglar who walked out  of Ford. Sussex Police said they believed he may be linked to two burglaries while he was at large. He was recaptured last  September after being on the loose for four months. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘We take all absconds very seriously. Under this Government, absconds have fallen to historically low levels – down by 84 per cent in the past ten years. ‘We rigorously risk-assess all those placed in open prison  to ensure they are suitable for those conditions. ‘The rules have also been toughened up so prisoners will only be allowed out on day release for a specific purpose, such as gaining work experience.’","One of men has been at large for nine years, it emerged last night .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A New York man who wandered into a McDonald's with a knife sticking out of his back on Tuesday says he was stabbed when he tried to break up a fight. Andrew Hardy said he headed to the fast-food restaurant because he thought its security cameras would prevent his attacker from following him. Customers inside the McDonald's quickly rushed to help Mr Hardy, who had blood pouring from his shirt and a kitchen knife still lodged in his back. Close call: Andrew Hardy wandered into a McDonald's with a knife in his back and blood pouring down his shirt . The 53-year-old had been due to meet his daughter at the cinema, but instead had to call and tell her he was injured. Mr Hardy said that he called his daughter and told her: 'Yo, we might not be going to the movies. I got a knife sticking out my back.' 'She got hysterical, naturally ... but I . still kept my cool because, if I had really got hurt, stabbed-stabbed, I . would have really known that it had hit some vital. Sh*t, I got a cool . demeanor,' he told the New York Post. Customers inside the McDonald's described the stabbing as shocking, and said they tried to help Mr Hardy in case he fell on to his back and made the injury worse. ‘I heard everybody screaming and it was a lot of commotion,’ Tromaine Yancey told CBS. ‘The guy came and he was standing there with a knife in his back and it was a kitchen knife.’ Attacked: Hardy, who had been on his way to the cinema, claims he was stabbed when he tried to break up a fight .

Mr Hardy claimed to have come across a fight, where two men had ganged up on a third person. He said he felt the knife go in him, but when he turned round his attacker had fled. 'When I felt [the knife], I just . thought, ""Get to safety"", which was why I put myself in front of a . camera, in case the dude come back at me,' he said. Police have said they are confident they will catch the person responsible, but claimed to CBS New York that Mr Hardy was not being cooperative with their investigation.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and James Daniel . and Snejana Farberov . 'Sadist': Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, an undocumented immigrant from Poland, pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of animal cruelty in the brutal torture of a small pit bull puppy . An undocumented immigrant from Poland pleaded not guilty this morning in Quincy, Massachusetts, to 11 counts of animal cruelty for allegedly torturing a tiny pit bull dubbed 'Puppy Doe' and leaving her for dead in August. A judge ordered Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, held on $500,000 bail pending a November 21 pretrail hearing. Prosecutors said Czerkawski obtained the dog free of charge on Craigslist and spent weeks brutally abusing her before dumping the tormented puppy in a Quincy park. The pet later had to be put down due to the severity of her injuries. The 1-to-2-year-old pooch reportedly was stabbed in the eye, burned, had her limbs pulled from the joints and had her tongue sliced in half like a serpent. 'I just want to know so bad why he did it. Why her, of all dogs? What did she ever do to him to make him want to hurt her so bad? She loved everybody,' Puppy Doe's former owner Laura Hankins told the Boston Herald. Investigators said they found Puppy Doe's blood in the second-floor Quincy residence where the 32-year-old illegal immigrant was living. According to prosecutors, Czerkawski worked as a home attendant, caring for a 95-year-old Polish dementia patient woman in Quincy, Boston Herald reported. Police say Czerkaswki left Puppy Doe in the park a day after his client passed away. Her death certificate stated that the woman died from 'failure to thrive' caused by her illness. Authorities do not believe that Czerkaswki had anything to do with the woman’s passing. Unholy act: Czerkawski is suspected of stealing 11 checks worth $6,000 from St. Lawrence the Martyr Church in New Bedford, Ma., in April 2012 . When asked during a press conference . Tuesday about a motive behind the sadistic animal abuse, Quincy Police . Chief Paul Keenan said: ‘Who has a motive for something like this? He's . probably just a sick individual.’ Following . Czerkaswki’s arrest in New Britain, Connecticut, Sunday, police in New . Bedford, Massachusetts, announced that the 32-year-old was a suspect in . the theft of $6,000 from a local church, South Coast Today said. Czerkawski is accused of stealing and cashing 11 checks from St Lawrence the Martyr Church, where he had stayed between January and April 2012 after telling the pastor there that he wanted to become a priest. A month after the 32-year-old man left for Canada, the church noticed that three of its accounts were missing a total of $6,000. Czerkawski, a native of Hrubieszow, Poland, has been staying in the U.S. on a tourist visa that expired last month, according to The Patriot Ledger. Besides the charges in the Puppy Doe case, which carry a five-year prison term each, he is expected to face 11 counts of larceny by check over $250 and a single count of larceny in a building in connection to the New Bedford case. Caught: Radoslaw Czerkawski is being held on a fugitive from justice charge in New Britain, Connecticut. Police in Massachusetts believe he could be involved with the dog abuse case . The 32-year-old suspect was found at a La Quinta hotel last Wednesday morning, police said, and appeared in New Britain Superior Court Monday to start the rendition process back to Massachusetts. The charges against Czerkawski is the first significant break in the two-month investigation into the animal cruelty case that sparked outrage among dog lovers from coast to coast. During Czerkawski's arraignment Tuesday, animal activists filled the Quincy courtroom to support Puppy Doe. Outraged dog owners and their four-legged friends also waited outside the courthouse. 'She didn’t deserve what she got. We’re definitely here with our puppies to support her,' dog owner Kelly Duncan told WBZ NewsRadio 1030. Cruel: This two-year-old pit bull was found with horrific injuries . Cops . have spent weeks following the trail of people who have owned the dog, . which had been given away at least once on Craigslist’s animal-adoption . pages by a woman who owned the dog last year. Police . and much of the public have been on the hunt for the suspect since the . female pit bull was found on August 31st close to a local playground. Quincy, . Massachusetts Police, the Animal Rescue League of Boston and the Office . of the District Attorney for the Norfolk District in Massachusetts have . been investigating. Abused: Puppy Doe weighed only 18lb and had been stabbed, burned and tortured . 'Please . be assured that these three agencies are working in concert to identify . and hold accountable the person or persons responsible for the torture . of Puppy Doe. It is highly unlikely that this level of sadistic cruelty . could be shown to one animal and not be part of a pattern involving . other animals or perhaps vulnerable people' Norfolk District Attorney . Michael Morrissey said in a statement. The two-year-old dog, found near a . Massachusetts play park, had been beaten, burned, starved and stabbed in . the eyes in what was described as 'medieval' torture . Animal . rescue workers described the injuries inflicted on the pit bull, . including a crude split to give it a forked serpent tongue, as the worst . they had ever seen. Veterinarians . at the Animal Rescue League of Boston who treated the dog said that she . was emaciated and weighed half of what would be expected for a two year . old. Sweet natured: Despite having broken bones, crushed vertebrae and other injuries, the pit bull was friendly . The dog’s tongue had been split on . purpose. She had also been burned on the nose, stabbed in the eye, and . beaten so severely that she could barely walk. The pit bull had to be . put down due to the extent of her injuries. When she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car, but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light. Vet . Martha Smith-Blackmore was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that . she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog's . body. 'Her joints were pulled apart like medieval times,' she said. 'She was beaten, stabbed, burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life. And could not walk.' The . vet added: 'When I saw how vulnerable she was and I understood . immediately the duration of her suffering, my heart collapsed.' Torture: The dog's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart . Public outrage saw a number of tips come flooding in to help the Quincy police department in tracking the perpetrator, along with thousands of dollars that had been set aside for a reward. The Animal Rescue League of Boston offered $5,000, followed by the California-based Animal Legal Defense League put up $2,000. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals offered up another $5,000, and Second Chance Rescue out of New York raised $11,000 for information. The Animal Rescue League raised also raised $35,000 additionally to be put toward the investigation of this and other animal abuse cases. The story has prompted Facebook groups that have become the sites of a tremendous outpouring of outrage and grief, and resulted in a vigil held for 'Puppy Doe.' In pain: The dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep . Horrified: Vet Martha Blackmore-Smith says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered . Although there was no evidence of . sexual interference, which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases, . the dog's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly. Despite the pain and . suffering Puppy Doe had clearly experienced in her short life, staff at . the rescue center said she was sweet natured. 'Within . hours of being found she had pain medication, food and love. She . experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life,' Dr . Smith-Blackmore said, adding that the dog's injuries were so severe she . would have always been in pain if she hadn't been put down. As well as the burn and stab marks, the dog's vertebrae had been smashed from being hit by a baseball bat or board.","Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, faces 11 counts of animal cruelty, each charge carrying five-year prison sentence .

"By . James Daniel . It could be an example of life imitating art... or is it simply a dog marking its territory? Perhaps, this little pup is saying exactly what he thinks of this latest piece of graffiti in New York by the mysterious British artist Banksy? Either way, the mural has captured both the imagination of the public and dogs alike. Dogged intuition: It looks like a regular fire hydrant so why shouldn't I lift my leg? Advice: I wouldn't sit there if I were you! Art? The graffiti by elusive British artist Banksy is part of his month-long Better Out Than In exhibit, in New York . Enticing: Seems as though dogs find Banksy's work more interesting close up than people do! Banksy is staging a month-long ‘residency’ in New York City, but it seems that he's having a tough time of it. His first two works were vandalized within hours of being created. The reclusive artist announced he would be ‘attempting to host an entire show on the streets of New York’ throughout October in a project called Better Out Than In. The first of Banksy's new pieces showed two boys wearing caps, with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said 'Graffiti Is A Crime' The first piece was found on the streets of the Lower East Side neighborhood in Manhattan. It showed two boys wearing caps, with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said ‘Graffiti Is A Crime.’ The work, called ‘The street is in play’, was accompanied by a telephone number which passersby could call for an audio guide to the painting. The audio informed viewers somewhat prophetically: ‘Before you, you will see a spray art by the artist Banksy. Or maybe not. It's probably been painted over by now.’ But within hours of its whereabouts being announced, the work had been first whitewashed and then covered with other clearly inferior graffiti . But no sooner had word got out about the art work than it had been defaced, first with whitewash and then with other inferior graffiti which read: 'Sweaty palms made me lose the love of my life!' A second piece of art was then uncovered in the Chelsea neighborhood underneath the High Line tourist attraction. The white, spray-painted text read: ‘This is my New York accent’ in a traditional graffiti font, while underneath it was sprayed in a sans serif font: ‘…normally I write like this.’ But that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top of it. Banksy, a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of Bristol, England and whose real identity is unknown, has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world, known for his trademark spray-paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary. A second Banksy piece was uncovered in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York underneath the High Line tourist attraction . Unfortunately that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top .

"By . James Daniel . and Ryan Gorman . Minnesota Vikings' star Adrian Peterson first encounter with his now-dead son came when he visited the dying boy at the hospital, it has been revealed. Having found out about the boy only months ago after the mother started having paternity tests to figure out the father, the footballer was planning a trip to see the child later this month. Sadly, his visit came much sooner and under much different circumstances than he envisioned. Mr Peterson skipped practice Friday to fly to South Dakota to see his battered son, in the hospital fighting for his life after Joseph . Robert Patterson, 27, the mother's boyfriend, was charged on Friday with aggravated assault and aggravated . assault on an infant. The two-year-old boy, named Ty, passed away on Friday at a South Dakota hospital after being . admitted on Wednesday. The football star's father Nelson confirmed that . the boy who died was his grandson. Charged: Joseph Robert Patterson, pictured in court today, left, is charged with aggravated battery of an infant and aggravated assault. It emerged in court that he had previously been charged over domestic violence . Requests for privacy: NFL star Adrian Peterson, pictured at a press conference today, acknowledged   that he was dealing with a 'private matter' but said little else. It is believed that his 'secret' son died today after being beaten by the boyfriend of the child's mother . First reported by TMZ, Mr Peterson never questioned being the child's father and offered to help any way he could. With plans to meet the boy later this month, it appears the former MVP was planning to take an active role in his son's life. Sadly, that involvement was limited to a hospital visit only hours before the boy was taken off life support and likely the upcoming funeral. Mr Peterson has never met Mr Patterson, sources told TMZ. The grieving father is now pushing for his toddler son's organs to be donated to people in need. The supposed killer appeared in court on Friday to be arraigned on the felony assault charges. Additional charges may be added now that the child has died, South . Dakota State’s Attorney's office said. The little boy was brutally beaten on Wednesday while in the violent man's home at Platinum Valley Apartments, Sioux Falls where he had recently moved with his mother. He was the sole caregiver at the time. Initially, . police were told that the child had choked on candy. Only later did it . emerge that his brain injuries were the result of being violently shaken. The arrest was made . after police found the little boy with injuries 'consistent with . abuse'. Mr Patterson is being held in Minnehaha County Jail, South Dakota on $750,000 cash bond and was scheduled to appear in court on October 23 but that will likely change in the wake of the toddler's death. South Dakota State’s Attorney Thomas Wollman filed motions on Friday ordering Mr Patterson to serve two year-long sentences that had been suspended on prior domestic assault charges. Mr Patterson had pleaded guilty in 2012 to simple assault in an incident involving an ex-girlfriend and her three-year-old son. The woman requested a protection order saying the vicious man had spanked her little boy so hard that she had to ice the welts on his buttocks, according to the Argus. She also said that he choked and punched her, threatened her with a knife . and held her in the bedroom against her will, according to records. The woman asked for the protection orders prior to the birth of the son she has with Mr Patterson. As part of his prior charges, Mr Patterson was ordered to undergo family violence training and to stay . away from the woman until completing it. A different woman requested a protection order against Patterson in 2004 in Jackson County. Remembered: Vanja Srdie shares a memory about Minnesota Vikings' Adrian Peterson's two-year-old son during a candlelight vigil at Sertoma Park in Sioux Falls . Family, friends and well-wishers gather to say goodbye to the little boy who was killed, allegedly by his mother's boyfriend . It is believed by officials that Mr Patterson only recently began a relationship with the mother of the child he allegedly killed. A candlelit vigil was held in Sertoma Park, Sioux Falls to remember the little boy on Friday. One woman told the Argus Leader that Ty 'was a spunky boy full of life, who was ''always running, jumping and into everything... but whose big brown eyes made it hard to be mad at him'. Another attendee, Vanja Srdic, 27, described the two-year-old as 'very happy, very strong-willed, so much potential, a go-getter little boy. His mom was his world'. Following the news of his son's death, the NFL star tweeted: 'Thank you to my family, my fans and fans of other teams for their support. 'The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players. Peterson added: 'God Bless everyone and thank u so much.' Peterson has been . pictured publicly with his son Adrian Jr, who is two, but it was another two-year-old boy who died on Friday. The football star also has a ten-year-old daughter named Adeja.

Sending prayers up for you homie! Nothing I can . say can help u through.'. Baseball player Bryce Harper wrote: . 'Prayers go out to @AdrianPeterson and his family! What a cruel world we . live in! Truly unbelievable! #GodBless' A friend of the boy's mother in Sioux Falls told CityPages . that the mother of the child had a casual relationship with the NFL . star when she lived in Twin Cities but had since moved to South . Dakota. A recent paternity . test revealed that Peterson was the little boy's father. The child has . his mothers' last name and the father is not identified on the birth . certificate. Peterson knew that he was the father of the child before he was tragically killed. In a phone interview with the Pioneer Press, Nelson Peterson said the injured boy is not Adrian Jr., but is his grandson.

Family: Adrian Peterson's two-year-old son Adrian Jr., lives at home with the footballer . 'All . I can say is, we are asking for prayers and for respect for our family . as we deal with this tragic situation,' Nelson Peterson said. Mr Peterson spoke to the media on Friday afternoon and thanked everyone for their support. He told reporters he was dealing with the situation and has asked for privacy. 'I really appreciate all the support that I’ve been receiving from fans, the Vikings organization,' he said. 'This . is a private matter and I would ask you all to please just respect my . privacy and not ask at all about the situation at hand. Thanks.' Patterson was charged with assault in 2012 and ordered to undergo family violence training . Asked . about his mindset, Mr Peterson said: 'Football is something I will always . fall back on. It gets me through tough times. Just being around the guys . in here, that’s what I need.' He said that he will be playing for the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday in a home game against the Carolina Panthers. However a Viking source told ESPN that following his son's death that 'could change'. Sioux Falls Police Department spokesman Sam Clemens said many people have asked about the identity of the boy's father. 'At . this point, we're not going to confirm anything. Who the father is does . not come into play in this investigation, so we’re not going to be . releasing any information as far as that goes,' he said. 'We're . not here to talk about the parents of this child,' said Mr Wollman. 'We wouldn't talk in a normal case about who . the parents are.' He then asked that people respect the family's privacy. 'The parents and extended family are suffering greatly.' Sioux Falls Police Department spokesman Sam Clemens said many people have asked about the identity of the boy's father. 'At this point, we're not going to confirm anything. Who the father is does not come into play in this investigation, so we’re not going to be releasing any information as far as that goes,' he said.

"By . James Daniel . One wrong turn was all it took. A 34-year-old Canadian woman, who entered a half-marathon in Ontario accidentally took a wrong turn and ended up winning the whole thing. Meredith Fitzmaurice entered the Sunday’s Run for Heroes Marathon as a test run. Then she was going to try to achieve a Boston Marathon qualifying time at a race in Detroit next month. Accidental winner: Meredith Fitzmaurice, 34, won the woman's full marathon, but only after taking a wrong turn from the half-marathon course . But at some point during Sunday’s race, she realized that she had been running for far longer than she had anticipated. ‘I just run with my watch, so I was watching my time since I planned to do my half in under 1:28,’ she said. ‘I was doing the race as training for my first full marathon in Detroit. But I’m looking at the time and wondering where the finish line is,’  Fitzmaurice explained to Metro News. After realising her mistake, Ms Fitzmaurice spoke to a race director who was riding along the route on a bike. ‘The guy was awesome,’ she recalled. ‘And once he said I was good to go, my adrenaline just kicked in.’ Qualified: Meredith's time was so good she has now qualified to run in next April's Boston marathon . With a time of 3:11:48, Fitzmaurice was the first woman to cross the finish line and the tenth person overall – good enough to qualify for Boston. ‘I didn’t even realize I was the first female until people started yelling at me and high-fiving me. Once I crossed the finish line and realized the magnitude of what I had done, I started crying.’ In an interview with the Windsor Star, she said that her headphones put her in the zone, perhaps distracting her. Ms. Fitzmaurice said that she had never run more than 20 miles before and had no idea that she was first among women competitors. She credits her win to ‘the guy on the bike’ – an official who accompanied her for the last 10k. ‘When I crossed the finish line I saw my friend and I started to cry and then I hugged the guy on the bike,’ said Fitzmaurice. ‘Without him I wouldn’t have been able to do it.’ ‘I had only ever run 20 miles, but I think at that point the adrenalin just pulled me through,’ she said. ‘I just kept thinking you can do this, just get it done. The last couple miles were really tough.’ Whilst her victory may have been the result of a wrong turn, her winning time of 3:11:48 proves it was no accident.

"By . James Daniel . A New Hampshire jury has rejected a claim that a woman developed post-traumatic stress disorder that made her fear the frozen food aisle in stores because she found a rat in her frozen lemonade.

Ms. Grady claimed her . friends were pouring the can of lemonade into a pitcher when a dead rat . and maggots fell out causing her emotional distress. She told the court that she was forced to keep the dead rat in her freezer for more than a week until a Coca-Cola Company courier arrived to pick it up.

The frozen rat, Grady’s attorney said, was on display throughout the three-day civil trial.

Patty, a female Fox Terrier, was found skinned from the back of her neck to her ears, along with a stab wound to her side, in southwest Detroit. She is in serious but stable condition at the Emergency Veterinarian Hospital in Ann Arbor. Scroll down for video... Brutal: Patty was found skinned from the back of her neck to her ears in southwest Detroit . Critical condition: Vets attempted to reattach the dogs' fur but the operation was not successful . 'Her prognosis is good, but we’ll have to wait and see if some of the skin that was reattached will stay alive,' said Dr. Amanda Houk of the Ann Arbor Veterinary Hospital to Detroit News. Dr. Houk said the dog will remain at the veterinary hospital for at least a couple more days. The hospital’s main concern now is controlling pain and long-term wound management. 'A dog can survive without its fur, but we’re concerned about infection,' she said. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES FOLLOW . What happened? The dog had obviously been well looked after because her nails had even been painted . Skinned alive: The dog was found in a residential area of southwest Detroit . Willful: Vets believe the attack was deliberate because the cutting marks are so clean and accurate . 'If the dog were out in the wild after this happened, she could have gotten sick from bacteria getting inside the blood,' she said. A $1,000 reward is now being offered for information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the case. Timothy Williams found Patty on his front porch. He told WXYZ he couldn't believe what he saw. 'It was literally cut from shoulder to shoulder around. It was a perfect cut. She was in shock. She was shivering.' Neighbors noticed Patty walking around outside with a large patch of fur hanging off of her bleeding neck. 'Her skin is hanging off the side her body and is clean cut from the back of her neck to her ears. This was not an accident. The cuts are perfect and deliberate,' said Joanne Dixon of Providing For Paws. 'Someone owned and loved this dog. Her nails are painted.' Operation: Veterinary surgeons tried to reattach the fur to the dog but they were unsuccessful . Intentional: The attackers also stabbed little Patty, a Fox Terrier in the side . Elisandra Figueroa, an animal rights activist who operates Providing for Paws in southwest Detroit, where she’s lived for 44 years, said the organization is printing fliers to distribute across the city. 'We want to find out who did this,' said Ms. Figueroa, the organization’s volunteer vice president. 'Somebody intentionally did this. They stabbed her in the side of her chest and skinned her from the back of her neck to her ear. This was no dog fight.'

"By . James Daniel . A 400-foot section of a bridge in Wisconsin has been closed after a motorist noticed the bridge was beginning to sag. The Leo Frigo Bridge suddenly began to dip forcing police to close off the span that carries Interstate 43 over the Fox River some 120 feet below. ‘There's a part that's sagging,’ a driver told a 911 operator. ‘A part that's sagging?’ the operator asked. ‘Instead of a bump, it's a dip,’ the driver said. Scroll down for video... Cheese dip: A span on the Leo Frigo Memorial Bridge in Green Bay shows signs of buckling in this view looking west . Sagging: Authorities say a section of the Interstate 43 bridge, about 150 to 200 yards long, dipped about three feet across all four lanes. No one has been injured. Police closed the bridge, known as the Leo Frigo Memorial Bridge, before sunrise Wednesday . It appears the dip was caused by one of the pillars that holds up the bridge which sank around two feet into the ground. The bridge, which carries 40,000 cars a day, will be closed indefinitely. ‘We understand the disruption this is going to cause to traffic,’ said Wisconsin Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb. As straight as an arrow: Here's how it normally looks... without any kinks . The bridge was built in 1980 and last inspected in August 2012 when it was declared sound and renovated shortly thereafter. The closure created traffic chaos in Green Bay. Cause: The likely culprit is the settling of Pier 22, a support pillar that is on the east approach to the bridge. The pier settled a little over two feet, and the state DOT will continue taking periodic measurements to see if it's continuing to move . ‘It's a big hassle, because of all the construction that's going around town,’ said Dennis Kelln of Green Bay. ‘The downtown bridge was closed for how long? Now this one is out? It's just like it's a never-ending problem here.’ Governor Scott Walker spoke on the closure Wednesday afternoon during a press conference. 'It's a key transportation link in the area,' Walker said. 'Our #1 priority is and will continue to be ensuring the absolute safety of the public.' The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has set up detours in the meantime. The DOT doesn't have a timeline or a price tag on fixing the bridge just yet. Governor Walker promised repairs will happen, whatever the cost. 'Once we know the full details of what's required to fix this bridge, we will fix this bridge,' the governor said, 'because it's not only important to Brown County, it's also important to the State of Wisconsin.' Governor Walker said the Interstate-43 bridge over the Fox River is 'vitally important' to commerce in Northeast Wisconsin and Michigan but that the safety of people who would be on or around the bridge will be the primary factor in determining how long the bridge will be closed. 'Once we know the full details of what's required to fix this bridge, we will fix this bridge,' Governor Walker said, 'because it's not only important to Brown County, it's also important to the State of Wisconsin' Diversions in place: The bridge, formerly known as the Tower Drive bridge, will remain closed indefinitely as inspections continue . State officials say the bridge is in no danger of collapsing like the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Mount Vernon, Washington, this spring. In that incident, a tractor-trailer struck a support on the bridge, which had been rated ‘functionally obsolete,’ sending several cars plunging into the river below. No one died, but three people were taken to the hospital for treatment . The Wisconsin bridge is named after Leo Frigo, who ran Frigo Cheese Corp. until his retirement in 1983. A former member of Roman Catholic religious orders, he was well-known in the area for his work with ex-convicts and for founding a Green Bay food pantry, according to his official biography on the pantry's website. He died in 2001.","400-foot section of Wisconsin bridge suddenly sags .

Once the DJ announces that the contest is in progress C100 picks the 25th caller to compete live on-air. Bell Aliant are not saying exactly what kind of technology was used to ensure they callers landed in the right place, but as the company also control the phone lines that the radio station uses, it wouldn't take a genius to come up with some sort of method. Bell Aliant are also the sister company of Bell Media who own the C100 radio station. Suspicions: Three workers at Bel Aliant have been suspended whist the radio station and phone company discover if there was any foul play . Theory: The suggestion is that somehow the workers at the phone company were able to secure their places in line on the radio station switchboard in order to qualify . Bell Aliant have released a statement regarding the issue: . 'It was brought to our attention by concerned employees that three employees were jumping ahead in the call queue for the Beat the Bank Contest on C100. We moved very quickly to alert C100 and to put a fix in place to avoid this happening for their contests in the future.' The company said it is taking the issue very seriously and an internal investigation is underway. Three employees – a man and two women –  have been suspended with pay and sent home. The statement continued: 'We take a lot of pride in the integrity of our people and our network and we are thankful that our employees were concerned enough to bring this to our attention.' 'Once brought to our attention, our contest call-in system was reviewed immediately. We remain confident in the security of the system and can ensure our listeners 'Beat the Bank' and similar contests are completely fair for all,' said the radio station. 'We hold the integrity of our contests to the highest degree. As a result, we are withholding the final winnings of these individuals pending the outcome of the investigation by Bell Aliant.' One of the employees is believed to have won $750 towards the end of August. Conflict of interest: Both the radio station, C100 and the phone company, Bell Aliant are owned by the same telecommunications group .","Contest allows listeners to try and win cash - but they have to be the 25th caller .

Bolving is the deep-throated unique to red deer stags during the rutting season. The call is designed to frighten off other stags leaving the hinds - females - to the individual stag for mating. Contestants in the World Bolving championships have to roar - or bolve - across a large valley in the hope of getting a stag to bolve back, which scores points with the judges. Over one hundred and fifty nature lovers gathered at Draydon Rails to see the ninth annual contest in aid of the Devon Air Ambulance Trust. Previous winner, Richard Eales, who now organises the event, said the contest started life as a bet among locals in the Rock Inn pub over who could get a stag to call back. Last year's winner Elvis Afanasenko, who lives on the moor, retained his world champion title at the weekend. Bolving was traditionally used across Europe to hunt deer who were a problem to farmers, but difficult to locate. A good call attracted the stags and made them easier to find.

The three women went to the water for a swim when, according to Karen Altamore, three of the children began wading across the a narrow channel dividing the main shoreline from a sandbar.

"By . Emily Crane . A Northern Territory government department's social club was forced to cancel a NAIDOC week lunch after plans to serve endangered sea turtle and dugong caused outrage. The endangered species were listed on a menu set to be served to staff from the Department of Corporate and Information Services at Marlow Lagoon, south west of Darwin, today. The lunch, to be attended with a gold coin donation, was cancelled on Wednesday after protesters threatened to storm the event and Queensland federal MP Warren Entsch labeled the menu 'appalling'. Dugong, an endangered species, was listed on a menu set to be served to staff from the Department of Corporate and Information Services at Marlow Lagoon, south west of Darwin, on Thursday . An email invite to the lunch said the menu consisted of traditional home-cooked dishes including 'kangaroo satays, chilli crab, barramundi, curry goose, coconut curry chicken, dugong, turtle, chicken vermicelli and blutchung pork'. But Mr Entsch said dugong and turtle should only be consumed in the name of traditional cultural practices, and only at the site it was taken. 'It should not be vacuum-packed and sent around the country so that people can have a taste, and it certainly should not be exchanged for a gold coin donation; these are vulnerable species, not commercial species,' Mr Entsch said. The lunch was cancelled on Wednesday after protesters threatened to storm the event and Queensland federal MP Warren Entsch labeled the menu 'appalling' He said it was 'appalling' the event was being organised by a government department, and traditional land owners would be 'highly offended'. The department's CEO Kathleen Robinson said the items were removed from the menu, and the lunch was postponed late on Wednesday as staff were uncomfortable with the attention the event had drawn. 'The DCIS NAIDOC lunch was organised by a volunteer committee of Indigenous staff members to showcase their culture to other staff with a lunch menu of traditional bush tucker,' she said in a statement. An email invite was sent out to staff to the lunch (pictured here) and the department's CEO Kathleen Robinson later apologised . 'Unfortunately, the menu had included foods that were not suitable for the event and these items were subsequently removed.' The DCIS apologised for any offence caused. 'The volunteer group worked hard to prepare for this event and their efforts and good intentions are appreciated,' Ms Robinson said. Section 211 of the Native Title Act permits indigenous people to hunt protected species such as dugongs and turtles for 'personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs'.

"By . David Mccormack . President Warren Harding famously campaigned on a platform of ‘a return to normalcy’ in the 1920s, but it’s his steamy love letters to a friends' wife that will finally be made available to the public later this month. Over a decade prior to becoming the nation's 29th president, Harding enjoyed a torrid love affair with Carrie Phillips who he eulogized in over 1,000 pages of love letters. The Harding family donated the letters - previously under court-ordered seal for 50 years - to the Library of Congress, which will finally make the letters available to the public online on July 29. Loveless marriage: President Warren Harding is pictured in 1922 with his wife Florence, but it's his steamy love letters to a friends' wife that will finally be made available to the public later this month . In his 2009 book The Harding Affair: Love And Espionage During The Great War, author James Robenalt contends that Carrie Phillips, left, was the love of Harding's life . The . letters were written between 1910 and 1920 during an affair that began . in 1905 between then-Ohio Lt. Gov. Harding and family friend Phillips. Despite Harding asking his mistress to destroy the letters, she kept every word. ‘I . do not know what inspired you, but you... resurrected me, and set me . aflame with the fullness of your beauty and the fire of your desire… . imprisoned me in your embrace and gave me transport - God! My breath . quickens to recall it,’ wrote Harding in Sept 1913 after the pair had . spent a weekend in New York. Two . months later, he wrote his love for her was ‘the surpassing influence . of my life. It is big, and glorious, and hallowed. It is full of . blessings and radiant with dreams. This photograph shows, clockwise, Warren Harding, his wife Florence, Carrie Phillips, her husband Jim . 'It could be as ardent and wild and impassioned as you have ever known it.’ Some of the letters were released to the public a decade ago when author James Robenalt was researching the president and discovered forgotten microfilm copies. In his 2009 book The Harding Affair: Love And Espionage During The Great War, Robenalt contends that Phillips may have been a German spy – or at very least a Nazi sympathizer. Robenalt has read almost all of the letters and believes that both Harding and Phillips were in barely functioning marriages. Florence Harding, who was divorced from her first, alcoholic husband, was chronically ill, Robenalt recounts. 'There isn’t one iota of affection in my home relationship,' wrote Harding. 'It is merely existence, necessary for appearance’s sake.' Although the affair ended prior to Harding's presidential inauguration in 1921, pictured, Harding and Phillips remained on good terms . 'I believe, based on everything I’ve read of these 900 pages, that [Harding’s relationship with his wife] was sterile, and that Carrie was his sexual outlet,' Robenalt told the Washington Post. Phillips chose to live for months in Europe with her daughter and away from her husband, Jim. 'This woman was clearly the love of his life,' said Robenalt. 'My Darling. There are no words, at my command, sufficient to say the full extent of my love for you - a mad, tender, devoted, ardent, eager, passion-wild, jealous... hungry... love,' he wrote on Christmas Eve 1910. 'It flames like the fire and consumes. It racks in the tortures of aching hunger, and glows in bliss ineffable - bliss only you can give.' As Harding climbed the political ladder toward presidency, it became more troublesome for the two to stay together. Although the affair ended prior to Harding’s presidential inauguration in 1921, Harding and Phillips remained on good terms. In 1922, Phillips, accompanied by her husband and mother, visited President Harding at the White House. Author Robenalt has read almost all of the letters and believes that both Harding, pictured with wife Florence, and Phillips were in barely functioning marriages . When her health failed in 1956, Phillips was admitted to a nursing home in Marion and died in 1960. Her lawyer and guardian found and retained the letters, which were hidden in a box in Phillips’ home in Marion, Ohio. The lawyer made the collection available to a potential Harding biographer in 1963, although the use of quotes from the letters in this biography was thwarted by a lawsuit brought by the president’s nephew, Dr. George Harding. An Ohio probate judge closed the papers on July 29, 1964, and after extended litigation, the Harding-Phillips letters were purchased by Dr. Harding from Phillips’ daughter, Isabelle Phillips Mathée. In 1972, Dr. Harding donated the letters to the Library of Congress for safekeeping, with the stipulation that the Library keep the papers closed until July 29, 2014, which would be 50 years from the day the probate judge first closed them. The letters have been locked in a vault in the Library’s Manuscript Division since their donation.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A Florida resident who called 911 to report a violent home invasion on was directed to voice mail when a dispatcher tried to transfer the call from the fire department to law enforcement. Unable to get a hold of police on time, the homeowner at Gwain Road in Port Richey in Pasco County grabbed a gun and shot one of the intruders who were apparently after cash and prescription pills. WTSP reports that Joseph Rich, and brothers Michael Reverdes and Steven Reverdes are now in custody after police finally arrived on the scene. Steven Reverdes was shot in the back by the homeowner. SCROLL DOWN FOR RECORDING . Joseph Rich, 31, allegedly entered a home on Wednesday to steal cash and prescription pills . Michael Reverdes, 31, was another one of the alleged intruders in Pasco County on Wednesday . Steven Reverdes, 33, was shot in the back by a homeowner when he allegedly broke in to steal cash and pills . 'Hang up and call 911,' can be heard on this chilling recording of a homeowner calling the police for help when they are in danger. The family screams in the background telling the robbers to leave the premises. Apparently the phone was transferred to voice mail after the dispatcher tried moving the call from the fire department to law enforcement. 'somebody just came into my house, four people just came into my house, they beat the s**** out of me and my wife and my stepmother, then they robbed us, ' said the homeowner. Police say that the suspects broke in the home in the middle of the night and fired shots at the homeowners, just inches away from a sleeping baby. 'The male inside said, I have a gun and will use it - the gun battle begins. They pistol-whipped the female and took a weapon and pointed it to the child and said they would kill the child if they don't get what they want,' said Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco. Fox reports that the county released a timeline showing that officers where dispatched almost 4 minutes after the call but they said that this did nothing to slow their response time. They said that they will take measures in their own hands to make sure nothing like this ever happens again but they didn't elaborate on those plans. They said that this attack was a targeted one and that residents should not be concerned for their safety. Three of the four robbers have been captured, including the man who was shot. 'I'm at a loss for words, had to protect my family,' the homeowner said about the incident. The Mail Online contacted the Pasco County Police Department but no one was available for comment.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Notorious villains: Now the story of Ronnie and Reggie Kray is being turned into a film by Oscar-winning writer, Brian Helgeland . They were gangland villains of the highest order, violent thugs who terrified London's East End as they committed a string of robberies, arsons, assaults and murders. Now the story of Ronnie and Reggie Kray is to be told in a new biopic written and directed by Oscar-winning LA Confidential writer, Brian Helgeland. And the twin brothers are to be played by one actor, London-born Tom Hardy, 36, who will indicate his change between brothers by donning glasses when he's playing Ronnie. Filming for the movie, which is still in development, began in Essex this week, and production is expected to start later this year. With the working title of Legend, the biopic is expected to focus on the Krays' organised reign of crime and terror in the London underworld of the 1950s and 1960s. And Mr Helgeland will have plenty of material. The brothers, who were born in Hoxton, east London, in 1933, began their life of violence young.  At nine, they had such a violent fight that Ronnie, the younger by ten minutes, almost died from his head injury. A decade later, and already known for their violence and thuggishness, they walked out of national service, pausing only to punch the corporal who tried to stop them, leaving him seriously injured. They were arrested and sent back to the Army, but went AWOL again, only to assault a policeman who tried to arrest them, which landed them in the Tower of London, as some of the last prisoners ever to be detained there, followed by a string of other prisons and then a dishonourable discharge from the Army. Crime took the thuggish brothers away from what could have been a promising future in boxing, and they devoted their lives to their gang, known as The Firm, while attempting a series of business ventures. The first of these was a club called The Regal off Mile End Road, which had an uninviting exterior but inside was a glamorous and decadent nightclub, overseen by the sharp-suited brothers. Despite their smooth appearances, however, the brothers were involved in a life of appalling crime, running protection rackets, as well as staging hijacks and armed robberies. Ronnie, who was considered the more violent of the two, was imprisoned for GBH in 1957, and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia during his jail term.  He was also publicly bisexual, an unusual thing to admit at the time, and something his brother found hard to come to terms with. Thugs: The Krays, pictured at home in 1966 after being quizzed by police about the murder of George Cornell . London-born actor Tom Hardy, 36, will wear thick glasses to play Ronnie, left, taking them off for Reggie, right . Terrifying: The brothers, born in 1933, led a reign of terror across London until they were jailed in 1968 . Reggie was imprisoned two years later, but by 1960 both were out of prison and had become almost celebrities, socialising with stars such as Barbara Windsor, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, as well as well as eminent politicians including Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie had an affair. In 1965, Reggie married Frances Shea, but the union only lasted a few months and she died in 1967, apparently from suicide but it was rumoured that Ronnie murdered her. The police frequently investigated the twins' activities, but with the East End living in fear of the notorious twins, no-one dared testify against them, so their misdemeanours often went unchallenged. The Firm then largely consisted of the brothers, their cousin, Albert Donoghue, and at least 13 others, including brothers Tony and Chris Lambrianou. In 1966, the Krays helped Frank Mitchell, also known as The Mad Axeman, escape from Dartmoor Prison, and put him up at a friend's flat in East Ham.  He subsequently disappeared, and while the brothers were acquitted of his murder, a later book claimed that he had been shot. Quite a story: Filming for the biopic, written and directed by Brian Helgeland, started in Essex this week . Their story was told in the 1990 British film, The Krays, in which Gary and Martin Kemp played the brothers . The same year, Ronnie shot George Cornell dead in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel.  Cornell, an associate of South London gang, the Richardsons, is said to have remarked: 'Well look who's here' just before he was shot. And In 1967, Reggie Kray murdered former gang member Jack 'The Hat' Mcvitie in Stoke Newington, stabbing him in the face and stomach with a carving knife, twisting the knife as McVitie lay dying. The brothers were finally brought to justice in the middle of 1968, when they and several members of The Firm were arrested, and both brothers given life sentences with no chance of parole for 30 years. The judge, Mr Justice Melford Stevenson, told them: 'In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.' They were allowed out of prison for their mother's funeral in 1982, but Ronnie died in Broadmoor, aged 61 in 1995, and Reggie, died at 66, in 2000, a few weeks after being allowed out on compassionate leave. Film industry executives have shown great interest in the film about the Krays, with buyers hailing the script as 'one of the best' they'd come across. The Krays' story was previously told in the 1990 British film, The Krays, with real life brothers Martin and Gary Kemp playing the title roles.","The Krays ran a terrifying network of organised crime in the 1950s and 60s .

"By . Harriet Arkell . An ancient spring which laid the foundations for the historic town of Royal Tunbridge Wells has dried up for what is believed to the first time in its 400-year history. The discovery of the iron-rich waters of the Chalybeate Spring in 1606 prompted the building of the spa town as people flocked in search of its supposed health-giving properties. But this summer, 408 years after Dudley Lord North drank from the spring and found his hangover cured, the waters have stopped flowing beneath the town's historic Pantiles area. Run out? The famous Chalybeate Spring in Tunbridge Wells has been closed to visitors after it ran dry . Tourist attraction: The 'dippers' in period dress who serve the water noticed water levels were low in May . Tunbridge Wells began in the 17th century after a nobleman tasted the waters that seeped from the ground . In May, the Tunbridge Wells 'dippers' in period costume who serve up the orange waters to thirst visitors for £1 a time noticed that it was becoming harder to fill their cups. But this week, town hall bosses had to admit defeat and close the Chaleybeate Spring to tourists as there was no longer any water to serve. While the water levels flowed slowly in 2011/2012, this is the first time the waters have stopped flowing at all at the spring under the Pantiles. A spokesman for Tunbridge Wells Borough Council said: 'We don't know what has caused the water to stop.  It can't be right to say the spring itself has dried up, given all the rain we've had, but it has stopped flowing under the Pantiles. 'We have had to close the dipper service as a result, but hopefully it will return soon.' The Pantiles spring is usually open five days a week from May to September every year. Targetfollow, the property investment firm that owns the Pantiles, said they were looking into why the water had run dry. Historic: The Bath House and Chalybeate Spring are in the Pantiles area, known for its Georgian colonnades . Now the historic spa town's residents are worried about the impact on tourism, which provides 30 per cent of Tunbridge Wells' income. Resident Richard Loft, 46, said: 'What is a spa town with no spring?' The spa town, known for its conservative, 'disgusted' residents, was built around the Chalybeate Spring in the early 1600s after the nobleman noticed the orangey-brown waters seeping from the ground and tasted them. He instantly declared the waters a cure for hangovers, obesity and a 'moist brain', and recommended the area to friends and noblemen in London. By the time Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I, visited in 1630, it had established itself as a spa retreat, with visitors flocking from London and elsewhere in the country. The Chalybeate (pronounced Ka Lee Be At) Spring was discovered by Dudley Lord North 408 years ago . By the 1700s, a visit to the spring at Tunbridge Wells had become an essential part of any well-to-do resident or visitor's day. The town's tourist website reports: 'The day started with a glass of spring water, followed by a promenade on 'The Walks' or a visit to the coffee house for the latest gossip, then off to church at the nearby Chapel of Ease, King Charles the Martyr. 'The afternoon was spent with more promenading, gambling, or a friendly match on one of the nearby bowling greens, and finished with further gambling, dancing or a musical soiree or grand ball in the evening.' Historians say the Chalybeate water was served by a 'Dipper' for a small charge which covered not the water itself but the service of it being handed to the drinker. Tunbridge Wells enjoyed huge popularity with the royal family in the 1800s, with visits from the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and in 1909 King Edward VII granted the town its 'Royal' status in honour of this. In 2010 tourists were banned from drinking the spring water after harmful bacteria were found in it, and the following year the spring was closed temporarily when water levels dropped, but this is the first time that the spring is thought to have dried up completely.","Orange, iron-rich waters of the Chalybeate spring were discovered in 1606 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A mother who took her children to a controversial church in which the minister held naked rituals with followers and engaged in oral sex lost her battle to maintain custody after an appeals court upheld another judge's ruling. The court concluded that the father was rightfully given custody of the children, according to the ruling, which was issued Wednesday. The custody case focused on the woman's involvement in Light of the World Ministries, whose pastor, Philip Livingston, used what he called 'light therapy' to treat his congregants. An image taken from Google Street View showing the Light of the World Ministries church building in Illinois . The ritual evolved to the point Livingston's female followers got naked in the back room of a small house overlooking a lake in Wauconda. In one-on-one sessions, Livingston would get naked, insert his fingers in their private areas and told them to touch his, according to the Chicago Tribune, which in 2011 conducted an investigation into the church. Livingston claimed in court testimony that the 'spiritual guidance' helped cure everything from drug additions to yeast infections, the paper reported. The mother in the custody case testified that she participated in the ritual. Philip Livingston, pictured in this 2007 photo, testified in court that he repeatedly performed a naked ritual with his congregants, claiming it helped cure everything from drug addictions to yeast infections. He said it was done only with consenting adults who were members of his donor-funded Light of the World Ministries . The children's involvement in the ritual was the crux of the custody case. A former follower testified that she saw the mother and two of her female children, then aged 13 and 10, naked in Livingston's home, and that he asked her to groom one of the children for the ritual. Livingston, the mother and others insisted only consenting adults were involved. A criminal investigation was launched, but no charges were filed, the Tribune reported. A Kane County judge in TK said Livingston was not believable. He gave custody of the children to the father after ruling that the evidence suggested 'knowing and reckless conduct which creates an immediate risk of physical harm' to them. Cook County prosecutors later moved to make the children wards of the state in a process that cemented the father's custody of the children while requiring they be kept away from the church and its members. The mother appealed, arguing the case wasn't handled fairly and that her religious freedom was violated. The three-judge appellate panel disagreed. 'When a parent puts his/her children in a social setting with naked adults, and encourages his (or her) daughter to receive therapy from a man who sometimes, in the course of therapy, digitally penetrates the vaginas of the recipients of his therapy, the evidence sufficiently supports a finding that the parent exposed his/her children to an injurious environment,' according to the synopsis published by the First District Appellate Court.","Appeals court rules father was rightfully given custody of children because of mother's role in Illinois church .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Retired vicar Brian Spence, 74, of Hook, Hampshire, was jailed for four years today after being convicted of seven counts of indecent assault on young girls . A former vicar who preyed on young girls and abused them in the church between weddings was jailed today after being convicted of a series of sex attacks. Brian Spence, 74, was accused of putting his hands down girls' shorts, kissing them on the lips and groping their breasts when he was the vicar at St John the Baptist church in Crowthorne, Berkshire. The four girls, aged as young as ten when the incidents took place in the 1990s, told how they were left scared to go back into the church or be alone with the married vicar. Today he was jailed for four years at Reading Crown Court after a jury found him guilty of seven counts of indecent assault. Judge Nicholas Wood told Spence, now of Hook, Hampshire: 'You used and abused and exploited the trust placed in you to indecently assault four girls. 'You had, in the 90s, an unhealthy sexual interest in children.' During the trial, prosecutor Elisabeth Bussey-Jones said Spence was the 'trusted and respected' church vicar when the attacks took place between 1994 and 1998. She said Spence attacked one of the girls in July 1995 at the church when she was 11, while another woman claimed she was assaulted by Spence at a weekend retreat designed to prepare her for communion classes. A third girl was said to have been assaulted by Spence three times when she was 14 or 15. The fourth woman claimed Spence put his hand on her knee under the table at a confirmation class when she was 11 or 12. Each of the women eventually mentioned the incidents to members of their family or former boyfriends, the court heard. When he took the stand, Spence told the jury he was 'a bit of an ostrich' who 'hoped it would all go away' when one of the alleged victims first made accusations against him via email seven years ago. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wrote: 'How would you like it if your wife and daughter knew the things you did to us?' Spence told the jury he deleted the email and said he didn’t hear from the woman again until he was arrested by police last year. Ms Bussey-Jones asked him why, adding: . 'If you received an email like that and you were an innocent man, you . would have shared that concern with your wife and with the church . authorities, and bottomed out that matter straight away to put it to . bed.' Reading Crown Court heard that Spence was sent an email in 2007 from a woman claiming he assaulted her . He replied: 'Not necessarily...I’m afraid I’m a bit of an ostrich. All I knew is I didn’t do it. 'She had made that allegation and I wondered if anything would happen from it, and nothing did until many years later. 'From my point of view, it’s not true, and I don’t know why they are saying it.' He told the jury he would hug the children and put them on his knee 'in those days,' but denied being a paedophile. Spence, who was more recently priest-in-charge at St Mark’s Church in Englefield, Berkshiure, before he retired, denied nine charges of indecent assault. He was convicted of seven of them but jurors could not reach a decision on the other two, so the judge ordered that they lie on file. He was jailed for four years and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register.","Brian Spence, 74, was vicar at St John the Baptist church in Crowthorne .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A photographer whose unforgettable image of a crowd of people watching in horror as the World Trade Center burned is trying to locate his subjects. Patrick Witty was on the scene in Manhattan’s Financial District 12 years ago and the image he caught has since been published dozens of times worldwide. Since starting his quest on September 11 last year, Witty has identified two of the people in his iconic photo, but he’s nowhere near finished. Engaging: Twelve years later, Patrick Witty, the man who snapped this iconic photo of horrified onlookers in Lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001, wants to meet his subjects . ‘I want to know them all,’ Witty wrote on Time.com’s Lightbox blog. The photographer is now the international photo editor for Time magazine. On September 11, 2001, he was a freelance photographer living in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. ‘I heard screaming on the roof of my building, and went up and saw the World Trade Center on fire,’ Witty told Yahoo News. ‘When the second plane hit, I grabbed my camera gear and went down there.’ Witty stayed and took photos of the ash-covered aftermath until the police kicked him out. Found: Benjamin Tabile is pictured here with unidentified family. He is one of the two subjects of Witty's photo who've come forward since the photographer began searching for names to put with the faces . What they saw: Witty's subjects were looking up just as the South Tower began to collapse . But it is just one of his pictures that has become a part of the nation’s collective consciousness, a photo he calls ‘a cross-section of New Yorkers, united in terror, standing at Park Row and Beekman Street in lower Manhattan.’ Last year, Witty posted his photo on Facebook and Twitter in the hopes of contacting each and every person he captured on film that day. ‘After it was shared more than 10,000 times,’ he said. ‘I now know two of them.’ One of those people is Benjamin Tabile. Witty was contacted by Tabile’s son Edward after he posted his photo on September 11 last year. Tabile is the man at the center of the photograph wearing glasses. He looks more shocked than the others, and with good reason. He was on his way to the World Trade Center that day for a job interview, but was running late. ‘As I walked out of the subway, I saw the building on fire and didn’t know why,’ he told Time. ‘I was in complete shock. I would have been in that building while the planes hit.’ Witty believes there are other stories like that contained in his photo and he wants to hear them. He urges anyone who recognizes someone in the photo to reach him at patrick_witty@timemagazine.com. He’s also on Twitter @patrickwitty.","Patrick Witty's photo of people staring up as the South Tower began to crumble has been republished dozens of times worldwide .

"By . Lauren Libbert . At 8.30am on a Saturday, you would expect to find most children in front of the TV with a bowl of cornflakes, or in bed. Instead, 12-year-old Hannah Whiterow is dashing up a sizeable hill in Highgate Wood, North London, being timed with a stopwatch by her personal trainer. She has already done an arduous mini-circuit, involving push-ups, squats, lunges, knee-lifts and some serious grappling with a TRX suspension training device hooked to a trees to build up her core strength. In training: Hilary Burbridge with Hannah, left, and Mariana, both 12 . By the end, Hannah, who is 5 ft 5 in and weighs a trim 8 stone 2 lbs, is sweaty and exhausted. Her mother, Rosie Whiterow, 48, is thrilled. This is because trainer Hilary Burbridge has managed what Rosie has been failing to do for some time: coax her daughter off the sofa and into a pair of running shoes. 'Hannah does an hour of PE a week at school and was at the age when she wasn't interested in going to the playground,' says Rosie. 'Instead, she wants to listen to music, talk to friends on her phone, or watch TV. I was worried about her becoming a couch potato. She wasn't overweight, but I was concerned she wasn't moving.' Hannah is typical of this generation of children who, this week, were called 'the least active generation in history' by 2012 Olympic organiser, Lord Sebastian Coe. This was on the back of a new parliamentary report, which found half of children aged seven don't exercise enough, and will live shorter lives as a result. While Coe is calling for 'breakfast fitness clubs', so pupils exercise before the day starts, mothers like Rosie are outsourcing the problem, paying up to £200 a month to enlist a personal trainer. Instead of turning off the TV and organising a trip to the park, the modern solution for time-stretched parents is to employ someone to do their nagging for them. Rosie, who works full-time in publishing, heard about Hilary through other parents and signed Hannah up for the classes. 'I wanted to encourage her to stay fit and healthy, but in a positive way, rather than telling her constantly that she'd be fat if she kept eating biscuits,' says Rosie. 'Hilary's sessions seemed perfect. Some Saturdays, Hannah is reluctant, but when she gets going, she loves it. She's been having sessions once a week for 18 months and is incredibly fit. On a recent break to Devon I was in awe of how she climbed a steep hill without getting out of breath. 'It's inspired Hannah to take responsibility for her health. She's now walking part of her way to school, instead of taking the bus.' Workout: Sean with nine-year-old James and ten-year-old Lucy . With the report claiming just half of seven-year-olds meet government recommendations of an hour's moderate to vigorous physical activity a day, with activity levels halving again between ages nine and 15, it's little wonder middle-class parents like Rosie are turning to experts. Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that 28 per cent of children aged two to 15 are obese, and increasing reliance on iPods, iPads and mobiles for entertainment is a big contributing factor. Worrying projections suggest that, without effective intervention, six out of ten children will be dangerously overweight by 2050. Hilary, 52, has about 20 children on her books, most around Hannah's age or younger, each paying £5 for an hour-long session. She qualified as a trainer three years ago, after a career as a business development consultant. As a mum to a ten-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter, she saw the need for her services. 'State schools don't have the resources to do a lot of sport, so parents are looking for alternatives,' says Hilary. 'The children may moan at the start, especially if it's cold or raining, but they're with friends, and end up having a laugh. There's a real sense of achievement at the end.' Natacha Osorio, 51, from London, hired Hilary in response to 12-year-old daughter Mariana's sedentary lifestyle. Her son, Pablo, 14, plays a lot of sport, but finding a sport Mariana enjoyed was more tricky. 'She refuses to walk to school and I worried about how little exercise she was doing,' says Natacha. 'When we went shopping, she'd lag behind and I'd have to nag her to keep up.' Mariana, who is 5 ft 2 in and weighs 7 stone 7lb, says her enjoyment of the sessions depends on her mood, but she loves the hill dash 'as it's made my legs so much stronger'. Isn't enlisting a personal trainer just another way for harried parents to palm responsibility off to hired help? What happened to a family game of rounders in the park? Hilary worries about this, too. 'So much of how children progress is to do with parents' influence. They have to project the right image and be active,' she says. 'But parents are living high-pressure lives and feel guilty about not doing as much exercise with their family as they'd like. That's where I step in.' Trainer Hilary Burbridge (centre of both images) has managed what . Rosie has been failing to do for some time: coax children daughter off the . sofa and into a pair of running shoes (Pictured: Hannah, left, and Mariana, both 12) Across the UK, CrossFit - which offers high intensity strength and conditioning circuit classes for adults - has spawned a junior version, CrossFit Kids, which is attracting parents in droves. Sarah Dawes-Clark, 40, a manager from Cardiff, has been sending her son James, nine, and daughter Lucy, ten, to Sean Allen's CrossFit Kids classes once a week for the past six months, paying £5 a time, and has hired Sean to top Lucy up with an extra weekly one-on-one session, at £30 an hour. 'I probably spend around £200 a month on their fitness,' says Sarah. 'It's worth it as it is setting them up with skills to keep healthy for life.' Sarah, a fit size six, and husband Andrew are into CrossFit themselves, and do five classes a week. 'James and Lucy were only doing two PE sessions a week at school. Even then, it was the first class to be dumped if they had a special assignment or presentation,' says Sarah. In a normal 45-minute session, Sean, 31, does squats, deadlifts, press-ups, sit-ups and box-jumps, all of which are scaled, according to a child's weight and ability. A former primary school teacher, he earns about £210 a week from his young clientele, seeing about five children one-to-one, and running a weekly CrossFit Kids and Teens class, with ten to 12 children in each. And the interest is growing. 'Teenage girls are often sent to me because they've put on a bit of weight and want to lose it,' says Sean. 'One young client was thrilled because she dropped a dress size. 'When they first come, they struggle to hold a squat for more than 30 seconds. As the weeks go on, they can hold the positions for longer.' The problem, according to Sean, is that schools are geared towards traditional or competitive sports, and some children lose interest. Since going to his sessions, Sean has seen a big change in Lucy. ‘She's a quiet girl, but when we do the session, she comes alive,' he says. Sarah agrees: 'Lucy, who is 4 ft 5 in and weighs 5 stone 1 lb, is always buzzing after her sessions, telling me how many pull-ups or box-jumps she did, and how much stronger and more confident she feels.' All this after-school activity does eat away at Sarah's time with her children. 'I have to fight the guilt,' she says. 'I worry we're not spending as much time as a family, or one-to-one, as I'd like. But then, I see how much the children benefit.' Adrian Voce, campaigner and former director of Play England, which campaigns for greater provision of childhood play, is less enthusiastic. 'This seems a sad indictment of the modern world,' he says. 'Given the freedom to play outdoors, children will get the physical exercise they need. Children of all ages should be able to play out near their homes naturally. Parents shouldn't have to resort to paying to get their kids to exercise.'","Hilary Burbridge trains a number of youngsters in North London .

"By . Lauren Libbert . Like a child in a sweet shop, my eyes goggled at the array of inviting colours. Should I go for pillar box red, tangerine orange or deep plum? As I tested each shade out in front of the shop mirror, pouting and stretching my mouth into one teeth-baring smile after another, I noticed the assistant giving me strange looks. But I didn’t care. She wasn’t to know what a momentous occasion this was. For the best part of 20 years, I had worn lipstick on only a handful of occasions. Smiling again: Lauren aged nine (left), and now, after 15 months of wearing braces . Smiling and wearing lipstick, you see, would only draw attention to the part of my face that I hated: my teeth. With a crooked front pair that jutted forward and overlapped and big gaping holes at the sides, I preferred to keep my mouth shut. But now, at 43, after wearing fixed train-track braces for 15 long months, I finally have a smile to flaunt. At a cost of £4500, my overbite has been hoiked back, my front teeth uncrossed and straightened, and four gaping holes, where teeth were misguidedly taken out as a teenager, closed. The results are not perfect. According to my specialist orthodontist, Dr Erika Ruiz-Mealin at Bhuva Dental Care in London, only corrective jaw surgery — breaking, moving and rewiring the supporting bones — could give me a full-on Hollywood smile. Beaming: Lauren after having her braces removed and feeling much happier . But I am not complaining. As well as buying three new lipsticks, I have been flashing my new smile at every opportunity as I lay to rest the ghosts of a protruding set of gnashers that has tarnished some of my happiest moments. My primary school nicknames included Bugs Bunny, Goofy and Fraggle (after the puppets in the cartoon Fraggle Rock) and at 13, my teeth were awful enough to earn me free treatment on the NHS. I had train-track braces for two years, wisdom teeth removed, an overnight head brace, more teeth out and even surgery to remove my frenulum, the string of tissue under my top lip. Frankly, I think my orthodontist was at his wits’ end because even he couldn’t understand why, by the age of 16, my teeth didn’t look remarkably different from when the treatment began. Not a vain person, I learned to live with my less-than-perfect teeth and perfected a small, tight smile for the camera. Before: Not a vain person, I learned to live with my less-than-perfect teeth and perfected a small, tight smile for the camera. After: I now have a thin wire fixed behind my teeth to keep them in place and a set of clear retainers which look like gum shields to wear every night for the rest of my life. It's a small price to pay for a perfect smile. It was there in the pictures of my 30th birthday party which I co-hosted in a cool basement bar in Central London with my very attractive friend, Samantha. We were both tipsy and while she wrapped an arm around me and beamed, I looked stiff and po-faced, as if I couldn’t wait to leave. Concerns about my looks inevitably had an impact on my confidence when it came to the opposite sex.  And, I couldn’t help but wonder whether my snaggle teeth were the reason I was still single when so many of my friends were being snapped up. But at 31 I met Colin, who thought my buck teeth quirky and cute. Nonetheless, that same tight smile was there on the happiest day of my life — our wedding day in December 2005. The photographer kept saying, ‘Give us a nice, big smile please, Lauren’ and, ‘Bit bigger?’ then, ‘More happy?’ I was happy. Very happy. I just didn’t want to show my teeth. Tight-lipped: Until Lauren got her teeth fixed, she hated showing her teeth in photos. 'Even now, I look back at those pictures . and don’t see the beautiful antique dress or the lovely husband beside . me. Instead, I hone in on the big front tooth resting on my lower lip.' Pictured: aged 12, left. At her graduation, right. Even now, I look back at those pictures and don’t see the beautiful antique dress or the lovely husband beside me. Instead, I hone in on the big front tooth resting on my lower lip. It bothered me so much that when I became the editor of Top Sante magazine at 37 and had to have my picture taken for the Editor’s letter page, I insisted my teeth were digitally retouched to give me a beautiful, even smile. I was particularly self-conscious when I had to meet new advertising clients or give presentations to large groups of people. By the time my 40th birthday came round, I was starting to feel the dissatisfaction more acutely. The overlap of my two front teeth seemed to be getting worse and there was now a dark yellow staining between them where my toothbrush could no longer reach. I started to do my research. During treatment: I opted for the more subtle porcelain white variety of train track. The treatment was arduous; my teeth were often tender and my mouth full of ulcers and grazes where the tracks rubbed against my gums. According to the British Orthodontic Society, adults were now making up half of the patients in some practices and enquiries for adult braces were up 135 per cent since 2011. After discussing it with Colin and my family, who understood the extent of my unhappiness, I decided to have a consultation. Dr Erika explained she could improve my smile dramatically by fixing metal braces to the front of my upper and lower teeth for up to 18 months. I would have to visit her every four to six weeks to have them tightened — with thicker wires and elastic bands — and I would experience some discomfort along the way. I didn’t hesitate. I opted for the more subtle porcelain white variety of train track. The treatment was arduous — my teeth were often tender and my mouth full of ulcers and grazes where the tracks rubbed against my gums. I couldn’t bite into hard foods and my cleaning routine — with interdental brushes and mouthwash and rigorous brushing — kept me in the bathroom for a good half hour each night. Friends only noticed the braces when I pointed them out, and were very curious, some even contemplating work themselves. I now have a thin wire fixed behind my teeth to keep them in place and a set of clear retainers which look like gum shields to wear every night for the rest of my life. It’s a small price to pay for a perfect smile.","School nicknames included Bugs .

"By . Lauren Libbert . Forget how many years you’ve clocked up — experts say what really matters when it comes to how good you look and feel is your ‘biological age’. This is the physiological age of the internal systems that keep your body functioning healthily and looking good — from your kidneys, brain and nervous tissue through to your skin. One of the best markers of this is the level of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) in your body. AGEs are harmful compounds that are formed by glycation: a chemical reaction that happens naturally as we age, but can be accelerated by poor lifestyle choices. How healthy are you?: If you are guilty of not getting enough exercise, smoking, having high stress levels, a poor diet and not getting enough sleep, you could have a biological age that is much higher than your real one as you may have damaged your internal systems . These AGEs trigger an inflammatory response, causing tissue damage and premature ageing, as well as contributing to the development of age-related diseases such as diabetes, vision impairment, heart disease and kidney damage. As we revealed in our definitive sugar series with Brooke Alpert earlier this year, your dietary intake of sugar affects the speed at which glycation happens — and therefore the rate at which AGEs are produced. The more sugar you consume, the more AGEs are generated. But it’s not only sugar that takes its toll. Dr Nessar Ahmed, reader in clinical biochemistry at the School Of Healthcare Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, explains: ‘Foods cooked at high temperatures with direct heat, such as grilling and frying, where caramelisation occurs, increase the production of AGEs.’ Other contributing factors include lack of exercise, smoking, high stress levels, poor diet and not getting enough sleep. Previously, the only means of measuring your AGEs was through an invasive skin biopsy. But a new, clinically proven scanner called TruAge can measure the levels in your skin — a good indicator of the level of AGEs throughout the rest of your body — in 20 seconds, to give an instant picture of your inner state of health. The higher your level, the ‘older’ you are — both inside and out. We asked three women to discover their inner age, before Melinda Lane, an expert from Morinda, the company behind the scanner, analysed their surprising results . . . Gemma Carey, a freelance fashion assistant, lives in Finsbury Park, London.  Real age, 19. Inner age, 44 . Gemma Carey: Real age 19, inner age 44. Her love for chocolate and steak and no time to go to the gym has seen her rise from a size ten to a size 12 . I left my parents’ home in Bristol last October and moved in with a friend in London. Most nights I’ll have a stir-fry or make burgers or fry chicken with oven chips. I eat out once a week: my favourite meal is steak and chips. I don’t eat breakfast, but I have a cereal bar later in the morning and a tuna sandwich with crisps for lunch. I love fruit and vegetables, and get my five a day. My big weakness is chocolate, especially Galaxy bars, and I can eat up to three a week. I drink quite a lot of juice, too, particularly orange juice and Ribena. I used to be a size ten, but now I’m a size 12. A lot of this is due to stress — I’ve just left my previous job and looking for new work is tough. I feel insecure and everything is up in the air. When I lived in Bristol, I used to go to the gym three times a week, but I’ve been too busy and feel very sluggish as a result. MELINDA’S VERDICT: Gemma’s score is quite bad, but this is often the case with young people when they’re living fast and not thinking much about the consequences. She has plenty of time to get her diet right and balance her AGE levels out. She eats a lot of fried, seared food, so even baking or steaming some of her evening meals would help. The higher the temperature food is cooked at, the more chemical reactions between sugar and protein will occur, forming more AGEs. Swapping juice for water would be good, too: juice has a high sugar content, and sugar is the enemy. It’s also thought high stress levels can contribute to a spike in AGEs as when we are anxious our blood sugar levels can rise, speeding up the glycation process. Suzanne Seddon, an acting teacher and scriptwriter, lives in Islington, London, with daughter Poppy-Willow, eight.  Real age, 45. Inner age, 57 . Susanne Seddon: Real age 45, inner age 57. Although she is a smoker who has the odd glass of wine, Susanne has recently started eating healthier . I’ve smoked 20 cigarettes a day for more than 20 years. I’ve tried to stop several times and once managed it for nine months, but I can’t seem to kick the habit for good. I love a glass of wine with my evening meal and find it’s a great way to relax after a hard day. I drink more at weekends when I’m with friends — maybe up to half a bottle of wine in one evening. Otherwise, I’m quite health-conscious. I’ve been trying to lose weight as I was getting heavier round the middle and had put on nearly two stone over the past year, going from a dress size 12 to 14. I’ve been cutting back on carbohydrates and eating low-fat versions of everything from yogurt to soup. In the evenings, I’ll try to cook a healthy meal for me and my daughter: a roast chicken with buttered cabbage, or fish with potato and green beans. Poppy-Willow and I go swimming once a week and I walk my dog, Leo, three times a day, too. On the downside, I’m a sun-worshipper, and I was a flight attendant for eight years on the Caribbean-American routes, so my skin has been damaged and I’m more wrinkled and dry as a result, with age spots and pigmentation. MELINDA’S VERDICT: The main contributing factors to Suzanne’s high score are the amount she smokes and drinks. Cigarette smoke contains a substance called nornicotine (derived from nicotine), which is inhaled into the lungs and passes into the blood stream. Nornicotine reacts with proteins in the body to produce AGEs, and studies have found smokers have far higher levels than non-smokers. It would be ideal if she could stop smoking completely, but even cutting the smoking and drinking by half could improve her looks and health in weeks. Vanessa Powell, a receptionist, has two daughters, Jessica, ten, and Violet, eight. She lives with husband Stacy in Coulsdon, Surrey. Real age, 44. Inner age, 41 . Vanessa Powell: Real age 44, inner age 41. After noticing how much wine her husband and her were consuming, Vanessa has cut back and started exercising several times a week . Towards the end of last year, my husband and I were getting through a whole bottle of wine a night. It was our way of winding down after a stressful day. I work six days a week, from 8.30am to 2pm, and during the week I’d be rushing from one after-school club to another with the girls. By the time I’d got home and prepared a quick meal, I was exhausted. Dinner-wise, I’m a fan of anything quick — pasta with sauce or ready meals I can pop in the oven, and I’ll steam some vegetables to go with my meal. I noticed I’ve been getting fatter, so last month I gave up alcohol and started exercising. I go swimming once a week, and I do a legs, bums and tums class, too. I eat three meals a day, with cereal for breakfast, and a sandwich or cup of soup for lunch. I definitely feel and look better than I did four weeks ago. MELINDA’S VERDICT: Vanessa has done really well. To lower her AGE levels further she needs to cut back on processed food and try to cook a proper meal at least a couple of nights a week. Her new-found abstinence will have reduced her AGE level, as well. Alcohol contains large amounts of sugar. The exercise will have helped, too, as it burns up excess sugar in the body for fuel, so lowering blood sugar and, therefore, AGE levels.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Troubled actor Philip Seymour Hoffman had found himself in a love triangle not long before his drug overdose death, it was revealed today. Writing in his private diaries, the 46-year-old Hollywood star talked about feeling 'caught in between' long-time girlfriend Mimi O'Donnell and another woman he had recently met. Hoffman's journal entries suggested that his relationship with his unidentified new paramour may have triggered his split from O’Donnell, who asked him to move out of their Manhattan home three months before his death. Love triangle: In his diaries, the late actor talked about feeling 'caught in between' his longtime girlfriend Mimi O'Donnell (right) and another woman he had met not long before his death . Law enforcement sources told The New York Post's Page Six that O'Donnell did not want Hoffman around their three young children while he was using drugs. In his often incoherent 'secret diaries,' Hoffman had described being troubled by 'demons,' wrote about drug deals, and his struggle to overcome his addiction with Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Some of the entries appear to have been written while in rehab for heroin abuse, while others are scrambled and illegible, with sentences running into each other as though he was high when he put pen to paper. According to NBC News, New York City police who searched the actor's West Village apartment after he was found dead February 2 discovered two small diaries, one measuring about 6 by 8 inches and another approximately 7 by 9 inches. Diaries: Philip Seymour Hoffman, pictured at Sundance in January, had described being troubled by 'demons' in his private journal in the months before his death, it emerged Tuesday . Drug deals: In the diaries, the late actor, pictured with his two daughters Tallulah and Willa, wrote about drug deals, and his struggle to overcome his addiction with Narcotics Anonymous meetings . The network's sources said the hand-scrawled contents often start off clearly and end up impossible to read. They referenced buying drugs and his battle with his 'demons.' The Oscar-winning actor also reportedly said he felt 'ashamed that he was going out and hanging out and drinking' after being clean for two decades. 'It's stream of consciousness and difficult to follow,' one source said. 'In one line he refers to ""Frank who always owes money"" and on the same page he writes about a 15-year-old girl from Texas.' Another source told NBC: 'It seems he did at least part of it in rehab. It definitely contained some soul-searching. But there is also a fair amount of rambling that doesn't make sense.' Hoffman entered rehab for at least 10 days in 2013, admitting that his use of prescription drugs had escalated to heroin. News of the diaries comes after a drug dealer charged in connection with the beloved character actor's tragic death claimed he could have saved his life. In a jailhouse interview on Rikers Island, Robert Vineberg, a jazz musician and fellow junkie, denied selling Hoffman the drugs that killed him, insisting he hadn't seen the star since October or even heard from him since December. Tragic: The actor is seen in January 2013 with his son, Cooper, enjoying the basketball . Apartment: New York City police who searched the actor's West Village apartment, pictured, after he was found dead February 2 discovered two small diaries, one measuring about 6 by 8 inches and another approximately 7 by 9 inches . 'I could've saved him,' Vineberg told The New York Post. 'If I knew he was in town, I would've said, ""Hey, let's make an AA meeting."" If I was with him, it wouldn't have happened. Not under my guard.' Vineberg said he had known Hoffman for about a year and the pair were friends, getting together to talk about books and art. 'He was a normal guy. You wouldn’t know he was an Oscar winner,' he said. But he said the actor was a 'hardcore addict' with a 10 bag-a-day heroin habit. The performer, who has worked with . Madonna, Wyclef Jean and the late Amy Winehouse, said he last saw . Hoffman in October, when the actor was high at his Mott Street . apartment, where police arrested him last week. After that, things seemed to be looking up for the actor. He went on a 28-day rehab stint before flying to Atlanta to shoot the upcoming 'Hunger Games' movie. Funeral: Philip Seymour Hoffman was laid to rest February 6 at St. Ignatius of Loyola Church in New York . Sad: Mimi O'Donnell, center, comforted her daughter Tallulah, along with daughter Willa, left, and son Cooper, at the emotional ceremony . 'He left me a voicemail in December saying, ""I'm clean,""' he said of their final contact. Hoffman . was found dead in his bathroom a week ago with 73 bags of heroin . scattered around his West Village apartment. He still had a syringe in . his arm, it was reported. But . Vineberg, 57, denied supplying him with the drugs that killed him. When . The Post asked if he had ever sold Hoffman drugs, he refused to answer. He said he was 'devastated' by Hoffman's death and offered his condolences to his family. He suggested his brief stint off the drugs may have made him more susceptible to overdose. 'When . you're clean for that long of a time, your body can't take as much,' Vineberg said. 'Your body doesn't have the tolerance.' He added: 'He was a hard-core addict.' He is convinced that Hoffman was injecting 10 bags a day. 'How much was he found with? Seventy bags. You do the math . . . That's a one-week supply,' he said. Serious habit: Hoffman, pictured in healthier days, entered rehab for at least 10 days in 2013, admitting that his use of prescription drugs had escalated to heroin . Charged: Robert Aaron Vineberg, pictured in court on February 5, has claimed he could have saved Philip Seymour Hoffman, who he said had a 10 bag-a-day heroin habit . NYPD sources told the Post the estimate - about twice that of an average junkie - was about right. Vineberg was also a drug user and the pair battled with their addiction together, he said. Vineberg managed to stay clean for a week at a time between relapses and said he and Hoffman would text back and forth, to keep one another on the straight and narrow. But they fell out of touch late last year. Vineberg was charged with felony drug possession and was one of three people dealers charged in connection with Hoffman's death. A young couple who lived nextdoor to Vineberg's Mott Street apartment, where cops seized some 300 bags of heroin, were charged with misdemeanor cocaine possession. Wearing a gray prison jumpsuit, Vineberg told The Post he's 'a scapegoat' in the case. His attorney insists there is no evidence to suggest Vineberg supplied Hoffman with the deadly narcotics and claims the pair 'were true friends who had bonded over and struggled with the dangerous use of narcotic drugs.'","New York City police who searched the actor's West Village apartment after he was found dead February 2 discovered two small diaries .

"By . Dan Bloom . A baker who lost a discrimination case for turning away a gay couple has revealed he will stop making wedding cakes completely. Jack Phillips, 57, refused to bake a wedding cake for Denver residents David Mullins, 29, and Charlie Craig, 34 - despite it being claimed he was happy to make one for two dogs. The couple sued him and won in a landmark case, which saw the Colorado Civil Rights Commission unanimously declare free speech and business should be separate. Rising anger: Baker Jack Phillips, from Denver, Colorado, said he will stop baking wedding cakes completely after a landmark ruling declared he was wrong to refuse an order from a gay couple on the grounds of belief . Court battle: Charlie Craig, 34 (left) and his husband David Mullins, 29 (right) have fought the decision for almost two years after the American Civil Liberties Union took up their case. Mr Mullins said he was 'thrilled' Now Mr Phillips has revealed he will stop baking wedding cakes altogether so he will not be 'forced to participate' in a same-sex ceremony. He told CBS 4 Denver: 'We would close down the bakery before we would complicate our beliefs. 'If it's just a birthday, I have no problem with that. My issue is that I don't want to be forced to participate in a same-sex wedding'. But the Masterpiece Cakeshop, which also employs his sister and 87-year-old mother, is unlikely to go out of business. He claimed had been so . overwhelmed by supporters eager to buy cookies and brownies that he does . not need to make wedding cakes any more. It has been illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation since 2008 in Colorado, which legalised same-sex 'beneficiary agreements' the following year. Last year the state legalised same-sex civil unions. However, gay marriage remains illegal in Colorado and the couple's ceremony in September 2012 was held in Massachusetts, followed by the reception at their Denver home. Loving: The couple at their home in Denver, Colorado, where they had the reception. Gay marriage is still illegal in Colorado so they had to hold the ceremony itself in Massachusetts, where it was legalised in 2004 . Home life: The couple playing cards. In the ruling, Colorado Civil Rights Commissioner Raju Jaram said: 'I can believe anything I want, but if I'm going to do business here, I'd ought to not discriminate against people' Ordinary: The couple said they never intended to become the focus of a global campaign, but were just angry . The panel this week ordered Phillips to stop discriminating against gay people and to report . quarterly for two years on staff anti-discrimination training and any . customers he refuses to serve. Commissioner Raju Jaram said: 'I can believe . anything I want, but if I'm going to do business here, I'd ought to not . discriminate against people.' Mr Mullins said he was 'thrilled'. 'The next time a gay couple wanders in there asking for a wedding cake, they won’t have the experience we had,' he said. 'They will have a responsible experience and leave feeling respected.' The Christian baker has said he may appeal the ruling. This commission's decision confirmed a lower court's finding in December that Phillips had violated . civil rights law. It was the end of a two-year battle which began after a furious Mr Mullins wrote a report of his encounter on Facebook. Support: The baker said he had been inundated with people wanting to buy cupcakes and brownies from him . Christian Mr Phillips had refused service to gay couples before because he claimed it was against the Bible . The baker said: 'In everything I do, I think about how people will perceive Christ through me, by what I sell' 'Today, Charlie and I went to cake shop to get a wedding cake and were turned away and informed they did not serve gay weddings,' he wrote. 'I AM FURIOUS! But, I'm also not going to take this lying down.' He posted the address and phone number of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Denver, Colorado, on Facebook and the reaction soon spiralled into a full-blown campaign. Ceremony: The couple wed in 2012. The 'equals' symbol stands for equal marriage . Mr Mullins and Mr Craig campaigned outside the shop with placards declaring 'Let them eat cake' and it was inundated with phone calls. The couple said they never intended to become the focus of a global campaign, but were just angry. The baker had insisted after the encounter, which lasted less than a minute, that he was just sticking to his Christian beliefs. But the American Civil Liberties Union - which took the case to court - then claimed a lesbian couple found out Mr Phillips was happy to bake a wedding cake for two dogs. An ACLU spokesman said: 'They wanted to order some cupcakes to celebrate their commitment ceremony... but the store refused to take their order, informing the couple that they have a strict policy against selling cakes for same-sex weddings and ceremonies. 'Then Stephanie tried a little experiment. She called the bakery and told the owner, Jack Phillips, that she was planning to host a wedding celebration for two dogs. 'She told him that the dog wedding cake would need to feed 20 people and should be decorated with the names ""Roscoe"" and ""Buffy."" 'Without hesitation, Phillips quoted her a price and asked how soon she needed it.' The incident was one of several which inspired legislation in at least 11 states that would have allowed business owners to cite their religious beliefs in denying service to patrons. Most of the proposed laws, however, were knocked dead amid a national outcry that they would legalise discrimination. Mr Phillips previously said he loved his work because it improves people's lives, and 'that's what Christ does'. He added: 'In everything I do, I think about how . people will perceive Christ through me, by what I sell, what I make'. One of his display cakes depicted a trio of crosses on a hill, with the words 'He Has Risen.' He had not been deeply religious until after he fathered two children, when he was driving one day and had an epiphany. 'The Holy Spirit convicted me of my sin', he said. The baker said he once employed a gay man . in his shop and insisted he makes regular birthday cakes for a lesbian couple. How it all began: The battle started almost two years ago when Mr Mullins posted this photo on Facebook . Campaign: The couple then stood in the streets with placards and the shop was inundated with calls . When Mr Craig and Mr Mullins were growing up, meanwhile, gay marriage was a foreign concept. Mr Craig graduated from high school in Wyoming the same year Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, was killed because of his orientation. He said he still feels awkward holding hands in public, adding: 'I feel like something bad could happen to us.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . For 13-year-old Jacob Wisnik it was always going to be one of the biggest days of his life, but what he couldn't have imagined was the sybolism his Bar Mitzvah ceremony was going to carry. While other teens would be celebrating their coming-of-age in synagogue halls across the United States, Jacob decided he wanted to honor his grandather by having his in the Polish town his grandfather fled in 1935. There hadn’t been a Jewish service in the Zamosc Synagogue since before the Holocaust so it was fitting that Jacob decided to return to honor the struggle of his family. Scroll down for video . The way it was: There hadn't been a Jewish service in the Zamosc Synagogue since before the Holocaust, until earlier this month when a 13-year-old New York boy came to the city his grandfather fled in 1935 to celebrate his Bar Mitzvah . Tribute: Jacob’s maternal grandfather escaped the Nazis when he was just a small child to the Soviet Union . Zamosc synagogue: Now 400 years old and once the spiritual center of a vibrant community, it is the city's sole link to its Hebrew heritage . 'My grandfather, Abram Szlak, who was born in this town, would have become a Bar Mitzvah in this very synagogue if not for World War II,' said Jacob Wisnik to Fox News. Jacob’s maternal grandfather escaped the Nazis when he was just a small child to the Soviet Union. He, along with 6,000 of the 12,000 Jews living in Zamosc near the Ukrainian border fled. The Nazis murdered those who remained. Family portrait: Jacob¿s dad, Robert, said that all of the the family's ancestors were from Poland. His family came to America in the 1920s . New experience: 70 guests made the trip over to Poland to celebrate with Jacob. The majority were gentiles with most having never been to a Jewish service . Making a point: People have tried to destroy the Jews for thousands of years, Jacob said in his speech, as the Nazis tried during the Holocaust. But the Jewish people survive . Jacob's Bar Mitzvah is not just a milestone in his own life but also for the synagogue in which prayers and Torah chanting had not been heard in 75 years. Jews had been in Zamosc since 1588, and nearly half of its 25,000 citizens were of the faith before the Nazi occupation. Today, Zamosc has no Jews. Its synagogue, once the spiritual center of a vibrant community, is the city's sole link to its Hebrew heritage. The synagogue, more than 400 years old, was severely damaged and vandalized during the Nazi occupation. Now restored, it is a cultural center used for lectures and concerts. There were 3.3 million Jews in Poland before the Holocaust. Only 10,000 remain. Proud of his roots in history, Jacob looked to the future with optimism. 'Perhaps my Bar Mitzvah is the first of many more in Zamosc,' he said. Rabbi David Holz, the Wisnik family’s rabbi from Westchester County, led the service, accompanying the songs with a guitar. People have tried to destroy the Jews for thousands of years, Jacob said in his speech, as the Nazis tried during the Holocaust. But the Jewish people survive. That was the message in his Torah reading, and his Bar Mitzvah in Zamosc was proof the attempted destruction hadn’t succeeded. 'Jake, you are the newest link in the unbroken chain of Jewish tradition through three thousand years, from Moses to this day,' the rabbi said. Jacob’s dad, Robert, said that all of the the family's ancestors were from Poland. His family came to America in the 1920s. His mom, Eva, and her parents arrived in the United States in 1968 when the Polish communist government launched an anti-Semitic campaign. Spiritual: The sounds of prayers from the Torah had not been heard in the synagogue for 75 years . From generation to generation: Proud of his roots in this history, Jacob looked to the future with optimism. 'Perhaps my Bar Mitzvah is the first of many more in Zamosc,' he said . 70 guests made the trip over to Poland to celebrate with Jacob. The majority were gentiles with most having never been to a Jewish service. It was a new experience for high school teacher, Beata Pisarczyk-Zabicel. 'I thought it would be more formal,' she said. 'I was surprised by the guitar … and the clapping and singing. It was so joyful. I wanted to sing along.' Pisarczyk-Zabicel’s student, Ewa Broszko, 18, said she’d read about Judaism, but actually seeing the Bar Mitzvah made her studies real. In present-day Poland, many young Poles have never met a fellow Jew and are unaware about the vibrant Jewish past. There are still anti-Semitic incidents in the country and graffiti appeared on the Zamosc Synagogue last fall. A Polish non-profit is helping to promote tolerance in the country through education. The Forum for Dialogue attempts to educating Poles about the Jewish religion and the country’s rich Jewish history.","Jacob Wisnik, 13, was Bar Mitzvah at Zamosc Synagogue in Poland .

"By . Ruth Styles . The last king to sit on it was poisoned at his own wedding, so it was perhaps no surprise that the Queen preferred not to take the Iron Throne when she visited the Game of Thrones set. Instead, the monarch inspected the seat, which is made from interlaced iron swords, from a safe distance before getting a closer look at the royal treasury of Westeros, laid out beside it. She was, however, happy to hold a tiny replica and beamed as she met cast members, among them Kit Harington who plays Jon Snow, Lena Headey who  plays Queen Cersei Lannister and Sophie Turner who plays Sansa Stark. Scroll down for video . One will not be sitting there! The Queen looks reluctant to take the famous Iron Throne, instead choosing to inspect it from a safe distance . Nice . to meet you: The Queen is introduced to Game of Thrones cast members, . among them Kit Harrington (Jon Snow) and Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark) No thank you! The Queen looks less than impressed as she examines the throne, watched by Game of Thrones star Lena Headey . The set, which is in Belfast's recently completed Titanic Quarter, is where many of the scenes inside King's Landing - the royal palace of Westeros - are filmed. Home to the wicked queen Cersei Lannister, King's Landing was the scene of several Machiavellian plots and scores of unpleasant murders, among them that of the 'Mad King' Aerys II Targaryen who was stabbed in the back by Cersei's brother, Jaime. Luckily for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, the cast were on their best behaviour and chatted politely with the royal couple as they showed them around the set. Maisie Williams, the 17-year-old star who plays the spirited Arya Stark, was the first of the actors to chat to the monarch. 'She kept commenting on how uncomfortable the throne looked, that was funny,' she said. Looks uncomfortable! Buckingham Palace refused to say whether the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh watch Game of Thrones . Curious? The Queen steps a little closer to the throne which according to Westeros legend, is made from more than 1000 swords - is she tempted to take a seat? One is amused! The Queen seemed in good spirits during her tour of the set while the Duke of Edinburgh was fascinated by the knives and swords . 'I don't think I've ever been as nervous . to meet anybody,' added Headey. 'I didn't think I was, and then I saw her appear and I . suddenly thought, ""it's the Queen, the real Queen""! She was really cool and gorgeous and delightful. 'I . think of everything she has done and everything she has achieved and . the fact she is still interested even though she has met countless . people and talked about numerous things.' Equally excited was Harrington. 'Being here and meeting the Queen, it's . pretty amazing that the show has done that and she has come to see the . sets. It gives it some sense of scale,' he said. 'She is an . incredible person. She has an incredible presence about her. To meet . someone who has been on the throne as long as she has and has seen the . things she has, it's quite an experience.'

The HBO drama, which emerged from a set of fantasy novels by George R. R Martin, is thought to be loosely based on the Wars of the Roses, which saw two opposing dynasties battle it out for the throne of England. With York on one side and Lancaster on . the other, England was convulsed by a series of battles, dastardly plots . and pretenders lurking on the other side of the Channel until, with the . death of Richard III, Lancaster finally triumphed. The Queen, who also holds the title and . the lands of the Duchy of Lancaster, had earlier been given a snapshot . into the UK's more recent bloody past, visiting the infamous Crumlin .

Afterwards, he told the BBC that the meeting was about 'reaching out the hand of friendship to the Unionist community'. 'I met Queen Elizabeth tonight in my role as Deputy First Minister, representing the entire community,' he added.

The Queen's visit to the Game of Thrones set was one of a series of engagements scheduled in and around Belfast today. After a lunch at Belfast City Hall with local dignitaries, the monarch visited the lovely St George's covered market, where she chatted to stallholders and met well-wishers. She also became the latest victim of an unscheduled royal selfie, as an eager young fan tried to snap a photo with her on his iPhone - much to the consternation of the Queen's security detail.

"By . Jack Doyle . A major overhaul is needed to curb  migrants’ access to British benefits, a Government review has concluded. The report finds growing concern among Britons about access to the welfare state by the hundreds of thousands of arrivals from Europe taking advantage of EU free movement rules. If the system is not urgently reformed it could ‘significantly undermine’ public support for freedom of movement, it concludes. Unemployed people at a Jobcentre Plus: A report says the public wants curbs on migrants' access to benefits . The report, published today, cites clear evidence that EU migration has put pressure on public services such as the NHS and schools. And it concludes that EU court rulings have allowed an explosion in illegal activity such as fake passports and sham marriages by non-EU migrants trying to live and work in Britain. The report, which is based on submissions from businesses, interest groups and members of the public, was due to be published earlier this year. But a Whitehall source said senior Lib Dems blocked its release because they feared it was too critical of the EU. Pro-immigration Business Secretary Vince Cable has claimed that increases in migration are a ‘good thing’. He told the BBC he had ordered the report to be rewritten because it was ‘propagandist’. But its final conclusions are far from comfortable for the Lib Dems as it highlights a great many problems which have resulted from mass EU migration and calls for urgent action to combat them. It is one of a number of reports into the EU’s influence on British government and society and how it should be curtailed as part of the renegotiation of membership proposed by David Cameron ahead of a referendum in 2017. Pro-immigration Business Secretary Vince Cable who ordered the report to be rewritten, has claimed that increases in migration are a 'good thing' The review found evidence of growing public opposition to mass EU migration as numbers entering the country have ballooned over the last decade. Shifts in attitudes show the British public have gone from being two-to-one in favour of free movement in 2005 to, last year, nearly half being opposed. It found that free movement rights have been gradually extended – in part by EU judges - far beyond the original intention of member states, and cites concerns around whether existing welfare restrictions are ‘fit for purpose’. It points to abuse and fraud of free movement rules by non EU migrants using fake passports, and growing evidence of sham marriages being used to get EU citizenship. EU rules make it harder to send home even convicted criminals, and ministers must ‘respond effectively’ to concerns about criminals abusing free movement, it says. At the same time, Britons struggle to find work overseas because other countries fail to implement EU rules on fair working properly. The review also cites evidence that workers in low paid jobs can lose out from mass migration when the economy is weak because of competition for jobs and lower wages. Slough Council, which has seen high levels of immigration, cited the phenomenon of the ‘Slough Shed’ where landlords put immigrant workers in sheds, garages and outhouses of the homes they own. And the report found evidence of mass EU migration having contributed to more people living on the streets in some areas. Number of EU migrants living in Britain from eight Eastern European states, including Poland, who joined the EU in 2004, have increased from 125,000 a year to more than 1 million in 2012. Romanian and Bulgarian nationals have increased from 20,000 to 155,000. And more recently there has been a sharp increase in migrants from southern European countries such as Spain hit by economic difficulties – leading to a 50 per cent rise in EU migrants. Theresa May by the UK border at Heathrow: The number of EU migrants in Britain from eight Eastern European states who joined the EU in 2004, has increased from 125,000 a year to more than 1 million in 2012 . The report said: ‘The Government considers that now is an appropriate time to review the EU level rules with a view to modernisation and ensuring they are fit for purpose in the EU of today. ‘The rules have evolved beyond the original scope as the EU has evolved…weakening the ability of Member states to determine how their systems operate.’ ‘These problems are magnified by the fact that the EU of today is very different to when the rules were created. It says that ‘without reform’ around welfare rules, ‘legitimate public concern about how EU migrants access social security…is likely to significantly undermine support for the principle of free movement.’ The report contains calls from academics and think tanks for a cap of 75,000 in the number of EU migrants allowed in every year. Other campaign groups call for migrant workers to have to wait five years before they get full access to Britain’s benefit systems. Another suggestion is that home countries should pay unemployment benefit for their own nationals for the first six months they live in another state. Backbench Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said there was not enough understanding of how mass migration had impacted on Britain. He is co-chairman of the Fresh Start group of Tory MPs, which has drawn up a list of powers to be repatriated from Brussels. He said: ‘With free movement comes pressure on housing, education and the NHS. ‘The government should have done this long ago, to see where these pressures can fall, and how we can better manage them.’","Report, due for release earlier this year, was delayed by Liberal Democrats .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A solicitor and a gang who organised fake weddings have been jailed for more than 16 years. Mohammed Akhtar, 28, used his job as a solicitor to make contact with immigrants from the sub-continent whose visas had expired. His partners in crime mother and son pair Vera Horvatova, 53, and Leon Horvat, 21, recruited women from the Czech community in Wolverhampton, West Midlands to act as fake brides. Happy never after: Crooked Lucie Ondicova, 25, during a sham wedding ceremony for which she has been jailed for 10 months . Akhtar carried out his fraud for more than a year, charging hefty fees for his services before he was caught in in July last year. He methodically compiled dossiers for each ‘couple’, which contained staged photographs to give the appearance the bride and groom were long-term lovers. Akhtar also doctored bank statements and employment references and even wrote a fake love letter for one case. Mother and son, their work's never done: Vera Horvatova (left) was sent down for three years after she admitted breaking UK . immigration; her son Leon Horvat (right) was jailed for 32 months . But the authorities cottoned on to Akhtar’s scheme when they were notified about a suspicious marriage by Wolverhampton Register Office. Home office officials attended the office on July 26 and arrested him along with three other people. Akhtar, of Wolverhampton, pleaded guilty to 11 counts of conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of immigration law by a non-EU person and asked for 10 other counts to be taken into consideration. He was jailed for five years at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Thursday along with eight others in a scheme the judge said was ‘a sophisticated criminal conspiracy developed to make money’. The court heard foreign national Sandeep Bhullar had been given 60 days’ notice to leave the UK in July last year when she contacted Akhtar. He then plotted to give her the right to stay in the country by claiming his fixer Leon Horvat was her lover. Prison for sham marriage fixers: Ishwarjot Singh from Smethwick has been jailed for one year as has Sandeep Bhullar of Corley, Warwickshire . Jail: Crooked solicitor Mohammed Aktar from Wolverhampton has been jailed for five years; Lucie Ondicova, 23, also of Wolverhampton has been sentenced to 10 months in jail . A file found at Akhtar’s home contained stage photographs of the pair pretending to be a couple as well as a letter giving her blessing from Horvat’s mother Vera Horvatova. Horvat of Wolverhampton, was jailed for 32 months after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law by a non-EU person, one count of participating in a sham marriage and one count of conspiring to arrange a shame marriage. And his mother Horvatova, also of Wolverhampton, was caged for three years after she admitted charges relating to conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law by a non-EU person. Crooked: Lucie Ondicova pictured during a sham wedding ceremony. The 25-year-old from Wolverhampton has been jailed for 10 months . Six other people involved in the sham were also jailed after admitting the same charge – while one woman was given a suspended sentence. Prosecutor Elisabeth Bussey-Jones told the court: ‘Akhtar was the key organiser. The arrangements involved large sums paid by foreign nationals. His motive was clearly profit.’ Wedding fixers: Petra Michalkova, 33, of Wolverhamptonm sent down for 10 months; Ingrid Munova, 36 (right), also of Wolverhampton received a term of six months in jail . Sham wedding fixer Veronika Ondicova, 23, of Wolverhampton has been sentenced to 10 months in jail . Speaking . about when suspicions were aroused on July 4 last year, she added: . ‘[Akhtar] claimed to be present with the bride and groom as an . interpreter and a witness to the wedding. But staff became suspicious when the couple showed very little interaction and appeared to know nothing about one another.’ The amount Akhtar charged for his services will not be revealed until a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing takes place in October this year. Home Office Inspector Andy Radcliffe said sums ranging between £1,000 and £10,000 are common for sham weddings. Insp Radcliffe – who headed the 10-month investigation which led to the arrests – said: ‘This was a long-running, successful operation which has resulted in substantial prison sentences being handed out to those involved. ‘The system is designed to help genuine couples stay in the UK but others like Akhtar try to exploit it for financial gain. ‘In terms of identifying participants we are reliant on information from registrars and members of the public to help us. ‘Finding and prosecuting these individuals is very much a priority for the Home Office. ‘It is possible that some of them didn’t see it as a crime as there is no identifiable victim. ‘But the tax-paying public in the UK is the real victim.’ Mohammed Akhtar, 28, of Wolverhampton – five years in jail . Leon Horvat, 21, of Wolverhampton – two years and eight months . Vera Horvatova, 53, of Wolverhampton – three years . Ishwarjot Singh, 25, of Smethwick – one year .

But it wasn't all bizarre swimwear and brooding models. The latest round of menswear shows kicked off in Milan on Saturday, with Calvin Klein, Marni and Jil Sander among the big names setting the standard.

In a far cry from Versace's buffed and bronzed models, many on the Westwood catwalk sported pig's noses, while t-shirts came emblazoned with a pig logo. Despite the politics, much of what was on offer was sporty perfection, with beautifully cut joggers and some excellent tailoring among the highlights.

Hollande, 59, split with former First Lady and partner of ten years Valerie Trierweiler after he was caught making late night visits to actress Ms Gayet in January. Revelations of the president’s cheating in glossy Closer magazine sent 49-year-old Ms Trierweiler into hospital for a week suffering from shock. But his love affair with Ms Gayet, 41, has now ‘unravelled’, France’s Gala magazine reported. It said that according a friend of Ms Gayet: 'As an actress she may be used to public attention, but with Mr Hollande it became too much for her.' The magazine also blamed the return to the cabinet of Segolene Royal - Hollande’s partner of 30 years and mother of his four children - for the break up. The former 2007 presidential candidate was appointed environment minister earlier this months after five years in the political wilderness. Meanwhile, a new book released last week has claimed Mr Hollande is ‘missing’ Ms Trierweiler and becoming attached to the former journalist once again. The book called ‘The President who Wanted to Live his Lives’, by journalist Elise Karlin, claims that the president remains ‘tender and considerate’ towards his ex-partner. It says Mr Hollande even bought Ms Trierweiler flowers when they met for a meal at one of their favourite restaurants in Paris last month. Hollande split with Valerie Trierweiler (left) after he was caught visiting actress Ms Gayet (right) in January . The book claims the president ‘hates solitude’ and has given the impression his feelings for her are ‘far from extinguished’. Friends have also been quoted as saying he is almost ‘harassing’ her with tender text messages. However, the book also alleges that Ms Trierweiler expects a public act of contrition on his part before any reconciliation. But it also hints the president may have the ulterior motive of trying to stop Ms Trierweiler from writing her own tell-all book about their break-up.","Julie Gayet allegedly told friends she was unable to cope with the pressure .

"By . Mark Duell . The two people who died after being struck by a freight train at  a level crossing in apparent suicide pact were today named as an elderly married couple who lived nearby. Peter Smith, 80, and Betty Evelyn Smith, 79, were killed instantly just before noon yesterday near the Allenby Estates unmanned level crossing close to their home in Cherry Willingham, Lincolnshire. The couple were said to have walked onto the railway line in the village near Lincoln, straight into the path of the 60mph freight train - ignoring the warning horn sounded by the driver of the engine. Scroll down for video . Level crossing: The scene where a couple died after being hit by a train in Cherry Willingham, Lincolnshire . Probe: Officers and rail workers at the scene of the incident where British Transport Police are investigating . Their family said in a statement . released through police today: ‘We are deeply saddened by our loss and . we would now like to ask for privacy while we come to terms with what . has happened.’ British . Transport Police said its officers were working to establish the full . circumstances of the incident, which is currently being treated as . non-suspicious. Witnesses . told how the train driver sounded the horn for at least a minute on the . approach to the crossing. This morning a floral tribute was placed close . to where the tragedy occurred. Neighbours . of the couple paid tribute to the ‘beautiful’ and ‘devoted’ couple who . had lived in the village for over 50 years – adding that they had both . seemed very happy and in good health. Mr Smith was said to have been a postmaster, who retired after a car crash 20 years ago, while Mrs Smith had never worked. Joyce . Garner, 94, who lives two doors down from the couple’s home, said: ‘I . just can’t believe it. They used to have dogs up until a few years ago . and I would see them walking them every day. Remembered: This morning a floral tribute was placed close to where the tragedy occurred in Lincolnshire . ‘Peter had to retire early from his . job as a postman more than 20 years ago after a car crash, but Betty was . always in the garden and he would try and help where he could.’ Margaret . Elkington, 81, who has lived on their road for 38 years, added: ‘They . seemed to be such a happy couple. They would catch the bus into Lincoln . every Monday and Saturday. ‘I . spoke to them on this last Monday about the weather while they waited . for the bus and they were fine. They had a daughter but they didn’t . speak about her very much.’ Neighbour . Jack Haggar, 83, said: ‘They were very pleasant but a family which kept . themselves to themselves. Peter and Betty always stopped to speak. It . has come as a terrible shock.’ Local butcher Derek Wilkinson, 59, said he had known the couple for 50 years. He . added: ‘Peter and Betty were very private people and they’d lived in . the village for as long as I can remember. They were regular customers . of mine and came in every week. Response: East Midlands Ambulance Service workers attended and both people were pronounced dead . Further back: Emergency services worked to put up screens to shield local schoolchildren from the scene . ‘Peter . would come in and buy their Sunday roasts and their meat for their . midweek meals including chops and sausages. Peter used to do the . shopping. I think that they will both be very sadly missed.’ The . Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed and the Central . Lincolnshire Coroner is expected to open inquests in the next few days. The . train - which was heading for Immingham Docks in North Lincoln - was . brought to a halt at a second level crossing in the village and just . 600ft from a secondary school holding its sports day. Emergency . services worked to put up screens to shield the schoolchildren from the . scene, and staff had to arrange for pupils to take alternative routes . home. The user-worked . crossing consists of a 12ft wide metal gate. Drivers have to ring . through to the main signal box for clearance to open the gates and cross . but pedestrians can walk across via a stile. East . Midlands Ambulance Service pronounced both people dead at the scene. Passenger services between Lincoln and Grimsby were halted for three . hours before resuming later in the afternoon. Stoppages: Services between Grimsby and Lincoln have been affected and parts of the line have been suspended . Investigation: The incident just before midday is being treated by British Transport Police as 'non-suspicious' Stop Look Listen: Signs warning members of the public to take care near the level crossing in Lincolnshire . Local . resident Tony Pick, 68, a retired civil engineer, said yesterday: 'I . came back home just seconds before the ambulances arrived and it was . then I noticed a body lying 100 yards down the track. 'It . was an elderly woman as far as I could tell. It's very shocking as you . don't really get anything like this happen around here. It is a quiet . area.' Plumber Mark Daykin was working 200 yards from where the initial impact is said to have happened. 'We are deeply saddened by our loss and we would now like to ask for privacy while we come to terms with what has happened' Family of Peter and Betty Evelyn Smith . He . said: ‘I was working with my boss and we heard the train beep. The . driver really gave it the whole horn. We went down to the foot crossing. It looked as though the impact had been there. ‘There . were no emergency services there yet and we walked further down the . line towards the railway bridge where there was blood on the track. ‘It . looked as though the train carried on further down the line. We left . when the fire service arrived and said it wasn't a very nice scene down . there.’ And former military . policeman Mike Barker, 67, said: ‘I was out for a walk when I heard the . sirens and then we saw the freight train on the level crossing. ‘An . ambulance was already there. We heard that two people had been killed . further down the line towards Lincoln and this is where the train ended . up. Freight train: East Midlands Ambulance Service attended but both people involved in the accident were pronounced dead at the scene in Lincolnshire . Disruption: Services between Grimsby and Lincoln have been affected and parts of the line have been suspended . Location: The incident happened just before midday at the footpath near this level crossing (file picture) ‘There is a school and . two old people's homes on the street and it can take quite a while to . walk across the crossing if you're not fit.’ A BTP spokesman said yesterday: ‘Our officers are currently in attendance at a level crossing in Croft Lane, Cherry Willingham, where two people have been struck by a train. The incident was reported to BTP at 11.57am on July 9 and colleagues from Lincolnshire Police are also on scene. ‘Medics from the East Midlands Ambulance Service are in attendance and both people have been pronounced dead at the scene.

"By . Nick Fagge . Facebook is losing its appeal to teenagers as more and more parents start using it to keep tabs on them, researchers have discovered. They say youngsters now consider the social networking site ‘dead and buried’ and are too embarrassed to post intimate details in case their mothers or fathers find out. The research, which looked into the online habits of teenagers in eight European countries including the UK, found many young Facebook users were switching to alternatives such as Snapchat and WhatsApp. Scroll down for video . Losing its edge? Facebook was once the coolest site on the web - until it was joined by the world's parents . The Global Social Media Impact study said teenagers were switching to Snapchat (left) and WhatsApp (right) Professor Daniel Miller of University College London, who worked on the Global Social Media Impact Study, said British youngsters were ‘embarrassed even to be associated with it’. He added: ‘Young people are turning away in their droves and adopting other social networks instead, while the worst people of all, their parents, continue to use the service.’ Professor Miller said teenagers now regarded Facebook as ‘so uncool’, adding: ‘You can’t be young and free if you know your parents can access your every indiscretion. Young people care about style and status in relation to their peers, and Facebook is simply not cool any more. ‘Where once parents worried about their children joining Facebook, the children now say it is their family that insists they stay there to post about their lives. Parents have worked out how to use the site and they see it as a way for the family to remain connected. ‘What appears to be the most seminal moment in a young person’s decision to leave Facebook was surely that dreaded day that your mum sends you a friend request.’ Is that your mum? Teenagers are losing interest in Facebook, the study found (photo posed by models) However, the study found many teenagers do continue to use Facebook to stay connected with older family members or siblings who have left home. The research, funded by the European Union, looked at the behaviour of 16 to 18-year-olds over a 15-month period. It also discovered that up to 40 per cent of Facebook users had never changed their privacy settings and 80 per cent ‘did not care’ if their personal data  was available to organisations or individuals. Facebook was launched by Mark Zuckerberg and his friends from their university dormitory room in 2004. He floated it on the US stock market eight years later for more than £60 billion. Of the new generation of  sites popular with teenagers, Snapchat is a picture sharing service and WhatsApp allows smartphone users to interact using text, video, images and audio. Another popular alternative is Instagram, which allows users to upload and share photographs – and is owned by Facebook.","Alternative picture-sharing apps are growing along with Instagram .

"By . Nick Fagge . and Rebecca Camber . Convicted: Emil Metodiev was allowed into the UK despite having a string of convictions for burglary . A Bulgarian who burgled a family’s home only nine days after arriving in Britain is a violent drug dealer who had been freed by police in exchange for informing on other crooks, it emerged yesterday. Emil Metodiev, 32, was caught red-handed fleeing from a house in Essex with jewellery, cash and war medals. Following his conviction last week, it can be revealed that the career criminal has an appalling record for violent robbery, burglary and drug dealing in his homeland, with convictions stretching back 15 years. Despite this, he was repeatedly released back on to the streets and was free to come to Britain after Bulgarian police struck a deal to recruit him as an informant. Last night campaigners said the farcical case outlined the need to retain visa controls on Bulgarians and Romanians, which are due to lapse on January 1. A senior police source in Bulgaria told the Mail: ‘Emil Paraskevov Metodiev was acquitted of charges of dealing heroin despite being caught red-handed because he benefited from a deal with police to give evidence against conspirators higher up the chain. ‘He was later arrested for burglary and singled out at an ID parade by the man he held at knifepoint. But the state prosecutor ordered that the case was dropped and he walked free. Then his family gave him money to buy a train ticket to London.’ Known by the nickname ‘Zhuzhkata’, which means ‘Buzz’ in English, Metodiev is notorious in the town of Radomir, in western Bulgaria, where he was born into a large Roma family. One neighbour recalled: ‘The last time I saw him, he was driving around in a fast car, showing off. He was always in trouble with the police and spent years in prison.’ He is also well known to police in the neighbouring mining town of Pernik. A local police source said: ‘His first conviction for drug dealing was when he was 18. Since then he has been convicted many times of robbery and burglary as well as drugs.’ Metodiev has been convicted of selling drugs in other cities including the capital Sofia. Caught: The home (pictured), which he targeted at 7am on October 31, is owned by Trevor Toms, 62 . In September 2009 he was arrested with seven consignments of heroin. But he was released after serving only three months on remand when he struck a deal with police to give evidence against high-ranking members of the criminal network. In April 2011 he allegedly broke into a family home in Pernik. The victim, Slavi Krakov, 21, said: ‘I woke up at 4am and saw the thief. He wanted money and when I said I didn’t have any he pulled out a knife and slashed me across the head. I thought he was going to kill me.’ Police arrested Metodiev but he was released after the state prosecutor dropped the case. On October 22 this year he arrived in the UK on a train from Sofia. Nine days later Metodiev was caught after stealing a handbag, cash, war medals, mobile phones and jewellery from the Toms family’s home in Southend. Denise Toms, 55, woke to find  the downstairs of her home  being ransacked. Her husband Trevor, 62, chased the thief into the street, while their son Adam, 19, who was only wearing underpants, ran after him, leaping over fences into neighbouring gardens. Police were called and found Metodiev hiding in bushes clutching the  stolen goods. Apprehended: The Bulgarian burglar was caught after being pursued by homeowner Trevor Toms (right), 62, and his 19-year-old son, Adam (left), who chased the crook across gardens in only his underwear . Last week, at Basildon Crown Court, Metodiev was jailed for 16 months after admitting burglary. He will be deported at the end of his sentence. Prosecutor Richard Kelly said: ‘He had only been in the UK for a few days and had no independent means of income. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the reason he came to the UK was to commit crime.’ Metodiev was allowed to enter the UK because EU law states that previous criminal convictions do not constitute automatic grounds for restricting the right to move freely within the bloc. Tory MP Philip Hollobone said: ‘This is a farcical situation. It shows what you get when you open your borders to all and sundry. ‘This case indicates that we have a wave of criminals coming our way, that police forces in this country do not know enough about the individuals that come here and that Romanian and Bulgarian authorities need to tell the UK police about the backgrounds of these criminals.’ The Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior said: ‘We cannot give any information about this case because Metodiev may be involved with an on-going investigation.’","Emil Metodiev, 32, took jewellery, cash and war medals from Essex home .

"By . Nick Fagge . 'Unwelcome advances': MP Mike Hancock faces serious allegations about the his conduct . The woman at the centre of the  latest Lib Dem sex scandal has told how she contemplated suicide over the ‘disgusting’ way she has been treated by the party. And the vulnerable mother of one condemned its leader Nick Clegg, saying he had shown disregard for her welfare after  she accused Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock of sexually harassing her. The 39-year-old from Portsmouth told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s dreadful how I’ve been treated. The Lib Dems have tried to sweep my complaints under the carpet. ‘This should have been dealt with ages ago, in 2010 when I first came forward, rather than now. ‘The whole of their party should all be held to account and they should hang their heads in shame. Nick Clegg said he would clean up his party but he has done nothing.’ The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, complained about Mr Hancock’s alleged harassment to senior Lib Dem officials almost three years ago at the party’s Westminster headquarters. In a letter to Mr Clegg, she said the MP had exposed himself to her, made numerous unwanted sexual advances, forcibly kissed her and twice ran his fingers through her hair. She was subjected to two gruelling interviews by senior Lib Dem officials, who tested her claims. But it is only now that Mr Hancock, 67, has finally been suspended by the party. Yesterday, the alleged victim, who has a 16-year-old son, told how the distress caused by the long-running saga had affected her fragile mental health – and even made her consider suicide. ‘I’ve thought to myself maybe I should take my own life, but I have a son to think of.’ She added that she has to live with the memories of what is alleged to have happened with Mr Hancock ‘every day’ and has suffered from depression ever since. ‘I feel I have been let down by all authorities,’ she said. ‘You know, the police, Liberal Democrat party, Nick Clegg, you know, everybody that’s been involved. ‘I have been hugely let down. My voice has never been heard.’ 'You are special and sexy':  Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock allegedly sent a string of lewd texts containing filthy comments to woman, who had mental health problems and had previously been sexually abused . She first met Mr Hancock in October 2009 at his constituency office in Southsea, after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours. A year later, he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged unwanted sexual advances. He was never charged after police found there was no case to answer. The woman added that unlike the Lib Dem members who complained about Lord Rennard,  she never had her allegations taken seriously. She said: ‘I feel over the Rennard stuff because they are in a high position, the women  – they have actually been heard. But whereas if it’s an individual like me, they don’t really get listened to.’ The victim, who suffers from a long-term mental illness, said the affair had exacerbated her condition, adding: ‘I see someone because of my mental health but this whole situation has made it worse. ‘It has made me angry, upset and depressed. I’m very emotional. At times it has made me suicidal. I’ve had to take more medication because of it.’ She added: ‘Nick Clegg said people with mental health problems should get extra help. ‘Well he needs to practice what he preaches.’ The report into Mr Hancock’s conduct, by Nigel Pascoe QC, was delivered to the party in August. The MP had voluntarily resigned the Liberal Democrat whip  in June after the woman threatened to sue. Mr Hancock did not give evidence to Mr Pascoe. But it was never published and on Tuesday the Lib Dem-controlled council in Portsmouth – where Mr Hancock is also a local councillor – voted to keep it under wraps. It emerged only when political blogger Guido Fawkes published it on Wednesday. Mr Pascoe’s report found that the vulnerable constituent – who had been sexually abused as a child – had been bombarded by lewd text messages from Mr Hancock for months. The alleged victim, who gave evidence under oath, said in the report: ‘He forcibly kissed me. ‘He grabbed my arms and he stuck his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him away and I shouted up to my son and he put his hand over my mouth and was restraining me really hard and I had red marks on my arms.’ On another occasion, she reported: ‘He came round and said he was feeling horny. ‘I said “go home to your wife” and “what kind of woman do you think I am?” ‘I was sat away from him and he started rubbing himself.’ She said he undid his belt and flies and exposed himself. ‘I said “put it away, I think you are disgusting and you need some  help, you have a sexual problem”, she added. The alleged victim, referred to in the report as AH, told the QC: ‘That was the worst time, this really affected me.’ In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe wrote: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock. I am of the clear view that her account is credible  and merits both compassion  and respect. ‘I found AH to be a straightforward and vulnerable person, angry and hurt by what she said had happened to her.’ Mr Hancock denies the allegations. October 2009 - The woman, known as AH,  meets Mike Hancock for the first time at his surgery to ask for help over dispute with  neighbours. February 2010 - Mr Hancock first visits  AH’s house. March 2010 . - The MP takes the woman and her son on a visit to Parliament. He gives . her  a teddy bear as a present and starts sending her text messages. June 2010 - AH has a hysterectomy. July 2010 - She makes first complaint about his behaviour to her family support worker. This is passed to the police. September 2010 - AH asks police to open inquiries into Mr Hancock. December 2010 - AH is told that police will not take action. March 2011 - She writes to Lib Dem HQ for the first time about the allegations. No action is taken. 2012 – Lib Dems decide not to take the case further. February 2013 - Nick Clegg’s office receives a letter from AH’s solicitor detailing the case. He accepts he received this. June 2013 - Mr Hancock resigns the Lib Dem whip after AH launches a civil case.","Alleged victim says she has been let down and considered suicide .

"By . Anna Edwards . and Sam Webb . and John Stevens . and Nick Fagge . and Amie Keeley . Mary Evans, who was last night stabbed to death in Luton. Her brother-in-law has been arrested for her murder . A 70-year-old woman has been stabbed to death in her car just yards from her home. Mary Evans, who remarried six weeks ago, was attacked on the way to pick up her grandson from school. Neighbours heard shouting and raced outside to see a man with a blade and her slumped at the wheel of her crashed car. Two of them brought the knifeman to the ground while others tried to save Mrs Evans’s life. She was pronounced dead by paramedics and police who had raced to her bungalow in Luton. Last night a relative said she understood Mrs Evans had stopped her car when a man flagged her down. ‘All we know is that there was an argument and Mary was screaming,’ she said. ‘The neighbours on the street were fantastic. Two people stopped him from running off and kept the knife for police as well as calling the ambulance.’ Friends said Mrs Evans, a retired cashier known as May, had finally found happiness with her third husband David, who she had lived next door to for 20 years. She had lost her second partner in 2007, a son to spina bifida in 2003 and two other children in infancy. Mrs Evans, who was a volunteer at the local hospital, was described by her younger sister as a very caring person. Shirley Vincent told ITV Anglia: ‘She . was my big sister and she liked to be called the matriarch of the . family, being the eldest. 'She . could be quite odd – but she didn’t like to think she was an old lady, . she was 70. She lived for her daughter and her grandson. She was there . for everybody.’ Kind: Mrs Evans, who was a volunteer at the local hospital, was described by her younger sister as a very caring person . A local . resident, Punita Sonagra, 37, said: ‘She was a big inspiration as a . person of her age looking after so many people. I feel sad.’ A man in his 50s was last night being held on suspicion of murder. Neighbour . Punita Sonagra said: 'May was really happy after a long time. She had a . disabled son who passed away and her husband had some problems and he . died too. She had a daughter and grandchild and she always helped out. 'She . was a big inspiration as a person of her age looking after so many . people.I feel sad. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. 'She has suffered all her life. Where is the justice? That she has been treated like that, really upsets me.' The Luton home of 70 year old May Evans, formerly Olloman, who was stabbed to death in her car . Mrs Evans was treated by paramedics at the scene but was pronounced dead shortly afterwards . This morning one resident described the scene: 'I came out and saw the paramedics were attending to the woman driver. At first I thought she had just lost control of the car and crashed into a fence.' During the course of the morning, bunches of flowers and a teddy bear and card were left at the scene. Mrs Evans' family visited the floral tributes, but were too upset to talk. Family liaison officers continue to . support Mrs Evans's family and Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan . Hutchinson of the major crime unit (MCU) is keen to trace anyone who may . have information relating to this inquiry. He . said: 'This was a terribly distressing attack on a defenceless woman . who had recently married and should have been enjoying life with her . family. 'We are in the . process of trying to piece together exactly what happened prior to the . stabbing and although we have arrested a man in connection with this . incident, this inquiry is not solved and we do want to hear from anyone . else who can help with information about what happened.

"By . John Drayton . Germany match-winner Thomas Muller admitted the United States were a difficult team to breakdown after edging to a 1-0 victory in a rainswept Recife. The Bayern Munich midfielder took his overall tally of World Cup goals to nine in the same number of appearances with strike number four in Brazil. That was enough to earn Germany top spot in Group G, and a trip to Porto Alegre on Tuesday to meet the side who finish second in Group H. Only goal: Thomas Muller's strike was enough to give Germany the victory is a hard-fought match . Breakthrough: Muller celebrates his 'bright idea' which ensured Germany finished top of Group G . 'We were dominant,' said Muller. 'All the Americans did was sit back deep in their own half, and when that happens, it just becomes a patience game. 'But sometimes even I manage to have a bright idea - I spend the whole day training like I'm obsessed anyway.' That idea was a pinpoint low strike from the edge of the penalty area which decided Thursday's clash in Germany's favour. 'It was an okay game from us,' added Muller. 'We may only have won it 1-0, but we can take that too.' Only in stoppage time did Jurgen Klinsmann's men come close to breaching the Germany defence, but Philipp Lahm stepped in to block Alejandro Bedoya's effort. It was an otherwise quiet day at the office for the Germany rearguard. On the slide: Philipp Lahm blocks Alejandro Bedoya's shot in the best opening that the USA created . Frustration: Fans in California can not believe their eyes as the USA fall behind to Germany . 'Soccer' fans: America were well supported both at home in the USA and at the stadium in Brazil . 'We had the match under control for most of it today,' said Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels - one of only two players in Joachim Low's starting XI, with Schalke's Benedikt Howedes, not to come from Bayern Munich or Arsenal. 'We kept our concentration well, even if it wasn't really a sensational performance. 'But then no game at this World Cup is easy and this wasn't one we could take for granted today.' Klinsmann could not hide a grin at the final whistle either. The result gave him double cause for celebration as the USA joined his native Germany in the last 16. Satisfaction: Jurgen Klinsmann was animated during the game but able to smile after as both sides progressed . Keeping calm: Joachim Low's side had to be patient but eventually secured the win against the USA . 'We created too few chances, but it's still fantastic to go through,' said the man who led Germany to third place at the World Cup in 2006 before stepping aside to let Low take over. 'Everybody said we had no chance, but we've taken it and we're now in the last 16.'","Thomas Muller's strike the only goal in Germany's 1-0 win against USMNT .

"By . Nick Fagge . The Peace Pledge Union, which distributes controversial white poppies, was awarded a £95,800 grant for a project to honour  conscientious objectors . War veterans condemned the Heritage Lottery Fund yesterday for funding pacifists while refusing to support a school poppy project. The Peace Pledge Union, which distributes controversial white poppies, was awarded a £95,800 grant for a project to honour  conscientious objectors. It follows the lottery fund’s refusal to fund a £92,200 Royal British Legion scheme to help children seed millions of poppies. They were intended to flower in honour of Britain’s fallen servicemen during next year’s First World War centenary commemorations. Graham Mentor-Morris, a former Royal Artilleryman who submitted the lottery bid for the legion’s Greenhithe and Swanscombe branch in Kent, condemned the lottery decision as ‘incredibly wrong’. ‘Some 16 million people died in the First World War and they are not being respected,’ said Mr Mentor-Morris, 58, who served in the Falklands and Northern Ireland. ‘I feel there was a genuine lack of understanding and respect from the Heritage Lottery Fund. They failed to see the bigger picture. ‘The campaign that we tried to seek funding for would have involved people from all walks of life, from children as young as three to people as old as 103. ‘I don’t want to sound bitter, but if you look at the Heritage Lottery Fund they support the trendy things.’ Simon Weston, the Welsh Guardsman badly burned in the Falklands War, said he found the decisions hard to reconcile. ‘Why is remembering conscientious objectors any more worthy than teaching school children about World War I?’ he said. ‘People have died to let these people [pacifists] have the rights and freedoms to hold these views. ‘It seems that the smaller crowd gets the biggest voice. You can be in the majority and be ignored.’ The award follows the lottery fund's refusal to fund a £92,200 Royal British Legion scheme to help children seed millions of poppies . The Peace Pledge Union was founded in 1935 and its members led anti-bombing campaigns during the Second World War. Its ‘white poppy project’ is intended to honour the 16,000 conscientious objectors who refused to bear arms during the First World War. Many were jailed for their beliefs. The project will include the production of new online materials, a range of school activities, public events and an exhibition. The 2014 Real Poppy project, which has the backing of the Prime Minister and the Prince of Wales, will go ahead after DIY chain B&Q stepped in with the money. The Heritage Lottery Fund said it had not been able to fund the seed project due to ‘high demand’. Carole Souter, its chief executive, said: ‘It is disappointing that we were unable to support the Greenhithe and Swanscombe application for a Kent-based project to sow poppies across the county. ‘Demand for our funds is high and we unfortunately cannot fund every application.’ A spokesman for the fund said it was committed to helping people learn about the First World War and has awarded more than £34million for projects marking the centenary.","Peace Pledge Union, which .

"By . John Stevens . and Nick Fagge . The woman who shared a £148million lottery jackpot with her husband and is now separating from him found their gardener ‘irresistible’, according to a friend. Gillian Bayford spotted bodybuilding groundsman Chris Tovey, 40, working at a hotel and hired him as a gardener on the 200-acre, £6million Cambridgeshire estate she had just bought with her husband. The friend last night claimed that Mrs Bayford, 41, then became ‘obsessed’ with him and his impressive physique. Gillian Bayford spotted bodybuilding groundsman Chris Tovey, 40, working at a hotel and hired him as a gardener on the 200-acre, £6million Cambridgeshire estate she had just bought with her husband . Chris Tovey (left), who is married, claims he was run over by Mrs Bayford’s husband Adrian (right) on a golf buggy, and is now suing the couple . But their working relationship came to an abrupt end – Mr Tovey, who is married, claims he was run over by Mrs Bayford’s husband on a golf buggy, and is now suing the couple. Yesterday, Mr Tovey was pictured still on crutches close to his home in Haverhill, Suffolk. Mrs Bayford and her husband Adrian, 43, announced on Wednesday that they are divorcing. A close friend of Mr Tovey’s wife Teri, 32, last night told the Mail: ‘Chris had been working self-employed around the area and they invited him to come and see their new house, and offered him a job working for them full-time. ‘He seemed to enjoy the job and boasted about how much they were paying him. He said that she wore the trousers in the relationship and whatever she wanted at the house went. 'But as things went on we started to notice how much she would call him at all hours. You would be with him for the evening and she would call him two or three times. It was as if she was obsessed.’ The friend added that rumours about the nature of their relationship started when they were seen getting close at a party hosted by the Toveys early this year. She said: ‘They did not stop speaking the whole night long and people were noticing. She seemed to be very flirty. At one point he was showing her his watch and she seemed to be stroking his arm. ‘At the end of the evening she was the first to leave and Chris walked her to her car, but he was gone for over an hour. ‘Teri was going mad in the house. All change: Just over a year since their £148m lottery win Gillian and Adrian Bayford have confirmed their marriage is over . Payout: The Bayfords won £148million in August, one of the biggest lottery jackpots in history . 'She wanted to go out and challenge them about what was going on, but she said she was scared to make a scene because she could not afford for Chris to lose his job. ‘Everyone has always denied that they actually had an affair, but they were certainly close.’ Mr Tovey stopped working for the Bayfords earlier this year after he was seriously injured when a golf buggy being driven by Mr Bayford was involved in a collision. A relative of Mr Tovey’s said: ‘Adrian Bayford was driving the golf buggy around the grounds of his estate and Chris was sitting in the back. Adrian clipped a tree and the whole buggy tipped over. ‘Chris was trapped by it. It crushed his lower leg. He was rushed to hospital. The doctors were very worried because the blood had stopped circulating around his muscle. He might have lost it. ‘He has two massive scars, one down either side of his leg. 'The Bayfords paid him for a few months but then he was called in to see them. New life: Mrs Bayford is said to be living in the couple's £6million Georgian mansion, which has more than 100 acres of land . Down the road: Mr Bayford is now living in this £500,000 house around 10 minutes away from his wife in Suffolk . ‘He has been treated really badly. He worked his heart out for them. He regularly worked over his hours up at the house without complaint.’ When Mr and Mrs Bayford, who have a daughter aged eight and a six-year-old son, announced their split, Mrs Bayford said that their marriage has ‘broken down irretrievably’. Mr Bayford told the Mail: ‘Gillian and I have split. When you win the lottery it’s so stressful. ‘Things happen. Sometimes in life you have to move on. We’re all happy now and life goes on.’ He has moved out of the mansion bought with the EuroMillions jackpot and into a £500,000, four-bedroom home in Haverhill, where the couple lived before the win. The couple’s win in August last year put them 516th on Britain’s Rich List.Mr and Mrs Bayford have strenuously denied rumours of an affair. Mr Tovey last night declined to comment, but his wife said: ‘He was nothing to do with their marriage.’","Adrian and Gillian Bayford EuroMillions  £148m jackpot 15 months ago .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Nick Fagge . Death: Rachel Osei, the teen mother who died in a ball of flames in New Malden, Surrey . These are the first photographs of a teenage mother who died in a fireball after running from her home in flames. Rachel Osei, 18, was heard screaming in agony before collapsing on the pavement where she died from terrible burns. Police believe Miss Osei, who was studying to be a PE teacher at Queen Mary's University, may have caught fire inside her house. Three members of the public tried to extinguish the flames, but they were unable to save her. Neighbours said Miss Osei’s . four-year-old-son Kai was staying with relatives at the time of the . tragedy, which happened early yesterday. Investigators . are treating her death as ‘unexplained’, but it is understood their . main line of inquiry is that her injuries may have been self-inflicted. Last night, her heartbroken father Jonathan Osei, 48, said he could not understand what had happened. ‘Rachel . was at university training to be a sports teacher,’ he said. ‘She . wanted to do well and provide for her son. When I heard about the fire I . tried to call her on her mobile phone but there was no answer. I tried . to protect her but I could not. ‘I loved Rachel, she was a lovely, lovely daughter. I named her after my mother. I had four children but now I have only three.’ The teenager's mother was said to be too upset to talk about the horrific incident this afternoon. Today a grieving male relative, believed to be her brother Justin, said Rachel's mother, Rosalind, did not want to talk about her death. Speaking at the family home he said: 'No, were not talking. My mother doesn't want to talk about it.' Two bouquets of flowers have been left outside her semi-detached home, which has been cordoned off by police following Sunday’s tragedy. Hannah Sirott and Rhianna Price, who left flowers said: 'We had the pleasure of studying music with Rachel for four years. She enjoyed music and rapping. Tragic: The mother of four-year-old Kai was training to be a PE teacher at University . 'She was a good person and she is definitely going to be missed by a lot of people. 'We . have a couple of friends who know her family so we found out about her . death that way. We just didn't want to believe it, it's shocking. 'She was an amazing mum to Kai and was always happy. She was friendly and funny and touched a lot of people's lives.' Queen Mary's University, where the young mother was training to be a PE teacher, paid tribute today. The Twickenham university said in a statement: 'We received the tragic news regarding Rachel's death with great sadness. 'Rachel was a promising Physical Secondary Education (PSE) student who will be missed by staff and students across the St Mary's community and we extend our deepest sympathy to her family and friends at this very sad time.' Tribute: Flowers have been left outside the house in New Malden, Surrey . Leeanne Muller, 18, from Wimbledon Chase, said: 'Rachel was bubbly and liked to talk - she was happy. 'She was enthusiastic about her future and used to tell me about how was going to be rich by doing what she loved doing. She liked rapping and playing sports. 'She used to talk about her son and how much she loved him and how she wanted him to have a good life. She was a very good mum. 'I've been her friend for a long time and used to look after Kai sometimes. He'll be devastated. 'I only found out what happened this morning and it's horrible, really shocking.'

"By . Associated Press . More than one third of Americans are being hounded by debt collectors over unpaid bills, a new study by the Urban Institute has revealed. These consumers fall behind on credit cards or hospital bills. Their mortgages, auto loans or student debt pile up, unpaid. Even past-due gym membership fees or cellphone contracts can end up with a collection agency, potentially hurting credit scores and job prospects, said Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank. 'Roughly, every third person you pass on the street is going to have debt in collections,' Ratcliffe said. 'It can tip employers' hiring decisions, or whether or not you get that apartment.' The study found that 35.1 percent of people with credit records had been reported to collections for debt that averaged $5,178, based on September 2013 records. Household debt had continued to plummet as Americans pay off their credit cards and shrink their mortgages after the recession . The study points to a disturbing trend: The share of Americans in collections has remained relatively constant, even as the country as a whole has whittled down the size of its credit card debt since the official end of the Great Recession in the middle of 2009. As a share of people's income, credit card debt has reached its lowest level in more than a decade, according to the American Bankers Association. People increasingly pay off balances each month. Just 2.44 percent of card accounts are overdue by 30 days or more, versus the 15-year average of 3.82 percent. Yet roughly the same percentage of people are still getting reported for unpaid bills, according to the Urban Institute study performed in conjunction with researchers from the Consumer Credit Research Institute. Their figures nearly match the 36.5 percent of people in collections reported by a 2004 Federal Reserve analysis. All of this has reshaped the economy. The collections industry employs 140,000 workers who recover $50 billion each year, according to a separate study published this year by the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia bank branch. The delinquent debt is overwhelmingly concentrated in Southern and Western states. Texas cities have a large share of their populations being reported to collection agencies: Dallas (44.3 percent); El Paso (44.4 percent), Houston (43.7 percent), McAllen (51.7 percent) and San Antonio (44.5 percent). Almost half of Las Vegas residents - many of whom bore the brunt of the housing bust that sparked the recession - have debt in collections. Other Southern cities have a disproportionate number of their people facing debt collectors, including Orlando and Jacksonville, Florida; Memphis, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi. Household debt payments are at a 30-year low - but more than one third of Americans are still behind on their bills . Other cities have populations that have largely managed to repay their bills on time. Just 20.1 percent of Minneapolis residents have debts in collection. Boston, Honolulu and San Jose, California, are similarly low. Only about 20 percent of Americans with credit records have any debt at all. Yet high debt levels don't always lead to more delinquencies, since the debt largely comes from mortgages. An average San Jose resident has $97,150 in total debt, with 84 percent of it tied to a mortgage.  But because incomes and real estate values are higher in the technology hub, those residents are less likely to be delinquent. By contrast, the average person in the Texas city of McAllen has only $23,546 in debt, yet more than half of the population has debt in collections, more than anywhere else in the United States. The Urban Institute's Ratcliffe said that stagnant incomes are key to why some parts of the country are struggling to repay their debt. Wages have barely kept up with inflation during the five-year recovery, according to Labor Department figures. And a separate measure by Wells Fargo found that after-tax income fell for the bottom 20 percent of earners during the same period.","35percent of Americans have been reported to collections agencies .

"By . Associated Press . A Connecticut teacher who helped save her 15 first-graders' lives during the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012 has signed a book deal. G.P. Putnam's Sons announced today that 'Choosing Hope: Moving Forward from Your Life's Darkest Hour' by teacher Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis, 30, will be released next spring. The publisher says the book will be a 'poignant account of personal triumph over unbearable tragedy.' Robin Gaby Fisher is co-writing it. Sandy Hook teacher Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis, who saved 15 first-graders in the massacre, has a book deal (pictured in her Connecticut home in December) Roig-DeBellis hurried 15 first-graders into a bathroom upon hearing gunfire at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012, saving their lives. The gunman, Adam Lanza, eventually shot himself to death after gunning down his mother, six teachers and 20 children. Last year, Roig-DeBellis founded Classes 4 Classes, a nonprofit that advocates teaching children that all lives are connected. After the massacre, Roig-DeBellis took almost a year off from teaching and said in December that it was still the first and last think she thinks of every day. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'I remember, in the days after, it was so hard to get out of bed. 'I just walked around singing Amazing Grace just over and over and over, because it was so incredibly hard. Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis said a year after the tragedy that it's still the first and last thing she thinks of every day . 'In my mind constantly is what my students went through, and I think about the lives that were lost. So it's not so much a realization that a year has passed. It truly is a constant, all the time.' The tragedy at Sandy Hook, among the most deadly school shootings in U.S. history, rocked the leafy, suburban town 70 miles northeast of New York City. Lanza, a 20-year-old loner who appeared to have had severe emotional problems, used guns that had been bought legally by his mother, Nancy. He killed her in her bed, then drove to the elementary school he had once attended, shooting his way in just as the school day was getting started. After the rampage, he shot himself. When he entered the school, Mrs Roig-DeBellis's class was seated in a circle, sharing their holiday traditions. Children pictured as they are led out of Sandy Hook Elementary School on the day of the shooting in December 2012 . 'I got up, I closed the door, I turned the lights off and I turned to my students and I said: 'We need to get into the bathroom - right now',' she said. The bathroom was not more than 3ft by 4ft, too small to even hold a sink. Children climbed on to the toilet, behind the toilet. One perched on the toilet paper dispenser. Mrs Roig-DeBellis used a storage unit to barricade the door. About 45 minutes later, when the police arrived, Mrs Roig-DeBellis would not let them in. For days after, she was in a daze, unsure if she was dead or alive. The shootings shocked the nation and led President Obama to propose a series of new gun-control measures, including an expansion of federal background-check laws. Those efforts were blocked in the U.S. Senate after some lawmakers argued the changes would be onerous to law-abiding gun owners.","Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis's book is titled Choosing Hope: Moving Forward from Your Life's Darkest Hour and will be released next spring .

"By . Eleanor Harding . and Nick Fagge . and Emily Davies . Taxpayers, MPs and councillors united last night to condemn the decision to spend £10,000 on flying lessons for a failed asylum-seeker. They said the decision was ‘plain wrong’ and ‘crazy’ when public services are being cut. The controversy centres on Yonas Admasu Kebede, 21, who is training to be a pilot despite a ruling that he must leave Britain next year.

Newcastle Council has to pay for his lessons after the Court of Appeal ruled it had a duty to meet his ‘education costs’ as he has no parents and had been taken into its care. Yesterday, it emerged that the authority has already spent £30,000 on the case and will also have to pay Mr Kebede’s costs. Councillors could now take the decision to the Supreme Court, which would incur further costs. Labour MP John Woodcock said: ‘This crazy ruling could signal open season for a run of indefensible claims. Asylum-seeker: The controversy centres on Yonas Admasu Kebede, 21, who is training to be a pilot despite a ruling that he must leave Britain next year .

Henry Gallagher said: ‘Flying lessons seems fairly extreme. The main city swimming pool has closed and there are libraries under threat.’ Fellow councillor Marc Donnelly said: ‘In times of limited public funds, we have to be extremely careful.’ There was also anger on Twitter last night from across the country.

"By . Monty Don . Today is the longest day and the summit of the year for us gardeners, filled with more light than any other. Increasingly, the plants that I enjoy most at this time of year are not the wonderful flowers in the borders but the umbellifers – a family of plants with long stems and flowers forming clusters called umbels – that catch the late evening light like lit, upturned chandeliers. They do not just look beautiful either. All umbellifers attract into the garden beneficial insects like ladybirds, hoverflies and lacewings, which in turn are your best defence against aphids. The plants that Monty enjoys most at this time of year are the umbellifers - a family of plants with long stems and flowers forming clusters called umbels . Birds too are attracted in autumn by the seeds, so they instantly enrich the wildlife of your garden. Q When should I trim my box hedge? Doreen Osborn, West Sussex . A Right now! The traditional date was Derby Day, which is at the end of the first week in June. In practice, this is after the risk of frost has safely passed, so depending where you live, any time between the beginning of May and end of June is ideal. This gives time for new growth to harden off before the autumn frosts. Q Half of my 25-year-old Leyland cypress 'Castlewellan' has turned brown. Is this a disease or old age? Jim Henry, Jedburgh, Scottish Borders . A It is not age – at 25 your plants  are babies – nor is  it disease. It is the cypress aphid, which sucks sap from the trees, causing the foliage to die back. The plants can recover and regrow – but often do not. The only solution is to cut the hedge down, grub out the roots and plant another, less vulnerable evergreen hedge such as yew.  Q The petals of my Camellia japonica, which lives in the porch, are turning brown. Why is this happening? Mrs M Wincott, Lancashire . A This could be petal blight, which is encouraged  by excess moisture and poor ventilation. If the petals first develop dark brown veins then this is an indication of blight. Or it could be sunscald caused by the sunlight being magnified by the glass  of the porch. A shadier location – ideally west-facing – would avoid this. Write to Monty Don at Weekend, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or email monty.don@dailymail.co.uk. Please include your full name and address. We regret Monty can't reply to letters personally . Many umbellifers add a tall, even stately element to the garden, whether growing in a border or 'wild' at the fringes. Mind you, some are taller than others. My White Garden that I made last year is based upon the spirit of cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris), which froths so gloriously along our verges in May. By now it has all but disappeared but there are plenty of good garden plants that capture its free, floating spirit. Ammi majus is perhaps the most exact garden version and it is at its very best right now. It is a biennial that is best sown in September, so it's a good idea to order your seeds now. Keep it over the winter with a bit of protection (a cold frame is ideal) and then plant it out in spring, when it will grow to about 1-1.3m (3-4ft) topped with clean white florets. The only drawback that I have so far discovered is that it can be irresistible to rabbits. Orlaya grandiflora, the white lace flower, is a superb and graceful annual with rather larger flower heads that can be sown either in spring for flowering in late summer or in September for an earlier display the following year.  It will flower continuously for about ten weeks so is excellent value in any border. Angelica grows huge on my damp, rich soil. It self-seeds vigorously so needs thinning if it is not to become too invasive, but in its right place it is an absolute joy. No plant is more popular with butterflies, hoverflies, bees and wasps than the lovely, plum-coloured umbellifer Angelica gigas. It starts out slowly, easing itself into summer with modest foliage, but in late July it throws up a 2m (6ft)-tall crimson stem topped with a beautiful bud that opens to reveal umbellifer flowers of the deepest burgundy. You can buy it to plant out now – it is monocarpic, which means that it dies back once it has set seed, but the seeds will produce a rash of seedlings that can be lifted and moved to wherever you wish to place them, so the plant can live on through its offspring for years. I grow Valeriana officinalis in a pot but it is a spectacular plant nevertheless, which deserves – and gets from me – pride of place. The white umbels are touched with pink and carried on tall, upright stems that last for months. The roots are apparently irresistible to cats and rats but the leaves are a sedative for humans. The common fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) exemplifies all the virtues of umbellifers: open, lacy, towering but not shading anything beneath it. The leaves are the perfect accompaniment to baked or barbecued fish and the seeds are delicious too, both rubbed into a joint of pork and to munch on by the handful. Good for the tummy too. Finally, one of my favourite umbellifers is sweet cicely (Myrrhis odorata), which grows in quite deep shade. As with fennel, you can buy it to plant out now, and all of it can be eaten, from root to flower to seed. It tastes of aniseed and is good cooked with tart fruits such as rhubarb or gooseberries because it reduces the acidity.","Monty's favourite plant at this time of year is the Umbellifer .

"By . Nick Fagge . It is a hard-fought game where players are taught not to shirk a tackle. But Rugby Union’s ruling body has been accused of going soft by trying to remove the competitive edge of the sport for children. It wants schools and clubs to switch players between sides at half-time to make games less one-sided and to ban trophies from tournaments for the under 11’s in order to stop disillusioned youngsters giving up. However attempts to introduce a more level playing field have backfired with one former England international pulling his club out of mini-rugby competitions. School of hard knocks. Rugby Union¿s ruling body has been accused of going soft by trying to remove the competitive edge of the sport for children. File picture . Simon Halliday, who was part of the England’s 1992 Five Nations Championship winning side, said: ‘Rugby is a lesson in life. ‘Nobody wants to see a young side get panned but if one team wins by 30 points you have to say “congratulations” and the other team goes off to lick its wounds and ask what went wrong.’ On Sunday mornings tens of thousands of youngsters play mini-rugby, using a smaller ball and playing on a smaller pitch. But the Rugby Football Union (RFU) is . concerned at the number of children who drop out in their teens instead . of graduating to the adult game. Try hard: Simon Halliday, who played for Bath and Harlequins, blasted the guidelines and said: 'You can¿t tell an eight-year-old that the result doesn¿t matter' It therefore is urging clubs to . concentrate on playing skills and enjoying being on the field rather . than the result. This in mind Surrey Rugby, one of RFU’s constituent bodies, has sent out new rules for a forthcoming min-club festival. Rival coaches have been told they must consult on the levels of their teams before a match and switch players at half-time if the score is too one-sided. Clubs have been warned they will be disciplined if they ignore the new guidelines. But two clubs - Esher, from Surrey, and Rosslyn Park, from south-west London, are so incensed they have pulled out of the tournament. Mr Halliday, who played for Bath and Harlequins, said: ‘I get the full gamut of trying to encourage children to play but you can’t tell an eight-year-old that the result doesn’t matter.’ However RFU development director Steve Grainger says it is more important to keep the children interested than meet the adult’s needs. He said: ‘This is not about denying children competitive rugby. Rugby is a competitive team sport and always will be and as a father myself I know how competitive children are. ‘But we must evolve a player-centred game which is enjoyable and allows young people to develop. ‘That is our Kids First Rugby programme, where the core skills are brought to the fore while maintaining the integrity of the sport as a game for all shapes and sizes.’","Sport chiefs want schools to remove some competitive aspects of game .

Sorrentino, 31, will take the classes for 12 weeks as part of a deal to resolve simple assault charges he faced following a June 15 fight with his brother Frank at their family's tanning salon in Middletown Township, New Jersey. A municipal court judge accepted the deal today and if Sorrentino successfully completes the counseling program, the charge against him could be downgraded. Scroll down for video . Mike Sorrentino (left) and his brother Frank (right) pictured arriving at court today in Middletown, New Jersey . Sorrentino's family, including his brother Frank, attended the hearing today in New Jersey. The reality star was arrested on June 15 at the salon, which is the setting for a new reality show about them. Police got a 911 call reporting what was described as a 'fist fight' between two people but only Sorrentino was detained, later emerging with a rather painful-looking black eye. The fight was between the star and his brother Frank and the 911 caller told police that she had to run out of the tanning salon to the UPS store next door when it broke out. A UPS employee next door could hear the siblings 'bouncing off the walls' during the punch up, TMZ reported. Mike told police that the brawl started after he and his brother argued over how their sunbed business should be run, according to TMZ. The reality star posted bail in the amount of $500 and was allowed to leave the police station in Middletown, soon after the arrest. Mike Pictured in June with a black eye after the brawl at his family tanning salon . It's been a difficult time for the family business, as TMZ reported that employee pay checks bounced in June. Sorrentino worked as an assistant manager of a fitness center in Staten Island before fame came calling. When he was 25, he lost this job and began underwear modelling, which led to a role in the smash hit MTV show. Mike has two older brothers, Frank and Marc; younger sister Melissa completes the siblings. Marc also serves as The Situation's manager and partner in MPS Entertainment. The cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore, filmed in Seaside Heights, were known for their love of tanning and the motto GTL, or gym, tan, laundry. They also were known for a rowdy, partying lifestyle that resulted in some cast members getting in fights and others facing legal troubles for alcohol-related incidents.","Mike Sorrentino, 31, agreed to the lessons today in court as part of a deal to downgrade simple assault charge .

"By . Scarlett Russell . Cara Delevigne may have dominated the headlines and social media over the past two years, but with her stunning looks and sought-after style, all eyes are moving to her older sister, Poppy. The middle Delevingne sister, 27, is an ambassador for Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld personally made her wedding dress when she married James Cook in May. A self-confessed party girl, Poppy now has as many photographers chasing her and designers flocking to her than her supermodel little sister - and is fast-becoming just as famous.

Poppy in particularly good friends with Karl Lagerfeld, who designed her wedding dress in May . In an interview with Giles Hattersley of Sunday Times Style, Poppy admits that she needs two rooms of her Notting Hill home to house all the clothes she is sent by top designers. Starting her modelling career at 18, she tells the publication that it was so easy to be overlooked that the way to make herself stand out, was to go out. 'I like to work all day and go out all night then, every couple of months, I crash,' says Poppy. 'It's quite shocking if 7pm rolls around and I've got no plans.' Despite being best friends with Sienna Miller (the two shared an apartment in New York) and having Superdry sponsor her hen party at Coachella music festival in California in April, when Poppy 'crashes' she does it just like the rest of us: with comfort food and TV.

'I need two days of lying in a bed large enough to swim in, eating cans of baked beans and watching 17 episodes of Friends,' she says. Socialite Poppy, whose father, Charles, is a successful property developer, had a privileged upbringing. Her elder sister is Chloe Delevingne, 29, who lives life a little less in front of the cameras than Cara and Poppy. Poppy grew up in a mansion in Belgravia and attended school at esteemed Bedales, where Daniel Day-Lewis, Minnie Driver and various Royals have been educated. A successful model, Poppy was signed to Storm by Sarah Dukas - the very same eye that spotted Kate Moss - in 2008. She has since modelled for Laura Ashley, Anya Hindmarch, Mango, Alberta Ferretti and Burberry, and walked for Julien Macdonald. She was the face of the Louis Vuitton summer 2012 collection, handpicked by Marc Jacobs himself.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Almost two million working young adults are still living with their parents because they cannot afford to move out, a report reveals today. A quarter of 20 to 34-year-olds who have a job are part of the 'clipped wing' generation, unable to fly the nest, housing charity Shelter warned. House prices are rising faster for first-time buyers than people already on the housing ladder, making it even harder for them to leave their family home. The 'clipped wing' hotspots include Castle Point in Essex where 45 per cent of working 20 to 34-year-olds live with their parents; Knowsley in Merseyside where the figure is 42 per cent; and Solihull where 38 per cent of young working adults still live in the home they grew up in . Census data shows that there are 1.97 million people aged 20-34 in England who are still living with their parents, accounting for one quarter of all young adults in employment. A survey commissioned by the Shelter also found that nearly half (48 per cent) of 250 young adults who live with their parents said they do so because they cannot afford to rent or buy their own home. Shelter said its analysis of the Census data uncovered several areas where the proportion of adult children living with their parents is much higher. It named nation's 'clipped wing' hotspots as Castle Point in Essex where 45 per cent of working 20 to 34-year-olds live with their parents; Knowsley in Merseyside where the figure is 42 per cent; and Solihull where 38 per cent of young working adults still live in the home they grew up in. There are 1.97 million people aged 20-34 in England who are still living with their parents, accounting for one quarter of all young adults in employment . Sarah, 32, lives with her parents in the family home in Croydon. She works in online advertising, but has been living on and off with her parents for the past 10 years while trying to save for a deposit. Sarah said: 'I'm trying really hard to save up and get my own place but today's rollercoaster house prices mean the goal posts keep moving. 'If I move out now the reality is I'll be stuck paying expensive rents for the rest of my life. 'I know I'm lucky to have a job and somewhere to live, but the thought that I'm going to be living like a teenager into my late 30s or even 40s is really disheartening.' Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: 'The ""clipped wing generation"" are finding themselves with no choice but to remain living with mum and dad well into adulthood, as they struggle to find a home of their own. 'Rather than pumping more money into schemes like Help to Buy, we need bolder action that will meet the demand for affordable homes and not inflate prices further. 'From helping small local builders find the finance they need, to investing in a new generation of part rent, part buy homes, the solutions to our housing shortage are there for the taking. 'Politicians of all parties must now put stable homes for the next generation at the top of the agenda.' Emma Reynolds, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: 'This research shows that the next generation is being priced out of home ownership. 'Unless we build many more affordable homes working people will be denied their dream of owning their own home. 'Yet under David Cameron house building has fallen to its lowest level in peacetime since the 1920s. 'Labour is clear that you can’t deal with the cost-of-living crisis without building more homes. That’s why Labour has committed to getting 200,000 homes a year built by 2020.' Latest figures show that house prices paid by first-time buyers are up 11.3 per cent year-on-year, compared to 10.7 per cent for people who already home a property. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that house prices paid by first-time buyers are up 11.3 per cent year-on-year, compared to 10.7 per cent for people who already home a property . Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'We’re determined to ensure anyone who works hard and wants to get on the property ladder has the help they need to do so. 'That’s why we’ve introduced Help to Buy, which has helped over 35,000 people to date get on the property ladder with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require. The scheme is also directly helping build new homes and increase housing supply, with private housebuilding up 34 per cent since the scheme’s launch. On top of this, we’re investing £1billion through our Build to Rent scheme to build new homes specifically for private rent. 'Our efforts have got Britain building, meaning that since 2010 we’ve delivered 445,000 newly-built homes – including nearly 200,000 new affordable homes.'","One in four people aged 20-34 in work are unable to leave family home .

Twelve-year-old Jason Montez and seven-year-old Noah were shot to death in their separate bedrooms. Thirty-five-year-old Heather Smith and four-year-old Lily Smith were shot in the parents' bed. Joel Smith's body was found on the floor nearby, the gun by his side. The children were shot dead while they slept, according to police. Scroll down for video .

The mother, her two sons and daughter were shot dead by her husband Joel Smith who then turned the gun on himself at the family's Maine home . Jason was Joel Smith's stepson and the other two are his biological children with Mrs Smith. Police said no suicide note was found, but investigators said the wife had told a family friend the night of the shooting that Joel Smith recently had threatened suicide. According to the Boston Herald, police said Smith put a gun to his head days before killing his family. Neither the 33-year-old or his wife sought help but she told a friend what he had done. Saco police Sgt. Chris Harriman also told the paper that the family spent time with friends at a barbecue earlier on Saturday. The friend later contacted an apartment complex worker to express concerns about the family's well-being, leading to the grisly discovery, investigators said. The family had domestic issues and financial problems, said Sgt. Christopher Harriman, a state police detective. A body is moved from a crime scene at an apartment complex where five members of a family, including three children, were found dead.

Heather Smith, a medical assistant, also was getting help for substance abuse, Ms Caruthers-Thorpe said. 'I know something had to have snapped because Joel never would have done that in his right mind,' she said. The Portland Press Herald reported that neighbors heard a sound 'like firecrackers' on Saturday night while one resident said he saw Joel Smith leaving the apartment on Sunday morning before returning.

The Collinsville water tower is a depiction of Brooks Old Original Rich and Tangy Catsup, which was once produced in the buildings beneath the tower. Now, the sign is for sale. Owner Larry Eckert is asking $500,000 for the 65-year-old, 170-foot-tall landmark and adjacent warehouse. For sale: A water tower shaped like a 170-foot-tall ketchup bottle is for sale in southern Illinois, along with an adjacent warehouse. Fans fear the 65-year-old landmark, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, might be in peril if a sympathetic buyer isn't found . Would you like fries with that? A water tower in the shape of a ketchup bottle is seen in Collinsville, Illinois . No Heinz here! The Collinsville water tower is a depiction of Brooks Old Original Rich and Tangy Catsup, which was once produced in the buildings beneath the tower . The landmark replicates a bottle of Brooks Old Original Rich and Tangy Catsup, which was produced in the buildings beneath the tower. The 100,000-gallon tower held water — never ketchup — and it hasn't been used since Brooks moved out in the early 1960s. The plant later became a warehouse used for shipping and trucking operations of Bethel-Eckert, which for four decades serviced military commissaries before losing its contracts. Larry Eckert, the owner, initially considered selling the ketchup bottle and warehouse separately, then decided one can't go without the other. Sauce not included: The sign is for sale. Owner Larry Eckert is asking $500,000 for the 65-year-old, 170-foot (52-meter)-tall landmark and adjacent warehouse . 'Whoever would be interested, you'd need the additional land anyway,' he said. Eckert said because the ketchup bottle is on the National Register of Historic Places, he expects the eventual buyer to preserve it. The 100,000-gallon tower never held ketchup. It hasn't been used since Brooks moved out in the 1960s. Judy Demoisy helped save the bottle when it was in danger of being torn down in 1993. She says preservationists believe using it in a ketchup museum would be great. 'It's a global condiment,' she says. Saucy: This October 1960 photo provided by Michael Gassmann, shows the iconic giant ketchup bottle water tower outside the old Brooks bottling plant in Collinsville, Illinois . Originally, the tower was used to supply water for catsup production and to run the plant's fire sprinkler system, but in the early 1960s, the Collinsville plant was closed and operations moved to Indiana. The plant was turned into a warehouse. But the bottle-shaped water tower remained. The tower fell into disrepair over the years before eventually being restored in 1995, thanks to a grassroots funding effort. At about that time the owners offered to donate the tower to the city of Collinsville. But city leaders at the time declined to take the gift. 'The administration at that time didn't get it,' Gassmann said. 'They didn't want anything to do with it, so the offer was declined.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Supermarkets are profiteering on fruit and vegetables, a food writer claimed yesterday. Joanna Blythman said she was shocked by the prices in big stores compared to the continent – where soft fruit, such as peaches, can cost as little as €1.50 (about £1.20) a kilo. In addition, she said that fruit and vegetables sold by independent traders can cost up to two-thirds less than supermarkets. Berry sneaky: Joanna Blythman said cherries, nectarines, blueberries are routinely overpriced in the UK . Miss Blythman, who wants an inquiry into fruit and vegetable pricing, told trade magazine The Grocer she had recently been to Italy, where peaches, apricots and nectarines sell for €1.50 to €2 (£1.60) a kilo and cherries for €2.50 (£2) to €5 (£4). ‘That’s for large, mature fruit, streaming with juice, not the puny, green specimens on UK shelves, where one solitary nectarine can knock you back a cool 69p each,’ she said. The food writer, from Edinburgh, said: 'Most people don’t analyse prices because supermarkets make it hard to do so. Summer berries come in odd-sized containers - 170g, 195g, 320g, for instance - at a pick-up price of £1.99 or £2.99. 'With all those irritating odd numbers, few of us will bother to do the maths.' 'This week, a £2.99 spend at my local greengrocer bought me exactly twice the weight of Spanish blueberries, Scottish raspberries and Italian cherry tomatoes that the nearest supermarket was offering.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . Fraud conviction: Stacey Tipler, 32, plundered public funds earmarked for lifesaving drugs while working in the accounts department of the Royal Marsden Hospital Trust in London . An NHS accounts worker who stole £640,000 from a cancer hospital's drugs fund and blew the cash on her wedding was jailed for four years today. Stacey Tipler, 32, of Carshalton, Surrey, plundered public funds earmarked for lifesaving drugs while working in the accounts department of the Royal Marsden Hospital Trust in central London. She diverted the money which was meant for hospital suppliers into bank accounts controlled by a gang of her accomplices, who then passed most of it back to her and her window-fitter fiancé, Scott Chaplin, 33. He was jailed for five and a half years. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court today Judge Anthony Leonard QC said Chaplin was the 'main instigator' but Tipler was 'invaluable' to the scam, which he said could had been 'catastrophic' for the hospital’s patients. He added: 'The skill which you showed in trying to ensure the fraud would go undiscovered was very great and very dishonest. It was a very clever but dishonest fraud.' The money was funnelled to the group of associates and mostly withdrawn as cash as part of a money laundering operation before the lion’s share was passed back to Chaplin. The couple maintained a 'cash reserve' to meet their bills and mortgage payments. They are also understood to have spent several thousand pounds on a deposit for a venue in Surrey for their proposed wedding, although the nuptials did not took place because Tipler was arrested a year before the big day . The gang members spent their share of the proceeds on mortgage payments and shopping sprees at luxury designers Gucci and Louis Vuitton. One spent £200 at the London Parachute School. At one point a drugs firm threatened to stop supplying the hospital with medication after failing to receive payment because of the scam, Southwark Crown Court heard. Because of an oversight by Tipler, the details of two of their co-defendants stayed in place of suppliers when payments were transferred to a central NHS system in April 2012. Judge Leonard said: 'The impact of the failure to reverse the scheme could have been catastrophic for the hospital patients because one of the drugs suppliers threatened to stop supplying vital medicines.' Mother of two Tipler betrayed no emotion as she was sentenced for her role in the fraud, which was uncovered by NHS investigators in May 2012. Money of varying amounts was passed to the accounts of Adrian Horan, 43, Clinton Woollery, 35, Thomas Quinlan, 26, Russell Baker, 32, and William Flynn, 37. Horan, of Sutton, Surrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to money launder. Going down: Scott Chaplin, 33, was jailed alongside Tipler, his partner of 16 years . Woollery, of Sutton; Quinlan, of Banstead, Surrey; Baker, of Worcester Park, Surrey, and Flynn, of Wallington, Surrey, admitted conspiracy to money launder. Another defendant, Roy Harriott, 31, of Sutton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to money launder after receiving a banker’s cheque worth £32,000. Horan was jailed for 21 months, Flynn for a year, Woollery for 10 months and Quinlan for eight months. Baker and Harriott were given suspended sentences of nine weeks and 12 weeks respectively. Kelly Matthews, a lawyer with the CPS’ Specialist Fraud Division, said: 'This was a sophisticated, large-scale fraud orchestrated to divert vital public funds for essential equipment and medicines at the Royal Marsden. 'Tipler and Chaplin bear the brunt of responsibility but they didn’t act alone. 'It was only with the others agreeing for their bank accounts to be used to launder the money that they were all able to benefit from the fraud. 'This was a selfish and gross misuse of public funds and today those responsible have been brought to justice.' Sue Frith, head of the National Investigation Service at NHS Protect, said: 'These custodial sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences and will act as a powerful deterrent to others. 'All suspicions of fraud reported to NHS Protect will be followed up and investigated wherever appropriate. We press for prosecution of offenders and seek the strongest possible sanctions.' Outside court: William Flynn, 37, who helped siphon the stolen cash away, was today jailed for a year . Southwark Crown Court had heard how Tipler was arrested after suspicious staff at suppliers Alliance Healthcare notified the NHS that the company had received two remittance slips with no accompanying payment. Tipler initially denied the scam but later admitted fiddling the accounts after claiming to have been threatened by two of her accomplices. She also said one of them had attacked Chaplin to put pressure on her. But Tipler's claims were rejected by the jury and she was convicted alongside Chaplin of masterminding the scam after a two-week trial. Prosecutor Anthony Hucklesby said: '[The hospital's] patients tend to have more complex types of cancer and this fraud targeted the supplies of essential cancer drugs to the hospital.' 'There was one stage that one of the main pharmaceutical suppliers threatened to stop supplying drugs to the hospital as a result of non-payment, which would have meant that patient treatment could not continue.' Jailed: Thomas Quinlan (left), 26, and Clinton Woollery (right), 35, were also both sent to prison today . Top cancer hospital: The money was intended to pay pharmaceutical suppliers to the Marsden, pictured . Leon . Kazakos, defending said: ‘She worked at the hospital for ten years in . roles where she was entrusted to perform functions in respect of money . and not once in those ten years was there any episode of dishonesty.’ He added that Tipler regretted carrying out the scams and would be parted from her two young children when in jail. Peter . Gray, defending Chaplin, admitted he was a ‘central figure’ in the . plot. 'There are those two young children, aged four years and nine . months,' he continued. 'He . has made his farewells to them and to say it has been a traumatic . matter for all concerned would probably be under expressing their . sentiments.' Investigators . have only been able to claw back around half of the stolen cash and the . Trust, one of the country’s leading cancer research centres, is still . around £310,000 out of pocket.

"By . Andrew Levy . Under pressure: Former shadow police minister David Ruffley was arrested and thrown in a cell before accepting a caution for common assault . A Tory MP is facing a crisis meeting about his future as anger mounts over an assault on his partner during an argument. Former shadow police minister David Ruffley was arrested and thrown in a cell before accepting a caution for common assault. Sources said his girlfriend at the time, Wendy Drew, called 999 when he flew into a rage and ordered her to leave his luxury flat in London. Details of the domestic violence incident emerged only last month, several weeks after it happened. Since then, he has faced calls from . church leaders, support groups and even political allies to step down as . MP for Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. His . local Conservative association has brought forward a meeting of its . executive from September 9 to July 31 and he faces a reselection battle . as he is grilled about his conduct. Critics include the Dean of St Edmondsbury Cathedral, who has written Mr Ruffley calling on him to consider his position. The Very Rev Frances Ward, a close friend of Mrs Drew, said he had lost the confidence of many of his supporters. Copies of the letter were sent to council leaders and new Government chief whip Michael Gove, among others. She said yesterday: ‘Everything I wished to say was contained within my letter and I would not wish to comment further.’ Jenny . Antill, a member of Suffolk Domestic Abuse Partnership and a Tory . county council cabinet member, said: ‘He is a part of a government who . has stood out firmly against domestic abuse in all its forms and I think . under those circumstances he really must consider his position.’ Another . senior local Tory, Joanna Spicer, who is responsible for health and . wellbeing in the county, accused the Conservative Party of ‘protecting . David Ruffley from the consequences of his police caution’. She added: ‘The Government published an excellent “Call for Action” on domestic violence only two years ago and has recently revised the action plan. ‘Their silence leads many people, including Conservative supporters, to conclude that they condone domestic violence.’ Cambridge-educated Mr Ruffley was a solicitor and an adviser to Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke before becoming an MP. He escaped with cuts and bruises after falling underneath a train in June 2010 following revelations about claims he made during the MPs’ expenses scandal including the purchase of a sofa and television. In an interview with the Daily Mail last year he admitted having a ‘bout of depression’ but said he had turned things around and ‘the best is yet to come’.

Four months after the brush with death at London’s Victoria station he met Irish-born Mrs Drew, 56, a portrait and landscape artist whose later husband was a wealthy property developer. He is now a member of the Treasury Select Committee and had been re-selected to fight his seat in 2015 before the incident in March at his luxury flat in Pimlico, a short distance from Westminster. Bury St Edmunds Conservative Association confirmed it had written to Mr Ruffley ‘requesting’ that he attend. Chairman Andrew Speed said the MP had always been due to attend the September meeting and other matters were due to be discussed. ‘This is not an “emergency” meeting. I’m sure members will want to ask David about the incident but we have other matters to deal with including how we will fight next year’s election.’ Mrs Drew was asked for a comment via her lawyers, Withers LLP, but there was no response. A close friend previously claimed she was ‘scared’ of her former partner, adding: ‘I think she stayed for fear of what he might do if she left. He treated her that badly.’ Mr Ruffley has so far refused to discuss the police caution and remained silent yesterday. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘This matter was investigated by the police and dealt with by them at the time.’","Tory MP David Ruffley was held and cautioned for common assault .

"By . Josh Ilan . Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko found time out on a visit to homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina to visit a fledgling football school. The 28-year-old went out of his way to make a trip to the Walter football school, which is located in his home city of Sarajevo. He is one of a few players who have gone to the place, with this including his nation’s captain and Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Emir Spahic. Surprise: Edin Dzeko returned to his home city Sarajevo, to meet local children at the Walter football school . The foundation was established in March 2011, with their website stating their aim is “to improve team skills, development of tolerance and fairness, as well as social competence.” During his visit, Dzeko posed for photographs with, and signed autographs for, the star-struck youngsters. In return, the institution gave the former Wolfsburg man a Brazuca, the official 2014 World Cup ball, as well as a painting. The forward attributed to his surprise visit there by retweeting a few photographs of him with the football school. Fine form: Scored 26 goals in all competitions for Man City last season as they regained the Premiership . The former Wolfsburg man also mentioned on the social networking site that he returned to watch his first professional club, FK Zeljeznicar Sarajevo, watching them go out on away goals to Metalurg Skopje in the second round of the Europa League after a 2-2 draw at home.Dzeko’s return to Bosnia represented a trip down memory lane, with the forward the only player in his country’s World Cup squad who stayed in Bosnian during its horrific Civil War from 1992 to 1995.

"By . Mike Dawes . Kevin Pietersen believes embattled England captain Alastair Cook is only still in the job because it would be a 'yet another PR disaster' for the England and Wales Cricket Board to sack him now. Pietersen has also urged Cook to relinquish the captaincy and seek emergency help for his batting - for the good of himself and England. Cook has found himself under increasing pressure both as skipper and as opener following a miserable run which has seen England lose seven of their last nine Tests and the 29-year-old score just 129 runs in nine attempts. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alastair Cook and his team play rugby before hitting the nets . Time to go? Kevin Pietersen believes only 'politics' are keeping Alastair Cook as still England captain . Critical: Pietersen thinks that the ECB will not sack Cook as captain as it would be a 'PR disaster' for them . The outspoken Pietersen, who was axed by England in February following the team's nightmare winter tour to Australia, feels Cook must now resign as captain and suggested it is only politics that are still keeping him in the role. Writing in his column in the Daily Telegraph, Pietersen said: 'At the moment only politics are keeping Cook in a job because the England and Wales Cricket Board backed him so much that it would be yet another PR disaster if it sacked him now. 'But the ECB needs his runs back more than anything else so a big decision has to be made. Forget the bad headlines for once.' The South Africa-born batsman does, though, believe Cook still has a lot to offer England if the left-hander can rediscover the form that has earned him a national record 25 Test centuries - two more than Pietersen. 'He should do what is right for England and resign the captaincy. He has shown he does not have the tactical brain to lead the side,' said Pietersen. Assistance: Pietersen says Cook (right) should give up the captaincy and seek emergency help for his batting . 'England badly miss Cook the opening batsman scoring 150 to set games up at the top of the order and, relieved of the captaincy, I don't think it is too late for him to rediscover this form. 'He could have another 10 years left but his batting requires emergency help and he needs to speak to someone away from the England set-up. He has to be honest with himself.' Pietersen feels Cook should seek advice from the many former internationals currently working as pundits, saying that is a valuable resource that is going to waste. He said: 'Cook needs people with experience of international cricket around him, which (England coaching team) Peter Moores and Paul Farbrace lack. 'Look at Marvan Atapattu working with Sri Lanka, Rahul Dravid with India, Shane Warne with Australia. How many ex-international players have England had recently working with them? None. There is so much knowledge in English cricket going to waste. 'There are so many great cricket brains in the Sky studios. Put that radio in your ear, listen to them on the balcony or in the dressing room and Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Warne or whoever could be saying something you didn't know and could implement in the game.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A World War Two veteran who faced celebrating his 88th birthday alone was overwhelmed when he received dozens of cards from strangers all over the world. Gene Moore, 88, had recently moved to a retirement home and was facing the prospect of a sad birthday with very few friends to celebrate with. His grandson, Jon Moore, 24, appealed to Reddit users to help him make his grandfather's birthday special after his grandmother Nola Moore, 85, said she was concerned that her husband would have a lonely day. Proud grandsons: Jon and Alex Moore put out an appeal after it appeared their WW2 veteran grandfather Gene would have a very lonely 88th birthday . The family were overwhelmed when nearly 40 cards and more than 300 emails from all over the world turned up in time for the octogenarian's birthday last week. Mr Moore, of Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, said: 'Last Christmas we had to move my grandfather into a nursing home because he needs daily medical attention. 'Even though he was just down the street it was hard for us to see him go, but even harder for my grandmother because he was all she had. 'They have been married for 66 years, so you can imagine how close they are. It's been hard for her.' Service: Gene Moore, right, pictured with a Navy friend while serving in WW2.  He was a Navy Postman on the USS John A. Bole . A couple of weeks before his grandfather's birthday Mr Moore, a software designer, saw a post on his Facebook page from his grandmother. He said: 'She asked if I would spread the word to see if we could get more friends and family to send him cards to make his birthday extra special.' Mr Moore posted on the popular link aggregation site Reddit urging people to send birthday cards to his grandfather for his birthday. Mr Moore said: 'No one in my family knew I was going to post it to Reddit, and no one anticipated the amazing response we got. Overwhelming response: Jon Moore reads some of the dozens of cards sent by well-wishers to his grandfather Gene as the family, including grandmother Nola, centre, celebrates with a birthday meal . Goodwill: Some of the many letters sent to the 88-year-old vet after his grandson launched an online appeal . 'I figured that if even two people sent cards, then my grandparents would be overjoyed. 'I compiled together some photos of my grandparents for the Reddit post, including one from his days in the Navy during World War Two. 'He was a Navy Postman on the USS John A. Bole, so it was almost ironic that the man who carried letters of love for so many people during the war was finally getting letters himself.' On July 22nd the family were overwhelmed when they found their letterbox stuffed with cards from Canada, Australia, Holland, China, California, Texas, and the UK wishing Gene Moore a happy 88th birthday. Mr Moore said: 'The cards all contained birthday wishes, local greetings from whatever exotic location they came from and photos and messages from people saying that my grandfather was lucky to have a loving family who cares about him. Many happy returns! Gene Moore blows out the candle on his birthday cake .

'I was shocked - I have seen what strangers on the Internet can do when they rally behind something, but I never expected it to affect me directly. 'It has been so amazing to see such genuine kindness from everyone - we were all surprised and absolutely thrilled.' Mr Moore said the unexpected well-wishing from around the world meant his grandfather had a very special birthday. Mr Moore said: 'My grampy was so happy. He is generally not the most emotive person in the world, but he loved seeing the letters. 'His strongest memories to date are those from when he travelled and served with the Navy, and being stationed in Shanghai. 'One of the letters we received was from someone in Shanghai who went to the old postal station building where he was stationed on land, took photos, had them printed, and sent them over with a very sweet letter.' Mr Moore barely had enough space in his nursing home room to display his impressive hoard of cards . Touching: The family were overwhelmed when they found their letterbox stuffed with cards from Canada, Australia, Holland, China, California, Texas, and the UK wishing Gene Moore a happy 88th birthday . Mr Moore added that his grandmother was thrilled to give her husband a memorable surprise. He said: 'She loves him dearly and it pains her to see him so lonely. She wants to give the world to him - I was trying to help her do just that. 'I told them the story of how I went about posting the photos online, showed them the comments, and read them the messages.

"By . Scarlett Russell . An increasing number of couples set to marry this year are asking friends and family to give them cash instead of wedding presents. Traditional gifts of toasters, microwaves and other household appliances are now seen as outdated, because the bride and groom have most likely already lived together for a number of years. Financial contributions are seen as more useful - and those who feel awkward asking for them are turning to the power of verse to do it for them. Cold hard cash: An increasing number of couples set to marry this year are asking friends and family to give them cash instead of wedding presents . Many couples are choosing to write a poem inside their wedding invitations to avoid the embarrassment of asking outright for money. One example reads: 'If you were thinking of giving a gift to help us on our way/A gift of money in a card would really make our day!' Would celebrities shun presents for cash? Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, pictured here on their wedding day in May . The findings come from wedding website confetti.co.uk, who surveyed 2,500 British couples and found that nearly four-fifths of those marrying this year will be asking for money instead of a gift. Kate Thompson, the website's features writer, told the Observer: ‘As lots of couples are paying for the wedding themselves, an extra cash injection is much more welcome. ‘Some couples still feel uneasy asking for money, however, so a growing number choose to say it with a poem.’ Sarah Crown, editor of the Mumsnet website, told the publication that the trend for asking for money instead of gifts has been growing steadily for years and that readers on the forum have divided opinions. ‘Our users are fairly split,’ she says. ‘Many think it's rude, while plenty of others think it makes life much easier.’ One Mumsnet member reacted particularly critically to the trend and posted her own response to the ‘vomit-inducing’ poem. ‘I wonder if anyone's ever replied in kind?’ She asks, continuing: ‘So happy for you on your special day/We hope great joy will come your way/And, while we know that others may/Choose to mark your wedding day/By giving you money for your pot/We thought that we had better not/We hunted low and hunted high/For a special gift to remember us by/And so we hope you will adore/This special, useful ironing board.’","Four fifths of couples marrying this year will ask for a financial contribution .

"By . Darren Boyle . A man has been jailed after his Jack Russell dog Scrappy terrorised neighbours - in a place called Mutley. Leslie Hodgson, 48, from Plymouth, Devon, allowed the small dog to bite several of his neighbours as well as allowing the dog to attack two police officers. Despite its size the dog, named after  Scooby Doo's little sidekick, already had a fearsome reputation in the Mutley area of Plymouth. Leslie Hodgson, left, was jailed for three months after Plymouth Magistrates' court heard that he had allowed his Jack Russell Scrappy, (file picture),  attack his teenage neighbour at his home in Mutley in Plymouth . During the latest incident Hodgson made no attempt to control the dog and left his door wide open as he drank inside his flat on May 28, Plymouth Magistrates' Court heard. The Jack Russell raced outside and started barking and snarling at a teenage neighbour and his sister. As the 16-year-old shielded his sibling, Scrappy dug his teeth into the teenager's ankle, tearing through his jeans and leaving him with a bloody wound. The court heard heard the boy was eventually able to shake the dog off and was taken to hospital where he had a tetanus jab. Hodgson admitted being the owner of a dog which injured someone while dangerously out of control in public. But his jail sentence was reduced from six months to three because of his guilty plea. The court ordered Scrappy to be destroyed. The series of attacks took place in the Mutley area of Plymouth in Devon, pictured . A statement read out from a Devon and Cornwall Police officer said: 'Serious injury could be caused to other members of the public and young children. 'The dog is relatively small in size but has shown it is able to cause injury and I consider the dog to be a danger to the public.' The court heard the dog had already bitten another man and two police officers in previous incidents. Hodgson had received received a visit from Plymouth City Council’s dog warden and his neighbours had demanded the dog’s destruction. The teenage victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had said previously: 'I was just trying to protect my sister. 'I love my family and I would do anything for them. It was quite painful and it is painful still.' Jodi Barker, defending, said on one occasion when the dog got loose Hodgson had collapsed due to illness and was unable to stop it. She said: 'He is really fond of this animal and he is his reason for going out. He feels the dog’s behaviour has been a direct result of his actions and the dog is not a danger. 'He feels bad about the dog being destroyed as a result of his ability to not care for it properly.' District judge Kevin Gray said: 'This was a situation where a dog had clearly bitten people before. It was not under any form of control. A young person was given hospital treatment. 'Given what I have heard about the dog and your ability to look after it, I will issue a destruction order.' It’s against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control anywhere including the owner's house, a private garden or in public. A dog is classed as being dangerously out of control if it either injures somebody or causes them fear that they may be injured. All types of dogs - even if they are not banned - are covered by the law. Upon prosecution, owners can be fined up to £5,000 and sent to prison for up to six months. Owners can be banned from owning dogs in future and in many cases the animal can be destroyed. In more serious cases, where a dog injures somebody, an owner can be sent to prison for five years. If an owner deliberately sets their dog on somebody they can be charged with 'malicious wounding'. Killing someone with your dog can attract a 14-year jail term and an unlimited fine. Allowing a dog to attack a guide dog is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine.","Leslie Hodgson was drinking beer as his dog attacked his young neighbour .

"By . Mark Prigg . A new gadget can turn your phone in a 'walkie talkie' - even if you have no phone coverage. The goTenna uses radio waves to communicate over 50 miles. If both people have a device, they can messages each other and send their location, complete with a map. Scroll down for video . The $199 for two gadget contains a large antenna that creates a low power radio network. Using a special app users can message each other and share their location. The device pairs wirelessly over BluetoothLE to the goTenna app (available on iOS and Android). It then allows you to send and receive text messages and share GPS locations and maps via low-frequency radio-waves over relatively high range (up to 50 miles). The goTenna app has automatic message retry and will let you know when your message has been delivered to the intended recipient. It will last for 72 hours on a full charge, and has a standby time of 150 days. The gadget also creates a 'mesh' network among users, allowing the range to be extended. The firm says the gadget is perfect for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, and even for families who travel a lot - who can use it abroad without paying roaming charges. 'goTenna allows you to communicate privately, free of subscriptions or fees, and is designed to beas rugged and resilient as its users,' the firm said. The idea came to Brooklyn brother and sister team Daniela and Jorge Perdomo during Hurricane Sandy when over a quarter of cell towers were downed. 'Our mission is twofold: to let people communicate whenever and wherever they want, on their own terms, and also to make sure that in times of a true emergency, people are able to reach others around them,' said Daniela Perdomo, CEO of goTenna. With goTenna, you can send messages to anyone within range of you who alsohas the device - which the firm says is key during an emergency. The gadget can easily be attached to a backpack, allowing hikers to take it everywhere with them . 'When you need to reach someone around you, simply send a 'shout' to another goTenna user,' it says. 'We’ve all been there: whether it’s during a hike, at a crowded concert, or traveling abroad, at times when we most need to stay connected to our group, we are faced with unreliable or unaffordable cell service.' The device pairs wirelessly over BluetoothLE to the goTenna app (available on iOS and Android).

"By . Barbara Preston, The Conversation . Students who went to state school do better at university than private school graduates with the same end-of-term exam scores. That’s the clear finding in a number of Australian studies since the 1980s, and in England since the 1990s. And it seems the differences between graduates of state and private schools is substantial. English results for graduates of independent schools and all categories of state schools, showing percentages that received an upper second or better degree by A-level achievement at the end of school . The most recent English research tracked all students who completed the end-of-school A-levels and went directly on to complete a full-time four-year degree course. The Australian research found that, on average, graduates of state schools received the same marks at the end of first-year university as graduates of private schools who had tertiary entrance scores around three to six points higher. The English research found that at each A-level standard, on average around seven percentage points more graduates of state schools than graduates of private schools received first or second-class, first division (upper second) honours. The English research found that at each A-level standard, on average around seven percentage points more graduates of state schools than graduates of private schools, such as David Cameron . English results for graduates of independent schools and all categories of state schools, showing percentages that received an upper second or better degree by A-level achievement at the end of school. Research in both Australia and England also found that with the same tertiary entrance scores graduates of co-educational schools tend to do better than graduates of single-sex schools. Graduates of lower-fee private schools (in Australia, Catholic schools) tend to do better than graduates of higher-fee private schools (in Australia, independent schools) And graduates of (English) state comprehensive schools do better (to a small extent) than graduates of state selective schools. The general finding is that graduates of non-elite and co-educational schools do better at university than graduates of socially and academically elite and single-sex schools who achieved the same tertiary entrance score. Independent private schools have similar shares of enrolments in the final school year in Australia and the UK, but the state sector has a smaller share in Australia due to the large private Catholic sector . Independent private schools have similar shares of enrolments in the final school year in Australia and the UK, but the state sector has a smaller share in Australia due to the large private Catholic sector, . Research in both Australia and England also found that with the same tertiary entrance scores graduates of co-educational schools tend to do better than graduates of single-sex schools. Graduates of lower-fee private schools (in Australia, Catholic schools) tend to do better than graduates of higher-fee private schools (in Australia, independent schools) And graduates of (English) state comprehensive schools do better (to a small extent) than graduates of state selective schools. The general finding is that graduates of non-elite and co-educational schools do better at university than graduates of socially and academically elite and single-sex schools who achieved the same tertiary entrance score. So what can explain this difference? There are no definitive explanations for these findings, though there is some attempt in the literature, some indicative data, and much informed speculation. And there is, of course, great variation among individual students – and among schools, universities and university courses. Explanations tend to focus on aspects of secondary schooling and on students’ effort levels at university, and any may be involved in particular cases. Preparation for the end-of-school assessments in private schools, relative to state schools, boosts tertiary entrance results above 'underlying ability', and graduates regress to 'underlying ability' level at university. Preparation for life and learning beyond school in private schools (and single-sex schools) relative to state schools (and co-educational schools) is poor, resulting in university performance below 'underlying ability'. Graduates of private schools make less effort at university because of perceived long-term advantages of their secondary schooling and other socio-cultural reasons. It appears a reasonable assumption that tertiary entrance scores are boosted by a better quality of education at high fee private schools. Fee-based resources several times greater than those of state schools can fund smaller classes and other ways to enhance learning. One explanation could be that graduates of private schools (pictured) make less effort at university because of perceived long-term advantages of their secondary schooling and other socio-cultural reasons . In addition, selection and exclusion practices can ensure an academic atmosphere not disturbed by disruptive, difficult-to-teach students, or even students without high academic aspirations. However, there appears to be contrary evidence: state school students tend to do better in NAPLAN tests than private school students at schools of similar socio-economic status (especially at higher socio-economic levels), according to data on the My School website analysed by researchers Bernie Shepherd and Chris Bonnor for a forthcoming publication. Thus other explanations are likely. One involves a narrow focus on tertiary entrance results at many elite schools. Tertiary entrance results are a central aspect of the status and marketing of high-fee private schools – supported by high-visibility league tables and human interest stories in the media. High pressure, close supervision and narrowly defined learning leave little room for independent, self-motivated learning, and developing the personal and social skills required for success at university. Single-sex school cultures and practices may not prepare students well for university life. This is hinted at in the literature, but was 'obvious' for a recent university graduate I spoke to who attended both single-sex and co-educational secondary schools and said many single-sex school graduates 'do not learn to socialise at school, and when they get to uni they just party'. Research in both Australia and England also found that with the same tertiary entrance scores graduates of co-educational schools tend to do better than graduates of single-sex schools . What are the implications? The government has set its sights on a highly differentiated fee and scholarship regime for higher education. Graduates of many universities are likely to have debts of over $100,000 (£54,900) for popular and socially important courses such as science, and debts of over $250,000 (£137,100) for longer courses such as veterinary science. Universities with high-demand courses and high fees will need fairer criteria for access to all courses and for the awarding of all scholarships based on entry-level academic merit. This is not just a matter of justice for individuals, but also for our future as a well-educated, productive and fair society. English education commentator Nick Morrison suggested that the disparity between state and private school graduates’ success at university should provoke fee-paying schools to question whether they are doing all they can to equip students for university. The Australian Financial Review recently urged people to 'do the sums on the true cost of private schools'. It’s apparent that high private school fees may not be buying effective education. In the context of university debts upwards of $100,000 (£54,900), families should 'do the sums' on comparable expenditure on schooling. Barbara Preston is a PhD candidate for Education, Science, Technology & Mathematics Faculty at University of Canberra. This piece originally appeared in The Conversation.","This is according to 1980 and 90s studies in Australia and England .

"By . Dr Ranjana Srivastava . It's the word that no-one wants to hear - and a diagnosis which changes your life in seconds. But the reality is that half of all Australian men and a third of women will be affected by cancer by the age of 84. In 2014, more than 128,000 Australians are expected to be diagnosed with cancer. For every one of those people, there is a network of partners, friends and family who hope to support the patient as best as they can. At what is a confusing and overwhelming time, medical oncologist Dr RANJANA SRIVASTAVA's new book So It's Cancer: Now What? is designed to guide people through the battle of their lives. She uses the experiences of those who have gone through cancer to give tips and advice that may not have even occurred to the sufferer, but could make all the difference. Here, she offers advice to patients, family and friends who are dealing with the shock of a cancer diagnosis. Dr Ranjana Srivastava has written a book to help assist cancer patients and their loved ones, right from the moment of diagnosis . If you are the patient… . Avoid panicking although this is easier said than done. The very mention of cancer inspires fear but these days, many early cancers have a very good prognosis, allowing patients to lead a normal life after adequate treatment. For example, breast cancers detected via screening mammogram are typically small and operable. There is a swirling debate about prostate cancer screening because it is thought that many patients, especially older men, die with prostate cancer rather than of it. Bowel cancer screening has led to a reduction in deaths. In turn, many non-malignant conditions such as severe heart failure, kidney disease or end-stage emphysema have a poorer prognosis than cancer. Cancer survival rates continue to improve and a person diagnosed today has a better than ever chance of survival. Sixty-five per cent of cancer patients can expect to survive for the next five years, with the survival rate having risen by an impressive thirty per cent in the past two decades. Renew your relationship with your GP or find one. A cancer patient may meet several kinds of doctors including a GP, medical oncologist, surgeon and radiation oncologist. Of these, the relationship with the first two is often the longest for many patients. A good GP with whom you share a rapport and understanding can be the lynchpin of your medical journey. He or she can refer you to capable and considerate specialists, organize tests and serve as a valuable sounding board. Your GP, another specialist or the hospital system will usually refer you to an oncologist. The tips in the book hope to make cancer sufferers feel less overwhelmed when dealing with their diagnosis and treatment . Take time to find a suitable oncologist and take the trouble to understand your diagnosis and its implications. Cancer does not develop in a single day or a week – it is typically something that grows over months. Hence, avoid the natural instinct to seek next-day treatment, knowing that in most instances, it’s okay and indeed, important, to order your thoughts, make a list of priorities, and find the right doctor for you. It is vital that you feel able to talk to your oncologist because cancer treatment is complicated but also nuanced. A mutual feeling of respect and understanding are important considerations as is empathy. It pays to heed word-of-mouth recommendations. It’s also a good idea to think about what kind of doctor suits your needs. Some patients are content with an oncologist who can give them straight medical advice and they seek emotional support elsewhere. Other patients want their oncologist to offer more holistic care. Some patients are quite comfortable with the oncologist making all the decisions while others prefer a collaborative approach. Don’t feel disadvantaged by a perceived lack of education or sophistication to engage with a specialist. Part of a doctor’s job is to demystify medicine and bring you along. This means speaking to you in a language that you can understand. Expect plain-language and honest explanations to your questions and ask for information in writing where possible so you can read it in your own time. The flip side of demanding honesty is that you must be prepared for bad news from time to time, but as long as this is addressed in a helpful and considered manner, you are usually better off learning the bad news. Dr Srivastava tells cancer patients to ask their doctor to give a written version of any information, so the patient can go home and read it again in their own time . If you are the spouse or partner of a cancer patient… . Cancer doesn’t just affect the individual but also the family. Partners can suffer no less acutely as they try to help the patient while managing their own emotions. Allow the patient some space to reconcile to the shock of the diagnosis. Even people who usually share everything can become withdrawn, leading partners to feel frustrated that they are being shut out. From the patient’s perspective there is the struggle to make sense of the upheaval and the obligation to shield loved ones from worry. If you are feeling left out, urge yourself to practice patience and understanding. Make known that you are available but also be respectful of personal space. Cancer patients quickly become disempowered as they enter the healthcare maze. Everyone tells them what to do and when to do it. The greatest gift you can give your partner is your quiet support and a ready ear. Dr Srisvastava's new book is a guide to the fight of your life . When you are a friend of a cancer patient… . Even though you’re desperate to help it isn’t uncommon, especially in the early stages, to feel as if your help is not welcome or that you are being intrusive. Sadly, many friendships fall victim to cancer because of mismatched expectations and often, the sheer practicality of trying to keep relationships alive when you are in the battle of your life. Not everyone wants to share bad or confronting news with others. Some patients don’t want to be perceived as needy while others are merely protective of their friends. People feel ready to talk at different junctures of an illness. And frankly, many patients are simply too exhausted to analyse these things too much. Something many patients have told me is that they find it tiring, and even disheartening, to be constantly asked by good friends if there is anything they can do. Many patients prefer that their friend took stock of what they need and just did it. Small and regular acts of kindness and consideration matter far more than a large burst of generosity followed by awkward silence. Join a roster for preparing meals, fold the laundry, pick up a patient’s children from school, mow the lawns – these routines don’t stop when someone has cancer and a good friend will rearrange commitments to take care of the boring stuff. A potent theme for cancer patients is abandonment so don’t underestimate the value of just being there even if you feel you are not doing anything important. Offer to drive the patient to an appointment or simply sit next to the chemotherapy chair. Cancer is typically a drawn-out experience with several ups and downs. With modern medicine, the future appears optimistic. If you are a patient take heart from this. If you are a concerned partner, your supportive presence could be the greatest gift. If you are a worried friend, recognize the value of small, seemingly insignificant acts of kindness that are anything but.

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple's iWatch could be the firm's next smash hit and sell 60 million units within a year, a leading analyst has claimed. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty says the watch, expected to cost around $300, will sell between 30 and 60 million units. She believes it could sell as many units as Apple's smash hit iPad, and far more than the iPhone in its first year. Scroll down for video . Dubbed the Diet Watch, Vreynhoef believes that future models of smartwatch, including Apple¿s much-rumoured device (concept image pictured) could automatically track calories throughout the day . Speculation . around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release . date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. The analyst says Apple's 'halo' effect will drive sales, and outlined three scenarios for sales. In the 'base case,' the iWatch follows the iPhone’s adoption trajectory, selling 30 million units in the first 12 months at $300 apiece, generating an extra $9 billion in revenue and adding 49 cents to Apple’s bottom line. In the 'bull case, the iWatch follows the iPad’s trajectory, selling 60 million units and the stock hits $132 per share by this time next year. There's also a worst case 'bear' scenario where iPhone sales go flat, mainstream consumers lose interest in wearables and Apple’s share price falls to $74. Earlier this week it was claimed Apple's iWatch has been delayed and will not begin mass production until November, it has been claimed. It is believed the firm has delayed the watch to ensure the hardware and software is perfect at launch. However, it is believed the firm could still announce the device in October at a special event. In a research note obtained by AppleInsider, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the iWatch represents a new level of difficulty for Apple in regard to both hardware and software development. 'Kuo estimates Apple will push back mass production to mid- or late-November, one month later than previous models claiming large-scale manufacturing would start in late-September,' the site claims. 'With only a few supplier ramping up ahead of an anticipated October release, supplies of the wearable will be constrained and are unlikely to meet market expectations of 10 million shipped units by the end of 2014. 'Instead, Kuo says about 3 million iWatches will be in the wild by year's end.' Apple recently  poached a senior executive from Swiss luxury watch brand Tag Heuer, which could be to help it with the launch of its iWatch expected this autumn. Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant (pictured) was spotted on Apple's Cupertino campus last month, and is believed to have met Apple's design boss Jony Ive and his team to discuss upcoming products - including the iWatch. Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple. It did not say what his new job would be, and Apple declined to comment. Jean-Claude Biver, head of watch brands at LVMH and chairman of watch brand Hublot, said he believed the threat of smart watches had to be taken seriously by the Swiss watch industry. 'The iWatch will have the same status symbol power as many other Apple products, especially at the beginning,' he said. 'I personally believe it has the potential to be a threat for the industry, and it should not stay with its arms crossed.' Apple applied for a trademark for the ""iWatch"" in Japan, a patent official said earlier this week, signaling the iPhone maker could be moving ahead with plans to launch a watch-like device soon. Google announcement comes just a week after sources revealed Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October. Pictured is a concept design of what the iWatch may look like . Speculation has been mounting that Apple was preparing to launch an iWatch which would include multiple health and fitness sensors and access to features such as messages and notifications through integration with the iPhone and iPad. A sweat sensor is believed to one of at least 10 sensors on the watch. It has also been revealed Apple has signed up a host of sports star to try the wearable - including basketball star Kobe Brant, who was recently spotted at Apple's Cupertino campus. According to laoyaoba.com, the sweat sensor has been developed in house by Apple. Although the watch is shrouded in secrecy, players from the MLB, NHL and NBA have believed to have been approached about the fitness aspects of the watch. One of these athletes is reportedly Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant, who was spotted on Apple's Cupertino campus last month. According to 9to5Mac's source, Bryant met Apple's design boss Jony Ive and his team, to discuss upcoming products. Apple is also believed to be working with Los Angeles Kings' Dustin Brown and an unnamed player from the Boston Red Sox, according to 9to5Mac. However,  laoyaoba.com also claims the watch may be delayed as it must be certified as a medical device with the Food and Drug Administration. Apple has already revealed it is working with Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and the National Institutes of Health on its HealthKit app, which is believed to work in tandem with the iWatch. Earlier reports say the watch will includes more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data. It is also set to come in multiple sizes - and is expected to go on sale in October. The much rumoured watch is believed to be about to begin mass production in Taiwan. The Wall Street Journal also said that Apple is planning multiple screen sizes for the device, and previous rumour have claimed a male and female version will be released. Rumours still differ as to whether the watch will be round or rectangular.","Morgan Stanley report claims watch will cost just $300 .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A New Jersey animal rescuer was indicted Monday for animal cruelty after police said she hoarded hundreds of pigeons, small mammals, turtles and other creatures in her 95-year-old mother's $1 million home only to let them starve and die. Authorities said the smell has horrific in the Little Silver home where Gretchen Rell allegedly had the decomposed creatures stacked five-feet high unbeknownst to her mother, who she told to 'never go into the basement.' Many of the animals that Rell, a 20-plus year volunteer at the Monmouth County SPCA, left to wither in the home and garage were still sealed in their original carrying crates. Unsettling: Gretchen Rell, a volunteer animal rescuer from Ocean Township, New Jersey, was indicted on Monday on charges she hoarded over 300 birds, reptiles, and mammals in her mother's $1 million home only to let them wither away and die . 'Never go in the basement': Authorities say they found animals stacked 5-feet-high from floor to ceiling in the basement of her mother's home, where she warned her never to go . Authorities first discovered the stomach-turning stash of creatures back in March, when they arrested Rell. 'We have more than 300 animals and counting,' Monmouth SPCA's chief law officer Victor Amato told the Asbury Park Press. 'Ninety-nine percent are dead birds. Most of them are seagulls, pigeons, robins, wrens and loons.' Investigators say they also found turtles, mice, rabbits, possums and other mammals too decomposed to identify 'stacked from floor to ceiling, five feet high,' according to Amato. Rell's LinkedIn account lists her occupation as MCSPCA Wildlife Coordinator since April 1992. 'I am in charge of placing injured or orphaned wildlife with State Licensed Wildlife Rehabilitators,' Rell writes in the job description. 'I am also in charge of transportation to those rehabbers and facilities.' Authorities . say that instead of following through with her job and getting the sick . and injured animals treatment, she took them home and allowed them to . dehydrate, starve and perish. Rell . was once seen by a number chasing down and capturing an injured seagull . on her mother's street, one neighbor told the Asbury Park Press. Area . children were also known take injured animals to Rell. Some . neighbors had begun to wonder what Rell was really up to by the time of . her March arrest and there were complaints of smells coming from her . mother's home. Gretchen Rell, 56, pleaded guilty on Monday to hoarding the carcasses of hundreds of animals at her 95-year-old mother's New Jersey home. She will be sentenced to probation and undergo mental health treatment . Sinking ark: The home contained the decomposing bodies of mostly pigeons but also contained various seabirds and ducks, possums, rabbits and mice--many of them in their original sealed crates from a rescue organization . Indicted: Friends called her the pigeon whisperer and her mother's neighbors even once saw her chase an injured seagull down the block, but as of Monday she's been charged with two counts of third degree animal cruelty . So how did she get away with hoarding so many creatures for so long? 'To be honest,' said Amato, 'when you were upstairs, you could smell a slight odor. It wouldn't be what you would expect with 300 dead animals.' Rell's own residence, where she lives with her husband, is in nearby Ocean Township. Authorities visited that residence and say they found 60 additional animals. On Monday, Rell was indicted in Ocean Township on two counts of third-degree animal cruelty, rerports Philly.com. The maximum possible sentence for the counts is five years behind bars. But even her accusers likely won't push for such a punishment. 'Gretchen was well intended. She is a nice person,' Amato told the Asbury Park Press in March. 'But what happens is they get overwhelmed and don't know how to ask for help. They get carried away. It's hoarding, no matter what.'","Gretchen Rell, 56, was arrested in March when police found the creatures stacked five feet high in the home in posh Little Silver, New Jersey .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . The return of the traditional A-level was heralded yesterday in figures showing a surge in teenagers choosing to study history, geography, languages and maths. Advance data issued ahead of A-level results next month shows that rising numbers of new entrants to sixth-forms are opting for core academic disciplines. The number of 17-year-olds taking geography has shot up 17 per cent while demand for history has leapt 14 per cent. David Cameron may have demoted Michael Gove from his job as education secretary but his legacy is pupils taking 'serious' A levels . The resurgence of traditional subjects follows the introduction of new-style school league tables aimed at promoting disciplines seen as valuable by universities and employers. Schools were previously able to score well in the tables without entering pupils for many traditional academic GCSEs, prompting some to favour ‘mickey mouse’ courses to rack up points. But former education secretary Michael Gove brought in a new ‘English Baccalaureate’ (EBacc) which rewards schools for entering pupils for six core GCSEs - English, maths, two sciences, a language and history or geography. The impact of the initiative on A-level choices is being seen for the first time, according to figures from the Joint Council for Qualifications, representing exam boards. Michael Gove brought in a new ‘English Baccalaureate’ (EBacc) which rewards schools for entering pupils for six core GCSEs - English, maths, two sciences, a language and history or geograph . The number of pupils taking AS-levels – which are halfway towards a full A-level – in history rose 14 per cent from 71,669 in 2013 to 81,843 this summer, while entrants for AS geography went up 17 per cent to 55,958 and Spanish 15 per cent to 14,089. Maths saw an increase of 7.1 per cent in entries and physics 4.5 per cent, with smaller rises in French and German. The JCQ said the trends may be partly down to changes to exams this year including the cancellation of the A-level resit opportunity in January, which is thought to have led to more candidates retaking in June instead. But it added: ‘Despite this, the dramatic increases in some subjects compared with others point to a large number of candidates sitting the subjects for the first time.’ It went on: ‘Of particular interest in these data is the significant increase in AS entries for geography, history and Spanish (16.9 per cent; 14.2 per cent; 14.8 per cent). ‘French and German entries also increased with French, German and Spanish combined rising 6.1 per cent and all modern foreign languages rising 5.6 per cent. The number of pupils taking AS-levels – which are halfway towards a full A-level – in history rose 14 per cent from 71,669 in 2013 to 81,843 this summer . ‘In fact, AS entries for all EBacc subjects have increased.’ The JCQ said it believed the figures ‘point to the EBacc influencing student and centre [school and college] choices’. Choices at AS-level usually have a strong bearing on the subjects taken to full A-level, with most pupils carrying on with their AS-level subjects. Figures for entries to full A-level this summer – before the ‘EBacc effect’ has worked its way through - show modest increases in the numbers taking maths, further maths, chemistry, physics and geography. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said that while the trends were positive, the figures have been rising from a very low base. In physics, A-level entrants had slumped to 27,368 in 2006 and although demand had now recovered to 36,862, it was still far below levels of 30 years ago. ‘In 1982, there were around 55,700 sitting physics. So although there has been a recovery, it has to be seen against that background,’ he said. The figures were released amid major changes to the exam system including a crackdown on resits and the return of end-of-course exams. The exam watchdog Ofqual last month wrote to head teachers warning them of ‘more variability’ in results in 2014 compared with previous years because of this year’s reforms. Ofqual warned that pupils ‘who have not had the opportunity to re-sit will generally do less well’. While headline results will be kept broadly in line with previous years, results at individual schools will vary more widely than usual. This year’s results day is Thursday August 14. Among trends already emerging are a drop in the number of pupils collecting A-level results in English this summer. Numbers are down 4.4 per cent, from 90,007 in 2013 to 86,036. It follows a grading fiasco at GCSE level two years ago which stemmed from a redesign of GCSEs by the last Labour administration. It broke courses down into modules and allowed teachers to mark large chunks of them through so-called ‘controlled assessment’. But over-generous marking by teachers led to grade boundaries in English having to be raised at the last minute. After a High Court challenge brought by an alliance of pupils, schools and councils, judges ruled that pupils were treated unfairly but that Ofqual and the exam boards did not act unlawfully. Malcolm Trobe, the deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘There’s quite clearly some indication of an unexpected drop in entries to A-level English, which of course coincides with the issues in 2012 to do with GCSE results in English. ‘It looks as if English entries have gone back up again for AS-level in 2014, which would indicate that there was a drop in those taking English, which would in all probability be linked to what happened in 2012. ‘Although a great deal was made at the time of the effect of the C/D grade boundary, it also impacted across the grade range.’ The figures also showed a decline of 2.4 per cent in the total number of A-levels taken this year despite a small rise in the population of 18-year-olds and an upturn in university applications. The JCQ said it had so far only analysed ‘high level’ data and could not say whether the trend was down to teenagers opting instead for alternative qualifications such as the International Baccalaureate or simply taking fewer A-levels.","Number of 17-year-olds taking geography has shot up 17% while demand for history has leapt 14% .

"By . Associated Press . A rapidly spreading wildfire in Northern California forced the evacuation of about 700 homes Saturday as it raced through Sierra Nevada foothills turned tinder-dry by drought. Evacuation orders were expanded in and around the River Pines Estates community in Amador County. Previous orders had covered about 250 homes about 40 miles east of Sacramento. Since Friday, the so-called Sand Fire has destroyed five homes and seven outbuildings. Many vineyards are in the area but the flames were moving away from them, said Lynn Tolmachoff, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Wildfire: Marin County firefighter Brett Grayson watches out for hotspots in a vineyard, as the fast-moving wildfire called Sand Fire burns near Plymouth, California on July 26 . Dry conditions: Members of the CAL Fire Vina Helitack crew battle the fire, which started Friday . The fire broke out around 5 p.m. Friday and crossed the Cosumnes River into more rugged terrain, quickly spreading to dry, thick brush and woodland terrain near vineyards in the Shenandoah Valley. 'The drought is very severe here. All the plants are catching fire and spreading very easily,' Tolmachoff said. The wildfire burned within 200 yards of the Story Winery in Plymouth on Friday. It was closed Saturday but hoped to reopen Sunday. 'We're good,' owner Rob Campbell told the Sacramento Bee. 'The road's closed coming in, so we're just hanging out making sure there's no hot spots.' 'We've got CalFire guys using our tasting room as a lookout point,' he said. All but two or three of the 40 wineries represented by the Amador Vintners Association were open Saturday, and those were affected by road closures, said Shan Trail, an association official in Plymouth. Evacuations: About 700 homes have been evacuated in the area which has burned through five houses and 3,000 acres . Semi-contained: Firefighters hike in to battle the Sand Fire near Plymouth. Cooler conditions and dying winds are helping them bring the blaze under control . The two-square-mile blaze was only 20 per cent contained and was throwing off embers that created small spot fires in its path. Pushed by 20 mph wind gusts, it flashed through waist-high grass and torched oaks and pines, Tolmachoff said. Hundreds of firefighters worked in triple-digit heat, aided by aircraft, including a giant DC-10 tanker. Investigators are trying to determine whether a burned car found by the riverbed ignited the fire, which has sent up huge plumes of smoke and worsened air quality in the Sacramento area. Blazes also burned in other Western states. The nation's largest wildfire, the 618-square-mile Buzzard Complex in eastern Oregon, was 95 per cent contained Saturday as crews also battled other fires in the state. All hands on deck: A DC-10 Air Tanker makes a drop on the Sand Fire at the middle fork of the Cosumnes River in Northern California as firefighters standby to protect a home on Saturday . Raging nearby: Firefighters protect an evacuated home while the Sand Fire terrifyingly close . There was also progress on Washington's largest wildfire, the 390-square-mile Carlton Complex in north-central part of the state, which was almost 60 per cent contained. Cooler weather and rain helped firefighters get a handle on the lightning-caused fire, but heat and wind picked up Saturday. Officials increased their estimate of burned homes from 150 to 300 Friday. In Utah, evacuation orders for 200 homes in Summit County and 10 homes in Utah County were lifted. No homes burned and there were no injuries. One of the fires started early Saturday when two teenagers playing with fireworks ignited dry grass and brush, police said. Other wildfires burned in Utah, Colorado and other states in the West.","Around 700 homes and 1,200 people have been evacuated from homes in Northern California .

"By . Darren Boyle . More than 34 houses worth in excess of £1 million are sold every day according to new figures released today by the Land Registry. The House Price Index showed that in April 2014, 1,028 houses sold for seven figures, with 214 reaching in excess of £2 million. Chelsea has become the most desirable spot to live in London among the super rich as Russian oligarchs drive a billionaire property boom in west London. In April 2014, 735 homes sold in the capital for more than £1 million. Of the mansions reaching seven figures, almost 200 of them cost more than £2 million. The Boltons in Chelsea is currently on sale for £39.5 million which would cost a further £2.75 million in stamp duty for any prospective owner . The luxury house is one of the many which is fueling a seven-figure property boom across the country with 34 houses worth more than £1 million selling daily . Over the past 12 months, there were 478 properties sold in Chelsea costing more than seven figures with 57 in excess of £5 million according  to new figures . According to new figures, Chelsea is now far more desirable among oligarchs and billionaires than the traditional wealthy spots of Kensington, Mayfair and Knightsbridge. Over a 12 month period there were 478 sales in Chelsea - with 57 of those homes costing in excess of £5 million. Kensington was the second most popular destination for wealthy home buyers, with 340 sales in the area - 44 of which cost more than £5 million. In third place was St John’s Wood, where there were 259 sales with 20 costing more than £5 million. Making up the top six were Knightsbridge, with 145 sales (45 were £5m+), Belgravia with 140 (29 at £5m+) and Mayfair, where there were 105 sales (19 at £5m+). The most expensive home sold in Chelsea was 11 Upper Phillimore Gardens, a seven bed mansion which fetched £28.5 million. In England and Wales, 1028 properties sold for seven figures in April 2014 alone, compared with 740 in April 2013 - an increase of 39 per cent . Next was a seven bedroom home on Cottesmore Gardens, which sold for £19.75 million, followed by 50 Chelsea Square, a six bed pad that cost its new owner £13.5 million. Between them, the buyers of these three houses ended up paying more than £4.3 million in stamp duty. Chelsea, which is made up of six ‘hamlets’ spread across almost 3,000 acres, is home to the likes of oligarch Roman Abramovich, socialite Amanda Eliyash and rock star Mick Jagger. The borough has the largest population of American citizens outside of the USA, making up 6.53 per cent of the current population of Chelsea. This is according to research by London estate agency Russell Simpson, which analysed statistics from LonRes. Alan Russell, from the agency, said: 'Chelsea is an area that is talked about globally. 'It is iconic, people from Britain and abroad aspire to live here, it has always been one of the most sought after areas in London. 'This has been highlighted in recent months, as Chelsea has outsold its prime Central London neighbours.' According to the new figures, the average price of a new home is worth 172,011, an increase of 6.4 per cent on 2013 with huge variations across the country. In London an average house is now £437,000 compared with £98,500 in the North East. Houses in Blackburn are reduced in value by more than eight per cent over the past 12 months compared with Lambeth where they have jumped by more than a quarter. House prices in England and Wales have shown stronger increases in London and areas of the South East, while parts of Wales and the North West have been stagnant . In the capital, house prices are increasing at 15 per cent, faster than they did at the height of the last boom in late 2009, while nationwide growth is nearer five per cent .","A staggering 34 homes worth more than £1 million are being sold EVERY DAY according to new figures just released .

"By . David Kent . A video has emerged appearing to show Argentinean supporters attacking and robbing a Brazilian fan prior to their World Cup match with Nigeria in Porto Alegre on Wednesday night. The clip, recorded by Brazilian television company RBS, shows half a dozen fans in Argentine club shirts knocking a man wearing a black jacket with 'Brazil' on the reverse to the ground. He is then kicked by several of them while others reach inside his jacket to try and steal possessions. One walks away casually with his rucksack after dragging it off his back.

State fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff says the drone was sighted above the fire burning in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of Sacramento on Sunday, the day after the fire broke out. The person controlling the unmanned aircraft, whom she did not identify, was trying to get video of the blaze and was told to stop by authorities because of the potential danger to firefighting planes.

About 1,900 firefighters, aided by aircraft including a DC-10 air tanker, were working to control the blaze. CalFire officials say the fire started Friday when a vehicle drove over dry vegetation. Alfred Shults, his wife, Carolyn, and their granddaughter fled their home in El Dorado County on Friday after receiving an automated telephone call ordering residents to evacuate, according to the Sacramento Bee. Before he left, Shults said he packed as much as he could into his vehicle and turned on a sprinkler to soak the area around his beloved motorcycle. 'We just wanted to get out of there, and hope there's something left when we get back,' Alfred Shults, 65, told the Bee on Saturday as they waited for news at an evacuation center in Placerville.

"By . Fiona Macrae . The morning-after pill may not prevent pregnancies in overweight women, it emerged last night. Fears were raised over Levonelle, Britain’s most popular emergency contraceptive, after the maker of a similar pill said theirs did not work among women over a certain weight. Studies show that Norlevo, which contains the same key ingredient as Levonelle, is less effective among women who weigh more than 11 stone 11lb and does not work at all in women over 12 stone 8lb. The average British woman weighs around 11 stone. Fears were raised over the top-selling UK pill Levonelle - which contains the same key ingredient as Norlevo . Norlevo is not sold in the UK but at . least 200,000 prescriptions a year are written out for Levonelle and . similar drugs. Many more packets are sold over the counter. The . drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory . Agency, stressed that women should continue to follow their doctors’ advice. However, it is to review if Levonelle and other morning-after . pills containing levonorgestrel – a synthetic version of the female sex . hormone progesterone – need to carry a warning about weight. The Food and Drug Administration, the US watchdog, is carrying out a review and, on the Continent, Norlevo will carry warnings. The . issue came to light two years ago, when an Edinburgh University study . found that obese women were more than three times as likely as those of . normal weight to become pregnant after taking the morning-after pill. The link was particularly strong for levonorgestrel-based pills. It . is thought that the drug may be diluted in bigger women or broken down . more quickly by their bodies. It is also possible that the drug is . soaked up by their fat cells, stopping it from working properly. Weight limit: Norlevo only works well for women who weigh less than 165 pounds, the manufacturer says . Professor . Anna Glasier, the study’s lead researcher, advised bigger women to have . a copper coil, or IUD, fitted or take EllaOne, another morning-after . pill containing a different chemical. It works for longer than Levonelle . and is more effective and can be taken up to five days after . unprotected sex. Professor Glasier said: ‘If you can only get levonorgestrel, then if it were me, I’d take it and hope I was lucky.’ Dr . Diana Mansour, of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, . said that among overweight and obese women, the drug is probably . absorbed by their fat more quickly, giving it less time to work. Dr . Mansour said: ‘It has less of a chance to delay ovulation and there are . lower levels of the drug to have an effect.’ She said it wasn’t clear if . giving bigger women a higher dose would solve the problem. Don't use our product: The maker of Norlevo has told women weighing more than 176 pounds the pill will not work for them . The . Family Planning Association urged concerned women to seek medical . advice. Lynn Hearton, the FPA’s clinical spokesman, said: ‘It is . particularly important that we don’t put some women off taking emergency . contraception because they think it won’t work. It is always better to . use some form of emergency contraception than none at all.’ A . Levonelle dose consists of one tablet that should be taken within 72 . hours of unprotected sex, although it is more effective the sooner it is . taken. It is thought to . prevent pregnancy by interfering with the release of eggs and disrupting . fertilisation. It may also stop any fertilised egg from implanting in . the womb. Levonelle’s manufacturer, Medimpex, did not respond to requests for a comment.","Fears raised over Levonelle, Britain's most popular brand after maker of a similar pill said it did not work among women over a certain weight .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . Jos Buttler was 14 when he discovered he had not quite got to the pitch of the ball in a first XI game for King’s College Taunton against West Country rivals Blundell’s School. But he didn’t panic. Extending his hands through the shot, he deposited the Blundell’s off-spinner over extra cover for six. Then he did it again. His coach was Dennis Breakwell, the former Northamptonshire and Somerset slow left-armer. ‘He just went “bump”. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Buttler deserves his chance . What a blast: Big-hitting Jos Buttler blazes away for England . 'He hit the ball that hard. It was timing. It’s a gift. You can’t coach that sort of thing.’ By the time Buttler was 16, and averaging almost 95 as King’s captain, Breakwell reckoned he was a ‘better cricketer ability-wise than Ian Botham at that age’. Until then Breakwell, who is still head groundsman at the school, believed the best 16-year-old he had seen was his old Northamptonshire team-mate Peter Willey. ‘Then I saw Jos Buttler.’ With English cricket aching for a good-news story, there is of course the risk of saddling a Test debutant with an impossible burden. And so far Buttler’s most eye-catching deeds — not least  an incendiary 74-ball 121 in a  one-dayer against Sri Lanka at Lord’s two months ago — have come in the limited-overs arena. Natural talent: A teenage Jos Buttler at King's College in 2006 . VIDEO Buttler deserves his chance . But it would take a peculiarly English kind of conservatism to play down the potential of the nation’s new wicketkeeper-batsman. Unsurprisingly, that conservatism has already had an airing. After the fireworks at Lord’s, Alastair Cook suggested Buttler, 23, was not ready for Test cricket. It felt like an unnecessary slap on the wrist. Yet the demise of Matt Prior means he can set about laying the angst to rest, starting with Sunday’s third Test against India in Southampton. There will be failures along the way. But for those who knew him growing up, there is little doubt he will make the job his. ‘I’ve got a bet on that he’ll be England captain in five years,’ said Breakwell. ‘Odds of 14-1.’ How much did he wager? A slight pause. ‘I had a nice bet.’ Promise: Buttler was better cricketer ability-wise than England legend Ian Botham at 16 . Andy Hurry, the Somerset head coach who was in charge when Buttler first played top-level cricket at the age of 18 in 2009, remembers the smallest of cameos that year at the Twenty20 Champions League in India. ‘Our last game was against New South Wales and he had to face Brett Lee. He dealt with it superbly.’ Buttler faced just three balls from the Aussie paceman, scoring three runs. But Hurry had seen enough. ‘You find out quickly if someone can make the step up mentally.’ Buttler’s USP might be his one-day international strike-rate, which is a frightening 128, and the full spectrum of strokes. But what of his other talents? Hurry said: ‘First, he’s a student of the game. He wants to be the best he can. He speaks to the senior players a lot to find out ways of improving. He has incredible hand-eye coordination and belief. I’ve got no issues at all about whether he’ll make the step up.’ There is passion, too. Breakwell recalls Buttler’s reaction to his dismissal after making a century against Millfield School aged 14. ‘He got out just before we won, and he cried. He still gets emotional. He’s a genuinely nice guy.’ Concerns Buttler’s batting was more attuned to white-ball than red-ball cricket have been assuaged this summer following his move from Somerset to Lancashire. Playing for a team that is facing relegation, he has averaged 40, with one hundred and five 50s. ‘He’s a long way down the road with his batting compared to where he was,’ said Hurry. ‘He’s batting higher up the order and is moving forward.’ Hurry and Breakwell still follow Buttler’s progress, with a mixture of pride and anxiety. ‘I won’t be going to Southampton,’ said Breakwell. ‘The school are trying to get me to go, but I’ll be too  nervous.’ He might be talking for everyone in English cricket.","Buttler first caught the eye by smashing successive sixes for school team .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Bernie Ecclestone’s 40-year hold on Formula One could be over within days after a judge said the billionaire had committed bribery and lied about it in the High Court. The devastating findings came despite Ecclestone winning an £85million damages claim brought by German media firm Constantin Medien on a technicality. Mr Justice Newey’s judgment leaves Ecclestone waiting on Donald Mackenzie, the chairman of CVC, the private equity firm which has a controlling interest in Formula One, to pronounce on his fate. In doubt: Bernie Ecclestone's 40-year hold on Formula One could be over within days . All smiles: World Champion Sebastian Vettel pictured with Ecclestone after the German clinched his third title . Mackenzie, who rarely speaks in public, was again keeping his counsel on Thursday night. But figures close to him told Sportsmail that during frantic conference and telephone calls yesterday several board members urged him to end Ecclestone’s reign. ‘This should have been dealt with at least nine months ago,’ said one well-placed source on condition of anonymity. ‘It has run on too long and it needs Donald to deal with it immediately. Bernie’s position is untenable.’ Mackenzie has been reluctant to sack Ecclestone, 83, because he has run the business so successfully - its annual revenue is £1billion - and there is nobody else who could take over immediately. All the papers are in his office in Kensington, London. Court case: Ecclestone, seen here at a charity event in Austria earlier this year, faces 10 years in jail . Handing down judgment in Court 17 of the Rolls Building, Mr Justice Newey said: ‘Even making allowances for the lapse of time and Mr Ecclestone’s age, I am afraid that I find it impossible to regard him as a reliable or truthful witness. ‘The payments were a bribe. They were made because Mr Ecclestone had entered into a corrupt agreement with Dr Gribkowsky in May 2005 under which Dr Gribkowsky was to be rewarded for facilitating the sale of (German bank) BayernLB’s shares in the Formula One group to a buyer acceptable to Mr Ecclestone (namely CVC).’ Ecclestone could face up to 10 years in jail if he is found guilty of bribery in a criminal court in Germany, where Gribkowsky has already been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in jail for accepting the money. That trial is due to start in April. End of an era? Ecclestone was described as not 'reliable or truthful' by Mr Justice Newey . Ecclestone told Sportsmail on Thursday night: ‘I have no idea whether I’ll be sacked. If the board believe I allegedly lied and tell me to go, then that is what I would do. I would rather go on my terms. ‘I didn’t lie to the court. I told the truth. The judge just didn’t see it that way. ‘But even if I did lie and was unreliable, I have being doing a reasonably good job for 35 years. So why shouldn’t I carry on? It’s business as usual.’ Worrying times: Ecclestone told Sportsmail it is unclear whether he will be sacked .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Less than a month after Pope Francis excommunicated members of the mob, a church procession has apparently defied him by changing route to honour a convicted gangster. The procession through Oppido Mamertina, a Calabrian town and stronghold of the 'ndrangheta crime syndicate, detoured to pass the home of an 82-year-old convicted murderer. The mayor, local clergy, parents pushing baby strollers and dozens of local men carrying an ornate Madonna statue marched past the home of the killer who, because of his age, was allowed to serve out his life sentence under house arrest. A statue of the Madonna is carried during religious procession in Oppido Mamertina, Calabria, which made a detour to pass the home of an 82-year-old 'ndragheta boss and convicted murderer under house arrest . The mayor, local clergy, parents pushing baby strollers and dozens of local men carrying an ornate Madonna statue marched past the home of the killer, but three policemen left the procession in disgust and complained . Interior Minister Angelino Alfano on Sunday denounced the tribute as 'deplorable and disgusting' and praised three Carabinieri policemen who abandoned the procession in disapproval. Carabinieri officer Andrea Marino said he and his fellow officer walked away from the July 2 procession after the detour and headed to the church to complain about what happened. One of Calabria's anti-Mafia prosecutors, Nicola Gratteri, told The Associated Press that the detour to the mobster's house appeared to be a 'challenge to the diktat' of Francis. The 'ndrangheta, a global cocaine trafficker, is one of the world's most powerful crime syndicates. Religious rituals hold an important place in the mobsters' mentality. On June 21, Francis, visiting . Calabria, had denounced the 'ndrangheta for its 'adoration of evil' and . said its members were excommunicated. The town's bishop said he would take 'measures' against those who exploited the procession to defy Pope Francis, pictured right in Calabria on the day he denounced and excommunicated members of the 'ndragheta . Oppido Mamertino's bishop, Monsignor Francesco Milito, said he would take undescribed 'measures' against those exploiting the church procession to pay homage to the local boss. Elsewhere in southern Italy, other 'ndrangheta members appeared to have paid attention to the pope's words but perhaps not in the way he intended. Another bishop, Monsignor Giancarlo Bregantini, told Vatican Radio Sunday that some 200 inmates in the maximum-security section of Larino prison told their chaplain they would boycott Mass. They reasoned that if they had been excommunicated it made no sense for them to attend anymore.","Procession in 'ndrangheta stronghold detoured to pass mobster's home .

"By . Darren Boyle . Lee Jones, pictured, disappeared from work after he was accused of trying to defraud a former friend . A luxury spa has called in fraud investigators after the general manager who appeared on a fly-on-the-wall documentary allegedly disappeared with £10,000 in petty cash. Lee Jones, general manager of Champneys in Tring, Hertfordshire which charges up to £1,200 a night, vanished days after the ITV show was broadcast when a former disgruntled friend recognised him and phoned the spa. The friend, Cheryl Howard said that Jones had tried to use her Harrods store card to buy more than £2,000 in luxury goods. Jones, 40, told the luxury resort's owners that his mother had shares in Louis Vuitton while his father was an eminent QC. However, it has emerged that this is not the case and his parents live in a former council house in the West Midlands. The spa's co-owner Stephen Purdew told Mail Online: 'The police are investigating this. We went to the local station and then to Action Fraud who said they would be back to us later this week. 'Lee Jones was utterly charming and if he was honest, he'd be very successful in life. It is such a shame because he was doing such a great job here. The staff are devastated because they were working really hard fro him. 'I got his CV through an agency and it now seems that everything on it was false. He is a conman. I found him very charming and I liked him.' The spa is currently undergoing a massive renovation which is around 80 per cent complete. Mr Purdew added: 'He threw away such a good opportunity working here. It is a great job, but I have someone coming in next Monday who I know very well. 'He is going to end up ripping off some old lady if he is allowed to continue like this.' Jones began working in Champneys in September 2013 as assistant manager and was promoted to general manager in April. The 'incredibly charismatic' general manager, who drove a luxury £60,000 Range Rover told work colleagues that he had recently bought a £5 million property in Notting Hill in London, however the street he named does not exist. His former friend Cheryl Howard met Jones while he worked in a London hotel. He claimed he was temporarily homeless and she invited him to move into her house in Surrey. While staying at her house, Ms Howard claims Jones tried to buy more than £2,000 of clothes and garden equipment on her Harrods store card. She reported the attempt to Action Fraud. Jones was general manager with Champneys and was spotted by his former friend Cheryl Howard who spotted him during . Ms Howard rang Champneys after the documentary was screened on ITV to alert them to Jones' past. When confronted by Stephen Purdew, the spa's co-owner, Jones denied all knowledge of Ms Howard's claims suggesting they were a 'fantasy'. He left work telling Mr Purdew that he was going to consult with a lawyer. Subsequently it emerged that £10,000 was missing from petty cash. It is claimed that Jones withdrew £6,100 from petty cash last week following an earlier claim of £3,500. Mr Purdew confirmed that he did not authorise either transaction. Ms Howard said she became very good friends with Jones and even introduced him to all of her friends when she became aware there was a problem. 'I was in Harrods and one of the managers asked me how it was that I was simultaneously in the store and trying to buy something on my online account. Someone using the delivery address of my house in Weybridge was trying to order £2,080 worth of kitchen equipment, flowers, sports clothing and suits.' Both Hertfordshire Police and Action Fraud have been contacted for comment.","Lee Jones appeared on an ITV documentary about the luxury spa in Tring .

Wolff was cycling with members of the Mercedes team when the incident took place along the River Danube ahead of this weekend’s race in Hungary. Neither Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg, who won Sunday’s German Grand Prix to extend his lead in the drivers’ championship to 14 points, were involved. Jubilant: Nico Rosberg (middle) celebrates his German Grand Prix win with his Mercedes team . Success: Toto Wolff (right) congratulates Nico Rosberg after winning the German Grand Prix last weekend . Wolff had a metal plate inserted in his wrist, but is still expected to be on the Mercedes pit wall for the final race ahead of the four-week summer break this weekend. ‘We’ve decided to leave it to the pros now,’ said Wolff. ‘Lewis and Nico are better wheel to wheel at 300km/h that we are at 30km/h.’ Susie Wolff, the Williams reserve driver and wife of the Mercedes team boss, then posted a picture of him on Twitter where he is seen sporting a brace on his arm and a sling. ‘My husband the hero,’ she said. ‘As we know, boys, will be boys. Looks like I am on nurse duty for the next few weeks.’ Support: Wolff's wife and Williams development driver offered her support to her injured husband on Twitter . Earlier this week, Wolff became the first team boss to openly criticise the double points system which will be introduced for the first time at this year’s finale in Abu Dhabi. ‘I don’t think it’s fair.

"By . Phil Duncan . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . Lewis Hamilton could crack under the pressure of fighting to win his second Formula One championship, his former rival Felipe Massa has warned. Hamilton has been cast 29 points adrift of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg ahead of this weekend's British Grand Prix. The British star, who robbed Massa of the championship in the most dramatic of circumstances at the season finale in Brazil six years ago, has been hit with two mechanical retirements this year, while Rosberg has finished either first or second at every race. But Massa, speaking on the eve of his 200th Formula One start, believes Hamilton has been outsmarted by his team-mate so far this season. 'Lewis is one of the greatest drivers in terms of speed, and he has incredible talent,' Massa told Sportsmail. 'I would say Nico is losing a little bit, in terms of speed compared to Lewis, but maybe he is using a bit more of his brain. I can handle it! Felipe Massa warned that Lewis Hamilton could crack under the pressure of chasing the title . Trailing: The Brit is 29 points behind German team-mate Nico Rosberg heading to Silverstone . 'From now until the last race we might see that Lewis is back to his top form, winning races and starting from pole, but maybe not. Maybe he is under pressure because he is behind in the championship, so Nico can use that to his favour.' Hamilton came to within one race of making grand prix history and being crowned champion in his first year in the sport in 2007. But he blew a 12-point lead with just two races remaining, spinning into the gravel on his entrance to the pits and retiring from the penultimate race in China, before finishing only seventh at the final grand prix in Brazil. A year . later, Hamilton returned to Interlagos to win the title, but only after . he passed the Toyota of Timo Glock on the last corner of the last lap in . torrid conditions, to stop Massa, who won the race, from claiming the . title. 'When . you are at at team where the worst situation is you finish second, a . driver who has lost all the points because he did not finish has a big, . big impact and that is what has happened with Lewis,' added Massa in . reference to Hamilton's retirements in Australia and Canada. No 1: Rosberg won the Austrian Grand Prix to extend his lead over Hamilton before the British Grand Prix . Company: Hamilton and Arnaud Bamberger attend the Cartier Lunch at the Goodwood Festival of Speed . 'It makes his pressure higher, and his work higher, but he cannot be so nervous about it otherwise he could lose even more. Lewis was a driver that maybe lost under the pressure when he was fighting for the championship in 2007 and 2008, but maybe he has a little bit more experience now. I don't know if that will help or not, but for sure he has more pressure now than Nico.' Massa arrives at Silverstone in good form after he stunned the paddock by claiming the first non-Mercedes pole of the year in Austria last month. It was his first in almost six years, and comes after he moved to Williams over the winter, frustrated by playing second fiddle to Fernando Alonso at Ferrari. 'I am at a team which really respects me 100 per cent and want to do everything they can to make me competitive again - to fight for podiums but also for victories, too,' he explains. 'When people spend so long at a place, a change is like a re-start and you feel younger and you need that. I needed that and maybe even Ferrari, too. So, it was the right change which came at the right time.' Breaking the streak: Massa (centre) claimed the first non Mercedes pole of the season in Austria . Close: The Brazilian was disappointed to miss out on the podium and finish fourth in Spielberg . Massa admitted he was disappointed to finish only fourth after starting from pole, but the Brazilian was fortunate to even be on the grid at the Red Bull Ring following his spectacular 190mph crash with Sergio Perez in Canada a fortnight previously. 'I was sure it was going to hurt because it was so quick,' Massa said as he recalled the last-lap horror smash which saw both he and Perez admitted to hospital. 'It is the worst feeling you can have knowing that the wall is coming at you so quickly. I pulled 27G on the crash but thank God I am here and nothing happened to me.' Massa, 33, will be joined by an unfamiliar face on track this weekend, when Britain's Williams' development driver Susie Wolff becomes the first female in more than two decades to participate at a grand prix weekend. 'I think it is fantastic and great to see a lady driving the car , so I will try to help her in any way I can,' Massa said of Wolff, who will take to the wheel in Friday's practice session. 'I hope Susie does a good job with the opportunity she has, and it is not just because she is a lady. It depends how quick she can be, but what experience, performance and talent she can show to the team.' Tense: Brazil face Colombia in the World Cup quarter-final on Friday . Back in his native country, Brazil, who are battling to win the World Cup in front of an expectant home crowd, face Colombia in their quarter-final clash on Friday. 'I know how it is to win at home, and fight for the championship at home, so if we can win the World Cup it will be like a big dream coming true,' he says. 'But honestly, I am a sportsman and I know how difficult it is, and it doesn't always happen in the perfect way. The result might not be what you expect and this is part of sport, but Brazilians do not think like that. If you are second then you have lost. 'That is really tough but it is the mentality. I know if we do not win, the media will be very strong and the people, too. I don't enjoy it so much, but that is the way it is.' Randstad is an official partner to Williams Martini Racing.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 65-year-old former bartender from New South Wales has described the incredible moment he was shot in the stomach and left for dead by two armed robbers. Dick McGuigan endured 15 surgeries and was left with a disfigured stomach wound after the two hooded men stormed the Water Board Bowling Club in Newcastle where he was working at the time. Ryker Jenner and Joel Barton entered the club on a Sunday evening as a local meat raffle was finishing up, armed with a Ruger .223 mini-assault rifle and a screwdriver. Scroll down for video . Dick McGuigan has shared his survival story about the day he was shot in the stomach after trying to protect patrons from an armed robber at a Newcastle bar he worked at . In an effort to defend his clientele, which included families with their young children, Mr McGuigan told Nine News that he tried talking to the robbers in an attempt to stall them before police arrived. However Jenner and Barton only briefly verbally abused the man before attempting to flee the venue with a bag full of money. Mr McGuigan said he and a few others then begun to follow the two men, hoping to record their number plate for police, when they noticed him. 'The gunman came back in. We stopped in our tracks and he was aiming the gun directly at me,' he said. The 65-year-old said that he was shot after the two men caught him and a few others trying to get a glimpse of their number plate, with one of the men saying: 'Put one in the old guy' After a clear direction from Jennar to 'Put one in the old guy', Barton shot the rifle directly into Mr McGuigan's stomach. 'I saw the flash, heard the bang and felt something hit me in the stomach. I put my hand down and there was blood on my fingers.' Amazingly, after numerous surgeries and time in the intensive care unit, Mr McGuigan managed to survive to tell the tale. The hollow bullet only just managed to miss his spine as he turned to the side moments before being shot. Now, Mr McGuigan gives talks at other pubs and clubs across NSW about how to handle similar dangerous situations. CCTV from the event shows children were in the bar when the retiree was shot: Ryker Jenner and Joel Barton were found guilty of the shooting and robbery earlier this year . The retiree is also adamant for the scar on his stomach to be the only one he's left with, saying: 'They've ruined their lives. They're not going to ruin mine'. Jenner and Barton were hunted down by police and found guilty of the shooting as well as robbery earlier this year. Jennar has been sentenced to a minimum of 12 years in jail while Barton’s sentence will be handed out later in the year.","Dick McGuigan, 65, has undergone 15 surgeries since the day he was shot .

Mike Tindall agonised over his decision to retire, even after 17 years of top-flight rugby, according to Iain Balshaw. Tindall became the last of England's 2003 World Cup winners to hang up his boots on Tuesday, choosing not to chase a new start after being left surplus to requirements at Gloucester. The 35-year-old admitted he felt he could have played for two more years, but did not seek a new club after being released by Gloucester. Calling it a day: Mike Tindall has retired, bringing to an end a 17-year rugby career . Former Gloucester, Bath and England team-mate Balshaw said Tindall will not regret retiring, but still had to wrestle with the decision. 'It's a huge call for him to make, more so when you're not forced to retire through injury,' said Balshaw. 'He had a fantastic season last year, I know that he really wanted to carry on this year and stay at Gloucester, that wasn't to be. 'He will miss it, but he's made the decision to quit and he's got to look forward to what lies ahead. 'Only he knows, after 17 years, if would have really wanted to carry on he would have done so. 'It would have been a tough decision but he's got to look to the future.' Up for the cup: Tindall lifts the Webb Ellis trophy at Trafalgar Square after England won the 2003 World Cup . VIDEO Tindall last 2003 World Cup winner to retire . Fellow World Cup winner Balshaw beat Tindall to retirement by four days, confirming a knee injury has ended his hopes of playing on at Biarritz. Tindall, Balshaw and Jonny Wilkinson were the last of England's World Cup winners still plying their trade last season. Wilkinson ended his career with a Heineken Cup-Top 14 double at Toulon, while Balshaw's Biarritz were relegated from the French top flight. Tindall's retirement completes the end of an era for English rugby, with Balshaw hailing the 75-cap centre's influence at international level. End of an era: Balshaw (right) - best man at Tindall's wedding - poses alongside Tindall at Gloucester in 2006 . The Otley-born defensive fulcrum proved a pivotal figure in England's 2003 Six Nations Grand Slam that precipitated the World Cup victory. Tindall missed England's run to the 2007 World Cup final with a broken leg, but was back in the squad for the abortive 2011 campaign in New Zealand. Balshaw said Tindall offered the kind of grit any top-level player would want alongside them. 'He's had a huge impact on the English game,' said the 35-year-old former Leeds flyer. Monster hit: Tindall tackles Australia's George Gregan during the 2003 World Cup final . 'Everyone talks about him bulldozing players, but he was fantastic in defence and had a great kicking game.

"St Helens remain top of the First Utility Super League table but their 44-22 victory over Widnes was achieved at some cost with scrum-half Luke Walsh carried off on a stretcher with a nasty lower leg injury. Initially it looked like it was going to be a straight forward win with Saints leading 32-0 early on in the second half thanks to tries from Mark Flanagan, Tommy Makinson (twice), Mose Masoe (twice) and Jordan Turner. But Widnes hit back with three touchdowns in five minutes to make it a contest, before Makinson completed his hat-trick and Willie Manu got in on the scoring, with Rhys Hanbury getting a late consolation try for the visitors. Concern: Luke Walsh is carried off on a stretcher after suffering a leg injury . Saints opened the score after seven minutes when Walsh sent Flanagan in, with Mark Percival adding the extras. The hosts were soon back on the scoresheet when Makinson gathered Flanagan's kick wide to touch down. Further pressure told on 28 minutes when Masoe proved unstoppable from close range. He had further to run for the next one, leaving Vikings fullback Hanbury with no chance as he steamrollered his way to a second try. Percival goaled again to make it 22-0. Vikings lost back row MacGraff Leuluai to the sin-bin after numerous indiscretions just before the interval. After the break Masoe's offload allowed Turner to put Makinson in to cross under the posts. Makinson then returned the compliment to his centre with another neatly taken try three minutes later to leave the Vikings reeling. But the visitors managed to enjoy a blistering five-minute spell after getting themselves on the scoresheet for the first time on 50 minutes when they moved the ball well to create space for Cameron Phelps to power over on the left. Spectacular: St Helens' Tommy Makinson completes his hat trick against Widnes . Virtually from the restart the Vikings were in again with a long range movement that was polished off by Phelps as he completed a quick-fire double. A long delay followed after scrum half Walsh was carried off on a stretcher with his legs strapped together. But after that enforced break, it was again Widnes going the length of the field with Stefan Marsh racing 80 metres, rounding Paul Wellens to go under the sticks. Danny Tickle slotted the goal and the score was pegged back to 32-16. After that Saints managed to stem the flow and showed plenty of urgency when they countered, with James Roby helping the forwards to march the ball downfield. And from a repeat set, after Hep Cahill's fingers had nudged Gary Wheeler's high kick, Saints moved the ball well with Makinson going in at the corner for his third. Four minutes later the Widnes backline was breached again, with Manu pouncing on an attempted clearance to go over the line. Hanbury had the last word when his momentum took him over in the dying stages, with Tickle tagging on the goal, but the result was a formality for some time before that.","Scrum-half Luke Walsh carried off with nasty leg injury .

"By . Mary Greene . It used to be the soundtrack to our Saturday mornings - the 'whirr, clink-clink-clink' of the manual lawnmower as it was pushed and pulled over the grass. But in 1965 the Flymo, using technology from the hovercraft, came onto the market - and the British suburban garden would never sound the same again. As a new exhibition at London's Garden Museum explores 50 years of gardening, we can identify the key moments of change, says curator Russell Clark. Blast from the past: Picture shows a 1960s lawnmower advert . The first garden centre opened in Ferndown, Dorset, in 1955 after its owner visited the US searching for ideas to rescue his struggling nursery business and returned saying he'd 'seen the future'. He went on to open the first garden centre café in 1961. Container-grown plants were the key to making gardening an all-year-round activity. Until the early 1960s shrubs and trees were grown in nurseries and transplanted when dormant between November and March. The first container plants were grown in recycled tomato tins, before the advent of plastic pots in the 1970s before the ubiquitous winter-flowering pansy arrived in 1979. The mail-order seed industry, with its garish catalogues full of promise, went into decline - only to enjoy a revival thanks to the current trend for wildflower meadows. Even houseplants have changed. 'We needed a 1970s rubber plant for the exhibition... and it was hard to find one,' says Russell Clark. But moth orchids, once rare and exotic, are sold in every supermarket. A plant catalogue from the 1960s . The 1960s garden shed was filled with powders and potions marked 'Poison'. Although the pesticide DDT was banned in many countries in the 1970s, Gardeners' World presenter Arthur Billitt was a retired Boots' chemist who continued to promote chemical gardening. His predecessor (and former Daily Mail gardening writer) Percy Thrower was sacked by the BBC for a lucrative advertising deal for fertiliser. You had to sign the poisons register at a licensed dealer's to buy tins of nicotine shreds for fumigating a greenhouse infested with insects. And try not to breathe in - nicotine is a nerve gas. Sodium chlorate, an effective weedkiller, was banned in the EU because of its toxicity. But the 1970s, and the TV sitcom The Good Life, saw a surge of interest in organic gardening, championed in the 1980s by Prince Charles in his garden at Highgrove. The turning point for garden design, though, was John Brookes' 1969 book Room Outside, which advocated decking. 'Before that, gardens had lots of flowers, a lawn and a vegetable patch that was a hangover from the war,' explains Russell Clark. 'But then people started travelling abroad and eating outdoors, and the garden became an extension of the house and a sphere for personal expression.' It was the start of patios, water features and garden DIY projects. And then came Ground Force, first broadcast in September 1997 and attracting 12 million viewers at its peak, which caused B&Q's sales of garden decking to rocket from £5,000 in 1997 to £16 million by 2001. A 1960s gardener would be shocked that lawns have made way for driveways today, says Russell, and intrigued by the trend for ready-to-go topiary. 'It's about gardening becoming easier. You can leave the garden centre with an instant garden, which seems to fulfil a sort of craving in modern life.' 50 Years Of Gardening is at London's Garden Museum until 31 August. www.gardenmuseum.org.uk.

"By . Andy Sims, Press Association . Shooter Michael Gault's bid to become the outright most successful Commonwealth athlete of all time is over after he missed out on a place in the final of the 50m air pistol. The 60-year-old grandfather from Norfolk, competing at his sixth Games, had drawn level with fellow shooter Phillip Adams on Saturday when he won his 18th medal, taking bronze in the 10m discipline. Blow: Michael Gault has missed out on the chance to become the most successful Commonwealth athlete of all time . Gault said afterwards that he had achieved what he came out of retirement for, and that he would be 'chillaxing' when he stepped back on to the range for Monday's event. And, despite shooting a competitive total of 529 from his six rounds, he bowed out of the competition in 13th place. Afterwards Gault confirmed he would be hanging up his gun competitively, ruling out another tilt at a 19th medal in Australia in four years. 'I wanted to give it a little bash and try to get the all-time record,' he said. 'But unfortunately the bullets I used wouldn't go into the middle of the target. They kept flying into the nine ring, or sometimes the eight! 'It was a case of not enough 10s today. It's a shame. I was trying - I wasn't too chillaxed. I gave it my best shot but my body was telling me it's time to pack up. My legs are burning and I've got a trapped nerve in my back, so it's time to call it a day.' Gault does want to stay involved in shooting, however, and hopes to take up a coaching role.He also revealed he would dedicate Saturday's record-equalling bronze to Parkinson's UK, with his wife Janet suffering from the disease. 'I've sacrificed the family a bit, going away from home twice a week to train, leaving my wife on her own,' he added. 'The last year has been pretty bad.

The berries are packed with amino acids, as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc. The fruit perishes quickly after being picked, so to help preserve its goodness it is often made into acai berry juice, supplements or powder, which is often whizzed into a smoothie. Speaking about the potent powder, food blogger and nutritionist Deliciously Ella said: 'Acai is unbelievably rich in antioxidants, with one of the highest levels ever tested (eight times that of blueberries and 10 to 30 times that of red wine,) as well as vitamin E and omega-3s, all of which work to stop free radical damage and keep your body. 'It’s also amazing for keeping your skin glowing and slowing down the signs of ageing.' According to some sites selling acai products, the berry's fibre and essential fatty acid content contribute to its ability to burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly, cut down on cravings, and boost metabolism. Video courtesy of Howcast.com . What are they? Acai berries, which Victoria tweeted about, originated in the Amazonian rainforest and are packed with amino acids, as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc . Victoria isn't the only fan of acai; health aficionado Miranda Kerr once said in an interview: 'I sprinkle it on my porridge, gluten-free cereal or smoothie.' A prolific tweeter, Victoria also tweeted her love of another one of her favourite healthy food supplements: bee panacea. Bee panacea combines all the components of bee products, including raw honey, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly. It is also packed with algae, herbs, botanicals and probiotics, making it one of the most nutritious and effective superfoods available. Victoria has long been a fan of bee pollen, which is widely considered one of nature's most complete nourishing . superfoods because it contains nearly all of the nutrients required to . function by humans, including amino acids, B-complex, and folic acid. It is said that bee . pollen boosts energy levels, can be used topically to soothe skin . conditions, curbs cravings and even acts as an aphrodisiac. Superfood fan: Since turning 40, Victoria has been tweeting about her love of superfoods including acai, left, and bee panacea, right, which is known as one of the most nutritious superfoods ever . It comes as no surprise that Victoria has been focussing on boosting her health regime - the busy fashion designer has just unveiled a sneak peek of her AW14 Victoria, Victoria Beckham collection - and it's full of embellished minis, crisp polka-dot shirts and soft cashmere jumpers. The 40-year-old fashionista has teamed up with American photographer Todd Hido, who has created a sultry and somewhat kooky campaign for her new range. Victoria, Victoria Beckham describes itself as 'the playful younger sister to the style icon's eponymous main line. A collection of light, bright and breezy pieces, make space in your wardrobe for relaxed shift dresses adorned with charming details.' The mother of four unveiled her range at an event thrown by e-tailer Net-a-porter in Manhattan on Monday. Fashion empire: Victoria Beckham has unveiled a sneak peak of her Victoria AW14 range .

"By . Ian Ladyman In Los Angeles . Former England captain Bryan Robson believes there is no outstanding candidate to replace Steve Gerrard as national skipper and that Roy Hodgson’s team are still miles away from  winning a major tournament. Gerrard retired from international football this week after a disappointing World Cup, leaving Hodgson to choose a replacement. Robson, who played 90 times for his country, spoke this week on Manchester United’s pre-season tour of America and admitted he is depressed by England’s immediate prospects.

VIDEO Rooney favourite for captain role . He said: 'There is no stand-out captain. Even a few years ago, you had the likes of John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Gerrard and Frank Lampard who could have been captain. 'There was a decision to be made over which one you would go with as captain because they were all strong candidates. But at this moment in time, I don’t think there is an outstanding candidate. 'Yes it does worry me a bit for England’s future. We haven’t got an outstanding candidate for captain and that is a worrying sign.' Robson believes United striker Wayne Rooney is among the leading candidates for the job. He added: 'You look at it and it is a . difficult one. You want somebody who is a talker on the pitch, somebody . who can organise and I think it is difficult for a forward to do that. 'But if you look at the England set-up at . the moment, the candidates are probably Joe Hart, Gary Cahill, because . he will be in the team, and Wayne Rooney. Time to kick on: Wayne Rooney is on tour with Manchester United and could be a future England captain . Leading the way: Wayne Rooney may soon be captain of Manchester United and England . Stepping up? Wayne Rooney is a leading candidate to take over from Steven Gerrard . 'And the only one who really stands out is Wayne. There is no other real candidate when you look at it. If Wayne is not first choice in the England team, it will mean some of the young lads will have come through and done really well because, now that Gerrard has stepped down, Wayne is by far England’s best player. 'It doesn’t matter if you captain your club, it is about who is right for the job and who has the experience to be captain. 'If Wayne was to be selected as captain, it might give him a real boost where he really feels he needs to lead by example.s That may get the best out of Wayne, but that is the manager’s choice at the end of the day.' Robson - speaking at an event in Los Angeles hosted by Bulova Manchester United's official timekeeper - watched England’s dismal World Cup summer with dismay.

'Now that they are coming into the squad, they are getting the chance, but we just have to wait for a year or two years. 'There are others, such as Chamberlain and Wilshere, who you have to give time to progress to become top-drawer players. Otherwise, if they prove that they are just good players, it will be a disappointment. Because of the qualifying group we have for Euro 2016, I think we can go on and progress to the finals again, but as far as going on to win something like that, I still think we are way off.'","Gerrard retired from international football after a disappointing World Cup .

"By . Mike Perez . Real Madrid have officially unveiled new £60million signing James Rodriguez after they completed the transfer of the World Cup Golden Boot winner from Monaco on Tuesday.

In fact, that's how Rodriguez's first name should be pronounced, which ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley learned the hard way. Tyldesley explained his pronunciation of the Colombia talisman's first name, which he dons on the back of his shirt, after being criticised for opting to call him by the English version. ‘I am in the identification business, I am not a linguist,' he said.'Believe it or believe it not, I do try to get pronunciations correct. And, yes, in his native Spanish language James Rodriguez becomes ‘Hamez Rod-reeg-ez’. 'The complications and dilemmas come when – like me – you are not a native Spanish speaker, or any other ‘speaker’ but plain English.' 'Colombia will be at your side,' said Perez, which raised a cheer from the fans in the stadium. Rodriguez said: 'I hope to win many titles here, Hala Madrid,' invoking the club's chant. An overly-zealous Colombian fan ran on to the pitch to hug Rodriguez and he was restrained by security personnel. Neither club have confirmed the fee for the 23-year-old, but reports suggest Madrid have paid about £60million, which would make Rodriguez the fourth most expensive transfer of all time after Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez. A . Real Madrid statement read: 'Real Madrid have reached an agreement with . Monaco for the transfer of James Rodriguez, who will join the club for . the next six seasons. 'The player will be presented today, Tuesday 22 July, at 20:00 (Spanish time), in the Santiago Bernabeu's presidential box. 'Following . that, James Rodriguez will take his first steps on the Santiago . Bernabeu's pitch wearing the Real Madrid shirt and will attend the media . in the press room.' Rodriguez . was one of the revelations of the World Cup, scoring in each of . Colombia's games as they reached the quarter-finals of the competition . for the very first time, eventually losing 2-1 to hosts Brazil. In . total Rodriguez scored six goals at the World Cup to finish as the . leading scorer - one clear of Thomas Muller - while his stunning 25-yard . volley against Uruguay was voted goal of the tournament on FIFA.com. His . signing comes less than a week after Madrid brought in another of the . World Cup's star performers in Germany's Toni Kroos, who moved from . Bayern Munich for a reported £24m. It . also means that, if the reported figure is correct, Madrid now boast . three of the four most expensive signings in history, having spent a . world-record £80m on Bale last summer and the same on Ronaldo in . 2009. The Champions League . winners would hold a clean sweep of the top three signings but for . arch-rivals Barcelona, who splashed out a reported £75m on .

His . performances for the Buenos Aires outfit attracted the attention of . Porto, who signed him for £4m in 2010, and three years later he . joined Monaco for £38.5m after helping the Portuguese side win a . hat-trick of league titles and the 2011 Europa League. The . left-footed forward scored 10 goals in 38 matches in all competitions . for Monaco last term as they finished second in Ligue 1 behind Paris St . Germain. Big-spending . Monaco said they had not been looking to sell Rodriguez but described . the deal as 'one of the most significant transfers in football history'. Monaco vice-president and CEO Vadim Vasilyev said: 'AS Monaco is proud to have helped James Rodriguez reveal his talent to the world as he notably made his mark on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil winning the Golden Boot. James is a fantastic player who achieved great things with AS Monaco.'

'Monaco is proud to be a party to one of the most significant transfers in football history. 'Monaco . is a club that will continue to grow and remains focused on the future. More than ever it has the ambition to strengthen the team and continue . to progress for next season.' Rodriguez is determined to make history at Real Madrid rather than crumble under the pressure of becoming the fourth most expensive player of all time. Rodriguez : 'The numbers mean nothing to me. I just want to help make history and bring joy to the Madrid fans. 'This is a club which is used to winning and I'm prepared mentally and physically to do so. It is a pleasure to be among so many stars and I'm sure I'll learn a lot from everyone.' 'I've suffered a lot to get here and when you do that then it tastes so much better. 'I will never forget this day. I hope to work hard, to train well, and to experience a lot of joy here. 'I know I am under a lot of pressure, but I am happy to face it.'

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . Sol Campbell's claims are just sinking in with Paul Ince when he starts rattling off the names of some England captains down the years. ‘There’s been me, Adams, Pearce, Seaman, Shearer, Terry, Ferdinand... that’s a lot of big names with a lot of big egos,’ declared Ince. ‘Sol’s a clever, articulate man and he’s a friend of mine but he wouldn’t have been England captain for 10 years — nobody is. Main man: Ince played 53 times for his country, scoring twice, and was England's first black captain . New dawn: Ince was made England's first black captain in 1993, and went on to skipper the side seven times . ‘He has obviously had different experiences to me as a footballer and I can only really talk about my own.’ Ince . knows what it takes to lead the country: a fiery, competitive warrior . who was first named  England captain in 1993 against the USA in Foxboro, . Massachusetts. He was the first black England player to wear the armband and yet Ince has mixed views about the stir it caused. ‘For . me it was the pinnacle of my career when Graham Taylor made me captain, . but I can remember feeling uncomfortable with the questions. Maestro: Former Liverpool and Manchester United midfielder Ince earned 53 England caps, scoring twice . Big names, big egos: Ince (left) believes the likes of Pearce (right) were made captain because of character . Rare: Campbell was captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received it long term . ‘I . just wanted to be the England captain, I didn’t want to be remembered . as the first black England captain because I didn’t look at it in that . way.

That meant a lot, to think that somehow I had inspired . people I had never even met.’ Campbell . has made some  startling claims, chief among them the idea that the . game’s governing body in this country is institutionally racist. The . former England defender, who was named captain three times during a . distinguished international career, has convinced himself that his . colour prevented him leading his country more often. Trusted: Ince was made captain for England's crucial World Cup qualifier in Rome against Italy by Glenn Hoddle . Wearing the armband: John Terry (left) barks instructions as Alan Shearer (right) celebrates scoring . ‘We can make too much of the captaincy and what it means,’ added Ince. ‘I . was captain of pretty much every team I played for — Manchester United, . Inter Milan, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Wolves and England — so my . colour didn’t come into it. ‘Sol is a friend of mine and he was around for Euro 96 under Terry Venables and again at the World Cup in 1998. ‘I . didn’t deal with the FA often enough, but there was never any issue . over my skin colour with my team-mates or people I came across within . the organisation. ‘I have no . reason to believe they are racist — who are we talking about? I loved . people like David Davies (former executive director at the FA) and I . just never  encountered it. ‘Sol . has every right to his view and we all have opinions, but in my . experience I just didn’t see it. I was an England player, an England . captain, I didn’t think about it.’ Friends: Campbell with former England captain Alan Shearer, who skippered his nation on 34 occasions . Skipper: Campbell with fellow centre-back Tony Adams, who captained England 15 times . Ince . captained England seven times, famously leading the country to the . World Cup finals in 1998 in a blood-stained shirt after a typically . combative performance alongside Paul Gascoigne against Italy in Rome. ‘Adams, . Gascoigne, Southgate, Wright and Sol all played in that game and I had a . responsibility to wear the armband against a very good Italy team. ‘I . can remember the night before the Italy game. I was with Ian Wright and . we were both so  nervous that we couldn’t sleep because we didn’t want . to let the country down the next night. ‘I . felt a responsibility to the country, but the captaincy would have . meant nothing to me if I didn’t have the respect of the other players. That was important to me. ‘My . England team-mates didn’t look at me and think, “Paul Ince is a black . England captain”, and neither did the manager. Why is that an issue? Leading the pack: Rio Ferdinand (front centre) is the only black player to be England's official leading captain . Influential: The former Tottenham, Arsenal and Portsmouth defender won 73 caps with England . ‘Glenn . Hoddle was the manager and he chose the person he felt could do the job . the best at that particular time — he could pick who he wanted. Glenn . was the manager and should have been for a lot longer.

He . went on to become a manager with Blackburn, Macclesfield and, most . recently, Blackpool but fears that a number of top, former black . England  players are being lost to the game. Ince, now 47, added: ‘We have lost a lot of good black players out of the game, such as Sol, Wright, Bright. ‘We . have to give them inspiration to stay involved because this is the 21st . century. I was 32 when I started thinking about what was next for me. Back then: Campbell celebrates scoring against Sweden in the 2002 World Cup .

"By . Martyn Herman . Greg Dyke claims the FA Council is ‘overwhelmingly male and white’ and says the issue must be tackled. The FA chairman told the Football Supporters’ Federation: ‘If you look at who’s supporting, who’s playing, and then at the FA council — it doesn’t represent them.’ In a pre-recorded video message, the former BBC director general Dyke, who took over from David Bernstein at the FA a year ago, said the governing body was in danger of becoming 'irrelevant'. Scroll down for video... 'Irrelevant': FA chairman says the FA Council is 'too white and too old' to represent football . 'If you look at who's supporting, who's playing, football and then you look at the FA Council - it doesn't represent them,' Dyke was quoted as saying on the BBC. 'It's still overwhelmingly male, overwhelmingly white in a world that isn't overwhelmingly male and white and somehow that has to be changed. 'We have to try and change it but we're not alone, supporters have got to try and change it as well.' The FA Council consists of around 120 members from both the professional and amateur circles of the game and are responsible for helping to make policy decisions for the organisation. Speaking out: Former England defender Sol Campbell has criticised the lack of diversity at the FA . The comments of Dyke, who once accused the BBC of being 'hideously white', come after criticism of the FA's lack of diversity by the likes of former England defender Sol Campbell. Campbell said in his biography this year that, had he been white, he would have captained England for 10 years. 'We've got to look at how we involve the population of 21st century England and the mix it's got,' said Dyke. 'If we just carry on like this - old, white males - we're going to be increasingly irrelevant.'","Greg Dyke has criticised the FA Council for being 'too white and too old'

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Manchester United defender Chris Smalling is confident he can slot perfectly into Louis van Gaal's first-team plans this season. Van Gaal has made it clear he wants United to line up in the 5-3-2 formation he used during the latter stages of the World Cup with Holland. With only three centre-halves on his books, Van Gaal has already admitted he needs reinforcements. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: The players have adapted well to new system . First impressions: Chris Smalling is keen to impress new Man United boss Louis van Gaal and secure a place in the starting XI ahead of the season . Heads you win: Smalling beats Baggio Husidic to the ball in the air during United's 7-0 rout of LA Galaxy in the first match of their US Tour . The former Holland manager is actively pursuing Thomas Vermaelen, Stefan de Vrij and Mats Hummels, although signing the latter is proving problematic as Borussia Dortmund do not want to sell another star this summer after losing striker Robert Lewandowski to Bayern Munich. Smalling started 21 Premier League games last term under David Moyes, but he has looked sharp in both friendlies on United's tour of the United States and he thinks Van Gaal's system suits him well. Smalling said: 'Being part of that formation means you have a lot of responsibility. 'We really have to go out there and attack and be nice and aggressive. I would like to think that's my game. 'I played in a back three when I was younger, not since I turned professional, but we are all picking it up and enjoying it. 'Communication is key, but we get on well so that's not really an issue.' Impress me: Louis van Gaal has stated that he is willing to give every member of United's squad a chance to show him what they can do . Golazo: Wayne Rooney scores from long range to set Manchester United on their way to a 3-2 win over Roma in their latest pre-season friendly . Van Gaal maintained his 100 per cent record as United boss with a 3-2 win over Roma on Saturday, but he was unhappy with his team's performance in Denver, accusing them of wasting possession. Despite having just three days' rest after the World Cup, Van Gaal has wasted no time implementing the rules that he thinks will turn United into winners again. The players have been told they must speak English to each other in an attempt to improve communication on and off the pitch. Rectangular tables have been replaced with circular ones in the dining halls on tour so the players are more likely to chat and bond over meals. Tour plans have been amended so United stay in hotels near to their training facilities and Van Gaal sits down with his coaches at 10:30pm every night to discuss the players' progress. 'It's all down to fine details,' Smalling added. 'He has the whole overview - on how we play, how we take set-plays, how we eat, how we rest. He has that all in hand.' Transfer target: United have been linked with Borussia Dortmund centre-back Mats Hummels (right) as they seek to strengthen their defence . Not impressed: Van Gaal was critical of United for being sloppy in possession during the Roma match . Smalling clearly admires his new manager greatly. 'He is a man who requires a lot of respect and we give him that because of what he has done and what he is like,' the England defender said. 'We are all trying to impress him, whether it's in training or in the hotel with how we conduct ourselves. 'He is a man we can learn a lot from.' Smalling admits the team should not be immune from criticism despite recording their second successive tour win. 'At times we were a bit sloppy and we need to work on that to make sure that we tidy that up,' he said. At the double: Wayne Rooney celebrates his second goal of the match with Juan Mata . But there could be no criticism from Smalling, or any of his team-mates, towards Wayne Rooney, who scored a stunning curler from 25 yards to put United ahead in Colorado. 'That's what special players can do,' Smalling added. 'He turns there and you think he has nowhere to go, but then it's in the top corner. 'It's that kind of class we are going to need this year.' United flew to Washington DC on Sunday ahead of their next match in the International Champions Cup against Inter Milan, which takes place on Tuesday.","Defender believes he can easily fit in to Van Gaal's plans at Man United .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Germany has become the first European country to recognise 'indeterminate sex' by allowing babies born with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as neither male nor female. The new regulation, which takes effect from today, stems from a study by the German Ethics Council into intersexuality that concluded that the rights of intersex individuals against irreversible medical interventions should be better protected. German passports, which currently bear an 'M' for male or 'F' for female, will soon be allowed to have an 'X' in the gender field, according to a spokesman for the interior ministry. 'If a child cannot be designated male . or female, then they should be entered on the birth register without . such a status,' the new law states. Born without sex: According to 2007 government figures, at least 150 intersex babies are born in Germany each year and 8,000 to 10,000 people have 'serious variations' from physical gender-defining characteristics . According to 2007 government figures, at least 150 intersex babies are born in Germany each year and 8,000 - 10,000 people have 'serious variations' from physical gender-defining characteristics. 'This will be the first time that the law acknowledges that there are human beings who are neither male nor female, or are both - people who do not fit into the traditional legal categories,' University of Bremen law professor Konstanze Plett told AFP. Support groups say the number of intersex individuals is far higher than government estimates, and point out the difficulties and subtleties of defining intersexuality physically or hormonally. 'We will have fellow human beings with no sex registered,' Plett said. 'They can't be forced into either one of the traditional sexes in these other contexts.' Creating a third gender would . complicate German laws on marriages and partnerships, which operate on a . binary male-female opposition, although the Ethics Council would . examine the implications for intersex individuals, he added. 'This . is an interesting move but it doesn't go far enough,' said Silvan . Agius, policy director at the Brussels-based rights group Equality for . lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people in Europe (ILGA). Concerns: A more immediate concern for intersex advocates is how children 'outed' at birth will fare in a world that operates largely on a gender binary . 'Unnecessary surgeries will likely continue in Germany with devastating consequences... we live in a world where having a baby classified as 'other' is still considered undesirable.' A more immediate concern for intersex advocates, he said, is how children 'outed' at birth will fare in a world that operates largely on a gender binary.' Schools have toilets for boys and . toilets for girls. Where will the intermediate child go?' added Mr . Agius. 'There are separate sports activities for boys and for girls, and . so many other things like this,' Agius said. 'The law doesn't change that. It does not immediately create a space for intersex people to be themselves.' Experts estimate the population of intersex people at one in 1,500 to 2,000 births. But advocates say the number is much larger partly due to difficulties in defining intersexuality physically or hormonally. The new law has already raised the profile of this small population, which could prompt increased awareness, but, some fear, could also trigger discrimination. 'It is an absolute must that parents, teachers and doctors be educated about the lives of intersex people,' said Lucie Veith, head of an intersex support group in Germany. 'The government must take measures to ensure that no children are discriminated against because of this new law.' A 2012 report from the Ethics Council quoted the case of an individual born in 1965 with no clear gender-defining genitalia but with testicles in their abdomen and male chromosomes. At the age of 2.5 months the individual was castrated without parental consent, a move which doctors later called a mistake. 'I'm not a man, nor a woman ... I remain a patchwork, made from doctors, injured and scarred. I have to reinvent myself if I want to continue to live,' the individual said. Australia has allowed citizens to note their gender on a passport as 'X' since 2011.","German passports will be able to have 'X' in gender field rather than 'M' or 'F'

"By . Thea Jourdan . When three-year-old Sophia Lister started complaining that the back of her jaw was hurting, her mother assumed the little girl's adult molars must have started to come through. 'I gave her some Calpol to help her sleep and waited for the pain to go,' says Solveig, 40, who works part-time as a financial director and is married to Chris, 43, an insurance underwriter. But the pain didn't ease, so two days later she took Sophia to the dentist. 'I nearly fainted when he told me that Sophia had serious decay in her baby teeth,' she recalls. 'I hadn't even noticed. I was mortified. She needed root canal work on one of her back teeth and fillings in three more. I kept thinking I must be a terrible mother to have let this happen.' Scroll down for video . Shocked: Solveig didn't realise the healthy snacks she had been giving to Sophia were ruining her teeth . But Solveig isn't the only middle-class mum horrified to discover her young child has severe tooth decay - a condition  more commonly associated with children living in poverty. According to new figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, almost 26,000 children in England aged between five and nine have been hospitalised for multiple tooth extractions in 2013-14 - that's the equivalent of almost 500 a week. Removal of rotten teeth is now the primary reason children in this age group are admitted to hospital. In some cases, dentists have no choice but to remove all 20 baby teeth from their young patients. And those from comfortable lifestyles are at just as much risk as youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds - with  middle-class parents feeding their children so-called 'healthy' snacks that cause more damage than junk foods, and working mums often too busy to take their children for check-ups. The legacy can be far more serious than just a phobia of going to the dentist. 'The best predictor of adult tooth decay is dental health at the age of five,' says Dr Mervyn Druian, a dentist who specialises in cosmetic dentistry and reconstruction. 'It's not something that disappears when your baby teeth fall out.' Dr Nicole Sturzenbaum, of Toothbeary Richmond, a private surgery in one of London's wealthiest boroughs that caters exclusively for the under-18s, has seen a steady increase in the number of children needing extensive dental work to save baby teeth since it opened in 2008. According to Dr Sturzenbaum, part of the problem is that parents think they are giving children 'healthy' foods and drinks, but it is these that can cause the most damage. 'Parents don't realise that fruit juices contain more sugar than cola,' she says. 'And many so-called healthy snacks are packed with sugar, too.' It's a trap that Solveig, from Haslemere in Surrey, admits she fell into with Sophia, who is now five. While she never let her little girl have sweets, she was happy to let her have apple juice in a 'sippy cup' beaker. Cavities are caused by two factors: decay, which occurs when bacteria in the mouth react with sugar, causing acids to form that soften and dissolve enamel; and acid erosion, which happens when acid in food or drink comes into direct contact with enamel. Although enamel on baby teeth is as hard as enamel on adult teeth, the layer is thinner, making children's teeth more vulnerable. Dr Sturzenbaum says that 'sippy cups' containing juice are a short cut to dental decay. 'Sipping on apple juice all day bathes your teeth in acid soup,' she says. 'It's doubly damaging because it's both sugary and acidic.' Smiling again: Now Solveig will stick to giving her daughter water instead of apple juice . It immediately made sense to Solveig: her son, who is 11, has no cavities - but he has always preferred to drink water. She also admits she wasn't as strict about dental check-ups as she might have been. Current advice is that a child should see a dentist at least once a year. 'I assumed Sophia's baby teeth would not cause too much trouble and that she could wait until she was older to go regularly to the dentist,' Solveig says. 'We did take her to the dentist after her teeth came through, but not often enough. Time flies by, and there's always work or school commitments getting in the way.' Then there are the dried fruit snacks - raisins, mango, apricots and the like - beloved by middle-class mums as a 'healthy' alternative to biscuits and crisps. Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, says they are a significant problem. 'Raisins are supposed to be healthy - one of your five-a-day - but they are concentrated forms of fructose, or fruit sugar, which reacts with bacteria in the mouth to create acid. 'They are sticky and cling to the space between the teeth, sometimes for an hour or more, all the time causing potential damage.' This is something that stay-at-home mum Clare O'Reilly, 35, from Plymouth, is all too aware of. While her eldest child Eddie, ten, and youngest, Annie, three, have had no problems, five-year-old Sammy first needed fillings at the age of three. Then, when he was four, he developed severe toothache as a result of an abscess beneath a decaying molar. His dentist carried out an emergency extraction under local anaesthetic. Since then, Sammy has had another molar removed . Clare says she always assumed she was doing the right thing with Sammy by encouraging him to eat lots of fruit and vegetables as a baby - and using sweet fruit to mask the taste of vegetables. 'I'd make him sweet potato and apricot, or stewed apple and spinach - and pat myself on the back believing he was getting the most nutritious food I could offer.' Growing problem: Almost 26,000 children in England aged between five and nine have been hospitalised for multiple tooth extractions in 2013-14 (picture posed by model) As a toddler, he liked fresh strawberries and mango, and he loved munching raisins while out and about in his pushchair. At the age of two, Clare took him to the dentist for the first time. 'The dentist told me he'd got ""pretty bad teeth"" and asked what I was feeding him,' she recalls. 'When I mentioned raisins, he told me I might as well be feeding him sugar cubes. 'Although I stopped him eating dried fruits straight away, Sammy continued to snack on fresh fruit - though I've recently stopped this, too. And I won't give him flavoured fromage frais now, because that’s packed with sugar.' She points out that many 'healthy' savoury snacks, such as breadsticks, wholemeal bread and bagels, also contain hidden sugar. Dr Carter says that it's not just the snacks themselves but the snacking habit that is dangerous. 'We've gone from three square meals a day to six or seven snacks,' he says. 'This means that teeth are constantly bathed in acid - giving no time for saliva to neutralise it and let the enamel recover.' Milk is another culprit. While many parents assume cow's milk is a wholesome drink, it too contains a type of sugar: lactose. Formula milks for children aged from one year upwards also contain added sugar. Decay is a particular problem if the milk is in contact with the teeth for extended periods. There is even a condition called 'bottle cavities' which develops because a child is left to constantly suck on a bottle of milk (usually to stop them crying). While people tend to assume that because they're 'just baby teeth' they don't matter, experts say the outcome can be a lifetime of poor dental health. Prevention: Dentists recommend children brush their teeth twice daily with a toothpaste containing fluoride . Dr Druian, who is based in North London, says it's not just that bad habits are set for life, but if a type of bacteria that leads to cavities gets a foothold in childhood, it can ruin a child's smile for life. 'There is an overlap period between the ages of five and nine when baby teeth and adult teeth exist in the mouth together,' he explains. 'So bacteria from decaying baby teeth will get to work on the adult teeth, too.' So what can parents do to stop their children developing cavities at such a young age? 'Proper tooth brushing, twice daily with a toothpaste containing fluoride, is vital,' says Professor Raman Bedi, dental public health consultant at King’s College London and chairman of the Global Child Dental Fund. Dr Sturzenbaum advises parents to give children water rather than fruit juice, and to cut down on snacking. She also says that parents have to take responsibility for brushing their children's teeth until at least age eight. Brushing should last at least two minutes twice a day, and she recommends that children floss from around the age of four.","Sophia Lister, five, had serious decay in her baby teeth and needed root canal work .

"By . Sebastian Shakespeare . Already wealthy from the inheritance left by his comedy legend father, sex offender Adam Barker is celebrating a new windfall. I hear that Ronnie Barker’s 45-year-old son has sold his London home for £550,000 — more than five times what it cost his father in 2001. The house, where Adam downloaded 1,675 pornographic images, mostly of young boys, on his computer, rocketed in value while Adam was on the run overseas and later in prison. Shamed: Adam Barker (pictured left with his mother Joy and comedian father Ronnie, right) has sold his London home for £550,000 . Following his 2003 arrest at the property in Ealing, he rented the house, which was bought for around £100,000, to tenants during the eight years after he jumped bail. Adam has gone to ground since he was released last year, a mere 14 weeks after being given a 12-month sentence for child porn offences. He pleaded guilty to 20 charges. The court heard that the illegal images on his computer included two at level five, the highest possible category. ‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children,’ said Judge Rosa Dean. ‘This wasn’t a one-off offending.’ Adam, who sold the house in February, has never commented on, apologised for, or attempted to explain his crimes. In court: Adam, pictured in an artist's impression at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, was given a 12-month sentence for child porn offences after he pleaded guilty to 20 charges . As a fugitive, he did not attend the funeral of his father, who died in 2005 aged 76, or collect his share of the £275,000 in cash (the maximum tax-free sum) that Barker left his children. Instead, the money was set aside, to be collected on his return. But Adam’s biggest windfall came after the death of his mother, Joy, in 2011. Her estate, which included the bulk of Ronnie’s former assets, was valued at £6.5 million. Along with his actress sister Charlotte, 52, and advertising executive brother, Larry, 54, Adam is heir to a share of the earnings from The Two Ronnies star’s back catalogue. The three are joint shareholders in a company, Handles For Forks Ltd, named after Ronnie’s most famous sketch, set up to administer those earnings. Because he is on the sex offenders’ register, Adam must notify police of his full-time address. Companies House documents state his correspondence address as the Cotswolds but he is not believed to live there.

The needles are inserted at 2.5cm intervals around the wound - the Chinese, where the alternative treatment was first used, call this ‘ringing the dragon’. The procedure requires the animal to stay still, so they need to be under a general anaesthetic and it is only done when absolutely necessary. Acupuncture uses thin needles to treat a range of conditions, most commonly pain relief. A form of complementary medicine and a key component of traditional Chinese medicine, it is thought to have developed thousands of years ago. The zoo said the signs are that Lucifer will make a swift recovery.","Lucifer the lion had treatment to ease pain of earlier tumour removal .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sally Lee . When Dante Exum was born his father Cecil, who used to play alongside Michael Jordon during college, took a basketball to the Melbourne hospital and placed it in his son's tiny hands. It ignited a lifelong fascination with the sport that has now made him a multi-millionaire, after the 18-year-old was drafted by NBA franchise the Utah Jazz, signing a two-year deal worth just over $9 million. The 198cm tall point guard, dubbed 'The Boy Wonder from Down Under' and 'International Man of Mystery' by US media, was selected by the Jazz with the fifth pick in New York, and announced: 'I'm just a kid from Melbourne, Australia.' Exum joins fellow Aussies Andrew Bogut (Golden State Warriors), Patty Mills (San Antonio Spurs), Aron Baynes (Spurs) and Matthew Dellavedova (Cleveland Cavaliers) in the NBA. Scroll down for video . Australian teenager Dante Exum, from Melbourne, was the 5th pick in the US National Basketball Association draft. He shakes the hand of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver in New York . The 198cm tall point guard, dubbed 'The Boy Wonder from Down Under' and 'International Man of Mystery' by US media, was selected by the Utah Jazz on Thursday in New York . Bogut was selected number one overall in 2005, as was Melbourne-born Kyrie Irving in 2011 - while Mills was crowned an NBA champion just days ago when his team the San Antonio Spurs beat LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the Finals series. The 18-year-old was considered a wildcard in the draft held in Brooklyn, New York, because he didn't play US college basketball and most NBA executives, coaches and scouts had never seen him play a game in person. 'I'm just a kid from Melbourne, Australia,' said Exum later, dressed in a grey suit and with a Jazz cap on his head. 'I guess right now I just got drafted so I guess I'm not a mystery anymore.' Exum was expected to go to the 76ers with the third pick, or possibly No.1 with the Cleveland Cavaliers, but slid down to the Jazz. Cecil Exum (pictured in the #50 jersey, fourth from right) celebrates beating Maryland to win the Atlantic Coast Conference Championship game in 1981 with the University of North Carolina - for whom Michael Jordan also played . Exum played Australian rules growing up but he says his dad, who used to play with Michael Jordon, steered him to basketball . The 18-year-old retweeted an old snap of himself with the Keilor Thunder basketball team in Melbourne . The 76ers are mentored by former Australian Olympic coach Brett Brown but the team went for University of Kansas centre Joel Embiid. The Orlando Magic also passed on Exum with the fourth pick. The Cleveland Cavaliers used their No.1 selection on another Kansas player, forward Andrew Wiggins, while the Milwaukee Bucks took Duke forward Jabari Parker second. Exum has already cashed in with major endorsement deals with companies including adidas and Red Bull. He will sign a two-year contract with the Jazz worth about $US4.5 million ($A4.87 million) each year.

The teenager attended Lake Ginninderra Secondary College in Canberra in conjunction with the Australian Institute of Sport.

"By . Mark Prigg . Girls who post pictures of themselves in revealing outfits online are seen as less attractive by other females, researchers have found. They discovered those who post sexy or revealing photos on social media sites such as Facebook are viewed by their female peers as less physically and socially attractive and less competent to perform tasks. Researchers set up a series of fake Facebook profiles to test their findings. Women who post revealing snaps are viewed by their female peers as less attractive, and less competent. Researchers created two mock Facebook profiles for the fictitious 20-year-old Amanda Johnson. In both versions, Amanda liked musicians such as Lady Gaga, books such as 'Twilight,' and movies like 'The Notebook,' that would be appropriate for a person her age. The only difference between the two was the profile photo. The photos were actual high school senior portrait and prom photos of a real young woman who allowed the photos to be used for the experiment. In the sexy photo, “Amanda” is wearing a low-cut red dress with a slit up one leg to mid-thigh and a visible garter belt. In the non-sexy photo, she’s wearing jeans, a short-sleeved shirt and a scarf draped around her neck, covering her chest. 'This is a clear indictment of sexy social media photos, said Elizabeth Daniels of the Oregon State University, who led the study. 'There is so much pressure on teen girls and young women to portray themselves as sexy, but sharing those sexy photos online may have more negative consequences than positive,' Daniels said. Girls and young women are in a 'no-win' situation when it comes to their Facebook photos, Daniels said. Those who post sexy photos may risk negative reactions from their peers, but those who post more wholesome photos may lose out on social rewards, including attention from boys and men, she said. 'Social media is where the youth are,” she said. 'We need to understand what they’re doing online and how that affects their self-concept and their self-esteem.'Daniels’ research was published today in the journal 'Psychology of Popular Media Culture.' Participants were asked to assess Amanda’s physical attractiveness (I think she is pretty), social attractiveness (I think she could be a friend of mine), and task competence (I have confidence in her ability to get a job done) on a scale from 1-7, with one being strongly disagree and 7 being strongly agree. Those who post sexy photos may risk negative reactions from their peers, but those who post more wholesome photos may lose out on social rewards, including attention from boys and men, she said. In all three areas, the non-sexy profile scored higher, indicating that those who viewed that photo thought Amanda was prettier, more likely to make a good friend and more likely to complete a task. The largest difference was in the area of task competence, suggesting a young woman’s capabilities are really affected by the sexy photo, Daniels said. 'We really need to help youth understand this is a very public forum,' she said. Daniels’ advice for girls and young women is to select social media photos that showcase their identity rather than her appearance, such as one from a trip or one that highlights participation in a sport or hobby. 'Don’t focus so heavily on appearance,' Daniels said. 'Focus on who you are as a person and what you do in the world.'","Researchers set up a series of fake Facebook profiles to test their findings .

This next-generation HMD also includes a cutting-edge tracking system that ensures the pilot’s exact head position and the aircraft computer system are continuously in sync. Scroll down for video . BAE Systems Striker II has integrated night vision cameras, and know exactly where a pilot is looking . The Striker II has a tiny digital camera which turns night into day for pilots using a sensor mounted in the middle of the helmet. It projects an image on to the pilot’s visor in 1280x1060 high-definition resolution, along with other critical information such as speed, weapons and target. The Striker II also tracks the position of the helmet and projects the information on to a pilot’s visor. This means that no matter where the pilot looks, they still see the data in the same place. 'As the industry transitions from analogue to digital display solutions, Striker II brings a superior, fully digital capability to multiple platform types,' said Joseph Senftle, vice president and general manager for Communications and Controls Solutions at BAE Systems. 'Designed to address evolving mission requirements with advanced digital night vision technology, our new HMD was built to be ‘future proof’ and seamlessly adaptable to technology advancements in the years ahead.' Instead of night vision goggles, the Striker II has a digital night vision camera inside the helmet, which helps reduce g-force effects on the pilot's head and neck to improve comfort, and eliminates the need to change equipment at night. The Striker II is a fully digital helmet which has target tracking technology within a fully integrated visor-projected HMD system. The Striker II tracking system eliminates any delay in determining where the pilot is looking and can therefore perfectly position datav onto the visor.

"By . Associated Press . and Mark Prigg . Apple could be forced to refund customers up to $400 million in a settlement over digital book price fixing. The settlement emerged in a court filing made a month after attorneys suing Apple notified U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York that an agreement had been reached to avoid a trial over the issue. Lawsuits filed on behalf of digital book buyers had originally been seeking damages of up to $840 million after Cote ruled in a separate trial last year that Apple had violated U.S. antitrust law by orchestrating a price-fixing scheme with five major publishers of electronic books. FILE - In this Dec. 7, 2011 file photo, a person stands near the Apple logo at the company's store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. Apple will refund up to $400 million to consumers ensnared in a plot to raise the prices of digital books unless the company overturns a court decision affirming its pivotal role in the collusion. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Millions of electronic book buyers will be eligible for refunds if Cote's decision is upheld, though the precise number wasn't spelled out. More than 23 million consumers received notices of a $166 million settlement previously reached with the five book publishers found to be conspiring with Apple. Those publishers are Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillian, Penguin and Simon & Schuster. Consumers who bought e-books from those five publishers from April 1, 2010 through May 21, 2012 will be eligible for a slice of the settlement fund. To qualify, the consumers also must have lived in in one of the 19 states covered in a class action lawsuit or Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa or the Northern Marina Islands at the time of the purchase. Cote's decision sided with the U.S. Justice Department's contention that Apple's late CEO, Steve Jobs, had schemed with major e-book publishers to charge higher prices in response to steep discounts offered by Amazon.com Inc. Jobs, who died in October 2011, negotiated the deals as Apple was preparing to release the first iPad in 2010. Apple is appealing Cote's decision from last year. The Cupertino, California, company won't have to pay the $400 million settlement if it prevails. If the appeals court voids Cote's verdict and returns the case to her for further review, Apple would still have to refund $50 million to consumers. No money will be owed if the appeals court concludes that Apple didn't break any antitrust laws. 'Apple did not conspire to fix e-book pricing, and we will continue to fight those allegations on appeal,' the company said in a statement. 'We did nothing wrong and we believe a fair assessment of the facts will show it.' A decision on Apple's appeal, now in the Second Circuit in New York, might not be issued for another year, according to Wednesday's filing. Consumer attorneys in the case are still hoping to get Cote's preliminary approval of the settlement. If its appeal is rejected, it would be more of a blow to Apple's image than its finances. The company can easily afford to refund the money, given it has about $150 billion in cash. Millions of electronic book buyers will be eligible for refunds if Cote's decision is upheld, though the precise number wasn't spelled out Wednesday.

Some of the settlement proceeds also will be distributed by the attorneys general in 33 states and territories involved in the case. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman estimated e-book buyers in his state could receive up to $28 million in refunds from Apple. 'This settlement proves that even the biggest, most powerful companies in the world must play by the same rules as everyone else,' he said. Besides the consumer compensation, Apple also will pay $50 million in lawyer fees unless it wins its appeal. Of that amount, $20 million would be paid to the attorneys general to cover their costs and the remainder would go to class-action lawyers led by Steve W. Berman of the Seattle law firm Hagens Berman.

"By . Mark Prigg . Google is setting up a crack team of hackers to protect internet users from government snooping and cyber attacks. The firm says its 'project zero' will look at everything from accidental flaws in code, known as zero day bugs, to major government operations. It also aims to make Google's own service more secure, and make encryption easier for people to use. Google's 'project zero' will look at everything from accidental flaws in code to major government operations, and the search giant said users 'should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state-sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer, steal secrets or monitor your communications.' 'Every bug we discover will be filed in an external database. 'We will only report bugs to the software's vendor—and no third parties. 'Once the bug report becomes public (typically once a patch is available), you'll be able to monitor vendor time-to-fix performance, see any discussion about exploitability, and view historical exploits and crash traces. 'We also commit to sending bug reports to vendors in as close to real-time as possible, and to working with them to get fixes to users in a reasonable time.' Source: Google . 'You should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state-sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer, steal secrets or monitor your communications,' Google's Chris Evans, who is leading the project, said. 'Security is a top priority for Google. 'We've invested a lot in making our products secure, including strong SSL encryption by default for Search, Gmail and Drive, as well as encrypting data moving between our data centers. 'Beyond securing our own products, interested Googlers also spend some of their time on research that makes the Internet safer, leading to the discovery of bugs like Heartbleed.' The success of that part-time research led the firm to set up Project Zero. 'In sophisticated attacks, we see the use of 'zero-day' vulnerabilities to target, for example, human rights activists or to conduct industrial espionage.' So-called 'zero-day; exploits take advantage of unpatched flaws that programmers have not had time to fix. There is a thriving black market for the exploits, which can often be sold for thousands of dollars. Google says it is already hiring hackers for the project, and urged more to get in touch. 'This needs to stop. We think more can be done to tackle this problem. 'We're hiring the best practically-minded security researchers and contributing 100% of their time toward improving security across the Internet. Speaking to Wired, Evans said the project would also target malware downloaded via website. 'People deserve to use the internet without fear that vulnerabilities out there can ruin their privacy with a single website visit, . 'We’re going to try to focus on the supply of these high value vulnerabilities and eliminate them.' Recently, the NSA was accused of keeping details about the colossal Heartbleed bug hidden before it was eventually caught in part by Google’s researchers and patched.","Will look at everything from accidental flaws in code to major government snooping operations .

"By . Tara Brady . A woman who cheated benefits despite inheriting £115,000 from her wrestling champ dad has been spared jail. Four days after making claims for income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit, Samantha Jordan received a fortune from the estate of her late dad, Mike ‘Flash’ Jordan, the Ancoats wrestler who won a lightweight world championship title back in 1987. Manchester Crown Court heard Ms Jordan got the money on reaching her 21st birthday, seven years after the death of her father, who appeared in bouts televised on ITV’s ‘World of Sport’ in his Eighties heyday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught: Samantha Jordan cheated benefits despite inheriting £115,000 from her wrestling champ father . Instead of revealing it to the Department of Work and Pensions, Jordan set about ‘blowing’ the bequest with pals, the court heard. By the time the DWP learnt of it, she had claimed £15,000 in benefits. Jordan, from Moston, admitted charges of failing to declare a change in circumstances and was sentenced to a 12-month community order, 100 hours of unpaid work, and a requirement to attend a probation service programme. Paul Hodgkinson, prosecuting, told the court that Jordan, 25, ‘must have known’ the bequest was imminent when she made the benefit claims. Ms Jordan got the money on reaching her 21st birthday, seven years after the death of her father Mike . He pushed for Proceeds of Crime Act hearings which would look at whether she had any assets - or whether she really had ‘blown the lot’. Kirstin Beswick, defending, said: 'Her father died when she was 14 - he was to a great degree an absent father. 'She did know he left her some money, but she wasn’t entitled to it until her 21st birthday and had no idea how much that was. Mike Flash Jordan in action: The wrestler appeared in bouts televised on ITV's World of Sport in the 1980s . 'Her father was a professional wrestler and he had obviously managed to accumulate rather more money than she had ever seen in her lifetime.' Ms Beswick said Jordan got the money at a time when she was ‘naive’ and ‘heavily pregnant’. He added: 'She’s not spent it on anything worthwhile. All her friends helped her spend it, not a single one said ""I think you ought to do something else with it, for you and your son"".' Deputy Judge Robert Brown, sentencing, said: 'It was a very, very stupid thing which you did with the money that you got from your father, squandering it in that very short period of time. 'You will no doubt have to live with the consequences for a considerable time indeed - until you have paid off the money that you owe to the department.'","Samantha Jordan received a fortune from her dad Mike 'Flash' Jordan .

"By . Mark Prigg . A study from the University of Washington that polled 127 Snapchat users ages 18 and over found that 60 percent of respondents used Snapchat primarily to send 'funny content' Snapchat may have a reputation as a sexting app for teens, but in reality, you're far more likely to find cat pictures and selfies, researchers have found. A study from the University of Washington polled 127 Snapchat users ages 18 and over. It found that 60% of respondents used Snapchat primarily to send 'funny content,' while the second most popular type of 'snap' is a selfie. Fourteen percent of those surveyed said they'd previously sent sexts over Snapchat, but just 1.6 percent said they do so regularly. Snapchat, which allows people to exchange messages that self-destruct seconds after they're viewed, has attracted an estimated 82 million users, most of whom are between ages 13 and 25. The survey also found that many users did not care about relative insecurity of pictures sent using the app. 'We surveyed 127 adult Snapchatusers, finding that security is not a major concern for the majority of these respondents,' the researchers wrote. 'We learn that most do not use Snapchat to sendsensitive content (although up to 25% may do so experimentally), that taking screenshots is not generally a violation of the sender's trust but instead common and expected, that most respondents understand that messages can be recovered, and that security and privacy concerns are overshadowed by other influences on how and why respondents choose to use or not use Snapchat.' University of Washington researchers found that 60 percent of respondents used Snapchat primarily to send 'funny content,' while the second most popular type of message is a selfie . Snapchat, which allows people to exchange messages that self-destruct seconds after they're viewed, has attracted an estimated 82 million users, most of whom are between ages 13 and 25. At the end of 2013 it was estimated that Snapchat had over 26 million users in the US alone, with many others around the world.And in a survey of American college students in February, 77% said they used Snapchat on a daily basis.But the company still apparently holds only 5% of the 'selfie' market, with this move perhaps an attempt to keep them in the game. The team also found the majority of users tried the app because they thought it would be fun - rather than actually wanting to send salacious material. 'Respondents more commonly respond that they use Snapchat because it is fun, not because of its implied or actual security properties. 'Indeed, most respondents understand that Snapchat's message destruction is insecure, but they do not send sensitive messages (such as sexual or legally questionable content) more commonly because they don't produce such content than because they don't trust Snapchat or their friends.' A majority of respondents in the UW study (53 percent) had screen shots taken of their messages at some point, and slightly fewer (47 percent) had taken screen shots themselves. Five people admitted to using a separate camera to photograph a message, which prevents the sender from knowing his or her photo was captured. However, most people didn't seem to mind that their 'snaps' were saved. Snapchat Chief executive officer (CEO) Evan Spiegel: Researchers say the firm's product is used for 'fun' messages rather than sexting . When asked how they reacted to having a screen shot taken of their message, respondents ""more commonly chose answer choices indicating neutral ('didn't care') or positive ('thought it was funny') reactions,"" according to the report. Despite the relative infrequency of sexting among the survey's sample of users, the researchers found that Snapchat has a reputation for illicit messages that was discouraging some from downloading the app. Among the 61 people who started the survey but failed to complete it because they hadn't used Snapchat, several expressed concerns about the 'additional connotations' of the app. Snapchat 'has a bad reputation (for sexting),' said one. Another said it 'seems useful for only inappropriate content.' The researchers alos said they believed that there was a market for a more secure chat app. 'Nevertheless, we observe that a non-negligible fraction (but not a majority) of respondents adapt their behavior in response to Snapchat's weak security properties, and thus conclude that these users may still have a use for a more secure messaging application in addition to the more casual, fun-focused Snapchat.","60 per cent of users said they used Snapchat for 'fun content'

"By . Tara Brady . Carer: Tanya Vasileva looked after her friend Gertrude Stanley before she died in 2009 . The carer of a Holocaust survivor has won her right to an inheritance following a court battle against a TV 'heir hunter' who claimed she was a 'trespasser'. Tanya Vasileva looked after her friend Gertrude Stanley who had made London her home after fleeing Vienna just before the start of the Second World War. Mrs Stanley died aged 89 believing she had no living relatives. Her sister had died in a concentration camp. Mrs Stanley promised to leave her Hampstead flat to Miss Vasileva in return for the years of care she had selflessly given her. However, she made no will and a legal wrangle ensued after professional genealogist, Peter Birchwood - who has appeared on the BBC series, Heir Hunters - traced two distant cousins of Mrs Stanley. During a hearing in London, the court heard Mrs Stanley had experienced the horror of fleeing from Vienna and arrived in London in May 1939, when she was just 19. She and her husband, Lawrence, lived together in their flat, in Haverstock Hill, Belsize Park, north London, for 48 years, until his death in 1994. The couple never had any children and her sister, who also tried to escape Vienna but was captured, was dead. Mrs Stanley believed she had no blood relatives left alive. The court heard that despite her sizeable fortune, most of which was discovered in bank accounts and shares following her death, the widow lived a humble existence and often worried she would run out of money. She was also a hoarder and her obsession with keeping everything meant she still had the suitcases her sister had packed for her escape bid as well as her husband’s wartime army uniform. Miss Vasileva cared part-time for the widow since 2005 while also holding down two jobs and moved into her flat. Mrs Stanley died in December 2009. Acting on behalf of Mrs Stanley’s estate, Mr Birchwood argued Miss Vasileva was a ‘trespasser’ who should be ousted from the property and made to pay £50,000 for her years of rent-free occupation. However, a judge ruled Mrs Stanley did promise the flat to her carer and said Miss Vasileva had ‘done her best’ to look after the widow in her final years. Judge Mark Raeside QC awarded Miss Vasileva £20,000 from the estate and dismissed Mr Birchwood’s financial claim against her. Payout: Miss Vasileva cared part-time for the widow from 2005 while also holding down two jobs . But the judge also ruled that the ‘value’ of the free care provided by Miss Vasileva was only £70,000 - not the £160,000 value of the flat - and said she would have to leave her home in December so it could go back to the estate. Speaking after the case Miss Vasileva said: 'I looked after her but we weren’t just friends, we were more like grandmother and granddaughter, we were very close. 'She was an extremely intelligent woman and I have some lovely memories of our time together. She will always be in my heart.' The court heard that Mrs Stanley met Miss Vasileva who had moved to the UK from Bulgaria in 2002 at her local supermarket where the younger woman worked. The 39-year-old described the touching friendship they struck up after she began helping the pensioner by delivering her shopping. The two would regularly go to a hotel near her flat where the pensioner - a classically-trained pianist - would entertain guests by playing. Miss Vasileva said: 'Gertrude loved music and she was an incredible pianist, she played by ear. She could play anything, things she heard on the radio, and she loved to play. 'She had arthritis in her hands and she struggled with them, but when she played it was like she forgot all of her pain.' TV heir hunter Peter Birchwood . However, she also suffered from anxiety and had an ‘obsessive’ personality, which led to her hoarding vast amounts of clutter, leaving her home in a squalid state. Miss Vasileva, who has a masters degree in computing, helped her to clear the flat and would also take her to hospital and doctors’ appointments. The court heard that in May 2005, following a two-month stay in hospital, Mrs Stanley phoned Miss Vasileva and asked if she could come and collect her from hospital because she had no-one else. The widow was adamant she did not want any professional carers and asked her young friend if she would help her so she could stay in her own flat. Miss Vasileva told the court: 'She said she was capable of doing things herself and she knew what she wanted - she was very strong-minded.' According to Miss Vasileva, it was at this time that Mrs Stanley first said she wanted her to have the flat when she died. She said Mrs Stanley repeated the promise may more times. Her barrister, Gavin Hamilton, said: 'Miss Vasileva was the only person she knew who was young, female and willing to care for her.' He said while she continued working at the supermarket and had a cleaning job, she also provided daily care to Mrs Stanley from then onwards - with the level of care increasing as the pensioner’s health deteriorated. Miss Vasileva would cook and clean for her, bathe her, change her bedding and get her out of bed on a morning - which she could not do on her own - and continued to do so until Mrs Stanley went into a care home in April 2009.

Arguing that the pensioner’s promise to her should be honoured, Miss Vasileva told the court: 'The fact is she wanted to leave me the flat - what else should I have considered; that was her wish. 'There was a high level of trust in the relationship we had and she was a person who honoured her word, she never lied to me. 'She said I should not worry about it, everything is going to be arranged for.' 'I am, in all the circumstances, satisfied that this promise was made by the deceased to Miss Vasileva on the day on which she was discharged from hospital' Judge Raeside . Mr Birchwood denied she was entitled to the flat and argued she should have to pay rent for the time she had lived there. Ruling in Miss Vasileva’s favour, Judge Raeside found Mrs Stanley did promise her the flat, but said the £160,000 property was ‘disproportionate’ for the part-time care she had provided. He concluded that, based on the level of care and the length of time it was given, she was entitled to £70,000. The judge said the time she had already spent living in the flat was worth about £50,000 and therefore the estate should pay the other £20,000. He also awarded Miss Vasileva all of her legal costs out of the estate. The judge said: 'I am, in all the circumstances, satisfied that this promise was made by the deceased to Miss Vasileva on the day on which she was discharged from hospital. Gertrude Stanley entertaining guests at the Britannia Hotel in Hampstead, London where she also lived . 'I am also satisfied there is a sufficient nexus between the promise made by the deceased and the activities carried out by Miss Vasileva thereafter.' Giving her six months before she has to leave the flat, he added: 'I am not going to force this lady out of this flat, this has been her home for some time and this is what the deceased asked should happen. 'I have decided that she should get a sum of money instead of two more years in the property, but to force her out of her home under pressure strikes me as quite wrong - this is her home.'","Tanya Vasileva looked after Gertrude Stanley in Hampstead, London .

Grey squirrels, originally from North America, were released in the UK by 19th century landowners. They are now very common and widespread. Grey squirrels are active during the day, foraging for food in trees and on the ground – they often visit peanut feeders in gardens. In the autumn they spend time storing nuts to eat during the winter. They also tend to breed in between January and April and, if food is plentiful, they may have a second litter in the summer. They are extremely successful and have replaced our native red squirrels over most of the UK.","Animals take part in assault course made up of twists, jumps and turns .

"By . James  Nye . Charged: Kisha Young, the 38-year-old driver and mother to some of the children, was arrested on suspicion of intoxication assault, a third-degree felony . A Texas woman who didn't want six children to ride inside her car with wet bathing suits is facing charges of intoxication assault after four of them were injured - one seriously. According to Cowley Police Department, Kisha Young, 39, asked the kids aged between eight and 14 to ride on the trunk and hood of her Chevrolet Malibu for the one-minute journey home after a playdate at the Creekside Community Pool. Witnesses who saw the unusual sight said that the children were flung from the car at a tight corner and Young kept on driving - apparently unaware that her passengers had come off the vehicle. Young, the 38-year-old driver and mother to some of the children, was arrested on suspicion of intoxication assault, a third-degree felony. Additional charges are expected to be sought against Young and the 31-year-old mother of the other children involved, who was a passenger in the front seat, said officer C.C. Meadows, a spokeswoman with the Crowley Police Department. Crews were dispatched to the 400 block of Angler Drive in the suburb of Crowley in Fort Worth around 8.30 pm. Incident: The children came off the car at the 400 block of Angler Drive in Crowley, about 15 minutes from downtown Fort Worth, about 8:30 p.m . 'Officers were advised that the driver and passenger of the vehicle mothers of the children allowed the children to ride outside the vehicle because their clothes were wet,' police the department stated in a news release to The Star Telegram. Spokeswoman C.C. Meadows, said that the investigation is trying to determine exactly what caused the children to come off the car, but they suspect alcohol and driver error. Young was taken into custody after failing a breathalyzer test on the spot - however, they are waiting for the results of her blood tests. Three of the children were taken to Cook Children's Medical Center. A 12-year-old girl with a severe head injury - who is Young's daughter - was taken to a Fort Worth Hospital by helicopter. Playdate: The children were at he Creekside Community Pool, according to police . Short distance: The journey should have taken less than a minute . 'It’s my understanding that all have been released with exception to the one who was CareFlited,' Meadows said, who added that the 12-year-old's condition is 'touch and go'. 'Well of course we don't know what they were thinking,' said Meadows. 'However, they weren't thinking safety.' Neighbor, Demi Garcia told NBCDFW that she saw the accident. 'The mom started backing up after my dad ran over there to the kids. Cause they were trying to lift up the little girl,' she said. Neighbors said they were shocked by what happened. 'Anybody, they can’t be in their right mind to do that with their own kids!' said Geneva Carpenter, who lives on the street where the incident happened. 'Who in their right mind thinks a little kid can hang on to a hood? You can’t hang onto a hood,' Carpenter said to NBCDFW. Child Protective Services has been contacted and is expected to investigate.","Kisha Young, 39, has been charged with intoxication assault after making six children ride on trunk and hood .

"By . Mark Prigg . Scroll down for video . Apple's iPhone 6 will monitor exactly how far its owner walks each day - and even how much caffeine they drink. The latest test version of Apple's new Health app adds to the blood pressure, temperature and pulse monitoring features shown off by Apple earlier this year. The app called HealthKit even offers the ability to send data to your family doctor. Apple's iPhone will track everything from sleep to calories - and even how much caffeine you drink . ‘Developers have created a vast array of healthcare devices,’ said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering. ‘But until now, the information lives in silos.’ The firm is working with dozens of medical firms so that doctors can see a patient's data - and even get an alert if something is wrong. 'You choose what you want shared. For example, you can allow the data from your blood pressure app to be automatically shared with your doctor,' Apple said. It will rely on additional equipment, such as a wrist-strap  heart monitor that connects wirelessly to the iPhone. It is not yet known how the app will track caffeine - and could rely on users telling it how much they drink. Expert say the move could make it easier for new owners to start tracking their health. 'Adding on-device tracking support to the Health app is a significant addition from Apple as iPhone 5s (and future iPhone) customers will no longer even need to integrate any App Store apps or hardware devices to begin using the software,' said Mark Gurman of 9to5mac. 'Steps is one of the more mainstream categories of fitness data, so the ability for the iPhone to provide that data out of the box is a great way to teach people about the Health fitness tracking software. The new Health App will use a special dashboard to show user's exactly how their health is - and can alert doctors if something is wrong . The apphas sections that can track data for bloodwork, heart rate, hydration, blood pressure, physical activity, nutrition, blood sugar, sleep, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and weight. Apple is  currently be testing the Healthbook software with iOS 8, the next version of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch operating system. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said a key feature of the app was its ability to send an automatic alert to a doctor if vital signs approach dangerous levels. It comes as iPhone maker Foxconn has revealed Apple's new iPhone 6 could be the first to be made using its 'robot army'. The firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and CEO Terry Gou has revealed the robots, dubbed 'Foxbots', are in the final stages of testing. It is believed Foxconn will install 10,000 robots as a test. Workers are seen inside a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province. The firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build Apple's latest iPhone. Lines dedicated to Apple devices getting first priority, according to IT Home. It says Gou told a shareholder meeting that Apple would be the first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that its next product - the iPhone 6 - will be manufactured in this way. Each $25,000 Foxbot can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year it has been claimed. Foxconn, which currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across China. However, the firm's robot initiative has been delayed since it was first announced in 2011. At the time, Gou said the company had about 10,000 units already in operation, a number that was supposed to rise to 300,000 in 2012, then one million by 2014. An image last week, also leaked by Sonny Dickson, revealed the two new iPhone 6 models side-by-side . However, the firm is also ramping up human workers for the iPhone 6, with 100,00 being hired according to some reports. Dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6. They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back. However, a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen.","New Apple HealthKit app offers ability to send data to family doctor .

"By . James  Nye . A Tulsa woman who stabbed her six-year-old son to death while suffering a serious breakdown is to be released from a mental health facility after serving an eight-year sentence. Sheilla Shea, 49, took son Patric's life on July, 2005, after suffering a mental breakdown brought about because of the abusive relationship she was in at the time. She was discovered sitting on a curb on the sidewalk by police covered in the blood of young son and is only able to now confront her actions that day as she prepares to be released. 'I will forever have to live with myself and what I did,' said Shea to Tulsa World. Tragedy: Sheilla Shea killed her little boy Patric (right) after falling mentally ill after he marriage disintegrated in July 2005 . Shea was desperate to leave her husband, but cracked waiting for her mother and her sister to come and collect her and the children. She was stopped from killing her two other children, aged 10 and 12, by her adult son after he saw the 'silhouette of his mother stabbing downward' in the bedroom and wrestled the knife from her. 'Sometimes I think: What if we would have made it to Texas? What if this? What if that?” Shea said to Tulsa World. 'They missed me by seven hours. … I couldn’t hang on.' Now, nearly eight years after she was sentenced, Shea has had her release approved by Tulsa County District Judge James Caputo. In his release order, Caputo noted that Shea had been 'very compliant' and is following all the recommended medical advice to stop a repeat of her illness. 'Somebody asked me if I was going to celebrate, and I said, ‘It is not a celebration,’ she said. 'It’s hard to be sane and know what I did,' Shea said. 'It’s not a celebration. It’s me trying to find peace with what I did.' When she was arrested nine-years ago, Shea wanted to end all her suffering and asked her lawyer to put in no defense. 'I wanted to die,' Shea said. 'I wanted the lethal injection. I begged her.' Release: Sheilla will be released from the Oklahoma Forensic Center in Tulsa after serving eight-years of her prison sentence . However, the court determined that Shea was insane when she took her sons life and prosecutors did not object to the verdict and eventual plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Now as she prepares to leave Oklahoma Forensic Center custody, Shea feels that her recovery is going well. 'During this whole process, she lost her mom,' Shena Burgess, her public defender from 2006 said. 'She dealt with it really well. She handled it better than someone who had never had any mental illness.' Family: Sheilla and her family (Patric is seen, front center) pose for a picture before the collapse of Shea's marriage . Buried: Sheilla Shea's brother and son's graves in Tulsa, Oklahoma . 'She’s really proven not only to the staff of OFC and to the board but also me how much she has changed,' Burgess said. 'She realizes she has a mental illness and that she has to live with this and she has to be medicated and she has to have the support of counseling and family for the rest of her life.'Shea said she thinks about what she calls the 'tragic event' every day.'Sometimes it’s really hard to live with what I did,' she said. 'It’s awful. It’s something I will have to live with for the rest of my life, and I try to find peace within myself to be able to live with myself.'","Sheilla Shea, 49, stabbed her son Patric to death in 2005 while in the throes of a mental breakdown .

"By . James  Nye . and Corey Charlton . One of the models whose account of an encounter with Terry Richardson appears in New York magazine's controversial profile piece on the photographer has decided to set the record straight on what really happened that day. In Benjamin Wallace's cover story, model Sena Cech, is portrayed as a somewhat naive teenage model, who 'laughs' when Richardson presents his penis to her during a photo-shoot and is asked to 'twist and squeeze it really hard'. In a written response made public on Monday, Cech refutes this account of the session which happened when she was 19, describing instead Richardson's nudity as ambush-like and even more disturbingly says the 'experience was not consensual. It was revolting and humiliating.' She even goes on to describe him as a 'poor sick man.' Scroll Down for Video . Setting the record straight: Model Sena Cech has written a strong denial regarding the circumstances of her photo shoot with Terry Richardson when she was 19-years-old . Fashion photographer Richardson, 48, used the New York piece published this week to vehemently deny all accusations of inappropriate conduct during his photo shoots, saying the pictures were taken as part of collaborations by those involved who were 'exploring sexuality.' Indeed, a source close to Richardson told Buzzfeed that despite the email they received from Cech, she instigated the sexual encounter and that the shoot was not her last with the photographer, nor was it the last time they took sexual pictures together. However, in her strongly worded rebuttal of the interview and Richardson's behavior, Cech, now a mother of two, recounts a very different story from the New York piece. Controversial: The cover piece for the latest edition of New York magazine has infuriated one of the models mentioned who claim to be one of Richardson's alleged victims . While Benjamin Wallace writes that she was unaware of Richardson's reputation for producing 'risqué' work, Cech claims that she 'completely taken off guard.' 'I was not warned that I would be expected to pose nude of engage in any sexual activity at the casting.' While Cech does not deny at any point that she did grab Richardson's penis and posed for pictures like this, she is adamant that she 'did not instigate the penis twisting, nudity or any kind of sexual touching.' While Wallace writes that Cech ultimately found the experience 'weird', the model instead writes she found it 'humiliating'. Cech admits that there is merit to the argument Wallace frames of Richardson as an artist or a predator. but her . email to Buzzfeed claims that 'what the article does not make clear is . that Richardson's sexual escapades go way beyond artistic 'boundary . pushing' and involve serious sexual harassment and abuse of young models . in the workplace.' Cech contends that she was 'abused' by Richardson and labels him a 'poor sick man.' In . one heartbreaking section of her email, Cech outlines the hurt caused . by the source close to Richardson who claimed she instigated the . touching. 'This is a flat-out lie. I remember going home after the casting and crying hysterically, unable to tell my boyfriend why I was upset and unwilling to share with him that I had been coerced into this bizarre sex act at work,' writes Cech. Fashion photographer Terry Richardson has denied claims of inappropriate conduct in a new interview . Wanting to set her story straight, Cech believes that Richardson 'clearly violated my rights.' Richardson has strongly denied previous accusations - mostly from models he has worked with - that he has acted inappropriately towards them. Allegations against Richardson have come from high profile celebrities and actresses, as well as younger, more anonymous models, but most have been incredibly damning of his conduct towards the women he works with. 'It was never just me and a girl, ever,' he said. 'It was always assistants, or other people around, or girls brought friends over to hang out. It was very daytime, no drugs, no alcohol. It was a happening, there was energy, it was fun, it was exciting, making these strong images, and that's what it was. People collaborating and exploring sexuality and taking pictures.' Recently in an e-mail to Jezebel, a New York-based writer and stylist named Anna claimed that she was 23 when the controversial photographer invited her to a photo shoot at his home, where he proceeded to ask her to reveal her 'tits' while he posed next to her. He then apparently asked her to crouch down on the floor, and 'suddenly, I felt a d*** pressing into the side of my face,' she reveals. 'He pressed it to my lips. He clearly wanted a blow job and wanted it documented on camera.' She described the horrifying moment when she realized Richardson, who was 43 at the time, was pressing himself against her while his assistant giggled and snapped photos. 'I didn't want to act scared or angry because I was in this guy's apartment with no one else around aside from his equally screwed-up assistant and who knows what these psychos were capable of,' she wrote. Location: A stylist and writer named Anna says she was at a launch party for Delicatessan (pictured) in New York City in 2008 when Richardson's assistant Leslie Lessin asked her to come to his apartment for a shoot . Anna said Richardson, who was 43 at the time, 'pressed his d*** against her face' while his assistant (pictured) giggled and snapped photos . Anna said she was hasn't revealed her story until now because she thought no one would care about a 'non-model' being sexually assaulted, especially without any solid proof. But she was finally prompted to open up after hearing recent reports that New York magazine is planning on doing a cover story absolving Richardson of the multiple sexual assault accusations he has faced over the years. 'The guy shouldn't just be locked out from the fashion photography world, he should be in jail,' she stated. 'Add another girl to the list!' Richardson, 48, has strongly denied previous accusations - mostly from models he has worked with - that he has acted inappropriately towards them. In a letter obtained by Page Six in March, he called the allegations 'lies' and said the claims were nothing more than an 'emotionally-charged witch-hunt'. Popular guy: Despite the numerous accusations against him, mostly from models he has snapped, Richardson continues to be one of the mot sought-after fashion photographers (left with Rihanna, and right with Kate Moss) 'People have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales,' he said. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors. Without my voice, all that remain are the lies.' Allegations against Richardson have come from high profile celebrities and actresses, as well younger, more anonymous models, but most have been incredibly damning of his conduct towards the women he works with. Supermodel Coco Rocha told Fashion magazine in July 2010: 'I've shot with [Richardson] but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.' And Danish model Rie Rasmussen said that the girls who work with Richardson 'are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.' Yet he continues to be one of the most sought-after photographers in the fashion industry, having done shoots with Charlize Theron, Mariah Carey, Rita Ora and Lindsay Lohan in the past three months alone.","Model Sena Cech has refuted the account of her encounter with Terry Richardson when she was 19 .

"By . James  Nye . Tragic: Closer magazine editor Annabel Vered's (pictured) daughter Tess Burstein, 6, was killed at a Father¿s Day barbecue in the Hamptons when she ran out into the road . The daughter of a top magazine editor died in harrowing circumstances at a Father's Day barbecue in the Hamptons after she was hit by a car in front of her parents. Tess Burstein, 6, whose mother is Closer magazine editor Annabel Vered, 43, was at a party for her investment banker father Josef Burstein when she ran in front of car in Water Mill trying to get to a friend. The young girl was struck by the Toyota Prius driven by her 76-year-old neighbor and witnesses described the horrific wailing of her parents as they tried to save her on Sunday. 'I was in my back yard, and I heard the parents screaming, ‘No! No! Oh, my god! Oh, my God!’’ neighbor, Susan Infantino, 66, told The New York Post. They were blood-curdling screams you . know could only come from a parent. … I yelled over, ‘What happened What . happened?’ And she said, ‘My daughter just got hit by a car!' Tess's uncle, Amit Burstein said that his brother, Joef, 46, was completely devastated. 'She . was an amazing girl, a very beautiful girl, very happy, very smart,’ Amit added of Tess. 'It’s a shock for everyone, a big, big loss.’ The family were hosting a barbecue at their summer getaway with other families when the accident happened. Tragic: Tessa Burstein was struck by a car after running out of her parents holiday home in Water Mill on Blank Lane . The driver of the Prius, Maurice Wittenberg was driving towards the front yard of the Water Mill property with another car driving towards them. Witnesses said this confused Tess, who didn't see the other car through her blind spot . 'I think she waited until the larger car passed, not seeing the car coming in the opposite direction, and it hit her,’ Infantino said to The New York Post. Treatment: Tessa was transported to Southampton Hospital and then to Stony Brook University Hospital where she was treated for critical injuries before her death just after 4pm . 'I swerved left, but I couldn’t really avoid her. My car hit her, and she went flying and ended up in the middle of the road,’ said Wittenberg, a retired chemist to The New York Post. 'I feel it wasn’t my fault, but it’s still a terrible thing to know you’ve killed an innocent little child. It was the worst day of my life.' His wife said that she wishes they had spent 10 more seconds in the supermarket - and this would never have happened. A nurse rushed to help little Tess, but she died in hospital hours later. Tess has a nine-year-old brother and a four-year-old sister who wanted to know if Wittenber was going to be given a ticket. That sad question aside, there is no suggestion that Wittenberg was driving negligently or outside the law.","Daughter of Closer magazine editor Annabel Vered, 43, tragically died on Sunday .

Nakita Jones' son Demetrius passed away last week in Indianapolis despite the best efforts of a passing police officer to keep the child alive with CPR. 'When I turned around I saw him fall and the TV fell on him and then it bounced off. You know, it all happened so fast,' she said. Crushed: Baby Demetrius (right, with his mother Nakita and older sister) was fatally injured by a falling television at home in Indianapolis last week . Jones told Wishtv that she fondly recalls her child's sweet demeanor. 'Oh man he was a happy baby. He was a sweet baby, sweet baby and he was a handsome son,' Jones remembered. In the immediate aftermath of the accident, Jones said that she rushed her child outisde to try and get help - and meet Detective David Miller. 'It meant so much, because no telling how long it would have taken the ambulance to get there. He was gone for that minute, but he gave him CPR and brought him back,' said Jones. Hurt: Nakita Jones said that she simply couldn't get to her son in time to stop him being crushed . 'David Miller, IMPD, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you,' said Darlene Jones, Demetrius’ grandmother. The family said Miller gave them extra time with their baby and that was very important. 'He held on, he held on as long as he could. He held on enough to be able to know that he was loved while he was in the hospital. To hear our voices, to feel us,' said his mother.

"By . James  Nye . Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is hoping the force is with him as he tries to squeeze his city into contention for Star War creator George Lucas' new museum that will be home to everything from Darth Vader's costume to the Millennium Falcon. Dueling Chicago and San Francisco have already drawn their metaphorical lightsaber's in hope of becoming home to the $300 million museum which will hold the life's collection of art and props the billionaire filmmaker has accrued. Using social media to boost his campaign, Garcetti, 43, has encouraged Angelenos to tweet their reasons why the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum should come to their city with the hashtag #WhyLucasInLA, including the obvious, 'The Force is strongest in Los Angeles!' In a city not so far away: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti poses up with his cute endorsement for the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum . On his website, the mayor posted a picture of himself holding a sign of a drawing of R2-D2, with the insignia 'LA' drawn across the iconic robot from Star Wars. 'This center presents such an amazing opportunity to inspire creativity, especially in our youth,' wrote Garcetti in an open letter to Lucas and his wife, Mellody Hobson, a Chicago native. 'We’d like you to consider opening your museum in a place where its impact can be amplified like no other, Los Angeles.' Boasting art work from greats such as Norman Rockwell and his own movies such as Indiana Jones and Star Wars, the proposed $300 million museum's new home will be decided by Lucas in the next few weeks. Endorsement: The mayor encouraged citizens of LA to tweet reasons why George Lucas should have his museum in the city . Logic: Others decided that with a burgeoning tourist industry, Los Angeles would be the perfect place for the museum . Marketing: One Twitter user decided that the logos used by the billionaire creator of Star Wars would be enticing . Decision makers: Mellody Hobson and husband George Lucas will ultimately decide where the museum will be . A spokesman for Lucas, who is paying for the museum himself through his own trust, said that the legendary filmmaker, who is a graduate of the University of Southern California and lives near San Francisco, would decide soon. 'Since the beginning of this process, we have indicated that several cities had expressed an interest in the possible location of the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum,' Perry said to Bloomberg News. 'We are grateful for everyone’s enthusiasm for this project.' Los Angeles wants Lucas to build the museum in Exposition Park, which is also home to the California Science Center and the Natural History Center. Museum pieces: Darth Vader Costume designed by Trisha Biggar for Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith and Yoda designed by Ralph McQuarrie are destined to take their places in George Lucas' new $300 million permanent museum . Beauty: The Palace of Theed on Naboo from 1999's The Phantom Menace designed by Scott Squires, Doug Chiang, Steve Gawley will take its place in the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum when it is built either in Los Angeles, Chicago or San Francisco . Iconic: A battle Droid full-size model and the costume for Queen Amidala's Senate Gown both seen in The Phantom Menace will also take their place in the eventual museum . Boys dream: Millennium Falcon scale model built for 1977's Star Wars A New Hope will also form part of the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum . However, they are facing stiff competition from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee for the museum which will house work by artists such as Norman Rockwell, prints from Disney movies and Lucas' own creations. Chicago has offered two parking lots near Soldier Field and McCormick Place. Alternatively, San Francisco has offered a seaside lot near the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The semi-retired Lucas described his proposed museum as 'a dedication to cultural fantasy' in an interview with CBS in March. Groundbreaking: A still from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines - whose special CGI effects were created by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic team . King: Visual effects for 1993's Jurassic Park were also pioneered by George Lucas's team at Industrial Light and Magic . Family favorites: George Lucas was also instrumental in the founding of DreamWorks studios and animation - which spawned Shrek and its sequels . Ahoy: The CGI effects that transformed Bill Nighy into Davy Jones for 2006's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest were created by Industrial Light and Magic . 'Part of the museum is designed to educate younger people into the idea of storytelling, into the idea of being able to paint your fantasies, which is what 'Star Wars' was,' he said. 'Star Wars' was there to inspire young people to imagine things, to imagine going anywhere in the universe and doing anything you want to do and using your imagination to entertain yourself.' Lucas bought his first work of art, a page from one of Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge comic books, for $25 when he was a University of Southern California film student. Since then, he has amassed a collection of 150 years of what he calls 'fantastical' art. Original: This print depicting Scrooge McDuck and his money bin was the first piece of film art purchased by George Lucas in 1972 . In a letter accompanying his proposal, Lucas described a childhood trip from his home in Modesto to the de Young Museum in San Francisco as life changing. 'I was drawn in by Norman Rockwell's ability to tell a complete story in a single image,' he wrote. 'It was then that I began to learn the art of visual storytelling.' Lucas has never made a film on a Hollywood lot, choosing instead to build his Lucasfilm empire in San Francisco. Last year he sold his eponymous special effects and film production unit - along with the rights to Star Wars and Indiana Jones - to Disney for $4 billion.","Star Wars creator George Lucas is to build $300 'storytelling museum' in either Chicago, San Francisco or Los Angeles .

"By . James  Nye . Dramatic photographs released on Sunday reveal the difficult moment the father of UC Santa Barbara campus shooter Elliot Rodger met the father of one his of shooting spree victims. Peter Rodger came face-to-face with Richard Martinez earlier this month, less than two weeks after his son, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, shot and stabbed six students including Martinez's 20-year-old son, Christopher. Courageous Martinez met Rodger at a Santa Barbara coffee shop on June 1. They wouldn't discuss details of what they called a 'private conversation between grieving fathers', but did say that they reached common ground. scroll down for video . Dramatic: Peter Rodger, left, with Richard Martinez. Photos released today show the dramatic meeting between the father of the UC Santa Barbara campus shooter and the father of one of the people who were killed during the shooting spree. 'We plan to work together so other families such as ours will not suffer as ours have,' Martinez told the station. Martinez has been an outspoken critic of the nation's gun laws since his 20-year-old son, Christopher Michaels-Martinez, was shot in the rampage that left five other UC San Barbara students dead. Police believe the killer took his own life after crashing his car as officers moved in. Elliot Rodger's parents issued a statement the morning after the killings that they were ""staunchly against guns"" and support gun-control laws. They said in another statement Thursday that it had been 'hell on earth' knowing their son's actions led to tragedy. 'We are crying out in pain for the victims and their families. It breaks our hearts on a level that we didn't think was possible,' Peter and Chin Rodger said in the statement. 'It is now our responsibility to do everything we can to help avoid this happening to any other family.' Difficult: The father of a college student who was gunned down in the May 23 mass killings near the University of California, Santa Barbara said he met privately with the father of his son's killer in early June . Richard Martinez, left, said he met Peter Rodger, the father of 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, at a Santa Barbara coffee shop. He wouldn't discuss details of what he called a ""private conversation between grieving fathers,"" but said they reached common ground . Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 on May 23 after years of what he claimed was rejection and ridicule and sexual jealousy because he was a virgin. He took his own life after his shooting rampage and it was claimed in the days afterwards that his family had tried to get him professional help weeks before the massacre. This comes as ABC announced that Barbara Walters will have the first interview with UC-Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger's father. Peter Rodger has not spoken out about his son's killing spree that left six dead and 13 others injured before killing himself. The special will mark the famed broadcaster's first return to television since she retired last month. ABC did not reveal when the interview will air, saying only that it will be an upcoming special edition of 20/20. The killer's mother, Li-Chin Rodger, was the first one to realize that something was awry at the time of his killing spree. Final warning: Elliot Rodger posted a confessional video titled 'Retribution' shortly before going on a killing spree near the UC-Santa Barbara campus in May . Promising: Christopher Martinez had planned to study in London for a year before starting law school . Victim: Christopher, 20, was one of six students to be killed in May's attack . Emotional: One day after his son was shot dead, Richard Martinez, center, blamed Christopher's death on 'irresponsible politicians and the NRA' Li-Chin, who have been divorced for many years, received an email from her 22-year-old son shortly after 9pm on May 25 which included a 140-page manifesto. She immediately went to Elliot's YouTube page and saw that he had uploaded a video called 'Retribution' wherein he describes how he plans to slaughter sorority girls. His mother knew something was horribly wrong and she called her ex, filmmaker Peter, and after they watched the video, they called 911. Both parents rushed to the scene separately and reportedly realized they were too late once they heard news reports of the ongoing rampage on the car radio. Neither parent has spoken out about the killings yet, and in the immediate aftermath they gave permission to a close friend to speak to the media on their behalf, explaining how Elliot had been receiving professional help for some time. '(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health,' Simon Astaire told CNN. 'They thought he was in good hands.' Change: Richard Martinez, who son Christopher was shot dead in May's attack, called for tougher gun laws . Richard Martinez has become a crusader for more stringent gun laws in the wake of his son's killing. In late May, Martinez addressed a crowd of about 20,000 who gathered for the University of California Santa Barbara memorial, the crowd got to their feet and joined his chant of 'Not One More'. Moments earlier he had given an emotional tribute to his only son, Christopher, who just before his death had been planning a year in London before starting law school. Instead, the 20-year-old became the sixth victim to die on May 23, during a deadly rampage by a college student in Isla Vista. Mr Martinez used the memorial on Tuesday to call for an end to gun violence, telling the crowd: 'Too many people have died, and there should be not one more,' NBC Los Angeles reported. 'How many more people are going to have to die in this situation before the problem gets solved?' he asked. 'They [politicians] have done nothing and that's why Chris died ... in my opinion,' Mr Martinez said. 'It's almost become a normal thing for us to accept [mass shootings] ... It's not normal. Life doesn't have to be like this.' After talking of his son's love of basketball, and describing him as kind and competitive, Mr Martinez addressed lawmakers who had reached out to him after Christopher's death. Composed: Richard Martinez also read statements from relatives of other victims, including the Hong family who called for 'Hatred to be gone with the wind' 'Don't tell me you are sorry about my son's death until you do something,' he said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. Mr Martinez told the crowd he should not be seen as a spokesman for all the families caught up in the stabbings and shootings. But he was asked by the families of Cheng Yuan Hong and Weihan 'David' Wang, to give statements on their behalf. As he held a Gone With The Wind book bag aloft, Mr Martinez read a statement from the Hong family, which said: 'May we together create a peaceful world and let hatred be gone with the wind.' The family of 20-year-old Wang have also called for tighter gun control. In their statement read by Mr Martinez, they said: 'Our child desired a land free from fear.' When Mr Martinez ended his speech, he called on the students gathered there to join him in his demand to end gun violence. As he returned to his seat, the grieving father was given a standing ovation, and the crowd continued the chant 'Not one more', which he had led them in just moments before. Mr Martinez had began his campaign just one day after his son's death, making an emotional televised appearance on Saturday. Clutching a photo of his son, he said: 'Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA. 'They talk about gun rights, but what about Chris' right to live? When will this insanity stop?'","Peter Rodger agreed to meet Richard Martinez earlier this month at a Santa Barbara coffee shop .

"By . James  Nye . The unsolved beheading of a retiree and the killing of his elderly wife has so rattled their gated, lakeside Georgia community that neighbors are casting about for even outlandish explanations. Was it a mob hit? A drug dealer? A hungry alligator? The peaceful neighborhood where the couple was found dead at the beginning of May hadn't seen as much as a burglary in recent memory. Then, in early May, concerned friends found the headless body of Russell Dermond, 88, in the garage of his home on Lake Oconee. Tragic find: Shirley Dermond's body was found in . a lake after searching for her since . May 7, when her husband Russell was found murdered in their $1 million . home . Shirley Dermond, 87, was originally thought to have been abducted until her body was found a few weeks later in the lake. Russell Dermond's head has still not been found. Even though law enforcement thinks the Dermonds likely knew the person or people who attacked them, their advanced age, the beheading after he was killed, and the fact that it all happened in a seemingly secure community that has a manned guardhouse has left neighbors rattled, according to Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills. 'It is the prime topic of conversation around,' said Ron Bridgeman, senior editor of The Eatonton Messenger, a weekly newspaper. 'It has consumed hours and hours and hours of our time.' Despite interviewing hundreds of people and looking through reams of records, Sills has been frustrated by the lack of obvious motive and is hoping for a breakthrough. And for the first time in his 18 years as sheriff and four decades in law enforcement, he's asked the public to donate to a reward fund. He believes someone knows something and while they may not feel compelled by a sense of what's right and wrong, he said: 'I've found that almost all of them will respond to enough money, and we intend to offer enough money out there to spark that mercenary side of somebody.' Sills says he can't even remember so much as a burglary in the Dermonds' community during his tenure as sheriff. The surrounding county sees occasional domestic violence or drug-related killings but the last time there was a 'whodunit' murder, where they didn't immediately know who the killer was, was about five years ago, when a body was found beaten beyond recognition with no identification, Sills said. But they made arrests in that case within a week. Gruesome: Russell Dermond's decapitated body was found at the couple's exclusive lake-front home on May 7 . Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman . In quiet downtown Eatonton, about a dozen miles from the gated community of Great Waters where the Dermonds lived, antique shops, clothing boutiques and restaurants fill historic store fronts that have plaques outside saying what the building was originally — cotton warehouse, bank, grocery, barber shop. And people there are talking about the mystery, said Karen Bridgeman, Ron Bridgeman's wife and the newspaper's managing editor. 'There are as many different theories as there are people in the county.' Some of the most common are that the Dermonds, originally from New Jersey, had organized crime ties and were victims of a mob hit or that their deaths are related to the killing of their oldest son in 2000 in a drug deal gone bad. The craziest tip authorities got was that it was likely a female alligator seeking food for her young, the sheriff said. Sills is tired of all the theories and speculation. He has investigated the Dermonds' lives in depth and has determined that they worked hard, paid their taxes, went to church. There's no indication of any illegal activity or association with unsavory characters, he said. There's no indication that anything was taken from the home. He simply can't figure out who would want the Dermonds dead. Russell Dermond had a corporate job and moved around until finally ending up in the Atlanta area. After he retired, he got into the fast food business, buying a number of chain restaurants. When he retired for a second time, he and his wife moved south to Lake Oconee. He played golf regularly until a few years ago and still liked to take walks, the sheriff said. Shirley Dermond was an avid bridge player, rarely missing the twice-weekly meetings of her club. Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party . They lived a remarkably simple life, Sills said. Russell Dermond only had two credit cards and put everything on those to rack up rewards points. He didn't even have an ATM card as he never carried cash, the sheriff said. They were regulars at the Lake Oconee Community Church, missing services only when they went to visit their children in other states, Pastor David Key said. They were social and clearly had money but didn't flaunt it, he said. 'They were just a nice, unassuming couple,' Key said. The Dermonds had three sons and a daughter. Their oldest son had a serious drug problem and was shot to death while trying to buy drugs in a rough neighborhood in Atlanta in 2000, Sills said. The Dermonds' oldest living son, Keith, did not return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment. The other two children could not be reached. But Sills said he's questioned all three at length and talks to at least one of them almost every day. They've been extremely cooperative, answering his inquiries quickly and getting him any information he needs, Sills said. Sills believes the Dermonds likely were at least acquainted with the person or people who killed them because there was no sign of forced entry and no sign of a struggle. While he's not positive the killer or killers arrived and left by boat to reach the secluded cove where the couple's home sits, he's certain a boat was used to dispose of Shirley Dermond's body, which was found in the lake about five and a half miles from their home. As he puts the pieces together slowly and hopes for some sort of a break, Sills said he remains undaunted. 'They've done a good job concealing themselves,' he said of the killers. 'We've got to do a better job of finding them.'","Russell Dermond's decapitated body was discovered in his garage on May 7 .

"By . Associated Press . Citing an anthrax scare and a recurring problem with safety, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday shut down two research labs and stopped shipping highly dangerous germs to other labs. One of the closed facilities was involved an incident last month that could have accidentally exposed workers in three labs to anthrax. A second, previously undisclosed problem earlier this year involved deadly bird flu. The two lab safety problems were discussed Friday by CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden. He also released a report that detailed three other incidents in the past decade in which mistakes or other problems caused potentially dangerous germs to be sent out. Government health officials are cracking down on safety at the nation¿s highest-level biosecurity labs after a disturbing series of lapses, including an anthrax scare, discovery of lost vials containing live smallpox ¿ and a new report of the accidental shipment of highly pathogenic bird flu . No lab worker or member of the public was sickened in any of the incidents, the CDC said. But Frieden acknowledged the CDC is entrusted to operate some of the world's most advanced and most secure laboratories for the handling of deadly germs. 'I'm just astonished that this could have happened here,' Frieden said. The disclosure comes days after the government revealed the discovery of six forgotten vials of smallpox virus in a laboratory building at the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. On Friday, Frieden announced that tests show that two of the 60-year-old vials had live virus. More testing is going on, but all the samples are to be destroyed. No infections have been reported in that incident, either. The CDC moratorium on shipment of highly dangerous germs will affect the federal agency's labs at its Atlanta headquarters and Fort Collins, Colorado. The two Atlanta labs where the recent incidents occurred have been temporarily closed. The Centers for Disease Control sign is seen at its main facility in Atlanta, Georgia. aA immediate moratorium on all shipments of biological materials from CDC biosecurity level 3 and level 4 labs until problems are addressed . Frieden also announced that internal and external review panels will investigate both recent problems and review procedures. A CDC report on the anthrax incident found several errors and bad decisions. The report said anthrax should not have been used in that lab experiment and the samples used weren't sterilized as expected. In the flu incident, the CDC said a sample of an animal flu virus was accidentally contaminated with a deadly bird flu germ. That sample was then sent to another government lab, which discovered the contamination. The problem was discovered in May, but wasn't reported to CDC's top management until this week, Frieden said.","Major safety crackdown at nation’s highest-level biosecurity labs in Atlanta .

Appearing on the sports network on Wednesday for their World Cup Preview, former star Donovan lambasted defeatist coach Klinsmann for repeating for the second time in as many weeks that the USA has no chance at all of winning the trophy. 'This will come as a surprise to nobody, but I don't agree with Jurgen,' said Donovan who will work for ESPN for the duration of the 32-nation tournament which kicks-off on Thursday in Brazil. Scroll Down for Video . Straight talking: Landon Donovan has said that Jurgen Klinsmann is talking nonsense and the United States has every chance of winning the World Cup in Brazil . 'And as someone who has been in that locker room and has sat next to the players, we agree with the supporter group American Outlaws: We believe that we will win. 'I think that’s the way Americans think and I think that’s the sentiment.' Klinsmann was blasted by American soccer fans when he claimed in a New York Times article that his team were simply turning up at the World Cup hoping for the best. 'We cannot win the World Cup because we are not at that level yet,' Klinsmann said. 'For us, we have to play the game of our lives seven times to win the tournament.' Indeed, for effect, Klinsmann repeated this claim on Wednesday at his first news conference after arriving in Brazil. 'If it’s now American or not American, I don’t know. You can correct me however you want,' the U.S. coach . Pundit: Landon Donovan pulled no punches in his first appearance on ESPN as a soccer pundit for the World Cup . Klinsmann won the 1990 World Cup as a player for West Germany and coached Germany to the 2006 semifinals. However, Donovan was not just being a blind patriot in his attack on Klinsmann. He made a compelling case for the questionable psychology behind Klinsmann's supposed realism. 'If we're really expecting to go out and beat Ghana, beat Portugal and beat Germany -- in my opinion Germany is one of the best teams in the world. If you can beat Germany, why can't you beat anybody else? 'It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but I believe the US can win the World Cup and I think all of America believes it. We can do it.' ESPN are no doubt excited by the prospect of more potential headline making contradictions from Donovan, the all-time leading scorer for the United States with 57 goals and 156 caps. 'Adding Landon to our ESPN roster just before the World Cup is a coup because he knows the United States team better than anyone having played such a huge role in its success, especially at this event,' said Jed Drake, ESPN's executive producer for World Cup coverage. 'Landon is also one of this country's biggest sports stars, and we believe that he will help attract even more fans to our monthlong coverage.' Difference of opinion: Head coach Jurgen Klinsmann of the United States walks the pitch during the US Men's National Team training session at Sao Paulo FC on June 11, 2014 in Sao Paulo, Brazil . Donovan won’t be traveling to Brazil, instead broadcasting from ESPN’s studios in Los Angeles. Last month, Donovan thought he had earned a prominent role on the U.S. World Cup team right up until the moment he was cut from the roster by coach Jurgen Klinsmann. Donovan was still stunned and confused by Klinsmann’s decision when he went back to work with the LA Galaxy on Saturday. 'I’m disappointed. I’m sad,' Donovan said after being left out. 'I’m human, and I wanted to go. I really wanted to go. I’m at peace with it. I respect the decision. I just feel in my heart that I deserve to be there, and that’s the pill that’s hardest to swallow.' The 32-year-old attacker was denied the chance to play in his fourth World Cup after Klinsmann chose US team newcomer Aron Johannsson and 31-year-old Chris Wondolowski over the most accomplished international player in American history. The decision surprised Donovan, who believed a strong performance in training camp had secured his spot on the 23-man roster. Legend: Landon Donovan of Los Angeles Galaxy reacts to his supporters after a 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Union at StubHub Center on May 25, 2014 in Los Angeles, California . But Donovan declined to speculate on additional possible factors in the decision: his recent soccer sabbatical, the coach’s decision to evaluate a versatile player solely as a forward, or the impact of the Americans’ difficult group draw on their long-term planning. 'I think if I’m being judged solely on what happens in camp, then I absolutely deserved to be going to Brazil,' Donovan said. 'I firmly believe that not only should I be going, but I feel like I really deserved it, and not from anything that I did in the past, but from what I’ve done in the last week and a half.' Donovan gave little insight into whatever reasons Klinsmann shared with him at the Bay Area training camp. Klinsmann provided only murky details about his decision Friday, saying other players were 'a little step ahead of Landon in certain areas.' 'I don’t agree with that assessment,' Donovan said. 'I think I was at least as good as everybody else in camp. ... I think I was one of the better players, so that’s why it stings a little. If I had gone in and didn’t feel like I deserved it, I could live with that. But that’s not the case here.' Donovan had nothing to say about any underlying implications of the mocking tweet by Jonathan Klinsmann, the coach’s teenage son, moments after the announcement. 'I don’t really know his son well, so I’m not really sure where that came from,' Donovan said. Landon Donovan is the leading scorer for the US Men's National Team with 57 goals and is seen here representing LA Galaxy . Donovan also doesn’t think his four-month sabbatical from soccer in 2013 after the Galaxy’s second straight MLS Cup title should have worked against him. 'I actually think I’ve been a much better player since I came back,' he said. Donovan is the career U.S. leader with 57 international goals, and is second with 156 appearances. He has scored five World Cup goals, including a stoppage-time goal against Algeria to send the Americans to the second round four years ago. Instead of jetting off to Brazil, the five-time MLS Cup champion will resume his pursuit of the top U.S. league’s career goal-scoring record in Sunday’s home game against Philadelphia. Donovan tied Jeff Cunningham’s mark with his 134th goal late last season, but hasn’t scored in seven matches with the Galaxy this year. 'I’m excited to be back here,' Donovan said. 'I certainly didn’t want to be back here under these circumstances or this soon, but I love these guys. These are my teammates, and this is my home. I will not let this affect me going forward.' Donovan said he would gladly return to the U.S. team from the standby list if an injury created a spot on the roster, and he wouldn’t rule out playing for the U.S. team in the future. He urged fans to support Klinsmann’s current squad because “I don’t want there to be a negative tint to any of this.” 'I’ve always loved representing this country, so I can’t imagine that if I’m given another opportunity that I would say no,' Donovan added. 'But at this point, I’m just trying to deal with the disappointment.' 72168 . 92091 . 238237 .","Landon Donovan used his first appearance as a pundit on ESPN to criticize US Soccer coach Jurgen Klinsmann .

"By . Daniel Bates . Samsung has been ordered to pay a $340,000 fine by a regulator in Taiwan for paying people to write negative online reviews about a competitor’s mobile phones. The tech giant was found to have hired people to attack HTC  whilst praising its own products in a cut-throat attempt to corner the market. The ‘reviewers’ did not reveal who they actually were, meaning that the public were being fooled into thinking that they were reading honest appraisements. The fake reviews related to an advert about the camera functions on Samsung's Galaxy Y Duos GT-S6102, one of its flagship products . The fine marks a new low in the bitter battle for the mobile phone market that is being fought by Samsung, Apple, Google and HTC. Sun Lih-chyun, a spokesman for the Taiwan Federal Trade Commission, branded Samsung ‘deceitful’ for what it did. He said: ‘This is the first case of its kind in Taiwan that a company has concealed its genuine status while attacking a rival. ‘The behaviour has negative impacts on market order and violated the fair trade law.’ The fake reviews related to an advert about the camera functions on Samsung’s Galaxy Y Duos GT-S6102, one of its flagship products. The Taiwan FTC said its activities were designed to ‘highlight the shortcomings of competing products’ and that it was responsible for the ‘disinfection of negative news about Samsung products’. HTC was described as ‘the victim of a campaign of defamation’. Posting fake reviews online is known in the mobile industry as ‘astroturfing’.

In addition to Samsung, two marketing firms in Taiwan were fined a combined total of $100,000. According to research firm IDC, last year Samsung held a 30.3 percent share of the global smartphone market whilst Apple had 19.1 percent and HTC had 4.6 percent. Samsung has run into a series of legal troubles, not least with Apple which won a $1bn patent dispute with it in a California court when a judge ruled it had ripped off its designs. Both sides have used ripe language to accuse the other of theft with Apple alleging that Samsung ‘flagrantly copied’ its products. British, Dutch and German courts have disagreed with the verdict and ruled that Samsung products are sufficiently different from those made by Apple. For its part Samsung has alleged that Apple has stolen data management and mobile communication technology from its designs. Samsung said: ‘We are disappointed that the Taiwan FTC has decided that we have violated the Fair Trade Act based on online marketing activities. ‘Samsung Electronics Taiwan is carefully reviewing the decision and will take all necessary steps to protect our reputation as a company which values its customers.’","Found to have hired people .

"By . Daniel Bates . The man who accused Michael Jackson in court of abusing him has got married, with the prosecutor who accused the King of Pop among the guests. Gavin Arvizo, whose claims led to the sensational trial in 2005, wed his sweetheart Shelby Drake who is the daughter of an Atlanta Baptist minister and spent her youth growing up in England. The guest list included some unusual additions, like the former Santa Barbara Senior Assistant District Attorney Ron Zonen, who prosecuted the Jackson case. Michael Jackson pictured with 12 year-old Gavin Arvizo in Neverland, California. Mr Arvizo, whose claims led to the sensational trial in 2005, wed his sweetheart Shelby Drake who is the daughter of an Atlanta Baptist minister and spent her youth growing up in England . But at the reception afterwards there was an awkward moment when DJ unwittingly played Jackson’s hit ‘The Way You Make Me Feel’ - causing Arvizo to shrug his shoulders in resignation. Details of Arvizo’s life today were made public in an article in the Daily Beast which revealed he is now living a modest life working as a paralegal and wants to go to Harvard. Arvizo, now 24, was a 13-year-old cancer survivor when he claimed Jackson had abused him at his Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos, California. Arvizo, now 24, was a 13-year-old cancer survivor when he claimed Jackson had abused him at his Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos, California . According to the article Arvizo only talks about his past when he applies for jobs and over the years has turned down lucrative offers to speak out . The allegations led to the trial that derailed Jackson’s career, even though he was acquitted on all 10 counts. Arvizo’s wedding took place at the bride’s suburban Atlanta Baptist Church on Saturday November 30 but have only now come to light. Senior Deputy District Attorney Ron Zonen, who prosecuted the Jackson case, was guest . Her father Bill Drake, an ordained minister, and a Catholic priest, Kevin Hargaden, performed the service and Arvizo plans to worship in both churches. Drake spent time in England when his daughter was young, meaning she spent part of her childhood in the UK. Among the guests was US comedienne Louise Palanker, a mentor to the Arvizo family who was called as a prosecution witness in the trial, and Arvizo’s mother Janet, who ironically, has married a man called Jay Jackson - meaning her name now is Janet Jackson. Also present was Gavin’s older sister Davellin and her brother Star, who both testified against Jackson. According to the article Arvizo only talks about his past when he applies for jobs and over the years has turned down lucrative offers to speak out. The article says: ‘He says he knows the truth and believes it will be revealed to the doubters of the world when the time is right.’ Jackson died in 2009, aged 50, whilst preparing for the This Is It comeback concerts at the O2 arena in London.","Arvizo, whose claims led to trial in 2005, wed sweetheart Shelby Drake .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . From huge herds of zebras to colossal colonies of penguins, safety it seems, really does comes in numbers. And these creatures have no qualms when it comes to the issue of personal space with often millions travelling together across difficult terrain. Such mass migrations create some of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles revealing the stunning patterns and behaviours of the natural world. Scroll down for video . This breath-taking set of photographs show that some animals take no chances when it comes to safety in numbers. Pictured is a mass colony of king penguins seen in South Georgia . Often creatures huddle together as a way of keeping themselves safe from predators while they trek thousands of miles in their pursuit for food and shelter. Amazingly, this type of behaviour isn't specific to a few types of animals and can be seen across the entire wildlife spectrum, including birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects and crustaceans. But the reason for these epic congregations can vary, with some animals following weather patterns to sustain their supply of food and water while others migrate to return to familiar breeding grounds. A spectacular mass migration sight is that of flamingos in East Africa flying in massive V formations when heading for their preferred breeding area in Tanzania. Huge quantities of female red crabs are pictured after spawning on Christmas Island. Larger males arrive at the sea about 5-7 days before they female, but are soon outnumbered . Blue and yellow snapper fish are seen in moving vast schools along the reef, Fiji. These creatures have no qualms when it comes to the issue of personal space . One of the most impressive mass migrations is that of the zebra. Earlier this year, a population of zebras surprised scientists by making a more than 300 mile (482km) journey across Namibia and Botswana . Often seen during mass migration, these enormous animal groupings can be found in countries all over the world and prove an effective method of keeping themselves safe from predators. Pictured is a huge group of great Indian horseshoe bats nesting in India . The longest insect migration is the monarch butterfly. It travels up to 4,750km. The rarest migrant is the Amsterdam albatross. There are only 70-80 adults in the world. The longest recorded journey in water is a leatherback turtle, which travelled 20,558km in 647 days. Source: Natural History Museum . As many as 2.5 million pink-feathered birds take to the skies for the journey as their breeding season arrives. Humpback whales, for instance, travel further than any other mammal migrants, making a journey of up to 5,300 miles (8,500km) each way. They are found in all of the world's oceans, with most populations following a regular migration route from polar waters for feeding and tropical waters for mating. The most dramatic migrations are often seen in the Serengeti, an area located in north Tanzania and extending to south-western Kenya. Around 750,000 zebras and 1.2 million wildebeests travel from the Ngorongoro area in southern Tanzania to the Masai Mara in lower Kenya following weather patterns.

This is the longest big-mammal migration ever documented in Africa and is a rare bright spot at a time when mass movements of wildlife are disappearing because of fencing, land occupation and other human pressures. 'It goes to show us that nature still has some surprises,' said Robin Naidoo, senior conservation scientist at the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund that led the two-year study on the migration.

"By . Jennifer Newton . The last photographs of remote hill tribes in Thailand barely touched by modern society have been revealed after more than 30 years. The rare images captured in the 1970s and 80s show children smoking tobacco, neck stretching jewellery and opium picking in the fields in a remote land completely separated from the modern world. John Spies lived in isolated locations in northern Thailand with the remote tribes, which no longer exists due to their people moving on into more urban areas. John Spies captured these rare images over 30 years ago, of remote hill tribes in northern Thailand. Here some children smoke tobacco, which was common among the tribes . Mr Spies said that children smoking tobacco was quite common as the tribes, who were almost cut off from the outside world, weren't aware of the damaging health effects . The people of the tribes were entirely self-sufficient, and farmed the land by growing rice and keeping animals such as pigs . Children fire guns to celebrate their traditional New Year, left, while another young child smokes tobacco, right . The children of the tribes play with muzzle-loading rifles in the rare images taken by photographer John Spies . But during the time in the 1970s and 80s he spent with the tribe, he got a unique insight into their lives. The photographer, who is originally from Australia, has lived near Chiang Mai in Thailand for 37 years. He even learned to speak the northern Thai dialect, the common language the hill tribes used to communicate with each other. He . explained: 'There were around seven major ethnic groups spread across . the hills of northern Thailand in the 1970s and 1980s with a few smaller . groups in border areas. Two girls from the Pwo Karen tribe are pictured in the traditional dress of their people . A male tribe member covered in tattoos, left, which they believe protects them from physical and spiritual harm, while right, a farmer with his chickens in a basket . These girls pose in the traditional hand woven tribal costume of the Lawa girls, who wear the outfits everyday . Many of the tribal people had travelling dentists fit gold caps over their front teeth as a show of wealth and a sign of beauty . A woman makes her way through the fields, where the tribes would farm opium during the 1970s and 80s . 'I visited villages of all of the major groups - together they are commonly called hill tribes, but in reality they are not really a tribe. 'More accurately they are distinct ethnic groups with their own culture, language and traditions. 'There were no schools and the people were living in remote villages - they had no idea about the outside world. Neck rings, left, which are worn by the female members of the Padaung tribe as they are considered a symbol of beauty. Meanwhile, right, one of the youngest tribe members is dressed in traditional costume . An elderly lady with her family, who suffers from a swollen neck. Symptoms such as these were common in tribes people, due to a lack of iodine in their diet . The tribes also farm opium and pick it in the fields surrounding the villages, left, as well as growing and producing their own rice, right . Young members of the tribe weren't discouraged from smoking tobacco as they had no idea that it would be harmful . 'They had seen airplanes fly overhead and some asked me if I came from the moon.' While spending time with the tribes, Mr Spies even learned to speak the northern Thai dialect, the common language used by the people to communicate with each other. He also witnessed many of the traditions of the tribes which include young children smoking home-grown tobacco and how they played with muzzle-loading rifles. Children from the tribes climb to the top of a look-out to survey their land in the northern regions of Thailand . The villagers in this tribe load up their horses to transport goods through the remote hills and valleys . An overview of one of the villages in the hills pictured more than 30 years ago, before it had been touched by modern society . Mr Spies added: 'Most children either smoked their rough home-grown tobacco or chewed betel leaf which they mixed with tobacco, lime and chestnut tree bark, which would blacken their teeth. 'They had no idea that tobacco was harmful. 'Even babies breastfeeding - some would feed for up to five years - would grab their parent's cheroot and take a puff. 'They were self-reliant and grew subsistence rice on slopes that they had cleared of forest cover.'","Pictures show the remote tribes who lived separately from the modern world in the hills of northern Thailand .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Astronauts go to the ends of the Earth to prepare for the isolation and dangers of space. And for one group of Esa astronauts, that means spending days navigating dark, damp caves in Italy. Esa trainers and caving specialists recently went underground in Sardinia to set the scene for space-like astronaut training later this summer, and claim clambering down to a cave is similar to a spacewalk. Scroll down for video . Caves - short for Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behaviour and performance Skills - offers astronauts, trainers and planners a chance to test space-like procedures while exploring uncharted caverns in new environments . ‘Caves’ - short for Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behaviour and performance Skills - helps astronauts test space-like procedures while exploring uncharted caverns. For instance, clambering down to basecamp hundreds of metres below the surface using safety tethers is similar to conducting a spacewalk. In space, an object can quickly float away and be lost forever. Likewise, in caving, dropped equipment can be lost forever in crevices or holes. When passing equipment, both cavers and astronauts must make sure the recipient has grasped the item before the first person lets go. 'Caves is an exploration mission,' explained Caves exploration instructor Francesco Sauro, 'and this year will be more difficult as the astronauts venture further from basecamp' 'Caves is an exploration mission,' explained Caves exploration instructor Francesco Sauro, 'and this year will be more difficult as the astronauts venture further from basecamp.' For the first time the trainees will set up an outpost more than 3.1 miles (5 km) from basecamp to spend the night, following directions and maps drawn by ‘cavenauts’ from previous years. 'It will be interesting to see how they manage the further exploration,' said Mr Francesco. 'As they distance themselves from basecamp it will get more challenging and I am curious to see how far they can go.' For the first time, trainees will set up an outpost more than 3.1 miles (5 km) from basecamp to spend the night, following directions and maps drawn by ‘cavenauts’ from previous years . On the left Esa's Caves team prepares the 2014 underground astronaut training course. Astronauts (right) will use Earth-training programmes such as this to prepare for space . As for any space mission, science is a priority so the astronauts will be measuring carbon dioxide and radon levels as well as taking microbiological samples of the life they encounter. New techniques will be put to the test using apps developed by the trainers at the European Astronaut Centre that could be used on the International Space Station in the near future. The cavenauts will be testing exciting new technology for cavers as well. A system combining 3D cameras, laser mapping and a wearable computer offers the potential to map uncharted areas in real time and build a detailed 3D map for later use. 'What we are doing will be very interesting and useful for cavers all over the world,' added Mr Francesco. If six months in orbit 230 miles from earth sounds like a challenge, take a look at the bizarre lengths astronaut Tim Peake has already gone to in his training. The countdown to blast-off has included a week in an underground cave and 12 days on the bottom of the sea. Major Peake, Britain’s first astronaut for 20 years, took stomach-churning ‘zero gravity’ flights and learned Russian to communicate on the International Space Station. And if that wasn’t enough, he yesterday said last year he may take didgeridoo lessons. The former test pilot from Chichester, West Sussex, has no fears about launching into space from Kazakhstan in a Russian Soyuz rocket in November 2015 – because it’s much less dangerous than his old job . He said: ‘I think my future career is probably far safer than my past career. I’ve carried out some fairly high-risk flight tests. I’m not overly apprehensive.’ But the 41-year-old said the thrill was mixed with ‘concern’ over leaving his wife, Rebecca, and their two sons for so long.

Descendants of the Comanche Indians who took part in the D-Day landings gathered on Utah beach in France to commemorate the 70th anniversary of D-Day . A total of 13 Comanche Indians landed on Utah beach on June 6, 1944 with the 4th US Infantry Division in their role as code talkers and all survived . During the Second World War, the United States military used Native American speakers to develop a code based on their then-unwritten language. The code would then be used to transmit secret messages that could not be understood by German occupiers. It would take a military machine up to four hours to transmit and decode a message but the code talkers were able to do it in just minutes. During the D-Day landings, Comanche soldiers were among the Allied troops who hit the beaches of Normandy, but when they landed they were five miles off their designated target. A Comanche Indian in full dress begins the ceremony, which commemorated their descendant's actions on D-Day in north west France .

"By . Daniel Bates . Selfies are fuelling a rise in plastic surgery because people are putting their faces under a ‘microscope’ every time they take a picture on their smart phones. The trend of taking your own portrait means that we are becoming increasingly narcissistic and want to go under the knife to improve our looks, said US surgeons. The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery revealed that one third of its 2,700 members reported an increase in procedures last year due to pictures taken on social media. The selfie taken at the Oscars earlier this month by actor Bradley Cooper featuring celebrities including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey became the most re-tweeted photo of all time . As a result the organisation’s members saw a 10 per cent rise in nose jobs and a seven per cent increase in hair transplants. There was also a six per cent increase in eyelid surgery. Dr Edward Farrior, President of the AAFPRS, said that if you wanted to avoid feeling bad about yourself, it might be time to put your phone down. He said: ‘Social platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and the iPhone app Selfie.im, which are solely image based, force patients to hold a microscope up to their own image and often look at it with a more self-critical eye than ever before. Many surgeons report an increase in procedures as social media causes us to over analyse our flaws . ‘These images are often the first impressions young people put out there to prospective friends, romantic interests and employers and our patients want to put their best face forward.’ Dr Farrior said that the most popular selfie-inspired operations for women were face lifts, nose jobs and Botox. Men went for Botox and hair transplants, he added. The trend was particularly strong among you people and in a worrying twist, last year 58 per cent of plastic surgeons saw a rise in cosmetic surgery among the under-30s. Selfies hugely popular in the UK and are so ingrained in our culture that the word has been incorporated into the Oxford English Dictionary. Britons now take 35m selfies a month and more than half of adults have taken one, including 29 per cent of the over 65s. A selfie taken at the Oscars earlier this month by actor Bradley Cooper featuring celebrities including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey became the most forwarded message of all time on Twitter. It was forwarded on more than two million times, causing the social media site to briefly crash.

"By . Joel Christie . Media mogul Tyler Perry has defeated a fledgling reality television star to win the trademark for the title 'What Would Jesus Do?' The result ends a long and bitter court battle between the actor-director and Kim 'Poprah' Kearney, a reality TV star best known for an appearance of I Want To Work For Diddy on VH1. Kearney had filed for the trademark of What Would Jesus Do in January 2008 order to make a Christian reality series. Then in May of that year Tyler Perry Studios filed to secure the same trademark in order to use it for films, musicals and television series, according to The Guardian. Winner: Tyler Perry, 44, has officially won the trademark to use 'What Would Jesus Do?' as a film, musical and/or TV series . The actor-director beat out reality TV star Kim Kearney, who filed for the trademark in 2008 in order to make a television series . It is not know exactly what Perry intends to do with the title. However Kearney claims she discussed the Christian reality show with Perry before either of them filed for the trademark. The studio’s legal team argued that Kearney had no intention of using What Would Jesus Do as she initially claimed in her trademark application. Perry's people had to prove a burden of proof in order to cancel Kearney's trademark application. They argued Kearney failed to produce a television show with the title and that her website for the show did not actually function. Cancellation of the trademark is now pending after the trademark office granted its cancellation on non-use grounds on June 20. Perry’s trademark says that no claim in its trademark is made to use 'Jesus' exclusively. The phrase was popularised in the United States in the 1990s, appearing on bracelets and T-shirts. Kearney took to Twitter to thank people for their support. 'Thanks every1 who has reached out bout the board letting @tylerperry steal my trademark 4 What Would Jesus Do-but its not over-God got this!' she posted on Thursday.","Finalizes trademark case that started in 2008 .

"By . Daniel Bates . Brett Favre has revealed that he has forgotten memories of his daughter growing up because of the damage caused to his brain by big hits while playing football. The NFL legend said he found it ‘pretty shocking’ that he cannot remember his grown-up daughter playing youth soccer one summer. He said he fears he has been damaged by his time in the game and that for the first time in his life it ‘put a little fear in me'. Out of action: Vikings quarterback Brett Favre, who is suffering memory loss, says he will not return to the game . Favre said: ‘I think after 20 years [in the NFL], God only knows the toll’. To have such an icon of the game talk about the damage it has caused him will put the NFL under new pressure to do something about brain-related injuries. Favre started 321 consecutive games and threw 552 touchdown passes in his career, during which he was known for his toughness and playing through injuries. Now aged 44, the former Green Bay Packers quarterback, who also played for the Vikings, was forced to retire last season after sustaining a knee injury. Since then he has enjoyed spending time with wife Deanna, their daughters, Brittany, 24, and Breleigh, 14, and his three-year-old grandson. Speaking to ESPN’s Sports Talk 570, Favre said that he had no desire to return to the game - but his memory was becoming a pressing issue. He said: ‘I don't remember my daughter playing soccer, playing youth soccer, one summer. Memory loss: Favre with his daughter Breleigh. The quaterback says he struggles to remember parts of eldest daughter Brittany's childhood . Pain barrier: Favre is tackled by New England Patriots player Myron Pryor in 2010 . ‘I don't remember that. I got a pretty good memory, and I have a tendency like we all do to say, ""Where are my glasses?"" and they're on your head. ‘This was pretty shocking to me that I couldn't remember my daughter playing youth soccer, just one summer, I think. ‘I remember her playing basketball, I remember her playing volleyball, so I kind of think maybe she only played a game or two. I think she played eight. So that's a little bit scary to me. ‘For the first time in 44 years, that put a little fear in me.’ The NFL is under mounting pressure to do something about brain injuries to veterans of the game and hardly a week goes by without a former star speaking out. Benjamin Utect, a former tight end with the Indianapolis Colts, has spoken about how he fears his life and mind are about the fall apart at the age of just 30. The father-of-three has been suffering disturbing episodes of memory loss which he fears are brought on by the heavy hits he sustained during his career. Among the others affected was legendary tight end John Mackey, who died at the age of 69 after struggling with dementia. By the end of his life the hugely popular former Baltimore Colts player could barely speak and did not recognise the jacket he was given when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Green Bay Packers defensive tackle Ryan Pickett, who played with Favre and is still in the game, said: ‘I didn't know what to think about that. Rough: The Vikings quarterback has fears about memory loss after his successful football career . ‘I mean he's been out of football for a couple of years, so I was shocked. That's crazy’. Football and hockey players who suffer bangs to the head during their careers have chronic traumatic encephalopath (CTE) diagnosed long before they should do. The condition causes early onset dementia and was first noticed in boxers in the 1920s who suffered memory loss and problems with concentration. More than 20 dead NFL players had CTE diagnosed in recent years, with a string of cases causing widespread alarm. A study commissioned by the NFL In 2009 found that if the sample of people they tested was multiplied out across the 4,000 NFL retirees aged 50 and above, 244 of them would have cognitive disease. The normal rate is 48. Among men aged 30 to 49 the NFL rate would be 57, but the normal rate should be just three.","Green Bay Packers quarterback forced to retire at 44 .

"By . Daniel Bates . Two best friends in their 40s, who look young and healthy, want to take their own lives after hearing a talk from a controversial euthanasia physician - even though their own doctors are against it. Pegie Liekens, 44, and Nancy Vermeulen, 43, from Belgium, have said that they cannot go on with their non-life threatening diseases so are turning to assisted suicide. Liekens, a mother of one, . suffered serious complications from anti-obesity surgery and can now . only consume liquids and soft foods. Nancy Vermeulen, right, and Pegie Liekens, are two friends who want euthanasia, pose in Zemst, Belgium . She has to have regular blood transfusions because she has anaemia and also has an agonising herniated disc in her back. In . 2011 Miss Vermeulen was diagnosed with MS which leaves her exhausted . for months on end. She wants to end her life before it gets much worse. When both women spoke to their own doctors about assisted suicide, they were told not to do it. Miss Liekens was told to wait a few . years and to see what happened with her condition, and not to give up . hope on medical advances in their lifetime. Miss Vermeulen told the National Post that her doctor said: ‘No, you’re too young’. But they see an early death as the ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ even though it will mean Miss Liekens makes an orphan of her son, 17. The pair were inspired by Belgian doctor and right-to-die activist Wim Distelmans, who critics claim has a ‘license to kill anyone’ and issues ‘death on demand’. Pegie Liekens (pictured left and right) suffered serious complications from anti-obesity surgery and can now only consume liquids and soft foods . The cancer specialist has already courted controversy for ending the life of a man who went through a botched sex change operation to become a woman. Should Miss Liekens and Miss Vermeulen follow through on their promise, it will likely reignite the debate in their native Belgium - though it will horrify many in America where euthanasia is only legal in four states and millions bitterly opposing it. The two friends known each other for . 20 years during which time Miss Liekens and Miss Vermeulen have shared . jobs, holidays, endless phone calls and thousands of happy memories. Both . women have elderly parents and only Miss Liekens has a child - she . wants to wait until her son has finished college before taking her own . life. Describing her frustration with her condition, Miss Liekens said: ‘I’m fed up with the food. ‘I want meat and fish. I don’t want to be an old lady unable to drink a glass of champagne or eat a good meal.’ View of the exterior of a building in Zurich, Switzerland, which houses the assisted suicide clinic - where assisted suicide is also legal . Miss Vermeulen said: ‘I try to enjoy life. Some days it works, some days it doesn't. But if I don't want to do it any more, I stop. I pull out the plug.' The two friends are apparently . committed to ending their lives and have downloaded the forms and spoken . to an organisation which can assist them. They admit that some people react as if they are crazy - but that won’t stop them. Miss Liekens said: ‘They say, 'What are you talking about? There are people who are much worse. ‘But people don't feel my pain and suffering.’ She added that for her death will be ‘like a light at the end of a tunnel’. She said: ‘You know that when the point comes that you cannot take it any more, you don't think, 'My God, how am I going to be here in pain?' If you want to get out, it can stop.’ Euthanasia is legal in Belgium but only so long as the patient is in a ‘futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated’. Lawmakers recently amended it to go even further and allow children and Alzheimer’s sufferers to be euthanised. Children will only be covered if they are ‘capable of discernment or affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we cannot alleviate’. Among the patients that Distelmans has helped kill themselves was Belgian Nathan Verhelst, 44, who was born a woman called Nancy. He died of a lethal injection after requesting assisted suicide due to the ‘unbearable psychological suffering’ of his botcher operation which left him looking like a ‘monster’. Distelmans opened the ULteam clinic with colleagues two years ago to help those seeking euthanasia - the name is a pun on the Dutch word for ultimate, meaning final. According to reports in the Belgian media, his team of doctors killed 33 patients in the last year, the first year of the clinic’s operation.","Nancy Vermeulen, 43, suffered serious complication from anti-obesity surgery and can now only consume liquids .

"By . Emma Glanfield . and Luke Salked . Today is the Summer Solstice, otherwise known as the longest day of the year. And it’s not just the druids who will be celebrating – as we are set for a return of the sunshine, with temperatures expected to hit 24C (75F) this weekend. The warm weather is predicted to last throughout tomorrow and could even stretch into the first week of Wimbledon. Forecasters at the Met Office said today and tomorrow will be mainly dry, with bright sunny spells across most of the UK. London and the South East will be the warmest, with a maximum temperature of 24C (75F), while other parts of England and Wales can expect temperatures in the low to mid-twenties. Temperatures are expected to reach 24C across Britain today, including in Brighton (above) for the longest day of the year . Dozens of people flocked to Brighton beach yesterday (pictured) to enjoy the soaring temperatures which are set to last over the weekend before showers return on Monday . Despite it being marginally cooler in the north of England and in Scotland, students from Durham University took to Golden Sands beach at Tynemouth to enjoy the sunshine . Fun in the sun! Katerina, eight, enjoys splashing around in the water with her brother John, four, at Ullswater Lake in the Lake District, Cumbria . Forecaster Helen Waite said: ‘It’s . good outdoors over the weekend. It will be mostly dry and quite . pleasantly warm across the country. It will start to cloud over in the . afternoons but there will be spells of sunshine. Although there is a . good chance of showers by Monday, generally speaking the fine weather . will continue.’ A spokesman for the Weather Channel . backed up the sunny forecast, saying it will be ‘a fine and dry weekend . ahead for most of Britain’. The prognosis also looks good for . Wimbledon attendees, with the tournament starting on Monday – and even . music fans heading for Glastonbury festival on Wednesday could be spared . the traditional wet, muddy scenes. The only negative could be for hay . fever sufferers – with pollen levels expected to be high. A Met Office . spokesman said: ‘It is going to be quite sunny in most places over the . weekend with temperatures continuing to creep up. ‘We are confident the high pressure . will stick around until at least Wednesday and Thursday, though it may . break down, bringing some showers.’ She added: ‘It is a good start to .

His girlfriend looked delighted as they hugged and kissed against the backdrop of the spectacular lake covered with lily pads in the famous 40-acre gardens . The man's proposal came as temperature soared to 23C today, ahead of the first official day of summer tomorrow. The weather is set to remain sunny for the summer solstice, which will be celebrated by many at Stonehenge in Wiltshire . Long bouts of sunshine, holiday excitement and major sporting events all contributed to making Friday the feel-good day of the year, according to wellbeing guru Dr Cliff Arnall. Former Cardiff University lecturer Dr Arnall, who is a happiness coach for celebrities and business leaders, fed every date of the year into a mathematical ‘happiness’ equation and today - the third Friday in June - came out with the highest score. The psychologist’s formula used numbers representing ‘positivity factors’ including the weather, social interaction, holiday anticipation, childhood summer memories and blossoming nature. With temperatures reaching 23C in some parts of the country today, and sunshine set to last the weekend, Dr Arnall believes the weather is key to our happiness. It comes despite England’s defeat to Uruguay in Brazil last night, which Dr Arnall said didn’t affect the mood across the country. Instead, he said the World Cup’s ‘unifying’ positive impact was stronger than worries about the national team and said the national mood was boosted by tennis fans’ ‘great belief’ that Wimbledon champion Andy Murray will retain his crown when the tournament kicks off on Monday. Dr Arnall, 48, based in Powys, Wales, said: ‘No matter what the England team has done in Brazil, the World Cup is a unifying force bringing people of different nations together and giving us an insight into Brazilian culture and fun-loving attitude. ‘And fans enjoy watching big games on TV, no matter who’s playing. O + (N x S) + Cpm/T + He = Happiness . Put more simply, a numerical value for being outdoors (O) was added to nature (N) multiplied by social interaction (S), added to childhood summer memories and positive thoughts (Cpm) divided by temperature (T), and added to holiday excitement (He). ‘Many people love Wimbledon and the event will boost optimism as, for the first time in generations, we have a champion and fans have even greater belief Andy Murray can win it again this year.’ The lifestyle guru also cited economic progress and above-average temperatures as contributions to making today the happiest of the year. He said: ‘Good, dry weather is another feel-good factor after the wet start to the year - bringing great opportunities including beach trips and picnics, plus anticipation of more super weather later in summer. ‘The economy is improving and moving in a positive direction - but many people are still concerned about jobs and financial security. ‘An easy way to get happier is to put more fun in your life - and don’t take yourself too seriously.’ While the weather is contributing to the happiness factor across the country today, the warm temperatures are set to last long into the weekend. The Met Office said this weekend would be mainly dry with bright, sunny spells across most of the country. Temperatures will hit 23C across many parts of the country today before rising to 24C in central London tomorrow. The south-east is in for a fine weekend, with plenty of sunshine, while most of England and Wales will see temperatures in the low to mid-twenties.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Since that discovery, however, questions have arisen not only on its validity, but also its implications for science as a whole. And now if might force us to reconsider how the universe formed, with some suggesting the cosmos didn’t start with a Big Bang but rather a ‘Big Bounce’. Researchers say that our universe may have begun as a Big Bounce rather than just a Big Bang. It suggests that our universe didn¿t necessarily begin from a singularity, but rather 'rebounded' from the collapse of a previous universe, sort of like how a spring (shown) becomes harder to compress as it is squashed . The theory was published in Physical Review Letters by a team of Chinese and Canadian researchers, and follows up on previous work from other scientists, notably Martin Bojowald of Pennstlvania State University in June 2007. The Big Bounce theory states that our universe didn’t necessarily begin from a singularity, but rather ‘rebounded’ from the collapse of a previous universe. And evidence for this apparently exists in the data from the Bicep2 experiment. One of the causes for contention from Bicep2 was that it disagreed with previous experiments for how light should scatter in the universe, reports Ars Technica. This meant either one of the experiments was wrong, or our theories for the universe were not quite correct. The researchers in their paper 'Evidence for Bouncing Evolution Before Inflation After Bicep2' have suggested it may be the latter, if the Big Bounce theory holds true. Astronomers in March using the Bicep2 telescope in Antarctica detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. This is a very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves'. The very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave background radiation - the afterglow of the Big Bang - as they pass through space. The theory suggests that this initial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble. 'It's just unbelievable quite honestly,' Professor Peter Ade, who helped build the instrument that detected the waves, told MailOnline. 'This is confirming what is, to me, a wacky idea. The next step is quite clear; to confirm the data with another technology.' The Bicep2 telescope in Antarctica is seen here at twilight. The telescope has led to significant new results on the early universe, although its recent results have been called into question. The Keck Array telescope and the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station can be seen in the background . The theory relies upon something known as loop quantum gravity (LGQ), which is a way of unifying quantum mechanics and general relavity, itself a manifestation of gravity’s effect on the universe. In basic terms it states the universe can be seen like a fabric of ‘woven’ loop that gives space itself an atomic structure, like matter. Under LQG the gravity would become repulse as the universe became more dense, sort of like how a spring becomes harder to compress as it is squashed. So, if the universe did collapse, it would eventually expand again when it reached a particular size. This process of expanding is known as inflation, evidence for which was found by Bicep2. In this model there would be no Big Bang as we know it, with the universe starting as an infitiely dense singularity, but there would have been a moment the universe expanded from a small size, itself a Big Bang of sorts. This would solve the question of what came before the Big Bang, as it would simply have been the universe contracting before reaching its smallest possible size, and then expanding again. It will take further observations from Bicep2 and other telescopes, however, to explain if this is correct or not. The Big Bounce theory relies upon something known as loop quantum gravity (LGQ), which is a way of unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity (stock image shown). It will take further observations from Bicep2 and other telescopes, however, to explain if this is correct or not .","Researchers in China and Canada propose a new theory for the universe .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Father-of-two Lloyd Butler, 39, from Birmingham, died after having a heart attack in his cell in August 2010 . Police custody officers were watching porn online when they should have been keeping ‘constant watch’ on a father who had a heart attack in his cell and died, an inquest heard. Lloyd Butler, 39, from Birmingham, was supposed to be monitored every 15 minutes but officers were ‘distracted’ by a ‘website about women offering sex’, according to his family’s barrister, Stephen Cragg QC. PC Dean Woodcock had also been making personal telephone calls on the station’s landline and his mobile phone, while Sergeant Mark Albutt was viewing Sky Sports and Next clothing websites while the father-of-two was in their care, it was claimed. Mr Cragg claimed officers had gathered around PC Woodcock’s screen and laughed as they loaded the X-rated website. But PC Woodcock denied the claims when he appeared to give evidence at the inquest held at Birmingham Coroners' Court. He told the hearing: ‘I genuinely can’t remember what that website was. You don’t have sites like that on West Midlands Police computer. They are blocked.’ Mr Butler was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and incapable and taken to Stechford Police Station, West Midlands on August 4, 2010. The 39-year-old was supposed to be ‘roused’ every 15 minutes but officers regularly left him longer. PC Woodcock was also heard on CCTV joking that one way of rousing Mr Butler, whose trousers had fallen down, would be to ‘hit him round the backside’, according to Mr Cragg. Despite classifying Mr Butler as ‘high risk’, officers sent custody nurse Ian O’Hara to assess another prisoner first. There was a 38-minute gap from the last time PC Woodcock checked on Mr Butler until Mr O’Hara entered the cell and immediately spotted he was in trouble. PC Dean Woodcock (pictured outside Birmingham Coroners Court) gave evidence at the inquest after being accused of failing to keep constant watch on the Mr Butler, who was arrested for being drunk and incapable .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A large hole has been spotted on the middle-right of the six wheels on Nasa’s Mars Curiosity rover. The coin-sized dent caused by a sharp rock has left a gaping hole in the tyre. It is the newest of many bumps and bruises the 1-ton vehicle has experienced since it landed on the red planet in August 2012. Scroll down for video . A large hole has been spotted (shown) in the middle-right wheel of Nasa's Curiosity rover on Mars. The dent is the latest in several bumps and bruises the rover has experienced on the red planet, which has surprised engineers. It is not a problem for now but could become one if the hole grows in size . The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 different possible landing sites before deciding to set Curiosity down in Gale Crater. Mission controllers are confident that even with one or several wheels being damaged in this way, they will still be able to achieve Curiosity’s goals. The rover is currently making its way to the base of Mount Sharp, an interesting mountain that could reveal secrets about the history of Mars. While this damage will not hinder the mission, it will be cause for concern as it shows how susceptible it really is to rocks. ‘They are taking damage,’ said Curiosity project manager Jim Erickson in California about the wheels, reports Space.com. ‘That’s the surprise we got back at the end of last year. ‘We always expected we would get some holes in the wheels as we drove. ‘It’s just the magnitude of what we’re seeing that was the surprise.' Curiosity has recently driven out of the ellipse, approximately 4 miles wide and 12 miles long (7 kilometers by 20 kilometers), that was mapped as safe terrain for its 2012 landing inside Gale Crater. It was snapped by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter crossing the 'boundary' on 27 June (pictured) Each of the six alumnium wheels is independently operated and is built to withstand the harshness of the Martian environment. This particular damage is found on the 'grousers' of the wheel (bottom wheel in this image), which is the zigzag-like pattern that helps them grip the terrain . The worst case scenario is that one of the wheels could be completely torn to shreds and become unusable. This would mean it would have to be dragged across the surface of Mars by the other five wheels, and any flailing damage could also pose a risk to exposed wires. The chances of this happening are low, but the engineers are still surprised at how much of a beating the rover has taken in just under two years. One of the main culprits has been ‘caprock’, flat areas of hard Martian rock. In attempts to avoid going over these areas engineers have been trying to spot softer and sandier areas from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter currently circling the planet. Another solution to avoid such damage is to minimise turning, drive backwards of give the wheels greater control with more software. Whether any of these methods will be more successful in future in avoiding damage remains to be seen. One of the main dangers has been 'caprock', flat areas of hard Martian rock (shown). In attempts to avoid going over these areas engineers have been trying to spot softer and sandier areas from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter currently circling the planet . In other Curiosity news, the rover recently celebrated its first complete year on Mars, equating to 687 Earth days. This was done having accomplished the mission's main goal of determining whether Mars once offered environmental conditions favourable for microbial life. One of Curiosity's first major findings after landing on the red planet in August 2012 was an ancient riverbed at its landing site. Nearby, at an area known as Yellowknife Bay, the mission met its main goal of determining whether the Martian Gale Crater ever was habitable for simple life forms. The answer, a historic ‘yes,’ came from two mudstone slabs that the rover sampled with its drill. Analysis of these samples revealed the site was once a lakebed with water, the essential elemental ingredients for life, and a type of chemical energy source used by some microbes on Earth. If Mars had living organisms, this would have been a good home for them. The rover is now making its way to the foothills of Mount Sharp, its ultimate destination since landing on the red planet. This map shows in red the route driven by Nasa's Curiosity rover from the 'Bradbury Landing' location where it touched down in August 2012 (blue star at upper right) to nearly the completion of its first Martian year (green star is current location). The white line shows the planned route ahead .","Engineers in California have seen a large hole on one of Curiosity's wheels .

"By . Emma Glanfield . British shoppers are paying more for gadgets, clothes and accessories than US shoppers because the pound is at a five-year high. Gadgets including the latest Apple iPad and Xbox One are more than £100 cheaper in America than Britain, while accessories are also far less expensive - including a Tiffany Harmony diamond and platinum engagement ring which costs £10,300 in England but only £7,477 in the US. The discounts are due to the current strength of the pound, which has hit $1.70 for the first time since 2009. The study by British Airways compared the price of dozens of products and found clothes, accessories and make-up to be far cheaper in the US than the UK. Gadgets including the Xbox One were also much cheaper . A study by British Airways compared the price of dozens of products and found clothes and make-up also to be far cheaper abroad. Ugg boots cost £60 less in the US, while some Victoria’s Secret items are up to £30 cheaper across the Atlantic. Nike ID trainers are also 41 per cent cheaper in the US than the UK. British Airways said the potential for huge savings made America the top destination this summer for British holidaymakers, with New York deemed the best for stocking up on goods. Claire Bentley, managing director of British Airways Holidays, said: ‘New York is one of the best places in the world to go shopping, especially now you can literally get more bang for your buck. ‘If you’re thrifty enough, the savings you can make could even pay for your trip.’ Many large US department stores are also known to offer further discounts in an attempt to attract international visitors, with Macy’s offering shoppers an additional ten per cent off. The findings come after it was revealed British shoppers are also paying as much as 60 per cent more for high street fashion brands than the rest of Europe. Retail figures revealed global chains including H&M, Zara and Mango hike up prices for their UK customers. New York is one of the top destinations for British shoppers looking for bargains, with many department stores offering further discounts to international visitors, with Macy's offering shoppers an additional ten per cent off . A snapshot survey of 20 items sold by major chains in 14 countries showed the UK to be more expensive than Spain, the US, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Poland. A Zara tunic dress on sale for £49.20 in Spain cost more than £20 more in the UK while t-shirts from the same store worked out to be more than double the price in Britain. Researchers for foreign currency firm Caxton FX found the average UK mark-up for items from the international stores was 18 per cent. The only country which was consistently more expensive than the UK was Switzerland. Global fashion chains typically claim their prices are higher in the UK because rent, rates, staff costs and taxes are higher. But analyst Neil Saunders, from retail consultancy Conlumino, said last month: ‘Retailers will look at each individual country to see what consumers are willing to pay. If they can charge more in the UK, they will.’","Several products far cheaper in US than UK including Xbox One and iPads .

"By . Lucy Buckland . Updated: . 11:56 EST, 13 December 2011 . Naked cop: Andy Easterby sparked a police chase after being spotted behind the wheel, in the nude . A former PC sparked a dangerous police chase after he was spotted driving naked following a seaside romp with his girlfriend. Shamed Andy Easterby sped off from officers who spotted him driving in the nude, leading his former colleagues on a chaotic car chase through Scarborough town centre at 3am. The 30-year-old was eventually caught crouching behind a wheelie bin ‘sporting nothing but a pair of shoes and socks’ after trying to evade capture. Yesterday the former York police officer was jailed for six months after pleading guilty to dangerous driving. A court heard, with smoking tyres, Easterby twice went through No Entry signs, driving the wrong way down several one-way streets, and turning off his headlights in a bid to get away from officers. York Crown Court heard Easterby and his girlfriend had been on a day trip to the North Yorkshire resort when he’d taken off his clothes to have sex with her in their car. But the former officer, who was forced to resign from the force after being caught drink driving, was spotted by a CCTV operator who tipped off police after spotting Easterby was driving naked as he drove through the town centre at 3am on April 25. Two armed officers approached and ordered Easterby, who had just romped with his then partner in her car, to stop where he was. But, while his girlfriend sat in the passenger seat, he reversed away before leading the officers on the high speed chase through Scarborough town centre. Seaside romp: Andy Easterby was naked after having sex with his girlfriend in Scarborough when he was caught driving through the town at 3am . The former York PC sped the wrong way down three one-way streets and went through two entry signs to lose the police officers. He was eventually found crouching behind a wheelie bin after abandoning his car. Chris Moran, defending, said Easterby’s actions had been committed out of embarrassment. ‘Two times in his life he has done . something reckless, stupid and impulsive and both times he has paid a . considerable price for it.’ It was the second time the former police officer had broken the law -in 2009, he was banned from driving for a year after he was caught drink-driving. Following his drink-drive conviction, he . was forced to resign from the police after eight years in the job that . had been his childhood dream. He had just taken the sergeants’ exam. Mr Moran, defending, said: ‘Two times in his life he has done something reckless, stupid and impulsive and both times he has paid a considerable price for it.’ Easterby, of Leeds, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving on Monday. He was also banned from driving for three years and ordered to retake his driving test. Judge Stephen Ashurst told the former neighbourhood police team member: ‘This is a difficult day, I know, for you. ‘I have to take account not only of the strong personal mitigation in your case, but also the public interest in seeking to deter people from driving dangerously, particularly when they are pursued by police, where the sensible course is to stop.’",Andy Easterby found 'crouching behind wheelie bin sporting nothing but a pair of shoes and socks' after abandoning car .
"By . Francesca Chambers . Hillary is lucky to have Bill as her dance partner, former Republican presidential . candidate and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said yesterday on CNN's . Crossfire, because she's as ungraceful as Kim Kardashian at a Prince concert . 'Bill is to . politics what Fred Astaire is to dancing, he is just automatically . amazing and he wants to have Ginger Rogers out there dancing,' Gingrich, . who co-hosts the show, said according to Politico. 'Instead . [with Hillary Clinton] it’s a little bit like watching Kim Kardashian . get kicked off the stage by Prince because she couldn’t dance.' 'I think there’s a big problem, because I don’t think, as a candidate, that [she] dances very well,' Gingrich said of Hillary. Not welcome 'round these parts: Hillary Clinton would 'probably get shot at the state line' if she tried to campaign for president in Arkansas in 2016, a GOP official from the state said yesterday . Hillary and Bill Clinton have been hit with a slew of attacks throughout the last several months as Republicans gear up for the 2016 presidential race . Speculation over Hillary's political plans has encouraged a new round of attacks on the Clintons throughout the past several months. Nothing's been off limits in the 2016 firefight, and Republicans have thrown everything including the kitchen sink at the former first family in hopes that Hillary will rethink her presidential aspirations. Bill's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the '90s, Hillary's early career as a criminal defense lawyer, a spill Hillary took as secretary of state that caused a concussion - those are just a few incidents in the Clinton family's past that Hilary's opponents have exploited in the media since April. Hillary has contributed to her fair share of critical media coverage, however, making gaffes left and right at her numerous speaking events. Hillary's latest memoir, Hard Choices, provided additional ammunition for the right when it was released earlier this month. The most notable chink in the Clinton's political armor came during one of Hillary's first interviews to promote her book. Hillary told ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill were 'dead broke' when they left the White House. 'We had no money when we got there, and . we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, . for houses, for Chelsea's education. You know, it was not easy,' Hillary said. Attempts by the Clinton family to amend the statement have only led to more stories about their wealth and complaints that Hillary is 'out of touch.' A follow-up comment by Hillary that the former first family was roughly $12 million in debt at the end of Bill's presidency was rebutted by evidence that she and Bill made that much money in their first year out of the White House. Bill . Clinton has made more than $106 million in speaking fees alone since his . days as the 42nd president of the United States, and he received a . nifty $15 million advance payment for his 2004 autobiography, My Life. Hillary . Clinton has made $5 million off of speaking gigs since she left the . Obama administration and received upward of $8 million for Hard Choices. That's in addition to the $8 million she received for her 2003 memoir . Living History. Chelsea Clinton is on a $600,000 a year contract with NBC News on top of her salary at the Clinton Foundation. Recent estimates put Bill and Hillary's combined net worth at $100 million or more. Kim Kardashian leaves a doctor's office with baby North West this morning. Newt Gingrich compared Hillary Clinton to the reality TV star last night on an episode of Crossfire . In an interview with the Guardian published over the weekend, Hillary said her wealth doesn't hurt her image with poor people. 'They don't see me as . part of the problem because we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of . people who are truly well off - not to name names,' Clinton said. 'And we've done it through dint of hard work.' Yesterday Bill attempted to come to his wife's rescue at a Clinton Global Initiative America event. Bill told NBC host David Gregory during an on-stage interview that Hillary advocated for legal assistance . for the poor in law school, and in the '70s she fought for paid leave for new mothers. 'She's not out of touch,' he said. 'We go to our local grocery store on the weekend. We talk to people in our town. We know what's going on.' 'The real issue is, if you've been fortunate enough to be successful, are you now out of touch and insensitive to the agonizing struggles other people are facing?' Clinton asked. 'It is factually true that we were several million dollars in debt,' he said at another point. Bill also said he doesn't think that average Americans will be offended by his family's post presidential success. 'I don't think most Americans resent somebody else doing well. They . resent that they're not getting a fair deal. They want the bottom to . grow. They want the middle to grow,' he said. After the event, Hillary told PBS it was 'very sweet' of Bill to defend her, but 'I don’t need anybody to defend my record. 'I think my record speaks for itself.'

In addition to her salary at the Clinton Foundation, Chelsea makes $50,000 a month off of NBC News .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Pop star Gary Glitter, 70, arrived at Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning wearing a cream suit, pink shirt, hat and dark, tinted sunglasses . Gary Glitter was told off for wearing sunglasses as he appeared in court today charged with a string of historic sex attacks on two underage girls. The former pop star, who appeared under his real name Paul Gadd, is charged with eight sex offences against girls aged under 16 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The allegations include claims that he plied one of the girls with alcohol so he could have sex with her. Dressed in a beige three-piece suit, pink shirt, cream scarf and wearing tinted glasses, Glitter spoke only to confirm his name, age and address during the brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in central London. He entered no plea during the hearing which lasted less than five minutes. Looking tanned and sporting a white goatee beard, the 1970s glam rock star removed his Panama hat before the start of the proceedings. However, he kept his dark, tinted glasses on, which his defence barrister Christopher Ware explained was necessary because of a 'medical condition'. He added that no ‘disrespect to the court’ was intended. However, deputy chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot was unimpressed and said they would not be acceptable at his next appearance. Glitter spoke slowly and in a clear voice to give his personal details, spelling out his surname, during the hearing. The 70-year-old, from Marylebone in central London, is accused of eight charges, with six relating to one girl and two to another. He is accused of four counts of indecent assault against the first alleged victim, who was aged 12 or 13 at the time, between January 1977 and December that year. Glitter is accused of administering a drug – ‘namely alcohol’ - with the intention to ‘stupefy or overpower’ the girl to enable him to have sex with her between January and May 1977. He also faces one charge of unlawful intercourse with a girl aged under 13 between the same dates. The former singer is accused of . another two counts of indecent assault against a second complainant, who . was aged 13 or 14 at the time, between October 1979 and December 1980. Judge Arbuthnot bailed Glitter until a hearing at Southwark Crown Court on July 3. He was surrounded by photographers as he left following today's hearing, before being driven off in a black taxi. Glitter was the first suspect to be . arrested by Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree in 2012, the investigation . set up after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a prolific paedophile.

"By . Francesca Chambers . One of Sgt Bowe Bergdahl's captors lost a son in a CIA drone strike in an incident that has intriguing similarities with the hit HBO Homeland, it was revealed today. Four years ago, in an untelevised speech at an Idaho Republican Party fundraiser, Bergdahl's father, Bob, made an unusual request of his audience. The grieving father asked attendees of the event to say a prayer for the head of the terrorist network he believed was holding his son hostage. Prayer: bob Bergdahl (with wife Jani) made a speech making the drone claim and asked the audience to say a prayer for the terrorist holding his son hostage . 'The man who we believe holds Bowe grew up on the lap of his mother learning the Koran. He is a powerful man,' Bergdahl said, according to a reporter there. 'We pray for him. He recently lost a son to a CIA missile drone strike. The fact that he didn't kill Bowe right then is incredible. So we pray for him.' The man Bob Bergdahl spoke of was Sirajuddin Haqqani – leader of the Haqqani terrorist network. Earlier that year, family members of Haqqani were allegedly killed in a U.S. drone strike intended for the Taliban commander. According to a secret report created by the Pakistani government that was obtained and published by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism earlier this year, 19 missiles were fired in the February 2, 2010, attack and at least 23 people were killed. CNN ran a report on the day of the strike confirming that 29 people total were killed in drone strikes that day in Pakistan. That report made no mention of Haqqani’s home being hit, but CNN did quote an anonymous source as saying that Haqqani was indeed the target of the drone strikes. A year and a . half later, hit series Homeland would embark on a plotline eerily . similar to the one in the story told by Bowe Bergdahl’s father at the . Idaho GOP event in June of 2010. In . an episode revealing why Marine Sgt Nicholas Brody (played by Damian . Lewis) became a terrorist after he was captured and tortured for eight . years by Al Qaeda leader Abu Nazir in Afghanistan, Brody is brainwashed . and becomes a devotee of Nazir and Islam. Echoes: the incident has similarities with the plot from Homeland, in which Sgt Nicholas Brody turns terrorist after the son of his captor is blown up in a CIA drone strike . Nazir takes him back to his home, and asks him to teach his son Issa how to speak English. Brody falls in love with Issa, and, in shocking scene, witnesses the brutal death of Issa and eighty other children at his madrassa. After this, Brody returns to the U.S. determined to seek revenge for Issa's death. Bowe Bergdahl had written home before he was captured in 2009 about how deeply effected he was that his brothers in arms were not bothered when they ran over a young Afghan child in an armored car. In May of 2011 Bob Bergdahl posted a video to YouTube thanking the Taliban for keeping his son safe. 'Strangely to some, we must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years. We know our son is a prisoner and also a guest in your home,' he said. While his son was gone, Bob Bergdahl reportedly studied radical Islamic politics, the Bergdahl family’s former pastor told the Washington Post, and he kept a beard like the ones adorned by Bowe’s captors. Bergdahl says he grew the lengthy beard to remind people how long his son had been gone, but skeptics believe the patriarch might have had an ulterior motive for keeping his facial hair long. A few days before Bowe's release, Bob, sent the following tweet to a website that claims to be the ‘Voice of Jihad’: ‘I am still working to free all Guantanamo prisoners. God will repay for the death of every Afghan child, ameen.’ The tweet has since been deleted. In a video posted by the Guardian on the weekend his son was released, Bob said he was just 'a father who wants his son back.’ His critics say he’s taken it too far, though. Friends of the Bergdahl’s worry that Bob may even have developed some sort of Stockholm syndrome, Henley said. Meanwhile, Fox News reported on Thursday that Bowe Bergdahl was more than just a prisoner in a Taliban commander’s home. According to documents based on eyewitness accounts that were obtained by Fox, after an initial period of harsh treatment, Bergdahl became a Taliban confidant and converted to Islam and jihadism while in captivity. 'Bergdahl enjoys a modicum of freedom, and engages in target practice with the local mujahedeen, firing AK47s. Bergdahl is even allowed to carry a loaded gun on occasion,' the report claims, according to Fox. 'Bergdahl plays soccer with his guards and bounds around the pitch like a mad man,' it continues. 'He appears to be well and happy, and has a noticeable habit of laughing frequently and saying ""Salaam"" repeatedly.' Salaam means 'peace'. At . that time, Bergdahl was being held in Pakistan by Haqqani Network . commander Mullah Sangeen or men who are close to him, the report says. Not Sirajuddin Haqqani himself, as Bob Bergdahl claimed. Claims: Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken today said that trying Bergdahl in the court of public opinion was 'repugnant' before he could defend himself. It followed reports that the POW had converted to Islam and even declared 'jihad' while in captivity . A retired U.S. Marine Corps General who served as CENTCOM commander for two years when Bowe Bergdahl was being held prisoner said the claims made in the documents were not true, though. 'We were always looking for actionable intelligence,' he said, referring to the military and the intelligence community. 'There was never any evidence of collaboration.' Meanwhile, deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said trying Bergdahl in the court of public opinion was 'repugnant', The Hill reported. He said 'we have seen no evidence' of the claims that Bergdahl converted or declared jihad, adding: 'The idea that we are trying Sergeant Bergdahl in the court of public opinion in absentia, without giving him an opportunity to give his story and to tell us what happened, frankly, I find repugnant'. Blinken concluded: 'We don't know what happened. We are determined to get to the bottom of it. The military will investigate appropriately. Let's get the facts before we rush to judgment.'","A story told four years ago by Sgt. Bowe Begdahl's father about his son's captor is eerily similar to a plotline in Homeland .

That man's son, Bob said, was killed in a U.S. drone strike earlier that year .
A year and a half later, the HBO hit Homeland would air an episode in which former POW and Marine Sgt. Nicholas Brody is revealed to have 'turned' against his country after his captor's son, Issa, was killed in a drone strike .
Brody converted to Islam and took up jihadism after Issa's death .
There have been conflicting reports on whether Bowe Bergdahl has done the same ."
"By . Francesca Chambers . Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that she has no 'absolutely no' interest in giving pot a try. 'I didn't do it when I was young, I'm not gonna start now,' Clinton told CNN's Christiane Amanpour during a televised town hall on Tuesday. The subject brought out Clinton's lighter side, sending the often stoic former secretary of state into giggles. 'There are younger people here who can help me understand this and answer it,' Clinton jovially said as soon as the question about her views on marijuana appeared on screen at the town hall. Hillary Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she's still against legalizing marijuana at the federal level . Perhaps Hillary's husband Bill Clinton could also help her understand the allure of weed. Bill infamously said during his 1992 presidential election that, 'When I was in . England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and didn't like . it. 'I didn't inhale, and I didn't try it again,' he said. Prior to Tuesday's town hall it was unclear if Hillary had ever puffed the magic dragon. The last time that Clinton publicly commented on marijuana was during the 2008 presidential election. At that time she said, 'I don't think we should decriminalize, but we ought to do research into what, if any, medical benefits it has.' Six years later, and Clinton's views on use of the substance haven't budged. 'I think we need to be very clear about the benefits of marijuana use . for medicinal purposes. I don't think we've done enough research yet,' Clinton told an audience of about 200 people during CNN's town hall style event. 'There's a lot that we don't know,' she said, such as how it reacts with other drugs. The presumed 2016 candidate said medical marijuana should be available 'under appropriate circumstances' to people with 'extreme medical conditions,' however. As to whether she thinks that recreational marijuana use should be decriminalized, Clinton said she wanted to 'wait and see what the evidence is' coming out of Colorado and Washington, two states that recently made recreational use legal. 'You know that states are the laboratory of Democracy,' she said. 'There are younger people here who can help me understand this and answer it,' Clinton jovially said as soon as the question about her views on marijuana appeared on screen at the town hall . Hillary Clinton, right, wore a custom made pant suit created by Ralph Lauren, left, throughout her activities in D.C. today, which included attending a ceremony to honor the famous designer at the American History museum. A spokesperson for the designer did not say how much the suit cost, but the bag Clinton was carrying today, not visible in this picture, has a retail value of $2,500 . One issue area in which Clinton's views have significantly shifted since the time she was actively involved in politics is the sanctity of marriage. On Tuesday Clinton said she was 'very, very proud to state that I'm a full supporter of marriage equality right now.' A little more than a decade ago, Clinton said in an interview on CBS News that like the 'vast majority' of Americans she was against gay marriage. She again affirmed her opposition to same-sex marriage during the Democratic presidential primary in 2007. After leaving the Obama administration last year, Clinton changed her mind, saying in a video for the Human Rights campaign last March she now believes same-sex couples should be able to marry 'personally and as a matter of policy and law.' Clinton admitted on Tuesday that she had 'evolved' on the issue over the years, 'In large measure based on the . experiences that I had with so many people who I knew and cared about.' 'And . it really became very clear to me that if we're going to support . marriage in our country, it should be available to everyone regardless . of who they love and that this marriage equality issue is a great human . rights issue,' Clinton said. The hour-long town hall, held at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., is one of the latest . episodes in Clinton's media blitz to promote her recently released book . Hard Choices. Clinton also stopped by Fox News on Tuesday evening for a joint . interview with Special Report host Bret Baier and On the Record host . Greta Van Susteren. Earlier in the day she attended the 2014 Naturalization Ceremony at the National Museum of American History, where designer Ralph Lauren was honored with the James Smithson Bicentennial Medel. Lauren was saluted at the Smithsonian museum that houses the Star-Spangled banner for donating $13 million to a public-private partnership Clinton founded as the first lady in 1998 to help preserve national treasures like the famous American flag. Throughout the day Clinton wore a custom Ralph Lauren Collection suit that a spokeswoman for the designer described to Washington Whispers as a cobalt-blue structured silk jacket and pant, . paired with a silk charmeuse blouse. The spokeswoman did not say how much Clinton's suit cost, but Whispers columnist Nikki Schwab found that the white Ralph Lauren Collection Soft Ricky Bag that Clinton carried with her on Tuesday had a retail value of $2,500.","During a town hall on CNN on Tuesday night Hillary Clinton was asked about her position on medical and recreational marijuana usage .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Democratic lawmakers are beginning to distance themselves from president Barack Obama's decision to trade five known associates of the Taliban with the terrorist network in exchange for the release of accused deserter Bowe Bergdahl. One Democratic lawmaker called Obama’s Taliban trade 'a dangerous precedent' as others are now reluctant to praise the president's choice. Even after White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough talked with Senators from the president's party at their weekly policy luncheon on Tuesday, Democrats wouldn't verbally support Obama's judgment call. The White House officially went into damage-control mode on Wednesday, announcing that Pentagon and intelligence officials would brief the Senate on the deal late Wednesday behind closed doors. The House of Representatives is in recess and will not return until next week. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Panic: Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., is surrounded by reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday. Levin is defending President Barack Obama's decision to swap five members of the Taliban for  Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl but many in his party are becoming increasingly disquiet . 'Deserter': Senior Dem Dutch Ruppersberger today said Bergdahl's release (exchange caught on video above) in the swap with five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo put Americans at risk all around the world . Damning: Rep. Ruppersberger added: 'Since World War Two we have not negotiated with terrorists or other groups' Dutch Ruppersberger, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued the strongest rebuke of Obama from a Democrat so far when he said on Tuesday that the trade set a 'dangerous precedent that puts all Americans at risk throughout the world.' 'Since World War Two we have not negotiated with terrorists or other groups,' Ruppersberger told the Baltimore Sun. 'What concerns me is the future. This puts all Americans at risk throughout the world, including our men and women on the front line…for kidnapping.' A dozen Democratic Senators refused to put their approval on record when approached by The Weekly Standard on Tuesday, and several used a classified briefing they were to receive today on the matter as an excuse to delay a verdict. 'I just don't know enough about it. I really don't,' Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told the Weekly Standard yesterday afternoon. 'All I've heard is what I've read in the press,' Vermont Sen. Pat Leahy said. 'I don't have enough information at this point in time,' Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said. 'I do think getting our boys back home, that's a good quality. I do have some issues about whether [Bergdahl] deserted or not.' 'It depends on all the facts and circumstances of the case,' Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin said. 'I'm not going to give you a conclusion in the case because I don't know all the circumstances.' 'I'm not going to comment until I look at the brief,' Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said, backtracking from her claim on Sunday that Obama 'acted within his constitutional authority, which he should have done,' to do the deed. 'It's very disturbing,' said West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. 'Everything you hear.' 'I'm going to reserve judgment until after we have a secured briefing tomorrow,' Manchin, a vulnerable Democrat up for re-election this year, said. The president and his administration hoped to be basking in the glow of Bergdahl's release right up to November's federal elections. But rumors began to fly quickly that Bergdahl had purposefully wandered off base on the evening in question with no intention of returning. Fading support: A host of Democrats contacted today would not go on public record in support of Obama (pictured today in Brussels, Belgium with German Chancellor Angela Merkel) Coupled . with news that search and rescue efforts for Bergdahl resulted in the . deaths of at least six soldiers, and the president's admission on Monday . that it's 'absolutely' possible that the newly released Taliban . fighters could return to the battlefield, the Bergdahl bounce began wear . off. The . Obama administration also fumbled the play by not telling Congress . about the negotiations until the deal had already been sealed. The judgment lapse had lawmakers – whom the president is required to notify 30 days before releasing detainees from the Guantanmo Bay detention camp in Cuba – on both sides of the aisle fuming this week. The president tried to temper criticism on Monday by claiming that lawmakers had known for 'quite some time' about the government's negotiations with the Taliban, but his remarks were met with immediate resistance. Later that evening, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken called Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chair Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, and committee vice-chairman, Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, to apologize for the 'oversight.' Feinstein told reports on Tuesday that the last official communication she had with administration officials about the proposition of trading prisoners from Guantanmo Bay for Bergdahl was two and a half years ago. Feinstein said she and Chambliss sent then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a letter in December of 2011 and president Obama a letter in January 2012 with questions about the trade and both letters were met with detailed responses. But that was the last time she'd heard about the swap until Saturday, when she received a call informing her that Bergdahl and the five Taliban fighters had been released. 'Given the past briefings and concerns we had addressed, and these were from both [congressional intelligence] committees and the leadership of both committees, the concerns were bipartisan, and I strongly believe that we should have been consulted,' Feinstein told reporters on Tuesday. 'I think you can see that we're very dismayed about it,' she added. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who is a former Senate Intelligence chairman and still serves on the committee, said he shares in Feinstein's disappointment. 'I don't like it when the White House says the Intelligence committees were briefed. Because we weren't,' he told Politco on Tuesday. Rockefeller . said he would have been fine with the administration telling only . senior members of the committee, 'but when they say, ""Oh yes, they were . briefed,"" what they are referring to is 2011-2012 when I was still in . grade school.' Senate . Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin defended president Obama on Tuesday . for making the call without Congress's explicit approval. Yet, even he . said ,'I intend to ask what risks we would have incurred if the . secretary of defense had decided to wait 30 days after completing . negotiations and providing the required notice to Congress rather than . acting immediately.' Rush to judgment: Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel today said it was 'unfair to presume anything' about the claims of Bergdahl's desertion at a press conference today in Brussels . 'One of the issues I want to bring up: What is the precedent this sets or doesn't set?'  Sen. Mark Begich told Politico on Wednesday. House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are the only two lawmakers visibly standing by the president. 'I support the president, and that means I support their understanding of what threat those people who were released with would be to our country,' Pelosi said on Tuesday at an event in Boston, Massachusetts. 'I'm saying I believe that the president has the assurances that he needs that those people will not be a threat to the American people,' Pelosi continued. Reid said on the Senate floor today that, 'President Obama, as Commander-in-Chief, acted honorably in helping an American soldier return home to his family,' 'Unfortunately, opponents of President Obama have seized upon the release of an American prisoner of war, using what should be a moment of unity and celebration for our nation, as a chance to play political games,' he continued. Reid argued that even if Sgt. Bergdahl deserted, it's up to the military to punish him. 'What was the alternative? Would any American honestly prefer that a U.S. soldier remain in captivity until all of the questions have been answered?' Reid asked. 'Of course not. In the United States of America, we rescue our soldiers first and ask questions later.' Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel today said it was 'unfair to presume anything' about the claims of Bergdahl's desertion at a press conference today in Brussels. He repeated that the US had a responsibility to get its soldiers back. 'Let's get the facts, but forst let's focus on getting Sgt Bergdahl well.'","Democratic lawmakers are distancing themselves from Obama's decision to swap terrorist prisoners for Sgt.

"By . James Rush . and Associated Press . Oscar Pistorius was not suffering from a mental illness when he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, a panel of mental health experts has concluded. The chief prosecutor at the athlete's murder trial referred to key parts . of the conclusions today as the hearing resumed following a month's break. During this time, a psychologist and three psychiatrists also assessed whether the double-amputee runner was capable of understanding the wrongfulness of his act when he shot Steenkamp through a closed toilet door. Scroll down for video . A panel of health experts has concluded Oscar Pistorius (pictured listening to evidence today) was not suffering from a mental illness when he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, his trial heard today . Back in court: After a six-week break, Oscar Pistorius arrives in court in Pretoria to resume his murder trial . The panel's reports were submitted to . Judge Thokozile Masipa, with prosecutor Gerrie Nel noting that the experts believed Pistorius was . 'capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act' when he killed . Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model. 'At the time of the alleged offences, the accused did not suffer from a mental disorder or mental defect that affected his ability to distinguish between the rightful or wrongful nature of his deeds,' Mr Nel read from a report submitted to the court. Both Mr Nel and defence lawyer Barry Roux accepted the findings of the panel of psychiatrists and psychologists after 30 days of evaluation. The trial promptly resumed as Mr Roux called surgeon Gerald Versfeld, who amputated Pistorius' lower legs when he was 11 months old, to testify about the runner's disability and the difficulty and pain he endured while walking or standing on his stumps without support. Pistorius was born without fibulas, the slender bones that run from below the knee to the ankle. At Roux's invitation, Judge Masipa and her two legal assessors left the dais to closely inspect the stumps of Pistorius as he sat on a bench. The panel's reports were submitted to Judge Thokozile Masipa, and prosecutor Gerrie Nel referred to key parts of the conclusions, noting that the experts believed Pistorius was 'capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act' when he killed Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model . Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has alleged that Pistorius, 27, killed Steenkamp after a Valentine's Day argument, and has portrayed the Olympic athlete as a hothead with a love of guns and an inflated sense of entitlement . The athlete was on his stumps when he . killed Steenkamp, and his defense team has argued that he was more . likely to try to confront a perceived danger rather than flee because of . his limited ability to move without prostheses. Versfeld noted that Pistorius' disability made him 'vulnerable in a dangerous situation.' During . cross examination, Nel questioned Versfeld's objectivity and raised the . possibility that Pistorius could have run away from a perceived . intruder on the night of the shooting. He . also said Pistorius rushed back to his bedroom after the shooting and . made other movements that indicated he was not as hampered as Versfeld . was suggesting. Later in the hearing, the judge said she . was 'very unhappy' that the state were unable to . produce a piece of evidence - an electrical cord - from Pistorius' house. Oscar Pistorius sits in the dock during his ongoing murder trial in Pretoria, South Africa, today . Pistorius speaks with his defence lawyer Barry Roux in the dock during his ongoing murder trial . Roux also called acoustics expert Ivan Lin to testify about the challenges of hearing something accurately from a distance. Neighbors have said in court that they heard a woman screaming on the night Pistorius shot Steenkamp, which could bolster the prosecution's claim that the couple were arguing before Pistorius opened fire. The defense, however, has suggested the witnesses were actually hearing the high-pitched screams of a distraught Pistorius after he realized he had shot Steenkamp. The psychiatric . evaluation came after a psychiatrist, Dr. Merryll Vorster, testified . for the defense that Pistorius, who has said he feels vulnerable because . of his disability and long-held worry about crime, had an anxiety . disorder that could have contributed to the killing in the early hours . of February 14, 2013.

"By . James Rush . The ousted founder of American Apparel has accused the board of conducting a 'hateful campaign' against him. Dov Charney was fired last week with the board citing his alleged misuse of company funds and role in disseminating nude photos of an ex-employee who filed a case against him in 2011. But Mr Charney, 45, has now described the allegations as false and insisted he is still the 'best man for this job'. Dov Charney has accused the board of American Apparel of conducting a 'hateful campaign' against him . In his first interview since being fired, Mr Charney told the Financial Times: 'I think it's highly unusual that a board - any board - would indulge in such a hateful PR campaign against its founder.' American Apparel most recently said that they decided to fire Charney based on information saying he allowed an employee to impersonate and post naked photos online of a former employee who sued Charney in 2011 for $260 million after she claimed he forced her to be his 'sex slave.' The case was thrown out in 2012 but the former employer was subject to an online campaign to discredit her and Charney is now facing claims he failed to stop it. The New York Post . has reported that Charney was expected to say that he did not know about the . blog before it was published online and therefore isn't responsible for . the 'liabilities' cited by American Apparel. Charney's . lawyers have pointed out that the board renewed his employment in April . 2012; more than a year after the blog was published. On Monday, the independent directors of the retailer rejected a demand to meet and reinstate Mr Charney, a source close to the matter said. Irene Morales, 21, said that Charney allegedly made her his sex slave and new information states Charney may have allowed an employee to impersonate her online . Charney's lawyer demanded a meeting on Monday, and the board's refusal to meet with and reinstate him makes a legal battle with the ex-CEO, who still controls 27 percent of the company's stock, more likely. In the letter to the board, sent on Thursday, lawyer Patricia Glaser said the company had failed to give Charney 21 days' notice of his severance package as required by law, making his dismissal 'not only unconscionable but illegal.' A link to the letter, whose receipt the source familiar with the matter confirmed, was provided in an article on the Wall Street Journal's website. The letter threatened legal action should Mr Charney not regain his executive positions. Mad genius? Dov Charney, 45, a Canadian national, started American Apparel in 1991 as a humble wholesale T-shirt manufacturer . The board sees no point in meeting with Charney at this time, the source said. The management shakeup followed years of company stagnation, as the company amassed more than $250 million in debt. The . company's co-chairman, meanwhile, has also said this week the company . was not for sale and that the search for a new chief executive had . generated 'enormous interest.' Big business: American Apparel currently employs 10,000 employees and operates 249 retail stores in 20 countries . Explosive allegations: In 2011, Irene Morales (left) sued Dov Charney (right) accusing him of treating her as a 'sex slave' Allan Mayer, the company's new co-chairman, also told Reuters that American Apparel did not need immediate capital. He said: 'We are certainly not looking to sell the company. 'If . someone came and said they want to buy American Apparel for $10 per . share, we'd be crazy to not listen ... but by no means looking to sell . now.'","Founder of American Apparel Dov Charney was ousted from role last week .

"By . James Rush . These heartbreaking pictures show the moments after a hyena gave birth to two cubs after getting caught in a snare. The new-born cubs were discovered by conservationists in the Savé Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe, after they were informed by anti-poaching scouts of a hyena in a trap. It is believed the heavily pregnant hyena had a 'trauma birth', brought on by the stress of being caught in the trap. A hyena gave birth to two cubs after getting caught in a snare in the Savé Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe . The two cubs were discovered lying metres from their mother by conservationists after they were informed by anti-poaching scouts of a hyena in a trap .

Yet despite the mother's despair, Dr Rosemary Groom, project director at the African Wildlife Conservation Fund, said the hyena had managed to create a shallow den for her cubs underneath where she was trapped. Dr Groom, who was helped in the rescue mission by ranch manager, Duke Cloete, and an anti-poaching scout, said: 'After being informed by anti-poaching scouts, we found the adult caught half way up a shallow-sloped bank near a small water pool. 'We darted her in the rump and moved off quickly to allow the drugs to take effect with minimal stress to the animal. 'As we watched her fall asleep we noticed there was a ""complication"". 'There was one tiny cub on the slope near the adult and when we got closer there was another tiny cub in the shallow scraping under where she was sitting.

The conservation team put the two tiny cubs on to their mother to suckle while they tried to help her from the snare . The team blindfolded the hyena to ensure that removing the snare was less stressful for the animal. They then lifted the wire from around her chest and, once the snare was removed, cleaned the wounds to prevent infection. Dr Groom said: 'Fortunately the snare around the mother was not too bad - it was around the chest on one side, rather than the neck and hadn't cut in too deeply. 'Whilst we cleaned her wounds with penicillin, we noticed an old wound around her neck from a snare - clearly she had been caught before and managed to get out.' When the team went back the next day the mother and cubs had moved on . Dr Rosemary Groom, project director at the African Wildlife Conservation Fund said: 'I am confident she would have moved her cubs off to the safety of a den later that evening' When the team went back the next day the mother and cubs had moved on.

"By . James Rush . These are the shocking injuries inflicted on a disabled teenager who is now scared to go out alone after being attacked twice in eight months on the same road. Michael Disley, 19, has temporarily moved back in with his mother and stepfather following the two attacks. In the latest incident, on June 4, Mr Disley, who has learning difficulties and Asperger's Syndrome, was targeted by thugs who hit his head against the pavement. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Teenager Michael Disley was left with these horrific injuries after he was attacked for the second time in eight months on the same road . Mr Disley,  who has learning difficulties and Asperger Syndrome, has now been left scared to go out alone following the latest attack on June 4 when he was targeted by thugs who hit his head against the pavement . The teenager, who lives an independent life, was walking along a road in Wigan, Greater Manchester, to his mother's house when two men pushed him to the ground and attacked him. He said: 'I’m really scared to go outside without someone I can trust. 'I don’t know why I was attacked on either occasion, I had my backpack with me and they didn’t try and steal anything. 'They just wanted to hurt me.' The assault comes just eight months after Mr Disley was chased by three men who cornered him in a house before beating him up. The men were arrested for the attack before being released without charge after apologising to Mr Disley. Police are appealing for anyone who may have seen anything in the area of . Lancaster Road, in Wigan, to come forward . His stepfather Les Watkinson said: 'When they arrested the other men for the first attack it didn’t get to court because they apologised. 'It cost Michael £140 for a new pair of glasses and now he has to go through it all again because they smashed them again. 'We said to the police this time that we’re not letting this one go even if it’s just to pay for his glasses. 'Michael is a vulnerable adult, he has learning difficulties and Asperger’s which is why he’s being targeted.' The latest assault comes just eight months after Mr Disley was chased by three men who cornered him in a house before beating him up . Mr Disley does not know who attacked him in the most recent incident as the men did not speak during the assault. He said: 'I was just walking back to my mum’s house when I felt something from behind. 'I just kept walking and then suddenly someone jumped me and I just went down. My face hit the pavement and as I lifted my head back up, they punched me back down again and again. 'It scared me last time but I got over it and now it has happened again. I got my own place but my mum wants me to stay at her house for a bit now, and I’ve been getting lifts to and from my friends now so I’m safe. 'Before these attacks, we never really had anything too bad. I used to just go to the skating rink and no-one had problems with me. I had silly name calling but that didn’t get to me.' Mr Disley has now temporarily moved back in with his mother and stepfather. His mother Diane Disley said: 'We dont want to bad-mouth the police because we were just lucky they were there but something needs to be done. 'He’s not a trouble-maker, he doesn't have a fighting bone in his body which is why he can’t defend himself. 'They know Michael and know he’s not a fighter so they will get a kick out of that and he’s targeted because of his disability. It’s just sick isnt it? 'We just want anyone who saw anything that night to come forward now and help catch those responsible. 'All he wants to do is lead a full and independent life but now feels he is being prevented from doing so.' Police are appealing for anyone who may have seen anything in the Lancaster Road area of Wigan to come forward. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'At 11.55pm, officers were alerted to a man who said he was going to his mum’s when two men pushed him to the ground from behind. 'When he tried to get up, they punched him back down. Unfortunately he can’t identify anyone and there is no CCTV showing the assault. 'We are appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time to come forward and help find those responsible.' Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 or independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Michael Disley says he is too scared to go out alone following the attacks .

"By . James Rush . This is the shocking moment a police officer shattered a man's eye-socket as he arrested him after he threw a paper cup out of a car window. Mohaib Qurban was left with horrific injuries following the arrest in Birmingham city centre in March 2012. A West Midlands Police officer is now facing a disciplinary hearing following the incident, the force has confirmed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CCTV captured part of the incident and appears to show an officer punching down towards Mr Qurban as he lies on the ground beside a parked car . Mohaib Qurban was left with horrific injuries following the arrest in Birmingham city centre in March 2012 . CCTV footage shows Mr Qurban being held to the ground beside a parked car as an officer appears to punch down towards him. The footage, obtained by the Birmingham Mail, also shows Mr Qurban lifted into view before the same officer knees him in the head twice. The trainee fork-lift truck driver, of Birmingham, also suffered cuts, a damaged jaw and needed counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr Qurban's initial complaint to West Midlands Police was rejected, but his appeal to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was upheld. The force has now confirmed the officer, who has not been named, is facing a new internal misconduct hearing. The officer will not be prosecuted in court after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to proceed with the case following an IPCC referral. The footage also shows Mr Qurban lifted into view before the same officer knees him in the head twice . Mr Qurban, who lost his job after taking time off to recover from his injuries, is now suing the force for compensation. He said: 'I just want to see justice served. I want the officer to go through what I had to go through. 'I think he should face the courts like I had to face the courts and I think he should lose his job, like I did.' Mr Qurban went on to say: 'I have been very patient and I have gone through all of the official channels, speaking with lawyers, the CPS, the police and the IPCC. 'But this officer is still out there on the streets and nothing seems to be happening. An issue like this just can’t be ignored. Mr Qurban also suffered cuts, a damaged jaw and needed counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder . 'The IPCC upheld my complaint. They also found issues with pocket notes, CS gas and radio transmissions. 'I have no idea why he did it, maybe he just had a bad day, but whatever the reason was, it was not and never would be justifiable.' Mr Qurban had been drinking vodka before his arrest while sitting in the passenger seat of his friend's car in the city's Dean Street. He threw a paper cup from the car, only . for it to be launched back into the vehicle and an officer appeared next . to the window claiming there had been reports of a group acting in a . drunk and disorderly manner. Mr Qurban, who lost his job after taking time off to recover from his injuries, is now suing the force for compensation . Mr Qurban was then pushed against the bonnet of the car and he and his friends were sprayed with CS spray. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: 'The IPCC complaint was upheld, but no criminal charges were brought against the officer. 'The internal force disciplinary procedures are still ongoing.' The IPCC confirmed that they upheld Mr Qurban's complaint and sent the contents of its report to West Midlands Police.","Mohaib Qurban was left with horrific injuries following city centre arrest .

"By . James Rush . These are the squalid conditions a vulnerable pensioner was found in, covered in faeces and surrounded by rubbish, after she was left frightened and alone by her own daughter. Police found Rita Holroyd, 79, from Hartlepool, covered in sores in a single bed after social services raised concerns about her welfare. She was surrounded by cat dirt, litter, half-eaten food and unwashed food containers when she was found by police. Pensioner Rita Holroyd was left to live in squalid conditions by her daughter Christine Holroyd, who has now been sentenced to three months in jail, suspended for a year . The pensioner was found when police broke into the property in Hartlepool after a tip-off from worried neighbours . The pensioner had been left in the bed in the front room of the house by her daughter Christine Holroyd. She was found when police broke into the property in Hartlepool after a tip-off from worried neighbours. Officers had to climb over bags of rubbish to reach the pensioner who had been left a drink in a child's cup but did not have the strength to pick it up. Christine Holroyd, 61, was charged with neglect but magistrates heard that a nurse visited her mother 'two or three weeks' before the police search and had no concerns with the state of the home. Alan Davison, prosecuting, said: 'Rita Holroyd is an elderly lady who lived alone at the time. 'A concerned neighbour contacted social services and police after becoming concerned for her welfare. Rita Holroyd was surrounded by cat dirt, litter, half-eaten food and unwashed food containers when she was found by police . Officers had to climb over bags of rubbish to reach the pensioner who had been left a drink in a child's cup but did not have the strength to pick it up . 'Police gained access to the rear of the property and had to climb over several bags of rubbish to make their way to her. 'She was in a single bed in the front room, lying on her back. 'She was unable to sit up, and was covered in urine and faeces. Her hair was matted with her own faeces. 'The carpets were filthy. There was a child's cup near the bed, but she couldn't physically raise it to her mouth. Christine Holroyd, 61, was charged with neglect but magistrates heard that a nurse visited her mother 'two or three weeks' before the police search and had no concerns with the state of the home . 'She was taken to hospital, once a pathway had been cleared through the rubbish to get her out, and her skin was covered in sores. 'When she was taken into hospital, her hair had to be cut off as it was too matted. The pensioner remained in hospital for two months, and was then admitted into a care home.' Mr Davison added: 'She was seen by a nurse at her home two or three weeks prior to this incident for a vitamin injection, and there were no concerns raised by the nurse at that time. But she was deemed to have no capacity for self-care.' Police found Rita Holroyd, 79, covered in sores in a single bed after social services raised concerns about her welfare . John Relton, defending, said: 'There were no concerns over circumstances in the house when the nurse visited. This was brought to a head when my client's work changed. 'Her mother was very distrusting of third party help and support because of a previous experience when her engagement and wedding rings were stolen from her house. 'My client had her own health problems at the same time, which led to her not seeing the scale of the problem in front of her. 'She has a brother and sister out of town. She should have asked for help. She thought they were coping, but they weren't.' Mr Relton added that the mother and daughter's relationship had not been affected by the lack of care. Chairman of the bench Keith Kitching sentenced Christine Holroyd to three months in jail, suspended for a year, for ill treating or wilfully neglecting a person without capacity. He said: 'We have seen the probation report which is, in parts, quite distressing to read. The lady in question here was left in this condition for a lengthy period of time and she shouldn't have been. 'There is nothing wrong with asking for external help. It is refreshing to hear she is now in residential care.' Holroyd, of Hartlepool, was also ordered to pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge and given a 12-month supervision order.","Police found Rita Holroyd following a tip-off from neighbours in Hartlepool .

"By . James Rush . Police investigating the death of a father-of-two found dead in a chest freezer at home are examining the possibility he may have fallen in and frozen to death. Architect Colin Machin, who was 50, was found dead at his home in Alva, Clackmannanshire, last week, but police do not believe there is a  criminal reason for his death. Instead they are hoping that a post-mortem - expected to be carried out this week - will shed some light on whether Mr Machin froze to death or died of other causes. A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'We have got to keep an open mind about everything now.' Tributes have been paid to father-of-two Colin Machin, right, who was found dead in a freezer at the home he shared with his wife Maria, to his left. Also in the picture are their daughters Sinead, left, and Erin, right . Mr Machin was found at his home in Alva, Clackmannanshire, last week . Dundee University Graduate Mr Machin, who ran architecture firms Machin, Dunn and Macfarlane and Machin Associates, and ran Boll Holiday Cottages with his wife, Maria, 51, was a popular figure locally. Friends and family have now paid tribute to the architect, who leaves daughters Sinead, 23, and Erin, 21, online. Mr Machin's younger daughter Erin changed her profile picture on Facebook to a photo of her and her father, and posted lyrics from the song Caledonia, saying: 'Let me tell you that I love you. And I think about you all the time.' Friend Kevin Hogg wrote: 'Such a great guy with a huge heart. Such a privilege having being a friend, so sad to have have lost a great friend.' Margaret Paterson added: 'There are not enough words to say how sad Jock and I are to hear about Colin. 'A wonderful person and loyal friend whom I will miss very much. My love to you all.' Police are treating the death as 'unexplained'. It is understood officers are working on a theory that no crime was involved in his death . Another friend wrote: 'I did not want to believe what I was hearing, just heartbroken for you all. 'Colin will be so missed by everyone who knew him.' Pauline Fisher told Erin: 'So so sorry to hear about your dad. He was a great friend and so much fun to be around. We will miss him. All our love to you.'","Colin Machin was found in the freezer at his home in Alva, Clackmannanshire .

"By . James Rush . These revealing images show what life is like on the inside of Brazil's overcrowded jails where football hooligans could find themselves if they cause trouble during the World Cup. Italian photographer Giuseppe Bizzarri was given rare access to Sao Paulo's most infamous penitentiaries where football fans could be sent if violence erupts during the tournament. The photographer, who described the jails as 'crime universities', said criminal firm First Capital Command (FCC) control drugs and gun traffic in Sao Paulo, where England take on Uruguay in their second group fixture. Crowded: Italian photographer Giuseppe Bizzarri has been given rare access to Sao Paulo's most infamous penitentiaries where football fans could be sent if violence erupts during the World Cup . Insight: The revealing images offer an insight into the packed prison cells, where football fans could find themselves if they cause trouble during the tournament . Conditions: Single beds sleep up to five people in the over-crowded prisons in Sao Paulo which Mr Bizzarri described as 'crime universities', adding criminal organisations 'send the plans to the individuals who are outside' The photographer, who has lived in Brazil for 20 years, said: 'Brazilian prisons are like a crime university. 'The main criminal organisations connected to traffic organise themselves and then send their plans to the individuals who are outside. 'I think everyone knows it's awful the way they treat inmates. The reality inside Brazilian penitentiaries changed a lot ever since FCC has the power inside jails in the state of Sao Paulo, where most of the inmate Brazilian population is. 'It is not a coincidence the fact that FCC was born right after the bloody riot of Carandiru where almost all of the inmates in pavilion nine were massacred by the military police. 'FCC is a criminal organisation which has a great support in and outside prisons and it has an influence in the political world and the town halls. 'The FCC has already arranged two riots in prisons in the state of Sao Paulo, where they repeatedly attacked police quarters, banks and other buildings, with a strategic purpose.' Organisations: Mr Bizzarri said criminal firm First Capital Command (FCC) control drugs and gun traffic in Sao Paulo, where England take on Uruguay in their second group fixture . The photographer said the FCC was born after a prison riot in 1992 at the former Carandiro penitentiary, in Sao Paulo, in which more than 100 inmates were killed .

Roy Hodgson's men play their third and final group fixture against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on June 24 where Mr Bizzarri said fans can expect a frosty reception. Mr Bizzarri added: 'The UN already raised awareness to the prison conditions in Brazil. 'The biggest problem still is the overpopulation of prisons. Inmates usually have families and they leave their kids with nothing so wives end up getting in on the crimes as well because they don't know what to do.

Overpopulation: Mr Bizzarri said the biggest problem facing the inmates was 'the overpopulation of prisons' 'That led to the rise in construction of prisons for women, the majority of which are arrested for drug trafficking. 'One of the most transmitted diseases is tuberculosis which spreads rapidly because of the overpopulation. 'Tuberculosis also spreads outside prisons mainly because most times the inmate does not know he is infected when he comes out. 'These prisons really are brutal and no-one in their right mind would want to end up there.' Problems: According to the photographer, tuberculosis is one of the most transmitted diseases in the prisons, which spreads rapidly because of the overpopulation . Mr Bizzarri said: 'These prisons really are brutal and no-one in their right mind would want to end up there' Mr Bizzarri said the FCC had already arranged two riots in prisons in the state of Sao Paulo, 'where they repeatedly attacked police quarters, banks and other buildings' 'Awful': Photographer Mr Bizzarri has lived in Brazil for 20 years and said: 'I think everyone knows it's awful the way they treat inmates' A prison riot in October 1992 led to military police storming the former Carandiru penitentiary, Sao Paulo, in what emerged to be one of the bloodiest massacres in Brazillian history. More than 100 inmates died in the massacre, with 102 being gunned down by police and a further nine being killed by fellow inmates. Twenty-three policemen involved in the massacre were jailed for 156 years each for the killing of 13 prisoners while 25 others 624 years each for the deaths of 52 inmates.

A picture of Sir Peter in women’s clothing with his arm around a female colleague was tweeted by Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan who joked: 'Just stumbled across this couple backstage! The one in the hat looks strangely familiar!' The event was organised by the Senior Women in Policing group whose female members include women police officers of the rank superintendent and above. Drinks were served to senior women police officers by topless male waiters at the New Century House office building. In a statement today, Sir Peter said: 'I know it is not usual for me to wear a dress but this was for a charity very dear to my heart, the Christie hospital.

'Just over the last month or so we . have lost two colleagues in GMP to cancer and we have a number of other . staff members currently bravely battling the disease, some with a . terminal prognosis. Sir Peter joined the police in 1981, and is currently the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on workforce development. He was Assistant Chief Constable at Surrey, and had positions with Hertfordshire and West Midlands forces before joining Cheshire Constabulary as Chief Constable in 2002. There he called for the legal age limit for buying alcohol to be raised to 21 following the death of father of four Garry Newlove, 48, at the hands of drunken yobs in 2007. Sir Peter took up his post at GMP on September 1, 2008, following the death of Michael Todd who was found dead in Snowdonia. He has been critical of red tape which has been creeping into police forces across the United Kingdom. He was knighted in 2012. 'I am angry at the toll it is taking and the letters I am having to write to bereaved families. 'We are losing so many good people month by month across Greater Manchester but the Christie and other cancer charities are doing so much good work to try and turn the tide.' Greater Manchester Police said: 'Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy modelled a range of outfits including a flowery summer dress for a charity fashion show organised by GMP’s Women in Policing Group on Saturday 7 June. 'He also wore a more conventional flying jacket and T-shirt.' Sir Peter has received support from police officers across the country after taking part in the charity fashion show. The Northumbria Police Federation tweeted: '#Amazing work as chief constable Sir Peter Fahy squeezes into a dress for a great cause'. The Greater Manchester Police Federation meanwhile tweeted: 'Well done Sir Peter Fahy for helping to raise money for a fantastic cause.' The force said later this month a group of GMP staff will be cycling to London to raise money for The Christie and the force is planning a number of other fundraising events. The event has so far raised £3,500 for The Christie. Last year Sir Peter showed his sense of humour after he agreed to be filmed doing the Gangnam-style for a charity video. He agreed to put on a pair of sunglasses and dance like Korean singer Psy in front of a police station to help raise money for a young boy diagnosed with a brain tumour.","Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy pictured in women's clothing at charity show .
