"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 3:06 PM on 19th October 2011 . After Britain's top female skier Chemmy Alcott crashed during training at 80mph she feared she might never walk again. She had broken her right leg in two places with such force that the bones had pierced through the skin. Now less than a year later, the glamour girl of the slopes is back on her feet and determined to restart her skiing career in April. 'I will need to get new boots fitted in Austria because I essentially have a new right leg,' the Surrey girl told MailOnline. 'Then once I'm skiing again I will need to deal with the mental aspects of my accident. Up till now I've just focused on physical healing.' Flying high: Chemmy Alcott was an Olympic contender before a split-second error left her with a shattered leg . Blur: Chemmy has a patchy memory of the accident . Chemmy knows that the psychological scars are likely to be deep. She still doesn't have a full memory of her horrific accident. The last thing she remembers of the event that would change her life was surprisingly thinking about underwear. 'I was up at the start gate and trying to stay in a relaxed mood,' the 29-year-old recalls. 'And . I realised that the Italian girl in front of me was wearing a thong as I . could clearly see the outline. It made me laugh. Then my memory is a . total blank.' It was December 2010 and Britain's . top female alpine skier was doing her last training run at Lake Louise . in Canada. The blonde bombshell was on track for another successful ski season. But what happened next - and what Chemmy doesn't remember - is that one false move during a jump meant she smashed into the slope with such impact that it shattered her right leg. 'The next thing I remember is being angry with myself for making such a stupid error and beating the slope with my fist,' the skier said. 'Then I remember realising that my leg felt wet.' Chemmy had broken her right tibia and fibula and the wet sensation was blood seeping out from where the bones poked through her skin. But despite feeling intense fear as she was airlifted off the slope and taken to a hospital in nearby Banff she tried to appear positive. 'I was in a lot of pain but I kept telling everyone ""I'm fine, I'm so sorry for causing such a fuss"" but then I realised how serious it was from how everyone was reacting,' she told MailOnline. Following the operation Chemmy, who had finished 11th in the 2010 Winter Olympics, was told she had been fitted with a 20cm-long metal plate fixed with 10 screws. She wouldn't ski again for months - if at all. Back on her feet: Chemmy is now training for hours every day to get herself back into peak physical condition . Help: Chemmy used a Compex device to get her muscles working and wore a protective cage to protect it . But she managed to hold depression at bay thanks to the Canadian professional skiers who visited her every day. 'They made sure I was never alone to think dark thoughts even though they were competing,' she said. 'My friend, the U.S. skier Julia Mancuso virtually slept at the hospital.' After a few weeks in hospital Chemmy was flown back to the UK and she was back on a rowing machine with her leg in the air within a fortnight. 'I didn't want to end my career on a crash and despite the accident I still loved skiing and didn't shy away from winter sports,' she said. But then she found out from a visiting TV crew that UK sport had ended all funding for skiing and snowboarding and were diverting the money to curling and bobsleigh instead. 'I couldn't help it, I just started crying,' she said. 'I feared my dreams to get back on my feet were over.' But the resulting news item triggered a surge of support for the plucky sportswoman. 'I realised that even if UK sport didn't have faith in me, lots of individuals did,' she said. 'Since my mother died I have vowed to seize each day, so I knew I had to see the crash as an opportunity.' Chemmy, whose wound is pictured above,  was the first British woman to qualify for the World Cup Finals, . the first British skier to win a run in a World Cup race and the first . British skier to win the British Land National Ski Championships six . times in a row. She competed in three consecutive Olympic Games, in Salt Lake City in 2002, Turin and . then Vancouver. In 2006 and 2010 she finished in an impressive . 11th place. She . hasn't skied since she broke her leg in two places. So with help from the founders of the fitness club The Third Space, Ms Alcott started training again. 'We knew that we had to let my leg rest but that meant we could spend time working on other elements of my body,' she said. 'I . broke my back when I was 18 and when we watched videos of my races we . realised it meant I wasn't croaching as low as I could when going . downhill. So my personal trainer came up with exercises to make my spine . more flexible.' Chemmy also used Compex pads to stimulate the muscles in her right leg to stop them wasting away and slept with her leg in a mini ice-chamber to try and numb the pain. By March this year Chemmy was able to stand on two feet again but she was still suffering. 'I know the pain is not something that will ever completely leave me,' she said. 'But I've been reading the autobiography of Hermann Maier - a world class skier who came back from a motorcycle accident. I find it really useful how he talks about coming to terms with the pain.' Despite her long ordeal, Chemmy refuses to feel sorry for herself. 'To be the best in the world you have to be prepared to go to the limit,' she said. 'Injury comes with the territory. It's one of the risks you take.' Goal: Chemmy said she wants to take part in competitive skiing again . Chemmy Alcott has been pictured at Slough iceskating rink. She is rumoured to be appearing in Dancing on Ice this February . Now she spends 10 hours in the gym twice a week and exercises from home and swims on the other days. Outlining her Third Space routine she explained: 'I work out with a personal trainer in the morning, . then it's an hours of physio followed by gyratonics (a type of pilates), . aerobics and a painful leg massage in the afternoon.' All of which means she is confident of getting back on the slopes early next year with a view to re-starting her skiing career in April. It is likely that she is also focusing on a certain ITV reality show, due to skate its way back on our screens in February 2012. However, Chemmy won't be drawn on whether she will be taking part in the next series of Dancing on Ice, just confirming it's a 'rumour' she's aware of. Either way, her long-term goal is to compete in the 2014 in Sochi, Russia. 'There is a chance that I might not be as fast as I used to be,' she said. 'But I've just got to try.' Chemmy Alcott will be demonstrating Compex and signing autographs at the Ski and Snowboard Show on at London Earl's Court from 19-23 October .","Last thing Chemmy remembers before crash is realising skier in front of her was wearing a thong .

"By . Lucy Laing . Last updated at 6:27 PM on 6th January 2012 . Miss Fish was applying the tanning product ahead of a weekend night out when she felt a lump in the side of her neck . When Kathryn Fish applied her fake tan, she had never expected it to save her life. Miss Fish was applying the tanning product ahead of a weekend night out when she felt a lump in the side of her neck. She went to the doctors and then was referred to hospital for a biopsy, and she received the devastating news that she had cancer. She now credits the fake tan with saving her life - as it allowed her to discover the cancerous lump in time to get it treated. Miss Fish, 21, a call centre operator, said: ‘My usual beauty routine involved applying fake tan before a night out. ‘I was rubbing it into my neck when I felt a hard lump on the side of my neck. I knew straight away that something was wrong. ‘I’m just glad I found it when I was applying my tanning lotion as if I hadn’t spotted it then, it could have had such a different outcome and I may not have survived.’ Miss Fish, whose partner Nick Green, 24, is a supermarket team leader, was suffering from tiredness and exhaustion in July last year, but put it down to a student lifestyle. She said: ‘I was studying at the time and I was living a typical student lifestyle. I would fall asleep in the daytime and I thought that was normal as I was having late nights. ‘But looking back, it wasn’t normal for a young person to be as tired as I was.’ A few weeks later she was applying the tanning lotion to her body in preparation for a night out with her friends when she felt the lump. Miss Fish, who lives in Cardiff, said: ‘I felt the lump on my neck and I showed it to my friends. They agreed it was unusual. ‘I put it to the back of my mind, thinking that it would just go away, but after three weeks it was still there so I went to see the doctor. The doctor referred her for a biopsy at hospital and then the following week she had a CT scan.She said: ‘I had to wait two weeks for the results so I went to Bulgaria on holiday with my friends. I never imagined it would be anything really serious.’ But doctors broke the devastating news to her that she had Hodgkins Lymphoma, a cancer of the blood. She . said: ‘My parents came with me for the results and when he told us what . it was, we all just looked at each other and I burst into tears. My . world just fell apart, I couldn’t believe that I had cancer. Doctors broke the devastating news to Kathryn that she had Hodgkins Lymphoma, a cancer of the blood . Kathryn, whose partner Nick Green, was suffering from tiredness and exhaustion in July last year, but put it down to a student lifestyle . Miss Fish started on chemotherapy treatment in August 2010 at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, which finished in January last year, which left her feeling sick and exhausted. She said: ‘The chemotherapy was extremely draining and I felt sick and exhausted with it. I lost my hair too, but I was determined to beat this disease. I had so much I still wanted to do with my life - I wanted to travel the world, get a job and see my 21st birthday. I didn’t want to die young and that kept me fighting.’ Luckily the treatment has worked and she is now in remission, although she has to return to hospital every three months for a check up. She said: ‘I just feel very lucky to still be alive, having beaten this disease. And it was my fake tan that saved my life. I’m very fussy with my fake tan and always make sure its rubbed in really well so that it doesn’t streak. And its that which has saved my life. ‘If I hadn’t been rubbing the lotion into my neck I wouldn’t have spotted the lump until later, and by then it could have been too late for me. ‘Because it was caught so early, I managed to get treated in time. Not only does fake tan save lives from skin cancer, but it has saved mine too from a different type of cancer.’ Miss Fish is now campaigning with the Lymphoma Association to raise the awareness of symptoms of Hodgkins Lymphoma, which includes excessive sweating, persister lumps, itching and tiredness. She added: ‘People shouldn’t ignore lumps that don’t go away. And people need to realise that its not just breast cancer we should be checking for, but for lumps in your neck, armpit and groin too.’","Kathryn felt lump when applying beauty product .

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 3:40 AM on 7th January 2012 . A young mother returned home with her baby boy yesterday just 13 days after a nightmare labour which put her into a coma. Fiona Moore had two heart attacks and lost 14 pints of blood while giving birth to her second child. During the delivery, she fell into a coma which lasted two days, while 30 doctors and midwives battled to save both her life and that of her baby. Home sweet home: Fiona Moore nearly died while giving birth to baby Wesley. She suffered two heart attacks and lost 14 pints of blood . The 25-year-old suffered an amniotic embolism - which affects just 1 in 10,000 births - when fluid from her womb leaked into her body. The embolism triggered two heart attacks in quick succession and caused massive haemorraghing of her womb. Surgeons delivered Miss Moore's son, Wesley Hitchman, by emergency caesarean while doctors battled to restart her heart when it stopped beating. Now, less than two weeks after her ordeal, the young mother is back home in Wood End, Coventry, with her partner Wayne Hitchman, 28. Miss Moore said: 'One doctor sat at the end of my hospital bed and told me I really gave everyone a fright. 'As she was telling me about what happened she started to cry and I began crying too. 'I can't thank the doctors and midwives enough. They didn't just save my life, they saved my baby too.' All together again: Fiona with her partner Wayne Hitchman, and sons Travis and Wesley . Miss Moore, who also has a two-and-a-half-year-old son Travis, went into University Hospital Coventry on December 21 to be induced. Initially everything went as planned but at 5am the next day her heart stopped. Her partner Wayne said: 'Fiona was struggling to breath so we helped her sit up, but her whole face started turning blue. 'They called the emergency team who began CPR. I heard one of the midwives say ""she's not breathing"". I started to break down. Miracle baby: Wesley's birth is even more astonishing because Miss Moore was initially told by doctors she would not be able to have children . 'There must have been 30 people in that . room working to save her.' Miss Moore was rushed into surgery and within . 20 minutes doctors delivered her healthy baby son Wesley. He was taken to the special care unit as a precaution while surgeons battled to stop her massive internal bleeding. She lost 14 pints of blood and lay in a coma for two days before waking up on Christmas Eve. Wesley's birth is even more astonishing after Miss Moore was initially told by doctors she would not be able to have children. But she defied the odds when she got pregnant with her first son Travis in 2008. However she also suffered complications during his birth, after his shoulder got stuck and his umbilical cord became wrapped around his neck. Miss Moore said: 'The doctors can't believe how well we're both doing. I don't remember anything, I lost a week of my life. 'It was my family, the doctors and the midwives who really went through everything - it must have felt like months to them. 'When something goes wrong you fear the worst. But this shows miracles really do happen at Christmas.' Consultant obstetrician Professor Siobhan Quenby, who treated Miss Moore, said: 'It was a fantastic team effort - I don't think there were many people in the hospital that night who weren't involved. 'For two days we weren't sure she was going to make it. 'It was quite emotional. Nobody wanted this beautiful baby to be left without a mother.'",Team of 30 medics battled to save Fiona Moore as she lay in coma for two days .
"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 8:51 PM on 9th January 2012 . Tragic: Logan Kushner died after smoking K2 synthetic marijuana before jumping into a creek . A promising college American football player drowned after smoking K2 synthetic marijuana and jumping in a creek. Logan Matthew Kushner had bought K2 with a friend legally from a neighbourhood gas station before smoking the synthetic product and jumping into a park creek early on Sunday morning in Clearwater, Florida. According to reports, Kushner's friend whom police did not name, persuaded the 19-year-old to get out of the water and told him they needed to leave. But when Kushner opted to stay, the friend left him behind at the park. The . Palm Harbor University High School student, who also played football . for the school's team, The Hurricanes, did not answer calls to his phone . after being left alone. After failing to contact him, Kushner's friends went to the creek and found him unresponsive in the water, according to police. He was pronounced dead at Mease Countryside Hospital. Kushner had been smoking K2, which is branded as an incense but also called 'fake weed'. K2 . and similar substances are known to be synthetic cannabinoids . significantly more powerful than marijuana, according to the Drug . Enforcement Administration. Dangerous effects: The number of people falling ill after taking synthetic drugs like K2 and Ivory Wave has rocketed in the the last year . Normally sold by the gram in brightly-coloured packaging, the substances are known to induce dizziness and hallucinations. Users can also experience paranoia, anxiety and agitation, as well as physical side-effects such as high blood pressure and heart rate, panic attacks and seizures. Laboratory-made drugs have been around since the middle of the 20th century, when LSD was first studied. But synthetic marijuana - produced by spraying dried plant material with a chemical compound - has only been around for the last few years. Effects include paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, seizures and a rapid heartbeat and symptoms can last for days. Doctors usually treat overdoses with anti-anxiety drugs like Valium and Xanax which slow the heart rate. One patient told a doctor at the Carolinas Poison Center it was 'like being on cocaine, but ten times worse'. When friends found Kushner, he was discovered unresponsive in the water. He has since been remembered as a 'popular kid with a good heart', while devastated school friends have set up a Facebook tribute page and organised a vigil. Andrea Weaver, 40, his 10th grade English teacher, said: 'He was upbeat. He always had a smile.' Police have yet to reveal what caused Kushner to drown, or whether he was under the influence of any other substance at the time of his death. Fake forms of marijuana were sold . online and in drug paraphernalia shops and convenience stores until the . DEA banned the use and sale of their key ingredients in March. Shortly . after the ban, however, various manufacturers began advertising other . fake marijuana products, many of which are sold online. According to the Tampa Bay Times, a gas station near Clearwater was selling a substance called Scooby Snax Potpourri on Sunday. Despite its name, the product warned it was not meant for human consumption. The company's website asserted that the product does not contain any of the compounds banned under synthetic cannabinoids legislation.",Logan Matthew Kushner smoked synthetic marijuana shortly before death .
"By . Tamara Cohen . Last updated at 7:56 AM on 4th January 2012 . End of the hearing aid? Scientists have discovered a gene which could hold the key to reversing deafness . Scientists have found a single gene they believe could hold the key to age-related deafness. The breakthrough brings the prospect of a treatment to prevent hearing loss, which affects half of people over 60, a step closer. When the FGF20 gene was taken out in mice, the animals appeared perfectly healthy, but could not hear at all. The researchers, at Washington University School of Medicine, found two-thirds of their outer hair cells, the delicate cells in the inner ear which amplify sounds, had disappeared. Damage to these cells is associated with the most hearing loss related to old age, noise exposure and some genetic conditions. The study suggests this gene – which is also found in humans – could be critical to attempts to growing new hair cells, considered the holy grail of those researching treatments for deafness. Because our bodies have no way of replacing these cells, there is currently no cure although hearing aids can provide some relief. However gradual age-related hearing loss still leaves sufferers socially isolated and many take several years to seek help. The researchers ‘knocked out’ the gene in mice by removing a protein which causes it to develop while they are in the womb. It is one of a number of genes – called fibroblast growth factors – which are crucial in tissue development and wound healing in embryos. But removing it at this early stage did not seem to cause any other adverse effects. Researchers found that when the FGF20 gene was removed from mice, the animals appeared perfectly healthy, but could not hear at all (file picture) In particular, the inner hair cells, which electrically transmit the amplified sounds to the brain, appeared normal. Lead author Dr Sung-Ho Huh said: ‘This is the first evidence that inner and outer hair cells develop independently of one another. 'This is important because most age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss is due to the loss of outer hair cells.’ The next step is to see whether deafness in human is associated with mutations of the same gene, which is already underway. Hope? Age-related hearing loss can leave sufferers socially isolated, with many taking several years to seek help (picture posed by model) Professor Karen Steel, an expert in the genetics of deafness at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said: ‘The scientific community is very, very interested in developing a way of triggering regeneration of hair cells. ‘They never regenerate once they die, and so there’s a lot of work going on to understand how we can get over that problem, and try to regenerate the hearing. ‘What this study suggests is that FGF20 could be critical for the development of that hair cell, as part of a cocktail of other molecules. ‘I would say regenerating hair cells in humans is between 10 and 20 years away. It's a very complicated problem as there are so many genes potentially involved, it’s like a 1,000-piece puzzle, but this brings us a bit closer.’ Rachel Baker of Action on Hearing Loss said: ‘Understanding how cells in the inner ear grow is crucial in developing new therapies for protecting and restoring hearing. ‘We are pleased to be funding a new project being run by this research team, which is further investigating the role of FGF20 in hearing. 'In the future, this could lead to studies to test whether reactivation of FGF20 can regenerate damaged parts of the inner ear.’ The study is published today in the journal PLoS Biology.","Extracting FGF20 gene from mice prevented cells which amplify sounds from developing .

"Jaymie Adams missing since December 10 . Husband revealed she went to meet clients night she disappeared . Body found on Saturday but thought to have been there for one day . By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 4:38 PM on 9th January 2012 . The body of the missing pregnant mother who was later revealed to be a Craigslist prostitute has been found on a dirt bike track and her husband and mother-in-law's cars have been seized . Jaymie Adams, 25, from Blanchard, Oklahoma, was reported missing on December 10 and was said to be pregnant with her fifth child. When her body was found on Saturday by a motorcyclist using a dirt bike track near Lake Stanley Draper, police believed it had only been there for one day. Investigation: The body of Jaymie Adams was found on Saturday on a dirt bike track and police believe it may have been there for a day . Yesterday they impounded the cars of her husband Justin, who only revealed two weeks after she went missing that she went to meet two clients after initially saying she was meeting a friend. Oklahoma City police Captain Lisa . Camacho told NewsOk that police have finished processing the site where the mother-of-four's body was found. She said police then impounded the cars of Adams' husband, Justin Adams, and his mother, Tina Clark, and are simply looking for evidence in the vehicles. Though she said they have not named any suspects at this time, Adams' attorney told NewsOK they told his client at the time of his arrest that he was a suspect. She said: 'At the time, my client was told he . and his mother were suspects. When he attempted to get items out of the car they said no. 'He told that this is what they said to him that you're a suspect and you can't touch the car or get anything out of the car.' He said he had plans to meet . with Justin Adams and Tina Clark on Sunday evening and was not surprised they were suspects. He told News Channel4: 'By innuendos, when they questioned him the time they were grilling him it was like he was a suspect. 'And you know he would have to be not very intelligent if he didn't believe that they were trying to make him a suspect the first time they interrogated him.' Suspicious disappearance: The mother-of-four was said to have advertised as a 'massage therapist' on Craigslist but was actually a hooker . Husband: Justin Adams, 25, changed his story and told police he and his wife had advertised on Craigslist as 'swingers' When police initially interviewed Adams in the days after his wife disappeared, he failed to mention . that he and his wife were 'swingers' or that she advertised on . Craigslist as a 'massage therapist' but had actually been 'meeting with . strangers' for sex. He then revealed that his wife went to meet a 'client' at a motel in Norman the night she disappeared. Investigators discovered Mrs Adams' social security card and the couple's marriage license in a bedroom . drawer at their home. A red purse containing several sex toys was also . recovered. Adams was the last . person to see his wife alive after she left their trailer park home to meet a 'friend' at a . McDonald's. He told police at the time she had called from . the fast-food joint saying her 'friend' had not shown up - but that was . the last he heard from her. He denied . knowing who she was meeting. The 25-year-old's car was found in the McDonald's parking lot and was seized for investigation. Justin and Jaymie Adams have been married since February and have a four-month-old child together. Last seen: She told her husband she was going to meet a 'friend' at this McDonalds at 11pm and police found her van here . Online: Police haven't officially named any suspects in the case or said if she was murdered . In the days after she went missing, Mr Adams made an emotional TV appeal, urging the public to help bring his wife home safely. He said: 'She deserves to be at home with her family, our children need their mother. 'My wife is a loving a strong woman. She's an amazing mom, and amazing wife, we have three sons and she's 2-month pregnant this week. 'I'm begging that if anyone has any information about my wife or her whereabouts, call OKCPD.'","Jaymie Adams missing since December 10 .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Last updated at 1:42 AM on 2nd December 2011 . The former head of the International Monetary Fund believes his ‘uninhibited’ sex life cost him his chance to become president of France. Dominique Strauss-Kahn denies paying to sleep with prostitutes but admits attending ‘sex parties’ in a biography released yesterday that explores the allegations of attempted rape that effectively ended his political career. The 62-year-old, who admits that his ‘flesh is weak’, says he deeply regrets his sexual encounter with a maid at the Sofitel hotel in New York, which led to his arrest on May 14. Happily married: Strauss-Kahn lives in Paris with his third wife, Anne Sinclair (pictured), who has stuck with him throughout the recent scandals . ‘Nothing would have happened if I . hadn’t had this consensual, but stupid, relationship with Nafissatou . Diallo,’ said Mr Strauss-Kahn, referring to the 32-year-old Guinean who . claimed to have been attacked. ‘That day, I opened the door to all the  other affairs.’ Hotel maid: Nafissatou Diallo, accused DSK of sexually attacking her in New York . Prosecutors eventually dropped all criminal charges in August, but Miss Diallo has pursued a civil case. The Frenchman was also investigated . over the attempted rape of writer Tristane Banon, now 32, in 2001. In . October, prosecutors said there was clear evidence that Mr Strauss-Kahn . had sexually assaulted Miss Banon, but it had been too long ago for . legal action to be taken. Mr Strauss-Kahn, who was the . favourite Socialist candidate to defeat Nicolas Sarkozy in France’s . elections next year, says: ‘I could have been in a position to be . president. Now, I’m no longer in that position, that’s all.’ Mr Strauss-Kahn admits to an . ‘uninhibited sex life’, but says this is not ‘illegal’ nor ‘unusual’, . especially in France, where politicians are notoriously promiscuous. Biographer Michel Taubmann also uses . DSK’s Affairs – The Counter Enquiry to explore fresh accusations that Mr . Strauss-Kahn was involved in an illegal prostitution racket based at . the Carlton hotel in Lille, northern France. Responding to claims that he . regularly attended orgies in France and the U.S., Mr Strauss-Kahn said: . ‘In the Press, they link my name to prostitution. ‘It’s unbearable. I did go to sex parties, it’s true, but usually those who came to these events were not prostitutes.’ He adds: ‘I have a horror of prostitution and pimping. Can you imagine the damage caused to my wife, our children?’ Arrested: Dominique Strauss-Kahn, center, being taken into the Municipal Court on May 16 in New York after the alleged attack . Alleged crime scene: This is the view of the door to DSK's presidential suite he stayed in in New York's Sofitel Hotel, where he received oral sex from the hotel maid . Mr Strauss-Kahn said he was keen to . meet prosecutors so he could clear his name of ‘dangerous and malicious . insinuations’ connected to the Carlton Affair. More accusations: DSK was also investigated over the alleged attempted rape of writer Tristane Banon (pictured) in 2001 . The book also touches on recent claims that Mr Strauss-Kahn was ‘set up’ in New York by his political opponents. His biographer refers to ‘the French . secret service’ knowing what was going on, and suggests that Mr . Strauss-Kahn’s BlackBerry – which was thought to have been hacked . before  going missing – could have been stolen by Miss Diallo and a . ‘mystery’ second man. The conspiracy theory surfaced over . the weekend in an investigative report by U.S. journalist Edward Epstein . based on information provided by Mr Strauss-Kahn’s defence lawyers. It was dismissed by Mr Sarkozy’s ruling UMP party as nothing more than ‘an obvious manipulation’. Before the Sofitel incident, Mr . Strauss-Kahn had been warned by a French diplomat friend that an effort . would be made to embarrass him with a scandal. However, Mr Taubmann . confirms that Mr Strauss-Kahn could not ‘resist the temptation’. Mr Strauss-Kahn claims Miss Diallo ‘gazed’ at his naked body when he came out of the shower – and he saw this as a proposition. Accordingly he ‘agreed’ to  allow her . to perform a sex act,  even though Miss Diallo was in fact  plotting to . steal his BlackBerry, he alleges. Lawyers for Miss Diallo attacked the book as ‘complete fantasy’. Mr Strauss-Kahn is currently living . in Paris with his third  wife, former TV presenter Anne Sinclair, who . has supported him throughout the recent scandals.","DSK insists he never paid for sex at any of the orgies he attended .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 5:02 PM on 9th January 2012 . The Obama administration is moving forward with a controversial plan to ban new uranium mining claims on 1 million acres near the Grand Canyon. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is today expected to finalise a 20-year ban on new mining claims on public land surrounding the canyon in Arizona. The White House believes uranium is still an important part of energy strategy but the Grand Canyon is a national treasure to be protected. Tourist hotspot: The Grand Canyon attracts more than 4 million visitors a year and generates an estimated $3.5billion in economic activity . Mr Salazar has twice imposed temporary bans on new uranium claims and has fended off pressure from the mining industry and Republicans. The Grand Canyon attracts more than 4 million visitors a year and generates an estimated $3.5billion in economic activity, Mr Salazar said. Millions of Americans living in cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, and Los Angeles, California, rely on the Colorado River for clean drinking water. ‘Like our ancestors, we do not know how future Americans will enjoy, experience and benefit from this place,’ Mr Salazar said in June. ‘And that's one of the many reasons why wisdom, caution and science should guide our protection of the Grand Canyon.’ Plan: Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is expected to finalise a 20-year ban on new mining claims on public land surrounding the Grand Canyon in Arizona . He said it was appropriate to identify what impact mining would have on the canyon and decide what level of risk is acceptable. 'Like our ancestors, we do not know how future Americans will enjoy, experience and benefit from this place' Ken Salazar . Conservation groups call the ban a crucial protection for a U.S. icon. But . the mining industry and some congressional Republican say it’s . detrimental to Arizona's economy and the nation's energy independence. Mr Salazar is expected to talk about his conservation plans at the National Geographic Museum in Washington D.C. on Monday. Republican members of Arizona's congressional delegation have lambasted temporary bans imposed by Mr Salazar in 2009 and 2010. Important: Millions of Americans living in cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, and Los Angeles, California, rely on the Colorado River, pictured, for clean drinking water . A permanent ban on filing new claims would eliminate hundreds of jobs and unravel decades of responsible resource development, they say. 'Despite significant pressure from the mining industry, the President and Secretary Salazar did not back down' Pew Environment Group . Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake and other GOP lawmakers are backing legislation to prevent Mr Salazar from moving forward with the ban. Environmental groups say the Colorado . River, which runs through the Grand Canyon, is the source of drinking . water for 26 million Americans. Advocacy organisation the Environmental Working Group praised Mr Salazar for defending ‘the Southwest's right to plentiful, clean water’. ‘Despite significant pressure from the mining industry, the President and Secretary Salazar did not back down,’ Pew Environment Group said. Uranium mine: The mining industry and some congressional Republican say the ban is detrimental to the nation's energy independence (file picture) As outlined in October, the ban would not affect more than 3,000 mining claims already staked in the area near the Grand Canyon. 'Secretary Salazar has defended the Southwest's right to plentiful, clean water and America's dedication to one of our most precious landscapes' Environmental Working Group . The Bush administration had opened up the land to new mining claims - but Mr Salazar reversed the Bush policy in 2009. He called for a two-year moratorium on new mining claims around the canyon and followed up with a six-month extension last year. Backers say any increase in jobs is not worth risks to the Colorado River, lands seen as sacred by American Indian tribes or wildlife habitat. A mining mishap could also be disastrous for tourism in the area.","Interior Secretary Ken Salazar finalising 20-year ban .

Pablo Picasso's 1939 Woman's Head and Dutch painter Piet Mondrian's Mill were taken in the dawn raid at Athens' National Art Gallery. They also took a sketch by Italian painter Guglielmo Caccia, donated to the gallery in 1907. Stolen: Pablo Picasso's Women's Head (left) and Guglielmo Caccia's sketch (right) were both taken from the National Art Gallery in Athens . Taken: Piet Mondrian's oil painting Mill was also stolen in the early morning raid . The value of the pieces have not been revealed. But the Picasso, given to the Greeks by the artist himself in 1949, is thought to be worth at least several hundred thousands pounds. Mondrian's 1905 painting Landscape was dropped on the floor as the thieves made their getaway, police said. The burglars entered through a balcony door. They had intentionally set off alarms on several occasions, at 4.30am, without actually entering the building, prompting guards to disable at least one. The burglars still triggered a sensor in the exhibition area, but a guard only got there in time to see a man running off. Crime scene: Greek police collect evidence next to a broken door outside the National Gallery . An official said: 'After the alarm went off the guard discovered that the two paintings were missing. Another was lying on the floor. 'It all happened in seven minutes'. Police are still investigating if any other art is missing. Picasso had donated the cubist female bust 'in homage to the Greek people' for their resistance to Nazi occupiers during World War II. The National Gallery's collection also includes a Mondrian drawing entitled the Study of Flower. In October, police in Serbia recovered two paintings by Picasso stolen in 2008 from a gallery in Switzerland and worth millions of dollars. Warning: Museum bosses said the alarm went off just after 5am but the thieves escaped undetected . In September Greece recovered a painting by Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens stolen from a museum in Belgium in 2001 and arrested two Greeks who tried to sell it to undercover police for about one million euros. And only last week the £2.75 million René Magritte painting Olympia, which was stolen at gunpoint from a Brussels museum two years ago, was handed back. The thieves decided to cut their losses after it failed to sell on the black market.",Sketch by Italian painter Caccia also taken .

A BBC documentary about teenage sex which follows a girl hoping to lose her virginity has been branded a 'freak show'. The hour-long programme, which . includes the F-word and discussions about oral sex and sex aids, is due . to be screened on BBC3 on Thursday. But the Corporation is under pressure not to screen Cherry Healey: Like A Virgin, which is scheduled to go out immediately after the 9pm watershed. 'The show is ­terrible, almost a freak show,' Vivienne Pattison, of TV watchdog Mediawatch, told the Sunday Express. 'It’s also irresponsible, inappropriate, disturbing and even exploitative towards some of those featured in it. 'For a programme clearly aimed at a teenage audience it is extremely irresponsible not to include any ­discussion of safe sex.' Mediawatch believes there is a danger the Ofcom code could be flouted by using material harmful to the 'moral development' of under 18-year-olds. Former minister Ann Widdecombe has joined Ms Pattison in condemning the programme, which is part of the BBC's Sex Season. She said: 'The BBC should not screen this . programme. It seems to me that they are just trying to set new . boundaries and to do this at 9pm when a lot of young people will still . be up is horrendous.' Shamed: Russell Brand and Jonathan who had to make an apology to Andrew Sachs over an offensive prank phone call . Ms Pattison, who is to make an official complaint to the BBC and Ofcom, claimed the show was 'prurient and exploitative'. She added: 'It . is extraordinary that in following a teenager getting ready to lose her . virginity, a bikini wax is filmed as an essential part of her . preparation but condoms are not even mentioned. Ban it: Ann Widdecombe has urged the BBC not to screen the show . 'The . programme promises ""essential truths amongst the tales of sex and . debauchery, to see if losing your virginity is about more than just . ­having sex for the first time"". 'However, . it delivers an inconclusive mix of titillating detail and voyeuristic . confessional.' The BBC was fined £150,000 for breaching Ofcom's code when Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand used offensive language during prank calls to Andrew Sachs on Radio 2. The controversial programme begins with Healey, 31, a . former Cheltenham Ladies’ College pupil, reading from her diary when she . was 16. She reads: “I’m going to **** Ed senseless.' It introduces a young man, . Dan, from a jazz band who shows her a condom described as a 'willy hat' and jokes with her about sexual positions. She . then hosts a discussion with a group of young men, one of whom claims . he had oral sex with a woman outside McDonalds. Beth Taylor, a 17-year-old virgin, is filmed having a bikini . wax before going on holiday. Ms Pattison said: “She is packed off to Lanzarote to lose her virginity without even a condom.' Ms Widdecombe told the Sunday Express: 'It is difficult to see how parents and teachers have any chance at all of getting young people to behave responsibly if this is the sort of stuff the BBC is promoting. 'It will not help with efforts to reduce teenage pregnancy rates in Britain, which are the highest in Europe.' A Church of England spokesman claimed the programme was likely to anger people who believed that sexual activity should be confined within a faithful, heterosexual marriage. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Cherry Healey: Like A Virgin adheres to BBC editorial guidelines and is scheduled appropriately with a strong language warning prior to transmission.'","Programme includes F-word and talk about oral sex .

The female half of a duo accused of being the 'new Bonnie and Clyde' after a bloody 330-mile crime spree claims she was the victim of a meth-addled 'evil person' who was planning to kill her. Far from being his willing accomplice, Angela Hill says she was kidnapped - 'in a way' - by Logan McFarland and dragged on a trip that ended after a high-speed chase on the interstate. Authorities aren't buying the sob story and have charged Hill, 25 - also known as Angela Attwood - with attempted murder. They allege she shot Rattana Keomanivong in the back of the head during a botched carjacking in West Wendover, Nevada. Angela Hill (left) says she was kidnapped 'in a way' by Logan McFarland (right) and dragged on a 330-mile crime spree . Murdered: Leroy and Dorothy Fullwood were found shot to death in their home. McFarland is charged with their murder . Authorities have charged Hill with attempted murder and allege she shot Rattana Keomanivong (pictured) in the back of the head during a botched carjacking in West Wendover, Nevada . In a jailhouse interview with the Salt . Lake Tribune, Hill sobbed as she said she didn't belong behind bars. However, she would not explain exactly how she was innocent of the . crimes when Ms Keomanjvong reported her as the one who tried to rob her . at gunpoint. 'This is not Bonnie and Clyde,' Hill said. 'People are making me out to be an animal, and I’m not.' Instead, . Hill blamed the deadly cross-country rampage on McFarland, a high . school friend, who she says beat her and threatened to kill her. She says he took methamphetamine as the two drove across three towns and evaded police for five days. Hill showed the Salt Lake Tribune reporter broken teeth she says are the result of being punched in the mouth by McFarland. 'He’s evil. He’s an evil person,' she said. She says she went to visit McFarland on December 31 with a friend, even though she hadn't seen the man in years. One day earlier, police say McFarland broke into the home of Leroy and Dorotha Ann Fullwood, ages 70 and 69, in Mount Pleasant, Utah, and shot them both in the head during a robbery. He has been charged with the elderly couple's murder. According to her story, Hill was not with McFarland during the bloody shootings. After she met McFarland, the pair drove to West Wendover, Nevada, and ambushed Ms Keomanivong in the parking lot of a casino. Both of them were armed, Ms Keomanivong told the High Desert Advocate. The victim told police Hill forced her into her own car and told her to drive. McFarland followed in a car he had allegedly stolen on December 29. Ms Keomanivong eventually fought back, biting Hill in the ear and the neck and forcing her out of the car. The gym owner, who was named West Wendover's strongest woman last year, was shot in the back of the head while fleeing. Police say Hill fired the shot, but she told the Tribune: 'I was not the shooter.' The pair were arrested January 4 on a ranch after being spotted by a plane circling overhead. 'I was the one who waved to the plane,' she said. 'I was so glad when the police came, because I probably would have been dead too.'","Angela Hill claims she was kidnapped... 'in a way'

"By . Nick Pisa In Rome . Last updated at 4:23 PM on 9th January 2012 . An investigation has been launched after the bodies of dozens of dogs, cats and rabbits were found dumped in an Italian lake. Officials suspect the dogs were bred for illegal fights, but other animals had single knife wounds which some suggest may have been inflicted during a bloody mafia initiation ceremony. There are also fears the dead animals may have been bred for international export to supply labs conducting experiments - in recent years the mafia is said to have made millions from the supply of animals for this reason. Macabre discovery: Some of the dead animals found next to Frezza lake near Naples, Italy. The horde of corpses is believed to be work of a mafia gang called the Camorra . The latest discovery was made at Frezza lake in countryside near Naples, an area traditionally a stronghold of the local mafia known as the Camorra. Vets are carrying out postmortem examinations on the animals - some of which were found in plastic bags that had floated to the surface of the lake - at a specialist centre in Naples and prosecutors are waiting for a full report on the macabre discovery. An initial investigation has revealed that none of the dogs have the compulsory microchip inserted under their skin as Italian law insists which has further fuelled suspicions the animals were bred illegally. Italian animal defence group AIDAA said they had no doubt that the Camorra was behind the grizzly discovery of the corpses and suggested that some had been killed by 'would-be new Camorra members as a sign of their willingness to kill.' Convinced: Lorenzo Croce, president of Italian animal defence group AIDAA, claims there is no doubt the Camorra is behind the massacre . President Lorenzo Croce added: 'We know that the Camorra is running dogfights for illegal gambling and holding dogs in what can only be described as canine concentration camps until they are ready to fight. 'Other animals are also being used in international trafficking for vivisection purposes - we believe that this discovery is just the tip of the iceberg and there are many other dumping sites around the region.' A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Naples said they were aware of the discovery and investigating the find while waiting for official postmortem results. According to AIDAA, dog rackets provide the Camorra with annual profits of between six and seven million euros. Although less well-known than their Sicilian Mafia counterparts, the Camorra have a more blood-thirsty reputation with rival clans happily killing each other for control of lucrative drug cartels. One of the most infamous massacres was in 2008 when six Africans were gunned down in a hail of bullets in a shop near Naples after they tried to muscle in on a Camorra drug route while already this year there have been three Camorra murders in the city.","Dogs, cats and rabbits discovered in plastic bags .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 11:34 AM on 9th January 2012 . Carnaby Street in Central London was crowded, but heavy discounts failed to bring an expected boost in spending . Spending on the High Street fell over Christmas despite heavy discounts designed to entice us into parting with our cash. Many sales started before Christmas, but the amount we spent both in shops and online tumbled on a monthly and yearly basis. Even the amount spent over the festive season on food, alcohol and tobacco fell by 5.3 per cent while spending on transport and communication also saw an annual decrease of 5.8 per cent. Overall spending fell by 1.1 per cent month-on-month in December and by 0.8 per cent when compared with the same period in 2010. Those behind the survey said the monthly drop reflected recent volatility as consumers become very cautious amid an uncertain economic backdrop. Mail and telephone order spending saw a 3 per cent year-on-year decline, while face-to-face spending decreased by 1.4 per cent and online spending saw a more modest annual decline of 0.4 per cent. This is the first time in two-and-a-half years that a year-on-year decline has been recorded for all three of these methods. Consumer spending has not recovered since a peak in 2007, those behind the survey said. Visa’s UK Expenditure Index uses spending on its cards as a base, but the figures are adjusted to reflect overall consumer spending, not just that on Visa cards. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the report, said: 'A 1.1 per cent drop in consumer spending in December caused expenditure to fall 0.9 per cent over the fourth quarter as a whole. 'With the consumer accounting for approximately two thirds of all expenditure in the economy, the downturn clearly adds to worries that the UK may be sliding back into recession. 'The data also highlights the plight that retailers have suffered over the key Christmas trading period, with even online sellers not immune to households’ increasing reluctance to spend.' Heavy discounts caused a rush at shops like this Selfridges on Oxford Street, London. but consumers are becoming more savvy and cautious about spending . Despite several sectors seeing a decline over the year, hotels and restaurants saw the biggest boost, with 12 per cent growth in spending, while the clothing and footwear sector recorded a 6.7 per cent rise. Dr Steve Perry, commercial director at Visa Europe, said: 'Against a backdrop of challenging economic circumstances, consumers’ uncertainty translated into subdued Christmas spending, despite heavy discounting both on the high street and online. 'It is clear that consumers have become increasingly savvy and cautious about where they choose to spend.' Share prices in Tesco and Sainsbury's fell this morning amid further evidence of subdued retail demand. Tesco slipped 1.9p to 389p while . Sainsbury's shed 0.3p to 298.5p. They will report figures later this . week with Tesco expected to post one of its weakest Christmas trading . periods in several years. Among the larger brands that reported slowdowns were Morrisons and HMV, underlining the fierce competition in both sectors. Luxury car company Rolls-Royce had a record year in 2011, it was announced today. The Sussex-based company sold 3,538 cars worldwide last year - 31 per cent more than in 2010 and more than the previous record year of 1978 when the figure was 3,347. China was the company's biggest market last year, followed by the United States and the UK, where there was 30 per cent growth. The record sales follow the announcement last September that Rolls-Royce intends to expand its manufacturing plant at Goodwood in West Sussex. Work on this will begin next month. 'We had an outstanding year in 2011 and we should take a moment to reflect on this great British success story,' said Rolls-Royce Motor Cars chief executive Torsten Muller-Otvos. 'Our business is in excellent shape. 'We are developing our dealer network, moving into new markets like South America, expanding our manufacturing operation in West Sussex to meet global demand and have plans to develop our product range. 'At the core of this extraordinary success is a dedicated, committed and, above all, passionate workforce.' JD Sports Fashion today confirmed it is close to landing 'certain assets' of the ailing retailer Blacks Leisure. The . company, whose largest shareholder Pentland owns the outdoor brands . Berghaus and Brasher, has reportedly offered £20m for most of the 300 Blacks and Millets stores. However, it is not expected to want the company’s . warehouse and head office. JD confirmed it is in advanced discussions . over an offer for certain assets and said a further announcement would . be made on conclusion of the talks. It also said it would retain many of . Blacks’ 3,500 staff. The deal is likely to be as part . of a pre-pack administration, when a company emerges under new ownership . following a pre-arranged sale. The process is viewed as controversial . because creditors do not have the opportunity to vote against the . proposed asset sale. JD is thought to have beaten Dragons’ Den star . Peter Jones, rival Sports Direct, which is owned by Newcastle United . owner Mike Ashley, and outdoor retailer Trespass to land the stores. Bury-based . JD currently has around 350 JD Sports outlets in the UK. The . supermarket reported a slowdown in sales with like-for-like sales . excluding VAT and fuel increase 0.7 per cent in the seeks weeks to . January 1. That compares with 2.4 per cent in the previous quarter and is lower than the City's expected growth of one per cent. The . slowdown came despite Morrisons, the fourth biggest supermarket in the . UK, claiming a record number of customers, with an extra 800,000 per . week shopping there during the period. The battle for sales gathered pace in early October when Tesco introduced its Big Price Drop, prompting Sainsbury’s to launch a price-matching scheme and Asda to slash petrol prices. HMV, which owns 252 stores in the UK, said its plans to shift focus to technology products, by refitting stores with an extended gadget range, saw group like-for-like sales fall 8.1 per cent in the five weeks to December 31. But in the 144 stores refitted with an increased range of portable digital products, like-for-like technology sales were up 51 per cent. Morrisons reported a slow-down in pre-Christmas sales showing the fierce competition in the supermarket sector . HMV has increased its range of portable digital products to mitigate for falls in music sales . HMV, which recently sold bookseller . Waterstone’s and announced plans to sell its live music division, . repeated its warning that there were 'material uncertainties' which may . cast doubt on the group’s ability to continue. Freddie George, a retail analyst at Seymour Pierce stockbrokers, said the update was marginally better than expected. An Arabian retail group is poised to buy part of high street lingerie chain La Senza, its owner said today. Alshaya, which owns stakes in a number of British retailers including Next, Debenhams and Mothercare, is in advanced talks to buy part of the business - understood to be 60 stores - as part of a pre-pack administration deal. Around 80 shops remain under threat of closure after La Senza, which is owned by private equity firm Lion Capital, announced its intention before Christmas to appoint an administrator, which is now expected to be KPMG. As well as tough trading conditions, the chain has been weighed down by leases agreed by sister lingerie chain Contessa with which it merged in 2007. A spokeswoman for Lion Capital said: 'We can confirm that Alshaya, a leading international retail franchise operator, is in advanced discussions with La Senza regarding a potential acquisition of part of the UK La Senza business.' Theo Paphitis, Dragons' Den star and former owner of La Senza, disclosed the pending deal on his Twitter feed over the weekend. He said: 'Good news and bad news re @LaSenzaUK heard that Lion has done a deal to sell the business with about 60 shops to Alshaya group.' He added: 'The bad news re @lasenza is that the other 80 shops will be closed down or put in the hands of Admin KPMG with resulting job losses.Sad!' But chief executive Simon Fox added: . 'Undoubtedly trading conditions and the consumer environment remain . challenging, but we remain confident in HMV’s future prospects.' He added: 'It is encouraging that the HMV Retail business has seen an improvement in trading although the like-for-like sales were still negative. 'We remain concerned, however, that net debt levels are high at £160 million following the disposal of Waterstone’s and HMV Canada.' Elsewhere, HMV reported a 9.7 per cent decline in group like-for-like sales in the nine weeks to December 31. The group said its previously announced strategic review of HMV Live, which runs 13 venues and a number of festivals including Lovebox in London and Global Gathering near Stratford-upon-Avon, was making good progress. The chain has felt the pressure of the consumer spending squeeze as cash-strapped customers turn to cheaper deals on the internet for music and film. HMV disclosed a bottom-line pre-tax loss of £45.7 million in the 26 weeks to October 29, compared with £27.4 million the previous year, while like-for-like retail sales fell 13.2 per cent in the seven weeks to December 17. The group previously announced the closure of up to 40 stores in a bid to make millions of pounds of cost savings, with 15 shut in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, the sale of Waterstone’s and HMV Canada raised the group £55 million and ensured a £220 million refinancing deal with its lending banks. HMV was the first of many retailers to report this week on their performance over the Christmas break with Marks & Spencer, Argos owner Home Retail Group, chocolatier Thorntons and supermarkets Tesco and Sainsbury all publishing updates.","Mail and telephone order also fell 3% year-on-year .

A cargo ship grounded off the New Zealand coast since October has split in two, spilling sea containers and debris and sparking fears of a fresh oil spill, maritime officials said. The wreck of the Greek-owned Rena was described as New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster even before the rear section of the ship, lashed by pounding seas, broke away yesterday. The ship previously spilled heavy fuel oil that fouled pristine North Island beaches and killed up to 20,000 seabirds, and despite salvage efforts nearly 400 tons of oil remain onboard.

The stranded cargo ship Rena after its hull split into two, caused by heavy swells, wind and rain off New Zealand . Maritime officials said the front section of the wreck remains stuck in its original position, but the stern section slipped at least 100ft away from the bow and is 'moving significantly,' pounded by 19ft swells. The storm that split the vessel will continue for another three to four days, Maritime New Zealand spokesman Ross Henderson said. Officials said up to 300 of the roughly 880 containers that had been on board were lost when the ship broke apart. Of those, about 30 per cent had been fitted with monitoring devices and some 30 containers had already been located. The storm that split the vessel will continue for another three to four days, Maritime New Zealand spokesman Ross Henderson said . Environment Minister Nick Smith said there is roughly 385 tons of oil still aboard the ship . Oil has been seen leaking from the . broken ship. Alex van Wijngaarden, on-scene commander for the national . response team, said oil from the vessel could come ashore last night. 'While . reports at this stage indicate there has not been a significant release . of oil, with the Rena in its current fragile state, a further release . is likely,' he said. 'While . it is unknown at this stage exactly how much oil may be released, teams . have been mobilized and will be ready to respond to anything that may . come ashore.'

Beached: Visitors point at a washed up container, as firemen walk alongside other debris on Waihi Beach . Environment Minister Nick Smith said that the 'risks for the environment are a fraction of what they were in October,' though the roughly 385 tons of oil still aboard the ship is about the same amount that leaked from the vessel soon after it ran aground. Salvage crews previously removed 1,100 tons of oil from the ship. Most of the oil is in tanks in the stern section, which could end up sinking. Some of that oil could end up dissipating in the ocean rather than washing up on beaches. The containers, meanwhile, spilled goods including timber, wool, bales of recycled plastic and bags of milk powder. The debris could begin washing ashore later Sunday. Some containers have been sighted floating up to 20 miles northwest of the stricken ship, Port of Tauranga chief executive Mark Cairns said. 'They have been caught in a strong coastal current' fueled by the storm, he said. The Rena ran aground on Astrolabe Reef 14 miles from Tauranga Harbour on North Island on October 5. Salvage crews have plucked 389 of the ship's 1,370 loaded cargo containers from its decks since it ran aground, while some 98 have been washed over board in the past three months. One eyewitness, Warwick Roberts, said the rear section was sliding along the reef. The 'stern has reared up and center section is not visible. Large breaking waves observed on bow,' he said. Clean up: Soldiers worked to clear away the oil spill from the beach in Taurange, New Zealand, as environmentalists warned of a potential wildlife disaster . Removal: Bulldozers and diggers have been drafted on to Waihi beach to take away the shipping containers . In trouble: Rescuers have been unable to properly reach the ship due to the severe structural damage it has suffered . Destruction: Washed up container roll slowly up to the beach . Investigators were unable to explain how the vessel managed to perch itself on a New Zealand reef before the split . A two-mile no-go zone is in force around the wreck. Investigations last month revealed that Australian authorities impounded the vessel, but released it the next day after Liberian maritime authorities intervened, essentially saying the ship was safe to sail and the problems could be fixed later. The Rena, like many ships, is registered in Liberia. Some 10 weeks later, the Rena ran full-steam into a well-marked reef off the coast of New Zealand. It's not clear whether the previously identified problems played any role. The captain and Rena's navigating officer face criminal charges of operating a ship in a dangerous or risky manner, polluting the environment and altering the ship's documents after the crash. Other items from the containers washed up in Tauranga, New Zealand included these deer skins . Rescuers have been trying to get near the vessel to transfer away the ship's oil since October .","Greek-owned Rena has been grounded since October .

A father who almost died trying to save his son after he fell ten feet down a manhole filled with sewage is outraged the city has not taken steps to ensure it doesn't happen again. Bob Anderson, from Albuquerque, is demanding the city make the necessary changes after his five-year-old son fell down the manhole in the middle of a construction zone a week ago. He said it was dark when he and his family were walking along the street and they did not see that the metal sheets covering it had been removed. Scroll down for video . Danger: Bob Anderson said he and his son could have died had his wife not bee there to pull them to safety . Manhole: Both Mr Anderson and his son, five, were stuck in the hole with sewage filling their mouths . Bob Anderson told KOB.com: 'We could have lost him out here. We could have lost me, could have lost him because there . is no way out of these things.' He said his son was running ahead of him and his wife when he suddenly plunged down the hole. His immediate reaction was to jump in after his son to rescue him. Sewage filled both of their mouths as they began to go under. It was only when they bobbed back up that Mr Anderson's wife was able to grab her son and pull him to safety. She then helped her husband out of the hole. Both of them could have died. But city officials said the manhole covers at the Lead Improvement Project would not change despite the obvious danger. No change: When he went back to check a week later, he was shocked to find the same metal sheets covering the hole and nothing else . Spokesman Mark Motsko said: 'We really want to take some time and thank the family and the father for being brave enough for going in after his little boy . Measures: The city said they cannot place anything heavier there as it would be more hazardous but have increased patrol . Mr Anderson said he has been feeling sick ever since and has had to visit the emergency room on several occasions due to bacteria . He has also been back to check if the city has made any changes after he alerted them to the danger. But he was shocked to find the same sheets of steel just sitting on top of the holes. He said: 'They’re (the city) trying to blame the people for their sloppiness and their job here. I‘m afraid somebody’s going to get hurt before this is all over.' Albuquerque Department of Municipal Development spokesman Mark Motsko said: 'We really want to take some time and thank the family and the father for being brave enough for going in after his little boy and saving him, because this could have been a horrible story.' But he said there is still nothing they can do about the hole as anything heavier placed there would be a hazard to get off if there was an accident. They have instead increased patrol in the area.

Seven passengers on a Qantas superjet flying from London to Sydney were injured today when the aircraft struck severe turbulence over the Indian Ocean. Many of the passengers on board the A380 were Britons heading for the sun in the Australian summer. Four of the seven who received cuts and bruises were taken to hospital in Singapore for treatment, while the other three were treated at the medical centre in Changi airport. Injured: Seven passengers on the Qantas A380 flight required medical treatment . Qantas said the turbulence was the result of severe thunderstorms over the Indian Ocean, in Indian air space, three hours before the jet was due to land in Singapore for refuelling. A spokeswoman said the seatbelt sign went on immediately the aircraft hit the turbulence but some passengers were still standing or making their way back to their seats. 'Striking bad weather is not unusual,' she said. The aircraft was struck by severe turbulence over the Indian Ocean. File picture . 'The aircraft diverted around most of it but it was the initial part of the storm that had the impact.' She described the injuries as minor cuts and bruises. Engineers carried out a thorough inspection of the jet, named after Australian aviation pioneer Charles Kingsford Smith, and declared that no damage had been caused and it was fit to return to the skies. The jet was due to arrive in Sydney late on Sunday. Emergency: Three of those injured were treated at the medical centre in Changi airport, pictured . Qantas has received 12 of the 20 A380 'double decker' supersets it has ordered. Just last week the airline reassured passengers there was no risk to safety after cracks were found on the wings of several A380 jets owned by a number of airlines around the world. The airline said that minuscule cracking had been found in the wing ribs on one of its A380s but no immediate action was required because it presented no risk to flight safety.","Four of those suffering cuts and bruises taken to hospital in Singapore for treatment .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 9:57 AM on 9th January 2012 . Ed Miliband must work harder to get his message across to the public if Labour is to recover from a 'shaky start' to 2012, senior Labour MP Alan Johnson warned. The former cabinet minister said he believed the party leader had 'the personality, the intellect and the steely determination to succeed'. But he said that unless he got out 'on the stump' to gain public recognition and made the Opposition sound more relevant to ordinary voters it would be in trouble. The intervention of Mr Johnson, who stepped down as shadow chancellor almost a year ago for personal reasons, comes after a damning poll showed most voters not think that Mr Miliband is doing a worse job than Nick Clegg. Under pressure: Most think Ed Miliband, left, is not performing well as Labour leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, right, is not that popular either . The YouGov survey found that just 20 . per cent of people say Mr Miliband is performing well as Labour leader, . while 21 per cent think the same of Mr Clegg as leader of the Liberal . Democrats, despite his party’s unpopularity. By contrast, 44 per cent of people think David Cameron is doing well as Prime Minister. The findings – the worst for Mr . Miliband since he defeated his brother David for the Labour crown – came . as MPs began to suggest publicly that he needs to 'get a grip'. One of the party’s most senior figures . said yesterday that the Labour leader had yet to develop a 'credible . and compelling' economic position. Former chancellor Alistair Darling – touted as a potential caretaker leader – said Labour has a 'lot more to do'. More...

You can't quit UK without my approval, David Cameron warns Scots as First Minister Alex Salmond pushes for a referendum . Secret justice: How Cameron and Clegg vowed to hand back our liberties but are instead planning illiberal changes to justice system . The poll rounded off Mr Miliband’s . worst week – one in which his own policy guru Lord Glasman admitted the . party had 'no strategy, no narrative and little energy' under his . leadership and his spin chief Tom Baldwin was forced to reject . comparisons with Iain Duncan Smith. Best of three: David Cameron is currently seen as the most capable of the three party leaders by voters, but Nick Clegg, right, comes in ahead of Mr Miliband . Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott gave . him a fresh headache with a racism row after she attacked white people . for liking to 'divide and rule'. And it was compounded by the party . leader himself when he accidentally referred to ‘Blackbusters’ in a . comment on the death of Blockbusters host Bob Holness. Mr Johnson wrote in The Mirror that it . was a 'pivotal year' for Labour, which he said is in 'good shape' but . was not getting its message across. “Small opinion poll leads, welcome as . they are, cannot hide the fact that the public remain suspicious about . Labour,' said Mr Johnson. 'A long way to go': Alistair Darling said that it wasn't true to say Mr Miliband wasn't having an impact, but that more work was required . That was not helped by 'unfortunate . comments by people who profess their support for the leader they are . busily undermining', he said - in a swipe at Lord Glasman. But Mr Johnson conceded that the . leadership was not helping itself by failing to present its policies . effectively and too often sounding like a 'debating society' or . 'university seminar'. 'At the moment Labour is like a pearl . stuck firmly inside an oyster. Inside there’s a gem but the public can . only see the shell,' he wrote. 'In my view, Ed Miliband has the . personality, the intellect and the steely determination to succeed - to . set out a vision for a better society, to formulate a clear message and . to face up to the difficult priorities that will need to be set.' But that required 'a better grip on . messaging, including over who speaks and when', he added, and . recognition by shadow ministers that they had to offer a 'credible . alternative” as well as criticising the coalition. 'The leader must be the authentic . voice and should be the public face of the Labour Party. That means . going out on the stump, constantly identifying those issues which . resonate with the public, and hammering home Labour’s message,' he . concluded. 'We cannot get to 2015 and an election with the public and the media asking the question: Who is Ed Miliband?' Mr Miliband will tomorrow make a . speech on the economy in what is being seen as a relaunch of his . faltering leadership. He is expected to insist that Labour accepts the . need for austerity and must ‘come to terms’ with the fact that it cannot . repeat the politics of the New Labour years, focused on ever-higher . public spending. Mr Darling said it was ‘simply not . true’ to say that Mr Miliband was not having an impact. 'Obviously we’ve . got a lot more to do; we’ve got to restore our reputation for economic . credibility,’ he added. ‘We’ve got a long way to go. We need to be further ahead in the polls.' In remarks that will be seen as a . swipe at Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who insists the Government should . borrow more money to mitigate austerity, Mr Darling added: 'What we do . need to do is to establish a credible and compelling position on the . economy. 'We need to be clear about our values, . what sort of country we want to see, where jobs are going to come from . in an increasingly difficult world.' Bookmakers yesterday halved the odds . on Mr Darling becoming the next Labour leader to 25/1, but he insisted: . 'I’m a backbench Labour MP, I’m happy to serve there.' Blairite MPs were instead said to be . ready to join Brownites in backing Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . as leader if Mr Miliband goes. Some apparently believe the party has . no chance at the next Election and David Miliband could return as leader . only after another candidate has tried and failed to regain power. Labour MP Graham Stringer attacked Mr Miliband for failing to sack Miss Abbott last week, adding: 'Ed has got to get a grip.' And Birmingham MP Roger Godsiff said: . 'We need fresh thinking and to break with the old order economically. And we must do it with people who are credible with the electorate.' A former senior Labour adviser urged . Mr Miliband to embark on 'a far bigger and blunter conversation' about . spending choices facing the country. Gavin Kelly, a deputy chief of staff . to Gordon Brown, said Labour could not dodge difficult choices on the . deficit with vague assertions that spending will have to be constrained . for at least a decade. But Labour business spokesman Chuka . Umunna said it was 'absolutely ridiculous' to suggest Mr Miliband would . not be leader in a year’s time. He said Labour had 60,000 more members . since Mr Miliband took the helm, though that figure is in doubt since . thousands are also thought to have left and half of the party’s . membership is now said to be made up of teachers.

A family doctor blackmailed a patient into submitting to his sexual demands in return for flu medication, a tribunal heard yesterday. Gordon Barclay, 68, waved a green prescription form in the mother-of-one’s face, it was alleged, saying ‘You need that don’t you – I need to examine you’ before ordering her to strip off. On another occasion when she complained of suffering from a fever, he felt her breasts with his stethoscope, the hearing was told. Blackmailed for a prescription? The doctor (not pictured)  is also accused of feeling the patient's breasts with a stethoscope when she complained of a fever . He even went to her home when she left after he demanded she took her clothes off, told her she needed to be ‘examined’ then had sex with her, it was alleged. The woman, referred to only as Patient A, was said to have been repeatedly molested during intimate examinations between July 2003 and July 2006 at the surgery in Essex. She broke down in tears as she gave evidence to the General Medical Council yesterday, saying she felt she had no choice but to comply. ‘He said “You need medication and I need to examine you”, so it’s some kind of blackmailing. That’s if I don’t let him examine me I wouldn’t have that prescription,’ she said. Hearing: The case is being heard at the General Medical Council (pictured) Patient A said the first time he sexually assaulted her was when she had been suffering from flu, arriving at the surgery with her young son. She said Barclay told the boy to go back to the waiting room, saying ‘patients’ privacy, I need to talk to your mum alone’. She went on: ‘He told me to take off my clothes – I was shivering, I was so cold, I told him I was very cold and he said “You’ll get your medication, don’t worry”.’ The woman said Barclay, of Romford, Essex, came to her flat on one occasion after she refused his advances at the surgery and said he needed to examine her. 'It’s some kind of blackmail' She added: ‘I said there’s a settee in the living room and he said “No, no, no, you come here” and he held my hand and the next room is the bedroom and then we were in there. ‘He always says “Take off your clothes”, whatever examination it is.’ She then told how the GP had sex with her. She claimed every time she saw the doctor except once he ‘examined’ her in this way and that if she did not come to the surgery for a few days he would phone and ask why she had not come in. The hearing was told Patient A had a history of depression and anxiety and had been investigated for short-term memory loss. She had seen a neurologist and had a brain scan due to headaches. Barclay prescribed her Prozac which helped relieve her pain but then told her it was for ‘mad people and the mentally challenged’, she said. Insisting the sex had not been consensual, she insisted: ‘It’s against my will, he’s forcing me to do that.’ Barclay, who is also an NHS trust medical adviser, was not at the hearing. He denies misconduct charges and faces allegations relating to a second woman known as Patient B. The fitness to practise hearing in Manchester continues.","GP accused of repeatedly molesting patient in medical examinations .

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 4:05 PM on 8th January 2012 . Investigated: Sir Jimmy Saville was the subject of an investigation into claims he was accused of molesting girls . Sir Jimmy Saville was the subject of a two-month sex pest investigation by journalists from the BBC, it was claimed today. Reporters from Newsnight launched a probe into allegations about inappropriate behaviour by the Jim'll Fix It legend towards schoolgirls just days after his death on October 29. But they were eventually told to spike the story, which was due to be broadcast just days before a BBC1 Christmas special celebrating the presenter's life. Newsnight journalists interviewed three women who met Sir Jimmy in the Seventies when, as presenter of Top Of The Pops, he was at the height of his fame, Sunday Mirror reported. All three were teenage pupils at a school in Surrey which the broadcaster visited regularly as part of his charity work. It is claimed that Sir Jimmy took girls there for rides in his car. Each of the women is said to have alleged that he had taken them out, individually, in his car and behaved inappropriately towards them. One of the women, who is now in her 50s, agreed to waive her anonymity and allow herself to be interviewed by Newsnight reporters on camera, the Sunday Mirror said. The investigation was launched after journalists for the flagship BBC news programme discovered that complaints about Sir Jimmy were made to Surrey police in 2007 - nearly 40 years after the incidents were alleged to have taken place. Police carried out their own investigation at the time, but the Crown Prosecution Service was not convinced there was enough evidence to take action against the star. A BBC source told the Sunday Mirror . that journalists hoped to establish the truth of the claims and the . details of the police investigation by interviewing the three women. But . senior figures in the corporation then told reporters to scrap the . report, which would have clashed with a Boxing Day Jim'll Fix It tribute . programme hosted by Shane Richie. Height of his fame: The alleged inappropriate behaviour is said to have taken place while Sir Jimmy was presenter of Top Of The Pops . The decision to spike the story is said to have angered many staff, who had spent months working on the report. 'Someone, somewhere should have realised that a report trying to uncover a dark side of one of the BBC’s favourite sons was a silly thing to do,' the source told the Sunday Mirror. Surrey Police confirmed that allegations had been made and investigated, and a CPS spokesman said a reviewing lawyer had advised officers a lack of evidence meant no action could be taken. Sir Jimmy's friends and family were upset at the revelations regarding the investigation. The star's niece, Janet Humble accused Newsnight of 'muck-raking'. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'As a family we just wish Sir Jim could be left to rest in peace.' Stephen Purdew, Sir Jimmy's friend of 30 years, who helped to organise his funeral, said: 'These are allegations from 40 years ago. He’s not even alive to defend himself.' The BBC today insisted that Newsnight's investigation focused on alleged failings within the CPS, and the story was spiked because they did not have enough proof to stand it up - not because of executive interference. A BBC spokesman said: 'Any suggestion that a story was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons is completely untrue. 'The BBC gathers information on hundreds of stories and not all make it to air. In this case the angle we were pursuing could not be substantiated.'","Newsnight story had been due to broadcast days before a Christmas special celebrating the star's life .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:26 PM on 10th January 2012 . It's no secret that Tim Tebow’s favourite Bible passage is John 3:16, but his performance Sunday took those numbers to biblical proportions. The rookie quarterback, in the first playoff game of his career, threw for 316 total yards and averaged an impressive 31.6 yards per pass. In addition, the overtime portion of the game, in which Tebow threw the game-winning 80-yard pass, scored a 31.6 television rating. Scroll down for video . For your eyes only: Tim Tebow famously donned 'John 3:16' eye black when he led the University of Florida Gators to a win over the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2009 BCS National Championship quarterback Tim Tebow . During Tebow's college days with the University of Florida Gators, he wore eye black branded with different bible verses. In the 2009 BCS National Championship, which he famously led the Gators to victory over the Oklahoma Sooners, the message on his eye black was 'John 3:16'. After his graduation, messages on eye black were outlawed for college football players in a ban now known as 'the Tebow rule'. In the NFL, such a practice is also against the rules. The passage reads: 'For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.' Since breaking into the NFL's top ranks this season, Tim Tebow has made headlines as much for his outspoken religious beliefs as for his performances for the Denver Broncos. And his claims to be helped by God were bolstered when sharp-eyed fans saw a halo floating above the stadium where he helped the Broncos to a spectacular overtime victory over the Steelers on Sunday. The ring of smoke appeared over the Mile High Stadium in Denver just after the Broncos scored their first field goal in the wild-card game which they won 29-23. Divine favour: A halo appeared in the sky above Mile High Stadium while the Denver Broncos were playing against the Pittsburgh Steelers there on Sunday . The game ended after the first play of overtime - just 11 seconds in - when the quarterback launched the incredible pass for a touchdown. Tebow's amazing performance in the game cemented the 24-year-old's cult status - and the appearance of the halo in the sky above suggested his non-stop invocation of his religion may not have been in vain. The divine apparition was snapped by Mark Neuman-Lee, who told the Huffington Post he'd never seen the phenomenon in the area before. Two season-ticket holders at the stadium said they too thought the vision was unprecedented. Tebow, Tebowing: The unusual position the quarterback takes while praying on the field has inspired an internet craze, with people competing to pray in the most humorous situation . Celebration: Tebow's brilliant 80-yard throw won the game after just 11 seconds of overtime . It was not the only divine coincidence surrounding the match, however. Many commentators noticed that Tebow threw a total of 316 yards, evoking memories of the Bible verse John 3:16, which Tebow wrote on his eye paint when he was playing for the Florida Gators and which surged to the top of Google rankings after his appearance in the 2009 BCS Championship Game. Tebow's success with the Broncos is considered by some to be particularly miraculous as he has masterminded an unusual number of victories from a losing position. Apart from his sporting heroics, Tebow is best known for inspiring an internet craze named after him.Tebowing - kneeling down to pray in an incongruous or humorous situation - derives from the footballer's pious habit of praying in the middle of the pitch. And recently a driver was spotted who took very direct inspiration from Tebow, adorning his car with the numberplate 'WWTD15' - or 'What would Tebow do?', followed by his jersey number. Star: The quarterback, a very devout Christian, has attributed much of his success to God .

"By . Thomas Durante and Hugo Gye . Last updated at 10:21 AM on 10th January 2012 . Speculation is mounting that the President's chief of staff was been effectively forced out by Barack Obama's move to the left ahead of this year's election. President Obama announced yesterday that . William Daley, who was hired to forge links with big business and Congress Republicans, is stepping down from his post, making him his third chief . of staff to quit in three years. Mr Obama has aggressively targeted Congress, which he says has blocked the workings of government, and is looking to strike a more populist economic tone ahead of his re-election campaign. Moving on: President Obama announced at the White House today that his Chief of Staff William Daley, right, would be resigning and replaced by Budget Director Jack Lew, left . Mr Daley is resigning after only a . year on the job - to return to his native Chicago and spend more time . with his family, he says. He will be replaced by . Budget Director Jack Lew, whom the president called the 'clear choice' for one of the toughest jobs in D.C. Mr Lew will be the third permanent chief of staff in Mr Obama's presidency - in the midst of a re-election year. William Daley is a lawyer who made his career in banking. He is the son of Richard M. Daley, who was mayor of Chicago for 21 years. Mr Daley served as Midwest Chairman of JPMorgan Chase from 2004 until President Obama picked him for chief of staff. He was Secretary of Commerce under . President Bill Clinton from 1997 until 2000 and helped with the passage . of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Daley has stepped down from his chief of staff post after just one year. Mr Daley, 63, was considered a . centrist Democrat with close ties to big business, having worked in the . pharmaceuticals industry and as a top lobbyist for bank JPMorgan Chase. Now that Mr Obama is in re-election . mode, bashing business and the Republicans and seeking to define himself . in opposition to Congress, this could have made Mr Daley an awkward fit . in the White House. 'The Daley departure marks the end of . Obama’s attempt to look pro-business,' conservative commentator Phil . Kerpen told Politico, predicting that the President would now be . 'playing to his ideologically motivated left-wing base'. And a former top congressional aide . for the Democrats told the Huffington Post: 'Bill Daley was brought in . for two things: He has a good connection to the business community and a . record of working with Republicans.' The former aide claimed that Congress . Republicans 'don't want to be worked with', meaning that Mr Daley ended . up as 'an ineffective chief of staff'. Mr Obama's difficult relationship . with Congress - which has worsened rather than improved while Mr Daley . has been in office - deteriorated further last week when he took . advantage of a one-day Senate 'recess' to appoint Richard Cordray to . head a new consumer watchdog body. Michelle Obama was 'distressed' by the dominance of Chicago politics by 'white Irish Catholic' families, according to a new book. The Obamas, by New York Times journalist Jodi Kantor, claims that when Mrs Obama worked for the city's mayor she complained that 'power in Illinois was locked up generation after generation by a small group of families'. Bill Daley, who has just resigned as White House Chief of Staff, is a member of one of the families supposedly criticised by Mrs Obama. During the 1990s she worked for his father, Mayor Richard J. Daley. The current mayor of Chicago is Richard M. Daley, brother of the former Chief of Staff. The Obamas were particularly 'horrified' when Valerie Jarrett, now a close confidante of the President and First Lady, was forced out of her high-ranking job at Chicago's City Hall in 1995, according to Ms Kantor's book. Mrs Obama's hostility to Chicago's dynastic politics may help to explain Mr Daley's mysterious resignation yesterday. She is also reported to have clashed with Rahm Emanuel, Mr Daley's predecessor as Chief of Staff. 'Clear choice': Jack Lew, left, has been Mr Obama's budget director since July 2010, and also served as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton . Rahm Emanuel (2009-2010) - . Previously serving as a top adviser to President Bill Clinton, Rahm . Emanuel is no stranger to politics. He was announced as President . Obama's chief of staff two days after he was elected president. Mr . Emanuel resigned in 2010 to run for mayor of Chicago. He won that . election, and still holds the post today. William Daley (2011-2012) - . William Daley also served in the Clinton administration as the . secretary of commerce until he resigned in 2000. From there he became . chairman of Al Gore's failed presidential campaign against George W. Bush. After a stint as JPMorgan Chase's midwest chairman, he got back . into politics, becoming Mr Obama's chief of staff in January 2011. He . resigned today. Jacob Lew (2012-) - . New Yorker Jacob Lew, or Jack, has two separate stints as presidential . budget director - once under Bill Clinton and most recently under . President Obama - and deputy secretary of state under Clinton's wife . Hillary. With the departure of William Daley, he will become President . Obama's chief of staff next month. Mr Daley, 63, has previously stated . this would be his last year with the Obama administration, and would . hang on to see the president through his tough re-election bid. But today he expressed to his boss a . desire to get back to his family in Chicago, where Daleys have dominated . Windy City politics for decades. He's . the brother of recently retired Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and the . youngest son of legendary Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. Mr Obama chose Daley to be his White . House chief of staff back in January 2011, but the former banker and veteran . political fighter has had a somewhat tumultuous tenure. In the very least, the job has not seemed like the best fit for him. He was brought in to improve relations with the business community, . GOP lawmakers and others with whom he had built ties over the years. His attempts to create a ‘grand . bargain’ to solve the debt and deficit row fell apart in the face of Tea . Party hardliners, who refused to back down. In November, it was reported that Mr . Daley was handing over many of his day to day tasks to Pete Rouse, one . of Mr Obama's close allies. Despite those assertions, Mr Obama today said that Mr Daley had performed 'extraordinary work' in an 'extraordinary year'. White House officials said that to . the degree Mr Daley deserved blame for any missteps, he also deserves . credit for his work during a remarkably demanding year that ended on a . high for Obama, with a political victory over House Republicans in . getting a payroll tax cut extended. Mr Obama said: 'No . one in my administration has had to make more important decisions more . quickly than Bill. And that's why I think this decision was difficult . for me.' A Democratic strategist familiar with the decision said Mr Daley was not pushed out the door. The strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the timing was driven by Mr Daley's personal reflection, yet it also only would have gotten more awkward for the White House had he not left before Mr Obama's tone-setting State of the Union. Praise: In a speech today, President Obama applauded Mr Daley as a man who had performed 'extraordinary work' in an 'extraordinary year' Questionable departure? Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, right, denied that he resigned his post amid strained tensions with First Lady Michelle Obama, left . Mr Daley was also criticised for hurting middle . income families with the NAFTA trade deals he helped sign while serving . as Commerce Secretary under Bill Clinton between 1997 and 2000. Both Mr Daley and Mr Lew stood at Obama's side today as the president delivered brief remarks, but neither man spoke. Mr Daley replaced Rahm Emanuel, who is now Chicago's mayor. According . to a new book examining the relationship of President Obama and his . wife Michelle, Mr Emanuel departed amid strained tensions with the first . lady. The . book, titled The Obamas, mentions . several examples where Mr Emanuel tried to avoid working with Mrs Obama . after his experiences with Hillary Clinton during Bill Clinton's . tenure as president. Speaking in Chicago today, Mr Emanuel . disputed that reporting, saying, 'I’m very proud to have worked for the . president and the first lady, and [my wife] Amy and I are very proud to call them . friends.' Mr Daley served as commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton and ran Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign. Stepping . in now is the mild-mannered Lew, who began his career on Capitol Hill, . where he spent nearly a decade as principal domestic policy adviser to . the late House Speaker Tip O'Neill. Mr . Lew, 56, has worked for Obama as a deputy secretary of state before . becoming budget director, the same position he held in the Clinton . administration. Mr Lew will officially become the president's chief of staff at the end of the month.","Budget director Jack Lew to take on role in middle of re-election year .

"By . Daniel Bates . Last updated at 11:21 PM on 9th January 2012 . A producer at NBC has told of Matt Lauer's germaphobia. He allegedly uses Purell all the time after shaking fans' hands . Matt Lauer is so paranoid about germs that he uses hand sanitiser after shaking hands with the public, according to a report. The Today show host meets and greets dozens of people every day after they have arrived to watch the filming of America's most popular morning show. But after he has said hello he secretly pulls out a bottle of Purell that he keeps in his pocket at all times and applies it to his hands to get rid of any disease. Lauer's actions are likely to dishearten his legion of fans who could interpret his actions as insulting. But . according to New York magazine they are the least of his worries - he . also hates doing celebrity stories but swallows his pride and gets on . with the job. Lauer has been . the Today anchor since 1997 and is widely regarded as one of the most . trusted and dependable hosts on TV. He is also the highest paid and . earned a reported $17million last year. The report in New York Magazine is from an unnamed producer who works on Today, which is on NBC and draws around 4.75million viewers every day. The producer writes: 'Matt is known as the germophobe of the anchor team. Lauer also fears he doesn't always get enough journalistic credibility.  He is photographed left at a benefit and right interviewing Justin Bieber in November . 'He walks around with a bottle of . Purell in his pocket. He's constantly out shaking hands with the crowd, . and the minute he turns away, he's Purell-ing his hands. 'If you ever walk in his office, it's like a museum - he's meticulous.' The . producer explains how Today and ABC's Good Morning America engage in . fierce competition each morning to get the best stories. But when it comes to presenting them on-air, Lauer is not exactly enthusiastic about the celebrity material. The producer writes: 'Matt has, sort of, I don't want to describe it as highbrow, but sensitivity about his journalistic credentials. 'He only wants to go after what he perceives as really important stories. Did he want to do Kim Kardashian filing for divorce? Absolutely not. He hates the seedy, gossipy stuff—but he has to do it.' Lauer, 54, has recently the subject of speculation that he was going to be replaced on Today by E! presenter Ryan Seacrest, 37. NBC's entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt was forced to address the issue during a recent speech in which he claimed that keeping Lauer on Today was his top priority. In the article the Today producer said that if Lauer does decide to leave then he 'wouldn't be surprised if they offer him $20 million' to stay. He writes: 'The succession planning for that show is key. And Matt has been rumored to leave the show at the end of this year, when his contract is up.' Nobody from NBC was available for comment .","'He's constantly out shaking hands with the crowd, and the minute he turns away, he's Purell-ing his hands'"

He’s worth $250million and is running for the White House, but Mitt Romney is still trying to portray himself as an ordinary down-to-earth guy. The GOP presidential candidate was condemned earlier today for saying he has been worried about getting a ‘pink slip’ at least twice in the past. Now he has stunned a business audience in Nashua, New Hampshire, by telling them: 'I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. 'You know, if someone isn’t giving . the good service, I want to say, ""I’m going to go get someone else to . provide this service"",' Mr Romney said. Still smiling: GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been condemned for saying he has been worried about getting a 'pink slip' at least twice in the past . He told a chamber of commerce how . individuals should have their own health insurance, so the insurers have . an incentive to keep clients healthy. The multimillionaire was saying that people should be able to switch health insurance companies and have more options in order to get the best deal. Opponents said his statement on job termination notices was unfortunate because Mr Romney has . always had money to fall back on. ‘I know these are tough times,’ Mr Romney said. ‘I've learned what it's like to sign the front of a pay cheque, not just the back of a pay cheque. ‘And to know how frightening it is to see if you can make payroll at the end of the week.

'I know what it’s like to worry about whether you're going to get fired. There were a couple of times I wondered if I was going to get a pink slip.' Mitt Romney is leading the latest Florida GOP poll with 36 per cent - a dozen points ahead of nearest rival Newt Gingrich on 24 per cent. The Quinnipiac University survey put them ahead of Rick Santorum on 16 per cent, Ron Paul on 10 per cent, Rick Perry on 5 per cent and Jon Huntsman on 2 per cent. The Florida primary is on January 31. More than half of respondents said they could change their minds. Mr Romney is facing a mounting attack from GOP rival Newt Gingrich, who says he used his work to benefit from the losses of thousands of jobs. The former Massachusetts governor made a . fortune working at investment firm Bain Capital, which Mr Gingrich . claims ‘looted’ other companies. ‘He’s trying to identify with regular . folks but he’s seen as somebody who’s wealthy,’ New Hampshire political . expert Andy Smith told the Boston Herald. Rick Perry responded to the comments by saying Mr Romney must have been worried 'whether he was going to have enough of them to hand out'. Support: Mitt Romney, left, appeared on Sunday with Republican heavyweight New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, right, in Exeter, New Hampshire . He said in Anderson, South Carolina: 'Bain Capital - with all the jobs that they killed - I’m sure he was worried that he’d run out of pink slips.' 'I know what it’s like to worry about whether you're going to get fired. There were a couple of times I wondered if I was going to get a pink slip' Mitt Romney . His rival Jon Huntsman said: 'Governor Romney enjoys firing people - I enjoy creating jobs.' GOP voter Jerry Delemus added that Mr Romney should consider what it's like to be fired without any money to rely on. The candidate made the comments . following criticism from former House Speaker Mr Gingrich ahead of New . Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday. As soon as the lights went up in Concord, New Hampshire the other five candidates decided that they needed to take Romney down a peg or two.The feistiest by far was Newt Gingrich.

"By . James Slack . Last updated at 10:18 AM on 16th November 2011 . Former head of the UK Border Force Brodie Clark gives evidence to MPs investigating the row over UK border checks . A bombshell inquiry has found the head of the UK Border Force relaxed vital immigration checks in clear defiance of ministers because he wanted ‘quick wins’ to reduce queues at airports. A leaked draft copy of a disciplinary investigation into the conduct of Brodie Clark – who yesterday denied being a ‘rogue’ civil servant – reveals fingerprint checks on foreign nationals who need a visa to enter the UK were relaxed on 164 occasions. This was despite the Home Secretary explicitly saying that, even in ‘extremis’, this must not happen in case it allowed those from terrorist hotspots such as the Yemen to enter unchecked. Staff also casually referred to a . pilot authorised by Theresa May – which did controversially relax checks . on EU biometric passports and children travelling with their parents or . on school trips – as ‘children and chips’. But . the investigation, by former police officer David Wood, concludes Mr . Clark – who yesterday denied any wrongdoing in a dramatic appearance . before MPs – had a ‘case to answer’ that he had broken the Civil Service . Code. Had . he not resigned, this could have led to his dismissal. The report by Mr . Wood, the UK Border Agency’s head of enforcement and crime, which is . likely to be published next week, supports Mrs May’s claim that Mr Clark . had relaxed border checks without her approval. Mr Clark has said this claim was ‘wrong’ – putting Mrs May’s career on the line by implying she had misled Parliament. The internal inquiry, one of three into the scandal, paints a picture of how the civil service threw open the UK’s borders. But it is the confirmation that Mr Clark did not have approval to go further, by relaxing visa checks on non-EU nationals, that will be most significant at Westminster and be seen as vindication of David Cameron’s decision to back Mrs May. Offered 100k then trashed . The report – titled ‘formal misconduct procedures’ – makes clear that Mr Clark had been agitating since January this year for the Government to relax border controls and was looking for ‘quick wins’ to prevent chaos at airports. He initially suggested three measures: not routinely opening the  biometric chips on passports belonging to EU nationals; not routinely checking the fingerprints of foreign nationals requiring a visa and not routinely checking the documents of EU children travelling with their parents or on a school trip. Immigration Minister Damian Green’s office initially said he may be content to support the proposals but wanted more details of their impact. In April, Mr Clark was sent a response from Mrs May’s office saying neither she nor Mr Green was ‘content to agree’ to the changes. Giving evidence: Brodie Clark (facing the panel) speaking during a Home Affairs Select Committee meeting in the House of Commons, London . Suspended: Home Secretary Theresa May suspended Clark, claiming he went further than what she had agreed to, local media reported . The report then highlights an e-mail from Mr Clark to a senior official in the Border Agency which lays bare his concerns that Mrs May will not do what he wants. It says: ‘I am now very concerned about the impact of the summer pressures at the border. I am of the view that procedural changes will not be in place in time for the main pressure period. Home Secretary Theresa May leaving 10 Downing Street yesterday . ‘I have little confidence that the Home Secretary will sign-off  the changes (in time/at all) and  we seem to have lost some of  the urgency around getting this dealt with.’ A string of further emails are exchanged between Mr Clark’s office and Mrs May’s. One, dated July 19, tells Mr Clark: ‘I can confirm you do not have authorisation to go to scenario 3 (suspending fingerprint checks) in any circumstances.’ Mr Clark later asks again if he could move to ‘Level 3’ in ‘absolute extremis’. He was informed on July 26 the answer was that he could not – ‘in any circumstances’. The report goes on to detail how senior staff had informed Mr Clark that they had taken ‘additional measures’ which went beyond those authorised by ministers. On two occasions, details of these ‘additional measures’ were included in weekly reports for ministers – but they ‘remained with Brodie Clark’s Private Office’ and were not sent to Mrs May or Mr Green. The scandal was finally uncovered after a visit by John Vine, chief inspector of immigration, to Heathrow Airport. He alerted Mr Clark’s superiors, who quizzed him about what had been happening. At this point, the report says Mr Clark conceded that checks on fingerprints for those needing a visa had been suspended on 164 occasions over the past year – 156 times at Heathrow. One very senior official said he could not ‘possibly understand’ how Mr Clark believed he had the authority for his actions. The report, which is likely to be published next week, concludes that: ‘I am clear that the evidence available would have led to a  recommendation, should BC still be a civil servant, that he has a case to answer in that he has not  met the standards articulated in the various parts of the [Civil Service] Code’. It adds: ‘The Home Secretary  authorised a time limited pilot to enable Border Force to move to Level 2 checks [not checking the chips on EU passports or EU children travelling with their families or on school trips against the Warnings Index] when queues became unmanageable, and then only for the period needed. No other reductions in border controls were authorised, even in “absolute extremis”.’","Brodie Clark relaxed vital immigration checks in clear defiance of ministers because he wanted 'quick wins' to reduce queues at airports .

The heartbroken grandfather of the four children who burned to death during their mother's birthday party has left a poetic tribute at the scene. Keith Smith, 56, left the poignant message for his loved ones after they perished in an attic room at the family home in Freckleton, near Preston. The grieving man poured out his feelings following the tragic deaths of four-year-old twins Holly and Ella, two-year-old Jordan and their 19-year-old brother Reece, who died in a brave attempt to save his siblings. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Four-year-old twins Holly and Ella (pictured) lost their lives despite their brother Reece's attempt to save them and two-year-old Jordan .

Mr Smith, father of the children's inconsolable mother Michelle, addressed his note to 'Reece, Jordan, Ella, Holly.' His poem reads: 'The time here you really shone/ A short lives you had/ Now your gone [sic]. 'All my love was there to keep/ My life is broken all I do is weep.' The bereft relative signs his message, in red marker pen, 'Grandad Smith, love you forever, till we meet again'. His . tribute is propped against a white wooden fence placed outside the . Lancashire home, on which someone has written: 'Please leave a message.' Others have added: 'Your [sic] in my thoughts, sleep tight' and 'RIP'. The wall is piled with flowers and teddy bears left by friends and family in tribute to the dead children. Sobbing uncontrollably, Miss Smith returned to her converted bungalow last night accompanied by police officers, after the four children . were pronounced dead at hospital. Clutching a picture of her twin girls, all she could say was: ‘I have lost the lights of my life... Where can I turn?’ Grief: Michelle Smith visits the floral tributes left after four of her nine children died in the blaze . Investigation continues: Police confirmed there was a birthday party at the house, which remained sealed off yesterday . The full-time mother had invited . friends round for a party on Saturday night when the fire apparently . started in a loft conversion where the twins were sleeping. Revellers spilled out on to the . pavement in panic, before dialling 999 shortly before 11.30pm.

Michelle’s birthday – I feel so sorry for her. They are cracking kids . and she is a great mother.’ Police have begun an . investigation into the tragedy and said they were keeping an ‘open mind’ as . to whether there were any suspicious circumstances. Reports suggested the house had smoke alarms, but they were not working. Miss Smith’s former partner, Colin . Ostler, 42, said: ‘Michelle is in shock, she’s devastated, we all are, . but it’s not really hit her yet. She’s too upset to talk about it, the . enormity of what’s happened just hasn’t sunk in.’ Community in mourning: Tiny Ella, Jordan and Holly are believed to have only lived in the house for three months . 'All hell broke loose': Neighbours said fire crews rushed to the scene where four of the Smith family lost their lives .

Mr Ostler, who was in a relationship . with Miss Smith for nine years and had three daughters, Bethany, 11, . Jodie, ten, and Chloe, seven, with her, said Reece had died trying to save . his siblings. ‘Reece died a hero,’ he said. ‘My . three girls always stay with their mum on Friday nights and they wanted . to stay on Saturday as well. ‘Thankfully, we said no and I took them home, otherwise who knows what could have happened.’ Mr Ostler, a part-time chef from . Freckleton, added: ‘It is such a sad loss, it’s just horrendous, I can’t . get my head around it. Nobody should see their children die.’ Party: Police confirmed there was a gathering at the home which was attended by at least ten people . Big brother: Vibrant bouquets were adorned with messages to 'our best buddy and brother' Reece and a note from 'PippyJana and Grandad', saying the teenager would look after his siblings in heaven . Family friend Carolyn Milburn added: ‘It’s knocked us all for six. They were all lovely, all of them. ‘Lovely kids, well behaved, well brought up, always happy. Michelle is a good mum. She loves her kids. ‘I haven’t spoken to her yet but she and her mother, Christine, are both in a state.’ Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy, of Lancashire Police’s major investigation team, said they would be talking to a number of people who were at the house when the fire broke out. ‘We are keeping an open mind at this stage as to what happened,’ he added.

But the former House Speaker choked up and wiped away tears while recalling his late mother's struggle with depression and bipolar disease. He told mothers in Des Moines, Iowa, his focus on brain science issues stems from ‘dealing with the real problems of real people in my family’. Scroll down for video . Sadness: Newt Gingrich choked up and wiped away tears while recalling . his late mother's struggle with depression and mental illness . After showing his emotions, the Republican presidential candidate conceded that he does ‘policy much easier than I do personal’. Later in the day he showed his sensitive side again as he complained that politics was a 'vicious, negative business' and said his primary opponents were 'determined to lie'. While addressing the attack ads on him which are believed to have pushed him down the polls, Mr Gingrich insisted: 'I am committed to running a positive campaign and we have to find a way to communicate.' He told ABC News: 'I just think politics has become a really nasty, vicious, negative business and I think it’s disgusting and I think it’s dishonest. 'And I think the people who are running the ads know they are dishonest and I think a person who will do that to try to get to be President offers you no hope that they will be any good as President.' He added: 'If you are determined to be positive, and you want to beat guys who are determined to lie, how do you do it?' Emotional: He told mothers in Des Moines, Iowa, his focus on brain science issues stems from 'dealing with the real problems of real people in my family' At the mothers' meeting, Mr Gingrich admitted: ‘I get teary-eyed every time we sing . Christmas carols. My mother sang in the . choir and loved singing in the choir. ‘When I was very young she made me sing in the choir and we had pictures of me at a very young age singing in the choir.’ 'When I was very young she made me sing in the choir and we had pictures of me at a very young age singing in the choir' Newt Gingrich . The moment was reminiscent of Hillary . Rodham Clinton's tearful response to a question just before the 2008 . Democratic primary in New Hampshire. That was credited with humanising Mrs . Clinton in the eyes of voters, but she eventually lost out to President . Barack Obama as the race went on. Mr Gingrich also talked about his work . with former Nebraska senator Bob Kerrey on brain science and long-term . care for the elderly. He has fallen in recent Iowa . polls behind frontrunners Mitt Romney and Ron Paul, with the caucuses just four days away. An NBC poll put Mr Romney on 23 per cent, above Mr Paul on 21 per cent, Rick Santorum on 15 per cent and Rick Perry on 14 per cent. Mr Gingrich is behind all four of them with 13 per cent, but is still above Michele Bachmann on 6 per cent and Jon Huntsman with 2 per cent. Mother and son: Newt Gingrich is pictured with his late mother Kathleen in 1994, who died in 2003 aged 77 . At a Thanksgiving forum last month hosted by Mr Luntz, Mr Gingrich also cried - along with Rick Perry, Rick Santorum and Herman Cain. That was when he talked about a friend's son born with a rare heart condition, reported The Atlantic. Republican strategist Frank Luntz . asked him at the event in Java Joe’s Coffee House about a moment with his mother . that had changed his life. 'She . had bipolar disease and depression and she gradually acquired some . physical ailments,' Mr Gingrich said to an audience of around 100. 'That introduced me to the whole issue of quality long-term care - and that introduced me to the issue of Alzheimer's.' Mr Gingrich's mother Kathleen ‘Kit’ Gingrich died in 2003 aged 77. 'She spent 27 years as an Army wife,' Mr Gingrich said. 'I would say to her - I will do everything I can as a candidate to be worthy.'

A Missouri teenager who told authorities she wanted to know what it felt like to kill pleaded guilty to murder on Tuesday, telling a judge that she strangled her 9-year-old neighbor with her hands and then slashed her throat with a knife. Alyssa Bustamante, who will turn 18 on January 28, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and armed criminal action in the 2009 killing of Elizabeth Olten in St. Martins, a rural town just west of Jefferson City. At Tuesday's hearing, Bustamante looked down, her long brown hair covering her eyes, as the judge read out the amended charges and asked her if she understood she was giving up her right to a trial. She replied, 'yes.' Alyssa Bustamante (left), then 15, told authorities she had strangled, stabbed and buried her nine-year-old neighbor Elizabeth Olten (right) because she wanted to know what it felt like to kill . Judge Pat Joyce then asked Bustamante to describe what she did. 'I strangled her and stabbed her in the chest.' Bustamante said, looking straight at the judge. 'Did you cut her throat too?' the judge asked. 'Yes' Bustamante responded. Bustamante told the judge that she knew what she was doing at the time. Bustamante said she used a knife to . cut Elizabeth's throat and then strangled the girl with her hands. This . confession prompted a sharp, audible intake of breath from Elizabeth's . tearful mother who sat in the courtroom just a few feet away. Bustamante, who was 15 years old at . the time of the attack, had been charged with first-degree murder and . was supposed to stand trial starting Jan. 30. Instead, sentencing was set for February 6. She faces 10-30 years to life in prison. Prosecutors said Bustamante plotted Elizabeth's death, even digging two holes to be used as graves, then attended school for about a week while waiting for the right time to kill. They said Bustamante strangled Elizabeth without provocation, cut the girl's throat and stabbed her. Bustamante, who was active on social networking sites, had a YouTube account where she listed a hobby as 'killing people' and had the above photos on Facebook. She previously attempted suicide and was a cutter . The girl had been playing with Bustamante's younger half-sister, aged six, when the older girl led her into the woods. At . a November 2009 hearing, Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. David Rice . testified that she confessed to the slaying and led authorities to . Elizabeth's body. Rice testified that Bustamante said 'she wanted to . know what it felt like' to kill someone. In . June, Cole County Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce blocked prosecutors from . using part of the statement to police in her murder trial. Joyce ruled that a juvenile officer wrongly participated in the interview and 'used deceptive tactics' during the questioning. Hundreds of volunteers searched for two days for Elizabeth before her body was found. Juvenile justice officials testified that Bustamante had attempted to commit suicide in 2007 and had been receiving mental health treatment for depression and cutting herself. On a now-defunct YouTube page in her name, one of Bustamante's hobbies were listed as 'killing people'. A few weeks before the murder she tweeted: 'This is all I want in life; a reason for all this pain.'","Alyssa Bustamante, who was 15 at .

The desperate battle to save a brutally beaten boy's life was recounted in graphic testimony today by doctors who tried in vain to revive him in a Michigan hospital. Brandon Hayes, 25, stands accused of mercilessly beating Dominick Calhoun over a period of four days, before leaving the 4-year-old to die on the floor of his bedroom. Hayes has been charged with torture, murder and child abuse in the boy's death. A life cut short: Police say Dominick Calhoun, 4, died after several days of beatings at the hands of his mother's boyfriend, Brandon Hayes . Police have said that Hayes flew into a . rage after Dominick wet himself while sitting on the couch in his . mother's apartment in April 2010. The Detroit Free Press reported that several medical professionals were brought in yesterday to testify about the day Dominick was brought in. Cecilia Gingell, a nurse practitioner at Hurley Medical Center said that a doctor opened up the boy's skull to relieve pressure caused by his swelling brain, but it wasn't enough to save him. She said: '[His brain] spilled outside. We could not help.' The doctor who performed that operation, Dr Jawad Shah, also testified Monday at Hayes' murder trial, saying there was 'no hope' that the boy would pull through. Suspect: Hayes, 25, has been charged in young Dominick's beating death, which is believed to have stemmed from the four-year-old wetting his pants . Fighting back tears, Dr Shah described the boy’s injuries as 'horrendous.' Another doctor who examined the boy that day described his death as ‘the worst case I’ve seen.' Dr Gregory Dale Casey said: 'I don't think he had even an inch [on his body] that was not bruised, including the soles of his feet.' Dr Casey added: ‘I can't count how many old and new bruises we found. It was from his scalp to the soles of his feet.' Cops claim Hayes beat Dominick over a four-day period the weekend, slamming the boy into a wall several times, punching him in the genitals and burning his hand. Grieving: Dominick's grandfather Rick Calhoun, left, called police after he found the boy in his mother's apartment, brutally beaten and unconscious . History of abuse: Dominick's mother, Corrine Baker, who pleaded guilty in August to second-degree murder for not protecting her son against Hayes' alleged abuse, is expected to testify against her former boyfriend . Family members were at the boy’s bedside as doctors shut down life support on April 12, 2010. Also testifying yesterday was the boy’s grandfather, Rick Calhoun, who said he found a badly-bruised Dominick moaning on the floor of his bedroom and called police. The boy's mother, Corrine Baker, pleaded guilty in August to second-degree murder charges for not protecting her son against Hayes' alleged abuse. She is expected to testify against her former boyfriend. Hayes’ lawyer James Piazza has argued that his client is plagued by hallucinations, but a psychiatric evaluation found that he was competent to stand trial.

Republican heavyweight Chris Christie was left in tears last night after a top GOP politician who helped kick-start his political career collapsed and died in a statehouse bathroom. Alex DeCroce, 75, of Parsippany, New Jersey, served as the state Assembly GOP leader for nine years, but died at 11pm on Monday after a long and busy final day of the state’s legislative session. His death has stunned state Assembly and Senate members, with New Jersey Governor Christie describing him as a ‘dear friend, colleague and mentor’ and ‘kind, considerate and trustworthy’. Scroll down for video . Close bond: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, reflected in mirror at left, jokes with Alex DeCroce, centre, at the Morristown Diner in New Jersey in November 2009. Mr DeCroce, who helped kick-start Mr Christie's political career, died last night . Remembered: Alex DeCroce asks a question at a meeting in Trenton, New Jersey, in December 2007 . As the busy final day of the state’s legislative session was coming to a close, most lawmakers were preparing to head home for a few hours of sleep before the new session got under way. But in a matter of moments, everything changed as the Assembly and Senate members, along with their aides and other staffers, learned that Mr DeCroce had collapsed on Monday night. The Legislature wrapped up its session with a flurry of last-minute bills - and one of his final acts as the GOP leader was to accuse Democrats of casting votes for an absent member. The death threw the Legislature's reorganisation plans for Tuesday into turmoil and caused Governor Christie to delay his annual state-of-the-state address. The Assembly and Senate greatly scaled back swearing-in ceremonies for new members. Governor Christie planned to talk about Mr DeCroce at the Assembly in lieu of his scheduled address. Close: Governor Chris Christie, right, listens to Alex DeCroce in Trenton, New Jersey, in October 2011 . Well-respected: Mr DeCroce, 75, of Parsippany, New Jersey, served as the state Assembly GOP leader for nine years. He died at 11pm on Monday after a long and busy final day of the state's legislative session . Assemblyman Herb Conaway, the Legislature's only physician, attended to Mr DeCroce at the scene, but it was too late. A cause of death was not immediately known. Governor Christie, a fellow Republican and personal friend of Mr DeCroce for 20 years, confirmed the death more than two hours after Mr DeCroce was declared dead. ‘Tonight I lost a dear friend, colleague and mentor,’ Governor Christie said last night. ‘He helped to give me my start in elective politics in Morris County in 1993. ‘He was one of the most kind, considerate and trustworthy people I have ever had the pleasure to know. This is an enormous loss for our state and for me personally.’ An obviously-emotional Governor Christie returned to the capital around midnight, wearing a sport jacket over a t-shirt and loafers but no socks. Governor Christie, right, embraces Mr DeCroce. The two men had been friends for more than 20 years . Republican heavyweight: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie spoke at a campaign rally with GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in Exeter, New Hampshire, on Sunday . He was seen breaking down while embracing Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver and other politicians. ‘I’m absolutely heartbroken by this,’ Republican Senator Kevin O’Toole, of Essex, New Jersey, told NJ.com. ‘The state will miss this guy for a long time. Everybody loved him.’ 'I lost a dear friend, colleague and mentor. He was one of the most kind, considerate and trustworthy people I have ever had the pleasure to know' Chris Christie . Mr DeCroce, who lived in Parsippany-Troy Hills, served in the Assembly since 1989 and became the GOP's leader there in 2003. His district included parts of Morris and Passaic counties. His wife, Betty Lou DeCroce, is a deputy commissioner with the Department of Community Affairs. Mr DeCroce's death comes on the heels of the passing of another GOP assemblyman, Peter Biondi, on November 10 - two days after he was re-elected to an eighth term. His fellow GOP politician Jon Bramnick, like other lawmakers, said he noticed Mr DeCroce didn't seem to feel well on Monday during the marathon session. 'But there was no indication that it was the result of anything other than it being a long day,' Mr Bramnick said. 'It was 11 at night and no one was feeling too well.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:07 PM on 10th January 2012 . A Marine sergeant charged in the biggest criminal case against U.S. troops in the Iraq war made a series of fatal assumptions and lost control of himself when he and his squad killed 24 Iraqis, including unarmed women and children, a military prosecutor said Monday. Maj. Nicholas Gannon made the accusations to a jury of battle-hardened Marines hearing the case against Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, more than six years after the squad committed the killings in the town of Haditha. 'The evidence will show that none of the victims were a threat,' Gannon told jurors in his opening statement. On trial: Marine Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich arrives at the court in Camp Pendleton, California, with his lawyer Neal Puckett on Monday . Prosecutors told the military jury of four officers and four enlisted Marines that Wuterich shot indiscriminately without taking time to identify his targets after a roadside bomb exploded and killed a Marine. The prosecution has implicated Wuterich in the deaths of 19 of the 24 Iraqis killed that day, the Associated Press reports. Wuterich and another Marine fatally shot five men in a car near the site where the bomb went off, prosecutors said. Wuterich then ordered his squad to clear a nearby home with gunfire and grenades, telling them to shoot first and ask questions later, according to the prosecution. After killing men, women and children inside the first home, the Marines went to a second home, where Wuterich stood at the foot of a bed in a back bedroom, spraying a woman and children with bullets, Gannon said. Damaged: Two men survey the scene outside one of the houses in Haditha, Iraq where the Marines went on the rampage . Unarmed victim: Maliya Abdul Hamid Hassan Ali shows a photo of her brother Rasheed, who died in the raid, and his wife Hibba Abdulah who survived . The killings in Haditha on Nov. 19, 2005, are considered among the war's defining moments, further tainting America's reputation when it was already at a low point after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison. In his opening statement, Wuterich's attorney Haytham Faraj told jurors that Navy investigators, under pressure to show the Marine Corps was not covering up the massacre, brutally interrogated the other Marines in the squad for up to 14 hours and offered to drop charges against them if they testified against their squad leader. 'You have a bunch of scared Marines promised immunity who are going to tell you about things that did not happen,' Faraj said. Faraj, a retired Marine, asked jurors to apply their knowledge of the Marine Corps and combat experience when judging the case. The moment the roadside bomb exploded as depicted in the 2007 Nick Broomfield film Battle For Haditha . Another dramatic image from the film. Some observers believe the jury of combat Marines - many of whom cleared homes in Iraq - will be better equipped for the case over a civilian one in which people may not feel comfortable judging what is considered to be an appropriate reaction in the chaos of war . He said Wuterich's battalion had been . told by commanders that intelligence indicated the city was becoming a . hotbed of insurgents. After the bomb exploded, the squad . came under small arms fire when Wuterich ordered the homes to be . cleared, believing there were insurgents hiding there, Faraj said. 'We . don't believe there was a crime committed here,' Faraj said. 'It was . the unfortunate result of an attempt to do the right thing, but it . turned out to be tragic.' Wuterich is charged with nine counts of voluntary manslaughter. He has said he regretted the loss of civilian lives but believed he was operating within military combat rules. He is the last of the eight Marines initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the killings to face trial. Six had charges dropped or dismissed, and one was acquitted. People who lost relatives sit outside one of the houses that was raided . Gannon said evidence will show Wuterich 'never lost control of his squad ... but he made a series of fatal assumptions and he lost control of himself.' Gannon also showed excerpts from an interview of Wuterich by '60 Minutes' in which he said he believed none of the Marines with him went against his orders. A full investigation didn't begin until a Time magazine reporter inquired about the deaths in January 2006, two months after the incident. Retired Army Col. Gregory Watt, who led the initial probe, testified that Wuterich told him that he had instructed his squad to go into the homes firing, recalling 'I told them to shoot first, ask questions later.' 'I clearly remember that,' Watt testified. 'Sgt. Wuterich at the time was very straightforward, very professional and very forthcoming.' Watt added: 'He said that on more than one occasion as we talked through the events that transpired.' Army Lt. Col. David Mendelson, who assisted Watt in the investigation, told jurors he was surprised to hear that Wuterich had instructed his squad in that way and had acknowledged that he didn't positively identify his targets, a basic combat rule when deciding to use deadly fire. 'Those were things that clearly stood out and troubled me,' Mendelson testified. Legal experts say military prosecutors face an uphill battle trying to prove, so many years later, that Wuterich's actions were criminal. Wrangling over unaired outtakes of the 60 Minutes interview delayed the case from going to trial for years before prosecutors won the right to view the footage. Some believe the jury of combat Marines - many of whom cleared homes in Iraq like the operation Wuterich ordered - will be better equipped for the case over a civilian one in which people may not feel comfortable judging what is considered to be an appropriate reaction in the chaos of war. 'Military jurors may say, look tens of thousands of us went to war zones and didn't kill civilians, but they may also be willing to consider the fact that the individual may have been caught in the fog of war,' said former Navy officer David Glazier, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.","'The evidence will show that none of the victims were a threat'

"By . Lydia Warren and Beth Stebner . Last updated at 10:01 PM on 10th January 2012 . Following her husband's win in the 2008 presidential race, Michelle Obama wanted to stay with her daughters in Chicago rather than move to the White House, according to a new book. The Obamas, written by a New York Times journalist and released on Tuesday, also claims the First Lady was ‘alone, frightened and unsure of what to do next’ after moving to Washington, D.C. The book claims to lift the lid on the struggles the family faced following Obama's successful presidential bid, after which they were watched by everyone – not least the Secret Service. New start: The Obamas celebrate a successful presidential bid . in November 2008. After the win, Michelle Obama allegedly considered . staying in Chicago with daughters Sasha (centre right) and Malia (centre . left) Following the campaign, Michelle Obama was thinking about putting off the move to the White House, author Jodi Kantor claims. Kantor, who began reporting on the Obamas in 2007, writes: ‘Only a handful of friends and aides knew what Michelle was considering: staying behind in Chicago with her daughters for the rest of the school year while the new president moved to Washington alone.’ The First Lady planned to commute between the two cities for a year, using the time to consider schools for the couple’s daughters, Malia and Sasha. ‘She was anxious about relocating her children to a new city in the middle of the school year,’ Kantor writes. But her husband hated the idea, insisting he finally spend time with his family after years campaigning on the road. Challenges: Mrs Obama felt subdued and alone during her first few months in the White House, the book claims . Protective: She also worried about how her girls, pictured in 2008, would fare growing up in the White House . Only when Mrs Obama visited the White House . and was given a tour by her predecessor Laura Bush did she warm to the . idea, according to the book. But even then, she worried how her . daughters would cope, believing ‘a presidential race was potentially a . curse upon her children’, Kantor writes. She feared White House tourists . interrupting their play dates – and worried if she could trust other . parents to look after the girls. A few months into life at the White House, Mrs Obama ‘seemed spirited, enthusiastic, and active’, the book writes. ‘The truth, however was that the first lady was having an unhappy, difficult time in her new role.’ Fighter: The first lady persevered and now loves her role, realizing the impact it can have, the book says . She was deeply frustrated with . elements of her new life, including the fact that she could no longer . take her daughters to school functions without fear of causing a . commotion. She also struggled living away from Chicago and lost touch with friends. Former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs has apologised for insulting Michelle Obama during an explosive staff meeting recounted in Kantor's book, The Obamas. The argument erupted during a staff meeting in 2010, after Gibbs had dealt with a report that Mrs Obama had told French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy that she 'can't stand' life in the White House, that it was 'hell'. In a private meeting, Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett said Mrs. Obama was 'dissatisfied' with how he handled the situation and Gibbs shouted at Jarrett for getting involved. He reportedly swore, including once directed at Mrs. Obama. On Monday, Gibbs said: 'In any high-pressure work environment . there are occasional arguments and disagreements and that is certainly . true of the White House. I regret speaking in anger and . regret that this disagreement became so public.' The Harvard-educated lawyer also felt . the role she perceived herself filling in the White House never . materialised, and felt ignored by her husband’s advisers. 'She was stuck in a position with little definition and no clear goals,’ the book writes. She went on to acknowledge how tough life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue can be. ‘Sometimes it becomes difficult to live in what we call a bubble,’ she said, according to the book. But her outlook changed when, in April 2009, she visited London and spoke at a girls’ school – telling them that the world needed strong, female leaders. ‘We are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be,’ she had said. Watched by a sea of admiring girls, she understood for the first time what it meant to be First Lady. ‘She saw the responsibility, the impact, the potential of her role,’ Kantor writes. In the early days, the pressure to both be perfect and look perfect was always on – and her choice of eye-catching clothes raised eyebrows among advisers. She examined all of her outfits, realising that ‘everything she wore carried a meaning,’ Kantor writes. She is now known for her flawless ensembles at night and outfits bought at chain stores during for the day. New responsibilities: The first lady was at first unsure of her role, despite her glamorous reception . Next to normal: Mrs Obama had learned to dress strategically, the book says, buying clothes from high street stores to wear for everyday tasks and becoming more glamorous for evening events . ‘Everyone was waiting for a black woman to make a mistake,’ an advisor told the author. But she battled the pressure and fought against childhood obesity and defended her husband's drive to reform health care. When Michelle Obama worked in the Chicago City Hall in the early 1990s, she was 'distressed' that a small group of 'white Irish Catholic' families had such a strong grip on Illinois, Kantor writes. Mrs Obama worked for Mayor Daley between September 1991 and April 1993, according to City of Chicago personnel records. She was supposedly concerned about the power of three families: the Daleys, the Hynes and the Madigans. According to Kantor, Mrs. Obama ‘disapproved of how closely Daley held power, surrounding himself with three or four people who seemed to let few outsiders in - a concern she would echo years later with her own husband. ‘She particularly resented the way power in Illinois was locked up generation after generation by a small group of families, all white Irish Catholic - the Daleys in Chicago, the Hynes and Madigans statewide.’ Eventually, former aides say, Mrs Obama came to love her role as first lady. ‘It was natural that there would be a . period of transition when she and the family went from being a private . family in Chicago to the first family of the United States,’ former . White House deputy communications director Jen Psaki told ABC News. The book also details the battles Mrs Obama endured against her husband’s aides. It tells of a divided White House where tensions developed between Mrs Obama and then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel. Arguably . the most prominent point of contention Kantor reveals between the first . lady and Mr Emanuel was the friction over healthcare reform and Mrs . Obama’s scepticism of so-called backroom deals being cut. Mrs Obama ‘made it clear that she thought her husband needed a new team, according to her aides,’ Kantor writes. From . past sour experiences with another White House wife – former first lady . and current Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton - Mr Emanuel . tried to avoid Mrs Obama. Ms . Kantor writes that the East and West wings became so separate from each . other that some referred to the East Wing as ‘Guam – pleasant but . powerless.’ ‘Michelle and Rahm Emanuel had almost no bond,’ Ms Kantor writes, saying that from the get-go, the two were awkward. Clash of the titans:  Michelle Obama and former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel allegedly butted heads . Upheaval: Rahm Emanuel, left, offered to resign as Chief of Staff over health reform . ‘They were the president’s two spouses, in a sense, one public and official and one private and informal.’ The White House had a cold reaction to the book, calling it an 'over-dramatisation of old news' and emphasising that the first couple did not speak to the author, who last interviewed them for  magazine piece in 2009. 'The emotions, thoughts and private moments described in the book, though often seemingly ascribed to the president and first lady, reflect little more than the author's own thoughts,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. 'These secondhand accounts are staples of every administration in modern political history and often exaggerated.' The accounts are based on interviews with 30 current and former aides, though President Barack Obama and the first lady declined to be interviewed for the book.","New book claims first lady wanted to wait a year to join her husband .

A convicted murderer gunned down three members of his family before killing himself after an argument about what to feed his terminally-ill wife, police say. Paul Gilkey, 63, snapped while looking after his wife Darlene, 59, who is dying of cancer. Authorities say he wasn't getting along with his son Leroy or wife's two sisters Barbara S. Mohler and Dorothy M. Cherry, who had come over to help Darlene. An argument broke out in the small Logan, Ohio, home after Darlene's sisters fed her tea and toast after Gilkey had peeled an orange for her. Three hours after the fight began, . Gilkey walked out of the living room, where his wife was staying in a . hospital bed, and returned with a 9mm Browning handgun. Authorities say he shot dead Ms Mohler, 70, and Ms Cherry, 63. He also killed his son, Leroy Gilkey, 38, a beloved high school science teacher. During his rampage, Paul Gilkey told his step-son, Ralph E. Sowers III, 36, to leave. Mr Sowers told police his life was spared because he has children. All the while, bedridden Darlene Gilkey watched, unable to stop the violence. Family in need: Barbara Mohler, 70, (left) and Dorothy Cherry, 63, (right) had come to help their sister who was dying of cancer when Gilkey went on a rampage . Gilkey then shot himself in the chest on the front porch, according to authorities. According to The Columbus Dispatch, Gilkey was convicted of murder in 1974 in Athens County when he beat a . man to death with a fence post. He was released from prison in 1988. Beloved teacher: Leroy Gilkey, 38, was gunned down by his father . Details about that crime were not immediately available. After he fled the home, Mr Sowers called 911 and described the horrific crime in an hour-long phone call with dispatchers . First, Ms Mohler was killed by two close-range gunshots to the head. 'He tried to shoot my brother, and my . brother was hiding behind me. And then he kept telling me to ""Duck! Duck! Duck!""' Mr Sowers sobbed. Then, he said, Gilkey 'walked up to me and . held the gun over my head and squeezed the trigger, and my brother went . down on the ground,' the survivor reported. Leroy died from three close-range shots to the head and was also wounded in the hand. 'And then he walked over to my aunt . and shot her,' Mr Sowers said. Ms Cherry, the final victim, was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest and a close-range shot to the head. Mr Sowers, 36, fled the house and drove up the road seeking a cellphone signal to call for help. 'He let me leave because I have kids,' he says on the 911 call. A cousin of Paul Gilkey said Gilkey was upset about other family members being in the house. Massacre: This Ohio home was the site of a brutal rampage that left four people dead . 'They — the two sisters and his son — were staying out there, and he said he couldn't spend any time with her,' said Matthew Henderson, 45. Mr Henderson said his own wife happened to call the home immediately after the shooting and spoke with Darlene Gilkey, who said that her 63-year-old husband 'shot everybody' and then went outside. 'I said, ""What's he doing?"" (She said) ""I think he's waiting on more people to come so he could kill them,""' Mr Henderson recounted. The wife didn't say why she'd been spared, Mr Henderson said. 'I think he thought if he would kill her he would go to hell,' he said. Mr Henderson said his cousin had recently bought two or three plots at a cemetery, though it didn't seem unusual for a man whose wife had terminal cancer. He described Gilkey as unpredictable and unstable and said that he might have taken some pills and been drinking before the shooting. 'I thought what would happen is that he would wait until she passed away and then he would shoot himself,' he said. 'I didn't think he would shoot other people, I thought he would take his own life.'","Paul Gilkey, 63, was under 'a lot of pressure' caring for his wife who was dying of cancer .

"By . Thomas Durante . Last updated at 2:57 PM on 10th January 2012 . Shock: Rebecca Hains said she was told her cake's icing could be explosive . Of all the TSA regulations, this one really takes the cupcake. At least that's the view of Rebecca Hains, 35, of Massachusetts, who had the pastry confiscated before she boarded a flight in Las Vegas last month. But the Transportation Security Administration is sticking by its decision to confiscate the treat. The TSA said in its blog yesterday that the cupcake was packed in a jar filled with icing, which is considered a gel under a policy designed to secure travellers from terrorists seeking to evade detection by using explosives made of plastics, liquids or gels. The measures were put in place as a result of the failed 2006 plot in the UK to detonate liquid explosives on transatlantic airliners. The TSA said that the 1995 'Bojinka Plot' by World Trade Center bombing suspect Ramzi Yousef and 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Muhammad also played a role in the regulations. In that plot, the two planned to use liquid explosives in small containers to bomb aeroplanes bound for the U.S. Offenders: . The officer said the icing on the cake, which was in a jar as pictured, . could be classed as a gel, which are banned from flights, along with . liquids . Ms Hains, of Peabody, was blocked from taking the cupcake onto a plane last month when a TSA agent said icing in the jar exceeded amounts of gels allowed in carry-on luggage. Ms Hains has called that 'terrible logic.' She claimed she had passed through security at Boston's Logan International Airport earlier that week with two cupcakes packaged in jars that were gifts from a student. But she said the agent told her that just meant TSA agents in Boston didn't do their job. Precaution: The TSA said in its blog yesterday that the cupcake was packed in a jar filled with icing, which is considered a gel under a its policies . Ms Hains ultimately surrendered the cupcake, but said the encounter highlighted a lack of common sense by the agent and the ludicrousness of TSA policies. She said: 'It's not really about the cupcake; I can get another cupcake. It's about an encroachment on civil liberties.' The TSA said travellers can take cakes, pies and cupcakes through security checkpoints but should expect they might get additional screening. TSA blogger Bob Burns wrote: 'If something doesn't seem right, there is always the potential you won’t be able to take it through.' Passenger Rebecca Hains was flying home to Boston from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas . The saga with Ms Hains came a month after a similar incident involving the TSA, a passenger and a baked treat. Florida man Joe Maltese and his wife were surprised to find that a TSA agent allegedly helped him or herself to a slice of cake placed in his luggage by his mother-in-law during a holiday visit to New York. Speaking to MailOnline on Christmas Eve, Mr Maltese said he and his wife found that a three to four-inch piece of the cake had cleanly been cut out, but have found the humour in the situation. He said: 'I thought it was funny. I wasn’t trying to get anybody fired.'","Agency said icing could be considered a gel under liquids policy .

Me and my little sister: Katy Holmes cuddles baby Scarlet, the baby her mother delivered early so that she could meet her before she succumbs to an inoperable terminal brain tumour . A heavily pregnant mother took the heartbreaking decision to induce her child early so that her unborn daughter could meet her dying older sister. Paula Holmes, from Penwortham, near Preston, Lancashire, asked doctors to deliver baby Scarlet three weeks early to allow cancer-stricken Katy the chance to meet her little sister. Katy, 10, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour in October and as her condition deteriorated Paula and husband David were afraid she would not meet the new addition to their family. Paula said: 'The realisation that I . was pregnant and that Katy might not get to see the baby was terrifying. My consultant agreed to do it without hesitation.' And . she added: 'Katy loves Scarlet, and seems to have a special way with . her. All we have to do is put Scarlet in her arms and she starts . smiling.' Until a . few weeks before her diagnosis Katy had been a happy and healthy child, . but it was a mother's instinct that led Paula to take Katy to the family . doctor. As Paula and . David watched a normally beaming Katy receive a school certificate they . immediately noticed that something was amiss with their usually smiling . little girl. Paula added: 'Katy is the type of child who always has a smile on her face, and has a happy nature. 'But . when the headteacher gave her the certificate, she did not smile or . even flinch. She just looked sad, which was really out of character. 'My mother’s instinct sent alarm bells ringing, and I knew there was something seriously wrong. 'I . took Katy straight to the GP and said, ‘You’re going to think I’m mad, . but I am really worried as Katy isn’t smiling anymore’.' Katy first began to mention that she . had been suffering from blurred vision and headaches shortly after . starting Year Six at St Mary Magdalene's Primary School as head girl. Paula . explained: 'We have a history of headaches in the family, so did not . suspect anything abnormal. But we took Katy to the GP straight away just . in case. “The doctor thought it could be migraines, and asked us to keep a week-long diary of Katy’s headaches. Support: Katy, centre, with baby Scarlet and sister Charley, 8, from left, mother Paula, brother Craig, 19, brother Lee, 24, . dad David and sister Kelly, 27. PUPILS from Katy’s school and family and friends have been fund-raising so that she could draw up a wishlist of things she would like to do. Her requests have been modest and although it has been possible to grant them she has not been well enough to take part. Paula explains: 'St Mary Magdalene School have been absolutely fantastic, and pupils have had non-uniform days, bingo nights, cake stalls and all sorts of fund-raising events for Katy. 'Family and friends have done so much, too, and the community has really pulled together. Katy has never been extravagant, and appreciates the small things in life. 'When we asked her what she wanted more than anything, she asked to go to the Trafford Centre in Manchester to see the lights. But she wasn’t even well enough to do this. 'Other things she wanted was to go on a husky dog sleigh ride, go to the Sandcastle Water Park in Blackpool and to go to Beamish. 'She also really wanted to go to see The Lion King in London, and The Wish Foundation arranged for her to do this, but again, she was too ill and couldn’t go. 'We just hope she can recover enough to do all the things she wants to do.' “But just days later, we had the school assembly, and the lack of a smile made me head straight back to the doctors.” Katy was sent to the Royal Preston Hospital for a CT scan ordered by her GP and it came back clear. The . little girl then left for a few days on a school trip but when she . returned a teacher expressed concern that while taking a photograph of . Katy she had noticed that something didn't seem right with one of her . eyes. Paula rushed her daughter to A&E where doctors performed an MRI scan revealing a brain tumour. Further investigation revealed that the tumour was embedded in the brain stem which was why it had not appeared on the first scan. It was after the schoolgirl had been sent to the Royal Manchester Childrens' Hospital that the family were told the devastating news that because of the type of cancer and its location the tumour was inoperable and that the only course of treatment was radiotherapy. Katy was given between six and nine months to live. David said: 'It is the worst and most aggressive type of brain tumour there is.' The self-employed upholsterer added: 'To be told our daughter had it, and that it couldn’t be operated on, was the worst news we could have heard.' The family have not told Katy that the condition is terminal. Her parents have been told three times times that they should say their goodbyes but Katy has pulled through on each occasion. She is now being cared for at Derian House Children's Hospice in Chorley, Lancashire. The family are now pursuing their last hope by trying to contact Dr Charles Teo in Australia who is known for making bold medical decisions. Paula says: 'We are utterly desperate now, and need whatever help we can get. We feel totally helpless as Katy’s life ebbs away. 'Our beautiful daughter is fighting and astounding medics, so we owe it to her to do everything humanly possible to help her fight. 'If this was a war, and Katy was sent to fight, as a mother I would be right in front of her, protecting her from oncoming troops. 'It is no different now, except I don’t actually know what I can do, or how to do it.'","Loss of little Katy's smile alerted her mother to spectre of illness .

"By . Katherine Faulkner . Last updated at 2:24 AM on 11th January 2012 . Five Muslims who distributed leaflets calling for gay people to be executed have appeared in court accused of inciting hatred. One leaflet said the death penalty had been passed against all homosexuals and showed a mannequin hanging from a noose. Another showed a figure burning in a lake of fire with a list of punishments for homosexual acts. Accused: Kabir Ahmed, left, and Umar Javed, right, are on trial along with three other men accused of stirring up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation . The five defendants, all from Derby, . are the first to be prosecuted under new laws banning the stirring up of . hatred due to sexual orientation. Ihjaz Ali, 42, Razwan Javed, 28, Kabir . Ahmed, 28, Umar Javed, 38, and Mehboob Hussain, 44, were arrested . following complaints about leaflets distributed in Derby before a gay . pride parade in July 2010. The material was handed out in the street as well as posted through letterboxes. The first, called Death Penalty?, . claimed that Allah permitted the destruction of gay people and ‘the only . question is how it should be carried out’. The second, called Turn or Burn, . featured the figure in a blazing lake with the warning that the . decriminalisation of homosexuality was ‘the root of all problems’. A third, GAY – God Abhors You –told of severe punishment for homosexuals. In the dock: Mehboob Hussain, left, Razwan Javed, and Ihjaz Ali, right, all arrive at Derby Crown Court . Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, told Derby . Crown Court the pamphlets were threatening, offensive, frightening and . nasty and had been ‘designed to stir up hatred and hostility against . homosexual people’. Gay men who received the leaflets told the court they feared they had been personally targeted. One witness, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, said he was handed one leaflet in person and received . three more in the post. ‘Being a gay man, I thought it was . meant for me,’ he said. ‘I felt like I was being targeted. I thought it . meant I was going to be burned or something like that.’ Another, who received two of the . leaflets in the post, said: ‘I felt threatened. I wondered whether I . would be getting a flaming rag through my letter box.’ On trial: The five defendants are alleged to have handed out one homophobic document outside the Jamia Mosque in Derby . The jury heard that in the weeks before the gay pride parade, Ihjaz Ali approached police about staging a protest against it. Ali, who the prosecution say organised . the distribution of the leaflets, showed officers a list of slogans . intended for use on placards and literature. The slogans included ‘paedo . gays, you will pay’, ‘turn forever or burn forever’ and ‘Adam and Eve, . not Adam and Steve’. His request was refused and he was later arrested on the back of the welter of public complaints about the leaflets. Ali allegedly told the officers who questioned him that it was his duty to express laws laid down by Allah. Defendants: A sketch taken from inside the court of the five men on trial. (L-r) Ihjaz Ali, Razwan Javed, Kabir Ahmed, Mahboob Hassain and Umer Javed . Miss Cheema told the jury: ‘These five . defendants were part of a small group who distributed horrible, . threatening literature, with quotations from religious sources and . pictures, which were designed to stir up hostile feelings against . homosexual people.’ The court heard that all five . defendants accept they distributed the leaflets but deny charges of . intending to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation under . laws introduced in March 2010. The maximum penalty for the offences is seven years in jail. Ali faces four charges while Hussain . and Umar Javed are charged with two counts each. Razwan Javed and Ahmed . are charged with one count each. The trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.","One leaflet called The Death Penalty? showed image of mannequin hanging from a noose and said buggery led to hell, court hears .

"George Morris, 77, shot in leg and back as he tried to protect wife Dorothy . Couple had gone to meet Giffords last year to question support of Obama . Mr Morris is 'ultra-conservative' who refused President's visit in hospital . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:00 PM on 10th January 2012 . An elderly, former Marine who lost his wife of 54 years in the Tucson mass shootings expressed his anger at fellow victim and Congresswoman Gabbie Giffords. George Morris, 77, was shot in the leg and back in the attack just over a year ago as he tried to protect his wife from the gunman. Dorothy Morris, 76, was killed after the couple had gone to the Safeway supermarket to quiz Ms Giffords' political opinions. Mr Morris, who describes himself as 'ultra-conservative', even refused a visit from President Obama while he recovered in hospital following the shootings in Arizona. Harsh words: George Morris, 77, was wounded in the Tuscon shootings last year while his wife of 54 years Dorothy was killed . The couple had gone to the meet and greet at the grocery store to question Congresswoman's support of Obama's policies - including the health-care reform bill. Mr Morris told the Arizona Republic newspaper his opinion of Ms Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly: 'Every time I see them on TV, it makes me want to vomit.' He also blamed Mr Kelly for his wife's death, adding: 'I'd like to debate our dear captain . astronaut (and ask) why he didn't have security. My wife . would still be alive.' Mr Morris, who is a retired Marine and airline pilot, said he didn't believe Ms Giffords should still be in office. The 76-year-old had been a Democrat before becoming a staunch Republican once he retired. Honoured: Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband astronaut Mark Kelly attended a memorial vigil in Tucson, Arizona, on Sunday one year after the shootings . He had campaigned for Jesse Kelly, . the Republican who came close to defeating . Giffords in the 2010 election. Mr Morris and his wife Dorothy met while they were still in high school in Reno, Texas and were married for 54 years. 'I can tell you no man has ever loved a woman more than I loved my wife,' he said. According to the Arizona Republic, Mr Morris has since met a new partner online and was considering selling his home to move in with her. Mr Morris also said that he hoped the alleged shooter Jared Loughner was given the death sentence if found guilty. Marking the spot: A cross bearing the name of Dorothy Morris rests at a memorial across the street from the Safeway in Tucson where one year before a shooting left six dead and 13 injured . Saved: Mrs Giffords, in a red jacket and with a compress pressed to her head, is rushed to hospital last year. Doctors say her swift arrival at the hospital may have saved her life . On the brink: Rescuers work to save one of the shooting victims as a witness - her knees stained dark from kneeling in a puddle of blood - turns away . Representative Gabrielle Giffords led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance at a candlelight vigil on Sunday evening, one year after surviving the deadly shooting in Arizona. Suspect: Mr Morris said that if found guilty of the shootings he hoped Jared Lee Loughner was given the death sentence . The congresswoman - who has struggled to re-learn to walk after being shot in the head - stepped onstage to cheers from the crowd. She limped to the podium and husband Mark Kelly helped lift her left hand over her heart. After months of intensive speech therapy, Giffords recited the pledge with the audience, head held high and a smile on her face. Mr Kelly spoke at the event and said everyday heroes who emerged from the deadly shooting showed that alongside human frailty, there was also strength. He named each of the victims who died before saying the injured have shown that healing is possible. 'Those of us who survived were forever changed by that moment,' he said. Ms Giffords' only television interview occurred with ABC's Diane Sawyer nearly ten months after the shooting and showed how far she has come. Ms Giffords has captivated the nation as . she recovers. Going into Christmas week, her office had 24,880 letters . that had poured in from all over the world. Students from 428 schools mailed her get-well cards. Many well-wishers send her hand-made gifts, such as quilts, jewelry and paintings. People also send CDs with their favorite music and books with uplifting themes that they hope will cheer her up. Jared Lee Loughner, 23, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the mass shooting January 8, 2011, outside a Tucson supermarket where Ms Giffords was meeting with her constituents. He is being forcibly medicated at a federal prison facility in Missouri in an effort to make him mentally ready for trial.","George Morris, 77, shot in leg and back as he tried to protect wife Dorothy .

It’s unlikely Tony Corrente was best pleased when he landed on the ground after being knocked over in a brawl during the Baltimore Ravens v Pittsburgh Steelers NFL game last autumn. But the veteran NFL referee is now thanking the players who ended up causing him to be pushed over after he was diagnosed with throat and tongue cancer while being treated following his fall. High school social sciences teacher Tony Corrente, 60, of La Mirada, California, has now started a second round of chemotherapy since the moment when he tried to split up a scrum last September. The moment: Referee Tony Corrente tries to break up a scuffle between Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Michael Oher (74) and Pittsburgh Steelers' Ryan Mundy (29) and LaMarr Woodley on September 11 . Down: Tony Corrente, 60, of La Mirada, California, pictured on the ground, has now started a second round of chemotherapy since the moment when he tried to split up a scrum last September . ‘Getting knocked down and hurt in that Baltimore game might have saved my life,’ Mr Corrente told Sports Illustrated. ‘Had I not done anything… I probably wouldn’t have discovered this for a while.’ Mr Corrente added that after he was knocked down during the NFL game he took the drug Motrin, which thins blood. He started to cough up blood soon after, which made him see a throat specialist. He was diagnosed with cancer and soon began a seven-week programme of chemo and radiation therapy at a hospital in Houston, Texas, that saw him lose his hair, reported Sports Illustrated. But he was back working at the Baltimore Ravens v Cincinnati Bengals game on November 20 - just over two months after the incident during the Ravens game against the Steelers on September 11. At the game Mr Corrente spoke to Ravens players Michael Oher and Matt Birk, who were involved in the scrum that led to him eventually being diagnosed with cancer, reported Sports Illustrated. Official: Tony Corrente, pictured in 2008, is a veteran referee who is also a high school social sciences teacher . He told the ‘shocked’ duo that they may have actually saved his life. ‘This crazy ref was thanking them because they knocked him on his butt,’ Mr Corrente told Sports Illustrated. 'Getting knocked down and hurt in that Baltimore game might have saved my life' Tony Corrente . Mr Corrente’s most recent appearance as an official was at the New Orleans Saints v Detroit Lions game on Saturday. Two days later he started a second round of treatment, reported ABC News. He told Sports Illustrated that he felt weak after the Saints v Lions game and won’t be taking part in the rest of the NFL playoffs - but is hopeful of a comeback next season. Mr Corrente also wants to thank the Steelers players who knocked him over - Ryan Mundy and LaMarr Woodley. Doctors believe it’s likely he’ll be fit again to referee again next season. He has received tremendous support. ‘You hear it's the ""No Fun League"", or it's ""Not For Long"",’ Mr Corrente told Sports Illustrated. ‘I'll tell you what the league is - it's the ""National Family League"".’","Tony Corrente, 60, of La Mirada, California, knocked over in NFL game .

A Colombian drug lord who flooded the U.S. and Mexico with cocaine was shot dead in his own home on New Year's Eve during a police raid. Juan de Dios Usuga, wanted by the U.S. for supplying tonnes of cocaine to Mexican gangs, was leader of the powerful Urabenos cartel and had a $2.5 million bounty on his head. A team of 150 officers stormed the house, in the northwest area of Choco near the border of Panama, shortly after 6am. They had been tipped off he would be celebrating the start of 2012 there with his brother. Four of his trusted lieutenants were captured and one police officer was killed in the raid. On hearing the news, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos tweeted: 'The police put down in Choco alias Usuga, head of the Urabenos and captured various of his accomplices. What a good start to the year.' The Urabenos are one of Colombia's main gangs, along with Los Rastrojos, Los Paisas and Las Aguilas Negras. Usuga was a lieutenant of drug lord Daniel Rendon Herrera, who was captured in a 2009 raid. He had formerly been a right-wing paramilitary fighter and was also wanted for his involvement in a series of murders. Dealer: Juan de Dios Usuga supplied tonnes of cocaine to Mexican gangs as leader of the powerful Urabenos cartel . Colombia is one of the world's top producers of cocaine, and criminal gangs made up of former right-wing paramilitary groups and old cartels have become a major emerging threat to the nation of 46 million people. In November, Colombia and neighbouring Venezuela announced the capture of one of the region's most-wanted drug traffickers, who was head of the Paisas gang. While bloodshed from Colombia's long guerrilla and drug wars has dropped since a U.S.-backed offensive began more than a decade ago, bombings, murders and combat continue, mainly in Colombia's frontier areas. The decline in violence has attracted billions of dollars in foreign investment mainly to Colombia's mining and oil sectors, which has allowed the country to boost crude and coal output to historic highs.","Juan de Dios Usuga wanted by U.S. for trafficking .

Police . believe he may be in Weston-super-Mare following a sighting yesterday. Marker . also gave two guards the slip in May 1998 on an escorted visit to a swimming . pool at Abraham Moss Leisure Centre in Crumpsall, Manchester.

One woman died and at least 20 other people were seriously injured in a stampede today when around 5,000 prospective students rushed to register at a university in South Africa. Officials at the University of Johannesburg said two of the victims were fighting for their lives in hospital after being caught up in the crush at around 8am. The institution's vice-chancellor, Ihron Rensburg, said the tragedy happened as hopeful students and their parents pushed to get through the university's main gates for the chance to secure late registration for the new academic year, which starts later this month. Scroll down for video of the stampede . Evasion tactics: Students clamber over fences in a desperate bid to escape the crush as thousands surge through the gates of the University of Johannesburg this morning . Tragedy: The mother of one student hopeful was killed and at least 20 other people have been seriously hurt . Frantic: Around 5,000 prospective students had lined up outside the institution in the desperate hope of securing the remaining places for the next academic year . Addressing a press conference, he said: 'When we opened the gates this morning, the rush to get in created an unbearable crush on those at the front. 'The outcome was that there was a lady who was the front who was crushed and she passed away. 'Two other people suffered very serious injuries and we fear for their lives.' Prof Rensburg identified the dead woman as the mother of a male prospective student who came to the university today to apply for a place to study. He said: 'The situation was particularly tragic as the young man was inside the registration tent and had no idea that this had happened. 'We are offering counselling and support to those who have been affected by this.' Help at hand: Paramedics treat an injured woman among discarded clothing, shoes and litter. The full scale of situation remains unclear . Melee: Some students fall to the ground as others desperately try to make room for themselves amid the chaos . The university's security manager Roelet Hugo said several thousand students and their parents formed a long queue outside the institution's city centre campus from the early hours of this morning. He said several people were injured in the stampede after officials opened the gates to ease pressure on those stuck at the front. He said: 'At around 7.30am, we noticed a crowd outside the main entrance. 'We deployed security officers outside the campus, but those at the back started pushing forward and pushing people in front of them. We at that stage had no choice but to open the gate. 'But at that stage, it was too late for three people who were trampled.' Discarded shoes, clothing and blankets . today lay at the scene of the tragedy by the gates of the university's . Bunting Road campus in Johannesburg's central Auckland Park suburb. Meanwhile, . officials confirmed they had suspended the registration of prospective . students while they decided how best to proceed following the incident. Keen learners: Aspiring students queued for hours this morning in the hope of gaining a sought-after place for next year . Patient: Places are highly competitive, leading some critics to call for tougher raise the standards of entrance criteria . Johannesburg emergency services spokeswoman Nana Radebe said the number of people injured in the stampede had risen to 20. She added that emergency personnel would remain at the scene all day to ensure the situation remained calm. She . said: 'The situation is that there are currently three people in . critical, but stable conditions and 17 who suffered minor injuries. 'It is a hot day and we are worried that people might collapse as they wait outside to enter.' Meanwhile, paramedic spokesman Jeffrey . Wicks confirmed at least one woman was put on a ventilator at the scene . and said another eight suffered injuries. He . said: 'The full scale of the situation remains unclear, but we can . confirm that one woman remains in a critical condition after she . suffered severe head and chest trauma.' Officials said today's stampede was caused by a desperation to access limited places at South Africa's universities. Like universities in Britain, most students apply for places months in advance. However spaces on courses at some . institutions are offered at the last minute, usually to students from . poorer backgrounds who achieved well in their final school examinations. The lack of widespread internet . access and poor careers advice in rural or township areas means . thousands of prospective applicants are forced to turn up in person to . register their interest in further studies. Moving on up: Hundreds of thousands of students received the results of the country's school-leavers exams last week . Experts believe the problem is . symptomatic of a higher education system which has failed to expand . adequately to South Africans' growing demand for university places . following the end of apartheid. Before the advent of democracy in 1994, university places were limited largely to the white population and a tiny black elite. However, students from all backgrounds . are now able to apply for further studies, with many choosing to do so . in a country where poverty and unemployment remain common. Some critics argue that standards at . South African universities have fallen in recent years and suggest . entrance criteria should be raised. The . University of Johannesburg describes itself as a 'comprehensive' institution which offers courses ranging from diplomas to degrees. Last year, it received more than 85,000 applications for fewer than 12,000 places on its undergraduate courses.

"William Shemin ran across THREE battlefields amid machine gun fire to help injured soldiers . Lead his platoon to safety after higher officers were killed . Name used in National Defense bill encouraging recognition of Jewish soldiers . By . Associated Press . Last updated at 2:45 PM on 10th January 2012 . It was bravery at the highest level: William Shemin defied German machine gun fire to sprint across a World War I battlefield and pull wounded comrades to safety. Not just once, but three times. Then, with the platoon's senior soldiers wounded or killed, the 19-year-old American took over command of his unit and led it to safety, even after a bullet pierced his helmet and lodged behind an ear. Yet Mr Shemin never earned the nation's highest military citation- the Medal of Honor- many suspected this was because he was Jewish at a time when discrimination ran rampant throughout the U.S. military. Determined: Elsie Shemin-Roth has lobbied for her father, William, to be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during combat on the French battlefields of WWI . Now, nearly four decades after his death, Mr Shemin may finally get that medal, thanks to the tireless efforts of his daughter, whose long quest to see her father decorated also opens the door for other overlooked Jewish veterans of the Great War. 'A wrong has been made right here,' said Mr Shemin's daughter, 82-year-old Elsie Shemin-Roth of Labadie, Missouri, a small town about 40 miles southwest of St. Louis. Young: William Shemin enlisted at age 18, three years below the required age of 21 . Last month, President Barack Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act, which contains a tiny provision known as the William Shemin Jewish World War I Veterans Act. It provides for a Pentagon review of Jewish soldiers and sailors who may have been overlooked for the Medal of Honor simply because of their faith. Mr Shemin's daughter was the driving force behind the measure, an effort that began a decade ago when she read news accounts of a similar law that provided for review of Jews possibly denied recognition in World War II. She was horrified there was no similar mechanism for World War I veterans. So she began gathering military records, photos, commendations and firsthand accounts of her father's heroism. Eventually, she enlisted the help of her congressman and support from both U.S. senators from Missouri. Retired Army Colonel Erwin Burtnick of Baltimore, who is active in the Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A., helped get the bill passed. He also reviewed Mr Shemin's war record and will present the case on his behalf to the Pentagon. 'I believe, based upon the criteria of . World War I, the level of heroism exhibited by Sargent Shemin will rise . to the Medal of Honor,' Mr Burtnick said. At . the time, the enlistment age was 21, but Mr Shemin lied about his age . and got in at 18. A tall, strapping athlete who played semi-pro baseball . at age 15 and later played college football at Syracuse, Mr Shemin was . sent off to France. On a hot day in August 1918, he and his platoon were doing battle near a river in Burgundy. One . of his superiors, Captain Rubert Purdon, later wrote in support of a . Medal of Honor: 'With the most utter disregard for his own safety, . (Shemin) sprang from his position in his platoon trench, dashed out . across the open in full sight of the Germans, who opened and maintained a . furious burst of machine gun and rifle fire.' Mr Shemin didn't stop there. Casualties were heavy and many senior platoon leaders had been killed or . badly hurt, so the young sergeant led the group out of harm's way over . the next three days. Along . the way, a German bullet hit him in the head, went through the steel . helmet and lodged behind his left ear. Mr Shemin eventually collapsed . and was hospitalized for three months. The wound left him deaf in that . ear. His heroics did not go . unnoticed: Shemin was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the . nation's second-highest military honor. Different times: Ms Shemin-Roth believes that anti-emitism during WWI lead to his slight. In a recent Defense bill, there is even a provision named after him encouraging Jewish soldiers to be recognized after the fact . He eventually left the military, got a degree from Syracuse and started a greenhouse-and-nursery business in the Bronx, where he raised three children. Mr Shemin was satisfied with the medal . he got, his daughter recalled, and only occasionally wondered if he was . passed over for the Medal of Honor because of anti-Semitism. 'My father told me there was a lot of discrimination, but he didn't dwell on it,' she said. But once, when another soldier paid a visit, Ms Shemin-Roth was struck by something the man told her. 'He witnessed my father's actions,' she said recalling the visit 70 years later. 'He told me, “Your father never got the medal he deserved because he was a Jew.” I thought to myself how terrible that was.' Mr Shemin was 78 when he died in 1973. Crowning achievement: A decision could come by spring. If the Pentagon approves, the president would present the medal on Mr Shemin's behalf to his daughter in a White House ceremony. The new law may have arrived too late to recognize many Jewish heroes from World War I. They're all gone now — the last surviving American World War I veteran died last year. Even many of their children have died or are well into their 80s and 90s, Mr Burtnick said, making it less likely that surviving relatives will have enough documentation to prove worthiness for the Medal of Honor. So far, Mr Burtnick said, the only veteran whose case will be presented for review is William Shemin. A decision could come by spring. If the Pentagon approves, the president would present the medal on Mr Shemin's behalf to his daughter in a White House ceremony. Just the thought chokes her up. 'I try so hard to think of what my father would think of this,' she said. 'He was such a humble man. All I can see in my head is this big handsome man sitting down, tears in his eyes.'","William Shemin ran across THREE battlefields amid machine gun fire to help injured soldiers .

Security researchers say that the hi-tech 'worm' has stolen 45,000 Facebook log-ins and passwords - and that the cyber-criminals behind it may be using these to infect others, or even penetrate email accounts . A hi-tech cyber attack has stolen 45,000 user names and passwords from Facebook - mostly from customers in the UK. Researchers fear that the criminals - using the Ramnit worm, an attack often used to steal banking details and attack corporate networks - may be using these 'infected' accounts to send links to people's Facebook friends, spreading the computer 'worm' further. Clicking on links can direct Facebook users to infected websites, which download the worm into their PCs, turning them into another victim. They also say that the passwords for the 45,000 accounts could be used by the cybercriminals to break into email services. Anyone who uses the same password across several web services is at risk. Seculert estimates that 69 per cent of infected computers are in the UK. 'Worm' is a technical term for malicious software made by hackers which can spread itself without human help - making worms potentially more dangerous than viruses, which only spread through innocent-looking but infected files. Security company Seculert, which tracked the attack, says, 'Seculert has discovered . that Ramnit recently started targeting Facebook accounts with . considerable success, stealing over 45,000 Facebook login credentials . worldwide, mostly from people in the UK and France.' 'We suspect that the attackers behind . Ramnit are using the stolen credentials to log in to victims' Facebook . accounts and to transmit malicious links to their friends, thereby . helping it spread even further. I . 'Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the fact that users tend to use . the same password in various web-based services -Facebook, Gmail, Microsoft Outlook - to gain remote access to . corporate networks.' Ramnit is a hi-tech cyber attack which infects a computer in several different ways, designed to steal passwords and sensitive information. Ramnit is estimated to account for 17.3 per cent of new computer infections worldwide, according to security experts Symantec. Ramnit is estimated to account for 17.3 per cent of new computer infections worldwide, according to security experts Symante . Between September and December last year, 800,000 machines worldwide were infected with Ramnit, say the researchers. The recent infection was tracked by security company Seculert, who tracked the 'command and control' servers used to send commands to remote-control computers infected with Ramnit. Computers infected with malicious software often 'wait' for commands from the hackers who have infected them. In the case of Ramnit, the server that sends the commands is well known, 'Since the Ramnit Facebook command-and-control site is . visible and accessible it was fairly straightforward to detect that . over 45,000 Facebook login credentials have been stolen worldwide, . mostly from users in the United Kingdom and France.'","Ramnit 'worm' has stolen log-in details from users .

Italian police are trying to trace relatives of a British woman whose mummified body was found in her house five months after she was last seen alive. Susan Mount, 61, had not been seen since early August and her best friend informed police of her disappearance in October. Her body was discovered after neighbours complained of a strong smell coming from her studio apartment in Tribiano, a small village near Milan. Mystery: The mummified body of Susan Mount was found in her house in Tribiano near Milan, three months after she was reported missing . They called a popular TV show which deals with tracing missing people, who referred the call to the emergency services. Firefighters made the grim discovery . after being authorised to break in - raising questions as to why police . had not searched her flat when Miss Mount was reported missing. Miss Mount, who was originally from Morecambe, Lancashire, had moved to the studio flat in Tribiano several years ago. She had previously been married to an Italian man but the couple, who had no children together, were divorced. Police said she was single but was thought to have relatives in England. Major . Giuliano Gerbo, of the paramilitary Carabinieri police, said: 'We are . trying to trace relatives of Susan Mount who we believe live in England. 'An initial inspection would suggest that she died from natural causes around the time she was last seen alive in August. Scene: Miss Mount's body was discovered after neighbours in her apartment building complained of a strong smell coming from her studio flat . Investigation: Police are trying to trace Miss Mount's relatives in Britain . 'She was only officially reported . missing in October. But we also established that she would regularly . holiday in Egypt for long periods of time, so we did not suspect a crime . had been committed and did not seek permission to break into the flat. 'After . receiving information from neighbours about the strong smell coming . from the apartment we obtained permission from a local magistrate to . enter and we discovered her mummified body.' Emilia Ballio, Miss Mount's best friend in Italy, today recalled the last time she saw the British woman. She said: 'The last time I spoke with Susan was back on 7 August on the telephone. 'I had seen her . earlier that day and she was as happy as ever with a huge smile on her . face. It never crossed my mind that I would never see her or hear from . her again. Rural village: Miss Mount moved to her studio flat in Tribiano several years ago . 'I tried to call her a couple of times but there was no answer and so I went to the police and told them she was missing. I immediately had a bad feeling about her. 'The police said they would check it out but as she was over 18 and they did not suspect a crime there was not much they could do. 'When I said she often went on holiday to Egypt, they said she may well have gone away for a long break and they would keep it on file. 'I told them that she had not mentioned going away and if she did have something planned she would have told me, but they didn't act until her neighbours complained of the smell from the apartment.' Franco Lucente, mayor of Tribiano, said: 'I met here a couple of times just before the summer. She had come in to ask about getting married but I'm not sure if it was for her or someone else. 'We at the council would just like to express our condolences to her family and friends and also offer to cover her funeral arrangements if no relatives are found.'","Susan Mount, 61, was last seen alive in early August .

It briefly looked like the man revered by Manchester United fans as King Eric might also be aiming for the title of President. But reports that Eric Cantona was planning to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy for France’s highest office were yesterday revealed to be a stunt to highlight the work of a homeless charity. The former footballer, 45, now an actor, announced on Monday that he had written to mayors seeking their backing to run for the French presidency in May. He would have needed to secure the backing of 500 elected officials by the end of February. In . his letter he pledged to stand up for 'the millions of families who . have been forgotten' and condemned the lack of opportunities for young . people. But visitors to his website yesterday were redirected to a charity’s petition to improve housing for the poorest people in France. His website - ericantona.fr - was . re-routed directly to a charity's petition to improve housing for the . poorest people in France. Homeless campaigners the Abbé Pierre Foundation said the device had already brought them an extra 100,000 signatures for their cause. As well as becoming an Old Trafford legend, Cantona also achieved notoriety when he launched a ‘kung fu’ kick on a Crystal Palace fan during a match in 1995. Later, he told reporters, enigmatically: ‘When the seagulls follow the trawler, it’s because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea. Thank you very much.’ Scroll down for video... Gunning for the top spot: Potential French President Eric Cantona pictured on the day he signed for Manchester United, alongside then chairman Martin Edwards and manager Alex Ferguson . Spokesman Patrick Doutreligne said: 'We needed a high profile figure like Eric Cantona to bring attention to our campaign. 'The . sudden show of public support shows that housing an homelessness in a . nationwide problem that merits more attention in the presidential . campaign.' France goes to the polls in May to elect its next president and French newspapers said today that the 45-year-old would have 'stood no chance at all' of ever winning a nomination without the backing of a political party. The footballer turned actor was exposed to nationwide ridicule the last time he attempted to support a cause in 2010 by calling on French citizens to bring down the banks by withdrawing all their money. It later emerged that he had recently been paid £30,000 by a bank for a series of television adverts. In his now fake letter to mayors, he had said: 'This engagement obliged me to speak, more earnestly than usual, but also with a keen sense of my responsibility, at a time when our country faces difficult choices which will be decisive for its future.' The letter, printed in the Liberation newspaper, showed his strong feelings towards the social injustices experienced by the French nation, and by young people in general. Election candidates will compete in a first round in late April, with the two biggest vote-winners going through to a decisive second round in early May. Retired: Since he stopped playing, Cantona had a spell as captain of the French national beach football team and was named Director of Soccer at the New York Cosmos . Socialist candidate Francois Hollande is currently leading President Nicolas Sarkozy in the polls. Since retiring from football, Cantona had a spell as captain of the French national beach football team, starred in the film Looking for Eric and was named Director of Soccer at the New York Cosmos.

Surging towards the Palace fan, Cantona cleared the advertising hoardings and thrust a karate-style right foot square into his chest, then regained his balance enough to chuck a few right-handers in the direction of the 'victim' as thousands watched on, looking aghast. Simmons, a 20-year-old self-employed glazier at the time, was sentenced to seven days in jail for threatening and abusive behaviour and had his season ticket rescinded by Palace for 'breaking ground rules.' Cantona was stripped of his captaincy of the France national team, initially sentenced to jail, changed to community service on appeal, and banned from football for nine months. It was after his court hearing that Cantona gave his famous speech about seagulls and trawlers.","Manchester United legend wanted to promote work of homeless charity .

The mother-of-four is about to start her own slimming group after losing eight stone and as many dress sizes since this time last year. Mrs Powell, from Alsager, Cheshire, was a size 28 and weighed in at 19st and seven-and-a-half pounds last January. Then and now: Catherine Powell pictured (left) in December 2010 when she weighed nearly 20st and today (right) proudly showing off her new figure after dropping more than eight stone and eight dress sizes . But now the 34-year-old is a healthy size 12 after shedding eight stone four and a half pounds in 11 months. She said: 'When I look back at pictures now, I think it's quite scary, how did I let myself get like that? It was not great for my children, I was always tired. 'It got to the point where my health was really starting to suffer. If I left it any longer, it was just going to get worse. 'Last January, I was always tired, carrying around an extra eight stone. I would be always conscious of my size, but quickly make a joke at my own expense.'

Mrs Powell is now urging other women with weight problems to make a New Year resolution in the hope they can turn their lives around without surgery, crash diets or becoming, in her words, a 'gym bunny'. She joined a Slimming World class on January 18 last year and began her prolific weight loss. 'It's very life-changing and has been fantastic. It really teaches life-style changes,' said Mrs Powell, who lives with her husband Rob and their four children - Matthew, 19, Jacob, 13, Tiffany, 10, and seven-year-old Caitlin. 'It's very much eat well, everything in moderation, exercise more. 'Everyone with a weight problem will know they want to lose weight, but doing it is another matter.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 5:05 PM on 8th January 2012 . Iran has begun uranium enrichment at a new underground site well protected from possible airstrikes. The development was reported in a leading Iranian newspaper today in another show of defiance against Western pressure to rein in Tehran's nuclear program. Another newspaper quoted a senior commander of the powerful Revolutionary Guard force as saying Tehran's leadership has decided to order the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic oil route, if the country's petroleum exports are blocked. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, centre, visits the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility about 322 kilometres south of Tehran in 2008 . Revolutionary Guard ground forces also staged war games in eastern Iran in an apparent display of resolve against U.S. forces just over the border in Afghanistan. Revolutionary Guard deputy commander Ali Ashraf Nouri told the Khorasan - a daily newspaper: 'The supreme authorities have insisted that if enemies block the export of our oil, we won't allow a drop of oil to pass through the Strait of Hormuz. This is the strategy of the Islamic Republic in countering such threats.' Iranian politicians have issued similar threats in the past, but this is the strongest statement yet by a top commander in the security establishment. The latest statements are certain to fuel tensions with the U.S. and its allies, which are trying to turn up pressure on Iran with new sanctions to punish it over its disputed nuclear program. The West suspects Iran is trying to make nuclear weapons, but Iran denies this. The . United Nations has already sanctioned Iran for refusing to stop uranium . enrichment — which can produce both nuclear fuel and fissile warhead . material. Strategic route: One-sixth of the world's oil flows to market through the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf . Tehran says its nuclear program is only for energy and medical research, and refuses to halt uranium enrichment. Kayhan, another dail newspaper, which is close to Iran's ruling clerics, said Tehran has begun injecting uranium gas into sophisticated centrifuges at the Fordo facility near the holy city of Qom. 'Kayhan received reports yesterday that show Iran has begun uranium enrichment at the Fordo facility amid heightened foreign enemy threats,' it declared in a front-page report today. The newspaper's manager is a representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on all important matters of state. Iran's nuclear chief, Fereidoun Abbasi, said last night that his country will 'soon' begin enrichment at Fordo. Iran has a major uranium enrichment facility in Natanz in central Iran, where nearly 8,000 centrifuges are operating. Tehran began enrichment at Natanz in April 2006. The Fordo centrifuges, however, are reportedly more efficient. And the site better shielded from aerial attack.

But, astonishingly, a drink-driver and his 16-year-old passenger escaped from this horrendous crash with ‘miraculously light’ injuries. Fearing for public safety, police had abandoned a chase in which the car reached speeds of up to 110mph. Horrific: The stolen Ford Focus after being cut in two (rear part pictured further away) in the collision with a 4x4. No one was seriously injured . Christopher Jerman, 22, had taken the Ford Focus ‘for a spin’ after burgling his father’s house to get the keys. He was jailed for 20 months and banned from driving for three years after a court heard he had a blood-alcohol level of 106mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. The legal limit is 80mg/100ml. Jerman, of Holyhead, Anglesey, admitted burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and drink-driving in the incident last August. After taking the car from his father’s house in Holyhead, he was seen speeding, shortly before midnight, by a traffic policeman on the A55 at the Britannia Bridge. Lucky: The driver of the 4x4 Nissan Pathfinder escaped injury and his two passengers suffered only bruising . The sergeant followed as Jerman, who at one point switched off his lights, sped to 110mph in a 70mph area. After a mile, he left the dual carriageway near Bangor and headed towards the city, doing 70mph in a 40mph zone. The pursuit was abandoned and Jerman sped around a bend into a built-up area of Bangor. Simon Mills, prosecuting at  Caernarfon Crown Court, said that shortly afterwards the Ford, travelling on the wrong side of the road, hit an oncoming Nissan Pathfinder 4x4. The driver of the 4x4 escaped injury and his two passengers suffered only bruising. Sion ap Mihangel, defending, said: ‘It’s a matter of providence [Jerman] is not facing a far more serious charge.’","Christopher Jerman, 22, was jailed for 20 months and banned from driving for three years ."

If you had the odd moment of deja vu during the last series of Downton Abbey, then don’t worry – there’s a reason some of those beautiful gowns looked familiar. Despite the ITV show’s £12million budget, attentive viewers may have spotted that some of its leading ladies wore Hollywood hand-me-downs. Lavish dresses worn by stars including Catherine Zeta Jones, Emma Thompson and Uma Thurman have been recycled and given the Downton treatment to save money. Truly vintage: Lady Mary, pictured left in a blouse first worn by Emma Thompson's character Howard's End, pictured right . A red dress worn by Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Crawley, for example, was first seen on Miss Zeta Jones in the 2007 thriller Death Defying Acts. In fact the pair have shared two outfits. The second is a floral blouse first worn by Miss Thompson 20 years ago in the film Howards End. It was then passed on to Miss Zeta Jones, again in Death Defying Acts, before ending up in Lady Mary’s wardrobe. It is not the only costume shared by Zeta Jones and Dockery. The Downton actress recycles a red dress worn by the Welsh Actress in the same 2007 film opposite Guy Pearce. Continuing the trend, Dockery wears a fetching silky green dress . with sheer arms, a frock that had previously been worn by Radha . Mitchell when portraying the wife of Peter Pan author J. M. Barrie in . Finding Neverland in 2004. Oddly familiar: Cora Crawley, pictured left in an adapted dress worn by Uma Thurman's character in The Golden Bowl . And on a separate occasion, she is seen in an elaborate black choker so . distinctive that viewers remembered Monica Bellucci wearing the same . accessory in the film Brotherhood Of The Wolf almost a decade . ago. Eagle-eyed viewers also noticed that . Cora Crawley, played by Elizabeth McGovern, wore an adapted version of a . dress sported 12 years ago by Miss Thurman, in Henry James’s The Golden . Bowl. And in the first series, Laura . Carmichael’s Lady Edith Crawley wore a white dress from ITV’s 2007 . adaptation of EM Forster’s A Room With a View. According to Katie Bugg, a designer who runs Recycledmoviecostumes.com this is common practice on expensive productions to ensure budgets don't overrun. She states: 'Recycled movie costumes are gowns that often appear in one production and then go on to be used in another. 'Many . movies have very small costume budgets, which means that instead of . making all of the costumes, the designer is forced to rent costumes from . a costume house. Mirror image: Lady Edith Crawley, pictured left, in a dress worn by Elaine Cassidy's character in ITV's A Room with A View . 'Sometimes costumes are altered significantly to give it a new look, and . sometimes the dress is used as it appeared for the first time.' Downton’s costume designer Susannah . Box has previously said only a third of the show’s outfits are new. ‘We . couldn’t have done all of them – it would have cost a fortune, way over . our budget,’ she said. Tim Angel, whose costume firm Angels . provided many of Downtown Abbey’s frocks, said: ‘I would say around . two-thirds of the costumes you see in Downton are from stock and have . been used before. 'There . is nothing wrong with that. You can’t supply originals to everyone . because it would make an already expensive programme simply . unaffordable.’ Dockery is not the only actress that has been caught out by eagle-eyed viewers. Elizabeth McGovern, . who plays Cora Crawley, adorns a very similar outfit to Uma Thurman's . character in The Golden Bowl, although the gown appears to have been . altered slightly by dressmakers.

"Covert world of engineers who worked on Hexagon, the giant U.S. satellite project . In 15 years 20 satellites were launched snapping vast areas of the USSR and China . By . Associated Press . Last updated at 3:37 PM on 26th December 2011 . For more than a decade they toiled . in the strange, boxy-looking building on the hill above the municipal . airport, the building with no windows (except in the cafeteria), the . building filled with secrets. They wore protective white jumpsuits, . and had to walk through air-shower chambers before entering the . sanitized 'cleanroom' where the equipment was stored in the building in . Danbury, Connecticut. They spoke in code. Few knew the true . identity of 'the customer' they met in a smoke-filled, wood-paneled . conference room where the phone lines were scrambled. When they . traveled, they sometimes used false names, the Associated Press reports. Now declassified: An image released by the National Reconnaissance . Office shows an engineer next to a satellite control section from the . Hexagon program which brought back precise images from abroad . At one point in the 1970s there were more than 1,000 people in the Danbury area working on 'The Secret.' Though they worked long hours under intense deadlines, sometimes missing family holidays and anniversaries, they could tell no one - not even their wives and children - what they did. They were engineers, scientists, draftsmen and inventors - 'real cloak-and-dagger guys,' says Fred Marra, 78, with a hearty laugh. He is sitting in the food court at the Danbury Fair mall, where a group of retired co-workers from the former Perkin-Elmer Corp. gather for a weekly coffee. Gray-haired now and hard of hearing, they have been meeting here for 18 years. They while away a few hours nattering about golf and politics, ailments and grandchildren. But until recently, they were forbidden to speak about the greatest achievement of their professional lives. 'Ah, Hexagon,' Ed Newton says, gleefully exhaling the word that stills feels almost treasonous to utter in public. It was dubbed 'Big Bird' and it was considered the most successful space spy satellite program of the Cold War era. From . 1971 to 1986 a total of 20 satellites were launched, each containing 60 . miles of film and sophisticated cameras that orbited the earth snapping . vast, panoramic photographs of the Soviet Union, China and other . potential foes. The brains behind the project: Former Hexagon workers, from left in top row, Bob . Zarba, Fred Marra, Al Loewenstine, Al Bronico, Ed Newton, and Edmund . DeVeaux, seated at center, hold declassified documents . Old times: Fred Marra listens as Bob Zarba describes the camera on the Hexagon secret spy satellite. The men meet and chat about . their lives - but until recently were unable to talk of the secretive . work they carried out . The film was shot back through the earth's atmosphere in buckets that parachuted over the Pacific Ocean, where C-130 Air Force planes snagged them with grappling hooks. The scale, ambition and sheer . ingenuity of Hexagon KH-9 was breathtaking. The fact that 19 out of 20 . launches were successful (the final mission blew up because the booster . rockets failed) is astonishing. So too is the human tale of the 45-year-old secret that many took to their graves. Hexagon was declassified in September. Finally Marra, Newton and others can tell the world what they worked on . all those years at 'the office.' 'My name is Al Gayhart and I built spy satellites for a living,' announced the 64-year-old retired engineer to the stunned bartender in his local tavern as soon as he learned of the declassification. 'It was intensely demanding, thrilling and the greatest experience of my life,' says Gayhart, who was hired straight from college and was one of the youngest members of the Hexagon 'brotherhood.' He describes the excitement as teams . pored over hand-drawings and worked on endless technical problems, using . 'slide-rules and advanced degrees' (there were no computers), knowing . they were part of such a complicated space project. The . intensity would increase as launch deadlines loomed and on the days . when 'the customer' - the CIA and later the Air Force - came for . briefings. On at least one occasion, former President George H.W. Bush, . who was then CIA director, flew into Danbury for a tour of the plant. Engineer: Bob Zarba holds a stained photo of himself standing next to a shipping container for a spy satellite . Memories: Ed Newton, left, and Fred Marra, right, reminisce about their work throughout the 1970s. The operations were so secretive, workers were not even allowed to tell their families what they did . Though . other companies were part of the project - Eastman Kodak made the film . and Lockheed Corp. built the satellite - the cameras and optics systems . were all made at Perkin-Elmer, then the biggest employer in Danbury. 'There were many days we arrived in the dark and left in the dark,' says retired engineer Paul Brickmeier, 70. He recalls the very first briefing on Hexagon after Perkin-Elmer was awarded the top secret contract in 1966. Looking around the room at his 30 or so colleagues, Brickmeier thought, 'How on Earth is this going to be possible?' One thing that made it possible was a hiring frenzy that attracted the attention of top engineers from around the north east. Perkin-Elmer also commissioned a new 270,000-square-foot building for Hexagon — the boxy one on the hill. Waiting for clearance was a surreal experience as family members, neighbors and former employers were grilled by the FBI, and potential hires were questioned about everything from their gambling habits to their sexuality. Eyes in the skies: A film canister from the Hexagon program is parachuted to Earth before it is picked by a plane for recovery . Shrouded in secrecy: A satellite transporter near the Hexagon HQ in Danbury, Connecticut . 'They wanted to make sure we couldn't be bribed,' Marra says. Clearance could take up to a year. During that time, employees worked on relatively minor tasks in a building dubbed 'the mushroom tank' - so named because everyone was in the dark about what they had actually been hired for. Joseph Prusak, 76, spent six months . in the tank. When he was finally briefed on Hexagon, Prusak, who had . worked as an engineer on earlier civil space projects, wondered if he . had made the biggest mistake of his life. 'I . thought they were crazy,' he says. 'They envisaged a satellite that was . 60-foot long and 30,000 pounds and supplying film at speeds of 200 . inches per second. The precision and complexity blew my mind.' Several years later, after numerous successful launches, he was shown what Hexagon was capable of — an image of his own house in suburban Fairfield. 'This was light years before Google Earth,' Prusak said. 'And we could clearly see the pool in my backyard.' According to the National . Reconnaissance Office, a single Hexagon frame covered a ground distance . of 370 nautical miles, about the distance from Washington to . Cincinnati. Early Hexagons averaged 124 days in space, but as the satellites became more sophisticated, later missions lasted twice as long. Catching up: Former Hexagon program worker Edmund DeVeaux, right, discusses the project at a mall in Danbury, Connecticut. At first, some of the men thought the precise task would be impossible . Recounting: From left, Bob Zarba, Ed Newton, Fred Marra and Edmund DeVeaux remember the hours they spent on the project that became so significant - yet remained secret - during the Cold War . 'At . the height of the Cold War, our ability to receive this kind of . technical intelligence was incredible,' says space historian Dwayne . Day. 'We needed to know . what they were doing and where they were doing it, and in particular if . they were preparing to invade Western Europe. Hexagon created a . tremendous amount of stability because it meant American decision makers . were not operating in the dark.' From the outset, secrecy was a huge concern, but it was impossible to conceal the launches at Vandenberg Air Force base in California, and aviation magazines made several references to Big Bird. In 1975, a 60 Minutes television piece on space reconnaissance described an Alice in Wonderland world, where American and Soviet intelligence officials knew of each other's 'eyes in the sky' - and other nations did, too - but no one confirmed the programs or spoke about them publicly. Perkin-Elmer was considered a prized place to work, with good salaries and benefits, golf and softball leagues, lavish summer picnics (the company would hire an entire amusement park for employees and their families) and dazzling children's Christmas parties. The city's mayor, Mark Boughton, only . discovered that his father had worked on Hexagon when he was invited to . speak at an October reunion ceremony on the grounds of the former plant. His father, Donald Boughton, also a former mayor, was too ill to attend . and died a few days later. The painstaking work was carried with the aid of slide-rules and advanced degrees in the pre-computer age . 'Learning about Hexagon makes me view him completely differently,' Boughton says. 'He was more than just my Dad with the hair-trigger temper and passionate opinions about everything. He was a Cold War warrior doing something incredibly important for our nation.' For Betty Osterweis the ceremony was bittersweet, too. Not only did she learn about the mystery of her late husband's professional life. She also learned about his final moments. 'All these years,' she said, 'I had wondered what exactly had happened' on that terrible day in 1987 when she received a phone call saying her 53-year-old husband, Henry Osterweis, a contract negotiator, had suffered a heart attack on the job. At the reunion she met former co-workers who could offer some comfort that the end had been quick. Standing in the grounds of her late husband's workplace, listening to the tributes, her son and daughter and grandchildren by her side, Osterweis was overwhelmed by the enormity of it all — the sacrifice, the secrecy, the pride. 'To know that this was more than just a company selling widgets ... that he was negotiating contracts for our country's freedom and security,' she said. 'What a secret. And what a legacy.'","Covert world of engineers who worked on Hexagon, the giant U.S. satellite project .

"By . Tim Shipman . Last updated at 11:11 PM on 10th January 2012 . Ed Miliband pledged to create a fairer Britain if the party was re-elected . Ed Miliband pleaded with voters and his party not to write him off yesterday as he launched a fresh bid to win back credibility on the economy. The Labour leader insisted he has the ‘inner belief’ to win the next election. But, in a major admission, he appeared to accept that Labour would not be able to go on spending and will have to promise further cuts if it is to win power in 2015. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls went further, saying Labour ‘can make no commitment to reverse any of the Government’s tax rises or spending cuts’. With Labour trailing the Coalition in polling on the economy, he admitted: ‘I know, and Ed Miliband does, that Labour’s got a credibility issue.’ But the party’s economic policy was mired in even more confusion last night after Mr Balls blew up in an interview on Sky News when asked why Labour plans to borrow more money than the Coalition. ‘Don’t lecture me on borrowing,’ he said. Mr Miliband claimed he was prepared to make tough choices to cut the national budget deficit. But the only concrete measure he offered was to declare that he would not uprate the value of Winter Fuel Allowance in line with inflation. He then set out a wish-list that would end up costing billions of pounds – including backing a nationwide campaign to substitute a ‘living wage’ of £7.20 an hour for the minimum wage of £6.08. Mr Miliband said only Labour can deliver fairness when there's less money around and brushed off leadership criticism . The Labour leader admitted welfare . reforms were necessary but then said he was personally ‘a supporter’ of . universal benefits, which would make it impossible to cut costs by . means-testing some state handouts. In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Mr . Miliband flatly rejected the recent verdict of his policy guru Lord . Glasman, that his leadership had been ‘crap’. Ed Miliband arrives at the Oxo Tower this morning for the speech with Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeve . ‘I don’t agree with him when he says . it is all crap,’ he said, dismissing the growing chorus of criticism as . ‘noises off’ and internal ructions over his leadership as ‘the . Kremlinology of politics’. He insisted: ‘Don’t declare the result . of the race when it is not yet half run. I have a very strong inner . belief that I will win the race.’ Later, in a speech to the London . Citizens Organisation, Mr Miliband attempted to flesh out his call for a . crackdown on ‘predator’ companies such as banks, energy companies and . credit card firms. He said a Labour government would introduce legislation to ensure that energy firms gave a fair deal to the elderly. ‘To help pensioners, those energy . companies should be forced by law to guarantee to all those over 75 the . lowest tariff. It is not fair to those people that they are being ripped . off and overcharged,’ he said. ‘That is a concrete example of how you can make your society fairer in a world where there is less money.’ He also pledged to tax the banks more . heavily to keep university tuition fees capped at £6,000 a year rather . than £9,000 as at present. Chuka Umunna, the party’s business . spokesman, will make further proposals on curbing executive pay tomorrow . and Mr Balls will make a keynote speech on the economy on Saturday. But Mr Miliband’s critics refused to . give him credit for acknowledging economic reality – a full 20 months . after Labour’s former Treasury chief secretary Liam Byrne left a note . telling his ministerial successor: . ‘There’s no money left.’ Darren . Murphy, a former special adviser to leading Blairite Alan Milburn, was . quick to dismiss Mr Miliband’s performance, saying it had ‘more than a . touch of the Iain Duncan Smith about it’. Labour’s high command has been at . pains to dismiss comparisons with Mr Duncan Smith’s doomed leadership of . the Tories as ‘wide of the mark’. Lord Glasman (left) said Mr Miliband had 'no strategy, no narrative and little energy’ and denounced Ed Balls's (right) economic policies as 'all c**p' last week . Lord Glasman compounded Mr Miliband’s . problems. Cornered by a TV crew after the speech, he first said Labour’s . message was clearer. But when asked ‘Really?’ with the camera lowered, . he shrugged his shoulders and reportedly said ‘No.’ Ed . Miliband flatly rejected the verdict of his former adviser, Lord . Glasman, that his leadership had been 'crap' during a BBC Radio 4 . programme today . 'I don't agree with him when he says it is all c**p,' he said . Tory Party deputy chairman Michael . Fallon said: ‘If Ed Miliband was serious about taking tough decisions, . he’d set out a credible plan for cutting the deficit as Alistair . Darling, Alan Johnson and half the Shadow Cabinet have demanded. If he seriously accepts there’s less . money to spend, he would stop making billions of new unfunded spending . promises and instead tell us what Labour would cut. Instead, Ed Miliband . has given us another relaunch but still no credibility.’ Mr Balls warned the belt-tightening . would have to go much further. While he said the Government was cutting . ‘recklessly fast’ – choking off economic growth –Labour would still face . ‘difficult decisions’ in office. ‘We would have to have cuts in police, . we would have to have cuts in the schools budget, we would have to have . cuts in the defence budget,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s The World at One. Split: The party is said to be divided on over whether to apologise for the mistakes of the Blair and Brown years . Many people have spent months calling for David Miliband to take over Labour's crown from his brother but this morning the BBC appeared to join the debate too when it accidentally announced David Miliband's speech was 'Coming Up'. As reporters waited for Ed Miliband to take to the stage at London's Oxo Tower for his keynote speech, the Beeb flashed an alert on television screens across the nation announcing: 'Coming up: David Miliband speech'. The error will not have impressed Ed Miliband who has had a famously fractious relationship with his brother since he became Leader of the Opposition. A screen grab of the mistake was quickly tweeted following the blunder at 11.29am . Whoops: The BBC made a mistake this morning when it said that David Miliband's speech was coming up - instead of Ed Miliband's . Vowed to cap train fare rises to apply to ever fare - not just less busy routes . He said pensioners over 75 should be put on the cheapest energy tariff . Outlined a commitment to giving government contracts to firms that offer apprenticeships to tackle youth unemployment and short-termism in business investment . He is also looking at plans for a British Investment Bank to help small businesses invest and grow. He wants workers to sit on corporate remuneration committees .

Taken at exactly the same spot in a sleepy rural village, these picturesque photographs are a perfect illustration of the unusually mild British winter. Thirty years ago today, England's lowest ever temperature was recorded near Cardington, Shropshire - with the mercury falling to a staggering -26.1c (-15f). Pictures taken from the same point three decades later tell a dramatically different story - with a daytime temperature yesterday of 10.4c (51f) as the country continues to enjoy one of the mildest winters in recent memory.

A Met Office spokesman said the daytime temperature in the nearby towns of Newport and Shawbury was even warmer - 11.2c (52f) - yesterday. Bill Burrell noted the record-breaking low temperature at a weather station near Newport, on January 10, 1982, and says he remembers the day vividly. 'I had frost on my eyelashes,' the former Met Office worker recalled. 'I knew it was cold that day, but it came as quite a shock when I saw it was -26.1c. 'It had snowed the night before, but had cleared up and it was a lovely day - just bitterly, bitterly cold.'

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 7:35 PM on 10th January 2012 . Malcolm Simpson denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving, and two alternative charges of causing death by careless driving . Two men who stopped on a motorway hard shoulder to change a tyre were killed instantly when a articulated lorry crashed straight into them. Victims Philip Cawley and Thomas Southward were 'sitting ducks' when the lorry drifted into the hard shoulder of the M6, killing them instantly, Chester Crown Court heard today. Lorry driver Malcolm Simpson, 61, of Selby, Yorkshire, denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving, and two alternative charges of causing death by dangerous driving. Another lorry driver who witnessed the crash told how it was like a scene from the film Final Destination where he could see what was going to happen but was powerless to stop it. Prosecuting barrister Simon Parry said that on the morning of September 10, Mr Cawley, 39, of Ashton in Makerfield and Mr Southward, 69, of Haydock, St Helens, left their homes for what they would have imagined to have a normal day at work for them. Their job was to travel to Stoke-on-Trent and pick up some vehicles for delivery to an auction centre in Haydock. 'A flat tyre on one of the vehicles being towed started the terrible chain of events that led to their tragic deaths in quite horrific circumstances,' Mr Parry told the jury as he opened the case. They stopped their vehicles on the hard shoulder of the north bound M6 motorway near Sandbach and the two men started to change the defective wheel themselves. The pair were killed minutes later when Simpson's lorry smashed into them. Mr Parry said that one of the issues that the jury would have to determine in the case - probably the central issue - was whether the defendant had suffered any medical episode while at the wheel causing him to lose consciousness and control of the vehicle. It was claimed by the defence that he may have suffered the effects of a mini stroke. The tragic collision had been captured by a Highways Agency motorway camera and also on the on-board camera of a VOSA vehicle which was passing the scene at the time. Simpson had left Felixstowe at about 06.10am heading for Ashton-under-Lyne and stopped for breakfast on the A14 at Northamptonshire and for fuel north of Birmingham. Moments before the impact eyewitness Darren Moran was driving a HGV when he saw the defendant move out into lane three where HGVs were prohibited. The defendant suddenly corrected himself back into lane two in a jerky movement, said Mr Moran. Then he saw the defendant's lorry drift into the hard shoulder before coming back into lane one. But within a second or so the defendant was going back onto the hard shoulder, it was claimed, and Mr Moran could see the people ahead at the parked vehicles. 'He described it like the film Final Destination where he could see what was going to happen but was powerless to stop it,' Mr Parry explained. He estimated that about half of the defendant's vehicle was on the hard shoulder and that the two men were sitting ducks. 'All he could do was desperately push hard on his horn with both hands to try and get the defendant's attention,' Mr Parry added. 'The defendant neither slowed or braked and the next thing Mr Moran heard was a bang.' Chester Crown Court, where the jury heard that Philip Cawley and Thomas Southward were 'sitting ducks' when the lorry drifted into the M6 hard shoulder . The pathology evidence was that both men died instantaneously when hit. Out of respect to them and their families, Mr Parry said that he would not describe in any detail the severity of their injuries. At the scene it was claimed that the defendant said that one of the victims must have stepped into the road because he never went over 'the rumble strips'. He also said he could not move over because of a foreign vehicle behind him - but the films showed that neither claim was true, said Mr Parry. Interviewed, he said that he just felt a bang or a bump and did not know what he had hit and claimed that he had not entered the hard shoulder. But when the CCTV footage was shown to him he answered no comment. He also said that he had in the past suffered mini-strokes. 'The prosecution say quite bluntly that the idea that he suffered any kind of attack that caused him to lose control of his vehicle is a complete red herring,' said Mr Parry. 'The driving that you can so graphically see is that of a lorry driver who is either paying no attention to his driving or drifting in and out of sleep. 'That is grossly irresponsible and quite simply dangerous.' The trial, before The Recorder of Chester, Judge Elgan Edwards, continues.","It was like a scene from the film Final Destination, says witness to the crash ."
"By . Ray Massey . Last updated at 1:34 PM on 6th January 2012 . Thousands of roads are to be reclassified as too dangerous to prevent fresh Satnav chaos in the countryside. From April, ministers will hand councils the new powers to try and prevent crashes and traffic jams on unsuitable routes. Since the explosion in Satnav sales, hundreds of villages and country roads have been dogged by lorries and car drivers who follow their in car computer’s guidance to the letter. Satellite navigation systems will now tell drivers if the road is unsuitable for lorries . This means they often end up stuck in cul-de-sacs or in town or village centres that are unsuitable for large vehicles. Town halls will no longer have to apply each time to Whitehall for permission to reclassify routes. The new information will be passed on to the Satnav firms to update their software. To ram home the message, Transport Minister Norman Baker is to host a special Government  ‘sat nav summit’ in early March aimed at ending the misery caused when lorry and car drivers blindly  follow out-of-date directions from their satnavs. The changes will stop satnav systems sending lorries on shortcuts down unsuitable country lanes . Roads which were considered major routes decades ago may now be in busy built up villages and towns, said a Department of Transport spokesman. Transport minister Mr Baker said: ‘Out-of-date directions mean misdirected traffic - a scourge of local communities. It is vital highway authorities, mapping companies and satnav manufacturers work more closely together to provide drivers with accurate, up-to-date information on traffic restrictions such as narrow roads or low bridges. This will help prevent huge lorries from being sent down inappropriate roads and ensure motorists are given the best possible directions.’ A huge lorry is pictured jammed and twisted down a narrow lane, just yards from an ancient Tudor building . Roads which were considered major routes decades ago may now be in busy built up villages and towns, said a Department of Transport spokesman . Officials say the problem is exacerbated by motorists who fail to update their own satnav maps, either because they forget or are unaware they can do so. But the AA warned that the measures to reclassify roads could lead to a ‘mismatch’ of road types from one county to another which will be  ‘confusing’ for satnav mapping companies and drivers alike. The Institute of Advanced Motorists said better signs and ‘a good map’ would help more. IAM director of policy and research Neil Greig said: ‘While we welcome the ‘Satnav Summit’, high quality and consistent signposting will always be the best way to ensure that drivers get the information they require when and where they need it most.’ An articulated delivery lorry stuck in a narrow street after following directions into Colchester, Essex . 1. September 2009: A driver whose car was left teetering on the edge of a 100ft cliff after following his satnav was ordered to pay nearly £900 for driving without due care and attention. Robert Jones, 43, nearly plunged down the cliff in his BMW after obeying instructions which sent him along a steep, narrow path, in Todmorden, West Yorkshire in March 2009.2. June 2009: A 79-year old retired banker was taken the wrong way to hospital through country lanes twice by ambulance crews, due to faulty satnav devices. The 'anomaly' in the system led to Leslie Palmer enduring a 45-minute trip to accident & emergency at Royal Hampshire County Hospital both times when it should only have taken 20 minutes. But separate ambulance crews in separate vehicles told his wife of 55 years, Jean, that they had to use satnav as that was the rule.3. September 2008: A crematorium boss saw four funerals disrupted in one afternoon by lorries sent the wrong way due to out-of-date satnav information. Marjorie Joplin said the HGVs caused 'absolute chaos' after being directed down a lane to Llanelli Crematorium, in west Wales.4. April 2008: A minibus owned by a taxi firm called Streamline was left stranded after a satellite navigation system guided it into a river. The driver was on his way to collect a fare in Castle Acre, near King's Lynn, Norfolk, when he took a wrong turn into the River Nar.5. March 2008: A taxi satnav blunder left the Chelsea-supporting daughter of Earl Spencer disappointed after she was dropped off at the wrong Stamford Bridge. After being picked up from the Earl's Althorp estate near Northampton, the teenager found herself in a remote village near York, more than 200 miles away from the Blues' home. 6. December 2007: Office workers on a Christmas shopping trip to France were taken to the wrong country after a satnav error diverted their coach seven hours off course. Instead of arriving in the French city of Lille, 50 members of Cheltenham and Gloucester sports and social club were diverted 98 miles away to a village, of the same name, in Belgium, leaving them only two hours to shop after the driver corrected his mistake. 7. March 2007: A coachload of schoolchildren due to visit Hampton Court Palace were instead driven around for five hours in traffic after the driver using satnav ended up at Hampton Court, in Islington, north London. The children, aged around eight and from Orchard Lea Junior School in Fareham, Hampshire, never got to visit the attraction that day after a teacher called a halt to the trip.",Town halls wont have to apply to Whitehall anymore .
"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 3:07 PM on 10th January 2012 . Ofsted chief: Sir Michael Wilshaw said the move was a 'logical' progression . Schools are facing no-notice spot checks from Ofsted in a move which will effectively prevent teachers from 'hiding' unruly pupils from inspectors. Inspectors will start making unannounced visits later this year in a bid to get a true picture of performance in schools. The system shake-up comes less than a week after allegations surfaced claiming that some disruptive pupils are being bribed up to £100 to stay away from lessons during Ofsted inspections. All schools will face the no-notice inspections from this autumn, the new Ofsted chief announced today. Sir Michael Wilshaw said the move was a . 'logical' progression, adding that it was vital that the public had . confidence in inspections. However, school leaders warned they had 'real doubts' that the plans would . improve inspections, and raised concerns that the change had been . announced without consulting headteachers. Sir . Michael, who took up his post as chief inspector last week, said the . introduction of new guidelines for inspections provided a 'good . opportunity' to cut the notice period given to schools. He said: 'We are introducing no-notice inspections for all schools from this September, not just those that are causing concern. 'There . are a number of reasons. First of all it’s a logical progression from . the situation years ago when there was a year’s notice, then it was two . weeks, and in 2005 it went to two days. 'That’s one reason. The second is we have a new framework, which is really important, that’s just come in. 'It . provides an opportunity for inspectors to do what’s really important - . going in and inspecting quality, particularly teaching.' Under the new guidelines, inspectors no longer have to spend time going through documentation before visits, he said. No place to hide: Ofsted inspectors are to make unannounced visits to schools which will stop teachers from trying to hide unruly pupils (file photo) The launch of Ofsted’s new Parent View website means that parents do not have to be sent questionnaires before an inspection as they can give their views year round. Sir Michael added: 'There’s no reason why they can’t go in and go straight into the classroom in the first hour of the visit.' He acknowledged that it was vital that the public has 'absolute confidence in the integrity of inspections'. Last week fresh concerns were raised that some schools were attempting to trick Ofsted by using tactics such as sending weak teachers and unruly pupils home when inspectors were visiting. He said: 'We want to make sure that the public views the process as something that’s rigorous and robust and there’s no question that schools are not going to follow the rules.' He added that the 'great majority of . schools conduct themselves properly', but said if there is any sense . that a school is not, then Ofsted needs to deal with it. Model behaviour: Sir Michael said the 'great majority' of schools conducted themselves properly but added if any did not Ofsted would 'need to deal with it' (file photo) Sir Michael admitted that some schools may be wary of the change, saying: 'In my experience, anything that’s new is going to be treated with some nervousness by schools.' Once the process is established he said he believes it will be accepted. Sir Michael said he wants inspectors to spend 'as much time as possible in the classroom'. He added: 'I don’t want them to spend a huge amount of time looking at documentation, there’s too much of that, I want them to go in and observe lessons.' Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: 'We welcome moves to improve the effectiveness of inspection, but I have real doubts that no-notice inspection will accomplish this. 'Why has he announced this significant change before that important consultation with school leaders has taken place?' 'An effective inspection system is based on mutual trust and respect, not the premise that schools are trying to ""cheat"" and need to be caught out. If it is going to lead to improvement, inspection needs to be done with schools rather than used as a beating stick.' He added: 'We welcome Sir Michael’s commitment to engage with the profession to improve the effectiveness of Ofsted, but that begs the question why he has announced this significant change before that important consultation with school leaders has taken place.' Earlier this week it was claimed that disruptive pupils were being bribed up to £100 each to stay away from lessons during Ofsted inspections. Despite . having good attendance records, poorly-behaved students are being paid . to truant to prevent their schools getting bad ratings, it was alleged. Such underhand tactics are being increasingly used to trick inspectors, according to teachers. Other methods include headteachers . ‘borrowing’ outstanding staff from neighbouring schools to take lessons . while telling their own weak teachers to go off sick. Some also take . brilliant artwork on loan from other schools to impress inspectors. Ofsted has carried out about 1,500 unannounced inspections in the last 18 months of schools which were causing concern. This included a pilot of no-notice visits to schools where there were concerns about behaviour. And Sir Michael said the feedback from these inspections had been 'very, very positive'. He will formally announce the move to no-notice inspections as part of a package of reforms in a speech early next week. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: 'It is disturbing to see Ofsted change its position in a matter of days and suggests the policy has been created with an eye more to the soundbite than the evidence. 'If a school could conceal evidence of widespread failure in just two days, then the whole concept of inspection is flawed and Ofsted's protestations that it examines progress and behaviour over the long-term ring hollow.' Nansi Ellis, head of education policy at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: 'While we totally agree that teachers should be held accountable for how well they teach, tinkering with the amount of notice for inspections will not improve education for the vast majority of children and young people. 'We also remain deeply concerned about the use of the online Parent View questionnaire. 'Any survey which allows people to 'opt-in' is likely to attract more critical responses than positive ones, and this one is unlikely to reflect the education most children receive at a school.'","Move comes amid claims that disruptive pupils are being 'bribed' to stay away during inspections .

"By . Liz Hull and Anthony Bond . Last updated at 5:01 PM on 10th January 2012 . Smoke alarms in a house where four siblings were killed in a fire were not working when the tragedy occurred, firefighters revealed today. Andrew Smith, 16, followed his older brother Reece into his mother's burning house in Freckleton, near Preston as they battled to rescue four-year-old twins Holly and Ella and two-year-old Jordan. He was forced to flee the house after being blocked by thick toxic smoke pouring out of the attic bedroom where the tragic siblings were all unconscious. But 19-year-old Reece was overcome by the smoke and died alongside his young brother and sisters. Post-mortem examinations gave the cause of the four deaths as smoke inhalation. Scroll down for video . Andrew Smith, pictured with twin sisters Holly (left) and Ella, tried in vain to save his sisters who died in the fire . Close: Brave Reece Smith, left, with his father Martin. The proud father has hailed his son a hero after he tried to save his brothers and sisters from the house fire . Today Lancashire Fire Service confirmed the smoke alarms were fitted but were not working when the fire started. The family allowed the Fire Service to reveal the information in the hope other families would test their smoke alarms to avert sdimilar tragedies. The children’s grandmother Christine Smith, 57, thanked her grandson for his brave attempts to rescue his siblings. She said: 'He tried to go in but he could not go any further because of . the fire. He will have gone in after Reece. He went in to save his . siblings and they have all lost their lives but Reece would do anything . for them.' Miss Smith said both her grandsons’ actions had been very brave but each of them would 'do anything for each other'. She said: 'I think I would have done the same thing. The only thing they were thinking was to get their sisters and brother out. 'The same thing could have happened to Andrew as it did to his brother but luckily he got out. 'I would just like to thank Andrew for trying to help his sisters and brother. He was very brave like his brother.' Tragedy: Four-year-old twins Holly and Ella (pictured) lost their lives despite their brother Reece's attempt to save them and two-year-old Jordan . Chaotic scenes: Reece Smith (left), 19,ran back into the burning house to save his younger brother Jordan (right) and his little sisters . She added: 'Reece was a cracking lad, Holly was really fun and Ella was a bit of a softy.'Jordan? He was cool. At the moment I cannot see how the future will be, I am just living from day-to-day. 'At the moment I cannot say how I will remember them. Words cannot say what they meant to me.' Speaking to The Sun, Reece's father, Martin, 48, said his son was extremely brave in attempting to rescue his siblings. 'He was very close to his brothers and sisters and thought the world of them,' he said. 'He thought about everybody else . before himself and I am not surprised that he went back in to try and . save them. I'm so proud of him.' The fire broke out as the children's mother Michelle Smith was throwing a 36th birthday party at the home. The children died in an attic bedroom. Yesterday Keith Smith, 56, the heartbroken grandfather of the four children, left a poetic tribute at the scene. Wracked with pain: Grieving Keith Smith left an emotional message at the scene in honour of his adored grandchildren . Poignant: The 56-year-old expressed his feelings in a poem . Mr Smith, father of the children's  mother Michelle, addressed his note to 'Reece, Jordan, Ella, Holly.' His poem reads: 'The time here you really shone/ A short lives you had/ Now your gone [sic]. 'All my love was there to keep/ My life is broken all I do is weep.' He signs his message, in red marker pen, 'Grandad Smith, love you forever, till we meet again'. His . tribute is propped against a white wooden fence placed outside the . Lancashire home, on which someone has written: 'Please leave a message.' Others have added: 'Your [sic] in my thoughts, sleep tight' and 'RIP'. The wall is piled with flowers and teddy bears left by friends and family in tribute to the dead children. Sobbing uncontrollably, Miss Smith returned to the converted bungalow on Sunday accompanied by police officers, after the four children . were pronounced dead at hospital. Clutching a picture of her twin girls, all she could say was: ‘I have lost the lights of my life... Where can I turn?’ Grief: Michelle Smith visits the floral tributes left after four of her nine children died in the blaze . Investigation continues: Police confirmed there was a birthday party at the house, which remained sealed off yesterday . The full-time mother had invited . friends round for a party on Saturday night when the fire apparently . started in a loft conversion where the twins were sleeping. Revellers spilled out on to the . pavement in panic, before dialling 999 shortly before 11.30pm. Yesterday . other relatives described teenager Reece as a ‘hero’ after it emerged he went back . inside the house to try to rescue the three children. Miss Smith, who has three other . daughters and two sons who live elsewhere, had also stayed in the home . and had to be led to safety by firemen. She was unharmed. Miss Smith’s father . said his blood ‘turned cold’ when he heard the story on the news early yesterday. ‘I rushed down here straight away, . all the time wishing it wasn’t going to be true, but when I got here my . worst nightmare came true,’ he said. Outpouring: A teddy bear sits among piles of floral tributes outside the converted bungalow, with an envelope reading 'Angels' just visible. Other neighbours left notes expressing their sadness . ‘I’m still trying to take it all in. They were smashing kids. The last time I saw them was at Christmas.' They had moved into the house about two-and-a-half years ago and seemed very happy there. ‘I’m still in shock. It is devastating news,’ he said. Fighting back tears, he added: ‘It was . Michelle’s birthday – I feel so sorry for her. They are cracking kids . and she is a great mother.’ Police have begun an . investigation into the tragedy and said they were keeping an ‘open mind’ as . to whether there were any suspicious circumstances. Reports suggested the house had smoke alarms, but they were not working. Miss Smith’s former partner, Colin . Ostler, 42, said: ‘Michelle is in shock, she’s devastated, we all are, . but it’s not really hit her yet. She’s too upset to talk about it, the . enormity of what’s happened just hasn’t sunk in.’ Community in mourning: Tiny Ella, Jordan and Holly are believed to have only lived in the house for three months . 'All hell broke loose': Neighbours said fire crews rushed to the scene where four of the Smith family lost their lives . Shocking: The twins' grandfather said he only heard of the tragedy on the news yesterday morning . Police and fire crews were confronted . with a ‘chaotic’ scene when they arrived, with many partygoers on the . street in a distressed state. Six firemen wearing breathing apparatus went inside the property and brought out the four children. They were taken to the Royal Preston Hospital but declared dead. Mr Ostler, who was in a relationship . with Miss Smith for nine years and had three daughters, Bethany, 11, . Jodie, ten, and Chloe, seven, with her, said Reece had died trying to save . his siblings. ‘Reece died a hero,’ he said. ‘My . three girls always stay with their mum on Friday nights and they wanted . to stay on Saturday as well. ‘Thankfully, we said no and I took them home, otherwise who knows what could have happened.’ Mr Ostler, a part-time chef from . Freckleton, added: ‘It is such a sad loss, it’s just horrendous, I can’t . get my head around it. Nobody should see their children die.’ Party: Police confirmed there was a gathering at the home which was attended by at least ten people . Big brother: Vibrant bouquets were adorned with messages to 'our best buddy and brother' Reece and a note from 'PippyJana and Grandad', saying the teenager would look after his siblings in heaven . Family friend Carolyn Milburn added: ‘It’s knocked us all for six. They were all lovely, all of them. ‘Lovely kids, well behaved, well brought up, always happy. Michelle is a good mum. She loves her kids. ‘I haven’t spoken to her yet but she and her mother, Christine, are both in a state.’ Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy, of Lancashire Police’s major investigation team, said they would be talking to a number of people who were at the house when the fire broke out. ‘We are keeping an open mind at this stage as to what happened,’ he added. Tragic: Despite all four siblings being pulled from the home in Lytham Road, Freckleton, they were pronounced dead on arrival at the Royal Preston Hospital .

"By . Stephen Wright . Last updated at 2:14 PM on 4th January 2012 . Police are hoping Gary Dobson will agree to become a ‘supergrass’ and testify against fellow, un-convicted, Lawrence gang members, the Mail can reveal. Detectives believe Dobson – long regarded as one of the ‘weak links’ in the mob – might seek a deal with prosecutors and finally come clean about who else was responsible for Stephen’s death. Both Dobson and Norris were named by the Mail in 1997 as Stephen’s killers, along with Neil and Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight. Detectives believe Gary Dobson (right) might seek a deal with prosecutors and finally come clean about who else was responsible for Stephen Lawrence's (left) death . The five have never sued and last night ITV News filmed the Acourt brothers still refusing even to discuss the case. Details of the circumstances in which convicts can receive a reduced prison sentence, in return for co-operating with the authorities, are spelt out in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. Police believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic evidence in the Lawrence case, meaning their best chance of nailing the other gang members is if a new witness were to come forward – or Dobson were to become a supergrass. Acting Deputy Commissioner Cressida Dick insisted the Met was still not at 'the end of the road' in the search for the remaining killers . It is understood the possibility of Dobson co-operating has already been discussed informally by investigators. Last night the Met’s Acting Deputy Commissioner Cressida Dick said police would continue working to bring the rest of Stephen’s killers to justice. Detectives have a list of seven remaining suspects for the murder. Their most recent investigation, which coincided with a review of the original forensic evidence, whittled down 187 names of interest to just nine. The convictions of Dobson and Norris leave seven still in the frame, including the Acourts and Knight. And the Mail can also reveal that detectives: . Norris is regarded by detectives as an ‘old-school villain’ who would never snitch. But father-of-two Dobson, whose girlfriend Michelle Lines was blowing kisses to him from the public gallery during the trial, is seen as someone who might be willing to lift the lid on the identities of the other killers. Police are still not certain which member of the gang stabbed Stephen at this bus stop in Eltham, south east London, pictured . Because he pleaded not guilty at the murder trial, Dobson would have to come up with compelling new evidence, which can be corroborated, for him to have any chance of a sentence reduction. David Norris, pictured, is regarded by detectives as an 'old-school villain' who would never snitch . A well-placed source said: ‘Police would be happy to talk to Dobson. I can’t imagine he will be too happy knowing that the Acourts and Luke Knight are swanning around Eltham, while he is locked up in jail doing a long stretch.’ The source added: ‘Dobson is now a . convicted murderer, and by definition (because of his previous stance in . this case), is also a convicted liar. But there are opportunities under . SOCPA for him to receive a lower sentence if he agrees to become a . prosecution witness. ‘The . police are not allowed to offer him an inducement up front, merely point . out the existence of the legislation. He could have several years taken . off his sentence if he co-operates.’ Acting Deputy Commissioner Dick insisted the Met was still not at ‘the end of the road’ in the search for the remaining killers. She said: ‘If we get new evidence, if we have further opportunities, we will respond to that. ‘And . no doubt in the future the case will be reviewed, as other murders are . if they are unresolved. We don’t see this as the end of the road.’ Former . Detective Superintendent Jill Bailey, who recently retired, said she . thought there was a chance that the remaining killers could be brought . to justice. ‘I’m always . hopeful because there have been quite a number of cases over the years . from forensic advancements,’ she said. ‘The changing allegiance of . people who are related to a number of cases, and new information that is . reported to us. ‘So as a . detective officer involved in a number of cases that are solved many, . many years after they first occur, of course I’m hopeful.’ An extraordinary outburst from media commentator Rod Liddle almost ended the trial of Stephen Lawrence’s killers before it began. In breach of a strict court order, he wrote a provocative comment piece which risked prejudicing  the trial of Gary Dobson and  David Norris. In the article, published in The Spectator three days after the trial started, Liddle wrote: ‘Should we care about these undoubtedly violent, often criminal, certainly unpleasant white trash? That they were (and probably still are)  racists is quite beyond dispute.’ He also included details not known to the jurors concerning Norris’s previous convictions. The matter was referred to the Attorney General for contempt of court, and Liddle and The Spectator could face criminal charges.","Detectives think Dobson is one of the 'weak links' in the mob .
They think David Norris is an 'old school' criminal who won't snitch .
Believe a sixth man, possibly blond, may have been in the killer mob. Efforts to identify the suspect could feature in any fresh police probe launched as a result of the murder convictions.
Are still not certain which member of the gang stabbed Stephen.
May seek to charge Dobson’s father Stephen with perverting the course of justice, for allegedly providing him with a false alibi. He was arrested over lying to police ten years ago, but not prosecuted."
"Knox not obliged to attend any potential retrial in Italy . 'We are going to take this to the final level,' says prosecutor . By . Louise Boyle and Nick Pisa . Last updated at 10:54 AM on 5th October 2011 . The public prosecutor who oversaw the collapse of the murder case against Amanda Knox said today he would appeal against the acquittal of the American student. 'We will appeal,' said Giuliano Mignini. 'The (higher) court will decide whether to confirm the first sentence or the second sentence.' According to the Italian judicial . process, the prosecution cannot file its appeal until the court . publishes a formal explanation of its decision which is expected in a few . months. 'We will appeal,' said public prosecutor Giuliano Mignini. 'The (higher) court will decide whether to confirm the first sentence or the second sentence' Heading home: Amanda Knox arrives in London from Italy as she makes the final leg of her journey home after being acquitted of Meredith Kercher's murder . The prosecution will appeal to the Court of Cassation, Italy's highest appeals court. Murdered: Meredith Kercher was killed just eight weeks after arriving in Italy . Mr . Mignini was speaking as Knox was pictured in London after flying in on a . British Airways flight from Rome. She is on her way home to Seattle. The . Italian prosecutor has been heavily criticised for his handling of the . case and his pursuit of a murder conviction against Knox, 24, and her . former boyfriend . Raffaele Sollecito, 27. Meredith Kercher, a 21-year-old student from Coulsdon in Surrey, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in a bedroom in the house she shared with Knox and two other women. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of killing Miss Kercher in 2009. The appeals court overturned the conviction last night. During original police questioning, Knox was questioned for more . than 50 hours over four days. At one stage, she was quizzed by . dozens of police for 14 hours. She eventually named barman . Patrick Lumumba as the killer saying she vaguely remembered 'covering my ears . in the kitchen as Patrick murdered Meredith' and as a result of that he . was arrested and spent two weeks in jail before being released. At her appeal, the judge upheld a conviction against Knox for slander – for falsely accusing Mr Lumumba of carrying out the killing. Going home: Knox (pictured right) at Heathrow Airport on her way home to Seattle in the U.S. Beaming: The young American smiles as she makes her way through the airport in Rome earlier today . Knox's legal team stressed . that her 'civil rights' had been breached during the original questioning as she . had no legal representation and no official translator - she barely . spoke Italian having arrived in the country just a few weeks earlier. Appeals judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman will now write up a report on the decision within the next 90 days. It . is likely to be closely examined by prosecutors to find grounds on . which they could launch an appeal. It is unlikely to be heard until next . year. An appeal by the prosecutor would be . heard by a panel of judges in Rome who would examine paperwork from the . case and decide if there were any mistakes in the application of the law . and if it needed to be reopened. However . Knox is not obliged to attend any potential retrial and even though . Italy could in theory ask for her extradition, it is unlikely . that the United States would hand her over. Relief: Knox breaks down after being dramatically cleared of Meredith Kercher's murder . Knox's dramatic release has been widely welcomed by the U.S. media, with many journalists arguing she should never had been found guilty of Meredith Kercher's murder. Articles written in the wake of her courtroom victory have been heavily critical of the Italian prosecutors 'far-fetched' case against her. One has even compared her treatment to the Salem witch trials of 1692. Prosecutor Mr Mignini had maintained Knox and Sollecito had killed . Meredith Kercher in a bungled sex game that had gone wrong while they always insisted they were innocent. Mr Mignini said: 'Massive mistakes . were made by the experts and by the panel of judges at the appeal - this . is only the second stage. 'We are going to take this to the third and final level at the Supreme Court in Rome. 'The court found her guilty of slander - so why find her guilty of slander? Why did she commit the slander? 'She said that to save herself from the . murder charge. She named Patrick Lumumba to save herself and Sollecito . simply followed her. Wherever she goes, he goes.' Mr Mignini also suggested that Knox's . appeal should have been stopped at the very beginning because of a . comment made by an assistant judge, Massimo Zanetti. Judge . Zanetti told the court at the start of the trial:'The only thing we . know for certain is that Meredith Kercher was murdered. Mr Mignini said: 'The judge should have . pulled his assistant by the ears and said ''Hey you don’t do that''. In . my opinion it shows he was not impartial. 'At that point he should not have taken part in the appeal - this is a very serious error. You don’t say things like that. 'Then another thing that also troubles us is that we saw the experts speak twice with the defence lawyers - that is not correct. 'That is why they were so hostile towards us in the trial - they should have been impartial but instead were hostile to the prosecution.' Stoic: Meredith Kercher's mother Arline, brother Lyle and sister Stephanie at a news conference in Perugia earlier today. They said they were back to 'square one' following the acquittal of Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito . Knox and Sollecito’s appeal victory also throws up questions surrounding the conviction of Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 24, who was found guilty of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith and originally sentenced to 30 years which was reduced to 16 on appeal. In his sentencing document, judges ruled that he committed the murder 'with others'. Knox and her legal team continually questioned why Mr Mignini was allowed to carry out the prosecution after he was convicted of abuse of office. Last year he was found guilty of illegally wire tapping phone conversations between journalists and police officers during investigations. He was given a 16-month suspended prison sentence which he is appealing but was allowed to continue working as a prosecutor. The family of Meredith Kercher remain stunned by the verdict and said the search for answers goes on. Her brother Lyle, speaking at a press conference this morning, said the family was still trying to understand how a decision that 'was so certain two years ago has been so emphatically overturned'.","Knox not obliged to attend any potential retrial in Italy .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:31 AM on 11th January 2012 . Suspect: David Hedrick has been arrested in connection with an unsolved murder from 1991 . A man has been arrested for murder after his DNA was linked to a bloody crime scene - 21 years after the event. David Hedrick ran into trouble with police after evading tax on a deal to sell televisions to Disney World. Authorities took a routine genetic sample from him, and matched it to DNA found at the scene of Betty Clair Foster's 1991 murder. Hedrick, 50, is now being held without bail on suspicion of killing Ms Foster and escaping justice for the next two decades. Ms Foster, then 50, was working alone at a computer store near Casselberry, Florida on January 31 1991 when she was killed. A customer arrived at the shop in mid-afternoon and found Ms Foster dead inside the blood-spattered premises. She was found to have been stabbed several times in the neck and chest. No money had been taken from the tills or the victim's purse, and police were unable to find a motive for the killing. Although Ms Foster's father offered $5,000 for information helping the investigation, police found no new leads and stopped actively pursuing the case. However, they did find DNA belonging to someone other than the victim in blood left on the walls of the store. Victim: Betty Clair Foster was found stabbed to death in the Florida computer store where she worked . In 2007, meanwhile Hedrick sold $764,000 worth of televisions to the owner of two hotels in Walt Disney World. He charged $72,000 in sales tax, but failed to pass on that money to the authorities. In November he was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 15 years' probation. As a convicted felon, he had to provide his DNA to the police - and when they ran it through a database, it matched the samples taken from the scene of Ms Foster's death. 'Without that arrest and conviction two months ago, we would have never been able to identify Mr Hedrick,' a Seminole County policeman told local radio station WDBO. Hedrick is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.",David Hedrick linked to murder after giving DNA sample .
"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . Last updated at 11:51 AM on 15th November 2011 . Revelations: Theresa May, pictured yesterday, will face further criticism today as Brodie Clark is questioned by MPs about the Border Agency scandal . Passport checks were relaxed nearly 2,500 times at airports this summer, according to leaked UK Border Agency emails. The damning documents also reveal that thousands of passengers on private aircraft did not face passport checks at all and were not screened against the terrorist watch list. In one email, a UKBA official at Durham Tees Valley Airport raised concerns with managers, complaining: ‘We are not allowed to physically see the passengers arriving on private charter flights. It is creating a situation where we are not able to secure the borders as robustly as we would like, for no justifiable reason.’ In a leaked reply, one manager revealed that this policy was followed at airports around the country. The revelations will increase pressure on Home Secretary Theresa May, who faces criticism today as former Border Agency boss Brodie Clark is questioned by MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee. He resigned last week after Mrs May accused him of taking a pilot scheme to relax biometric passport checks on EU citizens too far by including non-EU passengers. But Mr Clark hit back, insisting he had been given permission to extend the scheme. Last night, in written answers to the committee, Mrs May admitted the pilot scheme was trialled at 28 ports and airports. The leaked emails obtained by the Labour Party reveal that level-two checks – the relaxed regime for EU nationals sanctioned by the Home Secretary – were used hundreds of times every week for the 14 weeks the scheme ran between July and November. Border farce: Passengers at Durham Tees, where controls were waived under pilot scheme which was extended too far . They show the rules were relaxed 100 times in the first week, 260 times in the sixth week and 165 times in week nine. Averaged out over 14 weeks, that would mean border staff could have abandoned full biometric passport checks 2,450 times. Questions: Brodie Clark faces MPs today . Official figures show that 2.2million British and EU nationals and more than 300,000 non-EU citizens enter the UK every week over the summer. Between 80,000 and 90,000 private flights, mostly carrying two or three passengers, arrive every year. Pilots on private flights have to file manifest information on their passengers and these details are scrutinised for security threats. But the emails reveal UKBA staff at . Durham Tees had ‘no way of checking whether the handling agent . information is correct or even if the number of people arriving on [the] . plane matches the number we have been advised’.

Kate Quinn is believed to be the only woman in Ireland to have Caudal Regression Syndrome (CRS). The rare disorder, which she discovered she had two years ago, means she has never been through puberty, had regular periods or had to buy a bra. Limbo: Kate Quinn is stuck in the body of a 12-year-old and has now gone public with her condition in the hope someone can help her . It also means her lower spine has not developed properly so she stands at just 4ft 9ins tall. Now Miss Quinn, who says she has spent her early 20s 'hiding away' and living her life in 'limbo', has appealed to experts to come up with a cure. She believes she will not be able to find love unless she becomes a 'real' woman, she told Irish Independent. The condition is thought to affect just one in 25,000 people across the world. Stuck: Kate says until her body develops into a 'real' woman she won't be able to find love . Doctors say the fact she hasn't gone through puberty is a side-effect of her condition but they cannot explain why. Caudal regression syndrome is a rare disorder where the lower spine does not develop properly. It occurs in every on in 25,000 births. The condition can lead to medical problems including partial absence of the tail bone regions to major malformation of the pelvis and spine. Severe cases mean some people are paralysed and can suffer from incontinence. Before more comprehensive medical treatment was available full amputation of the legs at the hip was performed in severe cases. It has been speculated the condition might be associated with dietary deficiencies, including a lack of folic acid. They said the fact her hormones are not working properly is not normally associated with CRS. She has been injected . with hormones for seven years in a bid to encourage her body to go into . puberty - but to no avail. Trips to the surgery every day have prevented her from being able to enroll on college courses or get a job. She told the newspaper: 'The longer it goes on, the worse you feel because at 12 or 14 you feel you might develop, but now at 25 you start wondering if it's too late and ask yourself if you'll ever develop.' Miss Quinn, from Mooncoin, Co Kilkenny, said because her body hasn't developed to the age it should be she 'kind of hides away'. She said she has been in 'limbo' since the problem began at 14. Miss Quinn hopes a doctor may come forward with a solution following the publicity.","Kate Quinn is appealing to doctors to find a cure .

"By . Beth Stebner . Last updated at 12:43 AM on 12th January 2012 . Special treatment: The hospital where Beyonce gave birth is under investigation . Beyoncé and Jay-Z kept their daughter Blue’s birth under tight security, but now the state is looking into complaints that Lenox Hospital coddled the celebrity couple while keeping other new parents from visiting their newborns. Days after baby Blue’s birth, the Health Department said that there had been at least two families that complained that the posh Lenox Hill Hospital gave out preferential treatment. Though Beyoncé and her husband denied that they spent $1.3million to rent out an entire floor of the hospital, other parents said they were put on ‘lockdown’ so the celebrity couple could come and go as they pleased. While the Health Department would not go into details, nor say who filed the complaints, parents who welcomed little ones at the hospital have been vocal about their treatment. One complaint, spokesperson Michael Moran said, was filed anonymously, while the other was from ‘a person who read about it’ in the newspapers, he told the New York Post. Neil Coulon, 39 - who is from the same Brooklyn neighbourhood as Jay-Z - said the stress of his wife Rosalyn delivering two . premature girls was tripled when Beyoncé's towering bodyguards allegedly barred him from the sixth-floor . neonatal intensive care unit. Mr . Coulon told the News that the power couple's security allegedly cleared . a waiting room of his relatives - some who drove four and a half hours . to the Manhattan hospital to see his newborn twin girls - and described . the star as treating the hospital like 'an exclusive nightclub'. 'Three times they stopped me from entering or exiting the NICU and it happened once on Friday - just . because they wanted to use the hallway,' he claimed. It has been alleged that the couple spent . $1.3million to seal off and redecorate a wing, complete . with bulletproof glass and ultra-tight security measures. Stress: Neil Coulon of Brooklyn, pictured left with his wife Rosalyn, said the presence of Beyoncé's bodyguards on the neonatal ICU is tripling their anxiety over the birth of their twin daughters, right . But a hospital spokesperson released a . statement today, saying it was 'simply not true'. 'The family is housed in an executive suite at the . hospital and is being billed the standard rate for those . accommodations. 'The family does have its own security detail on . site. However, the hospital has been and continues to be in control of . managing all security at the facility,' the spokesperson said. The new family headed home in a decked-out Mercedes Benz that Beyonce purchased several months ago. They were reportedly followed by a large cavalcade early Tuesday morning. The van has hand-stitched Italian leather seats and a full bathroom – complete with toilet, sink, and shower. Blue Ivy Carter’s new nursery is just as luxurious, with a $20,000 crib in the shape of a turn-of-the-century car. 'We have made every effort to . ensure minimal disruption to other families experiencing the births of . their own children over the past three days.' Mr Coulson wants an apology from the stars. He said he was appalled at the double standard. 'I know they spent $1.3million and I'm just a contractor from Bed-Stuy but the treatment we received was not okay. 'My wife is . just terribly upset. She had a C-section. She gave birth to twins. She . is sore. Nobody needs this. 'This is the NICU. Nobody cares if you’re a celebrity. Nobody is . star-gazing. They just want to see their children. To have that circus roll into town and ruin our parade was unpleasant.' Lenox Hill’s executive director Frank . Danza told the New York Daily News on Tuesday that he ordered an . internal probe after the complaints. Though he said additional security . measures were enforced because of the couple’s fame, he said that none . of the other parents there over the weekend reported being denied access . to their children. Doting dad: Rap artist and entrepreneur Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, was reportedly at Beyonce's side during the birth . Facing investigation: Lenox Hill Hospital is being probed by the state Health Department and is conducting an internal investigation as well . He did confirm that additional security guards were brought in and security cameras were covered in tape. The state department did not give a . time frame for the investigation, though in most cases, it is a . time-intensive procedure where doctors, nurses, and other staff are . interviewed about the complaint at hand. New parents? There has been speculation for weeks Beyonce had already given birth . The hospital could face a fine of up to several thousand dollars if found to have given preferential treatment, the News says. Father, mother, and baby were whisked . away early Tuesday morning in a $1million black Mercedes van, complete . with a shower, sink, and toilet and hand stitched Italian leather seats. Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, was by Beyonce's side during the birth, according to E! Online. A source told Beyoncé's hometown newspaper Houston Chronicle that 'mother and baby are doing fine'. The baby's middle name Ivy may be in reference to Beyoncé and Jay-Z's love of the number 4. They married on April 4, 2008, Beyoncé's latest album is called 4 and the couple have matching tattoos of the roman numeral for 4 - IV - on their wedding fingers. Beyoncé and Jay-Z were also born on September 4 and December 4 respectively. Regarding . Blue, Jay-Z has a trilogy of albums with the word in the title. The . Blueprint was released in 2001 around the time he got together with Beyoncé, The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse came out in 2002 and The . Blueprint 3 in 2009.","New York State Health Department investigating two complaints that hospital gave preferential treatment to celebrity couple .

"By . Julian Gavaghan . Last updated at 10:47 PM on 11th January 2012 . David Cameron taunted the Scottish National Party for delaying an independence vote by telling MPs today that ‘it is not a referendum they want, it's a never-endum’. The Prime Minister ratcheted up the war of words with Alex Salmond by suggesting his party are avoiding a real debate about Scotland leaving the UK because they are worried about losing it. Polls suggest that less than a third of voters north of the border would back ending the 300-year union if a referendum was held now. The SNP leader wants the vote to be held in 2014. War of words: David Cameron challenged Alex Salmond (right) to a real debate but said the SNP 'don't want to talk about the . substance' of deciding whether Scotland leaves the 300-year-old union with England . Mr Cameron, who has suggested that a . vote may only be considered legally binding by the UK Government if it . is held within 18 months, said: ‘Let's have the debate and let's keep . our country together.’ He told the House of Commons during Prime Minister’s Questions: ‘I passionately believe in the future of our United Kingdom. ‘I passionately believe we are stronger together rather than breaking apart. ‘Frankly, I am sad we are even having . this debate, because I support the United Kingdom so strongly, but we . have to respect the fact that Scotland voted for a separatist party at . the Scottish parliamentary elections. More than half of Scottish voters want to remain in the United Kingdom, according to a poll released today. Some 54 per cent of people in Scotland questioned by Ipsos Mori for the thinktank British Future said they wanted to stay in the Union - compared to just 29 per cent who backed independence. The poll, released as the Government set out its position on the terms of any referendum on independence, also showed similar majorities in both England and Wales in favour of Scotland staying in the UK. According to the survey, voters north of the border are slightly more enthusiastic about preserving the Union than people in England or Wales. Some 48 per cent of those questioned in England backed the Union, against 27 per cent who supported independence for Scotland.In Wales, 41 per cent wanted Scotland to stay in the UK, while 29 per cent said it should become independent. Support for the Union was stronger among older people, with six out of 10 over-55s wanting Scotland to stay in the UK, compared to four out of 10 of those aged 16-44. Independence for Scotland was more popular among men (32 per cent) than women (23 per cent). And middle-class professionals were more likely to want to keep the Union (53 per cent) than those in lower skilled posts (46 per cent) or unskilled jobs (44 per cent). Ipsos Mori interviewed 2,320 people across Great Britain between November 30 and December 6, including 497 in Scotland. ‘The first thing that is right to do . is to make clear the legal position about a referendum, and that is what . the Scotland Secretary (Michael Moore) has been doing. ‘We have made the offer that we will . devolve the power to hold that referendum, so a referendum can be made . in Scotland and held in Scotland. ‘Frankly, I look forward to having . the debate because I think there have been too many in the SNP who are . happy to talk about the process, but they don't want to talk about the . substance. ‘I sometimes think when I listen to them that it is not a referendum they want, it's a never-endum.’ The Prime Minister was backed by . Labour leader Ed Miliband as the two main Westminster parties joined . together in pledging to fight for Scotland to remain part of the United . Kingdom. Mr Miliband called on supporters of the Union to make a positive case for its continuation. He warned the Commons: ‘This is a . momentous decision which our children and grandchildren will have to . live with if we get it wrong.’ Mr Miliband called for immediate . cross-party talks to deal with the process of how a single-question . referendum can be held under the oversight of the Electoral Commission. But he said it was vital that . pro-Union politicians move quickly on to debating the substance of the . issues surrounding independence for Scotland. ‘We on this side of the House believe . the United Kingdom benefits the people of Scotland and the people of . the rest of the United Kingdom in equal measure,’ said the Labour . leader. ‘We are stronger together and weaker apart. ‘We must make the case for the Union - . not simply against separatism, but the positive case about the shared . benefits to us all of Scotland's part in the United Kingdom, the shared . economic interests, the shared institutions like the NHS, our defence . forces and the BBC and above all the shared values we hold together.’ Mr Miliband added: ‘We need a . serious, thoughtful and inclusive debate on what the choices are and the . benefits to Scotland of staying in the UK. ‘On this one issue, the people of our . country deserve nothing less than that serious debate about the . benefits of the United Kingdom.’ Mr Cameron responded that he was in ‘100 per cent agreement’ with his opponent. The display of unity came a day after . Mr Salmond told Westminster politicians to ‘butt out’ of the debate . over the timing and format of the referendum. Scotland's nationalist government reacted with fury yesterday to the Prime Minister's attempts to wrestle control back from First Minister Alex Salmond (pictured right) He also said the referendum would be . held in Autumn 2014 - a date that appears to have been selected so it . falls just a few weeks after the 700th anniversary of the Battle of . Bannockburn, Scotland’s most famous military victory over England, and . when Mr Salmond hopes resentment over Government spending cuts will be . at its height. Mr Salmond said he was ‘staggered’ that Westminster was seeking to close down the possibility of a third . option in a referendum. Support: Ed Miliband backed the Prime Minister over Scotland in a show of unity between the two main Westminster parties . He believes Scottish voters may be . more likely to back so-called ‘devo max’ – an extended version of . devolution that would see fiscal autonomy for Scotland but see it remain . in the UK – than full independence. His outburst followed the UK . Government's publication yesterday of a paper which argued that the . Holyrood Parliament has no power to call a poll. The consultation paper proposed that . the Westminster Parliament could make an order to devolve power to . Holyrood to stage a ballot on the single question of independence, which . could take place within the next 18 months. But Scottish National Party MP Angus . Robertson today accused Mr Cameron of following in the footsteps of . Margaret Thatcher by seeking to dictate to Scotland. ‘The Scottish Government was elected . with an overwhelming mandate to deliver an independence referendum in . the second half of the parliamentary term,’ Mr Robertson told MPs. ‘In contrast the Conservative Party has less Members of Parliament (in Scotland) than there are giant pandas in Edinburgh Zoo. ‘So why is the Prime Minister trying to emulate Margaret Thatcher by dictating to Scotland?’ Mr Cameron said it was ‘quite the opposite’ as the Government was offering Scotland the power to hold a legal referendum. He added: ‘Right across this House there is uniform belief that that needs to happen.’ Labour’s Scotland Act of 1998, which . established devolution, and was supposed to close down the question of . Scottish independence, states explicitly that the question of ‘the Union . of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England’ will remain a matter reserved . to Westminster.","PM says SNP more interested in talking about 'process' than 'substance'

"By . Beth Stebner . Last updated at 5:32 AM on 12th January 2012 . The ticket to Europe may say nonstop, but the flight may not be, thanks in part to a supercharged Jetstream across the Atlantic. Carriers like Continental Airlines have been making unscheduled pit stops as they fly west - in fact, every 43 out of 1,100 flights were diverted in December in Boeing 757 aircrafts, reports say. A year ago, that number was only 12. But weather patterns aren’t the only culprit - the airline has been using the smaller jet to fly to and from Europe in an attempt to cut costs. Fighting the headwinds: Continental has made unannounced landings in four per cent of its December flights in order to refuel . United Continental Holdings – which operates both United and Continental after their 2010 merger – said the headwinds this December have been incredibly strong, in part due to La Niña. The winds typically averaged 28 mph ten years ago, but are now nearly double that, the strongest it’s been in ten years. But the unscheduled landings are tied up in the company’s enthusiastic use of the smaller, single-aisle 757 rather than larger models, which take up more fuel but also have bigger tanks and range. Smaller planes also mean fewer flight attendants. But the result is toying with the plane’s limits, the Wall Street Journal reports. Boeing 757s have a nautical range of around 4,000 miles, which pushes the boundary on most transcontinental flights, especially when strong headwinds eat up more of the plane’s fuel reserves. Pilots have made landings in Canada, Nova Scotia, Ireland, Iceland, and elsewhere to refuel their aircraft, a safer bet than eating into fuel reserves. By law, pilots must have enough fuel to fly the plane for an additional 45 minutes past its planned destination. Waiting game: Refueling the 757s means longer wait times and possibly missing connecting flights . The remote Goose Bay and Gander airports in Canada remain the most popular refuelling locations. While refilling the aircraft typically takes 45 minutes to an hour to complete, it can cost those on tight travelling schedules days after missed connections. A typical nonstop flight from London to . Newark, New Jersey now takes around eight and a half hours, as opposed . to seven hours in the opposite direction. While there’s little to be done about unpredictable weather patterns, travellers can use several tricks to better their chances a flight won’t make an unannounced pit stop. The best way is by checking the plane model. Airlines often show seat maps during ticket purchasing. This often reveals if the aircraft used will be a 757 (with one aisle) or a larger carrier with two aisles. The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday in a statement that it is ‘aware that United Airlines aircraft have made more unscheduled fuel stops this year than last year and we are looking into the issue.’ While the choice makes more business sense to an industry that has witnessed very real and severe financial changes and skyrocketing fuel prices, it has been nothing but a headache to the thousands of travellers forced to make other plans as their nonstop flights have been delayed by hours at a time. A spokesman for the company said that when the situation warrants it, passengers are compensated for the inconvenience. Using smaller aircraft works when the weather is docile, but this particular weather pattern is unpredictable, making the use of 757s for nonstop flights a gamble. Meteorologists are unsure how long this one will last. United/Continental spokesperson Megan McCarthy said that the headwinds have been a ‘once in ten year extreme.’ The scenic route: Some Continental flights returning from Europe stop at Canada's remote Gander Airport to refuel . She told ABC News: ‘We are looking at it very closely, it is an inconvenience to our customers, to determine if there are other options.’ The strong winds work in favour of travellers heading east, however. According to CNNMoney, U.S.-bound flights are saving money because of the added boost of the winds. Because of the unseasonably mild winter, airlines have been saving money that would have been otherwise spent ploughing, salting, and de-frosting. In addition, smaller airports can bring in ‘tens of thousands of dollars’ in landing fees and other profits. Other airlines have also been affected by the headwinds. American Airlines and US Airways both fly 757s to Europe but have had only a few diversions due to the strong winds. Delta, according to the Wall Street Journal, had none. A flight to Stuttgart, Germany from Newark, New Jersey is around 4,540 miles, though according to Boeing’s website, the 757 has a maximum range of around 4,450 nautical miles. Skyrocketing costs: Rising fuel prices have left the airline with few options - without headwinds, the flight can be done easily with a 757 . A spokeswoman said that several modifications to the model have allowed for better fuel efficiency. On a very short list of options, Continental has discussed the use of extra tanks on its 757 models, sources told the Journal. In 2005, the airline company swapped out many of its older features that were prime culprits in guzzling fuel. La Niña brings cooler than normal ocean temperatures across the Pacific and wetter than normal conditions in the northwest. Its outcomes most often manifest during the winter months. According to Nasa, trade winds are unusually strong during the weather pattern due to a contrast in pressure. Winglets were added to allow 200 additional miles of flying. Steel brakes were replaced with carbon ones, that cut the weight of the aircraft by 600 pounds. In addition, several coach-class seats were removed, bringing the total number to 169, allowing for slightly less luggage and more legroom, a spokesperson said. Retired Continental executive Gordon Bethune told the Journal that installing more fuel tanks is ‘not economical’ and ‘fairly complicated.’ USAirways still uses 777 and 767 jets, which travel longer distances without the need to refuel. Other larger models are used on different routes.","Continental often uses 757 jet for international flights .

Mona Lisa Tello, 61, allegedly handed in the forged letter to get more than a dozen days off work but suspicions were raised when officials spotted a series of misspellings . A teacher faked a jury duty letter to bunk off school but was caught out by her atrocious spelling, it is claimed. Mona Lisa Tello, 61, allegedly handed in the forged letter to get more than a dozen days off work but suspicions were raised when officials spotted a series of misspellings including 'trail' instead of 'trial', 'sited' instead of 'cited' and 'manger' instead of 'manager'. The New York science teacher, who was paid $76,000 a year, also allegedly put the wrong address on the letter and included fake bar codes and bogus fax and telephone numbers. Tello, who has been teaching for 13 years, has now agreed to retire from the High School of Graphic Communication Arts in Manhattan as of January 15. She also has to reimburse the city $3,374 for the salary she was paid while playing truant, according to court records, reports the New York Daily News. However Tello, who was recruited from Puerto Rico to teach children with Spanish as their first language, is now facing three charges of forgery. Prosecutors claim she used jury duty as an excuse for 15 absences between September 2010 and May 2011. The New York science teacher, who was paid $76,000 a year, also allegedly put the wrong address on the letter and included fake bar codes and bogus fax and telephone numbers . The probe first began in June 2011 when Principal Jerod Resnick became suspicious and together with Richard Condon, the school system’s Special Commissioner of Investigatio,n filed a complaint against her. After spotting the spelling mistakes, Mr Resnick had checked the letter supposedly from the Hudson County Superior Court in New Jersey with a court official, according to the Daily News. The courts then forwarded him a copy of the letter it had actually sent Tello informing her that 'her request to have jury service deferred had been approved and her new appearance date was Sept. 14, 2011'. Tello had claimed to be on jury duty while she bunked offl from the High School of Graphic Communication Arts (pictured) for five days in 2010 and on 10 other days last year, officials told the Daily News . Tello had claimed to be on jury duty . while she cut school for five days in 2010 and on 10 other days last . year, officials told the Daily News.

Tello was one of a dozen bilingual science teachers who were recruited from Puerto Rico in 1993. Her first job was teaching biology at the High School for Humanities in Manhattan. She was arraigned on Monday and released without bail until her next court date in March, according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 1:39 AM on 12th January 2012 . New controversy: Jeremy Clarkson compares Kent residents with immigrants from the Sangatte refugee camp . He has mocked dead cockle pickers, India's poverty-stricken and striking public sector workers in recent weeks. Now motormouth TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson has turned his acerbic humour to the people of Kent, suggesting the county is full of immigrants who escaped the  Sangatte refugee camp in France. The Top Gear presenter made the comments in an article he wrote about Kent, in which he ranted about the difficulties of driving through the county and labelled it The Twilight Zone. Clarkson . wrote in the latest issue of Top Gear: 'And what of the locals? Well, . they tend to be the sort of people who arrived in the back of a . refrigerated truck or clinging to the underside of a Eurostar train. 'And that reinforces my point rather well. 'Mboto has somehow evaded the gunmen and the army recruiters in his remote Nigerian village. 'He walked north, avoiding death and disease, and then somehow made it right across the Sahara desert to Algeria. 'Here, he managed to overwhelm the security men with their AK-47s and get on a boat to Italy, where he sneaked past the guards.' He added in the Top Gear article: 'He . made it all the way across Europe to Sangatte, from which he escaped one . night and swam to Kent. 'But that stumped him. Getting out of there was impossible, so he decided to make a new life in Maidstone.' Alex King, Kent County Council’s Deputy, said: 'This is yet another example of Jeremy Clarkson ranting, which readers and viewers have become resigned to. Garden of England... but Kent has come in for a Jeremy Clarkson lampooning . Sangatte escapees: Clarkson suggested locals in Kent were 'the sort of people who arrived in the back of a refrigerated truck' 'Many people I know now ignore his personal views - but so far continue to enjoy his programme. 'Kent has a wonderful mix of people . living here and is a county where Kent's people really make things . happen despite the challenges of being a frontier county.' Clarkson's article is just the latest in a series of controversial comments he has made in recent weeks. Earlier this week he likened synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecombe. In his column for The Sun, he said the sport amounted to . 'Chinese women in hats, upside down, in a bit of water', adding: 'You can see that sort of thing on Morecambe Beach. For free.' Twenty-three . Chinese migrant workers were drowned picking cockles in Morecambe Bay . in 2004 after they were trapped by the rising tide. Mocking: Jeremy Clarkson drove round Indian slums in this Jaguar fitted with a toilet, which he said was 'perfect for India' Clarkson is seen speaking with locals during the special road-trip around India on Top Gear . Last month the outspoken presenter sparked outrage when he mocked Indian culture in the Top Gear Christmas Special. Viewers were left furious after . Clarkson staged a series of Carry On-style digs at the country's . clothing, trains, toilets, food and history. At one point, the controversial . presenter ridiculed the unhygienic conditions and lack of sanitation . among the poor by driving around the slums in a Jaguar fitted with a . toilet. Showing off the car's convenience, he boasted: 'This is perfect for India because everyone who comes here gets the trots.'

"By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 1:23 PM on 11th January 2012 . A catastrophic fire swept through a South Korean fishing ship near Antarctica early Wednesday, killing three fishermen and leaving two others with severe burns. Rescue coordinators said the outcome could have been much worse had it not been for the assistance given by a nearby sister ship and another fishing vessel. Thirty-seven crew members were rescued, including two unconscious men who had been severely burned and were hoisted off the flaming ship by crane. Another five crew members suffered moderate burns. Catastrophe: The fire raged out of control on the South Korean fishing boat Jung Woo 2, pictured. The ship, the Jung Woo 2, got into trouble in the Ross Sea about 370 miles north of the U.S. McMurdo Station Antarctic base. It was still burning today and appeared to be sinking, Mike Roberts, the senior search and rescue officer with the Rescue Coordination Centre of New Zealand, said. A U.S. research vessel, the Nathaniel B. Palmer, was expected to reach the crew by tonight. Mr Roberts said the U.S. crew will treat the injured seamen, then put them ashore at McMurdo Base for more extensive help and possible evacuation to New Zealand. Mr Roberts said the blaze appears to have started in the living quarters of the 167-foot (51-meter) Jung Woo 2 before it quickly spread to the engine room and the ship's fish processing plant. It raged out of control, he said, with the crew's firefighting teams unable to halt its progress. Rescue: The ship caught fire near the McMurdo Station in the Antarctic . The three men who were killed never made it out of their quarters, Mr Roberts said. He said 25 men were able to get onto a life raft but the fire burned through the ship's other life raft, forcing 12 men to stay aboard until help arrived. The sister ship Jung Woo 3 and another Korean vessel, the Hong Jin 707, arrived within about three hours, Mr Roberts said. 'We're pretty fortunate that we were able to get 37 out of 40 to safety,' Roberts said. 'It was a really catastrophic event.' The two men who were unconscious at the time of the rescue have since regained consciousness, Roberts said, raising hopes they will survive their extensive burns. Roberts said the cause of the fire remains unknown. Australian records show the Jung Woo 2 is owned by the Sunwoo Corporation and is licensed to fish for Chilean sea bass, crab and other bottom-dwelling fish. The ship was built in 1985 in Japan and is registered in Busan, South Korea. The Jung Woo 2 is the second fishing vessel in less than a month to encounter serious trouble during the Antarctic summer fishing season. On December 16, the Russian vessel Sparta hit underwater ice that tore a 1ft hole in the hull and left the 32 crew stranded for 10 days, until rescue boats could get to it and make temporary repairs. The Sparta limped into a New Zealand port earlier this week.","Thirty-seven crew members rescued, including two unconscious men who had been severely burned .

"By . Chris Slack . Last updated at 7:43 AM on 12th January 2012 . Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has described Iran and Cuba as threats to the national security of the United States as the leaders of the two nations met in the island's capital of Havana today. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrived in the country for a brief meeting with Raul Castro during his Latin American tour which has already taken in Venezuela and Nicaragua. But in a statement issued earlier this week Ros-Lehtinen described the meeting as a 'tour of the tyrants' and said it was opportunity to 'spew anti-American rhetoric'. V for victory: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrives in Havana today to deliver a speech to students and for a meeting with Cuban President Raul Castro . Speech: Ahmadinejad told students at Havana's university that he wanted to know why Iran was being 'punished' no good reason . The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee added that the Iranian President's fifth visit to the region since 2007 gives an opportunity to unite Latin American leaders against the U.S.. And in a statement released today, the Republican representative from Florida said: 'Iran and Cuba are both state-sponsors of terrorism, and need to be . treated as immediate threats to our national security.' Warning: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has described Iran and Cuba as threats to the national security of the United States . She added: 'Just as the Iranian regime has rejected every overture by . the Administration, the Castro regime will never be coddled into . changing its ways.' Ahmadinejad was untroubled by the Congresswoman's comments as he landed at the island's Jose Marti International Airport today, flashing a victory sign several times at photographers as he was greeted by Cuba's Vice president Esteban Lazo. Later, the Iranian President gave a speech at Havana University where he demanded answers as to why Iran was being 'punished' no good reason. He told students: 'Have we assaulted someone? Have we . wanted more than we should have? Never, never. We have only asked to . speak about and establish justice.' He also railed against the United States and its allies and said heartless capitalism is the root cause of war during the speech. 'Thankfully we are already witnessing . that the capitalist system is in decay,' Ahmadinejad, who received an . honourary doctorate from the university, said. 'On various stages it has come to a dead end - politically, economically and culturally.' Greeting: Ahmadinejad shakes hands with Cuba's Vice president Esteban Lazo, who stands next to rector of University of Havana Gustavo Cobreiro Suarez . 'You see that when it lacks logic, they turn to weapons to kill and destroy.' he added. After the speech he refused to comment on a bomb attack this morning that killed a nuclear scientist in Tehran, although his government laid the blame on both Israel he U.S. and the UK. But the Iranian leader spoke warmly of his . Cuban hosts, describing the relationship of the two countries as . 'solidarity between two revolutionary peoples.' Ahmadinejad began his Latin America tour shortly after Washington imposed tougher sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program. Cuba was his third stop on his tour. He will visit Ecuador tomorrow.","Congresswoman describes both nations as threat to national security .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:58 PM on 11th January 2012 . Hero: Gareth Bellingham died after going to the rescue of an injured Afghan civilian . A hero soldier was shot dead as he went to the rescue of an Afghan civilian injured by a land mine. Private Gareth Bellingham died in a hail of bullets after being ambushed by insurgents in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province. The 22-year-old had heroically broken cover to help aid the stricken civilian injured by an explosive device on June 18 - but was fatally hit in the neck. An inquest on Tuesday into Pte Bellingham's death heard how the soldier - who was serving with the 3 Mercian . (Staffords) - was on a patrol providing protection for a meeting between . his commanding officer and local nationals. His role was to clear a path for the patrol using a metal detector to find improvised explosive devices (IEDs). But when a civilian was injured by an IED outside of the patrol zone, Pte Bellingham was sent to clear a path to the man. Captain Matthew Hickmott, who was in charge of the unit, said: 'He moved from his position, but he hadn’t gone very far when there was small arms fire. 'Our unit returned fire, and I radioed base and gave them as much information as possible. 'There was at least two of them firing at us. One with a machine gun and one with an automatic rifle. Devastated: Private Bellingham's parents, Les and Kimberley, look on as their son's body is repatriated in June . Tribute: Flags and a cross are pictured at a memorial to Private . Bellingham, described by his father as a 'proud, upstanding soldier' 'I shouted three times to Pte Bellingham but he did not respond. I went towards him and he was completely unresponsive.' As the fire fight continued around him, Cpt Hickmott administered first aid to Pte Bellingham, before being relieved by the unit’s medic. Send-off: Hundreds of friends and colleagues gathered to pay tribute to Private Bellingham at his funeral in Newcastle-under-Lyme . Once the fight was over, Pte Bellingham’s colleagues carried him to a point where he could be transported back to his base. Cpt Hickmott added: 'It’s a testament to Gareth’s character how hard everyone worked to save him, including the Afghan National Army, and even some local nationals. 'I hadn’t known Pte Bellingham very well before deployment, but we had built quite a close working relationship. 'He . had developed a reputation for being an excellent operator of the metal . detector. He had set the record for the number of sweeps he could do in . a short space of time.' Following the inquest yesterday, Pte Bellingham’s dad, Leslie, paid tribute to his son. The . 50-year-old, also from Clayton, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'Gareth’s death . has left a void in our lives, but I would like people to remember him as . a proud, upstanding soldier. 'We already knew how the Afghans had worked hard to save him, but hearing it in evidence brought it home.'

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 6:25 PM on 11th January 2012 . A teenage ice hockey player has been left paralysed by a dangerous hit from behind during a game just days after a 16-year-old was told he would never walk again following a similar incident. St Croix Luther High senior Jenna Privette, from Minnesota, was hospitalised after she was 'checked' from behind during a game on Friday night. She fell to the ice and was unable to move. Her injury comes only a week after Benilde St Margaret's player Jack Jablonski,16, was left paralysed for life in an almost identical incident just miles away. Passion: Despite receiving a similar ice hockey injury before, it did not deter Jenna Privette, 18, from returning to the game she loves . Danger: Jenna was slammed into the boards from behind when an opposing player checked her. She fell to the ice and didn't move . Injury: ice hockey star Jack Jablonski fractured two bones . in his lower neck as well as severing his spinal chord and is unlikely . to be able to walk ever again . Ironically, right before the game which left her in hospital, Jenna, 18, wrote on her Facebook page that she would be playing in honour of Jack and had even chaged her profile picture to the number 13 - which was the teen's player number - and the words 'Jack Jablonski, always in our hearts'. Before the game, she wrapped her stick in red tape as a tribute to the 16-year-old. Jenna is being treated at the Hennepin County Medical Centre in Minneapolis but doctors are confident she will make a full recovery as she has not broken her spinal chord, as in Jack's case - who was told he will likely never walk again as a result of the injury. Though she still has no feelings in her legs, she has pain and tingling in her arms and upper body, which is a 'good sign', according to her parents. Recovery: Though she only has feeling in parts of her upper body and none in her lower, doctors are confident she will make a full recovery as her spinal chord has not been broken . Parents: Dan and Penny Privette, of Burnsville, said they are remaining optimistic about her recovery as she has suffered a similar injury before and was given the OK to return to the ice . Dan and Penny Privette, of Burnsville, said they are remaining optimistic about her recovery as she has suffered a similar injury before and was given the OK to return to the ice, though it is still too early to say whether or not her injuries will be permanent. Mr Privette told the Star Tribune: 'She's irritable and in a lot of pain, which is, . in a way, kind of good.' Jenna's mother is calling for a changes in the game, as did Jack Jablonski's mother after her son's devastating injury. She said: 'The system needs to be reformed. Checking is getting so out of control.' A video of the game clearly shows the 18-year-old being checked into the boards from behind and falling immediately to the ice. The two incidents have caused players, parents and coaches to call for an overhaul of the rules of checking in ice hockey - which is one of the most common defensive techniques. Harsher penalties and and better warnings on the dangers of such aggressive hits are advised, as tensions among the Minnesota ice community have reached an all-time high following the reports of the two injuries. Love: Friends and family have been rallying around 18-year-old Jenna, right, as she recovers in hospital . Tribute: Hours before the game, Jenna changed her Facebook profile picture to honour Jack Jablonski, left, who was paralyzed after a December 30 game, and in a similar fashion, a Facebook page has been set up for Jenna, with her number and 'In Our Hearts' also included, right . Hospital: Doctors at first did not know how severe the injuries were but confirmed yesterday that he was paralyzed for life . Ken Pauly, head coach at Benilde, agrees that the sport faces questions and that checking from behind needs to be addressed. He told the Minnesota Star Tribune: 'I don't know how you couldn't have some hard questions after this. My take is, you can't legislate against tragedy. But what can you do to lessen the likelihood that a tragedy will occur? 'That said, the permissive culture of . checking from behind is an issue. Why would that not be treated like . fighting? Do we need rule changes? No. We need a change in mentality.' Jenna was playing for her team, the Minnehaha Saints, against the St Paul Blades on Friday night. After firing a shot on goal, she was allegedly checked into the boards from behind by an opposing defender. Fundraising: A joint Facebook support page has been set up for the two injured teens . According to St Croix athletic director Carl Lemke, the high school senior almost immediately lost feeling throughout most of her body. 'She's had an MRI, and it did not show breaks in the spinal cord, which makes it different than Jablonski's [injury],' Mr Lemke told the Star Tribune. 'It's an injury she's had in the past. Hopefully, it will improve.' Last week, Jack Jablonski's mother Leslie alarmingly warned: 'We just want to make sure this doesn't happen again. And if they keep playing the game the way it is, there's going to be more attacks in situations like this.' Mrs Jablonski went to visit Jenna in hospital to offer her support and bring a get well card.","Jenna Privette changed her profile picture to Jack Jablonski's number and name before the game .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:11 PM on 11th January 2012 . She struck up a friendship with Dennis and Daniel Mahon by displaying the Confederate flag, dressing in tank tops and shorts and sending racy photos, according to court records. Little did the Mahons know, Rebecca Williams - an attractive woman 20 years their junior - was working as a federal informant. Four years later, in June 2009, the white supremacist brothers from Illinois were charged in a 2004 bombing that injured a black city official in Scottsdale, Arizona. Today, the trial for the twin 61-year-olds - delayed several times because of the extensive amount of evidence in their case - was underway. On trial: Twins Daniel and Dennis Mahon were arrested in June 2009 after a five-year undercover operation . It started in February 26, 2004. A . bombing in which a package detonated in the hands of Don Logan, . Scottsdale's diversity director at the time. The package injured Logan's . hand and arm and hurt a secretary. The brothers have pleaded not guilty in the case. Scottsdale police immediately called . the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for assistance. But with limited access to the brothers, Williams was put on the case. As TPM Muckraker reports, federal . court records say little about Williams' background, a civilain with no . apparent professional training. In a hearing in September 2010 in federal court in Phoenix, she said she was hired 'just to get information.' She was placed with an undercover . female ATF agent in a trailer near the Mahons at a Catoosa, Oklahoma . trailer park - littered with cameras and microphones that would . eventually capture the Mahons' apparent confessions. Scene: Dennis and Daniel Mahon were arrested at their home in David Junction, Illinois (pictured) On the move: The Mahon brothers were living in Tempe in the months before the 2004 bombing, but moved to Catoosa, where the Feds sent their informant . Court records say the plan worked, and . that the Mahons came over as Williams was displaying a Confederate flag . in front of her trailer. Documents suggest Dennis Mahon opened . up to her, showed her how to make bombs and bragged about bombing a . Jewish community centre, an Internal Revenue Service building, an . immigration facility, and an abortion clinic. Those claims have not been . corroborated. He also talked to her about the . Scottsdale bombing, telling her that he didn't do it but convinced white . police officers to do it. While discussing the Scottsdale . bombing, court records indicate that Dennis Mahon said: 'I just wanted . to teach (Logan) a lesson the first time.' Dennis Mahon also is accused of making . a call to the diversity office in September 2003 and saying, 'the white . Aryan resistance is growing in Scottsdale. There's a few white people . who are standing up.' Mahon's defence attorney, Milagros . Cisneros, argued that Mahon 'often makes exaggerated self-aggrandizing . claims' that aren't true, that he was an alcoholic who constantly was . drinking Everclear, and that his statements to Williams were just meant . to impress her. Target: The Mahons pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the delivery of a package that detonated in the hands of former Scottsdale diversity director Don Logan . She and the other defence attorneys in . the case tried to get some of the charges thrown out based on what they . argued was 'outrageous government conduct' in the case that amounted to . entrapment and coercion. Williams also gave the Mahons at least . two racy photos - one that showed her in a leather jacket, fishnet . stockings and a thong that completely exposed her buttocks, along with a . note that said, 'Thought you'd love the butt shot.' The other showed . her in a revealing white bikini top with a grenade hanging between her . breasts as Williams posed in front of a pickup truck and a swastika. 'This individual represents hate, and . that hate is a danger to the community. That someone would come to Arizona and launch . an attack simply because my skin colour is different from theirs, simply . because of hate... is unconscionable.' - Don Logan . Prosecutors pointed out that Williams never kissed or had sex with either brother. Campbell agreed with the prosecution . in an October 2010 ruling, saying that although Dennis Mahon 'developed a . strong physical and emotional attraction to her,' their relationship . did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation that warranted . dismissing charges. In a letter filed as evidence in . federal court, Dennis Mahon wrote that he led the White Knights of the . Ku Klux Klan from 1987 to 1991 and that brother Daniel was never a . member of the group, only a 'small money supporter.' In a 2007 interview with a National . Geographic reporter, Dennis Mahon expressed his anti-government views, . saying that 'it's going to take violence' and praising Oklahoma City . bomber Tim McVeigh. 'They (the government) only understand . the rich and the powerful, but they also understand Tim McVeigh and . guys that know how to be violent in the right way to get the job done,' he said. He also said violence was a way to get . the attention of whites, warning that Mexicans were taking over the . Southwest and black people were taking over the South. Idolised: In a 2007 interview with a National Geographic reporter, Dennis Mahon praised Oklahoma City bomber Tim McVeigh (centre) Authorities said they found assault . weapons, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and white supremacist material . in the Mahons' home when they were arrested. Logan has denied requests to speak about the case but spoke in court during a hearing for Daniel Mahon shortly after his arrest. 'This individual represents hate, and . that hate is a danger to the community,' Logan said as he pointedly . looked Mahon in the eye. 'That someone would come to Arizona and launch . an attack simply because my skin colour is different from theirs, simply . because of hate... is unconscionable.' The Mahons are charged with conspiracy . to damage buildings and property by means of explosive, and Dennis . Mahon also is charged with malicious damage of a building by means of . explosive and distribution of information related to explosives. Judge David Campbell ordered the case . to proceed today over the objection of defence attorneys who said they . needed another week to prepare. The Mahons, dressed in suits, sat . quietly as U.S. Marshals stood close by. Jury selection is expected to take . through Wednesday. Opening statements are scheduled for Thursday . morning, and the trial is expected to last about two months.","Twins Dennis and Daniel Mahon arrested in 2009 after five-year undercover operation .

Sgt Brent McBride, 25, was initially charged with murder over the death of Sgt Gallagher from Falmouth, Massachussetts. However following a hearing in Texas last month no further legal proceedings were set for McBride, an army source told msnbc.com, but the military would carry out its own investigation. Sgt Gallagher's widow Katie, 23, and his mother Cheryl Ruggiero spoke for the first time this week to the Boston Globe about the investigation in December - and had many unanswered questions. In the weeks following his death, his wife . and mother came to believe he had died in action. Reports from the investigation in Texas . last month said that Sgt Gallagher pointed his gun at Sgt McBride, saying: 'What would you do now?' It is then believed that McBride drew his own gun and pointed it at Gallagher’s head before firing the fatal shot. The lawyer for McBride said at the time . it was a 'tragic accident', and he did not know the 9mm pistol came to be loaded, . according to the Cape Cod Times. Mrs Ruggerio, 53, who is suspicious of McBride's account, told the Boston Globe: 'He did take someone’s life. You can say . it was a horrible accident, but he knew, as a soldier, with his . training, it’s not something you do. You don’t pick up a gun and put it . to someone’s head.’ Demanding answers: Sgt Gallagher's widow, Katie, 23, and mother Cheryl Ruggiero, from Falmouth, Massachussets still have questions about their loved one's death . McBride was initially charged with . murder but an Army spokesman at Fort Hood, Texas, told msnbc.com that no . further legal proceedings are set 'pending a review' by the Army. It is . not clear whether the soldier will be court-martialled. Sources said that several soldiers and at least one higher-ranking staff sergeant warned them against playing the game. The death of 22-year-old Sgt Gallagher remains under investigation. Meanwhile, McBride remains on active duty at Fort Hood, according to the Cape Cod Times.

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 11:57 PM on 9th January 2012 . The battle for Britain’s living rooms intensified yesterday with the UK launch of film-rental service Netflix. The U.S. firm offers subscribers a library of thousands of movies and TV programmes that can be streamed over the internet to televisions, computers or smartphones for just £5.99 a month. In comparison, Sky charges £16 a month for its bundle of movie channels, while Virgin Media charges £21.50. The fees come on top of basic subscription packages for set-top boxes and TV channels. How you can use Netflix to watch movies . Netflix could pose a threat to both companies, as well as other internet services such as Lovefilm, which is owned by Amazon. Films from Netflix (and Lovefilm) are available to watch on computers, tablets, smartphones and newer internet-enabled televisions, and can also be streamed on normal TVs through an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 games console. Netflix customers can watch in their living rooms using a Nintendo Wii or Apple’s iTV set-top box, too. The launch could put further pressure on Britain’s broadband infrastructure, which may struggle to cope if Netflix becomes a hit. This is because customers stream its films to their homes each time a movie is watched, instead of downloading and storing it for later. Subscription: £5.99 per month . Works on: iPhone, iPad, Android phones and tablets Xbox 360, Wii, PCs, Macs, Samsung Smart TV and LG home cinema systems . Requires broadband internet . Unlimited access to films and TV shows . There is already evidence that the popularity of the BBC’s online . streaming service, iPlayer, means that other web users experience slower . internet speeds at peak times. Netflix’s success in the U.S. – where it accounts for about a third of . internet use – has led to some internet service providers capping their . customer’s usage, or introducing higher charges for heavy users. The future of on-demand streaming services in the UK will largely depend . on which films and TV programmes they can secure the rights to. Netflix, which already has 20million subscribers worldwide, should have . enough financial muscle to build its business in Britain. It has signed . digital licensing deals with the BBC and Hollywood studios such as MGM, . Miramax and Lionsgate, and is offering potential customers a free . one-month trial. While initially its library looks limited, once . established, it hopes to offer the latest films for streaming as soon as . they become available on DVD. Lovefilm, which already has two million UK customers, according to . Amazon, reacted to Netflix’s launch by announcing a £4.99-a-month . package for unlimited streaming. Sky has responded to the emergence of both companies by making its TV . and film services available on a subscription basis over the internet as . well.","Unlimited access via PC or TV for £5.99 a month .

New findings: Researchers have discovered that babies understand what their mums say - even though they don't know the language she is speaking . Babies understand what their mothers  say, even when they speak in a language their children have never heard before,    scientists claim. They found one-year-olds reacted in exactly same way to their mother’s voice regardless of whether she was speaking in English or Greek. It proves what mothers have long known – that babies pick up on tone of voice rather than the words. The researchers, from Cardiff University’s School of Psychology, observed babies as they watched their mothers perform actions with toys using the English words ‘whoops’ and ‘there’. The scientists studied reactions from one-year-old babies to their mum’s voice even when she was speaking either languages.. And the same process was repeated in Greek with the same tone in the voice. The academics found that babies reproduced the same reaction regardless of whether they knew the language - proving it was all Greek to them. Study leader Dr Merideth Gattis, of Cardiff University’s School of Psychology, said: 'What this work showed was that children could have access to understanding using simply the tone of voice. 'We did “whoops” and “there” in two languages and got exactly the same results - whether in English or Greek, which none of the children understood.' The research published in the journal Cognitive Development was conducted with 84 babies, aged between 14 and 18 months, in Cardiff over the course of a year with none of the babies having any previous exposure to Greek. Dr Gattis said that children respond to 'tone' clues in their parents’ speech from an early age. Interesting: Researchers said that children respond to 'tone' clues in their parents' speech from an early age . She said: 'Tone of voice is a really useful signal to what someone is thinking. 'We never have access through to other people’s minds, except the signals in language that we give out.' She said that the study results meant that it was less important what parents said, but 'how they said it'. She said that even swearing, or anger could theoretically be 'covered up' by disguising tone - but that it was better to use another word in its place. Dr Gattis said: 'It could be the child asks us if you like their drawing. 'You might say yes, but if you don’t sound enthusiastic, it could be that meaning doesn’t get across. 'At the stage of life before children get access to words and language, parents’ tone is exaggerated when speaking to babies. 'There is a group of parents that may not be as confident as other parents and feel very self-conscious. 'If a health visitor says: “Talk to the baby” sometimes these parents say that they don’t know what to say. 'But this study shows that they shouldn’t worry so much about what to say, but rather pay attention to the tone.'",Babies reacted in the same way to their mother  whether she was speaking in English or Greek .

"By . Jenny Hope . Last updated at 1:49 AM on 12th January 2012 . A new drug which can give men with advanced prostate cancer an extra three months of life has been rejected for use on the NHS. Cabazitaxel increases survival for men who had already tried a range of other therapies. Each year around 35,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer, with around 10,000 having locally advanced disease who might be eligible for the drug. But the NHS rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, says it is not value for money despite admitting it works. An electron micrograph of prostatic cancer cells. A new drug prolonging life for prostate cancer sufferers has been rejected by the NHS rationing body . In draft guidance issued today Nice says the drug is not cost-effective, even though it was fast-tracked in the US as a ‘last chance’ treatment for prostate cancer sufferers. The drug made by Sanofi costs around £22,000 for a one-off course of treatment. The Prostate Cancer Charity said men in England would have to apply to the Cancer Drugs Fund in a bid to get it, but the option was not open to men in Wales which does not have a similar fund. Owen Sharp, chief executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity, said ‘This decision is a huge blow to men living with the very advanced stages of prostate cancer who currently have very limited treatment options open to them. ‘Cabazitaxel is one of only two licensed drugs available in the UK that offers the hope of precious extra time to men living with advanced prostate cancer. ‘Nice’s decision not to recommend this drug means that men in England and Wales with advanced prostate cancer will find it much harder to access it through the NHS. ‘We are very concerned that this will lead to a postcode lottery and mean some men will not be able to get cabazitaxel in time for it to benefit them. “It is essential that men who have been prescribed this drug because their doctors think it will benefit them can still access it on the NHS. ‘We hope that a review of NICE’s recommendation will take place as soon as the drug manufacturers are able to provide more information about the difference this drug can make to the quality of life of men with advanced prostate cancer.’ Results from a clinical trial of 755 men from 26 countries found the drug had benefits in patients whose cancer continued to progress despite the use of the current final option, the chemotherapy drug Taxotere. Men whose cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland are usually treated with drugs that reduce the body’s production of testosterone, a hormone that can feed cancer growth. When such therapy fails, Taxotere is used but this often fails as well. The trial showed the overall survival of men taking cabazitaxel was 15.1 months compared with 12.7 months for men taking the drug mitoxantrone, used to promote quality of life. Other information considered by Nice concluded men gained an average of three months’ extra life. Owen Sharp, from the Prostate Cancer Charity, said the news is a 'huge blow' for those in the advanced stage of the disease . The US drugs watchdog, the Food and Drugs Administration, considered cabazitaxel, also known as Jevtana, under its priority review programme for drugs that may offer a major advance in treatment and approved it in 2010. Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of Nice said ‘Although cabazitaxel has been shown to be effective in extending life, it is also associated with a number of side effects. ‘Once these factors had been taken into account, the independent Committee appraising this drug concluded that it would not provide enough health benefit to justify its cost, which means it would not be a cost effective use of limited NHS resources. ‘The draft guidance on cabazitaxel is now with consultees, who have the opportunity to appeal against it. Until NICE issues final guidance, NHS bodies should make decisions locally on the funding of specific treatments. ‘This draft guidance does not mean that people currently taking cabazitaxel will stop receiving it. They have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.’ Dr Jasmin Hussein, oncology medical manager of Sanofi, said ‘We are disappointed that Nice has not recommended the use of Jevtana on the basis of . cost. It offers an important new treatment option with significant clinical benefit. ‘There is significant clinical need within the NHS for Jevtana – with around 100 patients having been prescribed the drug through the Cancer Drugs Fund.’","Cabazitaxel increases survival for men in advanced stage of disease .

It may come across as an extreme case of nuptial nostalgia: A now-divorced man saying a photography studio should pay to recreate his wedding to make up for what he considers flawed pictures and video. Never mind that the New Yorker's ex-wife has moved to her native Latvia and has so far proved uncontactable. Brushing that aside as well as being branded a 'groomzilla' Todd Remis has spoken out for the first time about his now notorious lawsuit. Disgruntled: Todd Remis with his Latvian bride Milena Grzibovska in one of the images taken by the photographer during the wedding. He claims the pictures and video were botched . His comments released today are his first public response to a flurry of mocking commentary on the case . He said it was about holding a business to a pledge, not holding onto a broken marriage. It was his first public response to a flurry of acidic commentary on the case in recent months. 'It was their failure to deliver . after a promise and a handshake' agreement to retouch the photos, Remis . said in a statement. 'How could a business treat a customer this way?' While lawsuits over wedding . photographs aren't unusual, what set Remis' case apart is his mention of . wanting to reconstitute the ceremony and celebration of a bygone union. He said during sworn questioning in 2011 that the two began divorce . proceedings in 2008. The split was final in 2010, and he said he believed his ex-wife had moved back to her native Latvia. Nonetheless, 'I need to have the . wedding recreated exactly as it was so that the remaining 15 per cent of . the wedding that was not shot can be shot' and the album and video . completed 'so we have memories of the wedding,' he said during his . deposition. 'So we would need to recreate everything to complete that.' And he has demanded in court papers . that the firm repay him the $4,100 cost of the wedding photos and that . he is awarded $48,000 to allow him to re-enact the day and fly in guests . to New York. Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Doris Ling-Cohan invoked . lyrics from Barbara Streisand hit 'The Way We Were' in an earlier ruling. 'This is a case in which it appears . that the ""misty watercolor memories"" and the ""scattered pictures of the . smiles ... left behind"" at the wedding were more important than the real . thing,' she wrote . The photographic studio has pointed . out however that the bride is now in Latvia and un-contactable. In a . blunt statement, studio co-founder Harold Gillet wrote a letter to the . court stating: 'The divorce renders the further demands for photos, . etc., ridiculous.' After Remis's remarks about . recreating the wedding appeared in a story in The New York Times in . November, Remis' quest became a punchline in quarters ranging from the . legal blogosphere to the city's tabloids. The Daily News gave him a 'New . York Knucklehead Award'; CNN's Anderson Cooper included Remis on his . 'RidicuList'. He began sueing H&H Photographers . in 2009, saying the venerable suburban New York studio had done a . shoddy job of shooting his and Milena Grzibovska's December 2003 wedding . at a century-old hotel overlooking the Hudson River. Remis, 44, who has worked as a stock . analyst, says the photographer ignored the couple's request not to shoot . in front of a mirror that ended up reflecting photographers' lights, . and the photographer and videographer left 45 minutes before the end of . the reception, missing the last dance and the bouquet toss. Broken marriage: The couple married in front of 40 guests at Castle on the Hudson in Tarrytown, Westchester, but separated in 2008 . Stunning: The Castle on the Hudson where Remis married. He wants his 2003 wedding re-staged at the upmarket venue and that the photographers from the day to foot the bill. Grzibovska, who is in her early 30s, . had come to New York in June 2002 from the University of Iceland to . study how to teach English to foreign-language speakers, according to a . piece that September in a Columbia University newspaper. The couple had paid a $3,500 advance . toward a $4,100 total price for the photos, part of a wedding he said . cost $48,000 in all, including guests' travel. Still, Remis and his bride 'were newly married and in love' and not looking for a fight with photographers, his statement says. H&H co-owner Daniel Fried says he . stands by the quality of the two hours of video and the hundreds of . color and black-and-white photos, which were shot on film. Photo company founder Curt Fried, who sold his half of the business to his son Dan, right, says Mr Remis doesn't even know where his wife lives now . 'I think the photography is lovely,' said Fried. But he said he offered in 2004 to adjust the photos and . upgrade the wedding album, telling Remis the two needed first to pick . out which pictures they wanted. 'Obviously, I couldn't turn back the clock,' Fried said. He says Remis never got back to . H&H until he wrote in 2009 to demand a refund and interest - about . $5,750 in all - and the completed photos and video. No contact information could be found for Grzibovska. The idea of a wedding-photos dispute . that outlasted the marriage has been met with raised eyebrows by . Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Doris Ling-Cohan, who invoked . lyrics from the Barbara Streisand hit 'The Way We Were' in a ruling last . year that threw out some legal claims but let others go forward. 'This is a case in which it appears . that the ""misty watercolor memories"" and the ""scattered pictures of the . smiles ... left behind"" at the wedding were more important than the real . thing,' she wrote. And H&H co-founder Harold Gillet . put it more bluntly in an August 2010 letter to the court: 'The divorce . renders the further demands for photos, etc., ridiculous.'

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 7:48 PM on 10th January 2012 . Four thugs who were caught laughing as their dogs tore wild animals to pieces have been jailed for their part in ‘barbaric’ and ‘abhorrent’ badger baiting. Scarborough Magistrates’ Court heard how a group of six men and a teenage boy dug out and killed two badgers from a sett on farmland at Howsham, near York, in January last year. Sobia Ahmed, prosecuting, said dogs played tug-of-war with one of the badgers before it was shot in the head and slung into undergrowth, while a pregnant badger was torn to pieces and bled to death. Warning: Graphic content . A wildlife photographer Robert Fuller managed to take this picture showing one of the men snatching at a badger in the dog's mouth . Mr Fuller presented his photos of the gang badger baiting in the hope that they would help convict the men . Alan Alexander, 32, Richard Simpson, 37, and Paul Tindall, 31, all from York, and William Anderson, 26, from Pickering, North Yorkshire, were jailed for 16 weeks at Scarborough Magistrates’ Court after being found guilty of wilfully killing a badger, hunting a mammal with dogs, digging for badgers and interfering with a badger sett. Alexander and Simpson were also convicted of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. Another two men, Christopher Holmes, 28, and Malcolm Warner, 28, both from York, were handed 12-week custodial sentences suspended for 12 months after they pleaded guilty to wilfully killing a badger, digging for badgers and interfering with a badger sett. District Judge Kristina Harrison said she was sending out a clear signal to anybody involved in such activities that they would be sent to prison. 'Barbaric': Richard Simpson, left, and Alan Alexander, right, arrive at Scarborough Magistrates’ Court to hear their sentence . A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be . named for legal reasons, was given a youth rehabilitation order after he . was also found guilty of wilfully killing a badger, hunting a mammal . with dogs, digging for badgers and interfering with a badger sett. Sentencing the men and the teenager, . Ms Harrison said: ‘Badger baiting is regarded as a barbaric sport and . the public feeling is one of revulsion.’ She . continued: ‘The people of Yorkshire will not tolerate badger baiting in . their midst. It’s barbaric, it’s abhorrent and anyone convicted of this . kind of offence will receive a custodial sentence. ‘This is a clear signal to anybody who seeks to commit this kind of behaviour.’ 'Abhorrent': Paul Tindall, pictured left, and William Anderson, right, arriving for sentencing . Ms Ahmed told the court that two . witnesses, including wildlife photographer Robert Fuller, heard the sound of dogs barking excitedly and a badger . squealing in distress and went to investigate. When they reached the scene, they saw two large dogs attacking a badger. Ms Ahmed said: ‘They had hold of it in their mouths and were shaking it violently. They said the dogs were playing tug of war with the badger.’ Mr Fuller today recalled how the men ‘laughingly’ encouraged the beasts before they spotted Mr Fuller and fled the rural scene by the River Derwent, near Howsham in North Yorkshire. After some time, the badger was shot dead by Anderson and the men, who had become aware of the witnesses and tried to cover their tracks by throwing the dead badger into the undergrowth. They then buried a second dead badger . - a pregnant animal which had been torn to pieces by the dogs - back . into the hole from which it had been dug. Ms Ahmed said witnesses called the police and the men and teenager were arrested a short time later. Police . and RSPCA inspectors who visited the scene found animal intestines and . badger foetuses scattered around and areas of congealed blood, believed . to be from where the badger had been shot. When they recovered the two badgers, one was found to have been shot at close range and had a fractured skull and jaw. The group of men stuffed this dead badger back into its sett in attempt by the men to conceal the crime . The other had part of its abdomen missing and injuries consistent with being attacked by a dog. Mr Fuller, 38, later gave his pictures to the police and RSPCA and they were used to convict the gang. When they investigated, the authorities established the men had killed three adult badgers and three unborn cubs. Ms Ahmed said the pregnant badger suffered 'a sustained attack by a number of dogs that had caused the badger to be torn to pieces and eventually it bled to death' while the other had a 'gunshot wound to the head immediately after a severe and sustained attack by a number of dogs'. Wildlife photographer Robert Fuller caught the group in the act and was able to take pictures that helped secure a conviction . Ms Ahmed described the operation as a 'sophisticated enterprise' in which the men used equipment to track down the badgers. Mr Fuller, who lives in Thixendale, North Yorksshire, was praised by the trial judge as ‘brave’ and ‘courageous’. Alexander, Anderson, Simpson and Tindall were told they would serve eight weeks of their sentences before being released on licence. They were each ordered to pay £750 costs and £100 compensation. Each of the four defendants was handcuffed and led out of the crowded courtroom by security guards while members of their families sobbed. Holmes and Warner were told to pay £250 costs and £100 compensation and the 17-year-old was told he would be placed under supervision for 12 months and would have to undertake a number of programmes, including one run by the RSPCA, as part of his youth rehabilitation order. Mr Fuller today recalled of how he encountered the gang while he was out looking for otters with friend Ged Farmer last January. He said: ""In all there were 13 dogs, eight men with five guns and, as was later established, three dead badgers and three unborn cubs. 'I asked Ged to go and call the police while I took photographs of what was going on. 'I was scared about being seen but I was so sickened by it that I wanted to get pictures of the men being caught in the act. 'One badger gave up and the men just shot it dead. 'This gang were so brazen about what they were doing, it was almost as though they didn’t care.'I knew that my pictures might be used as evidence in the future and I’m glad they help catch these men.' He added: 'What I saw that day shocked me. Badgers are tough animals. They will fight when under attack, but generally they are not aggressive. 'What turns my stomach about badger baiting is that they were doing it for the sheer thrill. The men I watched were laughing.' Speaking after the sentencing, RSPCA Inspector Geoff Edmond said: ‘This is the highest level of animal cruelty. It’s people who have organised to go into the North Yorkshire countryside, dig out and cruelly bait badgers. He added: 'The significance of what Robert Fuller did cannot be underestimated.

A road rage dentist who knocked out a pensioner's teeth . and broke his cheekbone with a single blow has been declared fit to practise following a year-long ban. Shaun Edwards, 46, was spared jail after he admitted . the 'appalling and terrifying' attack on 67-year-old Albert Finney. The . former Army major leapt out of his black BMW and issued his victim with the . chilling warning: 'If you knew who I am, you wouldn't tangle with me.' Edwards, . who at the time was running the Sneyd Dental Practice in Newcastle-under-Lyme, . Staffordshire, was handed a four-month prison sentence, suspended for two . years, when he appeared in court. He was suspended for 12 months in . January 2011 after a General Dental Council committee ruled his fitness to . practise was impaired by reason of his conviction. Lydia Barnfather, for the GDC, had told how Edwards clashed . with Mr Finney during the morning rush hour on November 30, 2009, in Festival . Park, Cobridge, Stoke. Mr Finney, a cleaning contractor, was at . the wheel of his red van when Edwards suddenly pulled out causing him to slam . on the brakes. Further down the road, Edwards' BMW ended up getting . blocked by Mr Finney, who got out of his van 'to explain', said the solicitor. Ms Barnfather said: 'Mr Edwards got out of . his vehicle and walked back to Mr Finney. 'In an appalling and terrifying moment of . loss of self-control, Mr Edwards attacked him. 'His recollection was there was a headbutt . and a punch. 'He describes a punch with his right fist . to the bottom of his left side jaw. 'He felt his nose bleeding and put a hanky . to his nose.' Edwards, a dentist and former Army major, choked back tears as he described the road rage incident in Newcastle-under-Lyme (above) as a 'terrible error' The victim exclaimed: 'Are you crazy?' and the dentist replied: . 'If you knew who I am, what I've done and what I've been through, you wouldn't . tangle with me.' Edwards was interviewed by police three days later, when he . claimed he was defending himself against Mr Finney and only went for him with a . 'girlish swing'. 'At this stage I think he is going to . assault me, or trying and assault me again,' he said. 'I put my head down and . swung at him in a non-accurate manner.' Edwards admitted inflicting grievous . bodily harm at Stoke-On-Trent Crown Court on May 26, 2010. In addition to . the suspended sentence, he was ordered to pay Mr Finney £7,474 . compensation, plus £1,200 court costs. He was also ordered to complete . 220 hours of unpaid work. The married father-of-two, who grew up in . Cannock, Staffordshire, and qualified in Liverpool, choked back tears as he described . the affair as a 'terrible error'. At the initial hearing, he said: 'I . totally overreacted. 'The shame I've brought on myself, the . practice, the profession, the remorse is almost overwhelming at times. 'I'd like to apologise to Mr Finney if he . was here. 'If I can offer reassurance that it won't . happen again, I'd like to do so now. 'It is a very, very painful experience. I . would not like to be here again.'","Ex-Army major Shaun Edwards clashed with 67-year-old during morning rush hour .

Vile: Khloe Kardashian took to Twitter to deny the shocking allegations made by Robert Kardashian's ex-wives, who claim he told them that Khlow was not his daughter . Khloe Kardashian isn't one to keep quiet and today she branded her father's ex-wives 'disgusting'. She took to Twitter to deny the shocking allegations made by Robert Kardashian's ex-wives, who claim he told them that Khloe was not his daughter. The 27-year-old reality TV star posted: 'The audacity you have to . mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a . lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).' The posts were clearly directed at Jan Ashley and Ellen Pierson who have both spoken out to say that Robert told them Khloe was not his. Ms Ashley, who married the businessman . after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told . me that after we got married.' And . Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before . his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell . the truth' about the Kardashian family. Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter . The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'. A spokesperson for Khloe told MailOnline today: 'The story is NOT true. It’s ridiculous.' But while Khloe has slammed the allegation she has herself questioned if she was adopted on the family's reality TV show. Viewers of Keeping Up With The Kardashians did see her question who her parents were in an episode in 2009. The reality star wanted to prove she was not adopted and tested the maternity of her mother Kris Jenner. Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney . While she proved she was Kris's daughter she did not compare her DNA with her siblings to prove conclusively that Robert is her biological father. In an explosive interview with Star . magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it . was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a . Kardashian, don't you?"" 'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.' Voicing concerns: In a 2009 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians Khloe questions if she is adopted . Proof: Khloe made Kris take a DNA test to prove she was her child but she did not confirm paternity . She claims Khloe, who is married to . Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different . father to her sisters and younger brother Rob. 'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, . light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three . children.' She said Robert, . who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not . sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered . a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that . Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter. Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child' Daddy's little girl: Khloe shared this adorable picture of her with her father, who died in 2003, on her blog in 2010 . High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994 . Kris, . 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during . their marriage. Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010. The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October. Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie. Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon. Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born. On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney. She . wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to . post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and . to Bruce. 'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up . because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than . anything, but adored each other as well. 'My dad and Bruce were always really close — Kendall and Kylie even called my dad Uncle Robert which I loved.' She . continued: 'Father’s Day is always a bittersweet holiday for me because .

A sick thug who killed a Big Issue seller for kicks has been released from his custodial sentence after just two years and has taken to Facebook to tell of his ‘boredom’. Warren Crago was 16 when he and two teenage friends beat homeless man Ralph Millward, 41, to death after finding him asleep on a pavement in Westbourne, Bournemouth. Although a judge described the brutal attack as the 'worst case of mob violence imaginable', Crago and accomplice Craig Real were jailed for four years. Sickening attack: Warren Crago (left) was 16 when he and two friends . beat homeless man Ralph Millward (right) to death because he refused to . given them cigarettes . But after serving half of their sentence they are now back on the streets. Crago, now 18, has gone on Facebook to write about being bored after getting out of ‘pen’. He is even using his police mugshot photo as his profile picture. He wrote: 'Jus got out pen and thikin bout goin bk i am bored nuthin to do out in the big world for me.' Real used the social networking site to have a vile rant at the police for trying to ‘send me down for murder’ as well as threatening to punch ‘black boys’. Mr Millward’s grieving father Ken, 78, said he was sickened by the teenagers’ conduct. Bored: Crago's pathetic whinge on Facebook has incensed the victim's father . He said: 'I would have hanged them. I have always believed in life for a life. 'I profess to be a Christian, I go to church, but for me I can never forgive them.' A female friend of Mr Millward, who didn’t want to be named, added: 'These thugs have evidently not learned their lesson from being in prison and are taking no responsibility.' Accomplice: Jimmy Ayres was convicted of the attack alongside Crago. Real, Crago and 15-year-old Jimmy Ayres, all from the Rossmore estate in Poole, Dorset, had spent the night of May 6, 2009 drinking cider and vodka. At 2am, they went out to get some cigarettes and found Mr Millward in his sleeping bag at his regular pitch in Westbourne, Bournemouth. They woke him up, but he refused to hand over his cigarettes, prompting the savage attack. The victim suffered 10 broken ribs, a . ruptured spleen and bleeding on the brain. His injuries were said to . have been consistent with being involved in a car crash. The yobs were caught on CCTV re-enacting the attack, making punching and stamping motions as they walked up the road. Mr Millward’s body was discovered a few hours later by an outreach worker who went to check up on him. The teenage trio were found guilty of manslaughter at Winchester Crown Court last year. Judge Guy Boney QC said: 'You carried out this attack for no better reason than you were bored and looking for excitement.' Real, a dad of one, was jailed for four years and nine months, Crago for four years and Ayres for 90 weeks. After being released, Real wrote on Facebook about how he had been stopped by the police, prompting an online rant. He wrote: 'I hate the old bill never b polite to them after trying to send me down for murder.' He also wrote vile racist remarks about black people. He added: 'I’m not ona bout anyone else its just the black boys I’ve had a life time off them inside and they won’t be kissing there teeth when I’m out aswell cause ill knock there teeth out next time.'","Attack by Warren Crago and two mates 'worst case of mob violence imaginable'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:53 PM on 11th January 2012 . Vertigo actress Kim Novak has launched a bizarre attack on hit film The Artist claiming its use of the distinctive and haunting music from Hitchcock's movie amounted to 'rape'. Novak, 78, who shot to fame after appearing in the 1958 classic, took a full page ad in entertainment magazine Variety last week to declare: 'I want to report a rape.' She added: 'I FEEL AS IF MY BODY... OR, AT LEAST MY BODY OF WORK - HAS BEEN VIOLATED BY THE MOVIE THE ARTIST.' Attack ad: Actress Kim Novak, right, took out a full page advertisement in Variety, seen at left, to protest the use of composer Bernard Herrmann's music from Vertigo in the film The Artist . Music from Vertigo is used in the French black-and-white homage to the silent-film era. She went on: 'It is morally wrong for . the artistry of our industry to use and abuse famous pieces of work to . gain attention and applause for other than what they were intended.' However, her choice of language was . cricitised by Lynn Blanco, CEO of the Rape Crisis Center in San Antonio, . Texas, who argued that the comparison to rape was extreme. Ms Blanco, who is a victim of rape . herself, told FoxNews.com: 'When rape is used in a way that . overdramatizes a situation that did not include an actual rape it . diminishes the suffering of the thousands of men, women and children who . have suffered from the crime.' Oscar contender: The Artist, which stars Jean Dujardin, left, and Berenice Bejo, right, is a favourite for the upcoming Academy Awards . Novak's language was seen as horribly extreme and over-the-top by advocates against sexual assault. 'I WANT TO REPORT A RAPE. I FEEL AS IF MY BODY... OR, AT LEAST MY BODY OF WORK - HAS BEEN VIOLATED BY THE MOVIE THE ARTIST.' - Kim Novak . Lynn Blanco, CEO of the Rape Crisis Center in San Antonio, Texas, . and a rape victim herself, told FoxNews.com: 'When rape is used . in a way that overdramatizes a situation that did not include an actual . rape it diminishes the suffering of the thousands of men, women and . children who have suffered from the crime.' The ad, which appeared in Variety magazine this week, came at the same time as a statement by the actress. In it, the 78-year-old said she felt violated because music from the Alfred Hitchcock classic is used in the French black-and-white homage to the silent-film era. Music man: Bernard Herrmann wrote the score for Vertigo, as well as the Orson Welles' classic Citizen Kane . Novak said The Artist filmmakers had no reason 'to depend on Bernard Herrmann's score from 'Vertigo' to provide more drama' for the movie. 'This film took the love theme music from Vertigo and used the emotions it engenders as its own. Alfred Hitchcock and Jimmy Stewart can't speak for themselves, but I can.' Hitchcock, who also directed horror . classics like Psycho and The Birds, died in 1980. Stewart, most famous . for his role in Christmas classic It's a Wonderful Life, passed away in . 1997. Novak added: 'It was our work that unconsciously or consciously evoked the memories and feelings to the audience that were used for the climax of The Artist.' Novak, who played the dual role of both a suicidal trophy wife of a rich San Franciscan and a morose working girl opposite Stewart in the Hitchcock thriller, said that even though Herrmann was given 'a small credit at the end,' she believed 'this kind of filmmaking trick to be cheating.' 'The Artist,' which was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius and stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo as silent film actors, leads Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony with six nominations and is expected to be a front-runner at this year's Academy Awards. The wordless film combines a mostly original jazzy score, sound effects and old-fashioned title cards which display dialogue. Opposing statement: In a response to Novak's campaign, The Artist's writer/director/editor Michel Hazanavicius said he respects Kim Novak greatly, and 'is sorry to hear she disagrees' Master of horror: Kim Novak says she is speaking on behalf of Vertigo director Alfred Hitchcock, who died in 1980 . In a statement, Hazanavicius said: 'The Artist was made as a love letter to cinema, and grew out of my [and all of my cast and crew's] admiration and respect for movies throughout history.' 'It was inspired by the work of Hitchcock, [Fritz] Lang, [John] Ford, [Ernst] Lubitsch, [F.W.] Murnau and [Billy] Wilder.' He added: 'I love Bernard Herrmann and his music has been used in many different films and I'm very pleased to have it in mine. I respect Kim Novak greatly, and I'm sorry to hear she disagrees.' Novak, who last appeared in the film Liebstraum in 1991, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. Seeing double: Kim Novak shot to fame for her dual role as Madeleine Elster and Judy Barton in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 classic Vertigo .","Star of Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo says The Artist ripped off Bernard Herrmann's music from her film .

With two failed marriages and a legion of lovers behind her, you could forgive Madonna for being something of a cynic in matters of the heart. But the singer yesterday admitted that she was still a romantic and hoped one day to be ‘swept away by a knight in shining armour’. She also revealed that despite the  breakdown of her marriages to actor Sean Penn and director Guy Ritchie she would wed again – if asked. Caped crusader: Madonna poses for pictures and fans on the red carped at the W.E premiere at The Odeon on Kensington High Street yesterday . Not a hair out of place: A stylist adjusts the singer's curls last night . The 53-year-old was speaking to chat show host Graham Norton before the  premiere of her new film, WE. Madonna, who directed the movie about the love affair between Wallis Simpson  and King Edward VIII, chose a classic  black velvet strapless gown and lace cape for last night’s red carpet appearance  at the Odeon cinema in Kensington,  West London. And although the Material Girl would  easily pass for a woman 15 years younger, she gave a few clues to her real age by  covering her tell-tale wrinkly hands with a pair of bright red leather gloves. The mother of four, who arrived with her dancer boyfriend Brahim Zaibat, who at 24 is 29 years her junior, had earlier told Norton: ‘If you’re a romantic like me, and every girl I know is, every girl wants to be swept off her feet by a knight in shining armour. Unfortunately we’re raised on those fairy tales. Greeting the crowd: Madonna appeared to show her age a little as she photographed from her profile . Lady of the night: Madonna opted for an all-black ensemble, with red details . ‘Even if we are sophisticated, . educated, intelligent, evolved human beings, we like to think in the . back of our minds that Mr Right is going to sweep us off our feet and . take us into the sunset, and we’re going to live happily ever after. ‘But we keep getting disappointed. If  you have even half a brain you know that doesn’t exist.’ When asked if she could see herself walking down the aisle again, Madonna, who has dated a number of high-profile men including John F Kennedy Jnr, replied: ‘I could actually, yes. ‘I think I’m a pretty good judge of character but I have made a few mistakes.’ The singer divorced Ritchie, 43, after eight years of marriage in 2008. He is  dating model Jacqui Ainsley and the couple had a baby son in September. While recording an interview for the . Irish presenter’s BBC show, to be shown tomorrow night, Madonna also . revealed that she was just like every other harassed mother of . teenagers. She told how her 15-year-old daughter Lourdes raids her wardrobe to steal her clothes and often shows her ‘no respect’. Interview: Graham Norton and Madonna during the filming of the Graham Norton Show at The London Studios, south London, to be aired on BBC One on Friday evening . Spilling the beans: Madonna told the presenter she was just like every other harassed mother of teenagers . She said: ‘She is 15 but she’s very sophisticated for her age. I don’t even have to ask and she gives me her opinion. 'I play her songs and say “what do you think. Like it, don’t like it? Cool, uncool?” She’s very opinionated. ‘If . I say to my daughter “that outfit is a little bit too risqué”, my . daughter will look at me and say,  “that’s rich coming from you”. ‘And she borrows my clothes a lot. She’s always sneaking into my room at six in the morning when I’m sleeping. New kid on the block: Emeli Sandé joins Madonna and the cast on the sofa . 'She loves these combat boots that I wear. Maybe she loans them to her friends because I don’t see them for weeks. ‘She doesn’t like the fact she still has a nanny, but I have four kids so I need someone to look after them. ‘My . nanny said “You’ve got to give your mum her boots back”. She said, . “whatever, she’ll get over it”. I was thinking, “Wow, she doesn’t hear . me at all”. I don’t care about the boots, it’s her attitude.’ Of . her other three children – Rocco, 11, David, six, and daughter Mercy, . also six, Madonna added: ‘When I’m at home with my children .... I hear . all the complaints and all the moaning, and I still have to threaten to . kill them if they won’t do their homework.’ Also today, Madonna took time to pose . with her co-stars for the W.E. London photocall, ahead of her red carpet . premiere in Kensington High Street. The Material Girl teamed an elegant . curve-hugging navy dress with fingerless biker gloves - although of . course they were emblazoned with large diamante Coco Chanel emblems.

She showed off her slender . physique in the tailored frock, that daringly gaped at the cleavage to . show a hint of black lace beneath. Her . trademark blonde tresses hung loosely around her shoulders, with the . Queen of Pop opting for neutral make-up to emulate an natural, . just-going-about-my-daily-business look.

Posing with the gang: Madonna puts her arms around James D'Arcy and Andrea Riseborough . Age ain't nothing but a number: Madonna looked the same age as 36-year-old D'Arcy . To coincide with tonight's premiere, the Golden Globe-winner has also announced the title of her 12th studio album is MDNA and that she will be going on tour again. During the interview with Norton, she said: 'I just have to pay the rent. A girl has to make a living, but truthfully I do enjoy it. Touring is the most rewarding of all my jobs.' The release of the new record has been tainted slightly by the leak of an early version of the first single, Gimme All Your Luvin' in November 2010, for which a Spanish man was arrested in December. Referring to the incident, Madonna joked: 'It's soon (the release date). It depends how quickly people hack in to my server and leak it. Can people wait? It's terrible.'",Singer was interviewd by Graham Norton in show to be broadcast on Friday .

For removal vans were pictured removing the stand-up comedian's belongings from their  luxurious Hollywood Hills mansion today. It is understood the California Gurls singer will be holding onto the $6.5 million property, and today it was being pared of her estranged husband's belongings. Moving out: A large removal van was seen leaving Katy Perry's Hollywood Hills house with her estranged husband Russell Brand's belongings today . A worker was seen opening the gate for the large Wetzel and Sons Moving and Storage truck. The truck was seen driving down the lavish property's long winding driveway until it came to the gate. The couple had purchased the home together just a few months ago. It was later seen pulling up at another large house in the Beverly Hills area, which appears to be camp comic Brand's new US home. The drop off: The truck was later seen at another property in the wealthy Beverly Hills area of California . Job done: Once it had finished its stop off at the expensive property the truck rolled down the long driveway . Once it had completed its rounds the truck was again spotted leaving the former Big Brother's Big Mouth presenter's flash new abode. However Russell was spotted on Monday enjoying lunch in London, and it is unclear whether he is back in the States yet. Brand announced on December 30 that he was filing for divorce from Perry, saying said: 'Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always adore her and I know we'll remain friends.' No way back: It looks like there is little chance of a shock reconciliation between the pair . It also recently emerged that he had taken off his wedding ring in a video he posted the video on porn website Nudevista as he began a week-long tour of various universities in America. After talking about how excited he is to visit college sororities, he is seen taking his ring off in full view of the camera, before adding: 'I'm just going to place this somewhere very, very safe for the next week.' It also emerged today that Brand is being tipped to face a comedic onslaught from irreverent Ricky Gervais when he hosts the Golden Globes on Sunday. Irish bookmaker Paddy Power taking bets on who he will turn his comedic eye on, and they are offering short odds on the couple becoming his verbal punchbag when he takes to the stage. At 5/1 they are favourites to be joshed ahead of the likes of Madonna at 11/2 and Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore at 10/1. Meanwhile Katy's father Rev Keith Hudson has apologised for making anti-Semitic remarks at a recent sermon at the Church on the Rise in Cleaveland, Ohio. He said: 'I deeply regret the hurtful and ugly language I used in my message in Ohio. 'We can do lots of harm even to those we . love simply by using words irresponsibly. I apologize for the hurt . that I caused my Jewish friends.' He added that he will not make such comments again. The church's Pastor Paul Endreialso defended Hudson, saying: 'Even though this is wrong and it was not a right comment, he wasn't preaching about Jews, neither was he ranting against Jews.' He added that he received only one complaint from among the roughly 300 people who heard the sermon, and that he would welcome Hudson back. Jewish human rights organisation The Simon Wiesenthal Center denounced the remarks as anti-Semitic earlier this week.

Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District Superintendent Kelly Bowers said Johnson was placed on administrative leave and that the district could not comment about its history with the teacher, but said: 'As always, while following due process guidelines, if we discover that any adult or staff member has placed a student at risk, we take appropriate, swift and decisive action. 'Safety of our students is our top priority.' Johnson is being held at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin on $1.85 million bail.",Most incidents allegedly took place in Marie Johnson's car .

The Jewish community is on alert after Molotov cocktails were thrown at a synagogue and ignited a fire inside the rabbi's residence - in what authorities are billing a hate crime and attempted murder. The attack on Congregation Beth El in Rutherford, New Jersey, on Wednesday was the fourth bias incident within a month against a Jewish religious institution or centre in the area, police revealed. Within the last three weeks, a fire was intentionally set at a synagogue in Paramus and anti-Semitic graffiti was discovered at synagogues in Hackensack and Maywood, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Children's playground: Bergen County officials walk on the ground of Congregation Beth El as authorities investigate an early morning fire on Wednesday in Rutherford, New Jersey . There is no evidence yet linking the four incidents but they still could be connected - and northern New Jersey residents should be vigilant but not afraid, Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said. The intentional early-morning fire could have been the work of more than one person and happened at 4:30am when incendiary devices were thrown at various parts of the large Victorian-style home. It houses Congregation Beth El on its ground floor and the rabbi's living area on the second level. Mr Molinelli said the attack was being classified as an attempted murder, after one of the devices was thrown through a second floor window and into the bedroom of the congregation's rabbi. ‘The manner in which this heinous crime has been committed has brought our office to really raise consciousness on this,’ he added. Inspection: Bergen County officials stand on the roof of Congregation Beth El. The fire occurred one day before officials and Jewish community leaders were scheduled to discuss three recent incidents in the area . Probe: A Bergen County Sheriff's investigator stands on a lift as markers sit on the roof of Congregation Beth El and authorities investigate the fire on Wednesday . ‘This is certainly a hate crime, this is certainly a bias crime, this is aggravated arson - but most importantly, we are now looking on this as an attempted homicide.’ 'The manner in which this heinous crime has been committed has brought our office to really raise consciousness on this' Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli . Mr Molinelli said authorities do not yet believe that the rabbi was personally targeted. A wide coalition of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, is participating in the investigation. The rabbi, his wife, five children and the rabbi's parents were sleeping when the fire occurred. But nobody was seriously hurt. Police said the device thrown through the rabbi's bedroom window did not explode, but ignited, and the rabbi suffered minor burns putting it out. Rabbi Nosson Schuman of Congregation Beth El told CBS 880 Radio that he saw a flash of fire outside his bedroom window before his bedspread caught fire.

It is set far back from the leafy, quiet street and has a large synagogue sign, a child's swing set and a trampoline in its front yard. The neighbourhood is ethnically diverse, and is dotted with houses of worship of several different religions. The prosecutor said northern New Jersey residents shouldn't be afraid, but should be vigilant, and that all religious institutions, not just those of the Jewish faith, should be on alert.

Etzion Neuer of the Anti-Defamation League, which has offered a $2,500 award for the arrest and conviction of a suspect, said they were very concerned about all four bias incidents. ‘We view these as part of a deeply troubling continuum that we pray will end now,’ Mr Neuer said. The synagogues in Maywood and Hackensack are about a mile apart. The other two are within about seven miles of each other in Bergen County, just across the Hudson River from New York City. The fire at Congregation K'Hal Adath Jeshuran in Paramus was discovered last Tuesday when members smelled gas in the building and contacted authorities. Fire and police officials determined an accelerant had been used in the rear of the building to start a fire. The fire had quickly burned itself out and no injuries were reported.

Former Labour ministers could face police questioning over Britain’s alleged role in the rendition of terror suspects into the hands of Colonel Gaddafi. Scotland Yard yesterday opened an investigation into claims MI6 officers were involved in illegally transferring the men to Libya where they were jailed and tortured. It is thought likely that former foreign secretary Jack Straw will be asked whether he or other ministers approved actions by agents of the Secret Intelligence Service. Libyan rebel commander Abdel Hakim Belhadj, left, and Sami al Saddi, right . The investigation will further delay the long-awaited inquiry by Sir Peter Gibson into all allegations of British complicity in torture during the War on Terror. Last night Whitehall sources suggested it could mean the inquiry being put on hold indefinitely while the police investigate. As police announced the probe yesterday, the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer confirmed no MI5 or MI6 officer will face charges over two separate, long-running investigations into complicity in torture. The complaint against the Security Service came from Binyam Mohamed, who said MI5 knew he was being mistreated when it handed over questions to his U.S. captors. Police found MI5 did pass information to the U.S. but said there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to prove any officer knew Mohamed was being tortured at the time. Prosecutors also concluded there was not enough evidence to prosecute an MI6 officer for aiding and abetting torture over an incident at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan in January 2002 when he interviewed a detainee. British Foreign Minister William Hague says the Government is committed to 'drawing a line' under claims of intelligence agency involvement in the torture of terrorist suspects held overseas . Investigators were unable to find the victim or any eye-witnesses and said there was ‘no realistic prospect’ of conviction. The latest rendition claims first emerged last year in secret documents found in the former headquarters of Gaddafi’s intelligence chief Musa Kusa. In one, former senior SIS officer Sir Mark Allen appeared to try to take credit for handing over intelligence which enabled the U.S. to capture a terror suspect Abdel Hakim Belhadj. Belhadj is a senior military figure . in the new Libyan government and is suing Britain over his torture at . the hands of Gaddafi’s henchmen. A . CIA document found at the same time suggested Britain had launched its . own operation to transfer another man, Abu Munthir, from Hong Kong to . Tripoli. At the time the revelations emerged, security sources suggested . the operations were authorised at ‘Secretary of State’ level. Solicitors .

"By . Stewart Maclean . Last updated at 6:57 PM on 12th January 2012 . Fourteen people were arrested today in South Africa after an elderly couple were burned to death by vigilantes who accused them of being witches. Grandparents Elsa Dubazane and Rafael Zukhulu, both 63, died on Wednesday after being attacked by a gang at their rural home. Police spokesman Jay Naicker said nine men and five women were arrested in the early hours of this morning in connection with the tragedy. The suspects, aged between 18 and 40, were today being questioned at a police station near the scene of the double murder in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province. Murdered: Rafael Zukhulu and Elsa Dubazane had been persecuted by members of their community who accused them of practising witchcraft . Colonel Naicker said: 'This was a terrible attack on two old people. 'Police were called to the couple's home early on Wednesday and discovered that they had been attacked and killed and that their home had been burned. 'Our investigations have suggested that this may have been a case where the community accused the victims of witchcraft. 'It seems a rumour went around the locality that they had been practising witchcraft. 'However there is no evidence to suggest that they were anything other than innocent victims.' Colonel Naicker said the 14 suspects would all be charged with two counts of murder and arson over the incident, which happened near the township of Ntuzuma around 20 miles north of Durban. Local media today reported that the couple were attacked by a mob who arrived at their home around 12.30am on Wednesday. Their tenant Simphiwe Dlamini told the Mercury newspaper she heard screams and saw the elderly pair's home ablaze. She said: 'I was asleep and my boyfriend woke me up after he heard loud screams. 'We went outside and saw that the granny's house had caught fire and a mob was standing outside.' Ms Dlamini said Mr Zukhulu fled the property but was captured by the gang, who allegedly burned him alive by hanging a blazing tyre around his neck. She added: 'The grandfather managed to escape, but they chased and caught him on the road. 'The mob then set a tyre alight and hung it around his neck while his grandson watched.' Councillor Mbuyiselwa Sibiya told the Mercury he received a call about the incident at 1.30am and called the police. But he said the officer feared for his life and refused to go to the scene. When officers did arrive later they discovered the couple's bedroom and kitchen burned to ashes. Colonel Naicker confirmed Mrs Dubazane's body was subsequently found in the bedroom at their home and her husband's laid outside on the street. Their seven year old grandson was taken away by police for his own safety. The Mercury reported that Wednesday's murders followed a previous attack on the couple last week. The frightened grandparents gave an interview to the newspaper at the weekend in which they told how they were assaulted on Friday by a gang armed with axes who accused them of witchcraft. Police said it appeared some members of the local community believed the elderly pair were somehow linked to the death of their granddaughter Zakude Shozi, 16, who died in hospital on January 3. Colonel Naicker said the investigation into the tragedy would continue and the suspects, who have not yet been named, would appear in court next week. Local officials have condemned the brutal murders. Sazi Mhlongo, chairman of the KwaZulu-Natal traditional healers board, told the Mercury he felt outraged over the tragedy. He added: 'This irritates me because people are killed without any proof or evidence that they practised witchcraft.' Belief in witchcraft remains common in many communities across Africa. Yesterday's deaths follow a string of previous recent attacks on suspected witches across the continent. Last year police in South Africa warned people not to take the law into their own hands if they suspected others of black magic.","Elsa Dubazane and Rafael Zukhulu killed at rural home .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 4:06 AM on 13th January 2012 . A brutal rapist who terrorised elderly women in a suburb for more than a decade was told today he will live out his days behind bars. Michael Roberts, 45, has become the first man to get a 'life means life' sentence for rape after raping three victims - one aged 83 - and viciously attacking a fourth in Bermondsey, south London. Known as the Bermondsey Beast, he evaded justice for 15 years but was captured after a cold case review by Scotland Yard using advances in DNA. Jailed: Michael Roberts, 45, joins a small group of 'life means life' prisoners after raping three victims - one aged 83 - and viciously attacking a fourth in Bermondsey, south London . Following a trial at Southwark Crown Court, the 45-year-old, of no fixed address, was given four life sentences by Judge Stephen Robbins. Judge Robbins said: 'I do sentence you to imprisonment for the rest of your natural life ... your utter depravity knows no bounds, these are very grave offences.' After the sentence was read out Roberts . said: ‘I will only say this my lord, I am absolutely not guilty and I . will...’ before he was dragged from the dock by prison guards. Roberts subjected his terrified victims to horrific ordeals . during a series of violent burglaries in south London in the late . 1980s. At the time, the crimes sparked nationwide outrage and mass media coverage but Roberts eluded capture. He has also been nicknamed ‘The Praying Rapist’ after crossing himself . and uttering the words from the Roman Catholic prayer for the dead . during one attack. Roberts was caught because he had given a DNA sample after attacking an elderly man in his own home. DNA matches from the scene threw up a partial match to his DNA in 2005 and it was realised he fitted a description of his now dead victims. In addition his . methods of attack matched that of some of his other many crimes which did not involve violence. Roberts struck for the first time on . Boxing Day 1988, breaking into the home of a 57-year-old woman in Lant Street, Southwark - 800 yards from his then home in Gaywood . Street. The woman was a virgin who had mobility problems. He beat her up and raped her before escaping with £75 and six packets of cigarettes. On September 11 1989, Roberts attacked a 77-year-old who lived in the same building in Lant Street. The pensioner was also a virgin and had difficulty getting around. Roberts raped her and stole £5 and lose change before he left the flat. On October 7 1989, Roberts, entered . the home of a 66-year-old woman in Rotherhithe and . raped her, before stealing two purses containing £30 in cash and a bank . card. Between February 28 and 2 March 1990, . he burgled the home of an 83-year-old woman in Keetons Estate, Rotherhithe, beating her up severely and stealing her . pension book and bank card as well as a handbag. The addresses of the third and fourth victims were within 300 yards of his address at the time in St James’ Road. Jurors unanimously convicted Roberts of three rapes and the brutal beating of a fourth victim following a short trial last month. Although he was only tried for four . attacks, he has been blamed for other similar crimes . during the same period, including the rape and murder of 68-year-old . Irene Grainey. The grandmother was sexually attacked and stabbed to death with a kitchen knife on May 31, 1990. Her body lay undiscovered for six weeks at her council maisonette in Rotherhithe, May 31, 1990. After the jury delivered its verdicts the court heard Roberts had been . linked to two other violent attacks on victims aged 68 and 78 in 1989. But the murder of Mrs Grainey remained unsolved. Judge Stephen Robbins, likening the case to the case of ‘Night Stalker’ Delroy Grant and said: ‘Your depravity knows no bounds. ‘These are very grave offences. The victims of your offences were all elderly. You broke into their houses and in the middle of the night. ‘You then proceeded to submit them to humiliating and degrading sexual . attacks and, unlike Delroy Grant, your offences are aggravated and . marked by terrible violence. ‘I’m quite satisfied that you are a danger to society therefore I do . sentence you to imprisonment for the rest if your natural life.’ Roberts appeared . in the dock wearing light beige trousers and a black shirt. He evaded capture hiding a distinctive scar on his forehead from his victims by wearing his hair in a floppy fringe and warning the victims not to look at his face. But other features gave him away, including his back, which one of the women accurately said was covered in brown marks and moles, and his clothing, including a dirty green tracksuit. His fourth victim was so badly beaten that she remembered nothing about her attacker. Roberts confessed that assault to his girlfriend at the time after hearing it reported on the radio, the jury heard. Jurors at Southwark Crown Court unanimously convicted Roberts of three rapes and the brutal beating of a fourth victim following a short trial last month . Material recovered from the attacker’s semen and saliva from cigarettes he smoked only provided ‘partial’ matches to Roberts’ profile, with a one in 79,000 chance that it did not come from him in one sample down to as much as a one in 16 chance in another. But prosecutor Allison Hunter said all the evidence taken together, with partial matches found at three different scenes, alongside the visual identifications, the confession to his girlfriend and other circumstantial evidence, the jury could be sure he was the attacker. Judge Stephen Robbins likened the case to the 'Night Stalker' Delroy Grant, pictured, who attacked pensioners over 17 years . Roberts lived within a few hundred yards of all four victims, and staked out their homes prior to the attacks. He chose elderly woman living alone in ground floor flats, and attacked them in their homes late at night before making off with small amounts of cash and jewellery. His victims described how he smelled strongly of alcohol, and told one of them he had been at the pub before the attack. The jury heard evidence from the two women Roberts lived with during the period of the attacks - Julie Warner and Leanne Ward. He had been violent to both women and Miss Ward described in a statement how he was a petty criminal who would often return home late at night with handbags he had stolen. She told the court he used to scan newspapers for coverage of his exploits, believing at the time that he was referring to lesser crimes. Miss Ward also said she remembered he owned a pale green tracksuit similar to that described by one of the victims. Miss Warner said that after hearing about the fourth attack on the radio, the savage beating of an 83-year-old woman, he told her: ‘I did that, but I didn’t rape her.’ Although he did not give evidence during the trial, Roberts’ barrister Ali Bajwa, QC, told the jury in his closing speech that the Crown had not produced enough evidence to prove he had committed the offences. Roberts, formerly of St James’ Road, Rotherhithe, was convicted of three counts of rape, four counts of burglary, two counts of indecent assault, two counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, and one count of buggery. Speaking outside court, a son of one . of his victims said: 'Today’s sentence for the families is absolutely . brilliant. He deserves everything he got.' Detective Inspector Nathan Eason, one . of the investigating officers on the case, said: 'Michael Roberts is a . sexual predator who preyed on vulnerable women in the late 80s and early . 90s. 'Unfortunately none of his victims . lived to see him being brought to justice today but the family members . of the victims have expressed deep satisfaction with handed down today.

The number of stop and searches carried out by the Metropolitan Police is set to fall dramatically as the force aims to improve its relationship with the black community. Scotland Yard confirmed today that Section 60 orders, which permit random stop and searches, are set to be cut by half. The decision comes after Scotland Yard Commissioner Bernard . Hogan-Howe described random searches as 'a real challenge' for the force. Changes: The number of stop and searches carried out by Metropolitan Police officers is set to fall by half in a bid to improve relations with the black community . A spokesman said: 'The aim is to decrease the number of times senior officers grant authority for stop and searches. 'It could be that there are just as many stops but they'll be more effective.' Figures currently show that more than 90 per cent of stoppages fail to lead to arrest. Chiefs have outlined new targets that aim to halve the number of times they fail to find drugs during searches, while raising the arrest rate to 20 per cent. Decision: Bernard Hogan-Howe previously described stop and search as 'a real challenge' and has now signed off the new approach . The debate into the success of the searches has raged for years among politicians, police and the communities. Critics say it alienates young people in ethnic minority communities, while supporters say the tactic is a deterrent to rising youth violence and teenage murders. The Metropolitan Police spokesman added: 'Last year, there were 1,753 Section 60 authorities. 'Within these 1,753 authorities, there were around 51,000 searches. 'If we raise the threshold for a Section 60, we might not necessarily see fewer searches. 'It could be that there's a stronger case to do a S60 authority and in that authority, we do search more people. 'It is the number of authorities that is being targeted.' Mr Hogan-Howe has signed off the 'implementation of a new approach which will see a dedicated, experienced central team lead a wide range of changes affecting every element of stop and search with the aim of improving policy, practice and performance across the board.' The force added: 'This new approach will see a renewed focus on reducing violence, as this is one of the key issues communities tell us they want us to tackle, as well as an enhancement of our intelligence-led targeting. 'We will aim to be more effective by increasing positive outcomes across key categories from arrest rates to seizures of weapons.'","Number of searches set to be cut by half .

The new SpyEye 'trojan horse' software steals your card details - then when you log into your online bank, it adjusts your balance so you don't realise anything is wrong. It's already been found in the U.S. and the UK . A new version of the SpyEye 'trojan horse' software not only steals your money, it then offers false reassurance that it's still there. When you visit your online bank, there will be no trace of the transactions that cyber-criminals are using to empty your bank account. Worse, your balance will also be adjusted on screen so it looks as if nothing is happening. The attack - on Windows PCs - has already been detected in the U.S. and the UK. The software - which steals your bank passwords to give access to your account - waits for you to enter the same banking details before 'adjusting' what you see. The idea is that it gives thieves more time to use your debit card details on fraudulent transactions without you realising it's happening. The first you'll learn of the attack is your bank refusing you money, or a paper statement showing you that cyber criminals have been draining money out of your account. The new version of SpyEye has targeted banks in the U.S. and the UK. Trusteer, a security company which detected the attack, says, 'The next time the victim visits their online banking site, the malware hides the fraudulent transactions, as well as artificially changing the total balance.' 'As a result, the deceived customer has no idea that their account has been ‘taken over’, nor that any fraudulent transactions have taken place.' The software, a variant on a commonly used cyber attack, has been 'tweaked' so that as well as its usual attack - grabbing passwords and login information from your web browser without you knowing, it also adjusts your balance when you next visit your bank's web page. 'SpyEye is a tweak of the Zeus crimeware kit that grabs web form data within browsers,' says the Naked Security blog at web security experts Sophos. 'This year, right before the recent holiday season, Trusteer found a hopped-up version of SpyEye attacking banks in the U.S. and U.K. 'The new Trojan, instead of intercepting or diverting email messages, hides bogus transactions even after users have logged out and then logged back into their accounts.' 'This version of SpyEye both hides the fraudulent transaction and masks the amount of the transaction, putting forward a fake balance and ensuring that victims are oblivious to anything being amiss.' With hi-tech cyber attacks such as SpyEye, there are few visible signs that anything is wrong. There are defences, though - ensure your browser is up to date, manually updating it if necessary. You should also ensure that the 'anti-phishing' option is switched to 'on' in Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, which will check for 'blacklisted' websites and prevent your browser being directed to the 'fake' version that delivers your bank statement.","Crimeware steals passwords from your browser .

Killings dropped by 3.6 per cent in 2010 and were overtaken at number 15 by a respiratory illness called pneumonitis that is seen mainly in people aged 75 and older, government health officials said. This is the first time since 1965 that homicide failed to make the list - and the news comes as U.S. life expectancy hit a new record high of 78.7 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Decreasing threat: Homicide dropped by 3.6 per cent in 2010 and was overtaken by a respiratory illness called pneumonitis that is seen mainly in people aged 75 and older, health officials said (file picture) The infant mortality rate dropped to an all-time low of 6.14 deaths per 1,000 births in 2010, after it stood at 6.39 per 1,000 in 2009, according to the CDC's latest annual report on deaths. Homicides fell to 5.3 cases for every 100,000 people. ‘Most of the changes were positive,’ report author Sherry Murphy, of the National Center of Health Statistics, told CNN. Meanwhile U.S. life expectancy for a child born in 2010 was about 78 years and 8 months, up about a little more than one month from life expectancy for 2009. The national death rate fell to 746 deaths for every 100,000 people in 2010, from 750 in 2009. Down: The age-adjusted death rate fell to 746 deaths for every 100,000 people in 2010, from 750 in 2009 . Heart disease and cancer remain the . top killers, accounting for nearly half the nation's 2,465,932 deaths in . 2010. But the death rates from them continued to decline. Deaths . rates for five other leading causes of death also dropped in 2010, . including strokes, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, . flu or pneumonia and blood infections. But death rates increased for Alzheimer's disease - the nation's sixth-leading killer - for kidney disease (#8), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (#12), Parkinson's disease (#14) and pneumonitis. Homicide has historically ranked fairly low on the list. Its highest ranking in the past decade was 13th in 2001 - and that was due in part to the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington D.C. Murder rates have been decline in recent years in New York City; Detroit, Michigan; Washington D.C. and elsewhere. New York saw 499 murders in 2011, which was down from 523 in 2010. Murders there in 2010 were up 13 per cent - but the figure was still the fourth lowest since city records began in 1962. The record low was 471 in 2009 and the record high was 2,245 in 1990. There were 297 homicides in Los Angeles, California, last year - which is a massive drop from when more than 1,000 killings happened in 1992 during the city's major drug epidemic, reported NPR. It was long thought that violent crime increased in a troubled economy, which happened in the 1970s, but criminologists say the recent declines could simply be thanks to better police work.","Killings dropped by 3.6 per cent in 2010; overtaken by respiratory illness .

The siblings were born from the same batch of embryos created during their parents’ IVF treatment. But while Reuben was successfully implanted in 2006, seven-week-old Floren was kept on ice until last year. Delight: Simon and Jody, who underwent fertility treatment, with their two children . You took your time! Reuben Blake, five, with his twin sister Floren (seven weeks). They were conceived from the same batch of embryos . Now their parents, Jody and Simon, delight in telling well-wishers all about the incredible age gap between their ‘twins’. ‘I tell everybody I can,’ said Mr Blake, a business lecturer. ‘People take an interest in a newborn baby and with Reuben around as well, I find it very difficult to resist the temptation to say “Oh and by the way, they are twins”. ‘It’s almost just to see people’s response. They are really amazed and surprised.’ His wife, a charity worker, added: ‘It does feel quite surreal. ‘I think people are really, really surprised and it almost takes them a few minutes to get their heads around it. ‘We obviously had nine months to get it straight and to think “Gosh, we’re having Reuben’s twin”, but it’s incredibly special.’ Reuben tells friends his sister was 'kept in a freezer' Mrs Blake, 38, and her 45-year-old husband began fertility treatment in 2005. During the medical process, five embryos were created and two implanted in Mrs Blake, which resulted in the birth of Reuben on December 9, 2006. The remaining three embryos were frozen until the couple, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, decided to try for another child in March last year. Only one of the embryos survived the defrosting process and 39 weeks later Floren arrived by Caesarean section. Reuben is fascinated by his little sister. ‘He knows that she’s been in the freezer,’ said Mrs Blake. ‘He likes to say she has been in the freezer with the chips and the chicken, so he is sort of aware that she is his twin, but obviously he doesn’t really understand how it’s all worked. ‘They do look very similar. Reuben was just a bigger version of Floren when he was born, so certainly there are similarities physically.’ Recalling their decision to try for a second child, Mr Blake said: ‘We wanted to complete the family. We were aware the odds were long. ‘You just can’t comprehend that a life could come from some material that’s been frozen for that length of time.’ Doctors who treated the Blakes at the Bristol Centre for Reproductive Medicine said the decision to freeze remaining IVF embryos was a safer way to have more than one child. Lead clinician Dr Valentine Akande said: ‘We very often recommend storing surplus embryos  so that they can be used at a  later date. ‘Sadly, due to the chance work of nature, not everybody is able to have those surplus embryos and, of course, not everybody meets with success when they are used.’ Happy family: Simon and Jody with their twins Ruben and Floren .",Reuben and Floren were conceived at the same time but born five years apart .

A former Essex county fast bowler has become the first English cricketer to admit his part in a match-fixing scam after pleading guilty to corruption at the Old Bailey today. Mervyn Westfield, 23, was paid £6,000 by a betting syndicate to bowl in a way that would allow a certain number of runs to be scored from his first over, the court heard. He admits accepting the money, but claims he did not carry out the request. The agreed number of runs was 12, but only 10 were scored during his first six balls in the Natwest Pro40 game against Durham on September 5, 2009. He also admitted he ‘received numerous approaches’ to concede runs for cash and was actually asked to fix a game. He claims he thought about the offers and declined. His barrister, Mark Milliken-Smith QC, told the hearing: ‘A certain amount of runs were supposed to be given away in the first over that was bowled. They were not.’ The court heard the fixer who set up the spot-fixing scam is a well-known name in world cricket. Judge Anthony Morris QC said: ‘It seems the alleged corrupter is a person whose name is known to me and I’m sure known to many people interested in cricket.’ Westfield, of Martin Drive, Rainham, Essex, said he agreed to the scam and took the money to do so, but did not keep up his side of the bargain. He was caught when he 'unguardedly' confessed to a fellow player. The case comes after world cricket was brought to its knees by a spot-fixing scandal which saw three Pakistani test players and their British agent jailed last year. Caught out: Westfield (centre) was arrested after confessing his indiscretions to a fellow player . The plot involved two players deliberately bowling no balls at specific points in the match. Mitigating for Westfield, Mr Milliken-Smith, said: ‘Having had the money, he did his best to keep his side of the bargain, but failed.’ He said the cricketer was either unable to do as he agreed or was attempting to trap the fixers. ‘The aim was to snare for future activity,' he added. 'The reality is, on any view, he didn’t do what he was supposed to have done. ‘The case against Westfield is based almost entirely on what he told fellow players. ‘Of course, concentrating solely on the prosecution case for the moment, a certain amount of runs were supposed to have been given away in the first over that was bowled and they weren’t. ‘It is not just the defendant’s word. There is certainly no evidence that he did.' In action: Westfield celebrates a wicket for Essex during the Natwest Pro40 match against Hampshire in September 2009 . Neither the player to whom Westfield confessed, nor the alleged corrupter were identified in court. Mr Milliken-Smith said Westfield had no previous convictions, but accepted that the matter could result in a prison term. But he will argue his client should be given a suspended sentence when he returns to court on February 10, he added. Adjourning for sentence, Judge Morris told Westfield: ‘I hold up no promises as to the eventual outcome of this case. ‘Certainly it is open to the court in cases such as this to pass an immediate custodial sentence.’ Westfield, whose father is due to undergo an operation for prostate cancer next week, was granted unconditional bail. A separate charge of assisting another person to cheat at gambling was ordered to lie on file. Westfield is the first professional . cricketer in England to face prosecution for his involvement in spot . fixing in a County Cricket match, Essex Police said today. Awaiting sentence: Westfield (pictured after his court appearance) faces jail after admitting corruption charges. He has been released on unconditional bail . A spokesman said that although it was centred on the domestic game, it would have 'far-reaching consequences' for world cricket. The prosecution, which relates to a match played on September 5, 2009, involved the first use of Prevention of Corruption legislation within the context of a sporting event, the force said. A number of agencies assisted with the investigation, including the International Cricket Council, the England and Wales Cricket Board, Essex County Cricket Club and the UK Gambling Commission. Detective Sergeant Paul Lopez, of Essex Police, said: 'We hope this sends a strong message to professional sportsmen and women around the country - if they intend to get involved in spot-fixing, or think that match-fixing is not a crime, they need to think again.' Angus Porter, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, welcomed Westfield's decision to enter a guilty plea. 'I'm not sure that court cases necessarily are very helpful, but the fact that he has admitted to the crime can only act as a signal to others that sport needs to be treated with respect and played properly, at any level,' he said. 'Our view on it is that the world has moved on quite a long way since he committed those offences. 'We've invested a huge amount in educating players as to their responsibilities, but I think that none of us can be complacent. 'I think that we are all very mindful of the need to make sure that sport is played properly.' Behind bars: Pakistan cricketers (left to right) bowler Mohammad Amir, bowler Mohammad Asif and former captain Salman Butt, who were jailed last year after being convicted of a spot-fixing scam that shocked world cricket . Asked if county players, who generally earn less than international cricketers, were especially susceptible to approaches, he said: 'I'm not convinced that we know who the high-risk groups are. 'There is no doubt that where there are threats of corruption they will be linked to gambling and that gambling will predominantly be on televised games. 'International cricket certainly is a risk and I think domestic cricket is also a risk because some games are televised on the Indian sub-continent so I suppose those specific matches are the ones we need to worry about.' Westfield was released by Essex and now plays club cricket for Wanstead. Last year, former captain Salman Butt, 27, plotted with pace bowlers Mohammad Asif, 28, and rising star Mohammad Amir, 19, to deliberately bowl three no balls at the Lords test against England in August 2010. Butt was jailed for 30 months; Asif received 12 months and Amir was locked up for six months. Crooked businessman Mazhar Majeed, 36, was locked up for two years and eight months after the scandal was exposed by undercover News of the World reporter Mazhar Mahmood.","Mervyn Westfield took £6,000 to allow certain number of runs from over .

"By . Claire Ellicott and Katherine Faulkner . Last updated at 3:45 PM on 10th January 2012 . Emergency: Zac's parent's are taking him to Germany for immediate treatment . A mother yesterday flew her son to Germany for a lifesaving operation after two NHS hospitals delayed his treatment for lack of beds. Fearing another 11th-hour cancellation, Sam Knighton has spent £10,000 taking Zac abroad for immediate treatment for neuroblastoma, a form of cancer. The seven-year-old will be operated on tomorrow at the University Hospital Greifswald in an attempt to remove three diseased lymph nodes. Last night, Miss Knighton, 43, told the Daily Mail: ‘I feel like Zac’s country has let him down. 'I have had to fight, argue and question everything along the way to help my son. ‘I just hope we’re in time – it could already be too late. 'I dread to think what would have happened if we’d stayed in England.’ Zac began showing symptoms of the disease in October 2008. He saw two GPs, both of whom missed the neuroblastoma, passing the swelling off as a stomach upset. Finally, a third GP referred him for tests. Zac was diagnosed with grade four neuroblastoma, a cancer of the developing nervous tissue. There was a 5in-long tumour in his stomach. Miss Knighton said: ‘The specialist came . in to examine Zac. He lifted up his T-shirt and said: 'How in God’s . name did two doctors miss that?'' Zac was referred to Leicester Royal . Infirmary where he began chemotherapy in March 2009 and then a procedure . to remove the tumour. The hospital told Miss Knighton and . her partner Bob Smith, 42, a forklift truck driver, there could still be . ‘residual disease’ around the tumour site. Tragic: Cousins Chelsea Knighton when she was aged three pictured left and Zac pictured right, when he was aged five, were both diagnosed with neuroblastoma . No other option: Zac, pictured centre with his parents, Bob Smith left, and Sam Knighton, right who are taking him abroad for a lifesaving operation . More chemotherapy followed but a delay for a separate illness meant Zac missed the deadline for a vital course of antibody therapy. The NHS paid for this in Germany where doctors removed a tumour near Zac’s heart that surgeons at Leicester had deemed too dangerous to treat. Incredibly, the UK medics had not told Zac’s family about it. Miss Knighton added: ‘I feel the NHS has let my son down at every stage. It is incredible that I have to go to Germany. ‘It is disgusting that this country . doesn’t offer everything it can to save these children. It’s like we . live in a third world country.’ Although . Zac was given the all-clear in February 2011, a follow-up scan in May . in Germany showed three diseased lymph nodes in his abdomen. Drug treatment failed and the family was . told last month that Zac needed another operation. Although a surgeon . was available at Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre on December 22, no . paediatric beds were free until January 19. Miss Knighton’s complaints saw her offered an operation at Leicester on January 4. But this was cancelled barely half an hour before Zac left for hospital. Again, a bed shortage was blamed. ‘I phoned the consultant in Germany and he could do it right away,’ Miss Knighton said. ‘I just got straight on the phone to book flights. It was my son’s life and I didn’t care how much it cost. ‘Every day counts with this disease and I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if the NHS delay cost him his life.’ Johannes Visser, a consultant paediatric oncologist at Leicester who has been caring for Zac since 2009, said: . ‘Unfortunately, . our unit was extraordinarily busy with critically ill children needing . help to breathe, so his operation was rescheduled.’ A . spokesman for Nottingham University Hospitals said: ‘The first date we . offered for Zac’s operation was January 19, which the family have chosen . not to accept, and therefore we haven’t cancelled any surgery.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We understand the Trust is looking into this case. We would expect the NHS at local level to make sure they have the right number of paediatric intensive care beds to meet the demands of their local population. 'In keeping with the rest of the NHS in England, the local health service in the East Midlands is receiving annual real terms increases in funding in each year of this Parliament.'","Parents have spent £10,000 taking Zac abroad for immediate treatment for neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer that only affects children .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 1:20 PM on 3rd January 2012 . These are the three children who miraculously survived after a father lost control of his car last weekend on a winding canyon road and slid into an icy river, trapping them inside. Roger Andersen’s car slid into the water in Logan, Utah, flipped upside down and quickly became submerged - trapping his daughter Mia, 9, son Baylor, 4, and their friend, Kenya Wildman, 9. ‘The first thought was, ""So this is it how it ends"",’ the 46-year-old said on Monday. ‘This could very easily have been a funeral for four of us.’ But it wasn’t, thanks to a handful of heroic passers-by. Survivors: Kenya Wildman, Mia Andersen and Baylor Andersen (left-to-right) pose for a photo on Monday in Logan, Utah. The girls were rescued from an overturned car that was submerged in an icy river on Saturday . ‘I was amazed at the people and the readiness of people to jump in and help,’ he said. ‘Without hesitation they just did what they had to do (which), for our family, made all the difference.’ The witnesses stopped and jumped into the frigid river to help within seconds. Mr Andersen said they were on their way to a ski resort on Saturday when the accident happened on a treacherous road. They had travelled on it hundreds of times and it didn't appear icy at first - but as they made their way up the canyon, it got slicker so he slowed. Just one tap on the brakes was all it took. ‘In a second, I was completely off the road and sliding down the embankment,’ he said. ‘Within a second, the entire cabin of the vehicle was full of water.’ He struggled and failed to free the children from their seatbelts - and he needed to breathe. Emotional: Roger Andersen, left, and his wife Mindy Andersen speak at Logan Regional Hospital, in Logan, Utah. Mr Andersen lost control of the car he was driving and it was submerged in an icy river . ‘I decided the best thing was to get out of the car and get air,’ he said. ‘In no less than 10 seconds, there were a half-dozen men standing on the banks of the river. 'The first thought was, ""So this is it how it ends"". This could very easily have been a funeral for four of us' Roger Andersen . ‘Their questions to me were: “Who else was in the car?” ‘Within five seconds, there were eight men in the river... ready to assist.’ The rescuers pulled the children from the car and passed them up the river bank to others, where some performed CPR on two of them - his children. They were unconscious and not breathing. They all loaded up into a friend's SUV . and sped down the mountain for help, but were met about halfway by . paramedics, Mr Andersen said. His . two children were flown to a hospital in Salt Lake City, treated for . hypothermia and released on Monday. The family friend also was treated . and released. Potential disaster: The witnesses stopped and jumped into the frigid river to help within seconds . ‘In a matter of a couple of days, now Baylor is running around just like nothing ever happened to him, and Mia is fine and Kenya is also fine,’ he said. ‘It's a story to me that is inspiring in many ways.’ 'I was amazed at the people and the readiness of people to jump in and help' Roger Andersen . He said he will now learn more about how to help others. ‘I need to do more so I can be at that level where I can step in and help people,’ Mr Andersen said. Kenya's father, Dennis Wildman, called . it ‘a great story about the human spirit’. The bystanders who helped . ‘literally brought our children home to us,’ he said, adding: ‘We just . want to say thank you.’ Former . police officer Chris Willden was among the first on the scene. He said . he shot out one of the car's windows with his pistol to reach the trapped . kids. ‘I was trying to grab arms, but I couldn't feel anything,’ Mr Willden said. ‘I'm thinking ... 'What are we going to do?'‘ . Heroes: As many as 10 passers-by jumped in to flip the car back over and rescue three young children inside . Hero: Former police officer Chris Willden was among the first on the scene. He said he shot out one of the car's windows with his pistol to reach the trapped kids . He saw at least eight other people had scrambled down the 10ft embankment along U.S. 89 to help. '""Hero"" is not even big enough for what they did' Mindy Andersen . ‘I remember thinking to myself, “You're going to see some dead kids, get ready”,’ Mr Willden said. ‘I've got three of my own and it was going to be (an awful) start to the New Year.’ One of the girls had found an air pocket but was trapped by her seat belt. Mr Willden cut it with a pocket knife and pulled her from the rear passenger window. The two other children soon followed. Mr Andersen's wife, Mindy, fought to keep from crying on Monday as she thanked the bystanders for saving the children's lives. ‘”Hero” is not even big enough for what they did,’ she said.","Roger Anderson's car slid into water off icy canyon road in Logan, Utah .

"By . Arthur Martin . Last updated at 10:53 AM on 3rd September 2011 . Free: The case against Rebecca Leighton, linked to the deaths of three patients, has been dropped . The nurse charged over an alleged murder plot involving tampering with saline drips walked free last night. Rebecca Leighton said: ‘I have been living in hell and was locked up in prison for something I had not done.’ The 27-year-old was held over the poisoning in which seven patients at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, died and up to 40 patients were affected in June and July. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case against her  yesterday, saying it was ‘no longer appropriate’ for them to pursue a prosecution. Miss Leighton's solicitor Carl Richmond was flanked by her parents outside the family home as he read a statement from her. She said:'First and foremost I would wish to thank with all my heart all of those people who have supported me and have not given up on me and never doubted my innocence during this living nightmare. 'If it was not for the unerring love and support of my family, my mum Lynda, dad David and brother Darren, my fiance Tim, and all my friends, I do not know how I would have coped. 'I would also like to thank the members of the public who have also supported me and have believed in my innocence. 'I have been living in hell and was locked up in prison for something I had not done. 'Nonetheless, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the staff at HMP Styal for their love and support. 'It was so frustrating for me knowing that the person who has actually carried out these terrible acts is still out there.. Victims:Tracey Arden, 44, George Keep, 84, and Arnold Lancaster, 71, who died at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport . Derek Weaver, 83, and Vera Pearson, 84, whose deaths are linked to saline poisoning . 'My life has been turned upside down. All I ever wanted to do was to pursue a profession in nursing and to care for my patients. 'I think it is unbelievable that anyone in the medical profession would ever put patients' lives at risk.' Family and friends of Rebecca Leighton never doubted her innocence. Neighbours did not have a bad word to says about the nurse who shared a flat in Heaviley, Stockport with fiance Tim Papworth above the darts shop he owns. They described her as 'popular', 'lovely', 'nice', 'wouldn't hurt a fly.' Messages of support poured in via Facebook. Her parents, David and Lynda, attended her first court appearance at Manchester Magistrates' Court. Walking hand in hand with them was Mr Papworth. It was also revealed she had received 'considerable support' from ex-patients. Anyone visiting the Facebook page of the former Open University student would have seen numerous photographs of a happy-go-lucky young woman who enjoyed an active social life. The only theme among her Facebook wall updates which revealed this fun-loving character was the many messages referring to her feeling tired from work and long night shifts at the hospital. Miss Leighton had been charged with contaminating the saline drips and also with theft of medical supplies. The . contamination charges have now been dropped because of lack of . sufficient evidence and the theft charge was dropped because it was not . in the public interest to continue. At . a bail application last month, lawyers representing Miss Leighton said . the case against her was ‘weak’. But her appeal then to be released . before an anticipated plea hearing in mid-October was rejected at . Manchester Crown Court on the grounds of her own protection. Yesterday . the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West, Nazir Afzal, said it was . ‘no longer appropriate’ to continue the case against Miss Leighton. He said: ‘She was charged on the basis . that there was a reasonable suspicion that she had committed the . offences and there were reasonable grounds for believing the . investigation would provide further evidence within a reasonable period . of time. ‘The inquiries have not provided us with a stronger case which would meet the test of a realistic prospect of conviction. ‘There is the prospect that further . evidence may emerge which we would consider. The law does allow us to . reinstate charges in those circumstances, particularly where the . allegations are serious.’ Miss Leighton remains suspended from . her job at the hospital. Her registration has been withdrawn by the . Nursing and Midwifery Council pending an internal investigation. Last night, at her parents’ home, in . Denton, Tameside, her mother, also a nurse, said the last few . weeks had been a ‘nightmare’. She added: ‘We just want to be left in peace now so we can get on with our lives.’ Family: Parents Lynda and David Leighton with their daughter's solicitor Carl Richmond . Unsolved: Police are continuing to investigate the deaths at Stepping Hill Hospital, which occurred in July . Police insisted they weren’t back to ‘square one’. Assistant Chief Constable Terry . Sweeney of Greater Manchester Police said the investigation - one of the most complex since the 1996 bombing of the Arndale Centre by the IRA -  may continue . for many months. He added: ‘This is one of the most challenging and . complex investigations we have faced. ‘We have to work within a crime scene . which is a very busy hospital where staff, visitors and patients have . some degree of access to products within the hospital.’ Officers have interviewed 200 out of . 700 people they want to speak to. Their list includes hospital staff, . patients and visitors. He added: ‘All these people who came . into the contact of the hospital were particularly poorly people so we . have to understand the impact of contamination, although we are clear . there was contamination in a number of saline products.’ George Arden, brother of Tracey Arden, . one of the victims, said that he believed police would find the person . who killed his sister. Asked what he thought about Miss . Leighton being freed, he said: ‘It doesn’t make any difference. I don’t . know the facts and I don’t know what happened. I think the police will . find the right person.’","Police still to interview hundreds in connection with the case .

The body found on the Queen’s estate at Sandringham could be a girl as young as 15, police said yesterday. And fears were growing that it could be a 17-year-old student missing in the area since last August. A murder investigation was launched after the remains were discovered by a dog walker in a copse close to where the Royal Family had gathered for their  Boxing Day shoot. Yesterday police described the body as . that of a white woman, aged between 15 and 23. The body had been lying . on the Norfolk estate for between one month and four months. Detectives are examining missing person cases to see if they can find a match. These include the disappearance of Alisa Dmitrijeva, 17, who went missing shortly after midnight on August 31 last year. She was last spotted in a green Lexus GS800 car in the centre of King’s Lynn, about ten miles from where the body was found. The 5ft 6in Latvian-born student was reported missing a week later by a . relative. Detectives said she often stayed with friends for several . days, but previously had always remained in touch with her family while . she was away. Scroll down for video .

Police say the circumstances suggest that the woman was murdered and are now looking at cold case files across the country . Last month police put up a £5,000 reward for information which would help locate her. Officers also distributed posters with her photograph and created a . Facebook advert in a bid to track her down, translating it into Latvian . and Lithuanian. They also trawled through hours of CCTV images and made numerous house-to-house inquiries. Alisa lived with her father Olegs Dmitrijeva, her sister Victoria,  ten, . and grandmother Lidija Nesterova, 62, in a rented semi-detached  house . in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. She was due to enroll on a new course at the College of West Anglia the day after she disappeared. Yesterday her grandmother said she had been visited by police and told . that the body of an unidentified young woman had been found at . Sandringham. But Mrs Nesterova continues to cling on to the hope that her . granddaughter is still alive. Fighting back tears, she said: ‘Alisa is . missing. Alisa is not dead.’ A neighbour, who asked not to be named, added: ‘Alisa seemed like a nice . girl. I last saw her in August just before she disappeared. The remains were found by a dog-walker in woods at the village of Anmer . Missing: Another missing East European from Cambridgeshire, 29-year-old Lithuanian Vitalija Baliutaviciene, is also a possible victim . 'Once she was at home playing some “thump, thump music” which was . disturbing my wife, who was poorly. I went round to ask her to turn it . down. ‘To be fair to her, she said sorry and turned it down which was nice of . her. 'After she went missing, I had the police round asking questions . about her.’ Another neighbour, Ricardo Moreira, 32, said: ‘The police came round . three times asking about her when she disappeared. I couldn’t help . because I did not know her. ‘The Latvian community tend not to mix with other people in  Wisbech. They just socialise in their own groups.’ Norfolk Police are waiting for a DNA profile of the victim. They are . finding it hard to identify the body because it is significantly . decomposed and there were no identification documents found at the . scene. Another possible victim is another East Euorpean from Cambridgeshire, 29-year-old Vitalija Baliutaviciene. Lithuanian Ms Baliutaviciene, of Peterborough, also went missing on August 12, and has not been seen since 5am that day. Rimas Venclovas, 46, who was extradited from Lithuania, has been charged with her kidnap and murder but no body has been found. Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said: ‘We will be focusing on all . local missing persons and then spread our catchment area depending on . how our investigation goes. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are currently in residence at the estate (pictured), accompanied by the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their two young children . Macabre discovery: The human remains were found on the Queen's estate at Sandringham less than a mile from where the Royal family gathered for Christmas (bottom left) Sandringham is the private country estate of Her Majesty the Queen. It is the property of the British royal family and not part of the Crown Estate. In 1862, Sandringham hall was purchased by Queen Victoria at the request of the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII). But the Prince decide it was too small and had it knocked down and the current house built on the site. King George VI was born at York Cottage on the estate and died in 1952 at the house. Since then Queen Elizabeth spends the anniversary of her father's death and her own Accession privately with her family at the house. It is her official base until February each year and she is joined by the rest of the Royal family over Christmas. The house was first opened to the public in 1977, and there is a museum with displays of Royal life and Estate history. 'Part of the post-mortem will try to . establish the identification through fingerprints or DNA which may help . us identify who the victim is more quickly. ‘Hopefully in the next day or so we will have a good idea who we are dealing with and that may open fresh lines of inquiry. ‘I cannot confirm whether she was clothed because, at the moment, only . my staff, the person who found the body and the person or people who put . it there know that – and I would like it to stay that way. ‘It is very early days on the forensic side of things. 'It could be a challenging investigation. ‘We ask the public to cast their minds back to see if they can remember anything.’ Officers yesterday continued to search the area around where the body was found. The 30ft-wide copse where the body was found sits between two fields and . is 200 yards along a farm track. It is one mile from the entrance to . Sandringham House and half a mile from the Sandringham Stud where the . Queen breeds racehorses. The Royal Family are thought to have been shooting in a field of sugar beet next to the copse last week.

Critical: Holly Raper had been enjoying the adventure of a lifetime when she crashed on a dairy farm on King Island, off the coast of Tasmania . A young British woman is fighting for her life after a horrific quad bike smash during her dream trip to Australia. Photographer Holly Raper had been enjoying the adventure of a lifetime when she crashed on a dairy farm on King Island, off the coast of the state of Tasmania. The 23-year-old, from Chorley, Lancashire, had to be airlifted to hospital from the farm, where she had been working, and is now in a critical condition. Her parents Chris and Elaine flew straight out to be at her bedside on December 30, but she remains on a life support machine and doctors are continuing to run tests. A campaign to raise £25,000, called Help Holly Home, has now been launched by frantic family and friends who want to help pay for medical treatment and long-term support. In just days more than £5,000 has been pledged with the help from locals at The Cavendish Arms, in Brindle - where Holly used to work. Family friend Ann Harrison said: 'It's terrible. Holly had left in November to go travelling for a year in Australia and she was taking pictures and writing a blog as she went along. 'She had just got a job on the cattle farm and was on her way home on a quad when she crashed and had to be air-lifted to hospital. 'She is on a life support machine and her parents had initially been told she'd be lucky to survive the night, but she is putting up a real strong fight and they have flown straight out there to be with her.' Accident: Holly Raper was on Tasmania's King Island when she was involved in the quad bike crash . A description on Holly's photography website describes how she specialises in landscape and macro photography and a has keen interest in travel after a trip through South East Asia. Her friend Kevin Ormisher, who is involved in the fundraising, said: 'Holly is such a nice girl and a very talented photographer. 'She had set off travelling for 12 months and had got a job working on a farm on an island off Tazmania. 'She has suffered serious injuries and doctors had said she'd be lucky to survive the first 24 hours, but she has shown signs of movement in her fingers and pain sensations in all four limbs. 'She is really fighting for her life and we are determined to do everything we can from this end to make sure there is enough money in place to pay for long-term treatment and anything else she might need.' Fundraising events are already being planned for the next few weeks and the efforts are being co-ordinated by staff and locals at The Cavendish. Landlord Robin Tillbrook said: 'Holly loved farming, the outdoors and photography and she is a quiet, but bubbly person. She is very friendly and would do anything for anyone. 'The locals here treated her as a daughter or sister and everyone has been shocked by what has happened. 'She was living her dream in Australia and it's tragic that it's come to this. Everyone has been rallying round to do what they can and we have set up the fund as we don't know what long-term care Holly will need. 'We don't want her family to have to worry about anything else and have already raised more than £5,000 with people donating anything from £5 to £500. 'We need to keep the momentum going though as this is going to be an uphill struggle, but everyday Holly seems to be making a slight improvement which is the most important thing.""

A man died in a tragic balcony stunt just hours after arriving in Ibiza. Sam McCaughey, 23, and his friends had visited the bars and pubs after beginning their holiday at the resort of San Antonio. But Manchester Coroner’s Court heard how the night ended in tragedy when the electrical engineering student performed a daredevil balancing act on an upper floor ledge of his apartment block. Mr McCaughey, from Kirkway, . Middleton, had gone for a weekend break with three friends, landing in . the early hours of July 29 last year. They immediately headed out to sample the nightlife. David . Lancaster, 25, described how he became separated from his friends and . had returned to their apartment in the early hours just in time to see . his friend carry out the stunt. Giving evidence, he said: 'I heard someone shouting my name from across the pavement. 'It was Sam and he was jumping from balcony to balcony. He was on the fourth floor. 'I shouted at him to stop but he started balancing on it with his arms out like it was a tightrope. 'I could see what he was doing was crazy. I was screaming for him to come down. 'He was walking on his hands, putting one hand out over the other. 'It was kind of surreal. I couldn’t believe what was happening when I watched him fall.' Assistant deputy coroner Carolyn Singleton ruled that Mr McCaughey, a student at the University of Central Lancashire, in Preston, had died accidentally. Holiday: Sam and his friends had just arrived in the resort of San Antonio, Ibiza, pictured, when the tragedy happened after they had visited bars and pubs . She added: 'This was quite clearly a tragic accident. There is no other conclusion I could offer given the evidence.' Addressing his father Paul McCaughey, the coroner added: 'It is not in the natural order of things for a parent to have to deal with the death of a child. You have my sincere condolences.' A post-mortem test in the UK confirmed he died from serious multiple injuries and witness statements by Spanish police confirmed the circumstances. Mr McCaughey, who attended St Thomas More primary and Cardinal Langley secondary schools in Middleton, was the eldest of three boys, with brothers Joel, 21, and 22-year-old Jack.

Former Chancellor Alistair Darling has branded Alex Salmond 'slippery' after the Scottish First Minister claimed an independent nation would leave English taxpayers to shoulder the £187bn exposure to the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Darling reacted to the comments of Mr Salmond by saying that he was partly responsible for the bank's downfall by encouraging it to make huge errors. Speaking about Scottish National Party leader's comments, the MP said: 'It is typical of his bluster. Alex Salmond has been described as 'slippery' by Alistair Darling after he claimed responsibility for the bailout of RBS would be shouldered by English taxpayers . 'He cannot overlook the fact that he . publicly endorsed the deal by RBS that proved so disastrous. The . disaster that overtook the bank was made in Edinburgh not London.' Mr Salmond had earlier told Channel 4 News that 'the people . responsible [for RBS] ... were the London Treasury. I'm afraid people . will have to take responsibility for the past mistakes they made.' But he was later embarrassed by the publication of a letter he wrote to Sir Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former boss of RBS, that encouraged the bank to buy ABN Ambro, the deal that wrecked its finances. Nick Clegg said Mr Salmond was not being straight with Scottish voters by avoiding a debate on the big issues . Promising 'any assistance my office can provide', he signed off: 'Good luck with the bid.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Salmond was not being straight with Scottish voters by avoiding a debate on the impact upon jobs, Scotland's share of Britain's colossal deficit, the loss of defence employment and public spending. 'All of these questions have been left completely unanswered by Alex Salmond for so long, and he keeps playing cat and mouse with the people of Scotland,' said Mr Clegg. 'That creates huge uncertainty, which is bad for investment, bad for jobs, bad for the people who matter the most.' In a personal attack, he accused the media-friendly Scot of political narcissism. 'Sometimes I get the impression he thinks it's all about him. It's not, it's about the people of Scotland.' Mr Salmond earlier promised that independence would transform Scots from 'surly lodgers' to 'friendly neighbours'. And he also dismissed fresh attempts at the Scottish Parliament to force an early referendum on independence. Mr Salmond insisted he will stick to his plan and put the question to a ballot in autumn 2014. The highly-charged debate . shifted back to Edinburgh from London today following days of wrangling . between the UK and Scottish governments. Mr Salmond has already rejected Prime Minister David Cameron's offer to grant MSPs the temporary power to hold an earlier 'legal' referendum. Debate: Alex Salmond answers questions on the independence referendum at Holyrood earlier today . He also wants a specially-created body to oversee the referendum, which would be open to people as young as 16 north of the border. Speaking at the Scottish parliament, he said: 'The people of Scotland spoke in the election and their voice was very clear indeed. 'A referendum orgainsed in Scotland, . built in Scotland, for the Scottish people, discussed with civic . Scotland and then brought to the people in 2014 for a historic decision . on the future of this nation.' Newly-elected Scottish Labour leader . Johann Lamont, leading a debate on Scotland's future at Holyrood today, . suggested Mr Salmond lacks the courage to bring forward the timing of a . referendum. Accusations: Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont suggested Mr Salmond lacks the courage to bring forward the timing of a referendum during a debate at Holyrood today . She said: 'What's he frightened of? He can get any legislation he likes past this parliament. 'He has a mandate, he has a majority, . surely it cannot be he does not have the courage to face the verdict of . the Scottish people? 'He says independence will be the cure . of all Scotland's ills. The economy will be transformed by what his . spin doctors say are job-creating powers. 'His finance minister says . we'll be the sixth richest nation on earth. Scotland will be free and . proud. 'He is Moses who has led his people to . the brink of the promised land but, as they view it from the mountain . tops, says to them, 'let's camp outside for a few more years before we . go in'.' During the debate, the First Minister . cast his memory back to the late 1970s, highlighting the previous . involvement of a Westminster government in a Scottish referendum. He referred to a controversial bar . imposed on the first devolution referendum which meant 40% of the . electorate had to vote ""yes"". The limit was not achieved, even though . more people voted in favour. He also warned the Labour Party not to get too close to the Conservatives. Yesterday, Mr Cameron and Labour . leader Ed Miliband joined forces in the House of Commons in pledging to . fight for Scotland to remain part of the UK. Mr Salmond said: 'Let me warn the . Labour Party, if they go in with the Tories they'll suck you in and . they'll spit you out as they've done to the Liberal Democrats.' The exchanges were made as a new poll . conducted by YouGov for the Sun newspaper put support for independence . at 33 per cent with 53 per cent against and 14 per cent undecided.

It seems the way to New Jersey governor Chris Christie's affections really is through his stomach as he revealed to Oprah Winfrey that one of the reasons he fell for his wife Mary Pat was when she suggested they make an illicit late-night donut run. Christie talks love, weight and politics with the chat show queen for a special hour-long interview, filmed at Christie's home in Mendham, scheduled to air this Sunday at 9pm on OWN. Scroll down for video . Special guest: Oprah visited the Christie home to talk politics, weight and love with Chris and Mary Pat . Weight issues: Christie told Oprah he had learned to develop a shell about his weight and brushes off jokes by David Letterman . Asked by Winfrey what drew him to Mary Pat, whom he met at the University of Delaware in the 1980s when they were both involved in student government, he said it was her independence, her faith, and because she was fun. 'She was fun in a different way than I'd ever experienced with anybody I'd ever dated. She was very spontaneous,' Christie told Winfrey. 'Spontaneous like?' Winfrey asked. 'Let's go break into the kitchen in the dining hall at college because we smell that they are baking donuts for the next morning,' he recalled Mary Pat saying. 'So let's sneak in and steal some of the donuts now.' True romance: He revealed he fell in love with his wife at university when she suggested they break into the canteen and steal some donuts . Christie and Winfrey spoke at length about controlling their weight and managing the criticism surrounding it - specifically what it feels like to be on the short end of a Dave Letterman fat joke. 'It didn't bother you?' Winfrey asked. 'Because let me tell you, when David Letterman was making jokes about me, it bothered me.' 'I think I was girded for it, Oprah, I really do,' Christie responded, saying he had developed 'a shell about it'. The conversation also hit more serious overtones as Winfrey asked him, Mary Pat and their four children - Andrew, 18, Sarah, 15, Patrick, 11, and Bridget, 8 - about the pressure of being asked to run for president. Sarah lamented to Winfrey about being banned from having a Facebook page. 'By the way, who backed us up on you not having a Facebook account?' Christie pointed out. 'Mark Zuckerberg,' co-creator of the social networking site, Sarah answered, reluctantly. Friends: New Jersey Governor . Chris Christie (left) and Newark Mayor Cory Booker (second from right) with Oprah Winfrey and Mark Zuckerberg who told Christie's daughter NOT to open a Facebook page . Christie, Zuckerberg and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat, appeared on Winfrey's talk show in September 2010 to announce that Facebook was pledging a $100 million donation to the Newark public schools. Christie said he wanted his daughter to wait until she was a little older, given his position, so that she can better handle the 'opportunity for mischief' that Facebook provides — a position he said Zuckerberg supported. Facebook requires that members are 13 years and older but around 7.5million users in the U.S. are said to be under 13, with about five million under the age of ten. While Booker, who has been rumored as a potential candidate to run against Christie in 2013, is close to Winfrey and her best friend, Gayle King, Christie met the daytime icon for the first time at the taping of the show about Facebook's donation. Christie had been in office less than a year when he first met Winfrey. Elected in a Democratic-leaning New Jersey 2009, Christie quickly became YouTube sensation and darling of the Republican party for his blunt style, and pressure quickly mounted for him to run for the White House in 2012. He briefly considered changing his mind against running this fall, but didn't and instead endorsed Mitt Romney, whom he has been campaigning hard for ever since. Winfrey, who openly endorsed Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential elections, asked Christie what advice he had for the president and what he thought Obama's chances for re-election were. Surprisingly, Christie warned that those who underestimate Obama as a campaigner do so at their own peril. Support: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie has endorsed Mitt Romney, left, for the 2012 Presidential race but said those who underestimate Obama do so at their own peril . 'He is as good a politician as I've ever seen ... he's really good at it. And I think he's very charismatic. And I think he's genuine. I think what he says he believes he believes. That's a very dangerous politician.' But Christie was quick to say that Obama was weak in governing, and needed to work on his relationships with adversaries — something Christie has credited with helping him pass major changes to New Jersey's pension and health benefits systems. 'If he had asked me a year ago, I would have said, 'So, Mr. President, make John Boehner your best friend in the whole world. Have him over for dinner. Have him for golf regularly. Call him on the phone talk, to him, charm him, make him your pal.' So why didn't he run for the White House himself? Christie said he wasn't sure that his 'true compass' thought he was ready. 'Is that compass telling you that you may be ready four years from now?' Winfrey asked. 'Who knows? It depends on who wins. Is the president re-elected? Does a Republican win? I don't know,' Christie said. 'But in terms of me, I'll be much more ready four years from now than I am now.' First Look: Governor Chris Christie on Oprah's Next Chapter .

"By . Liz Thomas . Last updated at 1:38 AM on 14th January 2012 . It was hailed as the next big thing in cinema but it seems Britain’s 3D boom  may be over before it really even began. Film fans fed up with inflated prices and disillusioned by the lack of added  value from watching many movies in the format, opted to stick with traditional  2D showings instead. Little over a fifth of box office sales were for 3D films in 2011, compared to  27.5 per cent in 2010, according to new figures from global industry analysts  Rentrak EDI. Film fans are shunning 3D screenings and returning to the traditional format . It had been expected the 3D trend would soar after the success of James Cameron’ s epic Avatar, which made £615 million worldwide, with 90 per cent of the  audience watching in HD, and the huge popularity of Toy Story 3. But after an initial burst of interest it appears British cinema-goers don’t  feel it represents value for money for every film. The major cinema groups charge customers of 3D films up to 41 per cent more than those seeing standard films and many charge an additional £1 for the  special glasses. This means families of four face paying nearly £11 more to watch a film in 3D. ‘It is too early to say but it  seems that people are being more discerning and  making decisions on individual films, rather than simply watching everything in  3D,’ a spokesman for the BFI said. Avatar was a huge hits in the 3D format in the UK in 2010, grossing 67million . Avatar and Toy Story 3 were huge hits in the format in the UK in 2010, grossing  67million and 73.8 million respectively. By contrast the only standout 3D hit last year was the final film in the Harry  Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, which was the final film in the  franchise and grossed 73 million. The rest of the 3D top five for 2011, which included Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, grossed under £30 million. The research also showed that cinema firms, including Odeon and Cineworld, charge up to £1 per person on top of the ticket price to pay for 3D glasses. A recent YouGov poll found that almost half of Britons thought the format was 'over-hyped and just a phase.' Another reason for the slump in interest, is that 2011 saw a rise in the  popularity of character-led films in Britain such as The Kings Speech, which made £45.7 million, and Bridesmaids, which made £23 million, and these do not  need the special technology. Daily Mail film critic Chris Tookey said that consumers have also wised up to the fact that sum of the '3D films' are simply a rip off. He has said: ‘Hollywood has jumped on the 3D bandwagon and is driving it  hell-for-leather. Another 3D hit, Toy Story 3 made 73.8m in box office sales . ‘The irony is that many of the 3D movies that cinema-goers are paying over the odds for aren’t really in 3D at all.’ He pointed to Justin Bieber’s Never Say Never Again, which actually on featured  just 30 minutes of his concert in that format. An additional problem is that some people feel unwell when watching in this  format. Around 10 per cent of the UK population has poor binocular vision, which means  it is difficult for them to see 3D effects in movies and video games. Instead, they see a blurry image, and will suffer headaches, eye strain and  even nausea as a result. Experts do not recommend allowing children under eight to regularly use 3D  glasses because their eye muscles are still developing. Hugo, pictured is Martin Scorsese's first film shot in 3D . There are also question marks over whether 3D television will really take off, with some industry figures insisting that until a 'glasses-free, affordable' option is available it is unlikey to. Some electronics manufacturers have issued disclaimers to protect themselves  from legal claims warning that viewing 3D TV may cause ‘motion sickness’, ‘disorientation’ and ‘eye strain’. Last year, Sir David Attenborough warned 3D television would not take off in  Britain. The veteran, whose documentary for Sky - Flying Monsters - was made in the  format, insisted it would not become the norm for viewers because it was ‘too isolating’. Instead Sir David said consumers would opt to watch ‘big events’ in 3D such as  World Cup football matches, the forthcoming Royal Wedding, or ground-breaking new nature or history shows.","Major cinema groups charge 3D film customers up to 41 per cent more than those seeing standard films .

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 2:40 PM on 14th January 2012 . Scion: Eric Nederlander was arrested for violating a protection order when he allegedly pulled his girlfriend's hair . The most recent arrest of Broadway scion Eric Nederlander on Thursday is apparently the second time he attacked his girlfriend as more details about his allegedly aggressive past emerge. In July of last year, Nederlander allegedly slammed his girlfriend Nancy Okun's head into the Plexiglass divider of a taxi during an argument and followed her up to her Greenwich Village apartment, outside of which he proceeded to punch and shove her. Because Ms Okun, who had been dating Nederlander 'for years' at the time of the July 19 incident, decided not to prosecute, Nederlander was able to plead down to disorderly conduct and had to complete 26 weeks of anger management classes. The latest incident, however, came after a fight late Thursday night when he allegedly pulled Ms Okun's hair while she was sleeping and accused her of cheating on him. The New York Post reports he was arrested at the Greenwich Village apartment of his girlfriend Nancy Okun at 2.30am Friday morning, who prosecutors said had a limited order of protection against him. Nederlander - better known as the first Mr Jessica Seinfeld - has denied the allegations and is out on $5,000 bond. His lawyer argued that he was not a flight risk because he was a life-long New Yorker. Violation: Nederlander accused Nancy Okun (left) of cheating on him and proceeded to yank her hair agressively . The judge ordered a full order of protection, barring Nederlander from having any contact with the complainant. The . 46-year-old's marriage to Jessica Sklar - now Seinfeld - ended just . three weeks in when she met Jerry Seinfeld at the gym, just days after . returning from their honeymoon in Italy. They married on Christmas day in 1999 and are still together. Nederlander described this as a 'very difficult time' in his life. Miss Okun, 31, told police he yanked her hair while she was sleeping and said: 'You're cheating on me', after allegedly going through her cellphone. A police source told the Post that the 31-year-old felt in 'fear for her own safety'. Nederlander's lawyer Evan Lipton said there was no claim the woman was physically injured and there were 'serious issues undermining the complainant’s credibility'. The most recent incident has the 46-year-old charged with criminal contempt, a felony that carries up to four years in prison. First marriage: Nederlander was famously married to Jessica Sklar for just three weeks. She left him for comedian Jerry Seinfeld after they met at the gym . There are conflicting reports as to how Nederlander gained entry to Ms Okun's apartment, with some papers saying that the pair had been living together for weeks leading up to the incident and others saying that he got a key from her doorman. His . father Robert Nederlander is part owner of the Yankees and the family . own six theatres in new York, including the Nederlander Theatre on West . 41st Street. According to the Post, this is not the first girlfriend with whom Nederlander has had legal trouble. When he split from his second wife Lindsey Kupferman, a judge also issued her an order of protection 'based upon a finding of danger to person or property and domestic violence'. Police had been called to their home on two occasions, but Nederlander was never charged. He and Ms Kupferman divorced just seven weeks after she gave birth to their daughter. He also denied any wrongdoing at this time. Wife number two: Nederlander and his second wife Lindsey Kupferman- who looks rather similar to Ms Okun- have a daughter together named Mira and Nederlander feared the latest incident would result in custody issues .","Allegedly yanked her hair and accused her of cheating after going through cellphone .

Caught: Owen Swift, 68, has been banned from driving for nine months after police officers caught him doing 147mph on the A64 in North Yorkshire . A pensioner on his way back from a round of golf was caught speeding in his Jaguar sports car at 147mph. Owen Swift, 68, was followed by police for almost four miles before they managed to catch up with him. When he finally stopped, the company director refused to get out of his £80,000 Jaguar XKR coupe and denied he was going too fast. He disputed the speed gun readings and  criticised officers for not letting him off. ‘You can’t have got me,’ he said. ‘You were on the other side of the carriageway and crash barrier.’ He added that not being able to drive would affect his job, saying: ‘That’s it. At my age that’s my livelihood.’ When it was clear he was not going to be arrested, Swift refused a request to sign the police paperwork and drove off. Yesterday he denied speeding when he appeared at Scarborough Magistrates Court. Sergeant John Clayton and PC Ian Barrett said the Jaguar roared past their speed trap on the A64 near Malton, North Yorkshire. PC Barrett said they heard the car engine ‘working very hard.’ ‘It was quite a high-pitched noise,’ he said. The officers gave chase, with lights and sirens on, driving at more than 100 mph. When he stopped, Swift said he had spent the day playing golf and inspecting housing projects. He claimed to have been travelling at no more than 60mph. He refused to sit in the patrol car and wouldn’t sign a notice of intended prosecution. ‘We weren’t exactly seeing eye to eye,’ he told the court. ‘I was not too impressed with his attitude. 'We were reasonably civil to each other, but in the end I said “Either arrest me and get me a solicitor or let me go”. I was certainly not doing 100. I do not think the car is even capable of 147. It is limited to 155 on the speedo.’ Fast: Swift is seen getting out of a Jaguar similar to the one he was caught speeding in by officers . Swift was found guilty of speeding and fined £700 with £650 costs. He was also banned from driving for nine months. Magistrate David Harrison said: ‘In my experience of nearly 30 years on the bench, 147mph is one of the highest readings I have experienced.’ Later Sgt Clayton said: ‘This was the worst speeding offence I have ever come across. ‘My day job is a road death investigator. If something had gone wrong at that speed I might not have been dealing with Mr Swift, I might have been dealing with his family in a different capacity.’","Owen Swift argued with officers when caught in his £81,000 Jaguar .

Don't give this dog a bone: Rossi gulped down the six-inch rib before his astonished owners could stop him and had to have the spare rib surgically removed . A puppy got himself into a sticky situation when he pinched a six-inch Chinese spare rib from his owner and swallowed it in one gulp. Greedy Staffordshire bull terrier Rossi got into difficulties when the bone - which unbelievably he didn't choke on - started scratching his stomach. Owner Steven Hawthorn, 44, said the 15-week-old puppy snatched the rib and swallowed it whole as he and his family sat down to a takeaway meal. His wife Donna, 35, and sons Lewis, 13 and Samuel, 11, watched in amazement as Rossi, named after motorcycle legend Valentino Rossi, jumped up to nab the pork rib and devoured it in seconds. Worried that the bone would get stuck, Mr Hawthorn, from Oldbury, West Midlands, took Rossi to the Companion Care Veterinary Surgery the next day. An . x-ray on January 6 revealed the large bone was scratching his stomach . lining, which was starting to bleed and the pet was prepared for . surgery. Mr Hawthorn said: 'How he managed to . swallow such a large bone is amazing. How it didn't choke him or damage . his aesophagus is a miracle. Gobbled it up in one go: His owner Steven says Rossi could not resist the delicious smell of the takeaway, and ignored his usual dog food to try his luck with the takeaway . 'It could have easily ruptured his . intestines. He's lucky to be alive, a lot of things went in his favour . and we're really glad he's still here. 'A second x-ray showed the bone had moved towards the intestines. A few more hours without the operation and he would have gone, I can't praise the vets enough. 'It was our first food treat of the year after Christmas and we were looking forward to it. But as soon as he swallowed it I knew he was in trouble.' Sticky spare rib: The surgeons believe if they hadn't acted quickly Rossi could have died . Rossi usually only eats his favourite . chicken flavoured dried dog biscuits but Mr Hawthorn thinks the smell of . the ribs was too much for the puppy to resist. He . said: 'He's our first family pet and we were astonished that he would . just wolf down something like that still being so small. 'He tends not to chew things which is maybe why he tried to eat it whole rather than nibble at it. 'He didn't show any signs of any problems at first but the day we took him to the vets he was ill. 'Rossi's running around fine now though, he's made a full recovery and playing around with the family as normal.' Companion Care veterinary care . assistant Cherri Wilde said it was a very rare case that dogs of any . size swallow anything quite so large. She said: 'Poor little Rossi swallowing an entire spare rib was a most uncommon case for us. 'If he had not undergone immediate surgery then this would most likely have been fatal for the pup.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 2:23 PM on 6th January 2012 . Jamaica's new prime minister has been sworn in - and immediately vowed to ditch the Queen as her country's official Head of State. Portia Simpson Miller said she would sever colonial-era links by abandoning the British monarch and adopting a republican form of government. The Privy Council in London will also be replaced with Trinidad-based Caribbean Court of Justice as its highest court of appeal in a bid to 'end judicial surveillance from London'. Ditched: Queen Elizabeth II, pictured here (left) during her 2002 trip to Jamaica, may be removed as the country's official Head of State under plans unveiled by new Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller (right) Winner: Jamaica's new Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller, pictured here (centre) after being sworn in, has vowed to sever colonial links with Britain . Taking the oath of office, she said: 'I love the Queen; she is a beautiful lady.' But then, speaking to the audience of 10,000 in Jamaican patois, she quipped: 'But I think time come.' Jamaica declared independence from Britain in 1962 but remains within the Commonwealth and has Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State. The 66-year-old, who was sworn in yesterday for the second time, also pledged to ease Jamaica's deep poverty, boost the sputtering economy and heal its political divisions. Simpson Miller, whose one-year-long first stint in office ended in 2007, was sworn in on the grounds of the rambling, colonial-style mansion that is the official residence of the governor-general. Pop star Shaggy later performed at the event at which vuvuzelas and horns, which had been blown passionately on the night of her victory, were banned. In it together: New PM Portia Simpson Miller (right) holds hands with her predecessor Andrew Holness (left) while delivering her inaugural speech . Happy to be here: Portia Miller Simpson beams away (left) as supporters (right) held up banners . She scored a dramatic victory in last week's national elections, leading her slightly left-leaning People's National Party to a 2-to-1 margin in Parliament over the centre-right Jamaica Labour Party. Britain captured Jamaica from the Spanish, who used the island as a springboard for the conquest of the Americas, in 1655. They imported African slaves to work on the sugar plantations - and ruthlessly put down any revolts on the island. Some level of self-government was allowed, but in 1866 the Jamaican legislature renounced its powers - so the country became a crown colony. It was partially restored in the 1880s. And then in the 1930s the Great Depression had a serious impact on the emergent middle class and the working class. In 1938 sugar and dock workers around the island rose in revolt. It was suppressed but led to an organised labour movement and a competitive party system. Jamaica gained a degree of local political control in the mid-1940s and political parties were set up. The first elections under universal adult suffrage were held in 1944. Jamaica gained independence from Britain on August 6, 1962, remaining a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and with the British monarch as its official Head of State. Her opposition faction won a dominating 42 seats in the 63-seat legislature, leaving the incumbent party with 21. The plainspoken, charismatic Simpson Miller, who is the Caribbean island's first female prime minister, takes over from Andrew Holness, a 39-year-old Labour lawmaker who was leader for just over two months. In a 45-minute speech, she said: 'After being tested and tempered, I stand before you today a stronger and better person prepared to be of service to my country and people.' She vowed her government will 'ease the burdens and the pressues of increasing poverty, joblessness and deteriorating standards of living'. And she also said it would pursue a tight fiscal policy and forge strong partnerships with the private sector and international partners such as the International Monetary Fund. She added: 'My administration will work tirelessly that while we try to balance the books we balance people's lives as well.' Jamaica is a cash-strapped island with a punishing debt of roughly $18.6 billion, or 130 per cent of gross domestic product. In . the short- and medium-term, she said her administration will use 'state . resources' to stimulate jobs through the Jamaica Emergency Employment . Program, a centrepiece of her party's campaign manifesto. Successful comeback: Portia Simpson Miller pictured celebrating her election victory with supporters in Kingston, Jamaica, last week .

Her People's National Party said it will try to renegotiate roughly 25 per cent of a troubled $400 million road programme financed by China in order to transfer some of the money to the emergency employment program as a way to kickstart the economy. The prime minister also urged Jamaicans to create a more civil and respectful society and earnestly strive to make the best of themselves. She said: 'We will seek to make this country one of brothers and sisters, not of rivals and victims.' After her speech, Simpson Miller elicited laughter from the audience by dragging a slightly embarrassed-looking Holness, now the leader of the opposition, to the podium and saying she was his 'second mother'","Portia Simpson Miller sworn in after landslide election win .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 2:44 AM on 14th January 2012 . An IT worker who feared he might never have children after being paralysed from the waist down in a rugby accident is celebrating the birth of his daughter. John Power, 34, was just 18-years-old when he broke his neck during a heavy tackle whilst playing his first professional rugby match. The 6’3” sportsman, who was paralysed from the neck down, was warned he would never walk again after suffering severe damage to his spinal cord. Dream come true: John Power with his wife Julie Power and baby Ellie. He said he never thought he would have a family after he was paralysed at 18 . He spent eight months in hospital undergoing intensive physiotherapy in rehab before slowly regaining the use of his arms and body, although the prospect of ever getting married and having a family still seemed remote to him. But after meeting girlfriend Julie, 30, John was inspired to get to his feet for the first time in 15 years on their wedding day, with the aid of callipers. Now almost a year later, the delighted couple are celebrating the birth of their first child, Ellie-Beth. John, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: 'When I first had the accident I just wanted to get better. I knew that I would change my life and I would have to look to the future. 'I didn’t see myself getting married and having kids at that point, it was the last thing that was going to happen to me. But now I have ticked all the boxes and it seems like a long way away since that time. 'It was surreal watching Ellie-Beth being born. I can’t describe it. To watch her being born and then put into Julie’s arms was the best thing in the world. Then the midwife handed her to me. I stared into her eyes and stuck my tongue out at her and she did the same to me! 'I’m living the life I never thought that I would. It’s all fallen into place in the last 12 months. It’s been the best year of my life.' John had played as a fullback and centre from the age of 10 and after being signed up by professional club Oldham RLFC at the age of 18 he had hoped to form a career as a top rugby player. John Power (pictured holding his school trophy in the front row) had dreams of becoming a professional rugby player . But he was injured during his very first senior game for the new club in 1995 when a two-man tackle from behind knocked him to the ground. For two months he was unable to move any part of his body and dropped from 15st to just over 7st, relying on his family to help him eat, wash and dress. After eight months in hospital he regained control of his arms and upper body, but remained paralysed from the waist down. Determined not to give up, he spent several years focusing on intensive physiotherapy training before embarking on a MSc University Degree. He was convinced that his wheelchair would make establishing relationships with women impossible, but he met Julie eleven years ago and they married last October. Julie became pregnant not long after and baby Ellie-Beth was born at 4.13am on October 1, just two days before the couple’s first wedding anniversary, which was the date she had originally been due. Now John, who has recently set a world record after completing a charity indoor rowing marathon using only his arms, says that his life is complete and his next challenge is to be able to walk his daughter up the aisle in the future. John managed to stand on his wedding day last year to Julie . John said: 'Julie’s mum is called Elizabeth and it’s been handed down the family, so we thought Ellie-Beth would be a modern twist. She’s really playful and she’s already starting to develop a personality. 'I think she will probably grow up to be a gymnast or a dancer like her mum. She’s really long so she has the right build! 'She started smiling for the first time last week. Seeing that makes it all worth-while after coming home from work. Picking her up and cuddling her is great because she now knows who her mum and dad are. First thing in the morning when I look into the cot I can see her smiling up at me, it takes your heart away. 'I’ve got everything I could possibly ask for. There’s nothing more that we need, apart from a couple more kids in the future. 'When I first had the accident there was no chance I ever thought I would be in this position with a family and a baby. I thought that no one would see past the wheelchair, if I knew then what I know now I wouldn’t have been so afraid of it.' The proud father, who has recently started working for an E-learning company, has not given up his dream of walking one day and since his accident he has followed a strict daily physio programme to strengthen the muscles in his legs. John said: 'I am still doing my physio each day and walk using my parallel bars and callipers. 'Since standing up at our wedding I have done that more and I walk using my parallel bars. 'I’m determined to get walking even more for Ellie-Beth. Now I have a daughter I would love to be able to walk her down the aisle in the future.' New mother Julie, a Primary School teacher, said: 'Having Ellie-Beth really makes us feel complete. She’s a really happy and content baby. 'John’s always been very determined and I’m really proud of him. His positivity has always attracted me to him and now he’s now working towards walking unaided. 'Since we first met his determination has already allowed him to break a world record and stand up at our wedding. Now, he’s working towards walking down the aisle when she’s older.'","'It’s been the best year of my life'

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 5:43 PM on 11th January 2012 . A mother has told how her daughter was left unconscious after a hospital issued medicine that was incorrectly labelled. Three-year-old Ruby Plummer was diagnosed with epilepsy last March, a condition which affects the brain and causes seizures. The youngster was prescribed buccal . midazolam, a . muscle relaxant which is rubbed into the gums and used to treat prolonged attacks lasting five minutes or more. Ruby Plummer pictured with mother Helen and the mislabelled medicine bottle which caused her to take 20 times more than the correct dose of medicine . However her mother Helen, 29, claims the bottle she was . given at James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, Teesside, recommended  2.5ml doses instead of 0.25ml. And on one occasion she was told to double the measure because it had taken so long . for Ruby to recover from a seizure - meaning she gave her daughter a dose 20 times higher than the recommended amount. As a result, Ruby lost consciousness and her family feared the worst. Mrs Plummer, from Marske, Cleveland, said: 'Her lips went blue and we thought we had lost her. 'She deteriorated drastically and stopped breathing and went blue. She vomited and was choking. 'It was horrendous. She was in hospital for the whole night. The doctors didn't notice that she had been given too much. It was me that noticed. 'I'm angry and annoyed. I feel let down.' NHS guidelines suggest that children aged six months to 12 months, should be given a 0.25ml dose of buccal . midazolam, while those  aged one to four should be prescribed 0.5ml. As a precaution, each time Mrs Plummer uses the medication with her daughter she returns to hospital for a check-up. But she claims that during visits medics never questioned the dose she was administering and it was only when her daughter lost consciousness that it was clear something was wrong. She added: 'When I looked at it I thought 'that's a lot' but I thought the doctor was right. I have not been to medical school.' Since the incident Mrs Plummer who is married to John, 24, and has a son Liam, seven months, has issued a complaint. South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust confirmed they are investigating the case and have apologised to the family. A spokesperson said: 'We are very sorry for any distress and anxiety that Ruby's family have experienced. 'We take every complaint we receive . very seriously and are currently carrying out our own investigation into . this case which is ongoing and, as such, it would be inappropriate to . comment further at this stage.' According to the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) database, midazolam overdoses should not present a threat to life unless the patient has pre-existing respiratory or cardiac problems and it is combined with other central nervous system depressants. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said as it is a fairly new medication, it is regularly being monitored.","Ruby Plummer prescribed with mislabelled medicine .

The star itself is a tiny, cool red dwarf - leading Nasa to comment, 'Honey, I shrunk the planetary system.'All . three planets are thought to be rocky like Earth.

The KOI-961 star is a red dwarf with a diameter one-sixth that of our Sun, making it just 70 percent bigger than Jupiter . 'Astronomers . are just beginning to confirm the thousands of planet candidates . uncovered by Kepler so far,' said Doug Hudgins, Kepler program scientist . at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'Finding one as small as Mars is . amazing, and hints that there may be a bounty of rocky planets all . around us.' Kepler searches for planets by continuously monitoring more than 150,000 stars, looking for telltale dips in their brightness caused by crossing, or transiting, planets. Red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets . Using data from . NASA’s Kepler Mission, San Diego State University astronomers . announced the discovery of two new solar systems where planets orbit two . stars - like the fictional planet Tatooine in Star Wars (pictured). This work establishes that such 'two sun' planets . are not rare exceptions, but are in fact common with many millions existing in . our Galaxy. Both systems reside in the constellation Cygnus, with Kepler-34 at . 4,900 light-years from Earth, and Kepler-35 at 5,400 light-years, making these . among the most distant planets discovered. The latest discovery comes from a team led by astronomers at the California Institute of Technology. The team used data publicly released by the Kepler mission, along with follow-up observations from the Palomar Observatory, near San Diego, and the W.M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Their measurements dramatically revised the sizes of the planets from what was originally estimated, revealing their small nature.The three planets are very close to their star, taking less than two days to orbit around it. The KOI-961 star is a red dwarf with a diameter one-sixth that of our Sun, making it just 70 percent bigger than Jupiter.'This is the tiniest solar system found so far,' said John Johnson, the principal investigator of the research from NASA’s Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'It’s actually more similar to Jupiter and its moons in scale than any other planetary system. The discovery is further proof of the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.'Red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets.'These types of systems could be ubiquitous in the universe,' said Phil Muirhead, lead author of the new study from Caltech.

"By . Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 2:06 PM on 12th January 2012 . Jeremy Clarkson's 'tasteless' antics have sparked fury at the Indian High Commission, which has written to the BBC demanding they apologise for a Top Gear Christmas special. The controversial star caused outrage with an episode set in India in which he strips to his boxer shorts in front of his hosts and hangs offensive banners on trains. Staff at the High Commission complained that the programme was 'replete with cheap jibes, tasteless humour and lacked cultural sensitivity.' Toilet humour: The BBC admitted that 23 people complained after the Christmas special, in which the presenters attach a lavatory to their car before driving around India . 'Crass': Clarkson strips to his underwear in front of his Indian hosts . They fired off emails and letters to the show's producer, Chris Hale - copying in BBC director general Mark Thompson - expressing 'deep disappointment' at the content of Top Gear: India Special. A spokesman for the High Commission said . it had received hundreds of complaints after the special was repeated . twice over Christmas. Diplomats had consented to the programme being shot in the country after receiving a letter from Mr Hale describing it as a 'light-hearted road trip'. But the consulate complained in a letter that the content of the show was 'in breach of this agreement' and said the BBC would need to 'assuage the hurt sentiments of a huge number of people'. The incident is the latest in a string of gaffes by the badly behaved Clarkson. Just yesterday he claimed that Kent was full of immigrants from the Sangatte refugee camp in France. Embarrassing: An insulting banner attached to a train in India by the BBC team . Offensive: When the carriages split the banner's double meaning became clear . Earlier this week, he used his newspaper column to compare the Morecambe Bay tragedy in which 23 Chinese migrant workers died with synchronised swimming. Back in November, the motormouth presenter horrified public sector workers by saying strikers should be shot. Embarrassingly for Britain, David Cameron features at the start . of the Top Gear special, waving to Clarkson and telling him to 'stay away from . India'. The BBC admitted it received 23 complaints after the programme, which remains available online. It confirmed it had received a letter from the Indian High Commission and said it would respond in due course. Clarkson, 51, is one of . the BBC's highest paid stars, having earned £2.14million from his . involvement in the Top Gear last year. But the wayward star may caused serious damage to the broadcaster and its image abroad. 'We conveyed our disappointment,' said . a minister from the High Commission. 'The show was crass and . misunderstanding of Indian culture. 'Lots of people have complained to us, both Indian and British. They are deeply offended and expect us to do something. 'We don't think this is the Government's view, but we want the BBC to stop repeating this programme and take action.' Rude: The Top Gear team attached this 'Eat English muffins' banner to the side of an Indian train . Shocking: Again the carriages divided to display an obscene slogan . Bad steer: Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters James May (left) and Richard Hammond in Downing Street after filming there. David Cameron features in the special episode . The outline of the Top Gear special said the show would involve 'spontaneous interaction between the presenters and their environment'. It claimed that the key aspects would be 'beautiful scenery, busy city scenes, local charm and colour', emphasising India's 'local car culture'. Instead, Clarkson and his co-presenters drove around in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot. Showing off the car's unusual modification as he drove around the slums, Clarkson boasted: 'This is perfect for India because everyone who comes here gets the trots.' They also hung up banners that read 'British IT is good for your company' and 'Eat English muffins', which turned into offensive messages when the carriages pulled them apart. It is not the first time the show has run into trouble after venturing abroad. The BBC was forced to apologise to the Mexican ambassador last year after derogatory remarks about 'Mexican characteristics' made by Clarkson and his co-hosts. Asked whether Mr Cameron regretted his involvement in the programme, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'As you know, the BBC are able to film in Downing Street as are other broadcast companies. They were in the street and he was leaving for an event. 'The Government is not responsible for editorial decisions made by the BBC or any media organisation. This is a matter for the BBC - I don't speak for the BBC.' Asked why Mr Cameron had written a letter to the programme which was read out at its opening, the spokesman said: 'When people write to the Prime Minister, or indeed any other Government minister, it is customary to reply. He got a letter. He replied.' 21 July 2011 . From Chris Hale, Top Gear producer, to Indian High Commission, London . 'Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May will travel across India in three cars filming a light hearted road trip focusing on the journey and the inevitable idiosyncrasies of the cars they will drive, as well as the country and scenery we see along the way. 'There will be spontaneous interaction between the presenters and their environment, and potentially people they meet along the way. This will be in an incidental manner, not interviews. 'Key ingredients of what we film will be beautiful scenery, busy city scenes, local charm and colour within these locations, areas to illustrate the local car culture that exists in India.'6 January 2012 .

"By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 3:12 PM on 12th January 2012 . Taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland today announced around it will axe 3,500 jobs over the next three years so it can downsize its investment banking arm. The move at Global Banking and Markets (GBM) follows Government pressure for the 83 per cent state-owned bank to pull back from its ambitions to be a global investment player. The job losses come amid reports that . John Hourican, the head of GBM who is overseeing the . business' restructure, is in line to pick up a huge £4 million in . long-term incentive shares that he was awarded in 2009. Jobs slashed: Royal Bank of Scotland announced it will be axing 3,500 jobs as it scales back its investment banking arm . RBS said the strategy was designed to . help move toward the ring-fencing requirements outlined by the . Independent Commission on Banking and adopted by the Government last . year. The recommendation called for banks to . ring-fence their retail or high street operations from their riskier . investment banking divisions. The latest round of job cuts come on top of 2,000 losses announced by the bank last summer. The new losses will mean nearly 11,000 posts have been cut at GBM from the pre-banking crisis headcount of 24,000. GBM, which employs 18,900 worldwide and employs its workers in Stoke, Manchester, Edinburgh and London,  deals with a range of financial services such as debt advice, equity trading and mergers and acquisitions. In the money? John Hourican, who is restructuring RBS, is reportedly in line to pick £4 million from long-term shares . David Fleming, Unite national officer, slammed RBS’s decision to reduce the headcount at GBM as 'staggering'. 'It . is a disgrace that while on a daily basis stories are emerging about . the massive bonuses at the top of the bank, increasing numbers of jobs . are being cut from amongst the hard-working staff,' he said. Meanwhile, . the bank said it would restructure GBM and cash management division . Global Transaction Services (GTS), by splitting the businesses into two . new divisions - Markets and International Banking. The . changes include considering the sale or closure of its cash equities, . equity capital markets and mergers and acquisitions businesses, which . had income of around £220 million in the nine months to September and . are currently unprofitable. The . bank also said it was considering the sale of its corporate broking . arm, renowned City broker Hoare Govett, which offers independent market . advice to 100 listed companies, including 11 of the FTSE 100 index. Hoare Govett was acquired in RBS’s disastrous £48 billion joint bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007. Barclays announced plans to axe over 400 posts under 'essential changes' to its technology and infrastructure division. The bank said it would make every effort to mitigate compulsory redundancies, pointing out that the 422 job losses represented 0.74 per cent of its UK staff. David Fleming, national officer of the Unite union, said: 'The decision by Barclays Technology to cut 422 jobs is a New Year's blow for the staff. 'Unite has strongly opposed the sending of some of this work to Lithuania, when there are already highly trained workers carrying out this work. 'The vast majority of jobs will be going from Radbrooke Hall, Cheshire. There will also be jobs cut in Northampton and a scattering among other sites around the country.' Barclays denied that work was being transferred to Lithuania. GBM has suffered recently as market turbulence, driven by global recession fears, hit income - however, the division still recorded income of £1.1 billion in the three months to September 30. RBS said it aims to reduce its balance sheet from £420 billion at the end of June to around £300 billion over the three-year period. Chancellor George Osborne recently said the bank could 'go further' in its reforms and would shift its business strategy towards personal banking, small businesses and corporate banking in the UK. While the downsizing of GBM satisfies Mr Osborne’s desire for RBS to scale back riskier activities, the revelation that Mr Hourican is set to receive a hefty performance-related payout will embarrass the Prime Minister who last weekend promised a crackdown on executive pay. A binding vote for shareholders on executive salaries formed part of a proposal unveiled by David Cameron for a Government blitz on pay and bonuses in the City. Last month, a long-awaited Financial Services Authority report said RBS was brought to its knees by “multiple poor decisions” and its “gamble” on buying ABN Amro. The FSA blamed deficiencies in the management and culture at RBS prior to its £45.5 billion bailout and called for tougher rules to make bankers more accountable for their actions.","New losses will mean nearly 11,000 posts have been cut from the pre-banking crisis headcount of 24,000 .

Rivals such as LG and HTC already offer 3D handsets - using glasses-free technology to make objects 'leap out' of the screen, and armed with dual-lens 3D cameras. But the lack of games and videos that use 3D has meant that neither handset has been a huge seller. Samsung's cult Galaxy handsets are a different matter. The existence of a Galaxy S3 is an absolute certainty after the runaway success of Samsung's Galaxy S2, which sold 10 million units at last count, helping to propel Samsung's smartphone sales past Apple's in the third quarter of 2011. The new handset will launch at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona at the end of February. 'Samsung’s Galaxy lineup has been one of the most sought after smartphone lines worldwide,' says Boy Genius Report. 'The Galaxy S II became the company’s fastest selling smartphone ever, selling threemillion units in just 55 days.' 'Moreover, Samsung sold more than 30 million Galaxy S and Galaxy S II smartphones worldwide as of October. There is no question that consumers are interested in the Galaxy.' Samsung has yet to comment on the reports.","Will plug into 3D TVs to show off videos .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 12:24 PM on 13th January 2012 . Weekly jab: New injection could bring relief to millions of type 2 diabetes sufferers in Britain . A weekly diabetes jab has been approved for use on the NHS - replacing the need for twice-a-day injections for millions of diabetes sufferers. Today the UK's Health Service rationing body confirmed initial guidance given in October, that doctors can prescribe Bydureon - a slow-release form of the generic drug exenatide. In final draft guidance, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) said the £18-a-week jab could be given in . combination with certain other drugs in obese patients, or those for whom insulin injections wouldn't be . suitable. It could spell the end of sufferers having to inject themselves with exenatide twice a day. Although Primary Care Trusts were able to start issuing the drug from October, it is likely to be far more widely prescribed when NICE publishes the final guidance in February. Bydureon provides the first treatment for type 2 diabetes which can be administered just once a week. Professor Carole Longson, NICE's health technology evaluation center director, . said: '2.25 million people in the U.K. are now affected by Type 2 . diabetes, therefore it is important that there are a range of effective . treatment options, such as prolonged-release exenatide, available to . them. 'Type 2 diabetes is a serious, progressive disease; I am sure all . those affected will welcome this positive final draft recommendation.' Bydureon works in the same way as exenatide but is released much more slowly so the number . of injections needed is reduced dramatically. When blood sugar levels are high, the drug induces the pancreas to produce more insulin. This stops so much glucose being produced and released into the bloodstream. Type 2 diabetes often hits people aged over 40. The number of sufferers is expected to rise significantly in the coming years because of unhealthy diets. Gila monster: Drug replicates hormone found in the Mexican lizard . It can be treated through injections along with a healthy diet and exercise. Bydureon works by recreating a hormone found in the Gila Monster lizard which limits the amount of sugar in the blood. The reptile, found in Mexico, eats just four meals per year but digests them very slowly. An estimated 850,000 people in Britain have type 2 diabetes which has not been diagnosed. Around a quarter of people given the once a week Bydureon injections suffer from nausea as a side effect.",£18-a-week slow-release drug to be available on NHS .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:52 AM on 15th January 2012 . A failed Russian Mars probe, which became stuck in Earth's orbit after its rocket boosters failed to ignite, is expected to plunge back to Earth today somewhere in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar. The Phobos-Grunt mission, which was billed as the most exciting Russian space mission in decades, aimed to retrieve soil samples from the Martian moon Phobos. But to the embarrassment of Russian scientists the spacecraft, which has been described as a flying fuel tank, became stuck after an initially successful launch on November 8. Doomed: The Phobos-Grunt probe blasts off successfully in November last year. It is expected to come crashing back to earth on Sunday after its booster rockets failed to ignite and send it on its way to Mars . Since then it has slowly been losing altitude due to gravity's pull. Worryingly the 14-ton spacecraft still has an estimated 11 tons of highly toxic rocket fuel on board, namely DiMethylHydrazine and Dinitrogen TetrOxide. Mission controllers remain confident . that most of the craft will disintegrate as it re-enters the earth's . atmosphere and the fuel is housed inside aluminum tanks which have a . relatively low melting temperature. Re-entry: The probe burns red hot as it approaches earth's atmosphere in this image captured by the German Tracking and Imaging Radar facility . Igor Lissov, an . independent Moscow-based space observer, said: 'The fuel indeed poses lethal danger . in case of close contact, but I haven’t heard of a single case of any . civilians poisoned by rocket fuel from all the derelict satellites and . failed rockets throughout the space era. 'The objective reality is that it burns on re-entry. There is no reason to panic.' Some experts believe that the fuel could have frozen and therefore survive the fiery descent, posing a strong threat if it spills over populated areas. Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said that the probability is low that a large lump of toxic fuel will prove hazardous. He noted that some of the probe’s . equipment is dense and could survive re-entry, but added the odds are . that any surviving pieces will end up in the ocean. He said: 'All the best rules in the world put . in place to prevent uncontrolled satellites from crashing down do . little if any good in the event of a launch failure. 'This is always going to be the risk that something breaks, and you end . up with a situation like this. You can minimize it, but you can’t . prevent it entirely.' Due to constant changes in Earth's upper atmosphere, which is strongly influenced by solar activity, the exact time and place of the satellite's return has been difficult to predict. Predictions on Friday had the satellite re-entering over the Atlantic Ocean, east of Argentina, around 3:22 p.m. EST. Now, it appears the probe will plummet back to Earth today somewhere in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar. 'The technology is such that there is no way we can control or predict where Phobos-Grunt will come down,' said Michael Simpson, executive director of the Colorado-based Secure World Foundation. 'With 73 percent of the planet . covered in water, odds are this thing is going to splash down rather . than hit land,' he said. 'The chance that this is going to be a threat . to anyone is extremely remote, but people are concerned.' Flying fuel tank: The failed probe still has 11 tons of highly-toxic fuel on board . They  predict that only between . 20 and 30 fragments of the Phobos probe with a total weight of up to . 200 kilograms will survive the re-entry. In . 2008, the U.S. Navy shot down a stranded U.S. spy satellite reportedly . to cut the contamination risk of 100 pounds (45 kg) of rocket fuel. That . satellite's tank, however, was believed to have been made of metal . alloys more resistant to heating than aluminum, Simpson said. Crashdown: A Handout image released by the Russian Federal Space Agency Roscosmos maps the huge area where controllers say the Phobos-Grunt will fall . One . component of Phobos-Grunt that likely will survive re-entry is a small . return capsule specifically designed to make a crash landing back to . Earth in 2014. Phobus-Grunt's . return to Earth is being monitored by dozens of organizations, . including the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordinating Committee, an . offshoot of the United Nations' Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer . Space. The panel includes representatives from 12 space agencies, . including NASA, Russia and China. Botched: The ambitious mission was meant to re-install pride in the Russian space agency . The . spacecraft is the third large satellite to return to Earth since . September, when NASA's defunct Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite fell . out of orbit, showering debris into the Pacific Ocean. Germany's Rosat . X-ray telescope re-entered a month later over the Bay of Bengal. The $170-million Phobos-Ground mission was Russia’s most expensive and the most ambitious space endeavor since Soviet times. Destination Mars: The Phobos-Grunt probe being prepared for launch in November this year . The spacecraft was intended to land on the crater-dented, potato-shaped Martian moon, collect soil samples and fly them back to Earth, giving scientists precious materials that could shed more light on the genesis of the solar system. The probe was successfully launched on November 9 and entered a preliminary orbit where its engines were supposed to fire to set it on its path to Mars. They never did, and attempts to fix the glitch by Russian and European Space Agency experts failed. Russia’s space chief has acknowledged the Phobos-Ground mission was ill-prepared and risks of its failure were high, but said that Roscosmos had to give it the go-ahead so as not to miss the limited Earth-to-Mars launch window. Phobos-Ground marked Russia’s first planned foray beyond Earth’s orbit since a botched 1996 robotic mission to Mars. That probe, designed by the same Lavochkin company, crashed shortly after launch due to an engine failure. The firm also built two other Phobos-bound probes that failed in 1988. The crash of Mars-96 generated strong international fears because of some 200 grams of plutonium onboard. The craft eventually showered its fragments over the Chile-Bolivia border in the Andes Mountains, and the pieces were never recovered. Phobos is the larger and closer of the two moons of Mars, the other being Deimos. Both moons were discovered in 1877, Phobos named after the Greek god Phobos, a son of Ares (Mars). A small, irregular-shaped object, Phobos orbits Mars closer than any other known moon orbits its planet. It orbits so close to the planet that . it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates. As a result, from . the surface of the planet, Phobos would rise in the west, move rapidly . across the sky (in a little over four hours) and set in the east. Indeed, its orbit is decaying and will eventually smash into the surface of Mars or break up into a Saturn-like planetary ring. Phobos is one of the least-reflective bodies in the solar system, and features a large impact crater, Stickney crater. Phobos has been photographed in close-up by several spacecraft, whose primary mission has been to photograph Mars. The . first was Mariner 9 in 1971, followed by Viking 1 in 1977, Mars Global . Surveyor in 1998 and 2003, Mars Express in 2004, 2008, and 2010, and . Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2007 and 2008.","Fourteen ton spacecraft still has 11 tons of toxic rocket fuel on board .

Nintendo's Brain Training and Brain Age games sold 19 million units and became one of the biggest hits on DS - but their supposed health benefits have always been disputed. Now a study of elderly volunteers has found that Brain Age seems to speed up brain function - when compared to a control group who played Tetris five days a week for a month. Nintendo's Brain Age games sold 19 million units on the basis of health claims - new research hints that they DO speed up your brain, but not all of its functions . The thirty two volunteers were recruited via advertisements in local newspapers in Japan. They were split into two groups, one of which played Tetris for 15 minutes a day, five days a week for four weeks. The other group played Brain Age for the same period. Measures of cognitive functions were taken before and after the training. There was a slight increase in speed and certain cognitive functions in the group that had played brain age - although there was no increase in important brain functions such as attention span. It's also uncertain, say the researchers, whether the games have any long-term effect - and they admit they need to repeat the results with a larger group. 'This result indicated that there is a possibility which the elderly could improve executive functions and processing speed in short term training,' says the paper, published in the journal PLoS One. 'The results need replication in large samples. Long-term effects and relevance for every-day functioning remain uncertain as yet.' The disclaimer for the article says that Dr Ryuta Kawashima - the neuroscientist who created the games - was involved in the research, but that none of the other scientists at Tohoku University had competing interests. The publication in a reputable scientific journal also hints that the research is credible,.","Games speed up brain function after a month .

"The judge made the award to show ‘the courts and society’s . disapproval of the racial slurs’. By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 4:07 PM on 13th January 2012 . Don Lorenzo has been awarded damages for the physical and racial abuse he suffered at the hands of police . A former roadie for The Clash who was called a ‘f****** n***er’ as he was viciously assaulted by a group of policemen has won more than a year’s wages in damages. The judge said he made the award to Don Lorenzo, a Rastafarian, to show ‘the courts and society’s disapproval of the racial slurs’. Mr Lorenzo , 58, suffered cuts and bruises to his entire body in a 23-hour ordeal that happened outside his home and even in a police station after he was arrested for a crime he didn’t commit. The incident in 2007, in which up to 19 officers were involved, left him with carpel tunnel syndrome in his wrists which ended his career as an African drummer. Now in his case against West Midlands police a jury found in his favour following a six-day trial at Birmingham County Court. The judge, Recorder Adrian Jack, awarded the former freelance drummer - a roadie for rock legends The Clash, who sang the hit I Fought The Law And The Law Won  - damages totalling £17,000 - including £5,000 in aggravated damage. He also awarded Mr Lorenzo 100 per cent of his costs estimated in the region of £50,000 against the Chief Constable of the West Midlands. Mr Jack also pointed out that Mr Lorenzo’s ‘extreme distress’ was ‘excacerbated by the racial abuse received on arrest’. After the award his solicitor Nick Turner said: ‘I’ve dealt with some cases of assault by police in my time, but this is tinged with terrible racism and leaves an awful taste in the mouth. ‘An innocent father was dealt with in a deplorable way and that was partly to do with the colour of his skin. ‘The case against the police was black and white and the jury rightly found in Mr Lorenzo’s favour.’ On November 20, 2007, Mr Lorenzo’s teenage daughter called the police falsely alleging he’d hit her when he arrived home in Edgbaston, Birmingham, accompanied by the caretaker for his block of flats. His daughter Kaya, now 20, had no marks on her and Don thought the police would tell her off for wasting their time. But . instead began a 23-hour ordeal with him being racially abused and . assaulted numerous times by police officers, the court was told. Bruised: Mr Lorenzo was put through a 23-hour ordeal after officers were called to his house by his daughter . Mr Lorenzo with his daughter Kaya, 20. He expected the police to tell her off for wasting their time as they responded to her report of an incident that never happened . He was punched in the mouth several times, kicked and dragged down five flights of stairs from his fifth storey home and then when taken to Bournville Lane Police Station - where he was assaulted again, the court heard. After his victory in court Don said: ‘All along I realised what was going on and that my action was against all the odds. ‘I am a realist and I knew that there was just me saying that 19 police officers were wrong. ‘I was acquitted in the criminal courts and this case was no different. The police officers have been shown to be racist. ‘They were shown to have called me a f***ing n***er when I was on the floor outside my home. ‘They continually racially abused me as they dragged me down the stairs. But justice has now been done with the jury finding in my favour and the judge awarding substantial damages.’ Mr Turner added: ‘The costs for bringing this claim are expected to be in the region of £50,000 on each side - that’s a bill of £100,000 for the British taxpayer. ‘There should be no place in society for racists, to find them in the police force is absolutely sickening. ‘Whilst . the Metropolitan Police appear to be learning the lessons of the . Macpherson Report they are clearly very hard of hearing in the West . Midlands. ‘This was a . very highly violent, racist assault by officers of the West Midlands . force on a UK citizen with Afro-Caribbean heritage and it was compounded . by his false imprisonment for more than 23 hours. ‘It . is astonishing that the police have never once apologised for their . actions - particularly with the damages being fixed so close to the . conviction of Gary Dobson and David Norris for the murder of Stephen . Lawrence when abhorrent racism is so prominent on our agenda as a . society.’ West Midlands Police requested leave to appeal. The force could not be reached for comment.

A GP accused of telling a patient he was an 'a*******' destined for a 'horrible death' will battle to save his practice before a tribunal next month. Dr Richard Dunn faces allegations that his 'rude and abrupt manner' left patients feeling bullied and intimidated and, instead of simply telling tobacco addicts their options, he informed them they would die horribly if they didn't quit. However the GP, who practices in West Kent, disputes the accusations and says that, even if he did use the word 'a*******', it was not a description of his patient but was meant as 'a basic description of a part of his anatomy'. A file picture of an unknown GP talking to a patient. Dr Richard Dunn faces claims that his 'rude and abrupt manner' left patients feeling bullied and intimidated . After a series of patient complaints about Dr Dunn's manner, West Kent Primary Care Trust is now trying to have him removed from its 'Performers' List' and the case is set to be heard by the First Tier Tribunal in February. In a preliminary decision last month, tribunal judge, Melanie Lewis, said Dr Dunn stands accused of having a 'grossly unprofessional and unacceptable manner towards patients' as well as poor record keeping and failing to provide 'clinically appropriate' treatment in some cases. The Primary Care Trust (PCT) launched an investigation after a 'significant number' of patients requesting a transfer from Dr Dunn's practice raised concerns about his conduct and the treatment he was providing. Detailing some of the 'highlights' of the claims Dr Dunn faces, Judge Lewis added: 'A number of patients complained of no eye contact and/or rude and abrupt manner. Patients complained of Dr Dunn being bullying and intimidating when they felt too ill to defend themselves. West Kent Primary Care Trust is trying to have Dr Dunn removed from its 'Performers' List' and the case is set to be heard by the First Tier Tribunal . 'There is also a specific example of Dr Dunn allegedly telling a patient that he was an 'a******' and was going to die a 'horrible death' and was a 'burden on him'. 'In relation to that particular allegation, which he (Dr Dunn) does not accept, he says that whilst he may have used that word, it was not a description of the patient but a basic description of a part of his anatomy'. Another patient who complained of 'foul language', claimed Dr Dunn had told him: 'Now get out of my office, you're p****** me off and no doubt you p*** other people off as well'. Judge Lewis added: 'We read other examples of where Dr Dunn hadn't simply given patients an explanation of the choices available to them if they continued to for example smoke, but allegedly told them that they would die a horrible death.' Dr Dunn was temporarily suspended from the PCT's Performers' List in October 2010, but Judge Lewis refused to extend that and he has been back on the list, subject to an agreed regime of 'strict and intensive monitoring and supervision', since the December ruling. In her decision, Judge Lewis said 'no adverse professional findings' had ever been made against Dr Dunn, who qualified in 1986 and is now in his mid-50s. The judge made no findings on any of the allegations faced by Dr Dunn, none of which have been proved, and observed: 'Overall, our view is that whilst troubling, conduct and negative language to patients, are issues that are capable of being remedied.' Despite claims that Dr Dunn's treatment of some patients was not 'clinically appropriate', she said it was 'not a case of glaring error or omission'. And restoring his name to the Performers' List pending the full hearing of his case, Judge Lewis concluded the continued suspension of an experienced GP was neither necessary to protect the public nor otherwise in the public interest. Dr Dunn's case has now been listed for a full hearing, expected to last at least five days, before the First Tier Tribunal in February.",Dr Richard Dunn said if he did use the word 'a******* it was meant as a 'basic description of a part of his anatomy'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:56 PM on 12th January 2012 . John Terry has remortgaged his mansion for a fourth time, taking his home loan to a staggering £4.65million, it has been reported. The huge sum is more than twice the £170,000-a-week Chelsea captain paid for the house, The Sun reports. He bought the property in Oxshott, Surrey, for £2.25million in July 2003, according to publicly available records. Land Registry records seen by the Sun show the England captain carried out the most recent remortgaging deal last June. John Terry and his wife Toni have tried unsuccessfully to sell their home . He remortgaged with Northern Rock 12 months after first buying the house, then with Queen's banker Coutts - through whom he bought the house - in March 2006 and yet again in 2009, Land Registry figures show. At the time his agent insisted that the footballer, who has repeatedly denied having a gambling problem, was simply taking advantage of a generous rate of interest to fund other property deals. The value of Terry's property will have risen since he first bought it, but he still has an incredibly large mortgage for someone earning more than half a million pounds a month. A source told The Sun: 'It is very unusual behaviour for someone earning significantly more than half a million pounds a month.' Based on current premium account rates, the monthly repayments on Terry's own home loan are likely to be about £13,500. His mother-in- law's property would add around £4,700. Terry bought his Surrey mansion in 2003 for £2.25million . The Chelsea captain's season has been dogged by controversy . His agent said Terry, facing race charges after an incident involving QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, had a 'vast property portfolio in the UK and around the world'. Terry is due to appear at West London . magistrates' court on February 1 to be charged with a racially . aggravated public order offence, accusing him of causing someone . ‘harassment, alarm or distress’ under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The charge relates to a penalty box clash with Ferdinand at QPR's Loftus Road stadium in October in which he is accused of calling Ferdinand a ‘f****** black ****’. Terry, who denies any racial abuse, said after the match that he told Ferdinand, whose brother Rio plays alongside him for England, that the remarks had been taken out of context, insisting he actually said: ‘Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a  black ****?’ However, prosecutors decided there was enough evidence, . including TV images of the incident that were beamed around the world, . to charge him. The Sun also reported that Terry remortgaged his mother-in-law's home in a move apparently to generate cash to build a vast luxury estate from scratch. He bought Sue Poole her mansion next door to his own for a reported £3.15million in August 2007, but remortgaged on June 7 last year - the same day he remortgaged his place for the fourth time, The Sun reports. Months earlier he had won planning permission to turn the site into a ten-bedroom super mansion. Work began six months ago and is due for completion in December. Terry aims to move there with wife Toni and their five-year-old twins Georgie John and Summer Rose. At one point he had tried to free up some capital by selling it for a huge profit. First he asked £5million in 2010. He then cut the price by £250,000 and - when it still didn't shift - by another £500,000 to £4.25million. During this time he also tried to sell his own mansion for £6.5million, but had no offers had that price.",Chelsea captain due in court next month to face race charge over Ferdinand clash .

He said: 'Nothing could top this in my life, this is just amazing. It’s the best experience ever. 'Definitely I’ve found a reconnection with him, it’s just incredible. The perfect closure for my search.' ‘Seasons In the Sun’ by Canadian singer Terry Jacks remains one of the best known pop songs of all time, and became a Christmas Number 1 in 1999 for Westlife. Close: Alan Ludley is pictured here with his son Adrian shortly before the musician was killed in a car crash . It was an adaptation of the song ‘Le Moribond’ by Belgium songwriter Jacques Brel in 1961 with lyrics by American singer-poet Rod McKuen. The Jacks version is one of the fewer than thirty all-time singles to have sold 10 million (or more) copies worldwide. But years before Jacks shot to fame, a newly-signed band in Middlesbrough called Rivers Invitation had recorded their version of the song for Polydor and it was all set for a 1970 summer release when tragedy struck. Alan, who was the band's singer, was killed aged 23 in a car crash, Rivers Invitation disbanded with their debut single unreleased. It left his baby Adrian to be raised by his grandparents, before moving on to start adult life in California. As he approached his 40’s with children of his own, Adrian became determined to find out more about the father he could not remember. Popular: When Alan Ludley was killed in a car crash, his version of Seasons in the Sun was never released - so singer Terry Jacks, pictured, recorded it instead . He embarked on a quest to find a . recording of the Rivers Invitation version of Seasons in the Sun and to . hear his dad sing the words which had become loaded with added poignancy . because of his sudden death - ‘goodbye to you my trusted friend. Goodbye my friend it’s hard to die’. Four years ago Adrian contacted BBC Tees presenter John Foster for help and an appeal to listeners did help to find some recordings and photographs, but not Seasons In The Sun. Adrian told listeners at the time: 'The song that I’ve been searching for and what everyone has told me was the recording of Seasons in the Sun. 'It would be absolutely amazing if that ever came about - huge. I’d never experienced any of his music. 'Since the accident, since I was a kid I would search but nothing ever came of it so I could only really imagine what his voice must have sounded like. 'The first time I was told he recorded Seasons In The Sun I didn’t believe it. Great find: BBC Tees presenter John Foster, right, with the old original recording of Seasons in the Sun which was found in the house of Peter Ayton, left . 'It was too much because of the magnitude of that song and how everybody knew it. 'It was the first 45 record I ever bought and I would listen to it in . my bedroom over and over and imagine how he would sing it. 'It would be amazing to actually get that song because that’s what triggered it all, that’s what motivated me.' After four years of trying, Adrian feared the song had been lost forever, but it was then discovered in an old tin of junk in band member Peter Ayton’s house. The song was played to Adrian and Inside Out got the band members back together for the film. And after hearing the emotional recording together, Adrian broke down in tears and uttered: 'Thank you all so much.'Adrian's story is told on Inside Out BBC One (NE & Cumbria) on Monday  January 16 at 7.30pm and can be seen the following day by viewers outside the North East & Cumbria on the BBC iPlayer.","Alan Ludley was tipped for fame when he laid down Polydor track .

A nuclear-powered, car-sized spacecraft hurtling toward Mars is preparing to fire its thrusters and put itself on course for an August landing. The one-ton rover, named Curiosity, has been cruising along since rocketing from Earth last November. The engine firing is the most important task Curiosity will perform during its 352-million-mile flight to the red planet. The one-ton rover, named Curiosity, has been cruising along since rocketing from Earth last November, and is due to fire its engines to steer towards Mars. It's the crucial moment of its 352-million-mile flight to the red planet . Previous robotic explorers have had to adjust their paths several times en route to ensure a bull's-eye landing. 'Just because this is a well-travelled road to Mars given the number of trips we've made, I'm very careful to not let that experience cause us to be complacent,' said Arthur Amador of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the £1.6 billion mission. Curiosity has already travelled 80 million miles and will be travelling at 10,200 mph relative to the Earth. The team uploaded commands calling for the spacecraft to fire its eight thrusters for nearly three hours, redirecting it closer to its target. The one-ton Curiosity rover - Curiosity has already travelled 80 million miles and will be travelling at 10,200 mph relative to the Earth . Though it will execute the move without human interference, engineers will be on standby in the off chance that they have to abort. 'We should be very, very close to our desired aim point at the top of the Martian atmosphere,' after the manoeuvre, said Amador. If Curiosity did not tweak its position, it would have missed Mars altogether. Engineers did this by design to prevent the rocket's upper stage from hitting Mars - instead, it will sail into space. Once Curiosity separated from the upper stage and was on its way, the team has several chances to fine-tune its trajectory before touchdown. Curiosity, whose formal name is the Mars Science Laboratory, is aiming for a 96-mile-wide crater near the Martian equator that boasts a towering mountain in the centre. The six-wheel, nuclear-powered rover planned to drive to the lower flanks and examine the layered deposits to determine whether the area once had conditions capable of supporting microbial life. Armed with a suite of instruments including a laser to zap into bedrock and a jackhammer, Curiosity is more sophisticated than previous Mars surface spacecraft. Despite its capabilities, it won't be able to detect life. Instead, it will hunt for the chemical building blocks of life during its two-year mission.","£1.6 billion machine will fire thrusters for three hours .

"By . David Wilkes . Last updated at 5:01 PM on 14th January 2012 . In court: Geoffrey Butler, 54, is accused of racially harassing a German man and his wife . A teacher put his German neighbour through four years of ‘hell’ by blaring out the Dambusters theme, Vera Lynn singing White Cliffs of Dover and Rule Britannia, a court heard. Geoffrey Butler, 54, is accused of  racially harassing the man and his wife by playing wartime classics, including  the Colonel Bogey March from the film Bridge On the River Kwai, doing a Nazi salute and broadcasting a Winston Churchill speech. He is also accused of whistling patriotic tunes, staring at his neighbours and making unfounded complaints about them. Butler, a maths teacher for 28 years, denies the four-year hate campaign. Medway magistrates in Kent heard that Reinhard Wendt, 62, and his wife Kathryn moved next door to Butler in the village of Lower Upnor in 2007. At first the neighbours got on well, but before long they fell out over a tiny piece of land no more than six feet long which was to be transferred to the Wendts. Mr Butler accused the Wendts of being dishonest and complained the failed deal cost him £256 in solicitors’ fees. The row quickly escalated, the court heard. Dispute: Neighbours Kathyrn and Reinhard Wendt, who is German, outside Medway Magistrates Court . Butler, whose family  members served in the RAF including one in the 617  ‘Dambusters’ squadron, was questioned on suspicion of assault after an incident between him and Mr Wendt  in July 2007, but no charges were brought. Butler was arrested last May and charged with racially-aggravated harassment. The court heard he told police: ‘I haven’t been doing this. It may happen on the odd occasion, whatever. I don’t see anything wrong with Dame Vera Lynn. I come from an RAF family.’ But Mr Wendt, who moved to Britain from Germany in 1999, accused Butler of whistling the war tunes and playing them from his car stereo regularly since 2007. He also claimed Butler would pretend to be on his phone next to the garden fence and talk loudly about Nazis. Reinhard Wendt and his wife Kathryn live on the left opposite Mr Butler. The couple moved to the village of Lower Upnor in Kent in 2007 . He told magistrates he had nightmares and said: ‘It was like waterboarding, after a while a little whistle was enough. It let me know he was there and watching me.’ Social worker Mrs Wendt, who broke down in tears  giving evidence, said: ‘It made me feel nervous and intimidated and I didn’t want to  go out into my back garden. 'I just want to live a peaceful life. I haven’t looked for this trouble.’ The court was told that Butler would stand on his garage roof and his ladder to stare at the Wendts, but Butler said he was sunbathing. Events came to a head last April when the Wendts claimed they were sitting in bed and saw Butler taking a picture of them through the window, which Butler denied. That afternoon Mr Wendt made a recording on his  phone, apparently of Butler playing one of Churchill’s  war speeches. Five days later the Wendts claimed they saw Butler in his kitchen making a Nazi salute, mimicking a Hitler moustache with his fingers and shouting. Butler told police Mr Wendt was the one giving him the salute, adding: ‘Why would I do that? I find it grossly offensive.’ If found guilty he could face up to two years’ jail. The case was adjourned. A court heard Mr Butler blared out the themes to Dambusters, Dad's Army (pictured) and Rule Britannia .","Geoffrey Butler allegedly did a Nazi salute and broadcast one of Winston Churchill's speeches .

"Widow forced to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her own . husband in attempt to revive him . Launches complaint against paramedics . By . David Gerges . Last updated at 10:01 AM on 16th January 2012 . A grieving widow has told of her horror after ambulance staff threw her out of the vehicle transporting her dying husband to hospital after he was involved in a skiing accident. Dana Morse, from Kingston, Canada, was holidaying in the popular Sugarloaf ski resort in Maine, in the northeastern region of the U.S., when her spouse David lost control before crashing into a tree. Mrs Morse had initially sat in the front of the ambulance as it drove to the hospital, but after pleading with staff to sit in the back alongside Mr Morse, she was stunned when the driver pulled over and let her out. Tragic: David Morse, an experienced skier,died after crashing into a tree at Sugarloaf Ski Resort Maine . Mrs Morse said: 'He left me on the side of the road in a snowstorm, with me then chasing the ambulance screaming my head off to stop. 'Here I am, looking like a freaking lunatic, pulling cars over to ask them to help me.' Mrs Morse, a nurse practitioner, complained that paramedics overlooked her husband's internal bleeding, multiple chest injuries and abdominal pain following his collision that eventually saw him suffer respiratory arrest. She intervened, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her own . husband, before staff eventually started an IV drip. Then as they drove to the emergency department, Mrs Morse was thrown out after requesting to sit by her husband. She added: '(I said) he is dying and I know he is dying and cannot live with myself if I am not holding his hand. I can’t explain to my boys — they are 11 and 14 — I cannot explain to them that I wasn’t with their father when he died.' Fatal: Mr Morse suffered multiple chest injuries and internal bleeding . Mr Morse, 41, an experienced skier is believed to have died in the ambulance on route to the hospital. However, an official at Franklin Memorial has denied Mrs Morse's claims, insisting no complaint has been lodged by the widow. Ralph Johnson, chief information officer noted that an investigation had been launched into the conduct of NorthStar Ambulance staff. Yet he added that ambulance director David Robie, was also unaware of the allegations made against his paramedics. The Morse family had been on a vacation at the resort for a week prior to Mr Morse's fatal crash.","Widow forced to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her own .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 8:53 AM on 16th January 2012 . British explorers are preparing to drill through almost two miles of ice into an Antarctic lake as they seek clues about life one million years ago. The team used a 'tractor train' to tow nearly 70 tonnes of equipment to the Lake Ellsworth drilling site which is one of the most hostile environments on earth as they prepare for the operation. They will return in November to collect water and sediment from the buried lake using space industry standard 'clean technology'. British team: The UK flag flies at lake Ellsworth where the drilling will take place later this year. 70 tonnes of equipment has since been moved into place ready for the operation . They hope the samples will provide clues about the Earth's past climate. It could also help scientists assess the present-day stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and implications for future rises in the sea level. The advance party, comprising four . British engineers, braved temperatures of -35C as . they transported the drilling equipment. They used powerful tractors to tow heavy containers of equipment on sledges and skis across deep snow and through steep mountain passes. Explorers: The team of four who are braving freezing conditions to work at the Lake Ellsworth site . Final frontier: The British team will live in tents at the site as they collect samples from 1.8miles below the ice . The 155-mile journey through the Ellsworth Mountain Range took them three days to complete. Scientists have been planning the investigation for more than 15 years. The Lake Ellsworth Programme Principal Investigator, Professor Martin Siegert from the University of Edinburgh, said: 'The completion of this stage of the mission is a welcome one - we are now one step closer to finding out if new and unique forms of microbial life could have evolved in this environment. 'The samples we hope to capture from Lake Ellsworth will be hugely valuable to the scientific community. 'This year we will complete and test both the water sampling probe and the sediment corer. Frozen wastes: Lake Ellsworth, where the drilling is being carried out, is in the West of Antarctica. There are more than 400 subglacial lakes across Antarctica . 'Extracted sediment samples could give us an important insight in to the ancient history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, including past collapse, which would have implications for future sea level rise.' During phase two of the project researchers will use a high-pressure drill to create a borehole through 1.8miles of ice. They will then lower a titanium probe to measure and sample the water, followed by a corer to extract sediment from the lake. It will take around three days to drill through the ice and the scientists will have about 24 hours to gather samples before the hole starts to freeze over. Plan: This graph shows how the team will create a 1.8mile borehole to the bottom of the lake over three days before lowering a corer to extract sediment . The equipment has been left one mile from the actual drilling site so that the location remains unaffected by the equipment's presence. Lake Ellsworth is around 8.6 miles long, 1.2-1.8 miles wide and 150m deep, around the size of Loch Katrine in the Trossachs, or Lake Windermere in the Lake District. Chris Hill, Advance Party Member and Lake Ellsworth Programme Manager said: 'This is a major milestone for the programme and we are delighted that our complex logistical operations were a success this season. 'Working within the short Antarctic summer season adds pressure to our time on the continent, which is why we had to plan two stages of the programme.' The Lake Ellsworth programme is a consortium, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), between British Antarctic Survey and the National Oceanography Centre - and the UK university sector. More than 400 subglacial lakes have so far been discovered beneath Antarctica's vast ice sheet. A Russian team hopes soon to penetrate and collect samples from Lake Vostok in East Antarctica.","Team faced -35C temperatures as they moved 70 tonnes of equipment to drilling site through mountain range .

An advert aimed at discrediting an anti-corruption campaigner against Prime Minister Vladimir Putin compares him to Hitler. Alexei Navalny is one of the key figures leading protests and activism to challenge the results of Russia's December 4 parliamentary elections. Now an advert which matches some of his gestures while speaking at demonstrations to archival footage of Hitler was posted on a Russian blog dedicated to mocking Putin's opponents. Mr Navalny is regarded as the only opposition figure to have emerged in Russia in the last five years and gained political prominence when he started blogging four years ago. He is arguably the only major opposition figure to emerge in Russia in the past five years and owes his political prominence almost exclusively to a blog he started in 2008. Scroll down for video . The advert, matches of Navalny's gestures, pictured left to Hitler pictured right . A video of the advert was uploaded to . YouTube on Wednesday but it was not until Mr Navalny drew attention to . it himself on his Twitter account the next day that it gained popularity. It has now been viewed more than . 343,000 times. It is yet . another attempt to caricature the campaigner who has also featured in . cartoons as a fascist while raising his arm in a Nazi salute for his . pro-nationalist politics. Navalny's early blogs were about about allegations of malpractice and corruption at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations, such as energy giants Gazprom, Rosneft and Transneft, and VTB bank. The video is one of many attempts to caricature the campaigner who has also featured in cartoons as a fascist . Navalny is regarded as the only major opposition figure to emerge in Russia in the past five years . Previously, he had been a relatively minor figure involved in various opposition groups. He was also involved in nationalist . politics and has taken part in a number of the annual nationalist shows . of strength, known as the Russian Marches. In December 2008, his blog had just over 1,500 regular readers. By May 2010, it had over 11,000 and currently it has over 60,000 with 117,000 followers on Twitter. Campaigner: Alexei Navalny owes much of his political prominence to blogging . The popularity of his blog enabled him to encourage internet users to join his anti-corruption campaigns by means of what he called his 'unstoppable mass complaints machine.' The 'machine' worked by getting people to send hundreds of online complaints to investigative bodies demanding that they look into the case that Mr Navalny was pursuing at the time. Last year he launched the website Rospil.info to expose and investigate corruption in the awarding of government contracts.","Advert matches gestures of Alexei Navalny to those of Nazi Hitler .

A gay senior clergyman who claims he was blocked from becoming a bishop has threatened to take the Church of England to court. Church sources say the Very Rev Jeffrey John, Dean of St Albans, believes he could sue officials under the Equality Act 2010, which bans discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. He has instructed a leading employment lawyer after being rejected for the role of Bishop of Southwark in 2010. The dean is one of the most contentious figures in the church. In 2003 he was forced to step down as Bishop of Reading by Archbishop of . Canterbury Rowan Williams after it became known that he was in a gay, . though celibate, relationship. The furore fuelled a bitter civil war . within the Anglican Church that has dominated Dr Williams’s decade in . office. The dean was again a . cause of infighting in 2010 when he was a candidate for Bishop of . Southwark. A respected theologian and former canon at Southwark . Cathedral, he had strong backing from senior Church liberals and it was . said even David Cameron was supportive. But . the Crown Nominations Commission, whose members are responsible for . selecting bishops and include Dr Williams, appointed another candidate. Challenge: Gay dean Dr Jeffrey John has said he will take action against the Church . Dr John was said to be furious and his supporters’ anger was stoked by a . memo by another member of the commission, the late Dean of Southwark . Colin Slee, claiming Dr Williams was one of those who tried to ‘wreck’ Dr John’s chances. Dr John has instructed Alison Downie, partner and head of employment at London lawyers Goodman Derrick, to write to the Commission to suggest it risks breaching gay equality laws if it is blocking the dean over his homosexuality. Ms Downie previously acted for a gay youth worker who successfully sued the Church in 2008 after the Bishop of Hereford Anthony Priddis refused him a job. It is understood there has been a lengthy correspondence between Ms Downie and Church lawyers in an attempt to resolve the dispute. No legal action has been launched but it is thought Dr John has not ruled out the possibility, although one source said Dr John suggested he would drop his legal threat if he felt he would not be ruled out for future posts. Church lawyers published new guidelines last summer which said that under the Equality Act, candidates cannot be barred from senior Church posts because they are gay as long as they do not have sex. The guidance added that candidates could be blocked if they were regarded as divisive because their views or behaviour had angered  a significant number of their flock. Ms Downie refused to comment last night. A Church spokesman also refused to comment.","Church sources say the Very Rev Jeffrey John, Dean of St Albans, believes he could sue officials under the Equality Act 2010 ."

A scrap metal dealer who was branded 'beyond contempt' for trying to sell on a haul of memorial plaques looted from a graveyard has today been jailed for 12 weeks. Career criminal Sean McNab, 44, was arrested after staff at a scrapyard refused to buy the bronze plaques and alerted police. The thefts had been discovered when one of families went to the cemetery to lay flowers and found their plaque missing. Sean McNab said he was given the bag of plaques to sell on by two youths . Up to 20 bronze plaques had been unscrewed from the Garden of Remembrance at Blackley cemetery in Manchester last November in a night-time raid described by police 'beyond contempt'. They has been paid for by families and placed in the graveyard where the ashes of their loves ones had been interred. McNab tried to sell on the plaques – which were worth around £600 - from a bag just days after the thefts. When the yard refused he then tried to find another buyer. At first he claimed he had no idea what was in the bag but he said he later realised they were plaques and 'felt heartbroken'. He claimed that after he found this out he threw away the bag and rushed home to 'hold his bible to his chest begging for forgiveness'. Only nine plaques were recovered. At Manchester Magistrates' Court McNab, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, who has a 'significant criminal record for dishonesty' was due to stand trial for theft. But he denied the charge and pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of handling stolen goods after claiming two youths had given him the stolen plaques to sell on. JP Paul Welsh, told him: said: 'You are part of an offending chain that the community find abhorrent and it hurts people, hurts people in a wide circle. You provide a market place for this kind of activity. Only nine of the 20 stolen memorial plaques have been recovered . 'At that moment for one reason or another you didn't care. You do now because you're in court but at the time you didn't.' Earlier prosecutor Matthew Siddall, said: 'This case involves memorial plaques, the circumstances are that Blackley cemetery is the area where there are a large amount of plaques. 'One of the managers, James Birch, describes an email from one of the family members who owned one of those plaques and they had been to the cemetery and found it wasn't there. 'They had been the week before so it is understood it must have taken place that week. 'That particular manager does a check and notices ten to twenty different plaques missing, in this case we are dealing with nine of those. 'Police are alerted and take a number of enquiries particular with a scrap merchant.' Officers visited Howarth Metals on Slack Road, Blackley, as part of local inquiries on November 7. Staff said they recalled McNab trying to sell the plaques two days earlier. 'Members of staff said Sean McNab had been in the property and attempted to sell a number of memorial plaques and for obvious reasons they refused. 'Following that he came back a few days later selling copper wire. Staff managed to obtain his car registration and police saw the CCTV and they recognised him from previous dealings.' Scene: McNab took up to 20 bronze plaques from the Garden of Remembrance at Blackley cemetery in Manchester . After that McNab was arrested and his house was searched and the plaques were found in a bush not far from the scrap yard after an officer spotted the bag. Mr Siddall continued: 'It's my understanding that this defendant says he received them in a bag and never looked inside, not knowing what they were. That's not accepted by the Crown. 'His record speaks for itself, it's quite lengthy and goes over quite a number of years. When he was arrested he tested positive for opiates and cocaine. 'There's no victim impact statements but there is one off James Birch, the manager. He said, 'I feel the enormity of the stress far outweighs the value of any plaque'.' In mitigation defence solicitor Joseph O'Connor, said: 'The defendant accepts he's a person known to take scrap metal and two people came to him and said can you take this scrap metal. 'He should have been aware saying can you dispose of this scrap metal it is probably going to have come from an illegitimate source. He attempted to sell it on to a second scrap yard. 'But at the time he was provided with the large bag, he didn't engage his brain.' Mr O'Connor also added that the defendant was a carer for his father who had to undergo dialysis four times a week and relied on his son to take him to and from GP and hospital appointments. McNab was asked how he thought the families would have felt when they went to take flowers to the memorials only to find they had been stolen. McNab replied: 'I can imagine they were feeling heartbroken but you've got to understand I hadn't stolen anything.'","Sean McNab, 44, said he didn't steal them but was asked to sell them on .

"By . Emily Allen and Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 4:37 PM on 16th January 2012 . Avtar and Carole Kolar were found dead at their semi-detached home . Detectives investigating the brutal murder of a couple found dead in their home have arrested a third man. West Midlands Police confirmed a 37-year-old was arrested at a Birmingham address shortly after 1pm today, on suspicion of murdering Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife Carole, 58. A 41-year-old man questioned at the weekend on suspicion of murder was released without charge. A 24-year-old man, also arrested on suspicion of murder, is on police bail in connection with the investigation. The bodies of retired businessman Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife Carole, 58, were discovered at their home in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, by their policeman son on January 11. Post-mortem tests confirmed the couple died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head and that both had been struck a number of times. Last week a large cash reward was offered to encourage people to come forward with information about the 'atrocious' murder of the couple, who had been married for 40 years and have four children and eight grandchildren. Crimestoppers described the killing as a 'vile crime' and put up a reward of up to £10,000 for details leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. The couple were found dead at their semi-detached by their son Jason Kolar, 37, a serving police officer. He had gone to the property in Friary Road to check on them after family members had been unable to make contact. A police spokesman said forensic investigators remained at the property today, while detectives and local neighbourhood officers continue to conduct local inquiries. Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Jupp said: 'Birmingham is rightly proud of its diverse community. 'Those communities can help us find out who has done this by coming forward with information at this crucial time. 'We are extremely encouraged by the response so far and the information being passed on to us. 'Please remember all information is treated in the strictest of confidence.' Pauline Hadley, West Midlands regional manager for Crimestoppers, said: 'This is a vile crime where two people have been murdered and their family and community have been left in shock. 'Those responsible for this must be brought to justice and I would urge anyone with information that might help to contact Crimestoppers anonymously.' Last week the Kolars' four children made a desperate plea for help to catch their killers. The couple's daughter Michelle Kirwan said her parents were . ‘the sweetest, kindest people’. Referring to their brother and sister, . their four children and eight grandchildren, the 39-year-old added: . ‘Whoever has done this has taken not just two lives, but 16.’ ‘My mum and dad were the sweetest, kindest people that I have ever met and would do anything for anyone. ‘As . a family, we could not have been closer. We did everything together – . holidays, Christmas, birthdays and weddings. Our hearts are broken for . ever and our lives will never be the same,' she said. Heartbreak: Michelle Kirwan and her brother Avtar Kolar wept yesterday as they spoke about their love for their murdered parents, found dead by their police officer brother Jason in their home . Police said there was not thought to be any connection between Detective . Constable Kolar’s job and the deaths of his parents, but it remained a . ‘line of inquiry’. They are also examining possible links to a string of . break-ins by thieves targeting Asian families for gold. Gold prices have risen in the credit crunch and Asian gold is the purest available, making it particularly valuable. Birmingham . has seen a spate of such burglaries and robberies, peaking last summer . when more than 50 women were targeted for their jewellery in street . attacks in the city over just a month. Ms Kirwan told the press conference that after her family learned of the killing 'the light was switched out in our lives and our hearts have been broken forever' The . Kolars were not believed to have owned or kept significant quantities . of jewellery, but police said attackers may have targeted them in the . mistaken belief that they did. Detectives have yet to establish whether . any gold was missing from the house. Mr . Kolar described the impact of the murder on his family. ‘The hardest . thing anyone could ever do is to tell their children that they will . never see Nanny and Grandad again,’ he said. ‘I just don’t know where to . start.’ Struggling to . contain his composure, he added: ‘They were so special – not only to . us, but to everybody who ever met them. They wouldn’t hurt a fly.’ The two bodies were discovered at a house in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham . Police teams searched drains near the house as the double murder investigation got under way . Mrs . Kirwan said the couple’s grandchildren had ‘adored them’. She revealed . the family met every Friday night at her parents’ house for a meal. Her . mother would play bingo and card games with the grandchildren, giving . out sweets as prizes, she said. ‘It was noisy and chaotic, but we would never miss a week,’ Mrs Kirwan added. She said her mother also worked at an after-school club, where the children ‘adored her’. At the couple’s semi-detached home yesterday, forensic investigations continued while flowers and cards were left at the scene. A . card left with a bouquet of roses read: ‘Nanny and grandad, we love you . to the moon and back. Our life will never be complete again.’ Another . card, which read ‘In Loving Memory of a Dear Mother’ read: ‘No life . will ever be the same without you. We adore you and miss you so much.

The family of a ‘placid’ 79-year-old man who killed his dementia-suffering wife say they are devastated by the decision to send him to prison. Malcolm Beardon and his wife Margaret, 78, were childhood sweethearts who married 58 years ago and were ‘devoted and loving’. However Mrs Beardon’s dementia became so severe that she no longer knew who her husband was. He cared for her on his own at their home in Wellington, Somerset, for more than ten years ‘without ever complaining’, his family said, insisting that he would look after her ‘in sickness and in health’. But he finally snapped when his wife turned on him one evening last July, accusing him of stealing from her. He strangled her, then phoned his daughter and told her: ‘I have killed your mother. I am so sorry. She was going on and on.’ Beardon denied murdering his wife but admitted manslaughter due to loss of control, a plea accepted by the Crown. Their son begged the judge at Exeter . Crown Court to free Beardon, telling him: ‘I have lost my mother. I . don’t want to lose my father too.’ Judge Graham Cottle admitted he faced an ‘agonising sentencing exercise’. Malcolm Beardon and his wife Margaret, 78, were childhood sweethearts who married 58 years ago . The judge said the retired highways inspector was a man of ‘impeccable character’ and the crime would ‘haunt him to the end of his days’. He said that to have a partner affected by dementia was ‘both a heartrending spectacle and significant challenge’. But he added that it was not a mercy killing or an assisted suicide, and that the court must ‘recognise the principle of the sanctity of human life’. He jailed Beardon for 12 months, of which he is expected to serve six. Yesterday the family said the sentence was ‘cruel’ and ‘served no purpose.’ The couple’s son John Beardon, 42, said: ‘I cannot see any benefit to society in locking my dad up. ‘He is the most placid man . imaginable. He was completely devoted to my mother. He cared for her for . ten years and is devastated by what happened. Malcolm Beardon, 79,  arrives at Exeter Crown Court on Friday . ‘I have no idea how he will manage in prison. He is nearly 80. Obviously we are hugely worried about how he will cope.’ The court heard that in the months before her death Mrs Beardon became increasingly difficult to care for. She . was ‘unkind, critical and accusatory’ towards her husband, accusing him . of being ‘a dirty old man’ and of stealing her things. ‘Her whole personality changed,’ John Beardon said. ‘She thought my dad was just some stranger looking after her. She had no idea who he was. It was absolutely heartbreaking.’ Despite her behaviour, her husband refused to let anyone else care for her and was ‘too proud’ to accept that he needed help. ‘It must have been hellish for him,’ said Mr Beardon, an IT consultant. ‘But he was very old-fashioned and thought it was his duty to look after her. He insisted he could manage.’ Six weeks before her death, Mrs Beardon was seen by a nurse who said she needed a full psychiatric evaluation. Tragically, she was still waiting to see a doctor when she died, the family said. ‘If she had been provided with the help she needed, we would not be in this position today,’ her son said. The couple's son, John Beardon, pictured said he did not blame his father for his mother's death 'for a second' On the night of her death, Mrs . Beardon was abusive when her husband asked her to undress for bed. He . ‘flipped’ and strangled her, the court heard. His . son, who lives with his wife Sally in Taunton, Somerset, said he did . not blame his father for his mother’s death ‘for a second’. ‘As far as I’m concerned, we didn’t lose our mum that night,’ he said. ‘She had already gone.’ He said that before her illness his mother was a ‘strong character’ who loved spending time with family and friends and ‘would do anything for anyone’. ‘She was a wonderful mother and a really selfless person. ‘She and my father were the sort of married couple that most people want to be like – happy, loving, completely devoted to each other.’ Mr Michael Fitton, QC, defending, said the case was ‘a tragedy for all concerned’. He added: ‘Mr Beardon has killed his best friend, his wife of 58 years at the home they shared for 50 years. ‘Everybody says he was a genuinely loving husband who has lost his lifetime companion.’","Couple who married 58 years ago were ‘devoted and loving’

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Last updated at 8:23 AM on 16th January 2012 . The widow of the Oxford professor who died at a colleague’s home has told him she does not blame him for the tragedy. Police arrested mathematician Dr Devinder Sivia after his friend, world-renowned astrophysicist Professor Steven Rawlings, was found dead following a scuffle at his bungalow. Dr Sivia’s family say the professor’s wife Linda had called him on the night of the death because she was worried about her husband’s ‘emotional state’. Dr Devinder Singh pictured left, was arrested on suspicion of the murder of his friend Prof Steven Rawlings, pictured right but has been bailed until April . The Sikh academic then had dinner with Professor Rawlings at a pub before taking his friend of more than 30 years back to his home. He told his family that Professor Rawlings, 50, was ‘very emotional’, attacked him and collapsed with a suspected heart attack while he was restraining him. Dr Sivia, 49, was arrested on suspicion of murder, but later released on police bail. Detectives believe no criminal offence was committed. Mrs Rawlings has called both Dr Sivia . and his family to say that she does not blame him for her husband’s . death last Wednesday night. Dr . Sivia’s brother, Gurdip, 59, a warehouse worker from Birmingham, said: . ‘I have spoken to my brother and he is very upset about this tragedy as . Steven was a close friend. Speaking out: Professor Rawlings' widow Linda (left) yesterday said she believes the death of her husband (right) was a 'tragic accident' ‘It was an accident, it was a tragic accident. Steven was out of control and in his mental state attacked my brother. 'My brother defended himself and it looks like while restraining him he had a heart attack. ‘Linda has called my brother and says . she doesn’t blame him as she was the one who asked him to go to the pub . and talk to Steven. She gave him instructions to talk to Steven at the . pub because he was in an emotional state.’ During . dinner at the Bear Hotel in Wantage, Dr Sivia became increasingly . concerned about his friend’s behaviour. Staff at the inn said the . professor, a regular visitor, was unusually subdued. Three decades ago: The friends circled in their first year at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1981 . Dr Sivia invited him to stay at his bungalow in Southmoor, near Abingdon, but when they got to his home his friend apparently became increasingly agitated and attacked him. Dr Sivia dialled 999 and alerted . neighbours when he collapsed, but despite their efforts to resuscitate . him he died at the scene. It . has also emerged that Professor Rawlings had to step down from the team . building the world’s largest radio telescope after struggling with . mental health problems since summer last year. He had played a huge part . in developing the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a telescope which will . be able to look 13billion years back in time to the beginnings of the . universe. But he was unable to complete his project . and also dropped out of his academic work at Oxford University’s St . Peter’s College last summer. Lecturer: Dr Sivia worked in the maths department at St John's college in Oxford . Investigation: Police stand outside the property in Southmoor, Oxford, where Professor Steven Rawlings body was found . Guard: A police officer stands outside the home of Dr Sivia after the force launched a murder investigation into the death of Professor Rawlings . Professor Phil Diamond, who had worked with Professor Rawlings on the SKA scheme, said: ‘He became withdrawn and dropped out of both his academic work and the SKA. ‘I was told he suffered some mental problems but I don’t know what caused them.’ Detective Superintendent Rob Mason, from Thames Valley Police’s major crime unit, said: ‘We are mindful that ultimately the death may be a matter for a coroner’s inquest rather than a criminal court and I would ask for patience from both the media and the public while we continue our investigation.’","Dr Devinder Sivia's family said widow called them to say that she does not blame Sivia for husband Steven Rawlings' death .

"By . Beth Stebner . Last updated at 11:06 AM on 16th January 2012 . Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman will drop out of the presidential race today, and will instead endorse fellow candidate Mitt Romney, a senior campaign aide confirmed Sunday night. The official said Mr Huntsman was ‘proud of the race he ran.' Mr Huntsman's rationale to back Mr Romney - a man he’s consistently criticised on the campaign trail and called an ‘establishment’ - comes because he doesn't want to block the best candidate to beat President Obama in the upcoming elections, according to an aide. He was scheduled to participate in an evening debate in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Monday evening, but will instead endorse Mr Romney at an 11am press conference. Just announced: Republican presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman walks with wife Mary Kaye and daughter Gracie in South Carolina. The former Utah governor will drop out of the presidential race, according to reports . Defeat: According to reports, Huntsman was running out of money to fund his campaign . The former Utah governor came third in last week’s New Hampshire primary despite devoting much of his campaign resources to the state. He had already acknowledged that expectations for him in South Carolina’s primary this week will be ‘very low.’ Mr Huntsman was routinely at the bottom of national polls, barely registering at one or two per cent, despite entering the race with high expectations. Funding his campaign also became a struggle, as he arrived in South Carolina with very little money. Making it official: Huntsman will announce the end of his campaign and his endorsement of Mitt Romney in a news conference Monday . This comes six days before the state’s Republican presidential primary. Earlier on Sunday, he received an endorsement from South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The State. The paper’s editorial board praised the . candidate’s principles and ‘far more impressive resume’ than Republican . favourite Mitt Romney. 'He has not put forth reason to give us a reason for us to trust him.' -Jon Huntsman, on if he trusts Mitt Romney . When asked in an interview with ABC News earlier this month if he trusts Mr Romney, Mr Huntsman responded: ‘He has not put forth reason to give us a reason for us to trust him.’ But he also told an ABC reporter that Mr Romney is ‘completely out of touch’ and touted his much-debated time at Bain Capital. When asked in an interview with ABC News earlier this month if he trusts Mr Romney, Mr Huntsman responded: ‘He has not put forth reason to give us a reason for us to trust him.’ But he also told an ABC reporter that Mr Romney is ‘completely out of touch’ and touted his much-debated time at Bain Capital. He said: ‘My problem is really about a political issue. And that is, when you have a candidate that talks about enjoyment in firing people, talks about pink-slips, who makes comment that seem to be so detached from the problems that Americans are facing today, that makes you pretty much unelectable.’ A single man: Despite speaking out against Mitt Romney, Huntsman will reportedly endorse him as the GOP candidate . Mr Huntsman joins the three candidates who have now dropped out of the race. Former governor of Minnesota Tim Pawlenty dropped out after low numbers at the Iowa straw poll last summer, and Rep Michele Bachmann, also of Minnesota, dropped out after a disappointing turn at the Iowa Caucus. Former Godfather’s Pizza CEO Herman Cain ended his bid for the White House after flurries of sexual harassment allegations were brought to light. Mr Huntsman joins Mr Pawlenty in the endorsement of the former Massachusetts governor. Mrs Bachmann and Mr Cain have yet to announce support of the remaining candidates. Endorsed: According to reports, Huntsman will endorse Romney after himself getting endorsed by South Carolina's largest paper . His resume suggested he could be a major . contender for the GOP nomination: businessman, diplomat, governor, . veteran of four presidential administrations, an expert on China and on . foreign trade. With a personal fortune based on his family's global chemical company, he could be a late entry into the nomination contest without necessarily hobbling his campaign. Yet Mr Huntsman was almost invisible in a race often dominated by Mr Romney, a fellow Mormon. One reason was timing. For months, Mr Romney and other declared or expected-to-declare candidates drew media attention and wooed voters in early primary states. Mr Huntsman, meanwhile, was half a world away, serving as ambassador to China until he resigned in late April. Nearly two more months would pass before his kick-off speech on June 22 in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. Third place: Huntsman finished third in last week's New Hampshire primary despite devoting much of his campaign resources to the state . To distinguish his candidacy in a crowded field, Mr Huntsman positioned himself as a tax-cutting, budget-balancing chief executive and former business executive who could rise above partisan politics. That would prove to be a hard sell to the conservatives dominating the early voting contests, especially in an election cycle marked by bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats and a boiling antipathy for President Barack Obama. Mr Huntsman also tried to offer a different tenor, promising a campaign marked by civility. 'I don't think you need to run down somebody's reputation in order to run for the office of president,' he said. So long: Republican Jon Huntsman waves as he arrives to announce his bid for the presidency at Liberty State Park in New Jersey on June 21 of last year . While Mr Huntsman was often critical of his former boss - he joined those saying Mr Obama had failed as a leader - and occasionally jabbed at Mr Romney, he spent more of his time in debates pushing his own views for improving the economy than thumping the president or his opponents. In light of his work in the Obama administration, Republicans seemed wary of Mr Huntsman. While he cast his appointment in August 2009 as U.S. ambassador to China as answering the call to serve his country, his critics grumbled that he had in fact been working on behalf of the opposition. Former governor Jon Huntsman served as ambassador to China until 2009 . Jon Meade Huntsman Jr., 51, was born on March 26, 1960 in Redwood City, California, the eldest of nine. His father, also Jon Huntsman, founded the successful Huntsman Corporation in 1982. The company is today worth more than $9billion. Mr Huntsman attended high school in Salt Lake City but dropped out to play keyboards in a band. He later attended the University of Utah, then dropped out to serve two years as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan, where he learned to speak Mandarin. He returned to the University of Utah in 1981 and later worked as an intern for Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and as a staff assistant to President Ronald Reagan. He left college to join the Huntsman Corporation in 1983, the same year he married Mary Kaye Cooper. Mr Huntsman studied international politics at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor's degree in 1987. While he served in the administrations of both George H.W. Bush - he was ambassador to Singapore in 1992 - and George W. Bush, Mr Huntsman first won elective office in 2004 as Utah's governor. He was re-elected by a 3-1 margin in 2008, then resigned the following year to be America's top diplomat in China under the Obama administration. Mr Huntsman and his wife have seven children, including one adopted from India and one adopted from China.","Jon Huntsman will officially announce withdraw Monday, several aides say .

"Covlin was recently blocked from . gaining further access to the $1.6million life-insurance-policy payout . she left for their children. By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 5:23 PM on 16th January 2012 . Dead: Shele Danishefsky Covlin's husband claims she wanted to be buried in Israel where her body would never have been exhumed . The husband of a wealthy UBS executive tried to have his estranged wife buried in Israel -  which would have prevented her body from being exhumed and the resulting autopsy that revealed she had been murdered. The rabbi and the brother-in-law of Shele Danishefsky both said no one in the family knew of her supposed wishes to be buried in Israel. They added that had it been carried out , no one would have they learned she had been strangled in her Upper West Side apartment. Shele Danishefsky was found dead on . New Year's Eve 2009 by her estranged husband and their then . nine-year-old daughter Anna in the bathroom of their apartment. It was . at first ruled as an accidental falling. It . later emerged that the mother-of-two was suing Covlin for civil . divorce, had a restraining order against him and was scheduled to meet . the next day with her lawyer to remove him from her will. Brother-in-law Marc Karstaedt has also accused Rob Covlin of upsetting his wife's family even further by placing a stone marker on her grave which read 'beloved mother and wife', despite the fact she obtained a religious divorce from him before her 2009 death. Nothing on the grave stone at Westchester County cemetery mentioned her parents or siblings, despite the fact they pleaded with him to include them. Mr Karstaedt told the New York Post that his wife Eve, Shele's sister 'wept hysterically' when she first saw the grave stone. He said: 'We stood there together, shattered, . incredulous that anyone would contemplate such a despicable act — let . alone act on it,' after they visited the Jewish cemetery site . with his wife on the second Hebrew calendar anniversary of Shele’s . murder. Rabbi Shaul Robinson, who was also a close friend of the 47-year-old, told the Post of the marker: 'I knew that was absolutely . not what Shele would have wanted on her grave. I cannot tell you how . strongly she didn’t want to have anything to do with Covlin. 'It was very wrong to maintain or imply that there was a loving marital relationship when she died, because there was not.' Accused: Rod Covlin, centre, pictured with his mother and attorney after he appeared in court last April over custody of their children. he has been temporarily blocked from accessing his wife's estate . Last April, Covlin filed papers in Westchester County . Surrogate’s Court asking to be named guardian of the cashed-in . Aetna policy that his wife had left for their children Anna, now 11, and . Myles, five. But he was recently blocked from . gaining further access to the $1.6million life-insurance-policy payout . she left for their children. A source told The New York Post Covlin . had been listed as the beneficiary of the insurance policy but Shele . changed it to her children four weeks before she died. Covlin, a former stock trader and backgammon player, remains the focus of the murder probe by the Manhattan's DA office. His lawyer Robert Gottlieb maintains . his 38-year-old client's innocence and criticised the family for not . respecting Shele's wishes involving her burial. He said: 'There’s no question that . Shele told Rod, her husband, that she wanted to be buried in Israel. In . 2008, they visited Israel, they visited her family’s area, where members . of her family are buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. He also said that Covlin discussed . with his 'very mature' daughter about what to put on the grave stone and . where to have her buried and they came to the decision together. 'As I understand it, they weren’t . divorced at the time, and Anna, who again is a very mature 11-year-old, . wanted that,' Mr Gottlieb told the Post. 'To attack what’s written on . the stone is just grossly inappropriate, and very sad.' Scene: Her body was found in the bath tub of her apartment in the Upper West Side of Manhattan by her daughter and husband. Her purse and cell phone were missing . Rabbi Robinson said no one in his . family could believe that Shele would want to have been buried in Israel . as she had twins girls who died at birth and were buried in a New York . cemetery plot. They believed she would have wanted to be buried beside . them. Mr Karstaedt added: 'We . found it unbelievable that Shele would have shared that wish with . [Covlin] and not with other family members with whom she was so . close.' Because of Orthodox Jewish practice . which does not allow autopsies, Shele was buried without one being . performed. But when the family grew suspicious that the 47-year-old had . fallen victim to foul play, her body was exhumed and an autopsy . performed, which found her death was by strangulation and not accidental . falling. In December, a wrongful death lawsuit was filed by the Manhattan public administrator against the former stock trader. The . suit charged that Covlin 'intentionally, deliberately, willfully, . wantonly, maliciously, brutally and without provocation or just cause . did strangle, choke, strike, injure, assault, abuse, beat and murder' his wife. Fall: Shele Covlin was found in the bath tub of her apartment (file photo) by her daughter with a gash to her head so her death was ruled as accidental . A week later it emerged he had been blocked from gaining further access to the account and stripped of his powers to control it. Although both of the couple's children . stand to inherit the money when they are 18, the 39-year-old does have . the power to invest and can apply for the court to withdraw cash. Covlin lives in Westchester County with his children. Shele’s brother Philip Danishefsky is seeking custody of the kids. If he is indicted and found guilty of . killing his wife, he will lose his share of her estate, all of which . would go to the children. He has never been arrested or charged in her death. At the time of her death, the . unemployed Covlin was living across the hall from his former wife and . their daughter and son, all of whom had an order of protection against . him. After the daughter found Shele in the bathroom, she went to get her dad and let him in the apartment. Sources . told The Post that in the aftermath of Shele’s death, her purse and . smart-phone went missing. Both contained her schedule for meetings with a . lawyer to discuss removing Rod from her will.","Rabbi of Shele Danishefsky said she told no one else in her family she wanted to be buried in Israel .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 4:45 PM on 16th January 2012 . A third of Italians think it would be better for their country to return to the lira, a poll has revealed today. The survey, published in the Corriere della Sella, also said 65 per cent of those polled thought the introduction of the single currency had been more damaging than beneficial for the Italian economy. And confidence in the European Union stands at its lowest level in many years - just 51 per cent. Step backwards? A third of Italians would prefer to ditch the euro and return to using the lira . Confidence: Nine eurozone countries had their credit ratings downgraded by Standard & Poor's on Friday as the European debt crisis continues . The poll, by ISPO, highlights growing concerns over the future of the single currency among Italians as the eurozone's third largest economy struggles with a spreading debt crisis that has pushed its borrowing costs to unsustainable levels. The technocrat government of Prime Minister Mario Monti, appointed in November, has pushed through a painful austerity budget including tax hikes and spending cuts that are hitting Italians hard. Mr Monti's approval rating rose to 56 per cent from 46 per cent a month ago, the survey showed, as the Italian economy heads towards recession. Some 31 per cent said they would prefer a return to the lira, although 60 per cent said Italy had had to join the euro and there was no going back. Italy, who debt-to-GDP ratio is second worst only to Greece at 120 per cent, was among a raft of European countries hit by a mass downgrade from Standard & Poor's on Friday. Its sovereign rating was cut by two notches to BBB+. It comes as French President Nicolas Sarkozy secured a small boost for his country's economy after Moody's rating agency maintained its triple A rating. Just days after rival Standard and Poor's downgraded the country's debt over concerns about Europe's ability to handle the crisis, the markets appeared to brush off the decision to cut ratings in nine countries. The downgrades were expected, but they served as a reminder that the 17 countries in the euro zone have a long way to deal with the debt crisis. Foundations: People stage a protest outside the Standard & Poor's HQ building in Paris after the agency downgraded France's coveted triple A rating . Debt crisis: Borrowing costs for government bonds in the eurozone are already high and countries like Italy and Greece have been forced to adopt severe austerity measures . Mr Sarkozy, who is campaigning ahead of the presidential election in April, travelled to Spain today. During a visit with Spanish King Juan Carlos, he said: 'Spain and France have a lot to do so that Europe can get out of the repeated crises that it has been in for the last three years.' In its announcement, Moody's cited the French economy's overall strength but said bleak growth prospects presented 'risks to the French government's fiscal consolidation plans'. It said: 'France, like other eurozone sovereigns, may face a number of challenges in the coming months. 'The need to provide additional support to other European sovereigns or to its own banking system cannot be excluded. In that case this could give rise to significant new (contingent) liabilities for the government's balance sheet.' At the same time, MPs in Germany warned that the euro zone bailout fund's volume must be maintained and countries downgraded by S&P should have to provide more guarantees to preserve its triple A status. Desperate: An elderly homeless man prepares to sleep in front of a bank in Athens, Greece. The country faces difficult talks with the IMF this week as it tries to secure a second bailout . Tough: Economists have warned of a second recession in Europe this year as countries using the single currency struggle to cope with debt levels . Austerity: Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's government has pushed through tax hikes and spending cuts, but he has increased his popularity . Michael Meister, deputy leader of the conservatives in the Bundestag, said: 'The total volume of the EFSF must be maintained. 'Germany was not downgraded so our contribution should not be changed. Countries that were affected must contribute more to the guarantees.' Greece is gearing up for another tough week of negotiations on the country's crucial second bailout as it tries to revive talks with private investors. Government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis said: 'This is a crucial time for the Greek economy... the negotiations are very difficult. 'It is understood that there will be renewed pressure (from the debt inspectors) to speed up structural reforms.' International debt inspectors from the so-called 'troika' - the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission - are expected to arrive in Athens on Friday. An integral part of the €130billion second bailout is a bond swap deal with private creditors that is crucial to avoid a devastating default. Those talks appeared close to collapse on Friday amid disagreements over the interest rates of new bonds. They are likely to resume this week. Known as the Private Sector Involvement, or PSI, the talks aim to reduce Greece's debt by €100billion by swapping creditors' bonds with new ones with a 50 per cent lower face value. Without it, the country could suffer a catastrophic bankruptcy that would send shock waves through the global economy. Last week, the European Central Bank stepped up its purchases of government bonds to €3.8billion, a tool that has helped keep indebted eurozone goverments from financial collapse. The news saw the markets give mixed reactions today. The FTSE was up 0.43 per cent at 5,660.78 this afternoon while the DOW fell 0.39 per cent.","Italian poll reveals 65% though introduction of euro had damaged the country .

The new female face of the popular U.S. sport of drag racing is being hailed at the 'next generation driver' and already gaining the attention of lucrative sponsors. Courtney Force - the youngest of four daughters is following in her father John Force's footsteps - one of America's most successful drag racers. Miss Force will be making her debut in the most prestigious racing series of the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) - marking a breakthrough for women drivers in the sport long dominated by men. Fast driver: Courtney Force, pictured is following her father into drag racing . Women drivers have participated in other forms of racing such as Formula One, where Maria Teresa de Filippis from Italy was the first to compete in a race in Monaco in 1958. But the category of drag racing - also known in the industry as Funny Cars - was dominated by Miss Force's father, a 15-time national champion. The 23-year-old recalled last week how she used to dream of racing her father by drawing pictures of herself in a car alongside him in a long skinny-nosed dragster. She now has a promising . career in her own right as she was rewarded with a new car - a Traxxas . Ford Mustang on graduating from college. Endorsement: The 23-year-old, pictured left, is being sponsored by Traxxas, a maker of remote-controlled cars . The fierce vehicle lets her hit 300mph within seconds of flooring the . accelerator. She told The Sunday Times: 'Now I get my own 8,000hp, 300mph Ford, I can't wait to start beating up on the boys, especially my dad.' A passion for racing clearly runs in the family as Courtney's elder sister Ashley was the first to demonstrate that female racers could compete successfully with men when she became the first woman to win a Funny Car event in 2008. She exceeded 300mph, beating her father in the final quarter-mile event. John Force, 62, is looking forward to competing against his daughter . Mike Jenkins of Traxxas, a maker of remote-controlled cars, which this year is sponsoring Courtney Force said: 'We are all motorheads, racers and adrenaline junkies. 'Our driver is Courtney Force, NHRA's newest hero. She's not just another girl at the racetrack, she's a girl that has real John Force DNA embedded in her and it shows'. Force's popularity coincides with the success of established racing star, Danica Patrick, an American auto racing driver cited as a potential future Formula One racer. The 29-year-old will be taking part in the Nascar Sprint Cup this season - the most prestigious U.S. stock car racing series. Currently the most successful driver in U.S, automobile racing history, her third-place finish at the 2009 Indianapolis 500 is the best performance by a woman at America's most famous racing circuit. Miss Force said: 'I loved going to the races as a kid and getting dirty working on the car, grease all over me. 'I have my girlie side too by I loved being a tomboy at the track.' John Force who is still competing aged 62 said he looked forward to racing against his daughter.

Margaret Thatcher 'did not get' who David Cameron was when the Prime Minister's name cropped up at a dinner party, a former Conservative politician has revealed. In a telling indication of the Iron Lady's battle with dementia, Jonathan Aitken revealed that Mrs Thatcher seemed to be unaware of who the current British Prime Minister was when he was mentioned by another guest at the dinner table. The biopic of Margaret Thatcher, The Iron Lady, has attracted controversy for its portrayal of her illness. And now it seems Mr Aitken, who is writing a book about the formidable former Prime Minister, is fanning the flames by revealing his own account of her dementia. Mrs Thatcher attended a dinner party at Mr Aitken's house when another guest - also a politician - started talking about Mr Cameron, it was reported. Mr Aitken, a former Tory minister, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I had one member of the cabinet [at the table] who asked something about David Cameron. 'She obviously didn't get who David Cameron was. I can't ever say I felt protective to her when she was in power, but I felt very lovingly protective towards her then.' Mr Aitken, whose political career ended in a spectacular fall from grace in the late 1990s, gave a revealing account of what it is like to be in Mrs Thatcher's company since the onset of her dementia. Political colleagues: Margaret Thatcher with Jonathan Aitken in 2001. He says he is fonder of her now than when she was in power . From one PM to another: Margaret Thatcher outside Number 10 with David Cameron in 2010. However, it has been claimed she 'didn't get' who he was . He revealed that, at a time when she . attended a dinner party he was hosting, her confused state-of-mind was . peppered with moments of clarity as she joined the dinner table . conversation. He told the . Sunday Telegraph: 'When she came in [to the conversation] there were one . or two marvellous moments. She suddenly started to talk about . [politician] Keith Joseph, then later about preparations for her . wedding.' Mr Aitken also revealed how he was 'fundamentally disappointed' in The Iron Lady - the biopic of her life, starring Meryl Streep. The film has been criticised for its portrayal of Mrs Thatcher's illness while she is still alive - a point reiterated by Mr Aitken. 'Marvellous acting'... but Jonathan Aitken said The Iron Lady biopic made him 'uncomfortable' and 'upset' While he praised Streep's performance, . he added: 'I felt uncomfortable and a bit upset about the vehicle of the . dementia-ridden lady who flips in and out.' Mr Aitken admitted he is fonder of Mrs Thatcher now than during her Number 10 years. While she was in power he was a backbench MP and it wasn't until John Major became Prime Minister that he joined the cabinet. However, he suffered a dramatic fall from grace in 1999 when he was jailed for 18 months for perjury after he lied on oath during a libel case. Mr Aitken remains the only serving cabinet minister to ever go to prison and, remarkably, he says it was the Thatchers who were among the kindest when he was released after serving seven months of his sentence. While many of his friends deserted him while he was in prison, Denis and Margaret Thatcher went out of their way to welcome the disgraced minister back into political circles by inviting him to dinner - a gesture Mr Aitken says he will never forget.",Iron Lady was confused when cabinet member mentioned Prime Minister's name .

The BBC versions of Great Expectations and the Mystery of Edwin Drood have created a resurgence of interest in the Victorian writer. It means Dickens could find himself back among the bestsellers' list alongside modern authors JK Rowling, Stig Larsson and Stephen King. Great Expectations: Popularity of the BBC version, which starred Douglas Booth as Pip, right, and Estella, Vanessa Kirby, has led to increased interest in the books . BBC hit: Great Expectations attracted a quarter of the audience share when it screened on December 27. Here Douglas Booth plays Pip and Gillian Anderson is Miss Havisham . An audience of more than six million watched Great Expectations on the BBC over Christmas. In the TV adaptation Douglas Booth, 19, starred as teenage Pip, alongside actors Ray Winstone and Gillian Anderson. It was followed by The Mystery of Edwin Drood which was watched by three million people when the first part of it was screened last week. Dickens died before the novel was finished so television scriptwriter Gwyneth Hughes wrote her own ending. Popular: Miss Havisham with a young Pip played by Oscar Kennedy in the TV adaptation of Great Expectations . Publishers' payday: Royalties don't have to be paid on Charles Dickens' novels because the copyright has expired . Melanie Harris, of Waterstones, said there had been new interest in the Victorian author because of the success of the television shows. 'The feast of Dickens themed TV over Christmas and the New Year has got people talking about Dickens again,' she said. 'A lot of readers watched Great Expectations and realised they have never read the book. 'We have definitely seen a resurgence of interest in Dickens and a number of fabulous new editions of his classic tales are now on the shelves.' Amazon and WH Smith also say Dickens is back in fashion thanks to the TV adaptation of Great Expectations. It means a big payday for publishers as there are no royalties to be paid because Dickens died so long ago. Dickens . is top of the charts for the best-selling single volume of all time . with A Tale of Two Cities which has sold more than 200 million copies.

Police have arrested a second man in connection with the murder of a couple who were found dead in their home. The 41-year-old is being questioned by detectives, police confirmed. A 24-year-old man arrested in Birmingham . on Friday remains in custody and is helping officers with their enquiries, West Midlands Police said today. The bodies of retired businessman Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife Carole, 58, were discovered at their home in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, by their policeman son on Wednesday morning. Post-mortem tests confirmed the couple died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head and that both had been struck a number of times. Earlier this week a large cash reward was offered to encourage people to come forward with information about the 'atrocious' murder of the couple, who had been married for 40 years and have four children and eight grandchildren. Crimestoppers described the killing as a 'vile crime' and put up a reward of up to £10,000 for details leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. The couple were found dead at their semi-detached by their son Jason Kolar, 37, a serving police officer. He had gone to the property in Friary Road to check on them after family members had been unable to make contact. Pauline Hadley, West Midlands regional manager for Crimestoppers, said: 'This is a vile crime where two people have been murdered and their family and community have been left in shock. 'Those responsible for this must be brought to justice and I would urge anyone with information that might help to contact Crimestoppers anonymously.' Speaking earlier this week Detective Superintendent Richard Baker, who is leading the murder investigation, said: 'I would like to thank Crimestoppers for offering this reward and say again that local people hold the key to finding who is responsible for this terrible tragedy. 'If you believe that you have any piece of information that may help our enquiries, I would ask you to call us or Crimestoppers as soon as possible.' Also this week the Kolars' four children made a desperate plea for help to catch their killers. The couple's daughter Michelle Kirwan said her parents were . ‘the sweetest, kindest people’. Referring to their brother and sister, . their four children and eight grandchildren, the 39-year-old added: . ‘Whoever has done this has taken not just two lives, but 16.’ ‘My mum and dad were the sweetest, kindest people that I have ever met and would do anything for anyone. ‘As . a family, we could not have been closer. We did everything together – . holidays, Christmas, birthdays and weddings. Our hearts are broken for . ever and our lives will never be the same,' she said. Heartbreak: Michelle Kirwan and her brother Avtar Kolar wept yesterday as they spoke about their love for their murdered parents, found dead by their police officer brother Jason in their home . Police said there was not thought to be any connection between Detective . Constable Kolar’s job and the deaths of his parents, but it remained a . ‘line of inquiry’. They are also examining possible links to a string of . break-ins by thieves targeting Asian families for gold. Gold prices have risen in the credit crunch and Asian gold is the purest available, making it particularly valuable. Birmingham . has seen a spate of such burglaries and robberies, peaking last summer . when more than 50 women were targeted for their jewellery in street . attacks in the city over just a month. Ms Kirwan told the press conference that after her family learned of the killing 'the light was switched out in our lives and our hearts have been broken forever' The . Kolars were not believed to have owned or kept significant quantities . of jewellery, but police said attackers may have targeted them in the . mistaken belief that they did. Detectives have yet to establish whether . any gold was missing from the house. Mrs Kirwan was joined at yesterday’s press conference in Birmingham by her younger brother Avtar, 32. Mr . Kolar described the impact of the murder on his family. ‘The hardest . thing anyone could ever do is to tell their children that they will . never see Nanny and Grandad again,’ he said. ‘I just don’t know where to . start.’ Struggling to . contain his composure, he added: ‘They were so special – not only to . us, but to everybody who ever met them. They wouldn’t hurt a fly.’ The two bodies were discovered at a house in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham . Police teams searched drains near the house as the double murder investigation got under way . Mrs . Kirwan said the couple’s grandchildren had ‘adored them’. She revealed . the family met every Friday night at her parents’ house for a meal. Her . mother would play bingo and card games with the grandchildren, giving . out sweets as prizes, she said. ‘It was noisy and chaotic, but we would never miss a week,’ Mrs Kirwan added. She said her mother also worked at an after-school club, where the children ‘adored her’. At the couple’s semi-detached home yesterday, forensic investigations continued while flowers and cards were left at the scene. A . card left with a bouquet of roses read: ‘Nanny and grandad, we love you . to the moon and back. Our life will never be complete again.’ Another . card, which read ‘In Loving Memory of a Dear Mother’ read: ‘No life . will ever be the same without you. We adore you and miss you so much.

A mother has spoken of her hurt and outrage after she found out the brain of her six-week-old baby had been kept in a jar at Southampton General Hospital for 13 years. Julie Middleton, 40, buried her son Regan in 1999 but has now been told that doctors removed his brain during a post-mortem at the medical centre. She said although she knew tissues had been removed to ascertain the cause of death - which was found to be cot death - she had no idea the entire organ had been removed. Baby Regan's brain was found in a jar at Southampton General Hospital . The organ was held in storage until it was . discovered during a national audit into remains kept by police. Similar cases of organs being kept without the knowledge of their loved ones are likely to emerge as the audit continues. It could trigger another organ 'harvesting' scandal like the one at . Alder Hey hospital in 1999. The mother-of-four, who lives in Poole, said she felt that the authorities had 'stolen' a piece of her baby. She told the Southern Daily Echo: 'I feel hurt and let down by people I thought I could trust at the worst time in my life. I trusted them with my son's body and they returned it to me incomplete.' A spokesman for Southampton General Hospital said Regan had not been a patient there and they had been asked to keep the organ at the request of the Home Office and Dorset police as part of a forensic case for the coroner. 'We are asked to hold these specimens at the request of the police/coroner . until told what they want us to do,' he said. The brain will now be buried alongside Regan's body although Ms Middleton and her former husband Michael Wilson said they would be too upset to attend. 'It will be too painful,' Ms Middleton told the Echo. 'I thought I had said good-bye to Regan all those years ago. I can't go through it again.' Their other choices were to allow the brain to be kept for medical research or have the hospital 'dispose' of it. But Ms Middleton said: 'I wasn't going to let them keep it.' Dorset Police released a statement saying: 'We are very aware of the sensitivities of . the families affected and are working closely with hospitals, pathologists . and coroner's departments to complete the audit and inform families as . quickly as possible. 'We know this is incredibly difficult for the family and friends of those . people whose tissue we have identified and we are providing all the support . we can to help them.'","Mother thought her baby boy was whole when he was buried .

"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 2:10 AM on 17th January 2012 . A virtually untreatable strain of the killer lung disease tuberculosis has infected at least 12 slum dwellers in India, it was revealed today. The hospital in Mumbai that saw the initial . cases, India's first, tested a dozen medicines on the patients but none of them worked. A TB expert at the U.S. Centers for . Disease Control and Prevention said they do appear to be totally . resistant to available drugs. In danger: In India, experts believe there could be many undocumented cases of drug-resistant TB . 'It is concerning,' said Dr Kenneth . Castro, director of the CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination. 'Anytime we see something like this, we better get on top of it before . it becomes a more widespread problem.' It's not the first time drug-resistant cases like this have been seen. Since 2003, patients have been documented in Italy and Iran. In India, the strain has mostly been limited to impoverished areas, and has not spread widely. But experts believe there could be many undocumented cases. No one expects the Indian TB strains to rapidly spread elsewhere. The airborne disease is mainly transmitted through close personal contact and isn't nearly as contagious as the flu. Indeed, most of the cases of this kind of TB were not from person-to-person infection but were mutations that occurred in poorly treated patients. The tuberculosis virus, pictured here, is an age-old scourge that lies dormant in an estimated one in three people worldwide . What's more, there's a debate within the public health community about whether to even label TB infections as totally drug resistant. The World Health Organisation hasn't accepted the term and still considers the cases to be what's now called extensively drug-resistant TB, or XDR. However, Dr Paul Nunn, a coordinator at the WHO's Stop TB Department in Geneva, said there is ample proof that these virtually untreatable cases do exist. Ordinary TB is easily cured by taking antibiotics for six to nine months. However, if that treatment is interrupted or the dose is cut down, the stubborn bacteria battle back and mutate into a tougher strain that can no longer be killed by standard drugs. The disease becomes harder and more expensive to treat. Tuberculosis is an age-old scourge . that lies dormant in an estimated one in three people worldwide. About . 10 per cent of those people eventually develop active TB, which kills . roughly two million a year, according to the WHO. Each victim infects an average of 10 to 15 others every year, typically through sneezing or coughing. If . a TB case is found to be resistant to the two most powerful anti-TB . drugs, the patient is classified as having multi drug-resistant TB . (MDR). An even worse classification of TB - one the WHO accepts - is . extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR), a form of the disease that was . first reported in 2006 and is virtually resistant to all drugs. An . estimated 20 per cent of the world's multi-drug-resistant cases are . found in India, which is home to a quarter of all types of tuberculosis . cases worldwide. Doctors at the Mumbai hospital have reported a total of 12 patients who failed initial treatment and also didn't respond to the medicines tried next over an average of two to three years. Three have died. None of the others have been successfully treated. The doctors detailed the first four cases in a letter to a U.S. medical journal last month, blaming private doctors for prescribing inappropriate drug plans that sparked greater resistance in three of those four patients. 'These three patients had received erratic, unsupervised second-line drugs, added individually and often in incorrect doses, from multiple private practitioners,' wrote the doctors from P.D. Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Center in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. One of the doctors, Zarir Udwadia, in a phone interview, said there is little hope for the surviving nine patients, all poor slum dwellers living in the community. He said he has detected one case of a mother passing the strain to a daughter living in close quarters. One of the patients was also infected with HIV, which typically results in faster death. Dr Udwadia criticised the testing and treatment methods of the Indian government's TB program, which he says forces patients to turn to private doctors, many of whom do not understand how to properly treat TB or the risks of increasing drug resistance by prescribing the wrong drugs. 'It was a given that this would happen,' Dr Udwadia said. 'They have had no help from the Indian TB system. They are the untouchables, so no one is making a fuss. They don't have the power to vocalize. There's going to be more family contacts. It's going to spread for sure.' India's Health Ministry did not respond to phone calls and written requests for comment today and last week. Similar highly resistant cases have been noted before. In 2003, two Italian women died and there were 15 cases reported from Iran in 2009. That same year, it was reported on a case of a Peruvian teenager who was infected at home but diagnosed while visiting Florida. He was successfully treated for a year and a half with experimental high doses of medicines not typically used for TB, costing about $500,000. Those resources are unthinkable in the developing world, where TB remains a menacing killer and where few hospitals can perform tests to find out which antibiotics might work. 'For there to be another report coming out from India is no surprise at all. Indeed, in a sense, it's surprising it's taken so long,' said WHO's Dr Nunn. This is 'yet another alarm call for countries and others engaged in TB control to do their jobs properly.'","Doctors say there are at least 12 cases in Mumbai .

"Incident reported just months after 4-year-old suffered a similar fate in ANOTHER Swedish hospital . By . David Gerges . Last updated at 4:18 PM on 16th January 2012 . A doctor in Sweden has come under fierce scrutiny after he glued a 22-month-old child's eyes together. The youngster whose parents had initially checked him into a hospital after he sustained a gash on his forehead, ended up needing corrective surgery to counter the error. It is not yet known whether the physician who works at an emergency unit in Gothenburg, in western Sweden will face any investigation. Tearful: A doctor glued a 22-month-old toddler's eyes shut in Sweden . The parents who filed a report with Sweden's National Board of Health following the incident in December last year, said: 'There was glue over his entire eyelid and under his eye. 'This should never have happened.' The doctor had used a medical glue to treat the cut, but is alleged to have ignored the trickling of the substance down the child's face. That eventually resulted in the youngster being rushed into unnecessary surgery, which angered his parents. They added: 'A little cut resulted in sedation, surgery - with all the risks it entails, and hospitalization in the eye clinic.' Worryingly for Swedish authorities, this is the second time a doctor has committed the same mistake. The second case took place in Västerbotten in northern Sweden, just months earlier, when a 4-year-old  had an eye glued shut following treatment for a cut above the eyebrow. Chief physician at the local county council lamented the actions of the medic in question insisting; 'This can't happen. It's obviously awful for the child and the parents involved.' Neither child suffered any long-term damage, however more cases of a similar nature are now coming to light.",Incident reported just months after 4-year-old suffered a similar fate in ANOTHER Swedish hospital .
"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 2:30 PM on 10th January 2012 . A teenager who received a donor liver rescued from a plane crash has come face to face with the hero firefighter who ran into the burning jet to retrieve it. Kate Trevener, from Birmingham, was hours from death when a private Cessna carrying the organ from Belfast crashed at Birmingham Airport in thick fog. But firefighter Nick Jordan came to the rescue, freeing the pilot from the burning cockpit before returning to retrieve the donor organ. Destroyed: The Cessna on the runway at Birmingham Airport after the crash in November . My hero: Nick Jordan (left) met Kate (right) for the first time a year after he saved her liver from plane wreckage . Fashion student Kate was given a . chance to live when she had the life-saving operation at Queen Elizabeth . Hospital two days before her 18th birthday. And despite her body later rejecting . the organ, she remains determined to keep fighting her rare condition of . acute liver failure - and is now facing her THIRD transplant. Now more than a year after the runway crash, Kate and her family met Nick and the fire-fighting team at Birmingham Airport. Kate, now aged 19, told the Birmingham Mail: 'I’d been in contact with Nick on email but this was the first time I got to meet him in person which was great. It was really weird to go the airport, be shown round and be told what happened that day. 'I was desperately waiting for the transplant and my family had been told to say goodbye. It was quite overwhelming and emotional. 'But it was great to finally meet Nick and say thank you in person for what he did. He is a hero - without that liver I wouldn’t have had a chance to live.' Charred wreck: Miraculously, the liver was not harmed despite the Cessna being destroyed . Nick described the “surreal” moment he plucked the liver from the wreckage of the plane in November 2010. He said: 'Once everyone was out of the plane it was a case of get in there and have a look around. 'There was this box at the side, a picnic box. When I was told it was a donor liver I didn’t really comprehend the importance of it. I just picked it up.' Nick, aged 42 and a firefighter at Birmingham Airport for 11 years, first had contact with Kate when he was nominated for a Pride of Britain Award. He said: 'I’d never seen or spoken to Kate before, but I wanted her and her family to come and meet the watch. We showed her some of the pictures of the aircraft and said it was a miracle that anything survived. Her mum was sitting there telling us the story about when Kate’s liver started to fail and they were told to say their goodbyes. 'I just sat there and said, ‘You are calling us brave for rescuing a liver?’ We were just doing our jobs. 'I feel embarrassed being called brave when they have gone through that.' Kate Trevener is hoping to have a third liver transplant . Recalling the events leading up to the crash, Nick said: 'It was a clear day then the tannoy sounded a warning of low visibility. Suddenly it was like a wall of fog down the runway. 'Everything went completely white and then a couple of minutes later the alarm sounded indicating there had been an accident on the runway. 'We looked out and couldn’t see anything but above the fog appeared a plume of smoke. 'We drove down the runway as slowly as possible because we couldn’t see anything and we didn’t want to run anybody over. We couldn’t find the aircraft then saw flames flickering on the grass. We drove over and that’s where we saw the aircraft. 'We didn’t know how many people were on board or anything but the co-pilot was standing there. 'I asked, ""Is anybody else on board?"" and he said ""A donor"". He probably said a donor liver but I don’t remember. 'I asked if there was anybody else? He said, ""Yes the pilot,"" so that was the priority, to get him out. He came out first and then I ran back in for the liver. 'But it was just a job, I do what I’m paid to do.' Supportive: Kate Trevener pictured with parents Tracey and Mike and her sister Annabel earlier last year . Nick added: 'If ever people wanted to know about organ donation, they only have to look at Kate and her family, to know how important it is. They are the best advert. 'Kate’s mum wrote a thank you card to us all and her dad wrote a letter just to me. It was so moving, and at the end of it, he just said, ""From one dad to another, thanks for saving my daughter’s life"". 'There’s nothing more you can say to that.' Eight days after the transplant the liver died in Kate’s body, leaving her devastated family fearing the worst. But another donor was found and the brave teen underwent a second life-saving operation with an organ that also had to be flown in - despite that flight almost being cancelled due to snow. Yet that liver is now also failing and the battling teenager is now facing her third transplant. Kate said: 'Even though the first liver from the crash did not work, it kept me alive and gave me a chance to get this far.'","Rescued liver helped Kate survive for a year, but she now needs another organ ."
"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 12:43 PM on 15th January 2012 . Shame: Kimberley Hainey murdered her son Declan and concealed his death. She has been jailed for a minimum of 15 years . A woman who murdered her toddler son and left his body in a cot for so long it 'mummified' was today jailed for a minimum of 15 years. Kimberley Hainey, 37, was found guilty by a majority verdict last month of murdering her son Declan at a flat in Paisley, Renfrewshire. His decomposing body was found in a cot in March 2010 - eight months after he was last seen. Hainey was also convicted of failing to report Declan’s death to police or other authorities and of concealing his body at the flat. At the High Court in Glasgow, she was handed a life sentence and told she will spend a minimum of 15 years behind bars. Hainey was also sentenced to seven . years for attempting to defeat the ends of justice, which will run . concurrently with the 15 years. The court heard that the child’s body was partially 'mummified' when it was found on March 30, when he would have . been 23 months old. He was last seen alive in August 2009 and experts estimated he had been dead for up to eight months. Sentencing Hainey, Lord Woolman said: . 'Declan’s first birthday took place in April 2009, he appeared to have . all his life in front of him. 'He was surrounded by a loving family and people thought you were a loving mother. A few months later he was dead.' Lord Woolman said: 'You were Declan's . carer. You did not allow others to get close to him. Instead you . isolated him from your family, your neighbours, your friends and from . the welfare services. 'None of them thought that Declan's life was at risk. You engineered that situation. 'The jury convicted you of willfully . ill-treating and neglecting Declan, of failing to provide him with . adequate nourishment and fluids, of leaving him alone unattended for . excessive periods of time, and of failing to seek and provide medical . aid and care for him. 'In addition, you took significant . steps to cover up what happened. I take all these matters into account . in assessing the seriousness of the crime.' He added: 'You embarked on a . systematic and elaborate course of conduct to prevent people knowing, or . suspecting, that Declan was dead. 'It was a lengthy course of deceit that prevented proper inquiries being made.' He said that Declan's death had a 'devastating effect' on the family. In mitigation, he acknowledged that . Hainey had had difficulty with drink and drugs and that her son's death . was a 'huge tragedy' for her, as she said she loved the boy 'more than . anything in the world'. Hainey's defence counsel Edward Targowski QC said his client, a former heroin addict, denied killing the child. He said: 'As far as Miss Hainey is concerned, she is still adamant that she had no involvement in the death of her child. 'Her position is that she found . Declan dead in the morning, as she stated in her evidence, and her . actions afterwards in relation to the charge of attempting to pervert . the course of justice were as a consequence of that. 'That position is one that she has . held at consultation from the outset. She held it during evidence and it . is one she will continue to hold after the sentence.' Rubbish strewn cot: The bed where Declan Hainey was left dead for up to eight months is filled with waste including empty bottles of Irn-Bru, 3 Hammers cider, Lucozade, vodka and crisp packets. On the table are strewn cans of Tennents lager and more snack packaging, with more rubbish on the floor . The cause of Declan’s death is not known. Hainey pretended the child was being . cared for by family members or that he was at nursery, leading people to . believe he was still alive. Following the trial the Crown Office yesterday released photographs of rooms inside Hainey's  flat piled with rubbish. One shows what appears to be a travel . cot or playpen filled with empty plastic bottles and debris while . others show apparently mouldy milk bottles. Filthy: A dirty kitchen counter in the flat in Paisley, Renfrewshire, covered in unwashed dishes, empty containers including Clover margarine, Lurpak butter, a host of microwave meals, hamburger packaging and a bottle of pills . Squalid: A table in the living room is covered in dirty plates, cans of beer, Irn-Bru, shampoo bottles, a Pot Noodle container stuffed with cigarette butts, a curry house menu and even Christmas cards . The Crown is considering whether a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) should be held into his death. A report on the case was commissioned . by Tim Huntingford, the independent chairman of the Renfrewshire Child . Protection Committee (RCPC), on behalf of Renfrewshire Council and the . NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board. The RCPC oversees the services and . agencies which look after vulnerable children in the area and will . consider the report later this month before it goes to the appropriate . council policy board. Shocking: Bottles of rotten milk in various states of decay line up along the top of a radiator near Declan's cot . A number of changes recommended in the report have already been implemented in Renfrewshire. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont . has called for an inquiry into the death and said she was seeking a . meeting with the First Minister to explore how best to address the . 'scandal' of child abuse. A Scottish Government spokesman said: . 'The death of Declan Hainey was an appalling tragedy and these shocking . images simply underline the dreadful suffering he was forced to endure. 'The First Minister will consider any . request for a meeting and a decision on holding a Fatal Accident . Inquiry is a matter for the law officers. 'The Scottish Government is ensuring . protection is in place for all children at risk of neglect, and in 2010 . launched new National Child Protection guidance clearly outlining . expectations for local risk assessment procedures - including where . children are in potential danger from substance misuse issues.' Barely room to walk: Photos taken by investigators also show several empty vodka bottles, Dorito packets, clothes alongside a bag of nappies . Appalling: A remote control on a reclining sofa is swamped by a dirty duvet, beer cans, lighters, cigarette papers, tobacco, ashes, crisp packets and a half-eaten microwave meal . Evidence of a young life: Declan's bedroom with a wardrobe filled with a few of his tiny outfits with toys on top. Right, his barely used push chair surrounded by rubbish . Pitiful: Despite the squalor elsewhere, Declan's socks and slippers are arranged neatly beside toys and a fabric book on a shelf . Strathclyde Police detective inspector Maxine Martin said: 'I take no personal satisfaction from the sentence delivered to Kimberley Hainey today, although I am satisfied that justice has been served. 'This has been a very traumatic time for Declan's family and I sincerely hope that they can now try and move on with their life. 'Declan Hainey's death was a harrowing and tragic case. 'I doubt that anyone involved in the investigation or who has followed any of the media coverage of the case will have encountered anything quite as distressing. 'A team of highly-experienced detective and uniform officers worked on this inquiry. They were supported by some of the best forensic experts in the country.

A woman, who has given blood for 30 years, was stunned when she was turned away from a donor session because of a new safety ruling. Medical staff told Sarah Midwinter, 53, that they were no longer allowed to tap her arm to help bring her vein to the surface and she was forced to leave a facility setup at her local church. The incident has sparked concern that millions of people across the country will be deterred from donating at . temporary centres at a time when blood is desperately needed. Traditionally before a blood donation . takes place, the skin is wiped clean with sterile solution and then a . small area is tapped to raise the vein. But a new hygiene ruling states that the skin cannot be touched once it has been cleaned in case infection is spread. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) - . which manages national blood, tissue and organ donations - says this . procedure can now only be carried out in clinics where surgical gloves . can be worn by staff. Ms Midwinter from Bishops Nympton near South Molton, Devon, said: 'When I gave blood in the past the nurse would tap my arm to bring the vein to the surface. 'But when I went to give blood at the . local church I was told nurses were not allowed to touch my skin due to . a new hygiene rule. 'They said there was a danger of infection.' Ms Midwinter has the 'universal' O negative blood type and has donated 50 pints in her lifetime to help save lives. When she was told about the new rule in December she even offered to tap her arm . herself while wearing gloves and was willing to sign a waiver to allow . the nurse to do it for her - but her donation was still declined. The nurse revealed that at least five other donors had been turned away for the same reason that day. She added: 'It is crazy. It makes me very cross. This has never been an issue in the past and it seems ridiculous when . the NHS is always appealing for new donors. Experts recently predicted a 'dramatic' decline in donations because of major events like the London Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee . 'I want to see this rule scrapped. It will put people off giving blood. 'I'm . a keen horse rider and am always aware I could have an accident and . need blood. It is really important to donate and I've been doing it on . and off since I was 18. I'm upset that this silly rule is stopping . that.' It is only patients with thin veins, such as Ms Midwinter, that need their skin tapping and those with prominent veins are unaffected by the new regulation. Jo Tossell, NHSBT's director of . Infection Prevention and Control, said: 'As many of our sessions are in public venues we set a minimum acceptable standard of cleanliness. 'Clinically clean environments would be required for staff to routinely use sterile gloves for blood donation. 'The antiseptic solution used must be allowed to air dry completely after application to the donor's skin before the venepuncture. Once this has been done, the prepared area must not be touched with fingers before the needle is inserted. 'Providing that the clinical standards set by NHSBT are applied, we maintain the safety of our donors and the patients receiving blood - this is of paramount importance to maintain public confidence.' Experts recently predicted a 'dramatic' decline in donations because of major events like the London Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The NHS predicts approximately two million units of blood will be needed by hospitals throughout 2012, and the equivalent of 500 extra donations will be needed each week in the first six months to help them build blood stocks.","Sarah Midwinter, a donor of 30 .

'So it was a remarkable moment the first time we took a measurement from a distance of just 5 centimeters.' The 'star' was recreated in a high-energy facility usually used to simulate nuclear weapon detonations - which fires 26 million amps of current through a container of hydrogen to simulate the hellish 10,000-degree surface of a white dwarf star. The Z Machine is usually used to simulate nuclear weapon detonations, but 15 per cent of the high energy facility's time is devoted to experiments - including a simulation of the surface of a white dwarf star, created by firing a huge amount of electricity into hydrogen gas . The 'Z Machine' was built to simulate nuclear weapon detonations, but now devotes around 15 per cent of its time to experiments such as the star simulation, reports Inside Science. The machine produces huge amounts of energy - enough to melt diamonds. It has generated temperatures of 3.7 billion Kelvins, the highest ever created by humankind, including the centre of hydrogen bomb explosions. It also routinely generates electrical power equivalent to 80 times Earth's total power output. In the 'white dwarf' experiment, researchers simulated the 'spectrum' of a white dwarf's surface by firing 26 million amps of electricity through tungsten wires, which vapourises them, releasing X-rays. When the X-rays hit a container of hydrogen gas, it ionises and reaches a temperature of around 10,000 degrees centigrade, to recreate the conditions on the surface of a star. Winget's team have been experimenting with the Z Machine since 2010. 'Everyone assumes we know hydrogen so well,' Winget said. 'As it turns out, that's not the case.' When the Z Machine fires, 36 cables - each with the same girth as a horse's torso - fire simultaneously, triggered by laser switches. The cables, insulated by water, fire a pulse of 50 trillion watts into a target the size of a spool of thread. While the Z machine can generate an extraordinary pulse of energy, it only does so for a tiny fraction of a second - the power used is only enough to provide electricity for 100 houses for two minutes, and is supplied by the local electricity company via a wall socket.","Machine can output power equivalent to 80 times Earth's total consumption .

"Laurent Vallier and his children went missing from their home near last September . One skull found inside a suit case . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:53 PM on 16th January 2012 . Police in Cambodia believe they have found the bodies of a Frenchman and his four children who all went missing last year. A number of bones and skulls recovered from a car found dumped in a pond behind Laurent Vallier's home 45 miles away from the capital Phnom Penh are believed to be those of the Frenchman and his offspring. The 42-year-old, and his two sons and two daughters, disappeared from their home in Kompong Speu province in September and the French Embassy became involved in November. Remains: The skulls and bones of the Vallier family are gathered for the investigation . Destroyed: Officials clean a car to collect bones thought to be of Laurent Vallier and his children in Kompong Speu province . Victims: Laurent Vallier with three of his four children, whose bodies were all found in the pond . Mr Vallier’s father-in-law, 69-year-old Tith Chhuon, was at the scene yesterday and is believed to have identified his grandchildren as Johan, 11, Ramsey, 8, Sovan, 5, and Mickeal, 2. He confirmed that the family had been missing since at least September 8, when he went to visit them, only to find that they were nowhere to be found. He said: 'I filed a complaint with the French embassy and went to get information from the embassy six times. I just received the news on Saturday.' 'My son-in-law did not kill his kids and commit suicide. Someone killed them.' The embassy said in a statement it had been informed of the discovery of the remains but that, 'because of the state of the corpses, it is impossible to confirm that these are the bodies of Monsieur Vallier and his children'. Police said one skull had been found inside an open suitcase, having apparently floated in there after the car was submerged.

Police said one skull had been found inside an open suitcase, having apparently floated in there after the car was submerged. Relatives of Vallier's Cambodian wife, who died during childbirth, held a religious ceremony for the dead on Sunday. Neighbours were shocked to learn of the grim discovery. 'We just saw him taking his children to school every day and then they just disappeared. We thought they'd gone on holiday,' said Chuob Srey. Police would not comment further because of the preliminary stage of the inquiry. 'We . don't know whether this was a robbery or a murder. Just let our expert . team work on it,' said district Police Chief Touch Heang.

Mr Vallier married his wife in 2000 in Kandal province’s Kien Svay district before eventually settling in Kampong Speu in 2007. However she died in October, 2010, during the delivery of their youngest boy, Mickeal leaving Laurent as the sole carer for the four. According to local media, Mr Vallier worked as a tour guide, until his mysterious disappearance.","Laurent Vallier and his children went missing from their home near last September .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 4:25 PM on 3rd January 2012 . A £1.4 million government scheme to promote healthy eating on a budget has been slammed by nutritionists. The Change 4 Life initiative, which is backed by leading supermarkets and spearheaded by celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott, urges the nation to rustle up a range of dishes from chilli con carne to cheese turnovers. But, although they contain a low calorie content, experts are warning that many of the recipes use processed and unhealthy ingredients. The government's Change 4 Life campaign to promote healthy eating, which is spearheaded by Ainsley Harriott, has been slammed by nutritionists . One recipe in particular for cauliflower cheese, has raised concern as it advises people to use a packet sauce as a way of saving time. A packet of cheese sauce from the Co-op - one of the . participating supermarkets - reportedly contains 13 ingredients including cheese powder made from additives regularly used in processed foods, to extend shelf life. A serving of the sauce - which is meant to serve four people - has a high salt content and almost half the . government’s recommended daily allowance of saturated fat. Nutritionist Helen Money said it is positive that people are being encouraged to adopt healthier lifestyles, but she is 'disappointed' by many of the recipes featured . in the new campaign. The Change 4 Life initiative urges the nation to cook up a range of dishes from chilli con carne to cauliflower cheese . She told MailOnline: 'I would not advise my clients to eat the sauce as described. 'The campaign is trying to suggest quick easy meals for people to cook when they get home from work but there are much healthier meals that can be cooked quickly and easily.' She added: 'I also do not like the term supermeals and if using it at all, I would not classify meals such as this in it.' Meanwhile nutritional therapist Charlotte Watts, told the Metro: ‘This is a highly processed, denaturalised version of a meal that most people already make fresh from the ingriedients in their fridge. ‘Putting a healthy label on it is not just half baked, it is dangerous.’ Asda, CoOp and Aldi stores across the UK are offering discounts on a number of basics such as fruit, vegetables and fish as part of the campaign. Celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott has also helped devise a cookbook featuring a collection of healthy dishes that can be created for less than £5. Despite backing from national supporters shadow public health minister Diane Abbott also agreed the campaign is flawed. She said: 'They're calling this public health but it's just a glorified advertisement for big business.' However public health minister Anne Milton, unmoved by the criticism, said: 'The new year is a good time to think about losing weight. 'Some areas in inner cities are fresh food deserts so families fall into eating takeaway chicken and chips.' A Department of Health spokesperson also defended the choice of ingredients adding: 'The point of the campaign is to help families to make quick, healthy, inexpensive meals. 'Making meals from scratch can take time and be a bit more expensive. Sometimes shortcuts can help.'","Healthy eating initiative backed by leading supermarkets and celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott .

A chicken hatchery is being sued for alleged animal abuse - after undercover footage showed hatchlings being drowned in buckets of waste and hurled into rubbish bins. The gruesome film, taken at Cal-Cruz Hatcheries Inc in Santa Cruz, California, also shows young chicks, with ripped skins and organs hanging out, being trapped under machinery. Washington D.C.-based animal protection group Compassion Over Killing, represented by the Animal Legal Defence Fund, has filed a civil complaint with Santa Cruz Superior Court. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Scroll down for video... Injured: This chick, surrounded by fragments of egg shell, is shown struggling to move across the floor in the video . It follows, almost three years ago, the turning over of the footage to county Animal Services officials in February 2009. But, after an investigation, Santa Cruz District Attorney's Office did not file charges. The group wants an end to the alleged abuse at the firm, owned by Brian Collins, who is named in the suit but has not commented on the matter. Carter Dillard, litigation director for . ALDF which filed the lawsuit, told The Huffington Post: 'The systematic torture and reckless . neglect of baby birds at Cal-Cruz is not only shocking, it is also . illegal under the California Business and Professions Code.' And, in the lawsuit, the group stated: 'The investigation revealed that Cal-Cruz, through its employees, operates heavy machinery in a manner that regularly mutilates hatchlings, neglects dying birds trapped in machinery or on the concrete floor. Footage: Undercover video taken at Cal-Cruz Hatcheries shows young chicks being 'treated inhumanely', according to an animal protection group . 'It drowns baby birds in buckets of waste, throws hatchlings several feet into trash bins where they remain for several hours and abuses hatchlings with excessive force by washing them down a disposal chute with a high-powered hose. 'It also jams birds down the chute with a pole, and cruelly kills hatchlings in a crowded disposal chute in a manner that does not guarantee a humane death.' The lawsuit added that Cal-Cruz hatches and ships millions of chicks each year to growers who raise the birds until they are slaughtered. Shocking: In this segment of the video, a chick is shown drowning in a bucket . According to the statement, Cal-Cruz representatives said chicks are sent to Bauer Family Farms and Carlson Family Farms. And they are ultimately destined for meat counters at Northern California grocery stores. Dillard added: 'There is a hard reality when it comes to factory farming. If you look at the video, you see the numbers of animals involved - businesses have to maximise numbers so they try to minimise labour costs. 'The problem with factory farms is you cannot have those numbers of animals being cared for by so few people without a significant number of the animals literally falling through the cracks.' KGO-TV reported in 2010 that Cal-Cruz Hatchery president Brian Collins had viewed the video and confirmed it was taken in his facility. He told the San Francisco TV station: 'I think the employees get desensitised to the actual handling of the bird, and for them, it's a job.' He said he may make one change: 'Right now, the guideline is every 30 minutes you empty those boxes, I might make it 15 and be more diligent about it.' Leahy said the group has 'no reason to think the hatchery has made any significant changes.' The firm has 30 days to admit or deny the lawsuit's allegations.",Animal protection group files lawsuit against Cal-Cruz Hatcheries .

Nestled in the picture perfect Cotswolds, the parish of Woodchester is hardly the exotic location you might associate with such a beast. But, following the slaughter of a deer in the area and several apparent sightings, rumours are abounding that a big cat is stalking the fields and woods around the Gloucestershire village. Rick Minter, an expert on big cats in England, examined the carcass of the six-month-old roe deer in nearby Woodchester Park, yesterday. He said it showed ‘hallmarks of a big cat attack’, adding: ‘The claw and teeth impressions are indicative of big cat activity. Is this it? This image of a large black animal was captured in a field in north-west Wiltshire and could be the beast that is stalking a Gloucestershire village . Examination: A man completes a DNA test on the carcass of the deer. Experts said that the attack had the hallmarks of a big cat due to claw and teeth impressions . ‘And the stomach was taken out and discarded. Big cats are strict carnivores so they don’t want to eat the grass-filled intestines.’ The National Trust, which owns the land, is taking the theory so seriously it has ordered DNA tests on the deer’s remains to establish what killed it. Mr Minter said the team was also investigating paw prints near the carcass. He said: ‘There’s a saying with paw prints that “if it’s round it isn’t a hound” and these are quite round.’ Suspicion was raised further yesterday after a dog walker claimed to have seen a big cat in a field half a mile from where the deer was found on January 4. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was jet black and at least the size of a German Shepherd, very powerfully built and with large paws, a long tail and a smallish head.’ She is not the first to claim to have seen the ‘wild cat of Woodchester’ near the village, better known for being home to the largest Roman mosaic in Northern Europe. Wilf Ashman, 72,  said he had seen a big black cat nearby seven times in the past ten years, most recently in 2010. Mr Ashman said: ‘It’s not a normal feral cat, this is different and bigger.’ A large, panther-like animal has been pictured in fields just over the county border in north-west Wiltshire. Other recent sightings include a ‘pure white predator’ spotted in nearby Nailsworth, just weeks before the deer was killed. Andy Todd, who said he saw the beast, added: ‘It was pure white. It almost looked like a polar bear.’ The DNA tests are expected to be completed later this month.","Expert says attack had hallmarks of a big cat attack .

Alan Taylor, 59, was pronounced dead at his home on Sunday by paramedics after he suffered a cardiac arrest. Police were called and found the body of Richard Wight, 55, which had ‘physical injuries’, in his house next door. Essex Police were last night understood to be looking into the possibility that Mr Taylor attacked his neighbour before collapsing and dying. Discovery: Police have sealed off the scene in Braintree, Essex, after two bodies were found in neighbouring homes . He is thought to have endured years of harassment from Mr Wight. The lorry driver had a long history of terrorising neighbours in his street in Braintree, Essex. In 2008 he was jailed for eight weeks after going to Mr Taylor’s home twice on the same day and harassing him. He also spent seven months in custody . in 2002 while awaiting a court hearing for threatening another man in . the street with an axe. Officers found cannabis at his house when they arrested him. Ambulance workers confirmed they were . called yesterday to a report of a man suffering from a cardiac arrest . but when they arrived he was already dead. It was only then that paramedics were alerted to another body in the neighbouring property, believed to be Mr Wight. A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service, said: 'We were called at 4.48pm to an address in Eagle Lane, following reports a man was in cardiac arrest. 'One rapid response car and two managers were sent to the scene. The man was declared deceased at the scene and whilst there, we were made aware of another person who was also declared deceased at the scene.' 'Suspicious deaths': Neighbours said Alan Taylor, whose home is the light green property with a red Rover 25 parked in the driveway, would row with Richard White, who owned the adjoining brown cottage, over parking in the narrow lane . Today neighbours said Mr Wight would . ‘worry’ about leaving his van in the lane and often shouted at takeaway . drivers who blocked up the road. One neighbour, who didn’t want to be . named, said: ‘Something had been going on between the pair of them - we . said it looked like that had been rowing, it was as though they were at . war over something. ‘There was definitely tension there when I saw them.’ One former resident of the lane said: . ‘Richard did not have any family and I believe there was only one person . who used to come and visit him. ‘He was something of a loner and when . we lived there he would come out and shout at delivery drivers when they . dropped takeaways off. ‘Somebody bumped into his van once . down the lane and he put a big note in his window, stating the date and . time that the accident happened which me and my partner thought was . quite odd at the time. Evidence: The van thought to belong to Richard Wight being removed from the scene today . Driven away: A forensics officer removes the red Rover from the driveway of one of the deceased men for it to be examined . Emergency: Paramedics were called to the scene, but the man they attended to was already dead . Narrow: Police stand guard at Maple Lane's only entrance in Braintree, Essex . ‘He was always worrying about his van which was parked in the lane.’ An Essex Police spokesman said: ‘The deaths are being treated as suspicious and both scenes are being forensically examined. ‘The enquiry is focusing on the movements of the men or activity in Eagle Lane since January 1  2012. ‘Detectives from the Kent and Essex . Serious Crime Directorate are investigating these deaths thoroughly and . will be in a position to give more information when they have . established exactly what has happened at these two addresses.’ An East . of England Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: ‘We were called at 4.50pm . and sent two rapid response vehicles and two managers to the scene. ‘When we arrived we discovered one patient deceased although at that stage it was not known that there was another person. ‘Another body was found in a neighbouring property as we were leaving.’ Ambulance personnel stayed at the scene for more than two hours assisting police with their investigations.","Neighbours say two middle-aged men would often row over parking issues in the tiny lane in Braintree, Essex ."
"By . David Wilkes . Last updated at 11:34 PM on 3rd January 2012 . Commuters railed against inflation-busting fare rises yesterday, as  millions returned to  work amid train delays  and crammed rush- hour conditions. Hitting out at New Year price increases of up to 11 per cent, protesters handed out cards with a picture of David Cameron, Nick Clegg and George Osborne above the slogan: ‘Wanted for the Great Train Fares Robbery!’ One peeved London passenger held a banner carrying the message: ‘Merry Crisis and a Crappy New Fare.’ David Cameron was depicted as the Fat Controller today at St Pancras Station, London, where a jazz band played as commuters arrived on the day that fares rose by around six per cent . Online, many more vented their fury over the prospect of higher fares for a poor service. One . Twitter user wrote: ‘Paying more to stand on an hour-long trip outside . the toilets. You’re off your trolley Osborne! Wake up!’. Another added: ‘I’m paying £18 more for my rail fare to travel on overcrowded, dirty and late trains. Sort it chancellor!’ A third said: ‘UK train service is appalling. Trains always delayed. No seats. We’re all fed up!’ Rail passengers in Britain pay up to ten times more for their tickets than their European neighbours, figures have revealed. Critics say consumers are being ‘ripped off’ by an alliance of greedy train companies and tax-hungry Treasury ministers while passengers on the Continent pay significantly less for their journeys. A report by the Campaign for Better Transport shows British train passengers pay three-and-a-half times more than even the most expensive equivalent commuter journey of 21-24 miles highlighted on the other side of the Channel. It says a 2011 annual season ticket for the journey from Woking to London, including Tube travel in the capital, costs £3,268. Yet a similar 22-mile trip from Velletri to Rome costs Italian season ticket holders just £336.17 – nearly a tenth of the price. In France, a season ticket for the 24-mile trip from Ballancourt-sur-Essonne to Paris costs £924.66 – a third of the UK fare. Regulated fares, which include season tickets, have risen by an average of 6 per cent. However, some unlucky commuters are paying 10.6 per cent more for annual tickets than they did last January. The Campaign for Better Transport pressure group joined the TSSA transport union yesterday to protest against the increases outside St Pancras station in London. In addition to the union’s cards,  placards depicted the Prime Minister as the Fat Controller from Reverend W. Awdry’s Thomas The Tank Engine stories. Passengers leaving nearby King’s Cross station faced disrupted journeys on top of higher prices. Due to high winds, some . London-to-Scotland trains were starting and finishing in Newcastle upon . Tyne, while a series of signalling faults affected a number of rush-hour . services on other lines. Civil . servant Craig Marshall, 47, of Northwood, North-West London, paid £129 . for a one-way single ticket from King’s Cross to Edinburgh. ‘This is a lot more than I paid the last time I did this journey a few weeks ago, when I think it was something like £89,’ he said. ‘Passengers, once again, are paying for the failure of train companies.’ TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes said: ‘The £4,000 annual season ticket is now commonplace in the South-East. ‘By 2015, the £5,000 annual season ticket will be as well, thanks to ministers insisting on inflation plus an extra 3 per cent on top of that in 2013 and 2014.’ CBT campaigner Sophie Allain warned that fare rises ‘are starting to affect the UK’s competitiveness’.

"By . Craig Mackenzie and Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 5:14 PM on 17th January 2012 . Bullied: Amanda Cummings was picked on at school, according to her family . Claims that the Staten Island teenage girl who jumped in front of a bus to kill herself did so due to bullying are now being rebuffed by police. Amanda Cummings, 15, died over the holidays, and while some friends and family were certain that she was bullied, official investigators have ruled that out as the main factor in her suicide. Instead it is now thought that her tendancy to fall hard for boys, her history of depression, and an increase on her drinking and smoking, all converged to a tragic tipping point. 'No one had any previous signs of her being bullied,' a source close to the case told The New York Post. Though bullying may not have been a contributing factor to her suicidal mental state, it certainly reared its' ugly head after her death, as commentators made scathing jokes on a Facebook memorial page. One of the harshest messages, from Stephen Ephrem Green, played on her last name, saying: 'Bus was cummin’ Bitch was watchin’ Oh hurry Amanda Your bus cummin.' On December 27 at about 7:30pm, witnesses saw Amanda jump in front of an oncoming city bus. Hours before, she had posted to Facebook: '... Nd ill die tomight crying over you..' While the national problem of bullying- and the cruel Facebook postings post-mortum- may have had investigators initially looking into the tormentings of teenagers, other evidence points to personal problems as the biggest cause. She had been hospitalized in 2009 for cutting herself, but the doctor's notes make no mention of bullying ever being an issue. Her death came weeks after revealing posts appeared on her public Facebook page, in which she talked about 'feeling depressed' and asks 'what did I do to deserve this?' In one disturbing post on December 1 she said: 'I'll go kill myself'. Facebook abuse of Amanda: A sick poem from Steven Ephrem Green and a mocking image . Tribute page on Facebook to Amanda who jumped in front of bus clutching a suicide note . Taunting: Facebook users continue to harass Amanda Cummings' through the social media site even after her death . On December 6, in what appears to be a cry for help, Amanda posted on her Facebook: 'When i say im ok i want that one person t look me in the eye, hug me & say no ur not' Three days earlier, the natural blonde who recently dyed her hair black, said: 'Worst sat nite ever i cnt believe this is happening what did i do to deserve this.' She later talks about; 'mad people are turning against me :'( im spending this sat nite alone in my room crying'. Amanda herself did not even cite bullying in her extensive four-page suicide note. Instead, she sounded like a sad and love-lorn girl who had just broken up with a one-time flame. In the note, she confessed to being the reason behind her most recent romantic failing, saying that she was sorry for coming between her crush, Devon Rodriguez, and his suspected love interest Rebecca Natali. She finished the letter with the haunting words: 'I don't deserve to live!' Funeral: Mourners said an an emotional farewell to Amanda at a packed church in Staten Island .

The captain of the Costa Concordia said 'everything is much safer' on cruise ships than when the Titanic sank a century ago in a newspaper interview a year before the disaster. Francesco Schettino, 52, faces court action over the accident which left six people dead and a further 29 still missing. The captain told a journalist at the Czech paper Dnes that the risk of a modern disaster was much lower because of safety systems that had been put in place. Interview: Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, said in a newspaper interview that modern ships were easier to navigate . Sunk: A rescue boat and a helicopter patrol near the doomed cruise liner yesterday after it ran aground. Six people have been confirmed dead, 29 more are missing . But he added: 'I wouldn't like to be in the role of the captain of the Titanic, having to sail in an ocean of icebergs.' However, when pressed on the impact of the 1912 disaster and the long-term impact it had on shipping, he responded: Luckily, people forget about tragedies'. The £400million liner which crashed, with 4,200 passengers and crew, was sailing just 300 yards from the island’s rocky coast when it should have been at least four miles out to sea. Following the accident thousands have taken to Facebook to vent their fury at the so-called ‘Captain Coward’, who is now claimed to have ‘skimmed’ past the Tuscan isle of Giglio not just to salute a retired officer but also to impress his head waiter’s family on shore. After the collision there was allegedly a delay of more than 30 minutes before the coastguard knew about it. Captain: Francesco Schettino had skippered the ship for the past six years . The first the authorities heard of the accident was when they were alerted by passengers on the ship. Captain Schettino told the newspaper in his interview 13 months ago that the risk of a cruise ship accident was much reduced in the 21st century. 'These days, everything is much safer. It is easier to navigate thanks to modern technical instruments and the internet,' he said. 'If an error occurs, it is not so serious, because we are better prepared for possible complications. 'Using the internet we know straightaway the weather conditions and the situation that we'll find in the ports that we are heading to. And it's easy to take important decisions.' He added that he enjoyed the unpredictable and liked to face a challenge when in control of a cruise ship. 'I enjoy moments when something unpredictable happens, when you can diverge a bit from standard procedures. It's a challenge to face, I enjoy it,' he said. After swiftly escaping from the Concordia quickly after Friday's accident, Captain Schettino was arrested along with first officer Ciro Ambrosio. Clear-up: An oil removal ship is seen enar the Costa Concordia last night which ran aground off Giglio Island . Rescue teams search for missing people around the partially-submerged cruise ship in the harbour or the Isola del Giglio yesterday . Search: A helicopter hovers over the doomed cruise ship. The captain faces court action over the disaster . The captain was spotted wrapped in a blanket on his way to the shore at around 11.30pm – more than four hours before the evacuation of the vessel was completed and breaking the maritime tradition of remaining with his ship. Coastguards are said to have told him to ‘get back on board your vessel’ once they realised he was safe on the island but he failed to do so. Underwater search: A scuba diver swims next to the Costa Concordia in this photo released by the Italian Coastguard yesterday . In the December 2010 newspaper . interview he stressed that he was 'constantly vigilant' and said 'every . moment on a ship is important to me' and he had never been in a . dangerous situation. The . Daily Telegraph reported that he added: 'I think that's down to the . fact that I prepare myself every day of the voyage. I have to be . constantly vigilant. 'I believe that with thorough preparation we are able to keep any situation under control.' Captain Schettino has been skipper of the Costa Concordia for the last six years. He has a wife and a daughter. Abandon ship: Dancer James Thomas, 19, pictured next to the cruise liner, said the instruction to evacuate the vessel should have been made an hour earlier . Preventing pollution in the sea surrounding the sunken Costa Concordia will be a 'race against time', but the ship could be sailing again in future with a lot of hard work and a lot of money, according to a maritime expert. Malcolm Latarche, editor of IHS Fairplay Solutions, says that although the ship's tanks are in protected locations, there may be 'some small spillage' from the 17 tanks, which contain a total of 500,000 gallons of fuel, because of the current position of the cruise liner. He also says that while holidaymakers may not be rushing to book themselves a cabin on the luxury ship, it is possible that Concordia could be repaired and back in service some time in 2013. 'It would take an awful lot of work and a lot of money. It would be a year at least before it would be in a serviceable condition and the question is would anybody really want to go on it? 'Would you go on a ship that has been in that condition? Would you think it was unlucky or what? It'll always be a hard sell to get people to go on it, that's my opinion,' said Mr Latarche. He said that pollution was something the shipping industry dreaded the most. 'It is an issue, it's always an issue in these cases. It's what we in the industry hate to see because the pollution aspect of oil, and when you see oil tankers go aground, more than anything else, puts public opinion against the shipping industry,' he said. The maritime expert added: 'The longer it sits there...the waves are very very forceful. A powerful force is acting on the ship. 'A ship is designed to float, it's not designed to be sat on the bottom so while it's pushed about and prodded, and kicked around by the wind and waves, stresses will come on it and wells will crack.' However, he did add that although preventing pollution from a spillage would be hard work and 'not the easiest job in the world', it would not be 'rocket science'. The ship's operator, Costa Crociere, has enlisted Smit of Rotterdam, one of the world's biggest salvagers, to handle the removal of the 290-metre cruise liner. Yesterday he said on Italian television he did not understand why the ship had hit the rocks. 'Even though we were sailing along the coast with the tourist navigation system, I firmly believe the rocks weren't detected,' he said.'The ship wasn't heading forward but sideways as if under water there was this rock projection. 'I don't know if it was detected or not, but on the nautical chart it was marked just as water and some 100-150 metres (330ft-500ft) from the rocks, and we were about 300 metres from the shore, more or less. 'We shouldn't have had this contact.' A dancer who helped to direct petrified passengers off the ship said yesterday the instruction to abandon ship should have been given 'an hour earlier, if not more'. James Thomas, 19, had been working as an entertainer on the cruise liner for six months when it ran aground in the Mediterranean. He said: 'We started to lean to the port side... it got more and more dramatic and everyone seemed to know that it wasn't just a normal turn, we were turning unbelievably sharply. 'I was thrown out of bed and then as I stood there all my aftershave and a bottle of wine came towards me as I was catching things and smashed on my foot.' The teenager said an announcement over the ship's intercom system urged passengers to stay calm and assured them that there was simply a 'minor technical fault'. But a coded series of beeps was sounded to let crew know that there was a leak on board. Mr Thomas, from Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, said: 'We had an announcement saying please stay calm, everything is under control, it's just a minor technical fault. 'Then we had the coding of two short blasts followed by alternate tones which means there is a leak on board and so the crew were divided, very much so. 'A lot of people said, 'no just tell everyone to stay calm, that's what we've been told to say'. 'But then other people took the initiative and said, ""Okay, let's tell everyone to stay calm but hand over life jackets"".' Mr Thomas said he put on warm clothes and a life jacket before making his way to a pre-arranged meeting point, helping passengers along the way. He said: 'We thought it was a ""just in case"" scenario but then we started to lift and started to tilt and we knew something was deadly wrong. 'We knew we were going to have to do something drastic to get out of the situation we were in.'","Skipper Francesco Schettino told interviewer: 'I wouldn't like to be Captain of the Titanic'

She is pictured on ITV's Daybreak this morning . A teenager who escaped through a window as her shotgun-wielding stepfather blasted three of her close relatives to death has described the harrowing experience as like a 'nasty dream'. Laura McGoldrick, 19, said that Michael Atherton Snr aimed at her mother 'as if he was about to shoot a rabbit or a pheasant' before he opened fire. The taxi driver killed Susan McGoldrick, 47, as well was Laura's aunt, Alison Turnbull, 44, and cousin, Tanya Turnbull, 24, in Peterlee, County Durham, on New Year's Day before turning the gun on himself. Miss McGoldrick said she tried to shout a warning to her mother but she was unable to get the words out in time. The teenager, who was hit by the spray of the shot, fled before she even hit the floor. Relieving the moment her mother was killed, she told The Sun today: 'He walked into the house with the gun raised, aiming it at my mum's back. 'He had this focused, determined look as if he was about to shoot a rabbit or a pheasant. He definitely targeted my mum, he wanted her first. I wanted to get words out but my mouth wouldn't let me. It was like a nasty dream.' The weapon was one of several firearms Atherton held legally. During the attack, musical theatre student Miss McGoldrick managed to escape with her boyfriend Myren Grant, 19, through her bedroom window. Her stepbrother Michael, the 17-year-old son of Atherton, 42, and Mrs McGoldrick, also escaped. The teenager added: 'I am surprised he didn't run upstairs after me. I'm very lucky that I escaped. He would definitely have killed me if he had the chance.' Miss McGoldrick described Atherton as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character with 'seven personalities' and revealed he had been violent towards her mother on numerous occasions in the past. Injuries: Laura's facial wounds were still visible when she appeared on television this morning with Mavis Foster, left . She also called for a change in gun laws to stop similar incidents occurring. Durham Police said officers were called to Atherton's home four times between 2002 and 2004 because of domestic violence incidents. The force said he had 'a volatile relationship' with his partner and had split up repeatedly. They had been together 18 years but finally agreed to end their relationship for good days before Atherton opened fire. Shot dead: Laura's mother Susan McGoldrick, 47, who had been in a relationship with Atherton for the last 18 years, and her sister Alison Turnbull, 44 . She threw him out of the house last summer but he moved back in several weeks later after claiming he had a heart condition. Miss McGoldrick said that her stepfather was abusive and had once left her mother with a black eye after attacking her. An investigation is being carried out to work out why he was allowed to keep his weapons despite threatening to kill himself several years ago. He became interested in shooting around a decade ago after Bobby Turnbull, Laura's cousin, introduced him to it.

Steve Jobs described textbooks as an '$8 billion a year industry ripe for digital destruction', in conversations with his biographer Walter Isaacson. Apple looks set to unveil the weaponry it will use later this week, in a New York 'special event' that will have an education theme. Early reports by sites such as Ars Technica hint that Apple will unveil a textbook version of its Garageband music software - a 'book creation kit' that will make it easy for publishers, or teachers, to add video, music and images to text. Jobs himself had reportedly been in conversation with major textbook publishers such as Pearson before his death - and insiders say that the new Apple textbook software might be built around blueprints created by Jobs himself. Several textbook publishers are to attend the event this week. Bill Goodwyn, head of Discovery Inc's education department, said that he had talked to Apple about new approaches to the textbook industry. 'Apple is a very disruptive force, and in education, that's a good thing,' he said. Amazon already publishes many university-level textbooks via its Kindle eBook format - but many tech insiders say that Apple's ability to deliver textbooks mixed with video, pictures and music could be a critical advantage. Ars Technica reports that a 'book creation kit' is the most likely product to be unveiled this week, as Apple doesn't usually tend to go into publishing, regardless of what industries it works with. The site also claims that whatever plans are unveiled this Thursday, they could well be the brainchild of Apple founder Jobs himself. 'According to our sources close to his efforts, Jobs' personal involvement was perhaps more significant that even his biography purports,' says the site. 'Jobs worked on this project for several years, and our understanding is that the final outcome was slated to be announced in October 2011 in conjunction with the iPhone 4S. Those plans were postponed at the last minute, perhaps due to Jobs' imminent death.'","Insiders say Apple will unveil 'textbook creation kit'

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 7:36 AM on 16th January 2012 . One in every 17 people could soon be claiming a disability benefit designed for those who cannot walk or get around. Unless reforms proceed, the number being paid Disability Living Allowance will rise to 3.5million by 2015, according to Government forecasts seen by the Daily Mail. This is more than three times the 1.1million who received the benefit when it was created in 1992. It is now going to tens of thousands with drug and alcohol problems, asthma and unspecified back pain. Handouts: One in 17 Britons, some 3.5million people, could soon be claiming disability living allowance . The allowance, worth up to £125 a week, costs the taxpayer £12.6billion a year, almost the same as the Department for Transport’s entire £13billion budget. Ministers will set out plans in the House of Lords tomorrow to replace DLA with a new benefit, but their proposals are expected to run into significant opposition following a series of defeats over other welfare reforms last week. In a concession to disability groups, minister for disabled people Maria Miller will today agree to ditch plans to increase the period before claimants can qualify for a new disability benefit from three to six months. The change was designed to deter people with temporary health problems from going on to disability handouts. 'Poorly managed': Minister for disabled people Maria Miller hopes to reform social security for the disabled . But critics including Tory Mayor of . London Boris Johnson raised concerns that cancer patients might die . before they could get support. Ministers hope that maintaining the current three-month qualifying period for DLA will persuade sceptics in the Lords to back their plans. The figures seen by the Mail suggest that the vast majority of those on the benefit get it for life without even a face-to-face interview. Ministers say that under the current system, many can get DLA without any formal medical assessment, instead simply filling in a form. Some 71 per cent of claimants have no further check-ups to see if their condition has changed. Nick Clegg . Nick Clegg has triggered a Coalition row over welfare reform by demanding that the Government’s flagship ‘benefits cap’ is watered down. The Deputy Prime  Minister is also considering an amendment removing child benefit payments from the cap – which may encourage feckless parents to have more children. Plans for a benefits cap, unveiled in 2010, would ensure that no family will receive more than £26,000 a year in benefits – equal to average earnings. But under Mr Clegg’s proposals, tens of thousands of existing families, mainly in London, could be given years of ‘transitional relief’, or even exempted from the cap altogether. Lib Dems have sided with Labour and crossbench peers to defeat the Welfare Reform Bill, blowing a £2billion black hole in the Government’s spending plans. The Coalition plans to scrap DLA and replace it with a new benefit, called the Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Potential claimants will have a face-to-face interview and assessment before qualifying, followed by regular check-ups. PIP will reduce numbers of claimants aged between 16 and 64 by half a million, ministers will say. But the 340,000 most severely disabled people will get the higher rate of benefit. The proportion who will receive the higher rate will actually increase under the Government’s reforms. Mrs Miller told the Mail: ‘In the past, DLA has been poorly managed so we now have a situation where there are hundreds of millions of pounds of overpayments, and the vast majority of people get the benefit for life without systematic checks to see if their condition has changed. ‘We are replacing DLA with Personal Independence Payment and introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews – something missing under the current system. 'Under PIP, support will be focused on those who need it most, with a greater proportion getting the higher rates compared with DLA.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has pledged to slash £2.17billion from the vast annual bill for DLA by 2015. Nearly a million people have been on the benefit for 14 years or more. But cuts to DLA, which was designed to help people who have specific mobility or care needs, and cannot do tasks such as walking, washing or  dressing themselves, are under increasing criticism by charities and Opposition MPs. Department for Work and Pensions figures show that the mobility component of DLA is paid to 19,400 people with drug or alcohol problems, 30,900 people with asthma and 128,300 people with ‘unspecified’ back pain.",Disability Living Allowance costs £12.6bn a year .

But Christie Watson has just won one of the nation’s most prestigious literary prizes. The paediatric nurse, who began writing only five years ago, was last night given the £5,000 accolade for the best first novel by judges at the Costa Book Awards. Christie Watson, left, began writing while on maternity leave. Her first novel has now scooped a prestigious Costa book award . Her novel, Tiny Sunbirds Far Away, tells the story of a young Nigerian girl whose world is turned upside down by her father’s affair. The 35-year-old from south London has been a nurse since leaving home at 16 and training at Great Ormond Street Hospital. She began writing her novel while on maternity leave, and it was picked up by publisher Quercus. Miss Watson now goes head-to-head for the overall £30,000 prize with the four other category winners – including Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy who won the poetry category with The Bees. She said: ‘When I heard the news, I was totally shocked. It will take a few weeks for it to sink in. ‘I grew up on a council estate in Stevenage and we never had any money, although we were very happy. ‘I always wanted to write. I wrote poetry as a teenager but to actually write as a career was never a pathway that was on my horizon. ‘I feel astonished and very proud to have won – and to be next to people who I have long admired.’ Tiny Sunbirds Far Away was inspired by her Nigerian partner of 11 years, who is a doctor and still has family in the country. The tale of Blessing, the book’s protagonist, also examines the human impact of the political and social turmoil in the country. Despite her success, Miss Watson will continue nursing and still works in London hospitals part-time. She added: ‘The reasons why I got into nursing and writing are the same. 'It’s about the human condition – life, death, grief, loss. Both professions are interested in the same questions.’ The other winners are Andrew Miller, who scooped best novel for Pure, former opera singer Moira Young’s futuristic thriller, Blood Red Road, which took the children’s category and Matthew Hollis, whose Now All Roads Lead to France: The Last Years of Edward Thomas, won the biography category.

"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 12:10 PM on 16th January 2012 . David Cameron and Alex Salmond will meet within weeks for talks about holding a referendum on Scottish independence. The talks were revealed as opinion . surveys showed that support for a break up of the Union is higher in . England than it is north of the border. It is unclear whether the meeting will be held in London or Edinburgh. Talks: The Prime Minister, David Cameron, is set to meet Alex Salmond, . Scotland's First Minister, within weeks to discuss Scottish Independence . Yesterday two polls revealed . widespread English support for allowing Scotland to go its own way – and . hinted at a growing backlash against the country’s demands. An ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph . found that 43 per cent of voters in England want Scotland to become . independent, with only 32 per cent wanting the Scots to remain in the . UK. By comparison, 40 per cent of Scots . supported independence while 43 per cent want to retain the Union. A . Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday put support for independence at 26 . per cent in Scotland, against 29 per cent in England. The surveys are the first . comprehensive opinion polls in Scotland and England since David Cameron . decided to throw down the gauntlet to Alex Salmond. Conducted separately in England and . Wales by polling form Survation, the surveys apparently showed there is . more support in England for Scotland leaving the United KIngdom than . there is north of the border. Scots do not want the English to . meddle in whether they end their 300-year union with England, but . English voters are much keener to have a say in the matter. The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, dismissed suggestions English voters could have a say in any referendum on ending the Union . The Survation poll also suggests the English are less worried about Scotland abandoning links with England than are the Scots. The main worry of Scots appears to be that cutting their ties with England and Wales will leave them with less cash. More than four in ten Scots fear independence will leave them worse off financially. Fewer than one in four say they will gain. The collapse of the euro has done . little to swell enthusiasm for Mr Salmond’s nationalist cause. A massive . 79 per cent of Scots do not want to join the euro; 49 per cent don’t . even want to join the EU, with only 32 in favour, if they leave the UK. Scottish Secretary Michael Moore . yesterday dismissed the findings, claiming there was no demand from . English voters to be given a say in the Union’s future. But the results will underline fears . among some ministers that constant demands from Scotland are fuelling an . upsurge in English nationalism. A separate study yesterday by the IPPR . think-tank found four out of five voters in England believe Scots MPs . should be banned from voting on England-only matters, such as health, at . Westminster. Later this week ministers will launch . an inquiry into the so-called West Lothian Question about the voting . rights of Scottish MPs in the wake of devolution. Professor Richard Wyn Jones, . co-author of the IPPR report, warned that attempts to kick the issue . into the long grass may only fuel English resentment. He added: ‘We underestimate the current mood of the English electorate at our peril.’ The surveys came as the referendum row . intensified. Mr Salmond, Scotland’s First Minister, who has clashed . with the Prime Minister over the timing and nature of the referendum, . said Mr Cameron had rebuffed six requests for a meeting since the . summer. He added: ‘David Cameron has been behaving like Margaret Thatcher – perhaps he is “frit”, as she used to say.’ Mrs Thatcher memorably used the . Lincolnshire dialect word in a scathing 1983 Commons riposte to Labour . jibes that she was frightened of calling an election. Its use by Mr Salmond appeared to . sting No 10 into action with a spokesman saying the Prime Minister was . happy to hold talks with the SNP leader. He also urged Mr Salmond to meet the Scottish Secretary this week. Mr Moore said there was a need for . talks to resolve ‘real legal issues’ over the SNP’s plan to hold a poll . in 2014 offering Scottish voters an option of independence and/or more . powers devolved to Edinburgh. The Coalition wants a straight in/out . vote. Mr Salmond has said he will order police to refuse to man polling stations if Westminster forces a vote before 2014.","Opinion polls reveal English voters back Scottish independence more than the Scots .

Coup: George Osborne's deal with China will pour billions in the UK economy (pictured in Hong Kong today) British taxpayers face footing the bill for more rescue money for the International Monetary Fund if euro is to be prevented from derailing the world recovery. George Osborne admitted that there was a risk of the economy contracting if Europe suffered a deep downturn as forecasters suggest that the UK is already in recession. The chancellor said he would go to MPs for their approval if the IMF made a 'strong case' for more money. 'If I felt it was a decent request by . the IMF, then, of course, I would be willing to go to Parliament and . make that request,' he said. 'Britain . has always been prepared to provide the resources in the past and will . be willing to provide the resources in the future if there is a strong . case.' He also criticised the single currency zone leaders for doing too little to secure confidence. 'I think what the euro needs to do is show convincingly that it can . stand behind its currency,' he said, adding: 'We haven’t actually seen . much evidence of the pooled resources needed by the euro to actually . provide confidence to the market that they will stand behind their own . currency.' He was speaking at the start of a tour of the Far East where he announced plans to make London a key global trading centre in the Chinese currency. Far East markets fell slightly on opening today after the weekend downgrades of France and some other European economies. But there were rises in London and Europe, indicating the dealers expected the news. He predicted that high-tech and luxury exports from Britain to China would surge as the country grows. 'I think Britain can come into its own as providing the kind of things that a richer economy of consumers is more likely to need,' he said. In a speech to Hong Kong businessmen, Mr Osborne announced plans to develop London as the Western hub for trading in the Chinese currency, the renminbi. 'London is perfectly placed to act as a gateway for Asian banking and investment in Europe, and a bridge to the US,' Mr Osborne said. Huge achievement: The deal struck by the Chancellor in Hong Kong, pictured, will make London the biggest trading hub for Chinese currency outside China . 'It reflects London’s strength in . product development, its regulatory structure and the depth, breadth and . international reach of its financial markets. 'A richer, stronger Asia is an . opportunity for the world, not a threat — we should be bold enough to . say it and to explain it to our own populations.' Mr Osborne yesterday reaffirmed that . the Government would be prepared to make extra funding available to the . International Monetary Fund (IMF) alongside other G20 nations 'if there . is a strong case' but again stressed the cash must go to 'countries, not . currencies'. 'If I felt it . was a decent request by the IMF, then, of course, I would be willing to . go to Parliament and make that request,' he said. 'It wouldn't . ultimately be my decision, it would be a decision of Parliament. 'But . let me be very clear, I would not do that with Britain acting alone, . like other big G20 countries, and we are very clear this is not a . substitute for eurozone providing money for dealing with its own . currency.' His words come amid fresh warnings from two separate sources that the economy is in fact slowly edging back into recession. The . Ernst and Young Item Club warned the recovery is ‘paralysed’ by the . eurozone debt crisis and predicted growth of just 0.2 per cent this . year. Both the Ernst and . Young and the Centre for Economics and Business Research say that gross . domestic product shrank in the final quarter of last year and will fall . again in the first three months of 2012. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contracting output. The Chancellor made his symbolic turn . East in an attempt to show the Government is doing all it can to boost . growth, while chaos continues to reign in the eurozone. Speaking . during his visit, the Chancellor blamed little evidence of the 'pooled . resources' needed to instil confidence in the eurozone. In a speech to Chinese businessmen in Hong Kong he promised to throw open the doors of UK plc to Asian investors. Under . the agreement, the Chinese have agreed to keep their trading floors in . Hong Kong open for five hours longer so that trades in currency can . continue while financiers in London are at work. The . deal is a major vote of confidence in the City at a time when it has . been under attack from Britain’s European partners, particularly France, . seeking to curb its influence. Hours after this deal, which experts say will bring billions to the City, Mr Osborne sharpened his talons on the state of Europe and the Eurozone. Despite . pledging the UK would 'weather the storm' he said greater confidence . was needed in the Euro to put an end to unstable markets. He . said: 'I think what the euro needs to do is show convincingly that it . can stand behind its currency,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'We . haven't actually seen much evidence of the pooled resources needed by . the euro to actually provide confidence to the market that they will . stand by their own currency. 'There's . lots of good signs that they are getting there and there are various . summits planned for the next few months to ensure those resources are . there. 'But I think that is . what they need to do as well as resolve the Greek situation, I would . say almost more so than the downgrading. 'The ongoing uncertainty about how . they are going to write off some of the private sector debt in Greece is . an almost greater source of instability in the eurozone.' Mr Osborne said the most recent predictions by the Office for Budget Responsibility, which issues official forecasts, showed that Britain would have a negative quarter of growth but would not go into recession. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'That's their forecast, but they were the first to say that it is very uncertain and one of the biggest risks to the British economy is the further deterioration of the eurozone crisis. 'I said openly at the end of November to the House of Commons when I made my autumn statement that if the eurozone were to go into a deep recession, that would have a real impact on the British economy. Warnings: George Osborne said the eurozone needs to work harder to instill confidence it will stand by its own currency . 'I'm . confident the British Government is doing everything it can with a very . difficult inheritance, facing a very difficult international situation . to get Britain through this, to weather the storm.' Turning . to his deal with China the Chancellor said exports to the country from . Britain were up 'dramatically' over the last two years and demand for . services and high-technology products would only grow in the future. 'I think Britain can come into its own as providing the kind of things that a richer economy of consumers are more likely to need,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Osborne said 'enormous' Chinese savings meant there were opportunities for investment in British public infrastructure projects. He said: 'There a limit on how much the UK can borrow. 'But it is also the case that there's an enormous accumulation of Chinese savings and a lot of those savings have ended up in investments in government debt, particularly American government debt, US Treasury debt. 'I think those savings could be used in investing in British infrastructure, transport projects, energy projects and the like.' Coup: George Osborne's deal with China will pour billions in the UK economy . The UK is now the largest source of foreign direct investment to China from within the EU and UK goods exports to China rose by 20 per cent last year, and 40 per cent the year before that. Trade in the renminbi is growing rapidly. Ukip leader Nigel Farage blasted the Chancellor for being prepared to 'gamble' on offering more money to the IMF. He said: 'Once again the Chancellor uses this fudge phrase of 'countries not currencies', which will hardly fill the British public with confidence that the UK will not guarantee more British money to the IMF to support failing eurozone countries. 'The fact that the Chancellor is also prepared to go to Parliament in order to get support to offer more money should alarm us greatly. 'We are constantly told that the UK is broke, yet the Government seems prepared to gamble on offering more money to the IMF. This is something that British taxpayers will find hard to swallow.' While Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said the Chancellor was merely setting out the Government's position on a possible increase in UK funding for the IMF. 'He said if there were a strong case for additional resources, then he would be willing to take that case to Parliament,' said the spokesman. 'At the moment, there is a limit of £40 billion, of which £30 billion has already been subscribed. There is a headroom of £10 billion. If we went beyond that, we would require parliamentary approval. 'We have always said that we are supporters of the IMF and that the IMF should continue to play its traditional role of global backstop, providing stability to the world economy.' 'If the IMF believes it needs more resources, and there is a strong case for that, then the UK would play a role. That is a consistent UK Government position. We clearly benefit as a country from the IMF playing that role in supporting stability in the global economy.' Finance ministers of the G20 group of the world's biggest economies, including Mr Osborne, are expected to discuss the level of IMF resourcing when they meet in Mexico next month.end .

"By . Lydia Warren . Last updated at 8:36 PM on 17th January 2012 . She is famous for piling slabs of butter and glugs of cream into any - and every - recipe possible. But now Paula Deen has revealed that such a rich diet does not come without consequence - as she has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. The chef, 64, was diagnosed with the condition three years ago, but kept it quiet as she did not want to 'let diabetes stand in the way of enjoying my life', she told the Today Show. Scroll down for videos . Queen of Southern cuisine: Chef Paula Deen, whose signature dishes . include a bacon-doughnut-egg burger, has revealed she has Type 2 . diabetes . The condition, linked to obesity, is a result of genetic factors and lifestyle choices. It is a result of the body not producing enough insulin or failing to use it efficiently, allowing excess sugar to build up in the blood. It can be managed by making lifestyle changes, such as exercising more and lowering blood sugars by altering the diet. It might come as little surprise that the condition has affected a chef whose signature dishes include bacon, egg and a burger between a doughnut. And in an interview with the Today Show last year, the mother-of-two revealed she could never live without butter or her deep-fat fryer. But speaking about her diagnosis, the 'Queen of Southern cuisine' said people should take her recipes with a pinch of salt. 'I've always encouraged moderation,' she said. 'People see me cooking all these wonderful, Southern, . fattening recipes... it's for entertainment. People have to be . responsible.' Love of food: Deen has said the one food she could not live without is butter . Speaking with Al Roker, Deen revealed how she told Oprah Winfrey to exercise the same sort of responsibility. 'Like I told Oprah, ""Honey, I'm your cook, not your doctor,""' she said. 'You have to be responsible.' Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too much glucose, a type of sugar, in the blood. It is often associated with obesity. In those with the condition, the body is unable to break down glucose into energy as there is either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or because the insulin that is there does not work properly. The symptoms, such as tiredness and weight loss, can be controlled by eating a healthy diet and monitoring the blood glucose level. Insulin medication, usually in the form of tablets, also controls the condition. Around 25 million in the United States have diabetes, with around 90 per cent having Type 2. When asked if her high-fat recipes can lead to diabetes, she said: 'That is part of the puzzle.' She added that there are other factors, including genetics, lifestyle, stress and age. To deal with the condition, she is 'making lifestyle adjustments, including lightened-up versions of her favorite recipes'. The Food Network chef is also taking Victoza, a once-daily, non-insulin injection. 'I am here today to let the world know that it is not a death sentence,' she added. Although it was rumoured Deen had the condition in April 2010, this is the first time she has confirmed it. In 2010, Deen earned just under $10 million from her television shows, recipe books, endorsements, retail sales and speaking fees, based on figures by New York Magazine. It suggests she could have earned around $30 million in the time since she was diagnosed. Type 2 diabetes is an ever-growing problem in the U.S., with around 20 million people suffering from the condition. Some of Deen's peers have questioned her judgement in keeping her own diagnosis quiet. Signature dish: One of Deen's recipes is a Lady's Brunch Burger that features doughnuts in place of buns, bacon, a beef burger and a fried egg . Fellow chef Anthony Bourdain told Eater.com: 'When your signature dish is hamburger . in between a doughnut, and you've been cheerfully selling this stuff . knowing all along that you've got type 2 diabetes, it's bad . taste if nothing else.' According to the People magazine, Paula is said to be under doctor's orders to steer clear of high-calorie foods. Leading endocrinologist Dr Daniel Lorber . said: 'Diabetes can be deadly because it increases your risk of heart . disease, kidney failure and stroke. 'And Type 2 diabetes can be directly related to obesity, which is reaching epidemic proportions in this country.' A family friend told the Enquirer: 'When Paula was diagnosed with diabetes I think she was worried that if her secret got out, it would make her look like a hypocrite. 'Ironically, the very thing that made her rich and famous turned her into a poster child for what could happen if you follow in her footsteps.'

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 10:58 AM on 17th January 2012 . A young mother whose father killed himself two days before he was due to stand trial for her murder was found dead by a group of children, an inquest heard. The skull of Victoria Couchman, 19, were found by the youngsters in woodland in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, five months after she had disappeared. But despite being missing for so long, none of her friends or family had reported her missing. Yesterday a coroner ruled that she had been unlawfully killed. 'Unlawfully killed': Victoria Couchman, 19, was found dead in woodland by a group of children, the inquest heard . Police found more human remains nearby including her femur and pelvis after the children stumbled across her skull in October 2008. The single mother's father Tony Couchman, 46, killed himself in his prison cell just before he was due to stand trial at Lewes Crown Court, the inquest in Hastings was told. East Sussex coroner Alan Craze said it was 'one of the most significant and difficult' cases he had dealt with. Accused: Tony Couchman, 46, was due to stand trial charged with murdering his daughter . The murder case against her father Tony was 'circumstantial', the coroner was told. As the single mother's remains had been left exposed for several months a cause of death could not be determined - although the pathologist said she may have been strangled. But Detective Chief Inspector Adam Hibbert, from Sussex Police’s major crime branch, said that 'taken cumulatively' there was 'good reason' for Couchman to be charged and to stand trial. The inquest heard that Couchman was suspected to have sent text messages purporting to be from his daughter after she had been killed. These included texts sent to her mother, Fiona Masters, with whom Couchman had split, saying she had set up home with a new boyfriend. Mr Hibbert said: 'A text expert examined the texts purporting to be sent by Victoria. He came to the view that it was very likely that the texts were sent by Tony.' A phone used to send texts claiming to be from Ms Couchman had been bought by a man fitting her father’s description at a shop. A walking stick was also bought, which Couchman had cause to use. Other reasons to suspect she had been killed included the fact that her body had possibly been concealed, and that she had not taken any money or possessions with her. There was also no contact with friends or family, including her own daughter, and there were 'lies and inconsistencies' in Couchman’s accounts to police, Mr Hibbert said. Murder scene: The remains of Ms Couchman were discovered by children in woodland in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex . Couchman had told police that he had not reported her missing because she had vanished on previous occasions and was on a final warning with social services. He claimed to fear that social services would take away his grandchild but the authorities denied to police that she had been given a 'final warning'. According to Mr Hibbert, Couchman had 11 convictions ranging from theft to firearms offences. At around the time of her disappearance, Ms Couchman was seen outside the house she shared with her father in St Leonards, and was heard to say: 'I have had enough. He’s too controlling.' Later that day, a neighbour called at her home and was told by Couchman that she had gone out. Mr Hibbert said the prosecution would have said at trial that Couchman had disposed of her body in his car, which he sold 12 days later. He also said he had lost his mobile phone shortly after she disappeared, which police said would have been of important evidential value. Linda Piper, deputy general manager of surgery at the Conquest Hospital in St Leonards-on-Sea, said that Ms Couchman had surgery following a car crash in which her brother Dean, 17, died in November 2005. This resulted in her being fitted with pins and screws with a unique reference number which helped identify her, along with dental records.","Victoria Couchman's father Tony, 46, was charged with murder but he killed himself before standing trial .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 1:33 PM on 17th January 2012 . A raft of high-street promotions in the run-up to Christmas triggered the largest drop in inflation in nearly three years. Consumer prices index inflation dropped to 4.2 per cent in December from 4.8 per cent in November, according to the Office for National Statistics. This was equal to the decline between March and April 2009. The drop was driven by a 2.8 per cent fall in the price of clothing and footwear as retailers slashed prices in the run-up to Christmas. But there was less evidence than expected of the impact of the supermarket price war which started in early October, as food prices rose by 1.4 per cent month on month. The UK rate of inflation has begun to fall off in recent months after rising more than 2 per cent in less than two years . The drop in the rate of inflation in December shows the pressure on households is easing after a sustained period of high prices and slow wage growth. The ONS said downward pressure also came from . fuel prices, which dropped 0.6 per cent, and alcoholic drinks, which fell 1.5 per cent . between November and December. The rate is still more than double the 2 . per cent target set for the Bank of England by the Government, but the . Bank has insisted inflation would drop steadily from its peak of 5.2 per . cent in September. The Bank of England, in its last inflation report in November, said that it expected the rate of inflation to fall back gradually through 2012 before possibly undershooting the Government's 2 per cent target next year. The increase in the cost of living is . expected to slow further as the economy grinds to a halt and . unemployment soars towards the three million mark. Aggressive High Street cost-cutting in the run up to Christmas has helped force down inflation . December's figures and any further slowdown in inflation will support the argument in favour of holding interest rates at record lows of 0.5 per cent and injecting billions of pounds into the Bank's quantitative easing programme. Looking ahead, Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial information services company Markit, said: 'Further falls are likely in coming months, reducing the squeeze on incomes seen last year and therefore providing a much needed boost to economic growth in 2012.' The fall in clothing prices was driven by a wide range of garments, with a particularly large drop in women's outerwear, the ONS said. The retail sector has been one of the . most visible victims of last year's consumer spending squeeze as a . string of businesses closed stores or fell into administration. High Street sales of clothing and footwear were a key contributor to the change in CPI . Moderating prices on the High . Street and at the supermarket has helped forced down inflation . There was some upward pressure last month with the largest price increases coming from mobile phone charges, rising 1.3 per cent. Elsewhere, . alternative measures of inflation also fell, with the retail prices . index (RPI) dropping from 5.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics, said today's figures paved the way for a further increase in QE next month. The Retail Prices Index fell to 4.8 per cent in December . She . said: 'Obviously these falls in inflation will help to alleviate the . squeeze on households' real pay - but the deteriorating labour market . and tightening credit conditions will maintain the downward pressure on . consumer spending this year.' Victoria Cadman at Investec said: 'Evidence for December to date suggests that it has been another month of heavy discounting on the high street, helping to keep a hold on clothing and other goods price inflation.' Earlier this month, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said shop price inflation fell to 1.7 per cent in December down from 2 per cent in November - its lowest level for 16 months. Coming down: The cost of petrol fell by 1.1p per litre between November and December . The rate of inflation for non-food items was at a two-year low of 0.3 per cent, and significantly down on 0.8 per cent in the previous month. This was driven by price cuts on electrical items, clothes and footwear, with many items cheaper than they were a year ago. However, the BRC said food prices rose 4.2 per cent, which was slightly higher than November's 4 per cent increase, despite the high level of supermarket discounts. The finding was a surprise as the big players had been embroiled in a price war after Tesco announced a £500 million price-cutting campaign. Asda guaranteed to be 10 per cent cheaper than its rivals and Sainsbury's launched its own brand price-matching scheme. The downward trend for headline inflation is set to continue in January, which will be the first month that the figures will not be pushed up by last year's hike in VAT to 20 per cent. Utility tariff cuts announced this week will also help bring inflation down in coming months.","The Consumer Prices Index inflation fell to 4.2% in December from 4.8% in November .

The pilot of the plane that severely injured Lauren Scruggs said he tried to warn her before she walked into the propeller, costing the model her left hand and her left eye. Curt Richmond revealed to air safety officials that he put his arm up and yelled at the 23-year-old as she tried to walk in front of the plane December 3 at Aero County Airport in McKinney, Texas. Mr Richmond, who has not spoken publicly about the accident, said the plane's engine was still running and he told the young woman to walk behind the plane and out of harm's way. Warning: Curt Richmond, the pilot right,, said he tried to warn Lauren, left . Debut: Lauren Scruggs made her first debut outside her Texas hospital this week after mistakenly walking into a spinning propeller early last December . Mr Richmond put down his arm and turned away from Lauren when he thought she had turned to walk away from the spinning propeller, according to a report from the National Transportation Safety Board. But it's unclear whether Lauren heard his warning over the roar of the engine. Moments later, someone on the ground screamed 'Stop! Stop!' and Mr Richmond saw Lauren laying on the tarmac. He immediately cut the engine. Investigators say she walked into the whirling propeller blades on the front of the plane after a 30-minute plane ride to look at Christmas lights from the sky. Statement: Mr Richmond has not spoken publicly about the accident but revealed the story to investigators . Lauren had been riding in an Aviat A1-B Husky (like the one pictured) when the accident occurred . Mr Richmond had left the engine running while new passengers filed into the small plane as he prepared another trip to the skies. The NTSB did not find fault with the pilot for the accident but at least one aviation expert said Mr Richmond is ultimately responsible. 'The bottom line is, he should have shut the engine down,' air safety investigator Denny Kelly told MSNBC.com. 'The bottom line is, he made a mistake.' Website: Lauren is thought to have written a heart-felt message of gratitude on her Lolo website . Lauren, who has been recovering in . hospital since the accident, wrote on the LoLo magazine website for the . first time earlier this month. She said: 'I don’t know how to thank each one of . you, properly, for so much love during this difficult incident in my . life. My heart is so grateful beyond what I could ever . imagine. 'So thank you dearly for the sweet encouragements, the precious . words in letters and messages, the beautiful grace in pretty presents, . but mostly I am so so thankful for you and your loving hearts and sweet . spirits.' Lauren, a communications graduate who . is known to her friends as Lo, had just gotten off of the plane after . viewing Christmas lights from above Dallas when the tragedy struck. She has been in intense rehabilitation ever since. Her Twitter account is also active . again but it is not clear whether or not it is Lauren herself writing . the posts, though family spokeswoman Janne Harrell told ABC that the 23-year-old . has had her iPhone out frequently during hospital visits. The post was . signed, 'love, lo'. The model made her . first trip outside the hospital last week, taking a break from her four-and-a-half weeks of intense rehab. Her mother, who has updated her daughter's progress on the CaringBridge account wrote of their visit to Whole Foods: 'We . had many complete strangers stop us, with tears in their eyes, saying . they have been praying for Lo and for our family.' Appreciation: Lauren's mother (far right) has been routinely blogging on her daughter's recovery which includes continuous thanks by their entire family for her recovery . She recently posted that her daughter . is adjusting to her new life and that simple tasks such as 'typing an . email' are heightened. 'Many have told us how the accident . has them seriously thinking about how important God needs to be in their . lives, or how it has helped them refocus where they have gotten off . track in their spiritual walk,' Mrs Scruggs wrote. In . addition to losing her hand and eye to the two-seater plane at a Dallas . airport on December 3, Ms Scruggs suffered from brain injuries and . scaring to half of her face. Doctors removed her left eye on December 15 and since then she has been in intensive therapy to relearn how to walk, talk, use a stationary bike and even dress herself. Friends, family and members of the community have so far raised $10,000 to help with her medical bills. A list: Lauren Scruggs (right) attends a fashion party in New York with actress Chloe Sevigny (centre) and a friend . Most recently Ms Scruggs' twin sister Brittany Morgan reported feeling her sister's pain, literally in her own left eye. 'Being . twins, and having a bond that most never understand, Britt's left eye . has been twitching for the last 4-5 days every 30 seconds or so,' their . mother wrote late last month. 'She knows it's because of the deep . connection she and Lo have, and God allowing her to go through this with . her at the ‘twin’ level.' In the build up to the holiday, her mother reported her daughter/stylist and fashion blogger's further strides in her recovery. She managed to cook scrambled eggs, dress herself, brush her teeth and her hair and take a shower without help, her mother wrote on the webpage. 'Lo is making remarkable strides!' her mother, Mrs Scruggs, wrote. 'Her spirit is incredible. She's positive, hungry and cheery!

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 5:13 PM on 16th January 2012 . A ten-year-old blighted by blood cancer has been given new hope, after a one-in-a-million bone marrow donor match was found in Germany. Lewis Dyche was diagnosed with leukaemia 18-months ago, after experiencing breathlessness, tiredness and loss of appetite. Following chemotherapy doctors gave him the all clear last January but months later the disease returned and he was told that he urgently needed a stem cell transplant. New hope: Nine-year-old cancer patient Lewis Dyche with mother Sharon, sister Amelia and father Mark . In a desperate attempt to find a donor his family teamed up with a local charity to organise a recruitment drive in Derby. Lewis's 16-year-old sister Amelia, was also tested - siblings stand a 25 per cent chance of being a . match - but the results were negative. Now after a near global search, scouring registers in the UK and abroad, experts located a perfect donor match in Germany and a bone marrow transplant is scheduled for February 16. His mother Sharon, 46, from . Chaddesden, Derbyshire, said: 'I feel a lot more positive now that we know . it’s definitely going ahead. 'I felt excited when they told me, but . I’m apprehensive at the same time. 'At least we’ll be going in the . right direction. As parents, we want a 100 per cent chance. But, failing that, . we’ll take whatever we can get.' A picture of Lewis before the blood cancer struck . Lewis was diagnosed with leukaemia in June 2010 and treated at . Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre, which has a specialist children’s . cancer ward for youngsters from across the region. In the first few months after . diagnosis he had chemotherapy and was well enough to go back to school between treatments. Then, in January 2011, he was found . to be clear of cancer but medics warned there was a high chance of the . illness returning. He suffered a relapse in August and has since been given . more chemotherapy using stronger drugs. He was even in hospital over Christmas but was well enough to return home on New Year’s Eve to celebrate his tenth birthday. The donor has been identified by experts . at Sheffield Children’s Hospital, who will carry out the transplant next month. The procedure, which takes around one hour to complete and several days of preparation, has around a 60 per cent success rate. His mother added: 'We’re not looking forward to seeing him . so ill. We’ve got our hopes up about the transplant but, at the same . time, we’re nervous because it will be so tough. 'It’s not just a case of having a transplant and there you go, you’re cured. 'The reality is that there’s a long road ahead, so we’re not celebrating.' During the transplant the donor's blood will be removed through a vein in one arm, passed through a machine to separate the stem cells from other cells, and returned to the body through another vein. The aim is be to harvest healthy stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow, and create three important types of blood cells. The new stem cells will be given to Lewis and take over the production of his blood cells. Sharon added: 'Once Lewis goes to Sheffield, the first thing will be to give him five to seven days of chemotherapy, plus other drugs. 'Then he’ll have the transplant, which will take a couple of hours, and then he could be in hospital for up to six weeks while he recovers.' After Lewis goes home, he will need regular tests and will have to be home-educated for several months to avoid any risk of infection as his immune system will be lowered. In England and Wales, an estimated 2,700 new cases of leukaemia are diagnosed each year. It was reported last year that in UK alone there were 1,600 people waiting for a bone marrow transfusion - out of a total 37,000 worldwide - and only half would find a suitable match.","Lewis Dyche diagnosed with leukaemia 18-months ago .

The card is on display at this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and the technology is currently under trial by Citibank. The card's number changes every time it's used - so it's near-impossible to clone with current technology. Online shoppers simply enter a PIN to 'turn on' the card, and it generates a new number which is displayed on the front - this can then be typed in to websites safely . The code stored in the magnetic strip changes every time it's used - so it's very difficult to clone. You 'tell' the card to switch on by entering a PIN code, and it displays the number. Without the code, it's useless. The card is the size of an ordinary credit or debit card, and the battery inside lasts for three years. Dynamics Inc, the company behind the cards, says that its 'powered cards' can also be used for cards that offer access to several accounts from one card, or cards that hide a portion of the number unless a PIN is entered. 'All that is needed to steal a credit card number today is a pen and paper or a portable card reader,' says maker Dynamics Inc, which showed off the card at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week.'The credit card automatically writes a new, unique dynamic security code onto its magnetic strip for every purchase. A display can also be added to the card - thus replacing the three or four digit security code physically printed on traditional cards.' When the card is 'off', the magnetic strip doesn't store the correct number - so thieves can't 'skim' a card in a restaurant.","Security code changes every time it's used .

"By . Jennifer Madison . Last updated at 8:06 PM on 18th January 2012 . A high school cheerleader who says she woke up from a nap stricken with Tourette's-like symptoms is speaking out for the first time - and demanding answers from the New York State Department of Health. Seventeen-year-old Thera Sanchez, appearing with her friend, Katie Krautwurst, 16, on NBC's Today Show, said she started the school year off like any other. But her life dramatically changed the evening of October 7. The teenagers are among 12 girls at LeRoy Junior-Senior High School suffering suddenly from a mysterious disorder, which causes them to shake and tic uncontrollably. Doctors today said the outbreak of Tourette's was most likely caused by a rare 'conversion disorder' otherwise known as mass hysteria. Scroll down for video . Medical mystery: Thera Sanchez, 17, said she and 11 other girls at LeRoy Junior-Senior High School in upstate New York are suffering similar symptoms . Although the disorder is psychological, Dr Laszlo Mechtler told the Today show that the symptoms are real - but will fade with time. Conversion disorder can occur after a stressful and event and often also include numbness or blindess - but the exact cause is not known. The girls and their mothers appeared on the programme, insisting the state Department of Health isn't giving them clear answers. Their daughters, close friends, described how their active school lives have been completely crippled by . the onset of symptoms, including stuttering and verbal outbursts. 'I used to cheer every day,' Miss Sanchez said. 'I used to go to two art classes every day. Now I'm not in school.' Those things she says now are nearly impossible. 'I'm very angry, I'm very frustrated, no one's giving answers,' she continued. Miss Krautwurst shares her . frustration, and she said her family has not received any testing data . from the school or the Department of Health explaining how 12 girls at . the the same school were suddenly stricken with similar symptoms. Bright future: Miss Sanchez said she was on her high school cheer squad and on the honour roll before she woke up on October 7 stuttering . Frustrated: Katie Krautwurst, 16, is one of the 12 girls suffering sudden uncontrollable outbursts and tics . Concerned: (From L-R) Beth Miller, her daughter, Katie Krautwurst, and Melissa Philips, with her daughter, Thera, demanded answers on the Today Show . 'I'm angry too,' she said. 'I can't explain it. They told us it . was traumatic. But I don't really think any of us had that traumatic of a . life before and that it would randomly happen.' Miss Sanchez's mother, Melissa Philips, said she is not satisfied with what the doctors or school administrators have told her. 'When these started, I was fine. I was perfectly fine. I felt good about everything, I was on honour roll. There was nothing going wrong. And then I just woke up and that's when the stuttering started.' - Thera Sanchez, 17 . 'Nothing's been collectively done for . our daughters. Everything's been done individually. Testing that they . say all of the girls have had, they have not had. The facts that they're . stating just are not true,' she said. Miss Sanchez and Miss Krautwurst are each getting private treatment from their doctors. And while Miss Krautwurst says her . symptoms have improved, they want more answers from the New York . Department of Health, which says each student was examined and given a . diagnoses. A spokesman for the agency told Fox . News the investigation did not reveal environmental or infectious causes . as the origin of the girls' illness. Miss Sanchez told Ann Curry on the Today Show she was told her condition was stress-induced. But she denied feeling extreme stress on the onset. 'When these started, I was fine. I . was perfectly fine,' she said, referring to her verbal outbursts. 'I . felt good about everything, I was on honour roll. There was nothing . going wrong. And then I just woke up and that's when the stuttering . started.' Questions linger: An investigation by the NYS Department of Health did not reveal environmental or infectious causes at LeRoy High School as the origin . Expert: Dr Greg Young, with the NYS Department of Health, said he is unable to disclose what the cause of the symptoms are due to privacy laws . Unlike Katie, she said her condition has since gotten worse. School administrators have insisted . it is not a case of mass hysteria and that none of the girls are making . the illness or symptoms up. Tourette's syndrome affects the . body's brain and nervous system by causing tics - repeated, . uncontrollable movements or involuntary vocal sounds. Last week, the school held a forum . for concerned parents. About 150 people attended, demanding to know what . was wrong with the students. 'I can't explain it. They told us it . was traumatic. But I don't really think any of us had that traumatic of a . life before and that it would randomly happen.' - Katie Krautwurst,16 . Dr Greg Young, with the NYS . Department of Health, said: 'I can assure you these children have all . been seen by professionals that have come up with answers and they are . all being treated and they're actually doing pretty well.' He revealed that tics like this can . be caused by a number of factors such as genetics, head trauma, drugs . for ADHD and OCD and antihistamines. Through tests over the last few . months, they have been able to rule out a number of environmental . factors, infections, illegal drugs and carbon monoxide poisoning. WGRZ.com reported the Centers for . Disease Control in Atlanta has been consulted, along with Columbia . University, as well as the Genesee County Health Department and the New . York State Health Department. Dr Young assured parents that these cases have been seen nationwide and they come and go in individuals. He said that stress and anxiety can make them worse. But most parents were left frustrated . due to HIPAA (federal health privacy laws) which meant the doctors were . limited in telling them what was causing the symptoms. Because of this and the limited . number of cases in the small community, Dr Young said their hands were . tied as they cannot comment on children's diagnosis. He said some of the students were already showing signs of improvement. Watch video here .","Federal privacy laws prevent school, NYS Department of Health from disclosing cause of illness .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 5:52 PM on 16th January 2012 . Under fire: Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt faces closer scrutiny from anti-trust politicians considering whether the company has a monopoly . The American Federal Trade Commission has expanded its probe into Google to look at Google's Plus network, in an investigation into whether Google 'cooks' search results to favour its own products, a source said on Friday. Google+, which was launched in June, is similar to Facebook and Twitter. A new version of Google search - called Plus Your World - caused protests last week after it mixed photos and posts  from Plus into Google searches. It means, for . instance, that if your search term included the name of your dog, then . images of your dog from your social network sites would appear in your . search results. However, . the social networking aspect only applies to users of Google Plus, the . company's own social networking site, leaving the likes of Twitter and . Facebook out in the cold. Twitter described the move as 'warped'. Bloomberg earlier on Friday reported the expansion of the Google probe, citing two people familiar with the situation. A Google spokesman, however, said that the Federal Trade Commission had not asked about Google+ or indicated it was looking into the new social network as of this week. The Federal Trade Commission declined comment. 'Google is effectively using its popularity as a search engine provider to promote its social network by prioritizing Google+ data,' said PC World magazine last week. 'Bundling one smaller service on the back of another much bigger one is what sparked Microsoft's trouble with antitrust regulators through the late 1990s and early 2000s when it included Internet Explorer with Windows.' Google claims the lack of results from companies such as Twitter is due to their withdrawing from agreements about how Google indexes their results. 'We . are a bit surprised by Twitter's comments about Search plus Your World, . because they chose not to renew their agreement with us last summer,' says a company spokesperson. 'The laws are designed to help consumers benefit from innovation, not to . help competitors.  We believe that our improvements to search will benefit . consumers by better surfacing social content, and the great thing about the . openness of the Internet is that if users don’t like our service they can . easily switch to another site,' said a spokesperson. Google new 'Search plus your world' feature has come under fire from Twitter's general counsel for prioritising results from Google's Plus social network . The . Federal Trade Commission, attorneys general in six states, and the . European Commission are looking into complaints alleging Google has been . unfairly exploiting its dominance in Internet search to promote its . other services while ignoring or downplaying pertinent information about . its rivals. Senators are trying to get an accurate reading of the power the Californian company wields over the search industry. And by promoting its own social networking site, Google has pushed itself further into controversial territory. The . new changes are 'exactly the kind of thing that the antitrust people . are screaming about,' said Danny Sullivan, an industry expert who has . been following Google since the 1990s. 'This is very un-Google like. It's unfair to other services and it's unfair to people.' The . move has been compared by industry commentators Microsoft's 1998 . decision to bundle its own Internet Explorer with Windows, defeating . Netscape as the market leader of the day. Google has used personal data in its search results to varying degrees since since 2005. Monopoly moment: Bill Gates decided in 1998 to bundle its own Internet Explorer with Windows, defeating Netscape as the market leader of the day . But the 'next level' changes, . which were officially launched on Tuesday, may already have had a . sizeable effect on the number of people using Google Plus, which has . lagged behind Facebook and Twitter since its inception. The . internet analysis company Hitwise has reported that traffic to Google's . social networking site was up by 55 per cent in December, . month-to-month. It is . possible that the surge was simply caused by lots of gift-wrapped tablet . computers running Google applications, but Google is clearly set on . boosting its social network. Company spokesman Amit Singhal said: 'Search is simply better with your world in it, and we’re just getting started. 'You . can connect with them on Google+, strike up meaningful conversations . and discover entire communities in a way that simply wasn’t possible . before'. Behind the scenes . Google argues that its terms of service prevent it from trawling other . social networks - such as Facebook and Twitter - for information, which . means that if the 'big two' want to be included, they have to volunteer . their content to Google. Users can opt out out of the new . personal services by changing their settings but the move has been . slammed by Twitter's general counsel for 'warping' search results. Twitter's . Alex Macgillivray - an ex-employee of Google - tweeted from his . personal account: 'Bad day for the Internet. Having been there, I can . imagine the dissension at Google to search being warped this way.' But . the company issued a statement declaring the move will make it more . difficult to find breaking news and other compelling information shared . within the 250 million messages, or tweets, posted on its service each . day. Google Plus your world: The move has been slammed by Twitter, which claims it will be harder to find breaking news on the web . It said: 'We’re concerned that as a . result of Google’s changes, finding this information will be much harder . for everyone. We think that’s bad for people, publishers, news . organizations and Twitter users.' In . an interview with Marketing Land, Google's Eric Schmidt denied that the . company's results were made to prioritise Plus over other social . services. If the new formula . works as Google expects, the search results will include pertinent . information culled from the requestor's Plus account. For . instance, a query about a football team might include links and . comments made about the team by other people in one of the social . circles on the user's Plus account. The . feature has been automatically turned on for all English-language . searches made by users logged into Google. Turning off the personal . results permanently will require changing a setting in Google's personal . preferences. The personal . results can also be excluded on a search-by-search basis by clicking on . an icon of the globe on the results page (the personal results will be . denoted by a button featuring a human's silhouette). As . part of Tuesday's expansion, the profile pictures of Plus account . holders will appear in the drop-down suggestions on Google's search box. So when typing in 'Mary,' you may see those named Mary in your circle . along with those Google believes you'd find interesting. Searches . on general topics such as 'music' and 'sports,' will generate . suggestions on people and companies that have Plus accounts.","New opt-in 'Search Plus Your World' offers social results mixed in with search .

"By . Lynn Davidson . Last updated at 4:20 PM on 16th January 2012 . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has blasted Michael Gove's suggestion that the Queen should receive a new Royal Yacht as a gift in recognition of her Diamond Jubilee. Mr Gove, the Education Secretary, made the suggestion in a letter to Mr Clegg and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is overseeing the celebrations. In it, Mr Gove said the celebrations 'should go beyond those of previous jubilees and mark the greater achievement that the diamond anniversary represents'. But he has been forced to defend himself today after Mr Clegg dismissed the extravagance because hard-up voters don't want to see a debate between 'the haves and have-yachts.' Queen's pride and joy: Michael Gove wants a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia in recognition of the Diamond Jubilee . How it might look: An artist's impression of the as yet unnamed vessel that could be the future flagship of the UK . The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'Most . people in the country would think the diamond jubilee is a wonderful . occasion for us to celebrate together as a community and as a nation. 'But I suspect that most people in . the country would think, given that there is very little money around, . that this probably would not be the top of their list of priorities for . the use of scarce public resources.' He joked that it was a case of 'the haves and the have yachts' - before apologising for the poor quality of his quip. Last year the Daily Mail launched a . campaign for an £80million majestic new Royal Yacht to replace Britannia . – but one which is funded by donations, rather than by the taxpayer. Today David Cameron also said that public money should not be used to pay for a new Royal Yacht. Mr Cameron's spokesman said: 'Clearly . there is a difficult economic situation, there are scarce resources, . and therefore we don't think it would be an appropriate use of public . money at the present time.' Calls: Mr Gove, left, wrote a private letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt to say that he felt the Queen, pictured attending a church service yesterday, should be given a new Royal Yacht as a lasting legacy to her reign as monarch . Labour Party deputy chairman Tom Watson said: 'We're all looking forward to the diamond jubilee. The significance of the occasion should be celebrated across the country. 'But Michael Gove has shown he is out of touch with this proposal. 'When school budgets are being . slashed, parents will be wondering how Gove came even to suggest this . idea. This is not the time to spend £60 million on a yacht.' But Mr Gove, stung by the criticism, . said today in the House of Commons that he did not intend for public . money to be used for the vessel. How the Mail launched its campaign for a new royal yacht for the Queen's Jubilee . 'The letter which I wrote to the . Prime Minister on September 12 clearly stated that I agree of course the . project for a royal yacht, the future ship project for the 21st . century, was one - and I was quite clear in my letter - where no public . funding should be provided,' said Mr Gove. According to The Guardian, . the leaked letter was addressed to Mr Clegg and Culture Secretary Jeremy . Hunt and said that a private donation could be sought if insufficient . taxpayer funds were available. The Royal Yacht Britannia was . decommissioned by the Labour government in December 1997 – following an . initial decision by John Major’s government – and was the only time the . Queen has been seen to cry in public. Former Tory foreign secretary Lord . Hurd has described the decision to decommission the yacht as the . greatest mistake of John Major’s time in power. Britannia is now a visitor attraction in Edinburgh and was moved to a . dry dock earlier this month after it began taking on water due to a . faulty door seal. The new vessel proposed by the Daily . Mail would have £80million construction costs and would be funded by . donations from individuals and corporations. The 21st century successor to Britannia would be in keeping with Britain’s historic role as a great maritime nation. Codenamed FSP21 (Future Ship Project . 21st Century), the 515ft four-masted ship would incorporate the very . latest materials and technology. The plans include royal quarters and . state rooms for grand diplomatic and corporate events. Run by a . charitable trust, it would cover its own costs — through everything from . trade exhibitions to training sea cadets. The new ship would require teams of young people, known as ‘Queen’s cadets’, to clamber aloft in all weathers to keep it going. The 412-foot Royal Yacht Britannia . was launched in April 1953 at John Brown’s Clydebank Shipyard and served . the Queen for 44 years, carrying her and the Royal Family on 968 . official voyages. It travelled 1,087,623 nautical miles, calling at more than 600 ports in 135 countries. Prince Charles and Princess Diana, . Princess Margaret, Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of York all . honeymooned on it and last July Zara Phillips and England rugby star . Mike Tindall hosted a pre-wedding party on board the vessel which was . attended by Princes William and Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge. The ship is now owned by The Royal . Britannia Trust, a charitable organisation whose sole remit is the . maintenance of Britannia in keeping with its former role.","Michael Gove says Queen should be given gift as a mark of respect and to lift the country's spirits .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 7:43 AM on 18th January 2012 . Former North Korean leader's eldest son has said the new regime will 'not last long' under the rule of his half brother. Kim Jong Nam described the succession of power to Kim Jong Un as 'a joke to the outside world' in an email published yesterday by South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper. And he said his half brother would be 'just a nominal figure', adding: 'The members of the power elite will be the ones in actual power.' 'A joke': Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Il's eldest son, claims his half brother will not last long in power in North Korea . Kim Jong Un was only announced as Kim Jong Il's successor in September 2010 and he was thrust into leadership with the 'great leader' died last month. The 27-year-old has little experience of leadership or dealing with alliance-making necessary to holding on to power in the notoriously reclusive state. 'Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse,' the newspaper quoted Kim Jong Nam as saying. 'The Kim Jong Un regime will not last long.' Sibling rivalry: Kim Jong Nam is said to have fallen out of favour with his father after he was caught trying to sneak into Japan with a fake passport in 2001 . Power struggle: New leader Kim Jong Un will be a 'peripheral' figure in North Korea, according to his half brother . North Koreans have been told their new leader studied at Kim Il Sung Military University and was involved in military operations including the November 2010 artillery attack on a South Korean island that saw four people killed. He is seen as most like his father in manner and personality - crucial for the personality cult which is used to suppress opposition. Kim Jong Nam, aged around 40, is known for his playboy lifestyle and love of casinos. He is believed to have fallen out of favour with his father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in 2001, claiming he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort. He told the newspaper: 'Because I was educated in the West, I was able to enjoy freedom from early age, and I still love being free. Dictator in training: Kim Jong Il inspects Huichon power station in May last year, along with generals and his son . Rise to prominence: Despite being relatively unknown 15 months ago, Kim Jong Un was appointed a four-star general and an vice chairman in the North Korean communist party . Cult of personality: Since he took over as leader of North Korea, the country's military has been keen to play down his lack of experience with bombastic displays like this one in Pyongyang . The Associated Press has become the first international news organisation to establish a full-time presence in North Korea. In a ceremony a month after the death of long-time ruler Kim Jong Il, AP president and chief executive Tom Curley inaugurated a new office inside the headquarters of the state-run Korean Central News Agency in Pyongyang. The bureau expands the agency's presence in North Korea, following a breakthrough in 2006 when it opened a video office in the capital. Exclusive video from AP was used by media outlets around the world following Kim Jong Il's death. It marks an important gesture after decades of being off-limits to international journalists. AP, an independent 165-year-old news cooperative founded in New York, has operations in more than 100 countries and employs nearly 2,500 journalists. Mr Curley said: 'Beyond this door lies a path to vastly larger understanding and cultural enrichment for millions around the world. 'Regardless of whether you were born in Pyonyang or Pennsylvania, you are aware of the bridge being created today.' 'The reason I visit Macau so often is because it's the most free and liberal place near China, where my family lives.' The South Korean newspaper said a Japanese journalist, Yoji Komi, exchanged almost 100 emails with Kim Jong Nam between 2004 and December last year. It comes as a senior North Korean party official dismissed concerns about Kim Jong Un's readiness to lead. Politburo member and family confidante Yang Hyong Sop said the country's people were in good hands with their new leader. He said: 'We suffered the greatest loss in the history of our nation as a result of the sudden, unexpected and tragic loss of the great leader Kim Jong Il. 'But still, we are not worried a bit, . because we know that we are being led by comrade Kim Jong Un, who is . fully prepared to carry on the heritage created by the great General Kim . Jong Il.' White mourning . bouquets and massive portraits of the deceased leader have been cleared . from capital Pyongyang's main buildings and monuments. After . Kim Jong Il's death, streets and squares in Pyongyang were filled with . hysterical people weeping and crying out in apparent anguish. His son's rapid ascension to power has . raised questions about how ready he is to inherit rule over the . 24million population with a nuclear programme as well as chronic trouble . feeding all its people. Mr . Yang added: 'It's not a secret that he has helped the great general in . many different aspects - not only in military affairs but also the . economy and other areas as well.'","Kim Jong Nam claims his half brother is a 'joke to the outside world'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:11 AM on 4th January 2012 . The Lawrence killers will be sentenced as juveniles and could serve as little as 12 years for Britain’s most notorious race murder. This is because Gary Dobson and David Norris, now in their mid-30s with receding hairlines, were teenagers when they were part of the mob that stabbed Stephen Lawrence to death in April 1993. The Criminal Justice Act 1991 sets out the range of sentencing options open to trial judge Mr Justice Treacy when he recommends the length of their jail terms today. In the dock: Dobson, left, and Norris in an artist's impression of the scene as the verdicts were read out . Technically they will be ‘detained at Her Majesty’s Pleasure’ – the equivalent of a life sentence. They will then be considered for release on parole after serving the minimum term. The starting point for a murder conviction is 12 years. However, the court can take into account the fact that Stephen’s murder was racially aggravated. Mark Ellison QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey that in a case of this age the law requires a court ‘to sentence to effectively what would have been the punishment shortly after the crime had been committed’. He said: ‘In the context of this case particularly, the age of the defendants being 16 and 17, the punishment the court would impose would be very much directed at those ages.’ Teenagers: Gary Dobson and David Norris, now in . their mid-30s with receding hairlines, were teenagers when they were . part of the mob that stabbed Stephen Lawrence to death in April 1993 . Once sentenced both Dobson and Norris will need special protection from prison revenge attacks because of the notoriety of their crime. Insiders believe they could be given ‘vulnerable’ prisoner status and placed with sex offenders in a segregated wing of prison to ensure they are not ambushed by inmates furious about their role in Stephen’s death. The Mail can reveal that Norris was attacked by three black inmates while on remand in Belmarsh prison, South London, just weeks after he was arrested for Stephen’s murder in September 2010. Prison sources said the three men, thought to be Muslims, beat him after Norris tried to ‘throw his weight around’ by using his family underworld reputation. Norris was attacked by three black inmates while on remand in Belmarsh prison, South London, pictured, just weeks after he was arrested for Stephen¿s murder in September 2010 . The attack left him with problems to his hearing and throughout the trial he had to wear a special headset to follow the proceedings. It also saw extra protection placed on him at the prison and heightened fears that he and Dobson will be ‘marked men’. Following their convictions yesterday, the pair were taken to Belmarsh. In due course, they are likely to be transferred to Category A prisons elsewhere in the country. Prison bosses will be mindful they have a ‘duty of care’. Soham murderer Ian Huntley, who was slashed in the throat in 2010 in jail, attempted to sue authorities for failing to protect him.","Both will need special protection in prison from revenge attacks .

A barman who 'mooned' the Queen with an Australian flag tucked between the cheeks of his bare bottom will not be charged with wilful exposure, police said today. Liam Warriner, from Sydney,  will plead guilty to a lesser charge of causing a public nuisance, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. He flashed the 85-year-old monarch and Prince Philip, 90, as their motorcade was driven through Brisbane last October. The 22-year-old was understood to have been unloading shipping containers at the time. Remorseless: Liam Warriner will not be charged with wilful exposure after 'mooning' the Queen during her visit to Brisbane in October. He will plead guilty to the lesser charge of causing a public nuisance, police said . Guest of honour: The Queen, accompanied by Prince Philip and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, walks down a slipway to board a cruiser on the Brisbane River. Shortly beforehand, police said the monarch was 'mooned' by Warriner as she passed him in her motorcade . Police today told Brisbane Magistrates Court that they have dropped the charge of wilful exposure, which carries a penalty of one year in prison. Defence attorney John-Paul Mould told . Magistrate Brian Hine that Warriner will plead guilty to creating a public nuisance when he appears for sentencing on February . 14. It is not clear whether the royal couple saw Warriner. Warriner, who was not in court today, has admitted holding an Australian flag clenched between his . bare buttocks and running as the royal couple's motorcade drove by. But he maintained that he did not expose his genitals as alleged in the willful exposure charge. ‘I mooned the Queen,’ Warriner said after being charged last year. ‘I did it because my workmates dared me to.’ Speaking with a sense of pride at his actions, Warriner added: ‘Everybody’s seen someone’s butt, come on. ‘You see it on TV all the time, you see it in movies, it’s accepted in PG rated programming these days. ‘But yet it’s an offence to the Queen.’ The Queen and Prince Philip prepare to set off down the river to view areas of Brisbane left devastated after the floods of January last year . Well-wishers: Thousands of people line the Brisbane River in the city's South Bank to wave to the Queen during the royal visit . Warriner, who gave the V for victory sign as he spoke, said the Queen waved at him and that was when he dropped his trousers. But his claim that the Queen had singled him out for a wave was highly unlikely. Thousands of people were lining the . banks of the Brisbane River along which the Queen was sailing and most . people were so far away from the cruiser that it is doubtful she saw . what any individual was doing. Warriner said he ran for 50 yards with his trousers and underwear down, but no-one saw anything other than his bare bottom. He said: ‘Not the front at all. There were loads of people there to see the Queen. I wouldn’t want all of them seeing that.’ Warriner is no stranger to protests against authority. He revealed he is part of an anti-elite protest movement called Occupy and had recently taken part in protests in Sydney. He said: ‘I’d like to say we are the 99 per cent human need over corporate greed and we won’t accept any of this any longer.' Police later clarified where Warriner had been standing. They said he was in an area at the roadside where the Queen was passing by in a motorcade before she stepped onto the cruiser to sail down the river. A spokeswoman for Queensland police said: ‘Police officers at the front of the motorcade saw the alleged incident and reported to others further back.'","Liam Warriner flashed the Queen and Prince Philip in Brisbane last October .

A neighbour of two feuding men found dead in their homes has revealed how he feared for his life as one of them tried to smash into his house with an axe. Roofer Mark Taylor said it was like a scene from The Shining when Richard Wight started hacking at the door of his home in Braintree, Essex. He said: 'We heard a big thud on the front door. My lodger went upstairs and looked down and said, ""he's got an axe"". Not a small axe; a 3ft chopper. 'He cut a hole in the door and, like in the film The Shining, put his face through it.' The body of Mr Wight, 55, was found . in his home on Sunday afternoon after paramedics were called to the home . of his neighbour Alan Taylor, 59. It was confirmed today that Mr Wight died from stab wounds and his neighbour died from cardiac arrest . Discovery: The scene in Braintree, Essex, where two bodies were found in neighbouring homes. One of the bodies was that of Richard Wight, who threatened Mark Taylor with an axe . Mark Taylor said Mr Wight hacked a hole in his door and stuck his face through it like Jack Nicholson in The Shining . Mark, 37, revealed how Mr Wight once came to his home . with the axe minutes after shoulder-charging his porch door and . punching through its glass panel. Mr Taylor said Mr Wight was shouting, 'I've f****** had enough of you', but left before police arrived. Mark said Mr Wight 'smoked pot and liked a drink' and was known to clash with his neighbours. On Sunday, lorry driver Mr Wight was . found dead by police investigating the death of next-door neighbour Alan . Taylor, 59 - who was not related to Mark. Police are treating the deaths as suspicious but are not looking for anybody else. An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Provisional results of the post-mortem on Alan Taylor have concluded that he died from natural causes. 'Provisional results of the post-mortem of Richard Wight have concluded that he died from stab wounds.' It is thought that a 'mild-mannered' Mr Taylor may have snapped and killed his 'neighbour from hell' before . suffering a fatal heart attack. The two men were said to be involved in a long-running feud over parking. One resident, who did not wish to be . named, said: 'They certainly didn't get on and people are saying that it . got worse over Christmas.' The lorry driver had a long history of terrorising neighbours in his street in Braintree, Essex. In 2008 he was jailed for eight weeks after going to Mr Taylor's home twice on the same day and harassing him. Neighbours said he spent seven months in custody in 2002 while awaiting a court hearing for threatening to kill Mark with an axe, but the CPS had no record of this incident. He had an Asbo slapped on him in 2007 to address 'threatening and abusive behaviour' towards neighbours. In 2009 he was convicted of breaching the Asbo after he abused Alan Taylor. He received a six-month conditional discharge. Wight is believed to have served time in prison. Officers found cannabis at his house when they arrested him. Neighbours said Alan Taylor and Richard Wight had rowed regularly before their deaths . Neighbours said Mr Wight would . 'worry' about leaving his van in the lane and often shouted at takeaway . drivers who blocked up the road. One neighbour, who didn't want to be . named, said: 'Something had been going on between the pair of them - we . said it looked like that had been rowing, it was as though they were at . war over something. 'There was definitely tension there when I saw them.' A police spokesman said the investigation would centre upon both men's movements since January 1. An Essex Police spokesman said: 'From initial forensic examinations, there is every indication that we will not be looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths of Alan Taylor and Richard Wight. 'Forensic examinations of both addresses are continuing in order to clarify this position.' Anyone with information should contact Essex Police on 101.","Mark Taylor says Richard Wight hacked at his front door with a 3ft axe .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 6:55 PM on 17th January 2012 . A thug who punched a frail 92-year-old in a row over a dog has escaped jail after a court heard that a prison term would disrupt his anger management course. Adam Strangward, 27, was convicted of assaulting pensioner Bob Savory at a hearing last month and was told he faced prison for the attack, which left widower Mr Savory scared to leave his house, according to relatives. But Strangward was handed a suspended sentence after a judge at Peterborough Magistrates Court heard that a custodial sentence would interrupt his progress on a nine-month anger management course. Injured: Bob Savory was assaulted as he walked his Jack Russell Patch along the River Nene in Peterborough. He suffered a black eye and cuts to his face . Pensioner Bob Savory was assaulted as he walked his beloved Jack Russell dog Patch along the River Nene in Peterborough on July 28 last year. Mr Savory, who uses a walking stick, claims that he was asked to keep Patch on a lead by Strangward, which resulted in the pair becoming embroiled in an argument. The retired bricklayer, from Peterborough, suffered a black eye and cut to his face in the attack on July 28 last year. In letters from Mr Savory’s family which were read to the court, his two daughters Pauline Morgan, 62, and Avril Beddows, 54, who sat in the public gallery, told of the effect the attack had on their father. Adam Strangward, 27, was convicted of assault but received a suspended sentence . Mrs Beddows' statement said: 'His twilight years have been taken away from him. 'He was just getting his sense of humour back after losing mum, who died two years ago. 'After this he doesn’t go out so much.” Mrs Morgan's note read: 'My dad is 92 and he is a true gentleman. 'All the children in the area call him Uncle Bob and they were upset by what happened.' Speaking . after Strangward’s conviction last month, daughter Ms Morgan said that . her father’s confidence had been shattered following the incident and . that he no longer liked venturing outdoors. She said: 'He was a very active, outgoing, 92-year-old man who used to walk Patch every day but he seldom does that now. 'My dad’s wife Barbara died just over two years ago and we then got dad Patch to keep him company. 'Patch . and him became very close and my dad loved walking him down by the . river - he would do that route every day for two hours at a time. 'He still goes out and walks with Patch but these are much shorter and happen less regularly. 'My dad is a strong character and will make a full recovery but this really hit him for six. 'He didn’t deserve what happened to him.' Strangward, who pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to one charge of assault by beating, was given a 16 week jail-term, suspended for two years. He will also have to pay £200 in costs and £200 in compensation to his elderly victim, as well as complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Sentencing, District judge Ken Sheraton said he acknowledged Strangward’s progress on the anger management course. He also noted that a custodial sentence would take Strangward, who lives with his partner and their three children aged five, four and three, away from his family. Judge Sheraton said: 'A custodial sentence is fully justified, the decision is whether that should be suspended. 'I do consider the supervision you are undertaking as having a beneficial effect. 'Any immediate sentence could have and adverse effect on you, but more importantly to the general public. It is because of that I suspend your sentence.' The court heard that Strangward had started an Integrated Domestic Abuse Programme last year. Julie Murtagh, defending, said: 'He is four months into a nine month programme. 'He has committed to the sessions and has attended all of his appointments. 'He is engaging with the probation service. His well-being seems more well-balanced and he is on anti-depressants.'",Bob Savory now too scared to leave his house .

Life story: Joran van der Sloot was asked to detail his life by a psychologist after confessing to killing Peruvian student Stephany Flores in May 2010 . The troubled life of a Dutch citizen jailed for 28 years for killing a Peruvian student in a fit of rage has been laid bare in a handwritten letter to police. Joran van der Sloot pleaded guilty to killing Stephany Flores, 21, in Lima, Peru, in May 2010 after earlier meeting her in a casino. He confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after she found out about his arrest and suspected involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway seven years ago. Titled 'My Personal Story', van der Sloot, 24, was asked to write the document by forensic psychologist Silvia Roja Regalado as part of a handwriting examination after his arrest for the murder of Miss Flores. Written on a crumpled piece of paper, he talks about his childhood in Aruba, his relationships and the death of his father in 2010. Excerpts of the letter on RadarOnline said: '(I) always had a lot of friends and even girlfriends. When I was 14 I had my first serious relationship. 'When I was 17 I got arrested by the police on Aruba. They suspected me of the disappearance of an American girl. 'I was in jail for three months and then released. After this my dream of studying in the U.S. was impossible. 'My father died on the 14th of February 2010 and I returned to Aruba to be with my mother and help her with things.' Van der Sloot ends his life story two weeks before Miss Flores was found beaten and strangled to death in a Lima hotel room. He was sentenced to 28 years in jail by a Peruvian court on Friday and ordered to pay $75,000 in reparations to her family. Victim: Stephany Flores, 21, was beaten and strangled by van der Sloot after finding out about police suspicions over his involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway, right, in 2005 . This is the letter written by van der Sloot which was handed to police. He was asked to write the text by a forensic psychologist . He can still appeal the conviction and . sentence, and under Peru's penal system he could become eligible for . parole after serving half of his sentence - possibly in 2038. His . lawyer had argued that he killed Miss Flores during a fit of rage he . blamed on psychological trauma from being hounded as the prime suspect . in the Holloway case. The . court heard van der Sloot killed the business student with 'ferocity' and 'cruelty', concealing the crime and then fleeing to Chile, where he . was caught two days after her decaying body was found. He . took more than $200 in cash and credit cards from the victim and made . his initial getaway in her car, leaving it in a different part of Lima. Sentence: Van der Sloot was jailed for 28 years and sent to the San Juan de Lurigancho prison in Lima, Peru .

This video grab Van der Sloot (top second right) with Stephany Flores (right) playing at a casino before her murder on May 30, 2010 in Lima . The prosecution had sought a 30-year sentence for first-degree murder and theft. Miss Flores was killed five years to the day after Miss Holloway, an 18-year-old from the Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook, disappeared on Aruba. Natalee disappeared on May 30, 2005, during a high school graduation trip to the Caribbean island, where van der Sloot grew up. Her body was never found. U.S. authorities are moving to extradite him to face charges over Miss Holloway's case. Van der Sloot is accused in Alabama of extorting $25,000 from Beth Holloway to reveal the location of her daughter's body. Prosecutors said the money was paid, but nothing was disclosed about the woman's whereabouts. Authorities claim he used the money to travel to Peru on May 14, 2010. Investigators have long worked from the assumption that the young woman was dead in Aruba, where the case was classified as a homicide investigation. - Born in Arnhem on the 6th of August 1987. - Moved to Aruba when I was 2 years old. - Went to the International School of Aruba from 2nd to 12th grade.

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 3:11 PM on 17th January 2012 . Milton Brown has been released after serving 14 years in prison for attacking two women . A rapist who subjected his victims to a five-day ordeal in the witness box has been freed early after serving just 14 years. Milton Brown, now 57, was jailed in January 1998 for a total of 21 years for savage attacks on three women, including former girlfriend Susan McDonald – who went on to kill herself. At his trial at the Old Bailey, Brown defended himself, spending five days cross-examining Ms . McDonald and another victim about the savage attacks. After the trial it emerged he had 58 convictions for violence, dishonesty and sexual offences, including child molestation, spanning 29 years. Now he has been spotted back on the streets where he carried out his campaign of terror after serving just two thirds of his sentence. Miss McDonald, then 29, was held captive for three months by crack addict Milton Brown in his barred and padlocked flat in Camberwell, south London. He repeatedly beat her with a pool cue and a plank studded with nails. She was left with a broken arm and covered from head to toe in bruises. Her injuries left her on crutches for four months. At the trial he was said to have carried out a 'merciless cross-examination clearly designed only to intimidate and humiliate them'. Making use of his rights as he conducted his own defence, Brown questioned them for several days, forcing them to read out long, intimate passages from their statements. So great was the public outcry over their ordeal that the law was changed to prevent rapists questioning their alleged victims in court. In court Judge Leo Charles QC told Brown: 'You lack the factor that distinguishes man from beast, namely humanity.' Brown was jailed for five years for causing grievous bodily harm to Miss McDonald, which came on top of he 16 years he was given for the triple knifepoint rape of a 38-year-old widow, Sandra Summers, and indecent assault on a neuroscientist aged 31. Mrs Summers, who waived her right to anonymity, said at the time: 'I cannot understand how the British justice system has allowed me to be put through this. I was raped again, emotionally, inside that witness box.' She had been held in Brown’s flat for 15 hours and raped three times at knifepoint. Brown put one of his victims through a three-month ordeal in a flat in Camberwell, south London (file picture) A detective in the case described Brown as 'the most evil man I have ever come across'. In May 2004, Ms McDonald was found dead in her flat in West Norwood, south London, surrounded by empty pill bottles. Susan's mother Sandra, 62, told the Sun she was not even tipped off Brown had been let out on probation after serving two-thirds of his sentence. She said yesterday: 'It's an insult. Susan never recovered from what he did to her. There is nothing stopping my other daughter or Susan's son from bumping into him.' Brown has been given his own flat in Tottenham, north London, which the council is believed to be paying for. The Sun reported seeing him cycling unmonitored around the capital - including weekly trips to Camberwell to check in with probation. Brown said he deserved to be free. 'I've changed,' he told The Sun. The Justice Ministry insisted: ‘Serious sex offenders released from prison are closely supervised.’","One victim killed herself having never got over the ordeal .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 11:38 PM on 18th January 2012 . Two thugs involved in an attack on an innocent man in the street which put him in hospital for a month were spared prison after telling a judge they were sorry for their actions. Quite how long that remorse lasted is apparent from this picture. Emerging from court, Daniel Chrapkowski gleefully punched the air with both hands and danced on the steps, while his accomplice Thomas Lane made an obscene gesture and squared up to reporters and photographers. Yob: Daniel Chrapkowski celebrates outside Manchester Crown Court after he escaped jail for his part in the drunken street attack . Glee: Thomas Lane swears at photographers as he leaves the court with a non-custodial sentence . Their victim, Joseph O’Reilly, 24, yesterday said he felt ‘angry and frustrated’. He told the Daily Mail: ‘It makes my . blood boil to think that they were rejoicing when they came out of . court. I cannot believe the way they are behaving. ‘One of them looks as if he has just . won an award, not escaped prison for a vicious beating. The other one . looks like he doesn’t give two hoots about what happened. Victim: Joseph O'Reilly, 24, was savagely set upon by the three drunken yobs after asking why they were kicking wheelie bins around Manchester city centre . 'These two are a disgrace. It’s as if . they’ve just been let off their crime and they haven’t been punished at . all – yet I’ve had to serve my own sentence because of my injuries. ‘The fact they were celebrating proves they assumed they were going to go to jail – yet the judge just let them go.’ Manchester Crown Court heard that the . attack happened in January last year after Mr O’Reilly, an office . worker, had been for a night out in the city centre with his girlfriend . Lucy Blackledge, 22, a sales adviser. They were heading for home when they spotted a gang  walking towards them, kicking over bins and scattering rubbish in the road. When Mr O’Reilly asked them: ‘What on Earth are you doing?’, they turned on him and his girlfriend. Lane started ‘shadow boxing’ in front . of Mr O’Reilly before Chrapkowski punched him in the face then tripped . him, causing him to fall to the pavement. Mr O’Reilly was repeatedly punched and . kicked in the face and stomach before the gang ran off. He spent more . than 40 hours undergoing X-rays and scans as well as emergency treatment . for his injuries. He suffered a badly fractured jaw and a bleed on the brain, and was forced to have a metal plate fitted into his face. Months after the attack he had to go . back into hospital after collapsing and he still suffers severe dizzy . spells and numbness in his mouth. A year on Mr O’Reilly says he can chew food on only one side and worries about going out alone from his home in east Manchester. The brutal attack happened when the gang set on Joseph O'Reilly outside Manchester Piccadilly Station . In sentencing the gang, Judge Martin Steiger said the trio had been drinking a 'considerable amount' Tattooed, jobless Chrapkowski, 24, . from Stockport, was given a 12-month suspended prison term, . electronically tagged for two months and ordered to complete 160 hours . unpaid work after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm. Lane, a sign . writer, also 24 and from Stockport, insisted he made no physical . contact with the victim. He admitted affray and was given a . community order for 12 months, ordered to complete 120 hours unpaid . work, abide by a curfew and pay £250 costs. A third man, Oliver O’Neill, 23, from . Bramhall – who was on bail for another vicious attack at the time of the . assault on Mr O’Reilly – was jailed for 27 months after admitting two . counts of GBH. Katie Jones, defending Chrapkowski, . said: ‘He is extremely remorseful and wishes to apologise to the court. It is extremely out of character.’ Paul Hodgkinson, defending Lane, said: . ‘He accepts he had been out drinking and engaging in tomfoolery, but . that mischief doesn’t cross the custody threshold.’ Judge Martin Steiger QC said: ‘Drink . was involved and in particular I bear in mind that O’Neill was . responsible for significant bodily harm.’","Thug whoops with glee after attack which left victim hospitalised for a month .

A transsexual who posed as a gynaecologist and treated dozens of women at an illegal practice is today facing up to five years in jail. Alexandra Svobodova - born Martin Sloboda before undergoing a sex change operation - carried out internal examinations on her unsuspecting patients. The 30-year-old even prescribed prescription drugs for them, police claim. Arrested: Transsexual Alexandra Svobodova posed as a gynaecologist and treated dozens of women at an illegal practice, police claim . The bogus doctor was arrested this week in the rural town of Bechyne in the Czech Republic, where her private practice is based. Patient Lucie Hrabalova, 35, said: 'It's bad enough knowing that my . gynaecologist was a fake and not qualified, but the fact that he was . also a man as well is devastating. 'I hope they lock the pervert up and . throw away the key.' Svobodova had a sex change operation after travelling to Germany in 2001 because the operation was not available in the Czech Republic. Police spokesperson Jiri Matzner said: 'She faces charges of fraud and infringing others’ rights after posing as a doctor as well as illegally prescribing drugs containing narcotics and psychotropic substances. 'We have 20 cases so far of people who were victims, in addition to the affected health insurance companies. 'She is an enterprising woman with a long criminal past. If convicted she faces up to five years in jail.' Entrance: The door of Svobodova's fake practice in the Czech town of Bechyne .

After swindling £5million out of her customers, she was arrested and convicted of fraud in 2009. She was given a suspended sentence of one year. Among those to fall victim to her services were major Czech celebrities including pop singer Helena Vondrackova and singer/actress Monika Absolonova.",Alexandra Svobodova was previously jailed for swindling £5m out of clients while posing as a lawyer .
