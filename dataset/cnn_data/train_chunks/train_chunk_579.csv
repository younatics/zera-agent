Forget sausage and mash and Sunday roasts, the latest food fads are moving away from the traditional and embracing the unusual, according to a list of top trends in a leading magazine. Thanks to outlandish recipes championed by leading chefs like Heston Blumenthal, vegetables masquerading as dessert and an obsession with mould have made Olive magazine's list of top trends for 2013. Chefs presenting their food on building materials such as bricks and tiles will also be a big favourite this year according to the list. Following in Heston's footsteps? The latest food trends are moving more away from the traditional and embracing the unusual according to Olive magazine . Service: Unusually served food on things like building materials and tiles are all the rage this year according to Olive magazine . Trend setter: Tuddenham Mill in Suffolk serves a savoury chestnut, salted caramel and artichoke dessert . Among those already embracing that trend is chef Ben Spalding whose 'lick a brick' stunt during a recent stint at Islington's John Salt saw customers licking chicken mousse and caramel from a London brick. Meanwhile, diners at Gail's Kitchen in Holborn can enjoy a truffled taleggio toastie served on a miniature tile. For foodies looking for something a little more out there than apple crumble for dessert, a savoury chestnut, salted caramel and artichoke dessert at Tuddenham Mill in Suffolk and candied celeriac at Nottingham's Sat Bains also gained acclaim in the list. Customers can also sample 'rotten' food cultured in Kilner preserving jars in the latter's cellar. Odd: Bizarre techniques, such as using liquid nitrogen in food preparation, are taking over from traditional methods of cooking . Pioneering: Sat Bains in Nottinghamshire, pictured, is serving candied celeriac . But some new twists on popular classics were also recognised. Savoury doughnuts and a 'posh' makeover for condensed milk that sees it fried with bananas and used to sweeten porridge were praised by the magazine. Olive editor Christine Hayes said: 'Something odd is happening in the food scene. Weirdness is in, in a big way, with the most outlandish ideas catching on in a way that simply hasn't happened before. 'Normal rules are being thrown out of the window. 'It might not be to everyone's taste but it really helps to highlight the extent to which the UK is leading the world in innovation.'

Apologies: Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the criticisms prompted 'deep reflection' and persuaded the company to change its repair policies . Apple has apologised to Chinese consumers following government media attacks on its repair policies. A statement posted by Apple in Chinese on its website said the complaints had prompted 'deep reflection' and persuaded the company of the need to revamp its repair policies, boost communication with Chinese consumers and strengthen oversight of authorised resellers. State broadcaster China Central Television and the ruling party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, had led the charge against the American company. They accused Apple of arrogance, greed and 'throwing its weight around' and portrayed it as the latest Western company to exploit the Chinese consumer. The attacks prompted some internet users and consumers to deride the broadcaster. Apple has now responded to the attacks with an apology from chief executive Tim Cook. 'We've come to understand through this process that because of our poor communication, some have come to feel that Apple's attitude is arrogant and that we don't care about or value feedback from the consumer,' his Chinese statement said. 'For the concerns and misunderstandings passed on to the consumer, we express our sincere apologies.' The People's Daily newspaper ran an editorial last Wednesday headlined: 'Strike down Apple's incomparable arrogance.' It wrote: 'Here we have the Western person's sense of superiority making mischief. 'If there's no risk in offending the Chinese consumer, and it also makes for lower overheads, then why not?' Chinese observers accused People's Daily of hypocrisy and pointed out the newspaper had remained silent when Chinese companies were implicated over food safety, pollution and other scandals. Complaints by celebrities on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, accompanied the broadcast by CCTV. Popular: Apple sold 2million iPhone 5s during the first weekend it was available in China. Picture shows an employee cleaning an advert at an Apple store on the eve of iPhone 5's release, in Wuhan, Hubei province, in December . Popular business magazine Caijing said its readers identified a long list of abusers, including state banks that lend to those with political connections while leaving ordinary savers with low rates on deposits. Despite the government's pressures, sales of Apple products in the region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, grew 67 per cent to $6.8billion - £4.5billion - in the first three months of 2013, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the company. Apple sold 2million iPhone 5s during the first weekend it was available in China, in December. The region is Apple's third largest market, accounting for 13 per cent of all sales last year. More than 17,000 outlets sell its products in mainland China, a figure that includes 11 Apple stores and 400 premium resellers. Changes: Apple has now extended the warranty of any iPhone 4 or 4S in China which has been repaired in the last year . In January, Mr Cook said he expected China to replace North America as its largest source of revenue in the foreseeable future. The attacks on Apple centre on complaints over Apple's repair policies in China - specifically its practice of only replacing faulty parts rather than providing new iPhones, as it does in other markets. Critics say that allows Apple to avoid having to extend its service warranty by another year. According to the Financial Times, Apple has extended the warranty of any iPhone 4 or 4S which has been repaired in the last year. This service is not on offer elsewhere.","State media attacked Apple for its arrogance and greed .

Investment: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, worth an estimated $36billion, has reached a deal to purchase 98 per cent of Lanai . Technology billionaire Larry Ellison has seen off Bill Gates to snap up a share of Hawaiian island Lanai. The Oracle CEO, worth an estimated $36billion, reached a deal to purchase 98 per cent of the paradise inlay yesterday, according to Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie. There were rumours Ellison, who already has a house on the island, was in the running as was Gates, who got married to wife Melinda on the island in 1994. Current owner, self-made billionaire David Murdock said he would keep his home on Lanai and the . right to build a wind farm, a controversial project that would place . windmills on as many as 20 square miles of the island and deliver power . to Oahu through an undersea cable. The final price tag for the 141 . square miles was not immediately clear, but the asking price had been . put at between $500million and $600million, according to reports. Lanai is relatively untouched . compared to other Hawaiian holiday hotspots, with only 30 miles of paved . roads on the 141 square-mile island, according to Associated Press. It is home to 3,200 residents and boasts several luxury resorts. Holiday makers . and explorers come to see the lunar landscapes of Keahiakawelo (or the . 'Garden of the Gods') and Pu'u Pehe, which is also known as Sweetheart . Rock, as well as take advantage of the stunning coastline. Paradise: The 141 square-mile paradise island had a reported price tag of $600million. The relatively untouched island features attractions such as Pu'u Pehe Rock [pictured] . Holiday hotspot: Lanai is the smallest publicly-accessible island in Hawaii . Trumped: Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, who had his wedding on the island in 1994, was rumoured to have been in the running to buy the island . As such Lanai is a developer's dream. But, just like George Clooney's character land baron Matt King in the . film The Descendants, officials are concerned that a new buyer will . over-develop the unspoiled land. Mr Murdock said in a statement that selling Lanai was not an impulsive . decision, but he has been looking for a buyer who would have the right . enthusiasm, commitment and respect for the island's residents. He said: 'I have learned in life that change is inevitable and can be quite positive when guided in the right direction.' Abercrombie said Ellison has had a . longstanding interest in the island. 'We look forward to welcoming Mr . Ellison in the near future,' he said. 'His passion for nature, particularly the ocean is well known specifically in the realm of America's Cup sailing.' Unspoiled: The area is relatively untouched, compared to other areas in Hawaii, with only 30 miles of paved roads on the 141 square-mile island . Lush terrain: The only major developments on the island, which was formerly famous for its pineapples, have been two Four Season's hotels and two golf courses . Protected: Just like George Clooney's character in The Descendants, the mayor of the island is concerned new buyers will over-develop the area . With a reported price tag of £600million, Lanai did not come cheap. But the undisclosed final amount is a relative drop in the crystal clear ocean for new owner Larry Ellison, whose net worth is estimated at £36billion, according to Forbes. The 67-year-old is sixth on Forbes' list of global billionaires, but four below Microsoft giant Bill Gates who was rumoured to have been in the running to buy the 141 sq mile inlay, where he married wife Melinda in 1994. Ellison, a keen yachtsman - he won the America's Cup in 2010 - has been divorced four times. His friend, the late Apple boss Steve Jobs, was the official photographer at Ellison's fourth wedding to romance novelist Melanie Craft. They divorced in 2010. The new owner of Lanai is a licensed pilot and owns several private jets. As you'd expect he also owns an array of supercars and has a penchant for the Acura NSX, which he doles out as gifts. He has a keen property portfolio, which includes a Californian estate worth an estimated $110m and more than 12 properties in Malibu. The entertainment system in one of his houses is also rumoured to have cost $1million and includes a rock concert-sized video projector at one end of a drained swimming pool. The deal involves 88,000 acres of . land, plus two resorts, two golf courses, a stable and various . residential and commercial buildings, lawyers for Murdock told the . utilities commission in its application. Ellison plans to pay cash, and the . deal should result in new jobs, economic stimulus and a reinvigorated . local tourism industry, the application said. 'The buyer anticipates making . substantial investments in Lanai and is looking forward to partnering . with the people of Lanai to chart the island's future,' Castle & . Cooke lawyers said in the application. Lanai is known as Pineapple Island . as in 1922, James Dole, the president of the Hawaiian Pineapple . Company, bought the land and turned it into the world's largest . plantation of the fruit. However, Mr Murdock halted the . heritage industry on the island when he acquired the fruit and vegetable . company (and turned it into the world's largest producer in the . process). But he was more . modest in the development of Lanai's big-scale tourism industry, . approving only two major luxury Four Season's resorts and two golf . courses. However, as the . island is already a popular tourist destination, with 26,000 people . already visiting the island this year, according to the Hawaii Tourism . Association, Ellison may want to take advantage of the money-making potential of the area.","Oracle CEO reaches deal to purchast 98 per cent of Lanai .

Sentencing: Howard Randall pictured outside Hammersmith Magistrates Court today shortly before he was jailed for a benefit scam . A fraudster who claimed more than £12,000 in housing benefits by claiming to live alone despite sharing a flat with his boyfriend has been jailed for four months today. Howard Randall, 54, shares the head porter's flat at Lowndes Lodge, in Belgravia, with his partner of 20 years. But he forged documents which claimed he lived alone in a vacant studio apartment in the same landmark block in order to be eligible for £115 benefits per week. Unemployed Randall even forged documents in an attempt to claim back payments when his benefits were stopped after he went on holiday to the Far East for several months. Sentencing Randall at Hammersmith Magistrates Court, Judge Howard Fanning said: 'This was a calculated deception from the outset, targeting public funds to satisfy your own greed. 'You then tinkered with the scam to make further funds for yourself.' The court had heard that Randall had forged a lease and various letters from individuals purporting to be the landlord and the landlord's agent in order to claim benefits for more than two years. After he went to Thailand for 'a number of months', his Jobseeker's Allowance was stopped and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea called his case in for review. When he returned he made another application for housing benefit and asked for it to be back-dated. He even submitted a fraudulent letter claiming that the rent had been increased in a bid to up his payments to £150-a-week. Prosecutor Roger Hodkinson said: 'This was clearly a planned fraud and the only explanation offered was that he had received requests for council tax payments, which he and his partner did not think he was liable for. 'The flat was empty and Mr Randall decided to make and application for housing benefit even though he did not occupy the flat and the fraud continued for over two years. Upmarket: Lowndes Lodge, Belgravia, where Randall claimed housing benefit on a neighbour's vacant flat . 'Not only was this a fraud initially, but Mr. Randall decided he could get more.' Council investigators visited the flat in July last year and after confirming it was not occupied called Randall in for an interview. 'He signed a statement that was effectively a full confession. He admitted it was greed,' explained Mr Hodkinson. When initially claiming benefit in April 2010, Randall declared he had no savings, but told investigators he financed his trip to Thailand from a nest egg. He received £10,324 in housing benefit and £2,104 in council tax benefit in total. Defending Randall Naomi Alcendor told the court her client needed funds to finance civil legal proceedings in 2010. She said: 'This fraud was run at this time and he knows there is no excuse and there is no justification. 'He was not working and money was extremely tight and under pressure he made some unwise choices and is extremely remorseful. 'Money is now being deducted from his benefits. A nominal amount.' There was no court order for compensation and the council have indicated they will not pursue a civil claim against Randall. Randall pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud by false representation on various dates between May 2010 and July last year and three counts of making an article for use in fraud on various dates between April 2010 and July last year.","Howard Randall claimed benefits on a vacant flat in Belgravia, London .

A 13-year-old girl, who had pioneering artificial heart surgery which caused her to carry a battery for her heart pump in a purse wired to her chest, has successfully received a heart transplant. Kyah DeSimone from Hyannis, Massachusetts, received the long-awaited transplant on Saturday. She was previously kept alive with a heart pump powered by a battery she carried in her purse.

At the time, the small metal device wasn't approved for children but doctors asked for an emergency exemption, saying they had no choice. Dr. Christina VanderPluym, a pediatric cardiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, said: 'In the past, we would just allow these kids to pass peacefully.

A married couple who agreed to sell their £500,000 family home after they were made an offer they couldn't refuse are furious the new owners have knocked it down despite not having planning permission. Peter and Jennifer Watt had lived in the three-storey house in Grimsby for 16 years and had no intention of moving. But after putting attached land which has planning permission for two homes on the market with Scotts Properties, a buyer offered to pay over-market value for the whole site. A loved home: Peter and Jennifer Watt sold their house believing the new owners wanted to live in the property . Believing the new owners were keen to move into their beloved home, Mr and Mrs Watt agreed and left within a week of the deal. But on March 15 - just two weeks later - huge JCBs moved onto the site and demolished the house that had been there since the 1970s. Powerless neighbours watched in shock as the machines tore the house down, in a scene they compared to the helicopter attack in cult film 'Apocalypse Now'. North East Lincolnshire Council has confirmed it was done without planning permission, destroying all trees on the site, including one ash subject to a Tree Preservation Order. An investigation has been launched. Gone: Two weeks after Mr and Mrs Watt closed the deal JCBs moved in a knocked down their cherished home .

Equipment was seen pulling rubble away leaving behind nothing but the chimney stump and a few tree twigs. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, saw curtains, still attached to window panes and on poles, flapping. Carpets, fridges and an oven left in good will by the Watts were also ripped out.

Hunger strike: Albrecht Muth is accused of strangling and beating to death his 91-year-old wife, Viola Drath, in 2011. He also claims to be a former general in the Iraqi army . The trial of a German expat accused of killing . his much-older socialite wife has ground to a standstill after he went on hunger strike in his mental asylum cell blaming Iranian hitmen for her murder. It's the latest twist in the case against Albrecht Muth, a German expatriate whose behavior has ranged from odd to obstructive since he was charged with  strangling and beating to death his 91-year-old wife, Viola Drath. Muth, nearly a half-century younger than his late wife, has argued unsuccessfully for the right to wear what he said was an Iraqi military uniform in court. He fired his public defenders - only to have them reappointed after he was deemed too physically weak to act as his own lawyer. He told the judge he'd follow his own rules and he's name-dropped Jesus, David Petraeus and others in court proceedings. Muth's self-starving prompted a judge to . indefinitely postpone the trial, scheduled to start this Monday, after a . doctor said Muth was too weak to be brought to court and prosecutors . and defense lawyers said it wasn't feasible for him to participate . remotely from his hospital bed. His starvation, which he claims is for . religious reasons, has been the biggest roadblock yet in the strange . case that's included his claims that he was a general in the Iraqi army . and that the killing was an Iranian hit job. Muth began fasting after he . was ruled competent to stand trial in December. Frustrated prosecutors say Muth, 48, is orchestrating his own unavailability and thwarting their efforts to hold him accountable in the August 2011 slaying, and an exasperated judge says the case was in 'limbo status' until at least next month. Muth's behavior has defied an easy solution: His presence in the courtroom could harm his health and disrupt the proceedings, but his absence could set up an appeal on grounds that the trial was improperly held. The parties are right to proceed . cautiously since a trial without the defendant is an option 'reserved . for the most bizarre, unheard of collection of circumstances that . essentially result in a perfect storm,' said Bernie Grimm, a Washington . criminal defense lawyer not involved in the case. 'When . a defendant's not there, it's just a hornet's nest for the judge,' he . said, adding that a hastily made decision could raise all sorts of bases . for an appeal. Other . options have been debated. Prosecutor Glenn Kirschner suggested at one . point that he might seek a court order to force-feed the defendant, but . he's acknowledged that that Muth - who's been hospitalized for two . months - might be too ill for that. Killed: Viola Drath was found dead, stabbed and beaten, at her home in Washington . Superior Court Judge Russell Canan also considered having Muth appear via video link. But Kirschner argued that Muth could 'very well die on camera, on a two-way video feed' before the jury. He said he saw no way for the trial to proceed as scheduled. 'It's not an approach that the . government is comfortable risking a trial, a criminal conviction and a . possible reversal on,' Kirschner said. The . investigation began after Muth reported finding 91-year-old Viola . Drath's beaten and stabbed body in the bathroom of the couple's row home . in chic Georgetown, where for years they hosted dinner parties for . notable Washingtonians. Police arrested Muth, who has . maintained his innocence, after finding no signs of forced entry to the . home and observing scratches on his body that suggested a physical . struggle. Chic home: The investigation began after Muth reported finding 91-year-old Viola Drath's beaten and stabbed body in the bathroom of the couple's home in chic Georgetown, where for years they hosted dinner parties for notable Washingtonians . He also aroused suspicion when he presented a document - which prosecutors say was forged - stating that he was entitled to a portion of her estate upon her death. In truth, he had been removed from her will, authorities say. Drath, who contributed columns to The Washington Times and wrote on German affairs, wed Muth in 1990. The couple's tumultuous relationship included his prior conviction for beating her, and prosecutors say he leeched onto Drath's social connections to pass them off as his own. He walked the neighborhood smoking cigars and sporting a military-style uniform that prosecutors say was actually made for him in South Carolina. He showed off a military certificate that came from a Maryland print shop. Important voice: Drath, who contributed columns to The Washington Times and wrote on German affairs, wed Muth in 1990 . Despite his grandiose claims, he lived off a monthly allowance from Drath, had no connection to the Iraqi army or any income of his own, prosecutors say. Though defendants are entitled to attend every step of their trial, courts in recent years have grappled with where to draw the line on intentionally disruptive behavior. In Muth's case, a judge has scheduled a hearing for April. It's not clear whether anything will be different. Muth has dropped about 30 pounds in the hospital since his fast began and his organs are failing, said Dr. Russom Ghebrai. He did eat and drink last weekend - and has consumed food intermittently in the last few weeks - but then chastised himself for disobeying the orders of the archangel Gabriel and pledged to begin his fast anew. He's shown no signs he intends to permanently resume eating, telling Canan last week that if forced to choose between a jury of 'secular-ites' and his own religious convictions, it was an easy decision: 'I opt for God.'","Albrecht Muth accused of murdering Viola Drath in Washington home in 2011 .

Mance poses with a silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He was arrested with teammate Stephen Newbold after Tallahassee police were alerted to a shooting at an off-campus student apartment . Arrested: Newbold, the MVP at the recent Atlantic Coast Conference indoor track and field championships, is accused of firing a weapon in public and running from police . 'The students have been suspended from the team effective immediately,' athletic director Randy Spetman said. 'Whether they can return as student-athletes will be determined through our discipline policy and any legal proceedings.' The university also updated an online advisory it uses to inform its students, faculty and staff about such incidents with a report of the shooting, spokesman Keith Bromery said. Newbold, 20, won gold at the 2011 World Youth Games in the 200-meter dash in a career-best 20.89 and established a personal-best 47.12 in the 400-meter dash last spring in his hometown of Nassau, Bahamas. Mance has a personal best of 44.83 in the 400 meters. Newbold initially ran away from two pursuing officers, but was soon located by a police dog, according to the probable cause affidavit.

The affidavit said Newbold was arrested for discharging a firearm in public and resisting without violence. Mance was arrested for unauthorized use of an ID and resisting without violence. He had Newbold's ID which had an altered date on it, which is a third degree felony under Florida law. Tallahassee police spokesman David Northway said resisting without violence is a misdemeanor. Newbold told police that Mance was using the card to get into a local bar. One witness told police that she heard two gunshots and when she looked out of her window she saw a male, who was later identified as Newbold, shoot a hand gun two more times in the direction of the swimming pool. The witness said she heard the shots and saw the muzzle flashes each time. Fake ID: Mance (center) is accused of using an altered ID, which he had on him when he was arrested.

The widow of the pizza delivery man who was killed by a ex-convict who was accidentally released early from prison four years early is furious with authorities for dismissing his death as a 'clerical error.' Police believe that Evan Spencer Ebel killed Domino's Pizza delivery man Nathan Leon in Denver just days before he killed Colorado prison chief Tom Clements. Leon's widow said that the impersonal apology from the state- that Leon's family only heard about through the media - wouldn't cut it for the death of her husband and the father of her twin girls. Victim: Nathan Leon, left, was shot by Evan Spencer Ebel, a convict that was accidentally released early from prison and now Leon's widow Katherine (right) is speaking out for the first time . Heartbroken: Mrs Leon said that she doesn't know what to tell her twin daughters who lost their father because of a 'clerical error' that let a felon go free far too early . Happier days: Katherine and Nathan Leon, seen here on their wedding day, have twin girls who are 4-years-old . 'It ain't going to bring Tom Clements . back. It's not going to bring my children's father back. How do I tell . my 4-year-olds, ""Daddy was murdered because of a clerical error""? Katherine Leon said. Worrying: Officials said that Evan Spencer Ebel, pictured, was released from jail in January four years early . Officials said yesterday that Ebel's previous felony conviction had been inaccurately recorded and his release in January was a mistake. In 2008, Ebel pleaded guilty to . assaulting a prison officer. As part of the plea deal, Ebel was to be . sentenced to up to four additional years in prison, to be served after . he completed the eight-year sentence that put him behind bars in 2005, . according to a statement from Colorado's 11th Judicial District. However, the judge did not say the sentence was meant to be 'consecutive,' or in addition to, Ebel's current one. So . the court clerk recorded it as one to be served 'concurrently' or at . the same time. That's the information that went to the state prisons, . the statement said. On January 28, prisons officials saw . that Ebel had finished his court-ordered sentence and released him. They . said they had no way of knowing the plea deal was intended to keep Ebel . behind bars for years longer. On March 21, Ebel was killed following . a  shootout with authorities in Texas. The gun he used in the gun battle . was the same one used to shoot and kill Mr Clements two days earlier. Victims: Police believe Ebel also was involved in the death of a Domino's Pizza delivery man, Nathan Leon, left, in Denver. Prisons chief Tom Clements  right, was also believed to have been killed by Ebel . Irate: An emotional Mrs Leon said that she never even received a phone call of condolence from the Department of Corrections . 'The court regrets this oversight and . extends condolences to the families of Mr. Nathan Leon and Mr. Tom . Clements,' said a statement signed by Charles Barton, chief judge of the . 11th Judicial District, and court administrator Walter Blair. The statement, which Mrs Leon says they never were given directly, does not assuage any of their anger over the situation. Injured: Evan Spencer Ebel was first pulled over by Montague County Sheriff's Deputy James Boyd, pictured, before he was shot by police in the Texas shootout . 'We want to know who is going to . stand up and be accountable. I don't mean by saying we send condolences. Who is going to stand up and be accountable to my daughter? To my . grandchildren,' her mother and Nathan's mother-in-law told local station . 9News. 'He was the greatest person I ever had the pleasure of meeting,' widow Katherine Leon said. The court officials vowed to review their procedures to ensure the error isn't repeated. 'We commend both the 11th Judicial District and the DOC for . reviewing their own internal processes and procedures,' Governor John . Hickenlooper's spokeswoman Megan Castle said in a written statement. The attack that led to the plea deal took place in 2006. According to prison and court records, Ebel slipped out of handcuffs while being transferred from a cell and punched a prison officer in the face. He bloodied the officer's nose and finger, and threatened to kill the officer's family. 'If Mr. Ebel was prosecuted for an assault on an officer, it had to be pretty severe, because in the course of day-to-day work, correctional officers are regularly assaulted or threatened,' said Pueblo County Commissioner Buffie McFadyen, who is executive director of the correctional officer group Corrections U.S.A. Death: This picture shows the scene of the crash and shootout which killed Evan Spencer Ebel . Father and son: Jack Ebel, pictured with his . son, raised Evan Ebel in a middle-class Denver suburb. However, Evan . fell into crime despite his efforts to put him on the straight and . narrow . Shattered family: Clements is survived by his wife, Lisa, far right, and two daughters . Gunned down on his own doorstep: Tom Clements, executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, lived near Monument, Colorado, pictured above, and was killed at the door . 'It sounds like a horrific . oversight,' she said of the mistake that led to Ebel's release this . year. 'It's a tragic clerical error.' Ebel . spent much of his time behind bars in solitary confinement and had a . long record of disciplinary violations. Records show he joined a white . supremacist prison gang. Ebel's . early release was just the latest twist in a case full of painful . ironies. His father is friends with Hickenlooper and had testified . before the Colorado Legislature about the damage solitary confinement . did to his son. Clements was worried about that very issue. Hickenlooper . raised the case with Clements when the governor hired him to come to . Colorado in 2011.

One of France's most popular reality television programmes has had its latest season cancelled after a contestant died on the first day of filming. Koh-Lanta, the French version of Survivor, was filming its 16th season on a Cambodian island when Gérald Babin fell ill during a tug-of-war task with other contestants. The 25-year-old was airlifted to a nearby hospital but suffered a series of heart attacks on the way and was later pronounced dead. The tragic incident on Friday came at the very start of a planned five-month stay on the island of Koh Rong. Contestants had jumped from a boat and were taking part in a tug-of-war contest when Mr Babin started to complain about cramps in his arms. Doctors examined him on the set and decided he should be taken to hospital on the mainland town of Sihanoukville. After he suffered from multiple cardiac arrests on the helicopter journey, hospital doctors were unable to save his life. Adventure Line Productions, which produces the programme, said that Mr Babin had undergone a medical examination before being accepted as a contestant. Broadcaster TF1 said in a statement: 'The whole team from ALP and TF1, plus [presenter] Denis Brogniart, are devastated and share in the deep sadness of Gérald's family. 'All their thoughts are with his parents, sister, wife and friends.' Hit: A previous season of Koh-Lanta, one of the most popular reality TV shows in France . The companies immediately decided to suspend filming and cancel the show's current season, and the cast and crew have now returned to France. Cambodia's tourism minister said that Mr Babin's family have travelled to the country to repatriate his body. Koh-Lanta has been running on TF1 since 2001, and averaged 7.4million viewers in its latest season. It is a spin-off of Survivor, which was invented by British producer Charlie Parsons and first appeared on TV in Sweden in 1997. Tough: But all contestants are required to undergo health checks before the start of filming . The show involves 'castaways' on a remote island working together to build a camp, with the contestants nominating one person to be evicted each week. There have been dozens of different versions of Survivor - in the U.S., the 26th season is currently airing on CBS. The UK is one of the few countries where the reality contest was not a big hit, being cancelled after its second season in 2002 and replaced with I'm a Celebrity...

A weekly diabetes jab has been approved for use on the NHS - replacing the need for twice-a-day injections. Doctors can start prescribing Bydureon immediately to the 2.5million type 2 diabetes sufferers nationwide. It could spell the end of sufferers having to inject themselves with exenatide twice a day, the Daily Express reported. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence yesterday provisionally approved the £19-per-week jab for use on the NHS. Although Primary Care Trusts are able to start issuing the drug immediately, it is not likely to be widely prescribed across the health service until after final guidance is published next February. Bydureon provides the first treatment for type 2 diabetes which can be administered just once a week. Cathy Moulton, Diabetes UK clinical . adviser, told the Daily Express: 'For people currently using exenatide, a . twice-daily injection, the possibility of being able to administer this . treatment once a week could hugely improve their quality of life.' Bydureon works in the same way as exenatide but is released much more slowly so the number . of injections needed is reduced dramatically. When blood sugar levels are high, the drug induces the pancreas to produce more insulin. This stops so much glucose being produced and released into the bloodstream. Type 2 diabetes often hits people aged over 40. The number of sufferers is expected to rise significantly in the coming years because of unhealthy diets. Gila monster: Drug replicates hormone found in the Mexican lizard . It can be treated through injections along with a healthy diet and exercise. Bydureon works by recreating a hormone found in the Gila Monster lizard which limits the amount of sugar in the blood. The reptile, found in Mexico, eats just four meals per year but digests them very slowly. An estimated 850,000 people in Britain have type 2 diabetes which has not been diagnosed. Around a quarter of people given the once a week Bydureon injections suffer from nausea as a side effect. Professor Carole Longson, health technology evaluation centre director at Nice said: 'Type 2 diabetes is becoming increasingly more common in adults, so we are pleased to recommend exenatide as a treatment option for some people with the condition. 'These draft recommendations are now available for public consultation, and the manufacturer and other consultees have the opportunity to respond to concerns and comments made by the Appraisal Committee.'",£19-a-week treatment to be available on NHS .
"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 04:58 EST, 2 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:14 EST, 2 April 2013 . More than four fifths of American teenagers are at risk from heart disease thanks to their unhealthy diets, a study has revealed. While young people may not believe that their current lifestyle will have a long-term impact on their health, researchers say that there is a strong link between childhood behaviour and the long-term outlook for people's hearts. And more than 80 per cent are classified as having 'poor' diets, with just one in hundred eating the recommended level of healthy foods. Long-term: Childhood behaviour can have an effect on adult health, according to researchers (file photo) The study by the American Heart Association was aimed at identifying young people who might be in danger of developing heart problems. It tested 4,673 Americans between the ages of 12 and 19 for their blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, blood glucose, diet, exercise levels and smoking habits. Healthy diet proved by far the most worrying category, with the vast majority of subjects eating a poor mix of food groups. Scientists recommend eating at least 4.5 cups of fruit of vegetable a day, as well at 3oz of whole grain and no more than 1,500mg. Across the course of a week, young people should have at least two servings of fish and no more than 450 calories of sugary drinks - but only one per cent manage to fulfil all those conditions. Danger: The vast majority of teenagers prefer fast food to healthy snacks . Christina Shay, a researcher at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center who is lead author of the AHA study, described the findings on diet as 'far less than optimal'. She added that the U.S.'s youth obesity epidemic is 'influencing worsening rates of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and blood glucose at these young ages'. The situation is less dire when it comes to teenagers' exercise, but it is still worrying as just 67 per cent of boys and 44 per cent of girls engage in recommended levels of physical activity. And the toll of unhealthy lifestyles is already showing on adolescents, as a third have cholesterol levels rated as intermediate or poor. Overall, fewer than half of those in the study reached acceptable levels in at least five of the seven risk factors. Although nearly all children are born with hearts which are perfectly healthy, it can take just a few years for an unhealthy lifestyle to manifest itself in the body. The researchers write in the study, published in the journal Circulation, that autopsies conducted on children as young as six have for decades shown 'fatty streaks in the large arteries' as a result of poor diet. 'The status of heart health during childhood has been shown to be a strong predictor of heart health in adulthood,' Dr Shay concluded. 'Members of the medical and scientific community, parents, teachers and legislators all need to focus their efforts on the prevention and improvement of all aspects of cardiovascular health - particularly optimal physical activity levels and diet - as early in life as possible, beginning at birth.'","Childhood lifestyle can affect long-term heart health .

A midwife who opened Britain's only clinic for victims of female genital mutilation (FGM) has spoken in harrowing detail about the horrors inflicted upon her young patients. Comfort Momoh, 50, originally from Nigeria, opened the African Well Women's Clinic at London's St Thomas' Hospital in 1997, and treats up to 350 women for 'reversal procedures' each year, despite FGM being illegal in the UK since 1985. 'I have young people saying to me: . ""Comfort, can you put my clitoris back?"" And they get angry when I tell . them what has been removed can't be returned,' Momoh told the Evening Standard on International Women's Day. Momoh: 16 years after her FGM clinic opened communities are finally talking about it 'which is fantastic' FGM is usually carried out on girls aged between five and 12, and Momoh says she performs surgery to reverse the closure of the vaginal opening on two women each week. The midwife says it is 'fantastic' that communities are finally talking about the issue of FGM, a practice associated with . religion and female oppression - and one actively encouraged by the victim's mothers . '90 per cent of the time'. Within certain communities female circumcision is deemed necessary to make a girl marriageable, and is often carried out . by a 'grandma' who has no anatomical knowledge . and sees it as 'an act of love' rather than something barbaric, reported the Standard. Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth and an increased risk of newborn deaths. There are four types of FGM - clidoridectomy, excision, infibulation and other - and adult women who have undergone mutilation type three or four can have desperately painful intercourse, and suffer anxiety and palpitations when their husbands want sex. Men can find it unpleasant, too, even suffering bruised penises. 'Some say to me it's like trying to penetrate a brick wall,' says Mamoh. Type one: Clitoridectomy . Partial or total removal of the clitoris and, in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris). Type two: Excision . Partial or total removal of the . clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia . majora (the lips that surround the vagina). Type three: Infibulation . Narrowing of the vaginal opening . through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting . and repositioning the inner, or outer, labia, with or without removal of . the clitoris. Type four: Other . All other harmful procedures to the . female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, . incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area. Pointless: 'No type of FGM has any health benefits, nor is it linked to religion' (picture posed by model) SOURCE: World Health Organisation . Momoh has discovered that parents keen for their daughters to be circumcised take them on 'summer holidays' to their ancestral homeland where they will be secretly cut. She is now campaigning for a police stall at Heathrow airport over the summer months, and wants carriers to help raise awareness of the law, 'but they think it's too culturally sensitive'. While almost 30 African countries practice FGM and most of Momoh's patients come from Somalia, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Eritrea, Sudan and Nigeria, they are far from an anomaly. The World Health Organisation stresses FGM has no health benefits and is a violation of the human rights of girls and women . In November, Observer journalist Abigail Haworth reported witnessing 248 girls suffer mutilation in just one day 'of celebration' in Indonesia. Haworth said: 'Although Indonesia is not a country where FGM is widely reported, the practice is endemic. 'Two nationwide studies carried out by population researchers in 2003 and 2010 found that between 86 and 100 per cent of households surveyed subjected their daughters to genital cutting, usually before the age of five. 'More than 90 per cent of adults said they wanted the practice to continue.' The World Health Organisation stresses FGM has no health benefits and is a violation of the human rights of girls and women. People who carry out or arrange female genital mutilation in the UK or abroad face up to 14 years in prison. Waris Dirie: 'FGM targets fragile angels who are helpless, who cannot fight back' Somali supermodel Waris Dirie backed a film highlighting the plight of young girls facing female genital mutilation in the UK, The Mail reported in July 2011 . She supported the project together with the Metropolitan Police to highlight the potentially fatal practice. Dirie, an FGM victim herself, said: 'Female genital mutilation targets little girls, baby girls - fragile angels who are helpless, who cannot fight back. 'It's a crime against a child, a crime against humanity. It's abuse. It's absolutely criminal and we have to stop it.' A film, Cut - Some Wounds Never Heal, was produced by schoolgirls in London as a free download for schools in the UK. Detective Sergeant Vicky Washington, from the Metropolitan Police, said: 'This is a hidden problem that affects thousands of children and young women in the UK. 'There are no legitimate cultural or religious reasons for female genital mutilation - it's child abuse.' The film was financed by the Metropolitan Police, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with the backing of the Home Office and the Department for Education. It was produced by Kids Taskforce, which specialises in child safety. Its president Sharon Doughty said: 'This is a practice that needs bringing out into the open so that it can be addressed - by working with communities here to change minds.'","Comfort Momoh, 50, is originally from Nigeria .

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 21:08 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:40 EST, 7 November 2012 . Justin Welby is tipped to be the next Archbishop of Canterbury . A former oil executive who was only made a bishop last year is expected to be named as the next Archbishop of Canterbury later this week. Rumours swept Westminster last night that Justin Welby, the Bishop of Durham, was on the verge of being appointed following a highly secretive selection process. One well-placed source said he was '98 per cent certain' to be confirmed in the job. A formal announcement naming the 105th head of the Church of England and leader of the 77 million-strong Anglican Communion is expected tomorrow or Friday. The Right Reverend Welby would represent a significant swing to the right for the Anglican church, following the controversial liberal stance of his predecessor Dr Rowan Williams. The Bishop of Durham, an Old Etonian who spent 11 years working in the oil industry, is a staunch opponent of gay marriage. He has supported for the ordination of women bishops, but proposed a mechanism to allow those opposed to the move to stay within the Communion. His appointment as head of the Church would represent an almost unprecedented rise. The 56-year-old was ordained in 1992 and was only appointed to the See of Durham, the Church's fourth most senior bishopric, in October last year. Bishop of London Richard Chartres and Bishop of Coventry Christopher Cocksworth were reportedly considered for the position . But his lack of experience at the top of the Church may have counted in his favour, since it means he has not been embroiled in the internal controversies that have engulfed it for the past decade. His experience as a former oil industry executive mean he is also seen as someone likely to be a good manager. Despite his corporate background, he has been a strong critic of the excesses of capitalism. Last month, he suggested that before the financial crisis banks had been serving 'no socially useful purpose' and were 'exponents of anarchy', calling for the financial industry to be 'rebuilt from the ruins'. If the church chooses Justin Welby it will be a considerable move to the right of his predecessor Dr Rowan Williams . The Bishop sits on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards looking into the ethics and practices in the City that led to the Libor lending rate scandal. The Crown Nominations Commission, a panel of four women and 15 men, are tasked with drawing up a list of two choices for the head of the Church - a frontrunner and a fall back option - which is presented to the Prime Minister and the Queen. The committee, which is led by the former Conservative MP Lord Luce, is thought to have considered candidates including the Bishop of London Richard Chartres and the Bishop of Coventry Christopher Cocksworth. Last night bookmakers Ladbrokes suspended betting on the Right Reverent Welby, following a flurry of bets on him to get the job. Downing Street and Lambeth Palace declined to comment.","Source says Justin Welby '98% certain' to be appointed .

But she says that  to stay at home or spend her time shopping 'would be a waste of a life'. The ambitious heiress, 28, decided to sink her teeth into a new business venture after tiring of being a stay-at-home mother to daughter Luna, now three, and stepped in to save her friend's ailing fashion business just in the nick of time. The Issa fashion brand had been a favourite of the Middleton sisters for years but when Kate wore one of their wrap dresses to announce her engagement the world went crazy for the Brazilian label and the small company couldn't cope. Camilla, friends with Issa founder and designer Daniella Helayal, decided to buy a majority stake in the company and is now spearheading their global expansion. Mohamed Al Fayed's fortune won't put daughter Camilla off of working . Camilla Al Fayed judges the 2013 Mr And Miss Liverpool contest at the Liverpool Olympia this week .

'Issa was basically run by interns, students and Daniella. There was no business model,' Al Fayed told the Times. It was when the company was on the brink of collapse in 2011 that Al Fayed stepped in to buy out a 51 per cent stake, effectively saving the brand which showed a stunning Navajo collection at London Fashion Week last month. The heiress might have no formal retail or . business training, but she has been schooled in style since childhood and understands what . sells and what women want from fashion. She said: 'I'm very much taught in the University of Harrods, and what better place? 'Harrods was my second home for four or five days a week when I left school. Kate Middleton stepped out in a sapphire £385 dress propelling Issa London to global levels of fame . Catherine has long been a fan of the Issa London label, wearing it regularly, especially for formal occasions . After hanging around at Harrods as a teenager Camilla headed to New York aged 18 where she assisted Anna Wintour at US Vogue in what was 'literally the Devil Wears Prada job'. 'It was an amazing experience, to live and work in New York, and [Anna Wintour] is an amazing woman. 'What better start to my fashion journey?' she said. Now, as chairman of Issa (whose fans . also include Madonna and Eva Mendes) Camilla is continuing her fashion journey by taking the brand global. She said: 'Japan is the gateway to Asia . and we intend to expand into Hong Kong and China within the next few . years. We will then become a truly global brand.' Having previously sold their wares only online or through department store concessions, Issa London will be opening a permanent outlet in Tokyo's Roppongi Hills shopping centre next month. The label hosted a pop-up store in Mitsukoshi department store in Ginza, a Tokyo district, last year so has already formed strong connections with the country. The fashion house is famed for its silky, wraparound styles. In . a statement Camilla added: 'The response was overwhelming and we knew . our formula was the right one for Japan.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 05:23 EST, 26 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:44 EST, 26 March 2013 . A woman has been cured of anorexia thanks to pioneering surgery that 'rewired' her brain. Kim Rollins, 36, was on the brink of death after suffering a heart attack, two strokes and broken bones since the onset of the eating disorder when she was 15. By her early twenties she weighed less than a seven-year-old child and could barely face eating half an apple a day. Kim Rollins (pictured with her mother, Jennifer, when she was 24) developed anorexia at 15 . Ms Rollins (pictured since her recovery) lost so much weight that she had a heart attack and two strokes . After all conventional treatment . programmes failed, Ms Rollins, from Ontario, Canada, was approached by experts researching . whether a technique called deep brain stimulation could be used to help patients such as her. The principle behind the surgery is to block  the abnormal nerve signals which trigger anorexic thoughts. Patients having DBS are fitted with a neurostimulator - a device similar to a heart pacemaker, which is connected to electrodes placed in certain parts of the brain. The electrical implant is connected to a small battery under the skin in the person’s chest or abdomen to generate small electrical signals to stimulate the brain. When switched on, the patient benefits from the blocking of abnormal nerve signals which trigger the disabling symptoms. The technique has also been successfully used to treat people with Parkinson's disease and chronic pain. Patients having the deep brain . stimulation surgery, as it is known, are fitted with a neurostimulator, a . device similar to a heart pacemaker, which is connected to electrodes . placed in certain parts of the brain. The electrical implant is connected . to a small battery under the skin in the person’s chest or abdomen to . generate small electrical signals to stimulate the brain. When the device is switched on, the abnormal nerve signals which trigger the symptoms of anorexia are blocked, reinforcing positive responses to food. Ms . Rollins said: ‘My health had been deteriorating for years because of . malnutrition and it got to the point where I was either going to die, or . give the surgery a shot. My family was terrified. ‘I was extremely scared going down to surgery, but I was more scared of dying from anorexia at that point. ‘In . the operating theatre, the surgeon put a divider on my forehead. I could . sense the neurosurgeons behind the plastic sheet working away . positioning electrodes on my brain while a psychiatrist calmly chatted . to me. ‘The . psychiatrist asked me a series of questions, some of them about food. When I responded in a positive way to a description of food, it . indicated the electrodes were in the right place. ‘It . was weird having someone poke around in my head while I was awake, but I . knew I was in the hands of some of the world's best brain surgeons and . so that took my mind off things.’ Once . the electrodes were correctly placed, Ms Rollins was sedated and . underwent a shorter operation which installed the pacemaker-like power . source into her chest. Two weeks later, the doctors who supervised her surgery at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre in Toronto, Canada, turned on the current which stimulated the electrodes in her brain, rewiring her thoughts towards food. She said: ‘When the pacemaker was . switched on, it was surreal how my thoughts towards food just changed, . as if someone had flicked a switch. ‘Suddenly the thought of eating a meal didn't fill me with anxiety or guilt.’ Ms Rollins experienced her first serious bout of anorexia at the age of 15. The electrodes stimulate the part of the brain responsible for depression, anxiety and obsessive thoughts . As . an adult she dropped to just five stone at her lowest points. Even . extended treatment at a 'boot camp' clinic in the Arizona desert when . she was 24 failed to change her attitude to food. Earlier this year, with her weight . stabilised at a healthy eight stone, a moment of triumph came when she . ate a piece of birthday cake at her nephew's birthday party. She . said: ‘For 20 years I'd sat at parties and watched everyone else eat . cake, while I always passed on the offer. Everyone would look at me in a . sad way when I kindly said no. ‘It . may seem silly, but saying yes and being able to eat a piece of cake . with the rest of my family was such an amazing feeling.’ She added: ‘Before, the thought alone of eating a chocolate and crisps made me ill. Now, I can eat these things without feeling guilty and I enjoy eating snacks. When Ms Rollins was 24 she attended a boot camp anorexia treatment programme in Arizona . ‘That's not to say I am turning into a chocoholic, and I'm careful about not overindulging, but having the freedom to have a chocolate treat or a bag of crisps is marvellous.' As part of Ms Rollin’s on going recovery from the surgery, which was carried out in January 2012, she sees a therapist and dietician who monitor her success and guide her in getting her life back. She said: ‘Being warped with anorexic thoughts made me lose touch of what to eat and what was good for me - it's almost like I had to learn how to eat again.’ Now Ms Rollins plans to make up for lost years and will soon begin studying for a Master’s degree in political science. She said: ‘I missed out on what should have been the best years of my youth but I am now getting my life back together. I can hang out with friends and eat meals together with them. ‘When I suffered from anorexia, I hated my body image, so it put me off having any relationships with men, but this is something I feel more confident about now. ‘I have no immediate plans or desires, but the idea of having a partner and possibly family isn't off the cards, so who knows what will happen in the future?’ In a recent trial six women aged between 24 and 57, who had been suffering from anorexia for between four and 37 years, were given the treatment. Researchers based at the Krembil . Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada used . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify a specific area of the . brain previously targeted in patients with depression. The target area was given stimulation and three months later, five of the six patients stabilised or gained weight. After . nine months, three patients were maintaining a higher weight than . before the treatment started - the longest period of sustained weight . gain any had achieved since their illness began. Ms Rollins underwent pioneering surgery to attach electrodes to her brain . Around half of the patients also experienced improvements in their mood or reduced obsessive-compulsive behaviour. Researcher Dr Andres Lozano, a leading neurosurgeon in the field, said it appeared to have a genuine effect on the illness. ‘The finding of improvements in mood and anxiety in patients who were still underweight is especially striking, in view of the well-known poor response of underweight patients to conventional pharmacotherapies or psychotherapies,’ he said. There are around 90,000 Britons with eating disorders including anorexia, which often start in the early teens. A record number of 1,600 people - mostly girls and women - were given hospital treatment for anorexia in 2011.","Kim Rollins, 36, suffered from severe anorexia since she was 15-years-old .

Thousands of people with kidney cancer that has spread are to be denied a new pill that could prolong their lives, claim doctors. Axitinib extends the lives of advanced kidney cancer sufferers by two months on average, according to trials. But the drug is the latest to face an NHS ban by the rationing watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). It has already axed another drug that could be used after treatment stops working and the cancer starts growing again. Banned: Axitinib extends the lives of advanced kidney cancer sufferers by two months on average, according to trials . Professor Tom Powles, consultant oncologist at Barts Health NHS Trust, London, said: ‘This is very bad news for the thousands of patients across England and wales who could benefit from treatment with axitinib. ‘What will it take for NICE to approve a treatment in this setting?’ Professor Powles said it was one of a new generation of drugs that cut off the blood supply to tumours which promise to extend life far more than trial data suggests. He said: ‘In the seven years since I started working in kidney cancer, average life expectancy has more than doubled from 12 months to 30 months because we can treat continuously with different drugs. ‘But restricting the drugs we can offer, particularly after first-line treatment has failed, means we are losing the benefits. Indeed it may mean we are wasting money on drugs at an earlier stage because we can’t provide maintenance therapy that gives patients a longer life and better quality of life.’ Axitinib, also known as Inlyta, targets molecules on tumour cells that help stimulate blood vessel growth. With their supply of oxygen and nutrients cut off, tumours eventually starve and die. Altogether 9,000 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer each year, including one-third which has spread because of lack of symptoms in the early stages. The average age is 55 years. Almost two in three might be eligible for the new drug when first-line treatments stop working. Broadcaster James Whale, chairman of the James Whale Fund for Kidney Cancer and a kidney cancer survivor, says the decision is unacceptable . However, a draft decision by NICE says axitinib is not a ‘cost effective use of limited NHS resources’ at around £3,000 a month. It previously banned everolimus for the same stage of the disease. Broadcaster James Whale, chairman of the James Whale Fund for Kidney Cancer and a kidney cancer survivor, said: ‘The James Whale Fund considers as unacceptable the decision by NICE not to approve axitinib as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced kidney cancer.’ Dr David Montgomery, medical director of the drug manufacturer Pfizer Oncology UK, said: ‘Pfizer is extremely disappointed and saddened by today’s decision. Pfizer has worked closely with NICE and done everything in its power to demonstrate the value axitinib brings to patients and address the questions about cost effectiveness raised by NICE. ‘We remain deeply committed to the field of kidney cancer and believe that Inlyta is an important treatment advance that represents good value to the NHS. We will continue to challenge this decision in the interests of patients.’","NICE says that the NHS should not provide axitinib .

This incredible picture shows a dying sun which has burst back to life for a final, doomed blaze of glory. The perishing star - which was once like our own Sun - has burst briefly back to life after casting gassy shells out into the surrounding space. The image of the planetary nebula Abell 30 is a composite of visible images from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and X-ray data from ESA’s XMM-Newton and NASA’s Chandra space telescopes. Abell 30: This born-again planetary nebula shows how our own Sun may one day look as it burns out . It is 5,500 light years from Earth, but mimics the possible fate our own solar system faces in a few billion years. 'Planetary . nebula' is the name given to the often-concentric shells of stellar . material cast into space by dying stars like this one. The intricate pattern of planetary nebula Abell 30 revealed in the picture above combines optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images with XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray data. In the main image a large spherical shell is seen in emission of hydrogen (blue) and oxygen (red) as the result of the star’s outer shell being stripped off by a dense wind and expanding outward over the last 12 500 years. During the ‘born-again’ phase in the star’s evolution, it expelled knots of helium and carbon-rich material. A subsequent fast wind is streaming past this material to form the flower-like structure seen in oxygen emission (red) to produce shock-heated gas seen in X-rays (purple). The inset panel zooms in to the heart of the planetary nebula to reveal intricate details closer to the star. The tail-like structures (orange) mark the dense knots of material from the ‘born-again’ event and are seen in HST images. X-ray emission from this evolutionary phase is shown in purple. To astronomers of the 18th century, these objects looked like the colourful ‘blob’ of a planet through their telescopes, and the name has stuck. Now scientists know that as a star with less than eight times the mass of the Sun swells into a red giant towards the end of its life, its outer layers are expelled via pulsations and winds. Ultraviolet radiation shining out from the stripped-down, but still hot stellar core then lights up the ejected shells, resulting in intricate artwork-like phenomena that can be seen by modern telescopes. A ‘homeless planet’ which floats through space without orbiting a star had been discovered for the first time. Scientists have speculated on the existence of such a planet and have been trawling the night skies for more than a decade, although the hunt was described as looking for a ‘needle in a thousand haystacks’. The isolated planet, shown below in an artist's impression, which astronomers believe may have been flung away during its formation, is not tied by gravity to a star and in 100 light years away. The star at the heart of Abell 30 . experienced its first brush with death 12,500 years ago – as seen from . Earth – when its outer shell was stripped off by a slow and dense . stellar wind. Optical telescopes see the remnant of this evolutionary stage as a large, near-spherical shell of glowing material expanding out into space. Then, about 850 years ago, the star suddenly came back to life, violently coughing out knots of helium and carbon-rich material. The star’s outer envelope briefly expanded during this born-again episode, but then very rapidly contracted again within 20 years. This had the knock-on effect of accelerating the wind from the star to its present speed of 4,000 kilometres per second – over 14million kilometres per hour (8.7million miles per hour). As this fast stellar wind catches up and interacts with the slower wind and clumps of previously ejected material, complex structures are formed, including the delicate comet-like tails seen near the star in the centre of this image. The stellar wind bombarding these dense clumps of material provides a chilling look at the possible fate of Earth and its fellow planets in our own solar system in a few billion years’ time. When our Sun emits its final gasps of life at the heart of a planetary nebula, its strong stellar wind and harsh radiation will blast and evaporate any planets that may have survived the red giant phase of stellar evolution. If any distant civilisation is watching with high-power telescopes at the time, they might see the glowing embers of the planets light up in X-rays as they are engulfed in the stellar wind.","Planetary nebula Abell 30 has burst briefly back into life after casting gassy shells out into surrounding space .

Middle-aged men who physically act out their dreams while asleep are five times more likely to develop dementia, researchers have found. Moving around, walking, talking or hitting out while asleep is the strongest predictor that a man will develop dementia with Lewy bodies – the second most common form of dementia in the elderly after Alzheimer's. Another example would be unconsciously mimicking the action of holding a steering wheel while dreaming about driving a car. Physically acting out dreams is a condition known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. Middle-aged men who acts out their dreams while asleep are five times more likely to develop dementia in old age . Researchers at the Mayo Clinic, in . the U.S., found that men with the condition are five times more likely . to develop this form of dementia than those who display other risk factors currently used to make the diagnosis, such as hallucinations. REM sleep is the phase of sleep during which the most vivid dreams occur, while  REM sleep behaviour disorder is the name given to the condition that causes the loss of the normal muscle paralysis that occurs during REM sleep. This precursor can appear as much as three decades or more before a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is made, the researchers said. This type of dementia accounts for ten per cent of all cases in the elderly. For most people, dreams occur purely in the mind while the body is resting. However, people who suffer from REM sleep behaviour disorder physically act out their dreams while they are asleep. They physically move around, walk, talk or hit out in their sleep. It is often not diagnosed until it starts to prove a danger to the sufferer's bed partner. Studies of animals suggest that the symptoms of REM sleep behaviour . disorder may be caused by lesions on the brain stem (the area of the . brain which joins the spinal cord). The disorder can be treated quite successfully  using medications such as antidepressants.. However, the link between dementia with Lewy bodies and the sleep disorder is not as strong in women, they added. Researchers at Mayo Clinic in . Minnesota and Florida examined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of . the brains of 75 patients diagnosed with probable dementia with Lewy . bodies. The . researchers then checked the patients' histories to see if the sleep . disorder had been diagnosed in them while they were under Mayo care. ‘While it is, of course, true that not everyone who has this sleep disorder develops dementia with Lewy bodies, as many as 75 to 80 per cent of men with dementia with Lewy bodies in our Mayo database did experience REM sleep behaviour disorder,' said lead investigator Dr Melissa Murray, a neuroscientist at Mayo Clinic. 'So it is a very powerful marker for the disease.' She added that the study's findings could improve the diagnosis of this form of dementia and that this can lead to better treatment. ‘Screening for the sleep disorder in a patient with dementia could help clinicians diagnose whether they are suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer's disease,’ she says. ‘It can sometimes be very difficult to tell the difference between these two dementias, especially in the early stages, but we have found that only two to three per cent of patients with Alzheimer's disease have a history of this sleep disorder.’ Once the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is made, patients can use drugs that can treat the related cognitive issues, Dr Murray says. No cure is currently available. Dementia with Lewy bodies affects men and women equally and is most prevalent in the over 65s. Red areas on a brain scan are a warning of Alzheimer's disease. Green areas are healthy brain . Lewy bodies, named after the doctor who discovered them, are small spherical protein deposits found in nerve cells. Their presence in the brain interferes with the normal functioning of the brain – it is yet to be established why they occur in the brain and how they cause damage. Dementia with Lewy bodies is a degenerative disease with symptoms including problems with alertness, spatial disorientation, difficulty planning ahead and memory problems. People with this form of dementia sometimes also develop symptoms including slowness, muscle stiffness, trembling of the limbs, a tendency to shuffle when walking, loss of facial expression, and changes in the strength and tone of the voice. The research comes just after another study which found that disrupted sleep could be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at Washington University found that people with early stage Alzheimer's often suffer disrupted sleep before they display other symptoms of the condition.","Physically acting out dreams is best predictor of common type of dementia .

As Hitman: Absolution's release draws ever closer, MailOnline caught up with the game's star, David Bateson - the long-standing voice of Agent 47. Is it the darkest Hitman game yet? Bateson: 'You know what, I think they’re all pretty dark. I haven’t seen the whole game, but yes, it’s fair to say that the darkness of it, the element of suspense, fear, death and destruction is the worst...or the best.' Legend: Agent 47 is one of the most recognisable characters in video games . How has the character evolved since you have played him? Bateson: 'I think the history and the back story of his creation has been developed more and I think it has also evolved. 'I don’t even know to what extent the creators had worked it through from start to end or whether they’d gone from one game to the next, but I definitely think this game has a much more personal human element to it. 'I thought Blood Money really was pushing it with advancing that human element with his relationship with Diana, however this one takes it to the next level.' Do you feel like Agent 47 has any weaknesses and are these explored in Absolution? Bateson: 'Weaknesses, well maybe killing people! You know, I don’t know. 'I’d say his only weakness may be that he might sometimes get a bit curious as to how he goes about killing someone or where that level could lead him to. 'But then a weakness in this game might be his evolving relationship with one of the characters.' Looks that kill: Absolution is the most graphically accomplished Hitman yet .

From battling for naval supremacy, to liberating Boston and New York, Assassin's Creed 3 is by far the most ambitious game of the series. Indeed, there is so much to do in the vast, open-world playground in Ubisoft’s latest Assassin’s outing that it’s easy to get side-tracked from the ever-changing, and sometimes complex, narrative. Hiding in the shadows: But there is more emphasis on action in AC3 . Thankfully, AC3’s story is wonderful, putting you in the middle of some of the most important events of the American Revolution. The opening hour, in particular, is one of the strongest beginnings of recent times – where cutting-edge graphics and strong voice acting merge to create a living, breathing world. For most of the game, you play native American assassin, Connor. It’s impossible to reveal the story without giving away the plot, however, there are plenty of twists and unexpected surprises. Gameplay is a familiar recipe, involving gathering information, stalking and killing high-profile targets. This is made all the more fun by the drastically improved free-running and combat. From scaling houses to climbing snow-covered trees, it’s never been easier to pull-off daring acrobatic feats. The Animus, too, is clearer, showing when Connor is hidden from sight or if objects can be interacted with. Combat revolves around a simple parry and counter system, but as seen in the recent Batman games, it’s a brilliant mechanic if executed well. Box of tricks: There are plenty of weapons for Connor to experiment with . Although not as interactive as many would hope (a button press will trigger a pre-set animated counter) it’s visually very rewarding to take down a group of guards during a mass brawl. At its heart, though, this is a stealth game, and most of the time, AC3 encourages you to remain incognito for as long as possible. There are plenty of stealth kills that can be performed from the shadows, and bodies can be hidden to avoid detection. There are also fantastic naval missions which, coupled with the well-rendered water and authentic ship dynamics, are incredibly entertaining and exciting to play. They help to emphasise the scale of the conflict, while providing a welcome break from the more familiar gameplay. Indeed, it is times like this – where the game keeps nothing hidden away – where AC3 is at its best. It is when you’re allowed to explore the world and feature in iconic, large-scale battles that you appreciate how carefully Ubisoft have recreated the period. Unfortunately, there are some areas where AC3 comes up short. Technically, although artistically strong and well thought-out, the game is a victim of its own scale. Stalk of the town: It pays to be incognito most of the time . Pop up, bland textures and frame-rate drops constantly interfere with the Anvil Next engine, while the long loading times can wrench you away from the otherwise immersive experience. But look beyond the glitches and it’s clear AC3 is a beautiful game, one that has perhaps reached the frontiers of what the straining current-gen consoles can achieve. Interestingly, the single-player mechanics transfer to the multiplayer very well. The Wolf Pack mode is good fun, allowing you to work with a friend to take down NPC targets in a score attack. While Assassinate seamlessly blends guile and violence, and sees you kill other human players whist trying to stay hidden for as long as possible. However impressive, though, it is the single-player campaign which is the star here. A story that is every bit as beautiful as it is deadly, and one that like its leading man, deserves to carve its place in history.

Still standing and still in every-day use - the arched wooden bridges built in China nearly 1,000 years ago demonstrate the true skill of the master craftsmen who first constructed them. These stunning structures show how not every part of China has been altered by its remarkable rate of development. The bridges, suspended between two banks of lush greenery and built from the wood of the trees surrounding them, are still a fully functional part of life in the Fuijan and Zhejiang provinces along China's south east coast. Still in use: A man walks across the Yangmeizhou timber arch lounge bridge, in the Kengdi village of Shouning County, which was built during the Ming Dynasty . Amazing structures: The Yangmeizhou bridge, right, and the Luanfeng bridge, left are both prime examples of the 'beam-weaving' bridge building method where horizontal 'beams' are supported by piers at each end . Protected: The bridges, including the Yangmeizhou bridge pictured, have been listed as one of the state's key cultural relics . Of the 100 woven arched timber 'lounge bridges' in China, 19 of them are in the Shouning County of the Fujian province alone - including the Luanfeng bridge, in the village of Xiadang, and the Yangmeizhou bridge, in nearby Kengdi. The Qiancheng bridge meanwhile, in the Tangkou village, in Fuzhou, also in the Fujian province is even older, having been built during the Southern Song Dynasty which lasted from 1127 to 1279. Again the bridge, which is an impressive 62.7 metres long and 4.9 metres wide, has been rebuilt several times, but remains an iconic image of ancient Chinese construction methods. Both of the bridges have been listed as one of the state's key cultural relics, while the UNESCO website has said the traditional methods for building the bridges on China's south east coast, has declined in recent years because of the country's rapid urbanisation. The building of the bridges relies on a skilled craftsmanship, with a woodworking master directing the carpentry of a team of woodworkers. Idyllic: The Luanfeng Bridge, a timber arch lounge bridge, in the Xiadang village in south east China . Still standing: The Qiancheng Bridge, in the village of Tangkou, which was built during the Southern Song Dynasty, which began in 1127 . This craftsmanship has been passed on down the years from one generation to another by masters teaching apprentices or relatives within a clan following strict procedures. The clans then play a vital role in the building, maintenance and protection of the bridges. The historical bridges also play an important role within the cultural life of the areas they have been built in, providing meeting places for residents to exchange information, worship and entertain. Reaching over time: The Yangmeizhou Bridge is 47.6 meters long and 4.9 meters wide . Throughout the years: The skills and knowledge needed to maintain the bridges has been passed on through the generations . The bridges, included on UNESCO's National List of Intangible Cultural Heritage, are built entirely by hand using the skill of 'beam-weaving' and creating mortise and tenon joints. The woodworking masters design the bridges with a range of arches depending on the surroundings, while the passageways can be of various styles, depending on the use of the bridge. To create arch support, 'beam weaving' is used which sees three rows of wood formed into an arch-supporting system while in the upper layer five shorter rows of wood are jointed and intertwined with upper-arch supports. Wood that then connects the whole bridge is placed at the joints between the ends so the bridge becomes a solid whole. Traditional tools such as Lu Ban rulers, sawhorses, axes and chisels were used in the construction of the bridges. A glimpse into the past: The bridges offer us a peak into the China of years gone by, while still managing to serve the country in the modern day .","Remarkable images of bridges built nearly 1,000 years ago and still in use .

An 'irrational' landlord tried to electrocute his lodger with a booby-trap after an argument over his tenant's satellite TV subscription. Eric Malcolm, from Royston, Hertfordshire, wrapped a live 240-volt extension cable round his living room door handle in a bid to electrocute Tony Gilesnan, before hitting the tenant over the head with a hammer. Mr Gilesnan, who had only been living with Malcolm for three days, received only a mild shock from the handle, but was left with a three-inch gash on the head after the hammer blow. The pair had rowed about a Sky TV package in the property before Malcolm, 33, carried out the attack, which a court heard 'could have killed' Mr Gilesnan. Cambridge Crown Court heard that after seeing lodger Mr Gilesnan receive only a small shock, Malcolm told him: 'You should be on the floor with the 240 volts I had put through you. The court heard evidence from an . electrician confirming that, if Malcolm had set up the trap properly, it . could have seriously injured or killed Mr Gilesnan. Malcolm had previously pleaded guilty to administering a noxious substance to Mr Gilesnan, namely 240 volts of electricity, so as to endanger his life, and also admitted grievous bodily harm. Row: Mr Malcolm and Mr Gilesnan had argued over the property's satellite TV package . The court was told the pair had set up a tenancy agreement and Mr Gilesnan had put down three months' rent and a deposit totalling £1,200 before they disagreed about their satellite TV. The row was resolved but later escalated again when Malcolm wrongly thought his tenant had used his computer and broken one of his trophies. It was after this new row that Malcolm went downstairs in the property and set up the trap, with Mr Gilesnan following shortly after. Rebecca Smith, prosecuting, said Mr . Gilesnan felt a 'tingle' as he touched the door handle before entering . the room, and then 'felt a sharp blow to the back of his head. 'He turned and saw that he had had a hammer in his hand,' she told the court. After . a struggle Mr Gilesnan managed to grab the weapon and called the . emergency services. He suffered a three-inch cut to his head after the . attack on April 28 this year.

The team behind the world's solar powered plane that can fly by night are planning their most ambitious adventure yet - to circumnavigate the globe in 20 days and nights without a drop of fuel. The Solar Impulse currently holds the record for the longest flight by a manned solar-powered plane, staying in the skies 30,000 ft above Switzerland for more than 26 hours. Created by Swiss adventurers Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, it flies using four propeller engines powered by 12,000 solar cells attached to vast wings. Scroll down to see Solar Impulse in action . Record breaker: The Solar Impulse currently holds the record for the longest flight by a manned solar-powered plane, staying in the skies 30,000 ft above Switzerland for more than 26 hours . It is not the first plane to be powered solely by the light of the sun, but it is the first to be able to continue its flight even after night has fallen - all the way until the dawn. It collects so much energy from the sun during the day that it can store electricity to power it through the night. Earlier this year it completed a 1,550-mile voyage across Europe to North Africa in three steps, but its creators believe its radical design could allow it to fly forever. High tech: Made from lightweight materials, the Solar Impulse has a wingspan to match a jumbo yet weighs only as much as a small car . For the solar cells which power the the engines of Solar Impulse are not just attached to its wings - they are its wings. Mr Piccard told CBS News how the solar cell wings convert light directly to electricity. 'And then this electricity goes simultaneously to the engines and to the batteries and then we will reach the next sunrise and capture the sun again,' he said. 'And we can continue theoretically forever.' Constructed from lightweight materials, the Solar Impulse has a wingspan to match a jumbo jet yet weighs only as much as a small car. The plane's wings are covered with solar panels housing thousands of cells designed to collect the energy of the sun's rays and power four electric motors driving wing-mounted propellers. Mr Piccard could be said to have adventure in the blood. His grandfather Auguste set an altitude record, and is perhaps the first person to have seen the curvature of the Earth. His father Jacques went the other way, plunging in a bathyscape to the bottom of Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the deepest location of the Earth's crust. 'That was really impressive for me as a kid because I was reading in the history books all the stories about the Earth being flat, being round or whatever,' he told CBS. 'And my grandfather came back and said, ""I saw the curvature of the Earth with my eyes."" So once you live this as a kid, of course, you want to continue into that field of exploration.' Ambitious: Bertrand Piccard, left, Andre Borschberg celebrate after successfully landing the solar-powered HB-SIA prototype airplane after its first successful night flight attempt in 2010 . And Piccard clan's latest adventurer has not been slow off the mark, already winning the first trans-Atlantic balloon race and becoming the first person to complete a nonstop balloon flight around the globe. It was after nearly running out of fuel and crash landing in the Egyptian desert on that latter escapade Mr Piccard dreamed up the idea of circling the globe in an aircraft that needed no fuel. 'It was almost a failure due to the dependency on fuel and on that day I made a promise,' he said. 'I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world it would be with no fuel at all.' Although the goal is to show that emissions-free air travel is possible, the team has said it does not see solar technology replacing conventional jet-powered planes any time soon. Instead, the project is designed to test and promote new energy-efficient technologies. Mr Piccard and Mr Borschberg hope to test the latest design of their aircraft with a flight from California to Virginia next year, before embarking on their epic round the world trip in 2015.","Solar Impulse team already hold record for longest solar-powered flight .

The lavatory at a rural museum has become a tourist attraction in its own right because of the way it leans at an extraordinary angle. Tourist have been flocking to the Museum of Steam Power and Land Drainage in Westonzoyland, Somerset, to take pictures of themselves using the listing loo. Dubbed the 'Leaning Tower Of Pee-sa', the small redbrick privy leans at an angle just like its Italian counterpart, and often attract queues as visitors take hilarious pictures of each other at the listed building. The station attendant's loo leans against the museum as demonstrated by museum helper Alan Davies, 58 . Talk about a listed building: Mr Davies demonstrates the angle of the wonky redbrick lavatory . Unlike the famed Italian tower, however, visitors are - in both senses - allowed to go inside. Giving . new meaning to the phrase 'listed building', the outdoor toilet at Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum was built . around 1940 for the use of the pumping station attendant. Due to soft ground and poor foundations, it began to . develop a lean soon after completion, and now reclines against the neighbouring museum building. The angular outhouse was spotted by keen-eyed Rod Morris, who said: 'It made me smile. 'The toilet block is leaning on the wall of a larger building - in much the same way a drunk would lean on a toilet wall.' Jason Keswick, membership secretary for the Westonzoyland Engine Trust, said: 'Nobody knows how long exactly it has been leaning for. Leaning Tower Of Pee-sa: The loo's foundations probably shifted soon after it was built in around 1920 . 'The toilet was built in the 1940s, before then there was just a wooden plank over the river. 'It was built on a level but over the years it has sunk on one side and leans against a building now so it can't move any more. 'The toilet is certainly a talking point for visitors, and it is very popular for people who take photos of it. 'It certainly brings a new meaning to . the term 'listed building' and it is still functional but we are . building a new block of toilets and it will just be an exhibit.' The museum, near Bridgwater, in . Somerset, is home to the county's oldest steam-powered pumping station, . which was once used to drain the Somerset Levels. The main attraction is the 1861 steam . engine and pump - the only one in the country still in its original . position and in working order.  The museum also has a number of steam . engines and pumps, as well as a short length of narrow-gauge railway. The mechanical pumping station was built in 1830 to drain the waterlogged 'Levels' around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy, and Othery. Its drainage system proved such a success that further pumping stations were built in the area to do the same job. A cottage was built next door to the . pumping station, to provide accommodation for the pumping attendant, and . later on the outdoor lavatory. The pump operated until 1951, by which time it had become redundant because of other, more modern, drainage methods. Now the pump house is Grade II-listed.","Loo at Westonzoyland Pumping Station in Somerset leans onto building .

The river valley crosses Titan's north . polar region and runs north into Ligeia Mare, one of the three great . seas in the moon's high northern latitudes.

Cassini is a Flagship-class robotic spacecraft sent to explore Saturn and its moons as part of a joint mission between Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. It launched in 1997 and finally arrived at the system in 2004 after an interplanetary voyage which included flybys of Earth, Venus, and Jupiter. It also included an atmospheric probe called Huygens which landed on Titan on 2005 to investigate its clouds, atmosphere and surface. It successfully returned data to Earth, using the orbiter as a relay, after what was was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System. On April 16, 2008, Nasa announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission, at which point it was renamed to the Cassini Equinox Mission. This was again extended in February 2010 with the Cassini Solstice Mission continuing until 2017. The current end of mission plan is a 2017 controlled fall into Saturn's atmosphere. 'Titan is the only place we've found . besides Earth that has a liquid in continuous movement on its surface,' said Steve Wall, the radar deputy team lead, based at NASA's Jet . Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. 'This picture gives us a snapshot of a . world in motion. Rain falls, and rivers move that rain to lakes and . seas, where evaporation starts the cycle all over again. 'On Earth, the liquid is water; on Titan, it's methane; but on both it affects most everything that happens.'

A southeast Iowa woman's decision to drive her minivan around a warning signal at a railroad crossing proved fatal after two of her three children were killed when a freight train struck them. A Dodge Caravan driven by 25-year-old Tara Lewman stopped at a train crossing Monday afternoon in the tiny city of Batavia, where she and her three children lived. Lewman saw a stopped train on the two sets of tracks in front of her and drove ahead and around the cross arms signalling motorists to stop, unable to see a second oncoming train, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright said. Horrific scene: Tara Lewman's Dodge Caravan minivan ended up in a ditch after being struck by a freight train at the Batavia rail crossing . Fatal mistake: Officials say Lewman went around the cross arms, not knowing that there was an oncoming train hiding from view behind another parked train . ‘She could not see because the train was blocking the view,’ Bright said. Witness Verdae Blom, who works just yards from the railroad corseting in Batavia, told The Des Moines Register that he heard a loud noise at around 4pm Monday and then saw a plume of dust rising from the tracks. He walked over to the railroad . crossing, only to discover that two children had been thrown out of a . crushed minivan which he said looked like a 'tangled mess' lying in a . ditch.

'She knew better,' Tara Lewman's uncle, Bert Lewman, told the Register. 'She shouldn't have ridden with the arm down, but it's just one of those things.' Bert Lewman described Tara's daughters, Kallie and Erika, as playful and happy, and said that his niece is a 'real good mom' who would do anything for her children. Kallie and Erika Lewman attended school at the Cardinal Community School District in Eldon, according to another parent Lacey Mills. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the . school district posted a message on Facebook that read: 'We are working . with staff and students to process this loss.' Mills said she told her 7-year-old son that his two schoolmates had died, 'he had tears in his eyes. 'He's like, ""Are they gonna come back?""'the mother said.

Sgt Bright said the incident is a reminder about train safety. ‘The best thing to do is to wait and not take for granted that the train is coming,’ he said. Since 1975, the Batavia crossing has been the scene of two other collisions involving vehicles being struck by trains, according to federal data. In 1991, a driver went around a crossing gate, and a passenger was killed by a train. Batavia, a city of about 500 people in Jefferson County, was also the site of a 1990 train derailment in which more than 85 people were injured, the Journal Express reported. The April 23, 1990, incident that involved a California Zephyr train also caused $1.8million worth of damage, or more than $3million in today’s money.","Tara Lewman, 25, went around the crossing gate in her Dodge Caravan minivan carrying three children .

"By . Tom Gardner . UPDATED: . 07:59 EST, 21 May 2012 . Nose hacked off, mutilated ears hidden by her dark hair, it was the magazine cover that horrified the world. But for Aesha Mohammadzai, the Afghan girl tortured by her husband for attempting to escape their abusive forced marriage, that extraordinary and harrowing Time magazine cover was just the start of the story. Four years on, she faces a new battle – a struggle to put the disturbing experiences behind her as she attempts to make a new life for herself in America. Resilient: Aesha Mohammadzai relaxes at her new home in America where she is building a new life . Aesha, won political asylum in 2011, having fled to the U.S. a year earlier, aged just 18, after being promised reconstructive surgery. She arrived without speaking a word of English and illiterate in her mother tongue of Pashto. Since then she has undergone pioneering reconstructive surgery to give her a prosthetic nose and been given the education denied women back in her homeland under the Taliban. However, it appears the psychological scars from her ordeal have proven harder to heal. Those who have become close to Aesha have spoken of her displaying volatile mood swings – oscillating between violent tantrums and displaying deep affection to people around her . Brave: Aisha, now 22, pictured wearing a type of prosthetic nose often used by film actors. Her nose and ears were hacked off by brutal in-laws after she was promised in marriage aged 12 . Her plastic surgery had to be delayed because it was thought she was still not yet emotionally stable to cope with the painful and lengthy surgery required. Psychologist Shiphra Bakhchi, 31, who has helped treat the 22-year-old for post-traumatic stress disorder believes the trauma of her disfigurement may have caused deeper mental scars than physical ones. ‘I really hope at some point she’ll be a functioning young lady that had a terrible trauma,’ the private practitioner told CNN. When Aesha was 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the stable with the animals. The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse. When she attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were hacked off by her husband as punishment. 'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose. 'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi. New beginning: Aisha has a prosthetic nose fitted using a special adhesive. She will eventually have reconstructive surgery . Left for dead in the mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks. They then transported Aesha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August 2010, she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a host family. She was taken in by a charity in New York called Women for Afghan Women who supported her and helped pay for her eduction. But Aesha soon became unhappy and her behaviour gave rise to concern. During one outburst during, she threw herself to the floor and slammed her head against the ground, grabbing at her hair and biting her fingers. Her primary guardian figure at the centre Esther Hyneman, who witnessed the tantrum said no one was able to prevent her from inflicting the injuries and they had to call 911 for help, Ms Hyneman  said during the CNN interview. Recovering: Aisha has received counselling following her traumatic experiences . Aesha was admitted to hospital for 10 days following that episode. Those who knew her said Aesha craved the close-knit family environment the centre was unable to provide. She left in December 2011, to live with with Mati Arsla and Jami Rasouli-Arsala, from Fredrick, Maryland - who are relatives of a Women for Afghan Women former board member - where she now appears to be adapting to home life. Ms Hyneman - who Aesha affectionately used to call 'grandma' - told CNN: ‘When she first came to us, she was an emotional wreck. ‘By the time she left, she was a different human being... So we’re all happy if she’s in the right place to further her development, but we miss her.’ Facing reality: Aisha's photo was on the front cover of Time Magazine in August 2010 . During the momentous few years since arriving in America, Aesha has had a prosthetic nose fitted at the non-profit humanitarian Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in California as part of her eight-month rehabilitation. Dr Peter H Grossman said they hoped to give Aesha a more 'permanent solution', which could mean reconstructing her nose and ears using bone, tissue and cartilage from other parts of her body. Dr Grossman's wife Rebecca, the chair of the Grossman Burn Foundation, said Aesha was just one of the thousands of women who are treated with appalling harshness. She said: 'Aesha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror. But there are still times she can laugh. And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice.'","Aesha Mohammadzai was horrifically disfigured and left for dead for trying to flee abusive forced marriage .

A jury acquitted an Alaska woman who shot her husband six times as he slept, killing him, after she said the man held her against her will and tortured her for three days. A Palmer jury on Tuesday found Lisa Donlon not guilty on all counts after several days of deliberations following a four-week trial, according to KTUU-TV. Donlon, a mother of three, was charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Acquitted: A jury has found Lisa Donlon not guilty on all charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after she fatally shot her husband while he was sleeping . She shot her husband, Jason Donlon, once in the head and five times in the back with a .45-caliber handgun while he slept on Oct. 7, 2010 before calling 911 to report the shooting. The defense argued Jason Donlon had been raping and torturing his wife for three days. They say he was keeping her against her will in a cabin or storage shed in Butte, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage. Prosecutors argued the killing was non-confrontational, and they said that while medical records showed evidence of scrapes and bruises there was nothing to indicate Lisa Donlon had been tortured. A grand jury initially declined to indict Donlon but reconsidered after prosecutors presented new evidence. Her lawyer argued that she was a victim of domestic violence and the shooting was justified. Role play: A prosecutor demonstrated in court how Donlon would have looked while standing over her sleeping husband and shooting him in the head once and then five times more in the back . ‘Anyone I think would have done what Lisa Donlon did to protect herself and to protect her children under those circumstances,’ said defense attorney Zachary Renfro according to KTUU during closing arguments. ‘Lisa Donlon was kept in a 12 by 20 cabin against her will, unable to leave by the threat of death to her, death to her children.’ The Donlons married in South Carolina in 1995, and court papers show trouble in their marriage when they were living in Eagle River in 2006. That year she obtained a restraining order against her husband and doctors documented her injuries. - Defense attorney Zachary Renfro . In a petition for the restraining order, she said he became enraged when she announced she wanted a divorce. 'He packed his things, told the kids . `bye,'' she wrote. 'Twenty minutes later he came back with his two . loaded guns. He was trying to force me to call the police because he . wanted to be shot by police officers so it wouldn't look like a . suicide.' She wrote that . her husband had pointed a gun to her chest before, had thrown her out . of the house with no clothes on -- an event she said was witnessed by . one of their sons. She also stated that her husband had choked her . unconscious. She said she didn't call police because she was scared. 'I have a feeling that he would use his guns easily, and I don't want to create any situation that would trigger that,' she wrote. Two days after she obtained the restraining order, Jason Donlon, who was a computer technician for the Alaska Army National Guard, filed for divorce, seeking custody of the children. The couple soon reconciled and were living in a small building behind the home of his mother and stepfather. Defense Attorney Zachary Renfro said that while Donlon was in jail she had weekly visits from her three sons. He said the next step is to work on a plan to reunite her with her children.","Lisa Donlon was found not guilty of second-degree murder, manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide on Tuesday .

I'm flattered, and I think it's great, but it's . also kind of crazy to me,' she said in an interview with USA Today. 'I guess it's kind of cool but it's still a bit surreal to me. Luxury: The couple will be moving out of their Fort Myers, Florida home, pictured, to take up the job . Stunning: He had tried to sell the home before his team's impressive run in the NCAA tournament . Moving up: But with his salary increasing by 10 times, he will have no problem finding something new . 'I just don't think I should be the . focus at all. The team is the biggest story. The best part is seeing . Andy and the players have their dreams actually come true. They are so . happy.' Instead she is happy staying a full-time mom to her three children: daughters Aila, 6, and Lily, 5, with son Marcum turning 2 next month. Basketball has had an integral role in the couple’s relationship, as they met at a regional tournament when her native Oklahoma State team was playing in New York and he was passing through town with a mutual friend on the way to a NCAA tournament.

A beloved sheriff known for cracking down on illegal drug trade in southern West Virginia's coalfields was fatally shot at point blank range where he's known to park his car for lunch, a state official said. Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum died from his injuries within a block of the county courthouse in Williamson on Wednesday afternoon with a suspect not long after taken into custody. Crum led a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge, said Delegate Harry Keith White, who . campaigned with Crum last year. Killed: Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum died of his wounds on Wednesday after being shot on the streets where he regularly parks his car for lunch . Tragedy: Crum died from his injuries at the scene after leading a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance as part of a campaign pledge . He said his friend was shot to death where he regularly parked his patrol vehicle to eat lunch, near the . site of a former pharmacy known for illegally distributing pills. 'I think anybody you ask would tell you he was a great guy, always with a positive attitude, always trying to help people,' White said. 'It's just a sad, sad day for Mingo County and the state of West Virginia.' The suspect, who was shot by a deputy, was taken to a hospital in Logan, said Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's chief of staff Rob Alsop said. The suspect wrecked his vehicle while attempting to flee the scene and was shot after he was seen raising his weapon, Capt Dave Nelson of the West Virginia State Patrol told CNN. The suspect has not yet been identified. The courthouse was immediately evacuated, streets into the city were blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene, Crum's body further shielded by two vehicles. Beloved: Friends say anyone who knew Crum would say he was a great guy who was always surrounded by family as a devote grandfather . Promises: Crum led a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge last year, he's seen while being sworn in . The shooting occurred within a block of the county courthouse, said Office of Emergency Services head dispatcher Willis Spence. Officials planned a news conference for 6 pm in the county in the southwest corner of West Virginia, on the border with Kentucky. Crum had resigned his post as a county magistrate before launching his sheriff's campaign as a signal of integrity, preferring to run as a civilian rather than an official, White said. He won the primarily handily and ran unopposed in the general election in the fall. Crum had been a magistrate for 12 years and had previously served as police chief in Delbarton. White said Crum was dedicated to improving the community and devoted to his grandchildren and adult children. 'He always had family around him,' he said. After dozens of indictments were issued earlier this year, Prosecutor Michael Sparks issued a press release declaring that Crum 'exceeded my highest expectations' and 'has provided a game changing boost to our drug enforcement program.' Crime scene: Law enforcement officers and emergency service personnel cover the vehicle at the scene of the shooting in downtown Williamson with one suspect in custody . Delegate Justin Marcum, D-Mingo and an assistant county prosecutor, called Crum 'a true friend to the county.' 'He'll be dearly missed,' he said. Williamson, a town of about 3,200, sits along the Tug Fork River in a part of the state long associated with violence. Mingo and neighboring McDowell County are home to the legendary blood feud between the Hatfield family of West Virginia and the McCoy family of Kentucky, a conflict dating to the Civil War. Crum's county was dubbed 'Bloody Mingo' during the early 20th century mine wars, when unionizing miners battled Baldwin-Felts security agents hired by the coal operators. In May 1920, after evicting striking miners in Red Jacket, some of the Baldwin-Felts men tried to board a train in nearby Matewan but were confronted by the mayor and the chief of police, Sid Hatfield, a former miner, who had family ties to the Hatfields in the feud. After a gun battle recreated in the 1987 John Sayles film 'Matewan,' the mayor, two miners, a bystander and three agents lay dead. Hatfield became a hero but was gunned down on the courthouse steps a year later in Matewan. Emergency response: The courthouse just one block away was evacuated, streets into the city were blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene . Though there is no indication of a direct connection, Crum's killing comes on the heels of a Texas district attorney and his wife being shot to death in their home over the weekend, and officials suspect a white supremacist prison gang. Those killings happened a couple of months after 1 of the county's assistant district attorneys was killed near his courthouse office. Colorado's corrections director, Tom Clements, was killed March 19 when he answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs. Two days later, Evan Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected of shooting Clements, died in a shootout about 100 miles from Kaufman. On Monday, judicial officials acknowledged Ebel was freed four years early because of a paperwork error. U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin called Crum's killing 'shocking' and said he's spoken to the State Police, which will lead the investigation. He pledged the assistance of his office and whatever other federal agencies are needed. Over the last century, 14 prosecutors have been killed, according to news reports and statistics kept by the National District Attorneys Association. At least 8 of them were targeted in the line of duty. The Officer Down Memorial Page says 197 police officers in West Virginia have died in the line of duty, 136 of them from deliberate gunfire.","Eugene Crum was shot at point blank range where he regularly parked his car for lunch .

The woman who married and had a child with a notorious Rockefeller imposter has described how she was charmed by the 'intelligent' and 'quirky' con man - and said they acted out characters from Cluedo. Sandy Boss, 45, who now works in London, gave evidence yesterday in the murder trial of Christian Gerhartsreiter, who told her he was 'Clark Rockefeller', a distant scion of the famous banking dynasty, when they met in New York in 1993. Ms Boss said of Gerhartsreiter, 52, who is charged with the 1985 murder of John Sohus in California: 'I didn't have reason to think he was not the person he said he was.' 'Quirky': Christian Gerhartsreiter, left, posed as 'Clark Rockefeller' to woo Sandra Boss, seen right in court yesterday, who told jurors she found him 'intelligent', 'funny' and 'quirky' 'Heir': Gerhartsreiter, seen in court yesterday, is on trial in California, U.S. for the 1985 murder of John Sohus, who disappeared from his home in San Marino with his wife, Linda . The couple married in 1995 and had a daughter, Reigh, who the defendant was later found guilty of kidnapping in 2009 after the then seven-year-old vanished during an access visit in Boston following the pair's split. Ms Boss first met the defendant when she was invited to a cocktail party at his New York apartment while she was studying for her MBA at Harvard, the court heard. The theme was the . game 'Clue', and guests came in costume. 'I was Miss Scarlett and he was Professor Plum,' said Ms Boss, who now lives in London with the couple's 12-year-old daughter. 'I liked him. I thought he was intelligent, very funny, quirky, flattering and complimentary. A good person to get to know.' They began dating and by 1994 she had graduated, secured a finance job in New York and moved in with him. He told her he was an heir to the Rockefeller fortune but was on the outs with the rest of his relatives and never saw them. He said his parents had been killed in a car crash in 1978. 'I assumed that what he was telling me was true,' she said. 'I didn't have reason to think he was not the person he said he was.' Kidnap: 'Rockefeller' was found guilty in 2009 of kidnapping the couple's daughter Reigh Boss, then seven, who disappeared from Boston during an access visit . Ms Boss described how the defendant's charming demeanor dissipated soon after they married in 1995, as he became insistent on secrecy in all of their affairs. He handled finances but she provided the funds and signed blank cheques for him to use. She said he put charges on her credit cards and had none in his own name. He installed multiple phone lines and had their mail delivered to post office boxes. They moved frequently. Divorce: The defendant is seen with his daughter, now 12, who lives in London with her mother . He also had an aversion to certain places. He refused to visit California which he said he hated and would never set foot in Connecticut. Unknown to her, he was under investigation in both places in connection with a missing persons case. Gerhartsreiter is charged with the 1985 murder of John Sohus, who disappeared from his San Marino, California, home with his wife, Linda. The man's bones were unearthed a decade later. Linda Sohus has never been found. Ms Boss had no idea her husband was a German immigrant named Christian Gerhartsreiter who had once lived in San Marino and was under investigation in the couple's disappearance. He told her he was doing Third World debt negotiations. Their daughter was born in 2001, she said. Ms Boss left her husband in 2007 after realising he was not who he claimed to be. 'I hired private investigators who told me they couldn't tell me who I was married to,"" she said. Ms Boss, 45, was composed on the witness stand but never mentioned her ex-husband's name, referring to him as 'the defendant'. She now lives in London with their 12-year-old daughter. Defense attorneys deferred cross-examination of Ms Boss until Wednesday. Earlier, a key witness linked the defendant to a truck bought by the man he is charged with killing in California more than a quarter-century ago. Christopher Bishop, who became an Episcopal priest, testified that in the 1980s he met a man who called himself Christopher Crowe. Mr Bishop was a film school student and was told by his father, a priest, that there was a new young man in their Greenwich, Connecticut, community who was a filmmaker. He introduced them and they became friends. Testimony: Christopher Bishop told jurors how he met Gerhartsreiter, who was then calling himself Christopher Crowe, in Connecticut in the 1980s . Mr Bishop said Crowe talked of producing films and one day he offered to give him a truck he said had been used on a production shoot. He suggested Bishop contact California to get license plates. But when he did, he said, he was told there was a lien on the vehicle for $6,000. 'I got a bright idea to buy a cheaper model of the same truck, take the plates off and register it. I was a poor film student then,' the witness said. He said he drove the truck around with fake plates and then abandoned it at a train station. He never saw it again, and it has never been found. Mr Bishop acknowledged lying about the saga when he was first questioned by police. 'I lied,' he said. 'I said I knew nothing about a truck. I was pretty panicked... This was a person I trusted.' He added: 'It was not my finest hour.' Ex-girlfriend: Mihoko Manabe, left, testified in the trial of Christian Gerhartsreiter, right, accused of murder in California in 1985, today. She told how her fiance acted strange when police called him over the deaths . Many identities: Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter listened as his ex-fiance told the court that she knew him as Clark Rockefeller when they met in 1987 . Mr Bishop said the . next time he talked to Crowe he told him a detective had been inquiring . about him, and angrily asked: 'Who the (expletive) are you?' 'He said ""I gotta go"", and that's the last I saw of Chris until this case,' the witness said. Other . witnesses have said victim John Sohus and his wife, Linda, bought the . truck just before they vanished in 1985. At the time they lived in a . suburban San Marino home owned by John Sohus' mother, and defendant . Gerhartsreiter - using the name Christopher Chichester - occupied a . guest cottage. Defense . attorneys claim that victim John Sohus was not killed by their client . but by his wife, who vanished at the same time he did. There has been no evidence of a motive for either Gerhartsreiter or Linda Sohus to kill John Sohus. Earlier in the . trial Gerhartsreiter's former lover Mihoko Manabe told jurors she never . knew his true identity until he was charged with murder. Manabe recalled meeting him in 1987 when they worked at a New York brokerage firm. Accused: Christian Gerhartsreiter is accused of the 1985 murder of John Sohus . Man of mystery: Manabe never knew he was Gerhartsreiter, a German immigrant charged with the murder of a California man who vanished in 1985 . Ms Manabe was working as a tranlator while the defendant was head of the bonds desk. She knew him as Christopher Crowe until he began using the Rockefeller pseudonym. She didn't know until recently that he was Gerhartsreiter, a German immigrant charged with the murder of a California man who vanished in 1985. 'He was an unusual person,' she said, but after police began calling to interview him, she said he became downright odd. 'After the call, he was markedly different,' she said. Connection: The bones believed to belong to Mr Sohus were found buried at a home Garhartsreiter was living at while going by the name Chichester . Violent death: The remains believed to be of John Sohus, seen with his then-wife Linda, who is also missing, were found to have died of multiple fractures of the skull inflicted by a blunt object, possibly a baseball bat . He became paranoid . and said they had to go into hiding. She described a cloak-and-dagger . existence in which he had her dye his hair blonde, grew a beard, . exchanged his glasses for contact lenses, and made plans to leave the . country. He proposed marriage and she accepted, she said, but they neither left the country nor got married. 'The plans all fell by the wayside,' she said. Her fiance quit . his job at another major brokerage house and never worked again. She . said she supported him while he stayed home and took care of bills and . household chores. She got him a credit card in the name Clark . Rockefeller. 'Why did you stick . around that long and go along with it?' asked Deputy District Attorney . Habib Balian. 'He had asked me to marry him and I was loyal,' she said. 'Did you love him?' asked Balian. 'Yes, I did,' said the witness as her former lover sat at a courtroom table taking notes and not looking at her. 'Did you believe he loved you?' asked the prosecutor. 'Yes,' she replied. Their relationship eventually deteriorated and in 1994 she left to marry another man. Manabe appeared nervous and said she would have preferred not to testify. 'It's not a part of my life I like to talk about or remember,' she said.","Sandy Boss told jurors she was charmed by 'bright, quirky' man .

A survivalist suspected of burglarizing Utah cabins and evading law enforcement for years had this to say to police finally caught up with him on Wednesday: 'Good job, you got me.' Troy James Knapp, 45, made the remarks Wednesday as he threw his rifle on the ground, ending a 50-man operation to capture him in the mountains outside of Ferron in central Utah, the Sanpete County Sheriff's Office said. Knapp was finally apprehended after allegedly firing shots at a police helicopter, pointing his gun at a sheriff, and leading authorities on a snowshoe chase, according to ABC News. Trapped: 'Mountain Man' Troy James Knapp is taken into custody by the Emery County Sheriff's Office on April 2 outside of Ferron in central Utah . Tracked down: The elusive survivalist was captured by police on Tuesday after spending five years allegedly robbing cabins in the wilderness and leaving taunts for officers . Knapp has long been suspected of hiding . out in the mountains of southern Utah, shooting up and robbing dozens . of cabins over the past six years. Police say he's been living off the . comfort of cabins in winter and retreating to makeshift summer camps . deep in the forest with stolen guns and supplies. The operation to apprehend him was launched after two hunters ran into him on a trail last Friday. 'He was asking how much snow was up the trail further,' Sevier County Sheriff Nathan Curtis told ABCNews.com.  'Their dog was acting nervous and growling, and he said, ""Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you guys.""' Knapp didn't identify himself, but called himself a 'mountain man.' After the encounter, the hunters alerted authorities. Finally caught: Troy James Knapp was arrested today, left, after evading cops for years. He was last arrested in 2001, right . Prior to last Friday, the last known . time Knapp was spotted was on October 1 last year by a surveillance . camera in Sanpete County. He had a gun slung over his shoulder and was using binoculars to scope . for an alarm system at a cabin near Gooseberry Reservoir before breaking in. Iron, Kane and Garfield counties have all issued arrest warrants for Knapp on burglary and weapons charges. While there have been no violent confrontations with Knapp, authorities had feared he was a ticking time bomb. In custody: Snow-mobilers pass the sheriff's truck carrying the 45-year-old suspect . In 5th District Court in Iron County, . Knapp is facing four counts of burglary, a second-degree felony; theft, . a second-degree felony; and three counts of theft, a class B . misdemeanor - all charges for incidents spanning June 2009 through . September of 2011. He is suspected of leaving some . cabins riddled with bullet holes, defacing religious icons and writing . taunting notes for cabin owners and authorities. 'Hey Sheriff...Gonna put you in the ground!' one note said, according to court records. Records . indicate Knapp fell off the radar in 2002 when he apparently left . California in violation of his parole for a burglary conviction. He was charged with theft in 2000 in California, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison, according to records. Mountain mystery: A man believed to be serial burglar and expert survivalist Troy James Knapp was caught on CCTV last year in Sanpete County, Utah . Roaming: The 'mountain man' was spotted on CCTV in Sanpete County, Utah last week but once again police have failed to track down the expert survivalist . As . a teenager, Knapp was convicted in Michigan of breaking and entering, . passing bad checks and unlawful flight from authorities, according to . court records in Kalamazoo County. His . most serious arrest for felony assault in Michigan was reduced in 1994 . to a charge of malicious destruction of property after he agreed to . plead guilty. He has been compared to Davy . Crockett, the 19th century Tennessean known as 'King of . the Wild Frontier', and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of . wilderness. Knapp has family members in Moscow, Idaho, but they have not commented. One hunter, who is believed to have bumped into Knapp in June, asked him his name and was simply told: 'The Mountain'. Long search: Troy James Knapp, 44, pictured in December 2011. It is believed that he is responsible for a series of burglaries at holiday homes in the Utah wilderness . Mysterious: Investigators have found abandoned camps in the Utah wilderness, like the one pictured, dozens of guns, high-end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor . ‘This guy is probably about as true a . survivalist as Davy Crockett,’ U.S. Marshal Michael Wingert said at the time. Comparison: Authorities say Knapp is like Davy Crockett, a 19th century survival expert portrayed by Fess Parker in the 1955 Disney film given his name . Anyone with information has been asked to contact authorities. In December 2011, photos were taken of a sandy-haired man in camouflage on snowshoes, a rifle slung over his shoulder, believed to be Knapp. It is thought that the expert woodsman has spent around seven years breaking into cabins in winter, living off hot food, . alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies. In . February, it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin . after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight. It . turned out they were solar-powered lights on the porch, and the cabin . was empty - another dead-end. But their break came in January 2012 with the . fingerprint match. Early on, investigators thought his . unattended camps they came across during their search were left . behind by ‘doomsday’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse. This . was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns, . radios, batteries, dehydrated food and camping gear. They now have a . name, but the man remains in the mist.

A California woman convicted of killing her ex-husband by dousing him with a pot of boiling water faces 16 years to life in prison. Jesusa Ursonal Tatad, 41, pleaded no contest to second-degree murder on Wednesday in a horrific attack that ended in the death of 36-year-old Ronnie Tatad of Daily City. Prosecutors say that on the morning of November 26 of 2011, Jesusa Tatad pulled back the blankets on her ex-husband sleeping in their shared apartment before throwing a pot of boiling water on him. She then proceeded to hit him over the head with a baseball bat, according to authorities. The San Mateo County Times reports that Ronnie Tatad died about two weeks later of a blood infection connected to his burns. Tatad . had accused him of seeing another woman two weeks before the attack . after allegedly walking in on him with another woman in their apartment. Even . though the couple divorced in 2007 Ronnie Tatad had promised to . re-marry her and bring their two daughters, aged 9 and 14, back from the . Philippines to live with them, his ex-wife said. Killed: Ronnie Tatad, 36, died from his injuries two weeks after he was attacked for allegedly having an affair with another woman despite promising to remarry his ex-wife . When he arrived home late the night before, Tatad went into a fit of jealousy, boiled the water and flung it on him, burning 55 percent of his body according to prosecutors. 'He came home later than he was supposed to,' defense attorney John May said. 'That's all I can say.' He added: 'This is an acknowledgement by her that she caused the death of the only man she ever loved ... She wished she could change the past but she can't.' Moments after fleeing his apartment Ronnie Tatad was found by an apartment maintenance man who called 911 after seeing the man half naked and hysterically hiding behind a car. Police say the man grew even more hysterical once seeing his ex-wife follow him outside their apartment. As part of a plea deal additional charges of torture and mayhem were dropped. Tatad is being held without bail at the San Mateo County Jail. She is scheduled to be sentenced on May 17.","Jesusa Ursonal Tatad, 41, is convicted in the death of Ronnie Tatad, 36, in 2011 .

The chubby Warwick University student president, who is standing for re-election this week, then cheers as the shocked girl desperately tries to cover herself up . Swain lunged at the student during the filming of a promotional video for the university's skiing and snowboarding society in December 2011. He and friends had gone abroad for the ski trip, believed to be in Austria, where they shot the footage. But a disgusted student uploaded the clip to YouTube this week - which has been viewed 5,000 times - branding him 'vile' and demanding an apology. The 90-second clip also shows half-naked students pulling their trousers down, appearing to wear Hitler moustaches while shouting 'get your t*ts out'. The video opens with a shot of Swain - . studying for an MA in Creative and Media Enterprises at the Coventry seat of learning - sitting at a . table laden with empty bottles. The camera then pans around the room showing male students downing drinks before Swain is seen creeping up behind a group of girls who are wearing just their underwear. A friend of the victim tries to stop him but he forces her away before carefully unhooking the bra. He then triumphantly turns around to face the camera holding his fist in the air. The video repeats the motion several times before a sign appears on screen stating: 'Warwick SU (Students' Union). We demand an apology from Nick Swain for his foul, sexist behaviour.

A great British cheese is under threat – because young people are afraid to eat the mould, researchers have warned. Sales of Blue Stilton are collapsing among under-25s and it is mainly bought by those nearing middle age, a study for the Co-operative has revealed . Industry experts say the number of people under 45 buying the cheese has dropped by 18 per cent in the last two years alone. Mould for the old: The number of people under 45 buying Blue Stilton has dropped by 18 per cent since 2011 . Consumption by those under 30 has slumped by 23 per cent and few people under 25 would ever consider buying it regularly. ‘This cheese is part of Britain’s heritage’, said Co-op cheese buyer Mark Cloudy. ‘We can’t stand by and let it fade away, yet the people who like it are getting old. ’Millions of young people have been taught not to eat food with mould on it, and that view is having a catastrophic effect upon Blue Stilton. They take one look at the blue veins running through the cheese and then turn away. ‘We want to tell everyone just how good Blue Stilton is. It is one of the best cheeses in the world, and it’s produced here in Britain - but yet few people realise what a gem they have on their own doorstep.' Ironically, while Blue Stilton is declining in popularity in Britain, overseas buyers can’t get enough of it. The cheese is regarded as a supreme delicacy in Europe and across America, with buyers prepared to pay up to £30 a kilo - over three times the UK price. Big in America: While sales decline in in Britain, Blue Stilton is going for over three times the UK price in America and the rest of Europe . Some experts even prefer it to the world renowned Roquefort blue cheese from France, because it has less salt and a much smoother, balanced taste. Now the Co-operative, which actively supports British producers, is calling upon leading TV chefs to join their campaign to save the traditional cheese, . As well as producing new customer recipes which using Stilton, it believes that the likes of Jamie Oliver, Heston Blumenthal and Nigel Slater have can play a vital role in making Stilton great again. Said Mr Cloudy: ‘ Cookery programmes are watched by millions of people every week. Seeing British chefs using Blue Stilton would help a new generation of consumers to discover what a wonderful ingredient Blue Stilton is. ‘ We also want to make the cheese popular again to help British cheese producers. Local companies employing local people depend upon Stilton sales to make a living. ‘We hope that our campaign will help Blue Stilton cheese makers of all sizes continue to thrive for decades to come’ Industry expert say that the number of people under the age of 45 buying Blue Stilton has dropped by 18 per cent in the last two years alone. Consumption by those under 30 years of age has dropped by 23 per cent. And few people under the age of 25 would consider buying it regularly. Blue Stilton was first produced in Britain in 1730 and is named after the village of Stilton where the cheese was first made. Blue mould is encouraged to grow on the cheese deliberately to create a distinctive acidic tang which blends perfectly with the cheese’s rich, creamy texture - and it is perfectly safe to eat. So highly regarded is the cheese that it is the only British variety to have been granted protected trademark status. Only Stilton made from pasteurized cows milk in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire can legally use the name. Just five dairies currently make the cheese. Traditionally Blue Stilton is eaten with port at Christmas, but is often used in classic recipes such as Stilton and Pear salad, and cream of celery or broccoli soup. To enjoy the full flavours of Blue Stilton, it should be removed from the refrigerator approximately one hour before serving, to let the cheese reach room temperature.","Sales of Blue Stilton are dropping among under-25s, study reveals .

The victims, two men aged 87 and 27, became sick in Shanghai, one of the country's largest cities, in late February and died earlier this month. Another woman in nearby Anhui province also contracted the virus in March and is in a critical condition. Deadly: A new strain of avian flu has killed two people in China. The disease spreads easily among birds and is prevalent in south east Asia but Britain was hit by an outbreak in 2007 . Worry: The two victims were infected in the city of Shanghai, one of the biggest in China . The strain of the bird flu virus found in all three people was identified as H7N9, which had not been transmitted to humans before, according the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission. The first birds were infected in 1996, while the disease spread to a humans for the first time in Hong Kong a year later. It began to move throughout Asia before cases were later found in Europe . Experts . have warned the high contagious disease is the world's biggest pandemic . threat and could kill between 5 million and 150 million people. The . disease is expected to continue mutating within birds but has largely . been brought under control in Asia due to vaccination programmes. Seventeen governments around the world are preparing vaccines to combat a pandemic. The victims showed symptoms of fever and coughs that later developed into pneumonia. It is still unclear they . were infected. The World Health Organization says it is 'closely monitoring the situation' in China, regional agency spokesman Timothy O'Leary said in Manila, Philippines, and said the latest strain was not contagious. 'There is apparently no evidence of human-to-human transmission, and transmission of the virus appears to be inefficient, therefore the risk to public health would appear to be low,"" O'Leary said. While WHO is confident the latest . strain will not easily spread -  no symptoms have been reported in any . people who had been in contact with the victims -  the deaths will reignite . fears over the disease. The . most common strain of bird flu, H5N1, found mainly in south east Asia, . is highly contagious among birds and can spread to humans. Tens . of millions of birds have been culled to stop the spread, which has . been brought under control by animal vaccination programmes.

Let down: John Morgan, 71, believes if he had been diagnosed sooner he may not have lost sight in his right eye . A grandfather has been left blind in one eye after medics missed four opportunities to diagnose a treatable disease. John Morgan, 71, from Ormskirk, visited an optician, a GP and four separate hospitals before he was finally treated for wet Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The condition is the most common cause of blindness in the UK affecting around 500,00 people. But by then he was told the disease was so far advanced nothing could be done and he has permanently lost vision in his right eye. The ordeal began when Mr Morgan, a retired HGV driver, started experiencing eyesight problems two years ago and booked an appointment at a Boots opticians. He was told he probably had 'astigmatism' a common eye defect. But months later he felt the situation had got worse and went to see his GP. He was referred to Ormskirk Hospital but had to wait around three weeks for an appointment. 'Coloured objects in my right eye seemed . faded and there was a slight tinge to straight lines. The GP sent me to . Ormskirk Hospital and I had drops put in my eye and dye in the vein and . it was then that I heard him say it could be something to do with the . macular,' said Mr Morgan. The father-of-three was given a 'vague' diagnosis of AMD but was not given any treatment. Instead he was sent to Southport Hospital because 'they had better equipment'. But again this took several weeks and the same tests were repeated. 'When I finally had the appointment . the nurse seemed quite shocked and taken a back by how much the sight in . my right eye had deteriorated between coming to them and being . initially seen at Ormskirk,' said Mr Morgan. He was then transferred to a third hospital -  Fazakerley Hospital in Liverpool. 'There . was no fast tracking me to get an appointment there either and when I . did finally see someone they looked at my right eye and told me there . was nothing they could do for me and I was basically told to go away,' he added. Scroll down for video . Mr Morgan had to wait at least three weeks for an appointment at Ormskirk Hospital after being referred by his GP . Mr Morgan was still unable to get a proper diagnosis for his eye condition after visiting Fazakerley Hospital (Aintree University Hospital) Determined to get a proper diagnosis, Mr Morgan went to a fourth hospital where he was finally told he was suffering from wet AMD. But by this point there was nothing that could be done as his macular had deteriorated so badly. 'They said ""sorry, you're too late, we can't do anything for you. The damage is done."" I feel strongly that I should have been fast tracked and that I should have been sent to the right hospital straight away,' he said. 'I feel like I've been really let down by the system. There was no sense of urgency in any of this. I just got pushed from hospital to hospital and because of the delays I've now lost the central vision in my right eye for good. 'I should have been treated better than this. They knew how rapidly I could lose my sight by there was delay after delay,' he added. Mr Morgan now has to rely heavily on his left eye and fears that his partial blindness will stop him enjoying his hobby of riding vintage motorbikes. 'If I'd known back then what I know now, I would have been shouting from the roof tops demanding treatment right from the start. This can't continue to happen to other people,' he said. Ormskirk and Southport NHS Hospital Trust said it was unable to comment on an individual case. A spokesman for Aintree University Hospitals Trust said: 'If Mr Morgan needs to raise any issues about the care he received, he should contact our customer care team and we would be happy to discuss this further with him.'

This dazed-looking fox has a huge fan base in Russia, where the badly-stuffed creature became a surprise internet smash after he was spotted for sale on eBay. The animal - dubbed Stoned Fox thanks to his bemused expression - proved such a hit his British creator has taken him all the way to St Petersburg for locals to get a closer look. But it seems Russians are not universally fond of Stoned Fox, after local politicians in the city labelled the comical creature 'vile' and 'Russophobic'. A statement from the local branch of the Communist Party described Stoned Fox's British creator, Adele Morse, as an 'unfriendly emissary from England' and demanded that her exhibition be shut down, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph. Their suggestion that the artist 'had allowed herself to mock a great people and its history' comes after she was quoted as saying fans had told her they liked Stoned Fox because he 'looks a bit sad and drunk and that's how Russians feel'. Ms Morse, who is based in Dalston, East London, has said she was misquoted. The Welsh artist is in Russia to give a series of seminars on Stoned Fox and the thousands of internet memes he inspired. Ms Morse was inundated with pictures showing the creature pasted into a host of unlikely scenarios; from inside the Oval Office with Barack Obama, to lounging on a park bench with Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves. Ms Morse had experimented with stuffing the fox, which died of natural causes, and put the finished item on eBay. Scroll down for video .

Internet users even created Stoned Fox's tail's own Seven Year Itch moment with Marilyn Monroe thanks to Photoshop . Ms Morse is also due to meet journalists and fans to tell them about how Stoned Fox came to exist. The eBay auction which sparked the craze started bidding at £12. Ms Morse described the item as: 'a young Red Fox made to look as though it is a human. 'I usually practice traditional taxidermy but I decided to try something a little different.

He was released on a $3 million bail. SAC Capital suspended Steinberg from his . post in October 2012, and he has been moving among several hotels in .

Steinberg's lawyer Barry Berke said in a statement to Reuters that his client had done 'absolutely nothing wrong.' 'At all times, his trading decisions were based on detailed analysis as well as information that he understood had been properly obtained through the types of channels that institutional investors rely upon on a daily basis,' Berke said. Meanwhile: Steven A. Cohen this week bought Picasso's Le Rêve for $155million as well as a Hamptons home for $60million . FBI Assistant Director George . Venizelos characterized the research used by Steinberg as 'nothing more . than well-timed tips from an extensive network of well-sourced . analysts.' 'Mr. Steinberg was at the center of an elite criminal club, where cheating and corruption were rewarded,' Venizelos said. Steinberg, 40, is the most senior SAC Capital Advisors employee to be charged in the U.S. government's probe into how hedge funds may use illegally obtained information to trade. Including Steinberg, nine people have been either charged or implicated with wrongful trading while they were employed at the Stamford, Connecticut-headquartered SAC. An SAC Capital spokesman had no immediate comment on the arrest. Steinberg's arrest had been widely expected after Jon Horvath, a former SAC analyst who worked closely with him, pleaded guilty last year to using illegally obtained information to trade in Dell and Nvidia Corp. Horvath has been cooperating with the government and had implicated Steinberg. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara issued a statement saying that Steinberg 'cultivated' insider information from other sources. 'As alleged, Michael Steinberg was another Wall Street insider who fed off a corrupt grapevine of proprietary and confidential information cultivated by other professionals who made their own rules to make money,' the statement said. 'With lightning speed in at least one case, Mr. Steinberg seized on the opportunity to cash in and tried to keep his crime quiet, as charged in the Indictment.'

A teenager accused of raping a girl at a sleepover claims he was sleepwalking during the alleged attack. The defendant, who can't be named for legal reasons, denies the offence, claiming he was suffering from a condition which has been termed 'sexsomnia'. A court heard that before the alleged rape the teenagers had been watching the 2008 film Taken. The 16-year-old girl alleges she woke up on a friend's sofa to find the 18-year-old on top of her. The defendant denies raping the 16-year-old girl, claiming he was suffering from 'sexsomnia', Leicester Crown Court (pictured) has heard . In a filmed police statement, played at Leicester Crown Court yesterday, she said: 'I remember just waking up and realising what he was doing. He was raping me. 'It was without my consent or knowledge beforehand because I was asleep and he woke me up. It was the middle of the night. 'I pushed his shoulders and chest. I was confused and afraid and managed to scramble away from him. 'I fell off the end of the sofa. He moved away and said, ""I haven't done anything"". 'He kept trying to grab me, saying I'd imagined it.' The alleged victim said she had slept fully dressed on the sofa of the house in Loughborough, while the teenager had slept on the floor. The court heard that before the alleged rape the teenagers had been watching the 2008 film Taken . She claimed the defendant later told a friend sleeping upstairs he had not done anything and suggested swapping rooms - and that if he left the room she would later wake up and think it was 'all a dream'. She claimed the defendant, also from Loughborough, had undone her belt buckle and pulled down her briefs, leggings and shorts to carry out the alleged attack while she slept on April 26, 2011. The girl claimed the accused was earlier 'staring' at her, making her feel uncomfortable, as she and others watched the film. She said she had been reluctant to share the lounge with the defendant overnight, but did not make 'a big deal' of it. 'I didn't think he'd do something like this,' she said. The girl claimed she fell asleep while watching television, after others had gone to bed. She said she last remembers the defendant, also a house guest, arranging his sleeping bag on the floor. Felicity Gerry, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant denies rape on the basis he was asleep and doesn't accept he penetrated her. 'The Crown says you can be sure he was not asleep, but she was. He raped her and got caught. He claims he was sleepwalking.' She said it was linked to a recognised condition known as 'sexsomnia.' Miss Gerry said: 'It wasn't a particularly rowdy evening, although there was some evidence cannabis had been smoked.' The trial continues.

India has seen a sharp fall in the numbers of foreign tourists, especially women, since the high-profile rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi, a study has found. In the three months since that attack, the number of foreigners travelling to India has dropped by 25 per cent, according to the the New Delhi-based Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The number of women tourists has dropped by 35 per cent, the study released last night said. Drop in tourists: Three camel riders reflected in the River Yamuna with the Taj Mahal beyond, Agra, Uttar Pradesh . The gang rape of the 23-year-old university student on a bus in the heart of the Indian capital shocked a country often inured to such sexual violence. It brought hundreds of thousands of angry citizens out in the streets to demand more safety for women and harsher laws to deter the perpetrators of such acts. The study surveyed 1,200 tour operators from across the country who said that 'concerns about the safety of female travelers' had impacted how foreign travelers viewed India. Since the December gang rape there have been two widely publicised incidents where foreign female travellers have been attacked. Last month a Swiss woman was gang raped in central India as she and her husband camped in a remote forest. However, it emerged today that she has asked judges trying her six attackers not to impose the death penalty. Women's rights: The new law has been passed following nationwide protests sparked by the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi . Outrage: The brutal attack at the end of last year sent shock waves across India . Jump: The British woman leapt from a second floor balcony (circled) of the Hotel Agra Mahal at the centre of Agra, she said to avoid being attacked . Sachin Chauhan, manager of the Hotel Agra Mahal, escorted by police to a court in Agra. He appeared in court alongside one other man accused of harassing a British tourist who jumped off her hotel balcony fearing a sex attack . Judges in Daita, central India, . opened the case on Saturday with four of the six charged with rape and . the other two facing assault and robbery charges. The court heard that the 39-year-old . victim and her husband had been on a cycling holiday in Madhya Pradesh . state when their camp was attacked by the gang. After beating and tying up her 30-year-old husband, the gang pinned down and raped his terrified wife, said prosecutors. The Swiss couple were not in court but are expected to give evidence in person during the two week trial. Judges adjourned the case until later this month. In the second incident a young . British woman says she was forced to jump out of the window of her hotel . room to avoid a sexual attack in Agra, the city that is home to the Taj . Mahal. According to the study, the three incidents have hurt tourism and nearly 72 percent of the tour operators said cancellations of holiday bookings came mostly from women tourists, most of them from Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia. The study said that travelers planning trips to India had instead opted for other Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. The winter months from November to March mark the peak tourist season in India. According to India's Tourism Ministry, 6.6 million foreign tourists visited India in 2012, earning the country $17.74billion in foreign exchange.","Decline follows high-profile rape and murder of young woman in Delhi .

The extraordinary impact of the Daily Mail’s marathon Stephen Lawrence campaign has been acknowledged in an independent poll marking the 20th anniversary of his murder. Two thirds of those questioned about the teenager’s racist killing said the media had played a key role in keeping the case in the spotlight. They added this showed campaigning journalism can act as a force for good in Britain. Details of the poll, commissioned by the think-tank British Future, emerged only a few weeks after one of Stephen’s killers finally admitted defeat in his battle to clear his name. Gary Dobson, 37, one of two men jailed for life last year over Stephen’s racist killing, dropped his appeal against conviction. His decision was welcomed by Stephen’s mother Doreen Lawrence, who urged the other man jailed for her son’s murder, David Norris, 36, to follow Dobson’s  example and drop his appeal. Dobson’s decision to throw in the towel was a victory for the Daily Mail, which for 16 years has campaigned for justice for Stephen. In February 1997, we famously published pictures of the five prime suspects – Dobson, Norris, Neil Acourt, Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight – under the headline ‘Murderers’ and challenged them to sue us if we were wrong. No legal action was ever taken. We repeated the front page in July 2006, and again none of the race-hate yobs issued legal proceedings. Our acclaimed campaign exposed police failings and led to the setting up of a public inquiry which branded the Met ‘institutionally racist’, and changes in the justice system which allowed Dobson, previously acquitted of Stephen’s murder, to stand trial again. After the two men were found guilty of Stephen’s murder in January last year, Dobson was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years and two months, while Norris was given a minimum of 14 years and three months. The iconic Mail front page from 1997 . Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence's tribute from 2012 . As Stephen’s family prepares for what is likely to be a hugely poignant memorial service on April 22, marking exactly two decades since his murder, British Future released the findings of a poll it commissioned about the case. It surveyed a representative sample of 2,000 adults across Britain. Sixty-seven per cent of those questioned agreed that the ‘role of the media in keeping the Stephen Lawrence case in the spotlight showed that campaigning journalism can be a force for good’. Only 6 per cent of people disagreed, while the rest were undecided. Most people questioned in the survey believe that racism in Britain has fallen since Stephen’s murder but they recognise significant levels of prejudice remain. The public also saluted the determination of the Lawrence family. An extraordinary 74 per cent believe their campaign for justice shows that ‘ordinary people who are determined can achieve real change and win justice’, with just  4 per cent disagreeing. Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said: ‘This poll shows that the public do believe that the campaign for justice made an important difference. ‘Hate crimes still happen, but the best way to honour this anniversary is to redouble our efforts to stamp out the prejudices that feed them.’ Labour MP David Lammy said: ‘It’s important to remember that those who killed Stephen didn’t represent Britain then, and racists in 2013 don’t represent Britain now. The country is a better place, but we shouldn’t pretend that the issue has gone away.’","Two thirds said media helped keep racist killing in the spotlight .

A mother switched on her new DVD player for her children to watch a Disney film - only for hardcore pornography to flash up on the screen. Mother-of-three Samantha John, 25, had bought the DVD player from an Argos store as an Easter present for her children aged six, four and one. She wired it to the family's widescreen TV - but before she could insert a Disney film into the machine a 'disgusting' image flashed up on screen in front of her family. Samantha John, with her three children Kady, Natalya (striped top) and Kayla, was shocked when the graphic images flashed up onscreen . It was offering three different pornographic movies and showed an explicit picture from each of the films. Stunned Samantha said: 'I panicked - I could not believe my eyes. 'It was not something you would want your children to see - it was disgusting. 'I was desperately looking for the off button on the DVD player but because it was new I couldn't find it. 'My eldest was saying: ""What's that mummy?"" I didn't know what to say. 'I just lunged forward at the TV and switched it off at the mains. 'I feel as if my children's innocence has been taken away from them.' The mother discover that her children's Easter present contained a DVD marked 'xxx' containing hardcore pornorgraphy . Ms John, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, paid £19.99 for the Argos Value DVD player after her old one broke. But she noticed there was no remote control in the box - or any instruction leaflet. Samantha bought the DVD last Thursday and gave it to her children on Easter Sunday. She said: 'It was packed in the normal way, wedged between two pieces of white polystyrene. 'It looked new but obviously someone had been using it to watch an explicit adult movie. 'And from what I saw on the screen it was very explicit.' Samantha ejected the DVD to find a white disk with the letters 'XXX' on it. Definitely not Disney: Argos says it has launched an investigation after the mother complained to them about the DVD . She is now worried her little girls Kady, six, Natalya, four and Kyla, one, will be left damaged by the images. She said: 'They have hundreds of DVDs but I had bought them The Tooth Fairy and Marmaduke to go with the DVD. 'I am shocked and upset that they could have ended up watching something else altogether. 'What if I hadn't been in the room?' Samantha's father-in-law Christopher Ryan, 45, complained to Argos but claims he was told it was 'no big deal' because the girls were too young to realise what was on the screen. He said: 'I was speechless. It is bad enough someone left pornography in the DVD player but to dismiss it like it was nothing is extraordinary.' A spokesman for Argos said: 'Argos is a family retailer and we were extremely concerned to learn of this incident. 'We have asked the customer to return the player to our store so we can carry out an urgent investigation.'","Samantha John purchased the DVD player as an Easter gift for her children .

If you know someone who’s recently undergone a transformation – lost weight, toned up, suddenly seem incredibly smiley all the time – perhaps they’ve become a client of Bodyism. It has become such a phenomenon that Londoners in-the-know refer to that 'Bodyism glow'. For Bodyism has become the gym in London. Founded by James Duigan seven years ago, it recently moved to new premises at the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, and is patronised by the likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Hugh Grant and countless other supermodels and Hollywood A-listers. The rumour mill is abuzz that an LA outpost will open later in 2013. Duigan’s accompanying Clean and Lean diet and exercise books (Clean & Lean, Flat Tummy Fast, Clean & Lean Cookbook and Warrior) have become bestsellers, and the gym’s Body Brilliance shakes - which stars like Rosie regularly tweet about - went global in January. Fitness guru: James Duigan set up Bodyism seven years ago and has fast become the go-to guy in the capital thanks to his innovative approach . Bodyism is far more than just a place to come to work out and tone up; it’s a mecca for anyone with body issue demons to exorcise. The level of post-session support is such that, if you’re having trouble making the right food choices, you can even text Bodyism staff for guidance. The positive attitude is infectious and the overall effect is cathartic, as any devotee will tell you. 'It's not like you come in to do a healing session, but it is just a very healing place,' says James Duigan. 'It’s not so much what we do, it’s why we do it – and the reason we do it is to change people’s lives.' A-list fans: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, left, and Elle Macpherson have worked out at the Knightsbridge gym . Bestseller: James also imparts health and fitness advice in his book 'Clean and Lean Diet' At Bodyism, the crack team of trainers . rotates, so that your sessions are always interesting and challenging, . you reap the benefit of different experts’ specialities, and you won’t . be knocked off your fitness course if one of them is away. Your attitude to your own health and fitness is key to your level of success, says Duigan. 'It's not about 'What's more important, food or exercise?' It's the attitude. You can't really have one without the other,' he explains. In short: it's a holistic approach. 'I want to change your mind-set as well as your shape,' continues Duigan. 'I believe that if we start changing the conversations people have with themselves, then we can really take the shame and guilt away from people’s relationship with food.' So your trainer might talk to you about your emotional food triggers, for example. 'But it’s not like in the middle of a session we say ‘Ok, we’re going to talk about the mentality now. That’s part and parcel of the session.' If you feel like some super intensive treatment, you could always move in to the hotel, have your daily training session in the gym and the indoor pool, and eat only the Duigan Clean and Lean menu – even couples are doing it together. Get that Bodyism glow: The gym is based at the Bulgari Hotel in London's Knightsbridge . 'I truly believe that Bodyism was born when we moved to the Bulgari,' says Duigan. 'Because it gave us the facilities we need, this amazing, beautiful space and infrastructure to take us to the next level.' And how Duigan feels about the Bulgari is pretty much how clients feel about Bodyism. A next level never seemed so easy – and pleasurable – to achieve.

Cranes have nested in southern England for the first time in 400 years – after a group of conservationists  dressed as giant birds to show them how to do it. The common crane, as its name suggests, was once widespread in Britain, but came close to extinction around 1600 from overhunting and their wetlands habitat being drained. But now, after being raised from eggs at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust base in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, four birds have built their own nest on the Severn estuary.

Nature, however, needed a bit of a helping hand, as the birds had none of their own species around to teach them the necessary skills to survive in the wild. So staff at the WWT disguised themselves in custom-made crane suits and spent almost every day for 12 weeks with the birds. The young cranes were taught how to forage for food and avoid predators. Human interaction without the crane suits was limited to ensure the birds did not lose their innate fear of people, as this could make them vulnerable in the wild.

'It’s even more exciting knowing these are some of the birds we taught by hand to survive by themselves. I feel like a very proud parent.’ A small group of cranes has been established on a reserve in East Anglia since 1979, but it is hoped this latest milestone will enable the birds to flourish on their own and eventually become a common sight in Britain’s wetland areas once again.","Cranes came close to extinction as wetlands drained and due to overhunting .

Some drivers have been charged £2 a tank more for petrol than motorists in neighbouring towns over Easter due to some retailers failing to pass on a dip in wholesale petrol costs . Millions of motorists are paying up to £2 more a time to fill up than drivers in neighbouring towns in a petrol pricing lottery, the AA warned yesterday. Drivers have been left ‘high and dry’ by the widespread differences in fuel costs prompted by a refusal by some forecourts to pass on a recent drop in wholesale petrol prices. And the motoring group warned that prices across the country are expected to jump again in the next few weeks, bringing misery  to small businesses and families who rely on their cars. Average prices hit a year high of 140p a litre at the start of last month, but have since fallen back to a current average of 137.8p. But across the country there remain large discrepancies in what forecourts are charging, even in towns a few miles apart. In Canterbury, the cheapest petrol available on Tuesday was 134.7p for a litre of unleaded. But in nearby Dover, the best price was 138.9p – about £2 extra to fill up a tank. The best deal in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was 137.9p a litre, over three pence more than the 134.7p charged just 20 miles away in Milton Keynes. And in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the cheapest petrol was 134.7p per litre compared with 138.9p, 11 miles down the road in New Ollerton. The AA said most towns enjoying cheaper prices have a Sainsbury’s which sells petrol. The supermarket giant recently dropped prices by 4p a litre to reflect the reduction in wholesale costs, prompting forecourts in surrounding areas to do the same in order to remain competitive. Wholesale petrol costs started to rise again last week as the market anticipated greater demand with the start of the United States' motoring season . Luke Bosdet, spokesman for the AA, . said: ‘In towns where there isn’t a Sainsbury’s selling petrol, there is . much less incentive for petrol stations to reduce their charges.’ And in a double blow for motorists, . he also warned petrol prices were expected to rise further as global . demand increased in the coming months. He said: ‘Larger companies will be . able to ride out the hikes, but many others will have to make a bleak . choice. Some motorists who can’t afford any more rises are simply going . to spend the same amount on fuel each month and stop driving when they . run out. ‘Others, especially tradesmen who . rely on using cars or vans, will either have to take it on the chin, or . pass it on to customers, which risks losing customers and potentially . going to the wall. It’s a very grim situation.’ The AA said average diesel prices . continue to fall, down from a year high of 146.46p a litre on March 4 to . 143.57p on Easter Monday. Record fuel prices were set in April last year, with petrol hitting 142.48p a litre and diesel 147.91p. AA president Edmund King said: ‘Fuel . pricing in the UK, US, and Europe over the past 12 months has been . characterised by a series of severe spikes, surging petrol prices up and . down by the equivalent of 10p a litre. This has had a severe impact on . consumer demand. ‘Although previous price spikes since . the 1970s have eventually been offset by improved wages, the extent and . severity of price swings since 2008 are likely to have a lasting . impact.’ He added: ‘Unlike the US, drivers in the UK and Europe have been left high and dry by the lack of fuel price transparency. ‘This has denied them the ability to . spot short-term pump price spikes. It has also allowed retailers to . decide when and where savings for this essential part of family spending . are passed on.’","Some retailers failing to pass on a dip in wholesale petrol costs, claim AA .

Probe: A driver is to be charged with five sex offences as part of the investigation triggered by allegations of abuse against Jimmy Savile (pictured) A driver was today charged with five sex offences as part of the investigation triggered by allegations of abuse against Jimmy Savile. David Smith, of Lewisham, south-east London, is accused of two counts of indecent assault, two of gross indecency and one of sexual assault in 1984, the Crown Prosecution Service said. The 66-year-old is the first person to be charged under Operation Yewtree, the national investigation prompted after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Savile. Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: ‘The CPS has carefully considered the evidence gathered as part of Operation Yewtree in relation to David Smith, who was employed as a driver at the time of the allegations. ‘The CPS received a file of evidence on December 21 2012. Further enquiries were necessary and the result of those enquiries was received by the CPS on March 18. ‘We have concluded, in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and that it is in the public interest for David Smith to be charged with five offences.’ The charges are two counts of indecent assault on a boy under 14 between June 1 and July 21 1984; two counts of gross indecency with a boy under 14 between the same dates and sexual assault of a boy under 16 between July 1 and 21 1984. Smith, who was arrested last December, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 8. Scotland Yard confirmed that the counts relate to one victim. The force led Operation Yewtree, . and separated its inquiries into those involving 'Savile', those involving 'Savile . and others', and those involving 'others'. Smith was probed in the ’others’ strand. BBC News reported that Smith had worked as a driver for the broadcaster and possibly other employers. But a BBC press office spokesman said she was unable to confirm whether he had been employed by the organisation, as the Corporation's records do not go back as far as 1984.

Arrogant investment bankers at Barclays thought they were immune from the ‘ordinary rules’ of society, a withering independent report concluded yesterday. The scandal-hit lender has been accused of fostering a ‘winning at all costs’ culture and deserting its values in the relentless pursuit of growth. Huge bonuses lavished on investment bankers helped some ‘lose all sense of proportion and humility’, the report said. Scandal-hit: Barclays has been accused of fostering a ¿winning at all costs¿ culture and deserting its values in the relentless pursuit of growth . The staggering largesse of Barclays was also made clear. Between 2002 and 2009, 60 investment bankers shared average long-term performance-related bonuses totalling £170million every year – or just under £3million a year each over the period, according to the report. This came on top of their salaries, annual bonuses and other benefits. A tendency to push the rules to the limit was epitomised by its controversial tax avoidance unit – the Structured Capital Markets division – which generated an income of more than £1billion a year for the bank between 2007 and 2010, the report said. This division is being shut down by new chief executive Antony Jenkins as part of efforts to restore the lender’s bruised reputation. The independent report, spearheaded by veteran lawyer Anthony Salz, was commissioned in the wake of Barclays’ £290million fine last summer for rigging crucial Libor interest rates. But it also looked at a long list of scandals that have dogged the lender, from mis-selling payment protection insurance to customers, to its £7.7million fine in 2011 for duping elderly savers into gambling their nest-eggs in risky stockmarket investments. Mr Salz, the vice chairman of investment bank Rothschild, called for a raft of changes including stricter curbs on pay and better treatment of customers. Barclays chairman Sir David Walker said the 236-page document, which cost the bank almost £18million in fees, made ‘for uncomfortable reading in parts’. He added: ‘That is bound to be the case when one asks for an independent examination of this kind, and we must learn from the findings.’ Under scrutiny: The report focuses heavily on bumper awards paid out under former chief executive Bob Diamond, pictured . The report focused heavily on the bumper awards dished out to Barclays’ investment bankers under disgraced former chief executive Bob Diamond, who was promoted to the top job at the start of 2011 after running the investment bank for years. Mr Diamond amassed more than £100million in pay and perks between 2005 and his resignation in July last year following the interest rate-rigging scandal. The report said the six and seven-figure packages regularly handed out at the investment bank, Barclays Capital, ‘contributed significantly to a sense among a few that they were somehow unaffected by the ordinary rules’. It added: ‘A few investment bankers seemed to lose a sense of proportion and humility.’ Mr Diamond was feted at Barclays for turning Barclays Capital into a global giant after joining in 1996. But the report said the lender’s rapid expansion across a number of divisions in the years up to the financial crisis produced ‘cultural challenges’. It became increasingly dominated by the investment bank’s winning ‘at all costs’ culture. The report said: ‘Winning at all costs comes at a price: collateral issues of rivalry, arrogance, selfishness and a lack of humility and generosity.’ It added: ‘We believe a culture developed within Barclays, quite possibly derived originally from the investment bank, which came across to some as being ‘‘clever’’ or what some people have termed ‘‘too clever by half’’, even arrogant and aggressive.’","Barclays accused of fostering a 'winning at all costs' culture .

A mother has pleaded guilty to being drunk as she lost  control of her van, plunging it into a 30ft-deep reservoir and killing two five-year-old girls, including her daughter. Arlene Anna Hernandez, 22, pleaded guilty in Chula Vista, California to two . charges of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, causing great . bodily injury and drunken driving causing injury. The charges, which stem from the tragic crash on August 5 last year, could send her to prison for 12 years when she is sentenced on May 31. Hernandez had been at a 'playdate' with her daughter, Lesette Silva, and a friend, Eric Figueroa, and his daughter Guiliana on the day of the deadly crash. Grief: Arlene Anna Hernandez, pictured in court last August, has pleaded guilty to being intoxicated while driving, leading to a crash that killed her daughter and her friend, both 5 . She and Figueroa had allegedly shared a six-pack of beer as they watched the girls play at a park before Hernandez saw some skydivers and said she wanted to take her daughter for a closer look. The foursome piled into her van and began driving along eastbound Otay Lakes Road when Hernandez lost control of the vehicle, sending it plummeting down an embankment. The 2005 Kia Sedona overturned, landed on its roof in the water and, while the adults managed to scramble out, they could not reach their daughters who were wearing seatbelts in the back. U.S. Border Patrol agents and passersby pulled the girls from the submerged van, UT San Diego reported. They were flown to hospital in San Diego by helicopter but were both pronounced dead. Victims: Guiliana Figueroa (l) and Lesette Silva (r), Hernandez's daughter, drowned in the crash last August . 'Drunk': Hernandez, pictured with her daughter, had drunk at least three beers before driving the van . Officers at the scene reported . smelling alcohol on the adults' breaths, according to 10 News. Her . blood-alcohol level was at 0.13 per cent - more than 1.5 times the legal . limit. She told officers she had been . driving with one hand when she saw a rock in the road and swerved to . miss it, forcing the van off the road. But investigations found no tire . marks to confirm this. Hernandez cried throughout her brief court hearing following the crash last summer. 'Ms. Hernandez is very distraught about . what happened,' her attorney, Jonathan Jordan, said afterwards. Scene: The car veered down an embankment, flipped over and landed on its roof in this reservoir . Rescue attempt: Hernandez and Guiliana's father escaped but the girls were trapped inside. They were pulled out by emergency crews and airlifted to hospital, but pronounced dead . 'At this point it is very traumatic . experience, not only for her but a lot of other people involved. Allow . them to grieve and mourn their children, then we’ll see how this . case is going to shake out.' Guiliana's mother, Natasa Sierra, also attended the hearing but stayed silent.

Dementia sufferer Anne Grimshaw, 78, has been fitted with a tracking device nicknamed a ‘SatNan’ because she gets lost so often when out walking. Scroll down for video . Anne Grimshaw (right), who has dementia, has been given a tracking device which allows her daughter, Joanne Taylor (left), to find her if she gets lost . The transmitter, known as a Buddi, is attached to her keys and sends out an update on her position every five minutes. If she wanders too far from her . bungalow in Rochdale, or suffers a fall, her daughter receives a phone . call from the Buddi team. Mrs Taylor said the device, supplied by . Rochdale Council’s assisted technology department, had enabled the . great-grandmother to retain her independence rather than having to be . put in a home. ‘The police once brought her home when . she was found on the hard shoulder of the motorway. She doesn’t think . there is anything wrong but she gets completely lost. Ms Taylor says that the device has allowed her mother to avoid having to move into a nursing home . Before they had the device, Ms Taylor says she would have to go out looking for her mother up to five times a day .

We live near the moors and I was sick with worry.’ Mrs Taylor says others should consider a tracking device for their relatives. ‘There are thousands in my position whose lives would be changed if they knew about Buddi.’ Before she had the tracking device, Mrs Grimshaw (left) was found by police on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway . ‘We live near the moors and I was sick with worry, I can't put into words how I felt, I was really worked up and just kept crying, I thought the worse. She would even try and go out in the snow,’ she said. Following this incident, a desperate Ms Taylor began researching ways to track her mother - in particular she was looking for a mobile phone with a tracking app - and she came across Buddi. Ms Taylor said the system worked ‘in the nick of time’.

It is known as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and it lies 163,000 light years away - or 49.97 kiloparsecs to be precise. The LMC is a dwarf galaxy and it floats in space in a long and slow dance around the Milky Way - a similar relationship to that between Earth and our moon. Scroll down for video . This vibrant image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shows the Large . Magellanic Cloud, which scientists have calculated lies 163,000 . light years away - or 49.97 kiloparsecs to be precise . Vast clouds of gas within it slowly collapse to form new stars which in turn light them up in a riot of colours visible in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The small and irregular galaxy includes the Tarantula Nebula - the brightest stellar nursery in our cosmic neighbourhood - and is scattered with others, the most noticeable sign new stars are being born. The new finding, published in the journal Nature, could hold the key to determining the scale of the universe - a mystery that has dumbfounded the world's greatest minds for decades. Previous measures of this distance have had limited accuracy to around five to ten per cent but the latest is accurate to 2.2 per cent. Astronomer Dr Grzegorz Pietrzynski and colleagues said the distance of 49.97 kiloparsecs can be used to calibrate longer cosmic breadths. It could also improve the determination of the expansion rate of the universe - known as the Hubble constant. It is named after astronomer Edwin P Hubble who stunned the world in 1929 by discovering our universe has been growing continuously since its inception. This artist's impression shows an eclipsing binary star system. By studying how the light changes, and other properties of the system, astronomers can measure the distances to eclipsing binaries very accurately. A long series of observations of very rare cool eclipsing binaries has now led to the most accurate determination so far of the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighbouring galaxy to the Milky Way and crucial step in the determination of distances across the Universe. Determining the Hubble constant is critical for gauging the age and size of our universe, and the exact distance to the LMC is one of the largest uncertainties plaguing past measurements. Dr Pietrzynski, of Concepcion University in Chile, said they are confident they can improve further on the accuracy of their measurements. The researchers made their calculation by observing rare close pairs of stars - known as eclipsing binaries. The LH 95 stellar nursery in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is our nearest neighbouring galaxy . These pairs are gravitationally bound to each other and once per orbit - as seen from Earth - the total brightness from the system drops as each component eclipses its companion. By tracking these changes in brightness very carefully and also measuring the orbital speeds of the stars it's possible to work out how big the stars are and other information about their orbits. When this is combined with careful measurements of the apparent brightness, remarkably accurate distances can be determined. The study used 16 years-worth of observations to identify a sample of stars with extremely long orbital periods - perfect for calculating precise distances. This new measurement can be used to decrease the uncertainty in calculations of the Hubble constant to three per cent with prospects of improving this to a two per cent uncertainty in a few years. Dr Pietrzynski said: ‘In the era of precision cosmology it is essential to determine the Hubble constant to an accuracy of three per cent or better. ‘The LMC distance we derive from these systems is accurate to 2.2 per cent and provides a firm base for a three per cent determination of the Hubble constant with prospects for improvement to two per cent in the future.'","Large Magellanic Cloud is 163,000 light years away from us .

Action: Armed Forces Minister Andrew Robathan is suing the firm which made metal hip implants that he claims caused a tumour in his leg . Armed Forces Minister Andrew Robathan is to sue a firm that made a 'toxic' hip implant which left him with a tumour in his leg. Mr Robathan, has been left in constant pain and has difficulty even standing for long periods of time after he was fitted with the 'metal-on-metal' implant - which tests have showed can become warn down and poison the bloodstream. The former SAS officer, who served during the first Gulf War, is among tens of thousands of people to receive the implants, which were the subject of a health warning after it was found that tiny metal fragments could break off of them over time. Mr Robathan had an operation to resurface both of his hips seven years ago, when doctors inserted the ASR Hip System implant which is manufactured by DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. He developed a non-cancerous tumour at the top of . his leg, and was told by his doctor that it was linked to the implants, the Telegraph reports. The devices, which have been fitted to around 10,000 British patients, had already been recalled following safety fears by then. Health . watchdogs in 2012 said that those who had been fitted with them should undergo annual medical checks. DePuy had recalled its implants two years previously. Mr Robathan, 61 - who has been told he will have to have a double hip replacement, said that although the implants he was fitted with have been recalled, it is 'more tricky' to simply recall something that is 'stuck inside you.' 'At first I was resigned to the fact . that something had just gone wrong,' he told the Telegraph, 'but I went . from being resigned about the situation to being absolutely angry. Warning: More than 10,000 people in the UK were fitted with the metal-on-metal hip implants (stock picture) 'I am in contact with lawyers with a view to taking legal action,' he said. A DePuy spokesman said the firm regrets the ASR Hip System did not perform as expected for some patients and that it is committed to addressing medical costs directly associated with the recall, the Telegraph reports.

Stargazers in the northern hemisphere have finally had their first chance to view the first of two comets set to blaze through our skies in 2013. Comet C/2011 L4 PanSTARRS, already visible for weeks from the Southern Hemisphere, appeared to observers above the equator for the first time this week. Incredible pictures showed the comet blazing a trial above Southern California and Las Vegas last night, as it continued its long trek north as seen from Earth. Cosmic flyby: The comet PANSTARRS is seen in the evening sky off the western coast of Southern California, in Los Angeles, last night. The comet will be visible until the end of March . PanSTARRS is seen next to the waxing crescent moon: Already visible for weeks from the Southern Hemisphere, it appeared to observers above the equator for the first time this week . The first good viewing night for northerners was last night, when PanSTARRS appeared next to the crescent moon at dusk in the south-western sky. Prior to that, glare from the Sun had obscured the comet. PanSTARRS is on a 106,000-year orbit with a high inclination of 84.2 degrees with respect to the ecliptic, Universe Today reports. That means it is moving more or less parallel to the '0 Hour' line in Right Ascension - the same spot that will be occupied by the Sun at next week's Vernal Equinox - and is gaining elevation only slowly as nights pass. Bright lights: PanSTARRS, the bright dot in the top-right, passes over the Stratosphere Casino Hotel along with a waxing crescent moon over the Spring Mountains range last in Las Vegas, Nevada . At the moment PanSTARRS is only visible in the U.S. and Europe using binoculars or a telescope, but astronomers expect the first naked-eye sightings in the next few evenings. California astronomer Dr Tony Phillips said the comet's proximity to the moon will make it easier for novice sky watchers to find it. ‘Wait until the sun is fully below the horizon to scan for the comet in the darkening twilight,’ Dr Phillips advised. Omen? Pan-STARRS, left, is visible next to a crescent moon in the western sky after sunset over Westminster, Maryland . PanSTARRS' name is an acronym for the Hawaiian telescope used to spot it two years ago - the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System. The volcano-top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and comets that might be headed our way. - and in recent months there have been several. Like other comets of its type, PanSTARRS is thought to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a vast region containing millions of comets located more than two light years from the Sun. The apparent path of PanSTARRS over the course of March: The comet will appear to move through Pisces, Pegasus and Andromeda. From the UK it will be in the western and north-western evening sky . PanSTARRS travelled in towards the inner Solar system for millions of years, dormant for most of this time as a small nucleus made up of rock and ices. When comets approach the Sun, these . ices heat up, eventually turning to gases that jet out into space . together with dusty material to form a head or coma around the cometary . nucleus. A comet hurtling into our solar system from deep space could next year score a direct and cataclysmic impact on Mars, astronomers say. According to current calculations, comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the Red Planet. But the unpredictable nature of comet orbits, which can change as jet-like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the Sun, means it could pass further away, or veer into a direct collision course. Respected astronomer Phil Plait, author of Slate's Bad Astronomy blog, has calculated that even if the comet is just nine miles across - a low estimate - an impact with Mars would cause a one billion megaton explosion. That, he says, is 25million times larger than the largest nuclear weapon ever tested on Earth. Particles from the Sun (the so-called solar wind) blow the gases back in a straight tail, whilst sunlight exerts a pressure on the dust particles to create a curved tail. To find it in UK skies, stargazers will need a clear sky, ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon, according to the Royal Astronomical Society. 'After sunset the comet will be low down in the west and appear as a misty patch not far from the crescent Moon,' an RAS spokesman said. 'Using binoculars will make it easier to find and will certainly help identify the tails which should point up from the horizon. 'As the days pass, the comet will move away from the Sun and fade and light from the Moon will interfere more. 'At the same time however, PANSTARRS will be higher up, will be visible later in the night and so be seen in a darker sky. 'After its brief period of visibility, the comet will travel back out towards the depths of space where it will be only be detected by large telescopes.'

An image of PanSTARRS made by an Australian astronomer: The curved dust tail can be seen sweeping up from the coma on the left hand side of the image, while the straight gas tail runs upwards from left to right . PanSTARRS is only the first comet expected to light up our skies in the next year and a half. Comet ISON may come close to outshining the moon in November. It was discovered last September by Russian astronomers and got its acronym name from the International Scientific Optical Network. Scientists have also identified a comet that is hurtling into our solar system from deep in space, and which could next year hit Mars with potentially catastrophic force. According to current calculations, comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the Red Planet.

A gas station in Queens, New York has remarkably been open for 145 years and has changed throughout the centuries from a blacksmith shop to an auto body shop, and is now run by the founder’s great-great grandson. John Farrington, 56, co-owns Farrington Service Station with his brother Michael and said it has been a pleasure to be an institution in the neighborhood for nearly a century and a half. Fuel for thought: Farrington's Service Station in College Point opened in 1868, three years after the end of the American Civil War . Old timey: John Farrington's great-grandfather pictured with his race horse; the station began as a blacksmith shop that made custom horseshoes for race horses . New management: A picture of the station when it was operated under Sinclair . Speaking with MailOnline from his home in College Point, Mr Farrington was bursting with pride to speak of the family business, which was established only three years after the end of the American Civil War. ‘The gas station was started by my great-great grandfather William Farrington, but my great-grandfather John Farrington stands out the most,’ he said, adding that it was his great-grandfather who is in the majority of pictures that line the shop’s interior. The business started out as a blacksmith where Farrington would create specialized racing horseshoes and fit them to the horses’ hooves. The owner was also an avid racer himself, and owned several horses. The first John Farrington was born in 1873, and took over the family trade around the turn of the 20th century. It was this Farrington who saw the surge in popularity with the new-fangled ‘horseless carriages,’ which, of course, evolved into the modern-day motorcar. The service station, as it exists now, is not the original building, Mr Farrington said. ‘We think from the things we’ve seen on the records that around 1917 to 1920, they converted to a gas station, because cars started taking over in the area.’ When MailOnline visited the site, Mr Farrington was not at the shop, which was staffed by brothers Doug and Fred Otto, who have worked at the station for the last 30 years, Fred as Farrington's Service Station Manager and Doug as a pump attendant. Somewhere out there: The service station is located in the College Point neighborhood of Queens and is only accessible by car or bus . If walls could talk: The interior of the station shows dozens of old black and white pictures documenting the station's rich history . Brotherly love: Doug, left, and Fred, right, are brothers who have worked for Farrington's Service Station for the last 30 years; Fred as Farrington's Service Station Manager and Doug as a pump attendant . He said they ripped down the old blacksmith shop to build the new gas station. A second building was constructed next door during the Great Depression to house more vehicles. Mr Farrington said that his luck has everything to do with the common sense that previous generations taught him. ‘We’ve gone from horses to gas stations, we’ve gone through depressions and recessions. We believe in putting (money) away in good times and saving it for the bad times.’ He continued: ‘My grandfather used to always say, you always gotta run scared, because it’s when you don’t worry about something that you forget about the lean times. 'They came through the Depression, and they never forgot those kinds of things. If we ever had money for business, my grandfather would always pay it off twice as fast.’ The Farringtons have a history in New York spanning several centuries – before the U.S. had even been formed. Mr Farrington said that 10 generations back, a Farrington served as Magistrate for the area that is now College Point. Varied history: Fred Otto, Farrington's Service Station Manager, has worked for Farrington's for the last 30 years . Hot to trot: Specialized racing horseshoes made by the first John Farrington are displayed in the building . On the job: Fred Otto answers a call at the station . Growing up in the working middle-class neighborhood, Mr Farrington remembered spending his childhood alongside his brother at the gas station while their father, George, ran the business. 'My grandfather always said never sell your luck, so we have no intentions of getting rid of the station.' ‘It was nice,’ he said. ‘In the 60s, when they had the Hot Rods and the racing cars, and everybody came in with their fancy Nomads, the GTOs. They used to come into the gas station – we loved that because we’d go for rides.’ The gas station, he explained, became a popular hang-out spot, where car owners could get a tune-up, a check-up, or even $2 worth of gas, which in the day, went a lot farther. ‘When I was really young, gas prices were all over the place. I remember at one time 35 cents a gallon, probably in the late 60s. I remember going out as a kid, asking for $2 of gas. The pumps then were so slow, you felt like you were standing there forever,’ he said. Then: The station after they switched to Gulf as a fuel provider; they've also operated under Sinclair and BP . Now: An exterior view of Farrington's Service Station and George Farrington's home behind the station . Their father passed away this Valentine’s Day at the age of 83. The son said that he is running the family business to pay homage to him. The station has also been through several providers, beginning with Sinclair, moving on to BP, and finally settling on Gulf. He told the New York Post that things began getting tough in the past few years, with skyrocketing delivery costs through Gulf that threatened to put the family-owned business in the red. But Mr Farrington found a friend who sells him gas directly, allowing him to sell his 70,000 or 80,000 gallons per month at 10 to 15 cents lower than any of his competitors. It's electric: A neon sign showing the establishment date is displayed in the window; Mr Farrington said that he'll wait and see what the future brings with the advent of electric and hybrid cars . Major award: The College Point Board of Trade presented this plaque to the station in 2001 after 133 years of support to the community . Give or take: Doug, one of Farrington's Service Station pump attendants, wears a Farrington's jacket with a Ford Model T embroidered on it, saying it was founded before the Civil War . ‘It’s been beneficial for us to work together,’ Mr Farrington said. ‘Gasoline doesn’t make you a lot of money today, but we did it for our customer’s sake,’ he said, adding that generations of College Point residents look to the family business as a neighborhood institution. He said he doesn't know of any other gas station in the city with such a long and unique history. As far as the future is concerned, Mr Farrington said he’s waiting to see what happens with hybrid and electric cars. ‘It’s too vague right now for the future, but we own the property. If everything changes and we start landing helicopters, or if it’s like the Jetsons with flying cars whizzing down the street, we’ll adapt to it,’ he said, noting that his family has been malleable to the changing times. ‘My grandfather always said never sell your luck, so we have no intentions of getting rid of it.’","Farrington Service Station has been owned and operated by same family since its opening nearly 150 years ago .

Land's End marks the northern tip of Britain, Hadrian's Wall is in Cornwall and the Jurassic Coast is in Scotland. That's the view of millions of Britons whose lack of geographical knowledge was highlighted in new research. The report also showed how little people know about other famous areas of Britain like the Lake District and the Isle of Man. More than a third of those under 30 thought Land's End was in the north when really it marks the southern-most tip of the country . Nearly one in 10 people believe the Lake District is nearest to Newcastle, while one in five think the Isle of Man is in the English Channel. A poll of 1,000 people by Virgin Trains found a woeful lack of general knowledge among Britain's young people. More than a third of those under 30 thought Land's End was in the north when really it marks the westernmost tip of the English mainland. And a north-south divide really does exist with two in three Londoners unsure about which towns and cities are nearest to the Lake District. A reliance on modern technology such as Google maps, satellite navigation and internet route finders is being blamed for significant numbers of people having a blinkered view of their country. Technology such as sat nav, Google maps and route finder websites mean that people can almost point and go these days, without having to know the geography of the country . Social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter also mean that people often keep in touch with friends without travelling to visit them. The poll quizzed people aged 16 to 60-plus on the location of some famous areas of Britain, how long it took to travel between some cities and typical train journey times. A total of 45 per cent of people did not know that Carlisle in Cumbria is nearer to the Lake District than Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, Oxford, Leeds and Manchester. Eight per cent thought it was nearest to Newcastle, five per cent said Oxford and two per cent even said Cardiff in Wales. Ignorance about the Lake District location was highest among under 30s with 54 per cent not knowing it was nearest to Carlisle. And Londoners were least knowledgeable about the Lake District with only 34 per cent knowing its location. Nearly half of those questioned (47 per cent) did not know that Inverness in Scotland was the most northerly city compared to Aberdeen, Cardiff, Portsmouth and Leeds. That figure rose to 54 per cent among people aged under 30, said Virgin Trains. A third (33 per cent) of those polled did not know that the Isle of Man was in the Irish Sea, placing it in the English Channel (21 per cent), North Sea (nine per cent) and Atlantic (three per cent). While 68 per cent correctly said the Jurassic Coast is in Dorset and Devon, 12 per cent placed it in Scotland, seven per cent in Northumberland or north Wales and six per cent in Norfolk. More than one in five Britons thought Hadrian's Wall divided either Devon and Cornwall, Yorkshire and Lancashire, England and Wales and even north and south London. A total of 78 per cent correctly said it was nearest to the border between England and Scotland. While 87 per cent rightly said Land's End was in the south of the UK, 13 per cent said it was in the north, rising to a third of those aged under 30. More than seven in 10 Brits thought a typical train journey between Manchester and London took between three and five hours, compared to the real time of just over two hours. Just 21 per cent of people correctly said the train journey time from Oxenholme in the Lake District to London was three hours. Twelve per cent thought the journey was more than five hours. Six in 10 people did not know that trains can reach speeds of 125mph on journeys between London and Manchester. Arthur Leathley, communications director of Virgin Trains, said: 'Our research shows that significant numbers of people in Britain are vague about the location of some of our most famous landmarks.

A lesbian from Uganda was asked by a British immigration judge trying to determine if she was actually homosexual whether she had ever read any works by author Oscar Wilde, it emerged today. The woman - from the African nation where it is illegal to be gay - was asked the question, according a university researcher who has interviewed 11 lesbian women from socially-conservative countries. Claire Bennett of the University of Southampton said she had found that gay women from the likes of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Jamaica regularly faced ‘inappropriate and insensitive’ questioning. Concerns: Claire Bennett of the University of Southampton said that she found gay women from the likes of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Jamaica regularly faced 'inappropriate and insensitive' questioning (file picture) ‘I thought I was quite unshockable just in terms of how dehumanising criminalising the whole asylum process is,’ former refugee camp worker Ms Bennett told the Independent. ‘I was wrong.’ Her research raises concerns over potential ignorance and prejudice among tribunal judges - one of whom is also said to have asked a lesbian immigration applicant whether she uses sex toys. Women she interviewed told her that many questions appeared to presume they had a similar gay lifestyle as somebody would in the West - despite coming from an entirely different culture. A Jamaican woman was told by a judge he did not believe she was gay because ‘you don't look like a lesbian’, and a Pakistani was asked which clubs she attended - despite being a teetotaller Muslim.

A drunken lout stole a school's pet chicken and posted pictures on Facebook of him posing with it at a houseparty. Anthony Campen, 29, kidnapped the chicken from a nearby primary school before dragging it to a houseparty where he posed with it before releasing it into the wild. Police used the pictures to force Campen to admit his crime after he posted a number of photos on Facebook. A court heard how Campen had carried the chicken to a houseparty in his rucksack before he posed for pictures with the startled bird. The partygoer then fed the chicken party snacks before releasing it into a nearby field.

Campen, from Chelmsford, Essex, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal sometime between January 26 and 28 this year 2012 when he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates Court on February 20. Magistrates were told of the distress caused to young children at the school who had lost a much-loved pet which they had raised from a chick as part of a school project.

George Osborne is believed to be ready to announce a new paid-for 14-mile stretch along the M4 near Newport in South Wales. However, the AA has criticised the plans saying it would deter people from using it because of the high costs. The only other toll-motorway in the UK is a 27-mile stretch of the M6 near Birmingham which costs £5.50 for cars and £11 for lorries. A new relief road in Wales could became the second toll motorway in Britain similar to the current section of the M6, pictured . AA president Edmund King said that M4 improvements were welcome but introducing tolls could deter motorists. He said: 'We have seen with the M6 Toll that drivers can be turned off by the imposition of charges. 'There is already a toll to get into . Wales on the Severn Crossing but no toll to get out. There is no doubt . that the M4 around Newport needs improving. At the moment if there is a . bad accident and the road is closed there is no real alternative for . drivers. George Osborne announced £3billion extra a year in infrastructure spending in last month's Budget . 'But if the road is tolled it reduces . its economic effectiveness as a lot of people will be put off using it . and will simply avoid it.' Funding for the construction of the . 14-mile M4 relief road, intended to tackle congestion around Newport, . will be guaranteed by the Treasury. The Welsh government will repay the . loan by charging drivers to use it. The Chancellor announced an extra . £3billion a year in infrastructure spending in last month's Budget. A . government source told the Times: 'This kind of big investment project . shows that we're serious about spending on infrastructure and helping . the whole country.' The plans for a relief road between . junctions 23 and 29 of the M4 were first proposed in 2004 and it was due . to open this year, but the scheme was scrapped in 2009 after its cost . rose to £1billion from its original £350million. Financial Times journalist Mickey . Clarke told BBC Radio Wales today: 'It's worth pointing out though that . the M6 Toll in the Midlands hasn't ever made any money. People won't pay . it. That's the trouble.' The plans for the road were . criticised in 2007 by the Gwent Wildlife Trust, which was concerned . about potential damage to the wetlands which are home to rare plants, . otters and birds. Other schemes Mr Osborne is looking at include improvements to the A303 - the road that passes Stonehenge in Wiltshire. Other projects may include making all the section of the A1 north of Newcastle dual carriageway and improvements to the A47 in Norfolk. Mr King said: 'Bits of the A1 north of Newcastle are dual carriageway and bits are single carriageway. It certainly needs dualling although the Highways Agency has pointed out that traffic flows are far less heavy than those south of Newcastle. 'The A47 in Norfolk is an accident black spot so improvements there would be welcome.'","Chancellor 'set to announce new toll road along the M4 in South Wales'

Lance Armstrong kicked back with Willie Nelson last night, clearly making the most of his time since admitting that he won numerous cycling titles with the help of doping and performance-enhancing drugs. The disgraced athlete shared with his Twitter followers that he had met the country crooner and his wife Annie Nelson for dinner last night in Texas. The cyclist is on an apparent PR blitz as he tries to rebuild his image following his notorious confession to Oprah Winfrey back in January. Bros: Lance Armstrong poses with country music legend Willie Nelson in a photo posted to Twitter on Tuesday night . Armstrong posted a photo from the friendly meeting, saying: 'Fun dinner with Annie and @willienelson. Lost my #mellow hat to Willie tho. Great man, great friend, great Texan.' The 'mellow' hat worn by Nelson in the photo is emblazoned with the logo for Mellow Johnny's Bike Shop in Austin, Texas, which is owned by Armstrong. Speculation has grown about whether Armstrong will face charges relating to his history of doping. He is also waiting for a number of things to resolve themselves - one federal investigation did not result in charges - but there are two more that are forthcoming. Armstrong has been sued by former teammate Floyd Landis and he is reportedly being investigated by the FBI for witness tampering, obstruction of justice and intimidation. Dallas-based production company SCA Promotions is suing for $12million in bonuses and the Sunday Times of London wants $1.5m back it paid him in a libel settlement. Singer and the cyclist: Nelson and Armstrong have both faced legal mishaps involving drugs . Nelson is also no stranger in legal issues relating to drugs, as he's been arrested numerous times for marijuana possession. He openly lobbies for legalization of cannabis. A week ago, Armstrong looked eager to get back into the public eye at Mastro's restaurant in Beverly Hills, days after it was reported that two films about his life are currently in development. The restaurant is a known celebrity hangout that's always teaming with paparazzo. Perhaps that was Armstrong's goal, as he happily agreed to take photos with young fans who stopped him outside. TMZ has reported that Armstrong was asked about the two biopics - one by J.J. Abrams for Paramount and another by Jay Roach for Warner Bros. - but he would not comment.

Armstrong said that he saw the former president's rehabilitation as a model for his own, and he'll be back on top in a decade. Speaking to Texas Monthly, he said: 'Ultimately, people forgive and forget and remember the good stuff you did. 'Is it hard to do? Yeah.

Prime Minister David Cameron today congratulated Mini makers BMW as the company marked the 100th anniversary of car production at Oxford. It was on March 28, 1913 that the Cowley plant produced its first car - the Bullnose Morris Oxford. Today, Mr Cameron said: 'The Government is working closely with the automotive industry so that it continues to compete and thrive in the global race, and the success of Mini around the world stands as a fine example of British manufacturing at its best.' Drive: Workers fitting engines and back axles at the Cowley plant at Oxford, where cars have been made for 100 years . Cowley has turned out such iconic models as the MG, the Wolseley, the Riley, the Austin and, in 1959, the Mini . He added: 'The substantial contribution which the Oxford plant has made to the local area and the British economy over the last 100 years is something we should be proud of.' The Cowley plant has produced more than 11 million vehicles in its 100 years. Celebrating the milestone today, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and Harald Krueger, member of the board of management of BMW AG, opened a centenary exhibition at the plant. Mr McLoughlin viewed the new bodyshop and some of the 1,000 new robots being installed in this facility. It represents the lion’s share of BMW Group’s £750 million UK investment programme, preparing the company’s manufacturing facilities for the next generation Mini. Mr McLoughlin said: 'A thriving automotive sector is central to this Government’s commitment to driving economic growth. 'By creating jobs and exporting British-made products to global markets, Mini is sending a clear message that this country is open for business.' Models: Some of the cars that have been built in Oxford, including the iconic Mini Cooper and Morris Minor . The Cowley plant has produced more than 11 million vehicles in its 100 years . The plant was originally owned by William Morris, one of the great names of British motoring, who later became Lord Nuffield. Cowley - a small district of Oxford - became a world-famous factory, turning out such iconic models as the MG, the Wolseley, the Riley, the Austin and, in 1959, the Mini. Mr Cameron said: 'The Government is working closely with the automotive industry so that it continues to compete and thrive in the global race' William Morris owned the factory directly and then through Morris Motors until 1952 when Morris merged with rival Austin to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC). Before that, Cowley did its bit for the war effort in the Second World War by building Tiger Moth aircraft, ambulances and military trucks as well as carrying out repairs on damaged Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft. BMC became British Motor Holdings in 1967 after merging with Jaguar and in 1968 the company merged with the Leyland Truck Company to form British Leyland Motor Corporation. Troubled times followed its nationalisation in the mid-70s, with the UK motor industry suffering damaging strikes and large corporate losses. The company eventually became the Rover Group in 1986 and was sold to British Aerospace in 1988, with German company BMW taking over in 1994. In 2001, BMW started producing a new, more powerful version of the Mini and the brand has enjoyed a new lease of life. At one time in the 1960s, Cowley employed as many as 28,000 employees. Perhaps keen to disassociate itself with the strike-ridden days of old, BMW decided to drop the Cowley name when it took over, referring to the factory as Plant Oxford. Today, Oxford employs 3,700 staff who manufacture up to 900 Minis a day.

Drivers are set to face a financial squeeze over the coming weeks, as the price of petrol will rise while the economy continues to struggle. George Osborne attempted to ease the pain in last week's Budget by cancelling a proposed 3p increase in fuel duty, but the move appears to have had little effect. The average petrol price has risen by 5.5 per cent in just two months, with a 4p rise in February, meaning that in some parts of Britain it costs £100 to fill up the family car. Pain at the pumps: The cost of petrol has risen by 4p a litre over the past month alone . The price hike has been attributed to . high global oil prices as well as the fall in the value of the pound, . which makes imports more expensive. But research from Santander Cards suggests that no respite is on the horizon, with the cost of fuel set to rise again in the short term. The average price of a litre of petrol nationwide is currently 137.95p, with a litre of diesel costing 129.9p on average. According to Santander, that means a motorist who drives 1,000 miles a month in a car going 35 miles per gallon must spend £180 per month on transport. On the rise: Prices dropped in the final months of 2012 but jumped again in January, February and March . 'With the cost of fuel expected to . reach its highest level in the coming weeks, families and car commuters . are likely to be the hardest hit once again,' said Alan Mathewson, chief . executive of Santander Cards. 'Aside . from mortgage costs, households in the UK already spend more on . transport than any other living cost. Further hikes may well push many . family budgets over the edge.

An 'Aladdin's Cave' of stolen goods was unveiled today by police after they smashed a black market car parts racket operating on eBay. Hundreds of parts were stripped from stolen vehicles then itemised and stored in a warehouse before being posted for sale on the internet auction site as 'scrapyard seconds.' Police raided Ramzan Ahmed's premises in Bolton after noticing components sold by his online firm Permanent Discounts were suspiciously clean and undamaged - and discovered the stolen car parts together with a cannabis factory. The 34-year-old was sentenced to four years in prison after admitting cannabis production and 14 counts of handling stolen goods. Theft: This warehouse full of stolen car parts in Bolton was discovered after police smashed an illegal operation run by Ramzan Ahmed . Operation: Hundreds of parts were stripped from stolen vehicles then itemised and stored in the lock-up before being posted for sale on the internet auction site as 'scrapyard seconds' Find: Among the parts found were wheels, engines, car seats, exhaust pipes, windscreens and chassis of more than a dozen stolen vehicles . Police raided the former IT worker's premises in Bolton, Greater Manchester on March 17, 2011 and uncovered a huge array of items looted from cars and other vehicles stolen across the North of England. They including wheels, engines, car seats, exhaust pipes, windscreens and chassis of more than a dozen stolen vehicles, which were in various stages of being taken apart. Police searched Ahmed, 34, to find he had with him a set of keys to another unit next door. Guilty: Ramzan Ahmed was jailed for four years after admitting to cannabis production and 14 counts of handling stolen goods . When they opened the second unit they discovered a large cannabis factory of 323 plants capable of producing a yield of almost 13kg of cannabis. Sold on the streets the cannabis was worth up to £135,000. Ahmed's fingerprints were also found on cannabis production equipment inside the factory. Details of the find emerged at Bolton Crown Court where Ahmed of Bury was jailed for four years. Vanessa Thomson, prosecuting, told how Ahmed first came to the attention of the police special investigation branch in 2011 after officers noticed components from relatively new cars were being sold on eBay by his company called Permanent Discounts. Amongst the large number of car parts stored at Unit 10, were doors, tailgates, bumpers and other parts from at least 14 stolen vehicles, including a Lexus, Mazda RX8, a Toyota RAV4 and three BMW 5 series. The total value of the stolen cars identified was at more than £130,000. Shortly after the raids Ahmed arrived only to drive away when he spotted the police. He was arrested a short time later on the M602. In mitigation defence lawyer Shirlie Duckworth said the father-of-three Ahmed had initially set up a legitimate car parts business after losing his job as an IT worker with Fujitsu. When it proved to be unsuccessful he found he was 'unable to resist' when thieves approached him offering to sell him stolen cars.

Real-life: Nine trainee first-aiders were pressed into emergency action when their course was interrupted by a crash outside the training centre where they were being taught in Lincolnshire . One of the first on the scene of the crash was training manager Mike Johnson. The 59-year-old said the trainee first-aiders followed him into action to help the casualty during the emergency, which happened at about 4pm on Tuesday. He said: 'We heard the collision outside and saw that the traffic had all come to a halt. So we put our action plan into operation, got our receptionist to call the emergency services and immediately got our trainees on the scene directing traffic. 'We did the best we could to help the casualty, who was trapped upside-down in his overturned car. But the trainees grabbed fluorescent jackets and did a splendid job stopping the traffic and turning it round as the road was blocked in both directions.

First-aid trainee Glyn de Lacy, 62, said his colleagues were only too happy to help when the crash happened. He said: 'We were on the course when the accident took place right outside the centre. It was the best lesson we all had, actually learning it for real. We directed the traffic away from the accident while another [person] called the emergency services.' After being freed by firefighters, the driver, from Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, was taken to Lincoln County Hospital. Lincolnshire Police spokesman Deborah Owen said: 'The car ended up on its roof and the driver received injuries which were not thought to be life-threatening.'

British phone fans eagerly awaiting Samsung's eight-core Galaxy S4 will be disappointed after it emerged the UK version will ship with a downgraded processor. The latest version of the South Korean company's flagship smartphone will arrive on these shores with a only quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 CPU, the Samsung has admitted. Other markets will benefit from an 1.6GHz Exynos 5 octa-core processor, which is the thought to be the most powerful chip yet squeezed into a mobile phone. Crippled: The Galaxy S4 seen at the unveiling event in New York. It is emerged that the UK version of Samsung's flagship phone will ship with a four-core chip, rather than the eight-core chip expected . Samsung had previously said the S4's chip would vary between markets, but it was understood the UK would be one of those where the eight-core processor would be available. A Samsung spokesman told Trusted Reviews: 'Samsung Galaxy S 4 is equipped with a 1.9GHz Quad-core AP or a 1.6GHz Octa-core AP. The selection of AP varies by markets.' The spokesman added that 'in the UK the Galaxy S4 will be available as a 4G device with a 1.9GHz Quad Core Processor.' It is as yet unclear why Samsung has chosen to downgrade the processor for British consumers, although 3G speculated that it could be because the Exynos 5 is incompatible with 4G networks. Other markets where the S4 is expected to ship with the Qualcomm chip include the U.S., Canada and Sweden. Pride: JK Shin, Samsung's president and head of IT and mobile communications, shows off the Galaxy S4 in each of its two colours . However, while some Samsung fans will be disappointed with the firm's decision, speed benchmark tests have shown that even with the Snapdragon chip the S4 will be twice as fast as the iPhone 5, TechDigest reported. The main concern expressed so far over the drop to four cores is that the downgraded phone is likely to have less battery life than its eight core sibling. The Exynos chip, which contains four high-powered cores and four slower cores, is thought to be able to pass over less-intensive tasks to less power hungry sections of the chip - a trick processor developer ARM calls big.LITTLE. The feature-packed S4, with its always-on cameras tracking users' eye movements and the like, is expected to be exceptionally tough on battery life. It is possible that the UK's S4 will be upgraded to an eight-core model later, but Samsung has as yet said nothing to indicate that might be the case.","UK version will ship with quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 CPU .

Stark warning: Former teen conman Frank Abagnale says the personal details revealed by millions on Facebook enable identity theft . The famous former teenage conman whose exploits were immortalised in the Hollywood blockbuster Catch Me If You Can has issued a stark warning about the dangers of Facebook. Frank Abagnale, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Steven Spielberg film, said that the personal information revealed by millions on the social network is a rich seam for identity thieves. Children in particular need to be made aware of the serious risks of unwittingly revealing personal information online, he added. Once dubbed the world's greatest conman, Mr Abagnale spent half his teenage years on the run as a confidence trickster, imposter, cheque forger and escape artist in the Sixties. The 64-year-old is now a security consultant for US law enforcement agencies -  including the FBI -  having switched sides when he was eventually caught. He said Facebook gives away too much personal information about you and this can allow con artists and impersonators to use your history of ‘likes’ to discern your personal info, lifestyle choices and personality traits. He also warned against using ‘passport style’ photos as profile picture and said being pictured in group photos was safer. ‘If you tell me your date of birth and where you’re born on Facebook, I’m 98 per cent of the way to stealing your identity,’ he told the Guardian. ‘Never state your date of birth and where you were born on personal profiles, otherwise you are saying “come and steal my identity”,’ he warned.

Frank Abagnale spent half his teenage years in the Sixties on the run as a confidence trickster, imposter, cheque forger and escape artist. He became one of the most famous impostors ever, claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight identities. He escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary), before he was 21 years old. He served fewer than five years in prison before starting to work for the federal government and is currently a consultant and lecturer for the FBI academy and field offices. He also runs Abagnale & Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company.

Tough love: Ohio businessman Ron Kronenberger was charged with assault after allegedly whipping his tenant. He is now accused of attacking a second man . An Ohio landlord accused of whipping a tenant with a belt on his bare buttocks for falling behind on his rent - is alleged to have beat another man with a belt and a paddle. When Ron Kronenberger's tenant failed to come . up with $2,800 in back rent, the Ohio businessman allegedly did what . many landlords can only dream of: he took off his belt and gave the . 29-year-old a whipping. He is now accused of beating a second man - who is believed to be mentally disabled - with a belt and a paddle at his office at a supermarket. This time the accusations came in a lawsuit filed this week in Warren County, according to the Dayton Daily News. Kronenberger is alleged to have attacked the first man in his office on January 22. Police in the village of Waynesville said the 53-year-old was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault stemming from the bizarre altercation in the back office of his supermarket. According to officials, angered that the tenant had failed to come up with the considerable rent payment, Kronenberger told him that if he was going to act like a child, he would treat him like one. He then allegedly hit him four times with a belt, leaving 'small marks’ on his rear. Police say the tenant later told them he was scared and just wanted to get it over with, so he complied with Kronenberger’s demand to bend over, placing his hands on a chair. An arrest report states that when confronted by Police Chief Gary Copeland, Kronenberger admitted to whipping his tenant. 'Spanking scene': Police say the 29-year-old victim came into Kronenberger's back office inside Hometown Market, where the business owner told him to bend over . The Dayton Daily News reported that Kronenberger, who owns Hometown Market in town, is a former chamber of commerce president who was voted in 2006 as Waynesville's Citizen of the Year. Residents in the small community of 2,800 were shocked by the arrest of the prominent local businessman, but some told ABC22 that they can understand his frustration with the insolvent tenant. A magistrate said he would dismiss . the assault charge in six months if Kronenberger has no contact with the . tenant and stays out of trouble. Police say they have no record of the second incident. Kronenberger and his lawyer declined to comment.","Ohio businessman Ron Kronenberger allegedly whipped disabled man .

The depths of Mick Philpott's sexual depravity were revealed today in a sickening prison letter which told how he and his wife planned to celebrate their freedom by 'raping each other' after visiting their children's graves. Philpott penned the letter to friends Mick and Sharon Russell while awaiting trial for the manslaughter of the six youngsters. It tells how he intended to get drunk with his wife and accomplice Mairead before 'spending the whole day with our babies at the graveside.' But in a disturbing conclusion to what should be a time of grief, he continues: 'We don't care if its raining, gale . force winds, snowing, I'm going straight up there, then we shall . probably, no, we will, rape each other... then we can all celebrate our . freedom.' In the most tasteless way imaginable, the sick words were written with drawings of eight pink hearts, one each for him and his wife and six others for the children they killed. Scroll down for video . Depraved: This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield holds a letter which Mick Philpott sent to friends while he was in custody awaiting trial for killing six of his children in a house fire . Sickening: This passage in the letter tells how Philpott and his wife planned to celebrate their freedom by 'raping each other' after visiting their children's graves . Lack of remorse: Six wooden crosses mark the graves of the Philpott children which Philpott intended to visit after his release from prison, but not before getting drunk first . The godfather to three of Mick Philpott's children today said he felt 'angry and deceived' by his close friend after he was found guilty of killing six of his children in a house fire. Andrew Allsop, pictured, told ITV's Daybreak: 'He's taken so many lives. 'He's taken my godchild, the other children that called me uncle, my wife auntie. How could I forgive him for doing that.' 'I'm very angry, my whole family is angry. We’ve gone through that much grief with people sort of blaming us because we were friends with him. 'It’s not our fault, we didn’t mean this to happen to the children. 'It's devastating. It's not just we've suffered but lots and lots of people have suffered.' Mr and Mrs Russell said they were . shocked by the language used, telling ITV's This Morning programme they . couldn't believe his mind would be 'craving sex' after visiting . the graveyard. Philpott pursued a twisted love life with Mairead and his former live-in partner, Lisa Willis, at the home they shared in Allenton, Derby. He boasted how he would sleep with the women on alternate nights in a rusting caravan parked outside the house as they tended to his every need. But the bizarre love triangle fell apart when Miss Willis decided to flee his clutches and took five of their children with her. That prompted a bitter custody battle which ended with Philpott's appalling attempt to frame her for the fire which killed six of his other children. Far from being distraught by the tragedy, Mr and Mrs Russell told how Philpott was having a 'laugh and joke' while visiting his . children's bodies in the mortuary. On hearing news of the blaze, Mr Russell said: 'I jumped in the car and went . straight down to Mick's mum and I found out where he was, I phoned the . hospital and said ""can I come down"" and he said ""please come down Mick"" and we went there.' When he arrived, he found Philpott not crying, but flirting with his wife. Appalled: Mick Philpott's long-term friends Mick and Sharon Russell appear on This Morning with former MP Ann Widdecombe to discuss their relationship with the house-blaze killer . More interested in celebrating than grieving: Mr Schofield reads a passage from the letter, which also told how Philpott intended to get very drunk as soon as he left prison . He said: 'I was walking down the corridor and me and Sharon was in . front and he was behind us and he said ""hey Mick"" I looked round and he . was grabbing his girl's bum saying this is what he liked. 'I was . thinking ""you've just lost six kids Mick, what are you doing?""' On their visit to the mortuary, Mrs Russell said: 'He was crying but there were no tears. Same with Mairead. Mr Russell added: 'I just burst out crying and Mick just said 'I'll deal with it my own way.""' When it came to the funeral, Mrs Russell said Mairead appeared more concerned about what dress she was going to wear and described the wake as an 'after party'. Mrs Russell said: 'She was going to wear this certain outfit for the funeral, and I was quite shocked at it and said ""you can't wear that"". 'She said ""will it be alright for the after party?"" I was like ""the after party, what do you mean an after party?"" 'It was disgusting the way they were behaving.' Twisted couple: Mick Philpott with his wife Mairead, who friends say did not appear remorseful after the deaths of six of their children . Facing jail: Mick and Mairead Philpott in court for the mitigation hearing ahead of their sentencing tomorrow . Mr Russell, who has known Philpott . for around 20 years, said he never felt comfortable leaving his wife . alone with the father-of-17 because of his rampant sex drive. He told This Morning: 'I wouldn't leave Sharon in the room . with him on his own because he's very highly sex-drived and if he saw a . pretty woman he'll try and chat her up.' Mick . said, 'I've known him for about twenty years, and I've been on a number . of programmes to defend him... I just can't believe how he's conned . me.' Mrs Russell, who knew the Philpott family for 12 years, said: 'I thought the way he lived was bizarre and he was a very controlling person, very controlling towards Lisa and Marie. He controlled them. He thought they were his property.' She added: 'The children were happy, but he never took them on outings or anything, or to the park, even to the shops, none of that. 'Those kids were always in the house. And she [Mairead] just did the basic things really for the kids - made sure they were dressed for school, cooked them dinner, but never one to one with the children.' Mr Russell went on to say how they appeared to enjoy the celebrity status they found themselves in. He said: 'He loved the fact that everybody knew him. He liked to be well known.'

Catherine Hickman, 31, died after she was told to stay in her flat during the fire in south London in 2009 . Three women and three children who died in a fire caused by a faulty television set could have been saved if basic safety checks had been carried out on their flats, an inquest ruled today. Southwark Council missed ‘numerous opportunities’ to check fire safety at Lakanal House in Camberwell, south London, before a blaze killed six people there in July 2009, jurors decided. Catherine Hickman, 31, Dayana Francisquini, 26, and her children, Thais, six, and Filipe, three, were killed in the blaze along with Helen Udoaka, 34, and her daughter Michelle, who was just 20 days old. In six narrative verdicts read out at Lambeth Town Hall today, jurors agreed that the flats had inadequate protection to stop the spread of fire from one home to another. Fire safety issues could have been . spotted in major works during the1980s and again between 2006 and 2007, . it was heard - and the replacement of asbestos window panels with . non-fireproof ones in 2006 had a 'serious impact' on how the blaze . spread. Reading out the narrative verdict, a . juror said: 'There were numerous opportunities to consider whether level . of fire protection was adequate. 'In 2006 to 2007 there was major . refurbishment work which would have provided an opportunity to carry out . checks to ensure the level of fire protection was adequate. Despite a proactive approach, the council did not prioritise fire assessments.' The inquest heard that there were no fire seals on the front doors and there was a lack of fire stoppers on the pipe work. Commenting on how resistant the flats . were to fire, the jurors continued: 'This created a serious failure of . compartmentalisation. Had a fire risk assessment been carried out it is possible these failures could have been identified.' Inquest: Southwark Council missed 'numerous opportunities' to check fire safety at Lakanal House in Camberwell, south London, before a blaze killed six people there in 2009, jurors said today . Tragic: Dayana Francisquini with son Filipe, aged three, and daughter Thais, aged six (taken on her fourth birthday at home). All died in the tower block fire . Infant: Baby Michelle Udoaka, the three-week old daughter of Helen Udoaka, died in the Camberwell tower block inferno along with her mother . The fire brigade’s actions on the . day were also criticised, with jurors ruling that if firefighters had . known the layout of the building they could have saved the lives of the . three women and three children. 'Fire crews had little knowledge of the layout,' they said. 'If firefighters had been aware of the . precise location of the flats it would have been possible to seriously . reduce the fatal injuries. 'Confusion about the layout meant that the flats directly above the fire were not reached in time.' It was also acknowledged that it would have possible for all to escape . the building using balcony on the east side, but it was agreed that none . of the victims knew of this route. The inquest heard how the terrified victims had frantically called 999 . as thick smoke and flames quickly spread through the 14-storey block . engulfing their home. Despite their desperate pleas for help they were reassured that fire . crews were on their way and told to stay inside their flats. But firefighters were unable to save them. Emotional: Solicitor Louise Christian (left) listens as Mbet Udoaka (centre), and Rafael Cervi (right), who both lost loved ones in the fire, issue a statement outside Lambeth Town Hall following the inquest verdict . 'Confusion': London Fire Brigade Deputy Assistant Commissioner Tim Cutbill, right, issued a statement outside the town hall, where constituency MP and Labour Party Deputy Leader, Harriet Harman, left, was in attendance . Missed opportunities: Jurors said safety checks could have been carried out during the major refurbishment of the flats in 2006 and 2007 . Miss Hickman, a talented fashion designer who had worked with singer . Bjork, was on the phone to the fire brigade for almost an hour and told . to stay put until the call ended suddenly with her screams as she was . struck by burning debris. The five other victims had taken refuge in the 11th floor flat next to . Miss Hickman’s where they had been told to stay put and use towels in a . doomed bid to protect themselves from the smoke that steadily engulfed . the flat. Trapped inside the block with her 20 day old baby, Helen Udoaka, 34, phoned her husband to say ‘I can’t bear it anymore.' Relatives of the victims told the inquest how they were on the phone to . their loved ones during their final moments and desperately pleaded with . fire crews to rescue them before it was too late. In an emotional testimony, Rafael Cervi told how he called his wife . Dayana Francisquini, ten times and tried to alert firefighters to their . grave situation. Victims: Catherine Hickman lived in flat 79. The other victims perished in flat 81 where they had all taken refuge together . Blaze: The 14-storey building consisted of 98 maisonette flats. The fire reached the 11th floor where the victims lived . Findings: . The inquest heard how the terrified victims had frantically called 999 . as thick smoke and flames quickly spread through the 14-storey block . engulfing their home . Experts criticised the decision to tell the victims to stay inside their . flats and said those in jeopardy should have been told to flee the . building. Peter Holland, chief fire and rescue adviser to the Communities and . Local Government Department told the inquest the default policy should . have been to 'get out and stay out.' The inquest painted a picture of inadequate communication, missed . opportunities and apparent lack of forward planning which hindered . efforts to rescue the victims. Firefighters did not know and had not been told how people might be . rescued and did not have any plans of the complex building, jurors were . told. The inquest also heard that no valid fire risk assessment was in place . when the blaze erupted and that materials used to refurbish the 1950’s . tower block caught fire 'too quickly.' Community: Members of the public laying flowers outside the flats. The local community called for answers following the devastating fire . And the first fire chief on the scene at the fatal blaze admitted he did not know the escape routes out of the building. The ‘super inquest’ at Lambeth Town Hall lasted three months and heard evidence from 126 witnesses. No legal action was taken over the deaths after an extensive . investigation by Metropolitan Police and Southwark Council, which owns . the building. Prosecutors decided in May last year not to press manslaughter charges as there was no realistic prospect of conviction.","Blaze killed six people at Lakanal House in Camberwell, London, in 2009 .

That makes the South Korean rapper's breakthrough hit nearly twice as popular as the second place clip, the music video for Justin Bieber and Ludacris's hit track Baby. Mass appeal: South Korean rapper Psy in his music video for the track Gangnam Style, which is far and away the most popular video on YouTube, the video-sharing website which has hit the one billion users a month mark . Oooh, baby baby: Gangnam Style has been viewed nearly 1.5billion times on YouTube . The only clip in the top ten not promoting a recording industry artist was the perennially amusing Charlie Bit My Finger - again !, which was the sixth most watched of all time with nearly 520million views. No one artist had more than one video in the top ten and, other than the apparently universally appealing Gangnam Style, the only non-English language video was Brazilian folk singer Michel Teló's Ai Se Eu Te Pego!. YouTube announced it had reached the billion users a month milestone at a swish event last night aimed at advertisers and featuring performances from some of the website's biggest stars. Runner up: Baby, Canadian teen popper Justin Bieber's collaboration with southern U.S. rapper Ludacris, was the second most watched YouTube video of all time as the announcement was made . Charlie bit my finger - again! The super-cute viral video featuring two young brothers was the only video in YouTube's all-time top ten that doesn't feature a music industry artist . It crossed the threshold five months after online social network Facebook said it had reached that figure for the first time. The vast audience - up from 800million a month in October 2011 - has given YouTube's owner Google another lucrative channel for selling online ads beyond its dominant internet search engine. Google snapped up YouTube for $1.76billion (£1.16billion) in 2006 when the video site had an estimated 50million users worldwide. YouTube has since late 2011 refocused . its site to prioritise watching along distinct channels of its . creators. Such channels were seen as better allowing advertisers to . focus on certain genres of content like beauty or music. The . company in 2012 ploughed $100million (£659million) into funding 96 . channels to help them accelerate that growth, in many cases partnering . with big-name Hollywood producers and directors. Later, YouTube vowed to spend another $200million (£132million) marketing the channels to boost viewers. But . last night's event focused largely on stars who made it big through . YouTube before the new channel-funding strategy, such as Michelle Phan, a . video author who has been giving viewers make-up tips via the site . since 2006. Record-breaking: YouTube says more than one billion people are now visiting its online video site each month .

YouTube . vice-president Robert Kyncl, who is the company's global head of content . partnernships, admitted after the event that the channel funding . strategy had not worked as well as hoped. Asked whether the channel funding investment had paid off, Mr Kyncl said: 'Every year we reserve the right to get smarter.' While . YouTube was committed to continuing to invest in content, he said, more . of such investment in the future would go to those channels that had . already proven they can be successful at building an audience on their . own.

An extremely rare fossil of footprints made more than 300million years ago has been discovered by a 10-year-old schoolboy. Bruno Debattista, a pupil at Windmill Primary School in Oxford, brought a piece of shale with what he thought might be a fossilised imprint to the after-school club at Oxford University's Museum of Natural History. Astonished museum experts found it appeared to contain trackways left by a horseshoe crab crawling up the muddy slopes of an ancient shore around 320million years ago. Amazing find: Oxford schoolboy Bruno Debattista . holds up the piece of shale he found which experts say contains the . fossilised footprints made by a pair of mating horseshoe crabs . 300million years ago . Well spotted: A close-up view shows the faint tracks on the piece of slate . Chris Jarvis, education officer at the Museum, said: ‘Footprints of this age are incredibly rare and extremely hard to spot, so we were amazed when Bruno produced them at our After-School Club. Bruno poses with a preserved horseshoe crab: The 10-year-old collected the fossil while on holiday in Cornwall last summer . 'Still more impressive is the fact that . Bruno had a hunch they might be some kind of footprints, even though the . specimen had some of our world expert geologists arguing about it over . their microscopes!' Bruno’s fossil has been confirmed by the Museum as likely showing footprints of a pair of mating horseshoe crabs laid down during the Carboniferous period, some 308-327million years ago. At this time, the sea was slowly being sealed off as the Earth’s landmasses crunched together to form Pangaea. The museum's Natural History After-School Club encourages Year 6 children to develop their interest in the natural world. It is hopes that some might become the next generation of geologists and zoologists. The club’s weekly sessions look at rocks, fossils, insects and other animal life. Members are encouraged to make observations and collect specimens to be shared each week. Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but are more closely related to spiders and scorpions than lobsters and shrimp. They are one of the world's oldest species, with the earliest fossils found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 million years ago. They live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms, but will occasionally come on shore for mating. They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer, and in recent years, habitat destruction and over-harvesting has led to a decline in numbers. Bruno was specially selected for the club by his teachers, after showing a particular interest in nature. He collected the fossil while on holiday in Cornwall last summer. ‘Unfortunately, the excitement and motivation that many children instinctively feel for studying nature is often lost during their teenage years as it is seen as 'uncool' or a bit 'weird', and science can become text-book oriented and exam-driven during secondary school,’ Mr Jarvis said. ‘The club is our attempt to encourage children to value and extend their skills and knowledge and to follow their interests. 'I hope it is helping to create a group of kids that will continue to share their interests into their teenage years and beyond.’ Bruno and his family have decided to donate the fossil specimen to the Museum’s collection.","Youngster brought shale containing prints to museum after-school club .

A trio of Bitcoin apps have soared up Spain's download charts as people in the country move their money away from banks to avoid any attempt by the government to tap them for funding. Bitcoin is a alternative currency popular online that, unlike conventional currency, has no central bank. Spaniards demonstrate against austerity measures: Figures show people in the country are increasingly turned to the Bitcoin virtual currency to hide their savings from the cash-strapped government . Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency based on an open-source, peer-to-peer internet protocol that, unlike conventional currency, has no central bank.

Users can exchange bitcoins internationally from their computers directly through a 'wallet' app or a via website without the need for intermediate financial institutions. As of March 2013, the monetary base of Bitcoin was valued at over $500million (£330million). Spain's sudden interest in Bitcoin coincided with news that the Cyprus intended to tax Cypriot savings accounts as part of the embattled country's bailout programme. Although that proposal was subsequently rejected by the Cyprus parliament, it didn't stop Spaniards from developing a sudden, almost spontaneous interest in the alternative currencies. The Bitcoin Gold app shot up the Spanish iPhone Finance category from 498 to 72, while another app called Bitcoin Ticker went up from 526 to 52 in a single day, BGR reported. The value of the currency has since soared from around £32 per bitcoin on Monday to more than £48 today. Nick Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, a technology company, told Bloomberg Businessweek that the rise was 'one hundred per cent' due to the crisis in Cyprus. 'This is an entirely predictable and rational outcome for what’s happening in Cyprus,' said Mr Colas. 'If you want to get a good sense of the stress European savers are feeling, just watch Bitcoin prices.' That savers are more willing to invest their cash in an unstable, experimental currency like Bitcoin has been seen as a seen as a sign of growing uncertainty over European banking. Bitcoin has only been in circulation since 2009, and in that time it has experienced wild fluctuations in value and occasional hacking and account thefts. The anonymous, encrypted nature of the currency has made it a favourite for black-market transactions, including online illegal drugs purchases at the Silk Road marketplace. Unrest: Cypriots protesting against plans by their government to raid their savings to plug a budget black hole. The measure was flatly rejected by the country's parliament . Bitcoin removes financial institutions entirely from transactions, which has led bank officials to fear its increasing popularity. A European Central Bank report published last year warned that increased demand for Bitcoin 'could have have a negative impact on the reputation of central banks'. 'The public may perceive the incident as being caused, in part, by a central bank not doing its job properly,' the report added presciently. However, while Bitcoin might be considered a possible bolt-hole for small savers scared that their nest eggs could be seized by cash strapped governments, the Russian billionaires also burned by the Cypriot tax levy will not to look for another safe haven. 'Bitcoin is good if you want to make a deposit of between $1,000 and $10,000,' Mr Colas said.

A bigamist who has been married four times has been spared jail after a judge heard pleas from his children describing him as an honest man. Peter Lloyd, 53, from Twyford, Berkshire, wed his Thai bride, Malee Mahamatyachit, in 2000 before divorcing his first wife and mother of his children three years later. While still married to Malee he went on to marry Lizette and his current wife Georgetta. He eventually divorced Malee in August last year. However, Judge Zoe Smith gave him a six month prison sentence suspended for 12 months when she read statements from his children. Lloyd married his first wife Karen in 1985 and the couple went on to have three children. Their relationship hit the rocks in the late nineties and Lloyd started travelling frequently to Thailand where he met Malee. It was during one of his trips to the South East Asian country that he married Malee in 2000, but he did not divorce Karen until 2003. Malee was given indefinite leave to remain in the UK but recent investigations by immigration officials going back to 2006 uncovered Lloyd's bigamy. Adrian Eissa, defending Lloyd, said: 'He was going through what might be described as a mid-life crisis. The grass was not greener on the other side of the fence. 'He suspected she was seeing someone else. The upshot was she went back to Thailand for a while. He bought her a house in Thailand and still maintained a relationship with her, albeit he then moved on to a relationship with another lady, Lizette Giogu.' Lloyd and Malee finally conceded that their relationship was over in 2008 but he did not divorce her until August 2012 and at some point during their marriage he also wed a woman called Lizette. In 2010 he married Georgetta and the couple are still together, living in a house in Twyford, Berkshire. They also support her elderly parents in Romania. When he was questioned about the bigamy allegations at Christmas 2011, he refused to answer questions. His lawyer said this was because 'he doesn't see it as all his fault', but added 'he does accept he has done wrong.' The court also heard Lloyd lost £500,000 after getting involved in a Ponzi investment scheme and had a £2,000-a-month mortgage despite earning just £240 a week. Peter Lloyd arriving at Reading Crown Court with his current wife Georgetta who he currently lives with in Twyford, Berkshire . Addressing Judge Smith, Mr Eissa said: 'Your Honour can see something of . the character of the man in what he has done since all this turmoil in . his life. 'Rather than throw his his hands up in despair at losing half-a-million . pounds through a dishonest fraudster, he has got involved in a small . company selling ceiling fans.' The court heard references from Lloyd's three children, pleading for their father not to be sent to jail.Final year student Rebekah, 22, said: 'All he ever wanted was the best . for me and my siblings and he worked hard to financially provide for us. She added: 'I would not be who I am without my father. He has taught me to be kind and honest.' Pleas from Lloyd's other children -19-year-old medical science student .

German scientists who were struggling to name all the new weevil species in Papua New Guinea reached for the phone book for 10 of their discoveries.

A man who taunted police by creating his own wanted poster and put it online has been jailed for 16 months after police finally caught up with him. Anthony Swinburn, 28, had been on the run for nine months after absconding from court while awaiting sentencing for common assault and theft. He put a mock-up wanted poster in the style of something from a western onto Facebook and he was put on the force's most wanted list. Anthony Swinburn, 28, was jailed for 16 months after taunting police online with his own 'Wanted' poster . Longford Police announced his arrest with a cheeky tweet saying his wish was their command . He boasted online about enjoying a top-of-the-range Sky TV package and his girlfriend's alleged cannabis habit. Swinburn also changed his name on Facebook to 'Bonnie Clyde' in a bid to mock police's efforts to catch him. Swinburn was one of West Midlands Police's most wanted criminals . For weeks, Swinburn bragged about his . life on the run via a string of updates on Facebook. Entries included . the snowy weather, bets on football matches and even his efforts to lose . weight. In one message he described how he was about to tuck into a steak, onion rings, chicken wings and fries. But he was back in court this week after being arrested last month - a day after he had boasted on Facebook about being wanted by police. The Twitter account for Longford Police stated after his arrest: 'Man who posted his own wanted poster online is now in custody. His wish was our command!' Swinburn, from Coventry, was at Warwick Crown Court last November waiting to be sentenced for stealing beer from Tesco when he decided to go on the run. He was subject of an eight month suspended sentence for aggravated vehicle taking and theft when he committed an offence of harassment. He pleaded not guilty to two new charges of racially aggravated common assault, but guilty to racially aggravated harassment, when back in the dock this week. The court heard Swinburn had gone into the One Stop Shop in Binley Woods in January last year, picked up a pack of cans of Strongbow cider and left without paying. When staff checked the CCTV recording they also saw Swinburn had carried out an identical theft earlier in the day, again taking a pack of Strongbow worth £14. Following his arrest, he was bailed, only to steal a pack of Budweiser from Tesco in Leamington Spa later the same month. When apprehended, he denied acting dishonesty, claiming he believed a woman with him, who also had a pack, was going to get hers scanned twice while he waited outside. Defending Swinburn, Tom Schofield described him as a 'nice lad'. Swinburn changed his name on Facebook to 'Bonnie Clyde' in a bid to mock police's efforts to catch him . He said: 'There are lots of reasons to give up and send him to prison, but although he has repeatedly fallen off the wagon, it is a wagon that is still running. 'I would ask you to pass another suspended sentence, with all the risks that carries. His problem is alcohol, but when he's not in drink, he is actually quite a nice lad.' Judge Marten Coates was not swayed by his plea and jailed Swinburn, saying: 'Your barrister asks me to give you a chance, but you appear at this court for breaching a suspended sentence on a number of occasions. 'You've had your chances and it's time to draw a line under your offences.'","Anthony Swinburn sentenced for 16 months after being tracked down .

Wendy Croxford (pictured) set up a website in her ex-husband's new, distinctive name . A bitter divorce battle has led to a regulator ruling that individuals do not have the right to protect their names in web addresses in the same way as registered companies. Wendy Croxford, 49, from Weeke, Winchester, set up a website in her ex-husband's distinctive surname after he re-married. Simon Mitchell and his new wife, Maiken Hvidbo, became Mr and Mrs Hvidbo-Mitchell, prompting Mrs Croxford to set up hvidbro-mitchell.co.uk. Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell launched a dispute with Nominet, claiming Mrs Croxford has since used the site as a forum for hate, protest and obsessive criticism of her ex-husband. Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell, from Sutton Valance, Kent, said that whenever her name is typed into Google the website comes out at the top of search results. She went to Nominet, the organisation that polices web domains in the UK, to strip Mrs Croxford, who has remarried, of the web address. However, Nominet ruled in Mrs Croxford's favour saying there is 'no free-standing right of personality' and, however unusual Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell's name may be, she cannot stop Mrs Croxford from using it. Nominet has ruled in favour of celebrities in the past because they have registered their names as trade marks. Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell argued that, even in her homeland of Denmark, only a tiny handful of people bear the name Hvidbro. The traditional name is protected under Danish law and she had been unable to find anyone in the world who used it in a hyphenated form. Mrs Croxford's 'personal, emotive and one-sided' criticisms of her ex-husband on the website were having a knock-on effect on her and had caused 'anxiety and distress' to her two children, she told Nominet expert, Andrew Clinton. She claimed the domain name had been 'deliberately selected in bad faith' and was being used by Mrs Croxford as part of a 'campaign' against her ex-husband 'to mislead members of the public and attract them to the website under false pretences'. Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell said that references to her children's school and home addresses were only removed from the website in response to a police visit to Mrs Croxford's home. Simon and Maiken Hvidbro-Mitchell had hoped Mrs Croxford would be ordered to take down the website . The name, which she has borne since 2002 and which is 'unique to her family', was 'a very significant and important part of her personal identity', she argued. But Mrs Croxford, who split from her ex-husband more than a decade ago, denied having done anything wrong and insisted the website was a legitimate means of highlighting his alleged failure to meet child maintenance and court costs orders. The domain has nothing to do with Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell and that was made clear on the website, she said. The police had taken no action against her and had not warned her or advised her to make any changes to her website. Refusing to transfer the domain name to Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell, Mr Clinton said: 'There is no free-standing general right of personality, i.e. a right by which a person with a particular name can seek to prevent the use of that name by others. 'In other words, the mere fact that someone has a particular name is not of itself sufficient to found a cause of action... the name Hvidbro-Mitchell may be very unusual but it does not belong to the complainant in the proprietary sense. 'The list of people who share that surname may be a very short list, in reality it is probably only her immediate family, but that does not justify the leap in reasoning to the conclusion that it is her unique name over which she has rights. 'It is abundantly clear on the evidence that the target of Mrs Croxford's wrath was not, in fact, the complainant at all; it was her husband, who shares the same surname. 'I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell has rights in a name which is identical or similar to the domain name'. Mrs Hvidbro-Mitchell's case having fallen at the first hurdle, Mr Clinton said it was unnecessary for him to decide whether the domain name was an 'abusive registration' in Mrs Croxford's hands. In reaching its decision, Nominet looked at previous cases over the issue of rights in personal names that have been registered as trade marks. They include the following: . laurenluke.co.ukA make-up tutor and supplier using her own name to trade. She built up a reputation with her business and it was therefore deemed appropriate that she had trademark rights to her name. bjornborg.co.ukTwo complaints were received including one that pointed out that a number of registered trademarks use the name Björn Borg. fayed.co.ukLawyers acting for Mohamed Al Fayed contacted Nominet after the domain was registered by a man called Chris Holland. When they contacted Mr Holland directly he responded saying: 'Thank you for your email and letter regarding the domain name fayed.co.uk. 'Although we would have loved to have been able to simply donate this domain to your truly dreadful and odious client I regret to inform you that we have recently sold this domain.' Attempts were made to contact a Mr Fayed, but Nominet was not convinced he existed and ruled that 'the trademarks and the ""alfayed"" domain names are held by Harrods'.","Wendy Croxford set up a website to vent her fury at her ex-husband using his name in the web address .

The dog walker initially thought they had found a human organ in the container, which police believe was partially buried before being unearthed by an animal. Horrifying discovery: The dog walker found the buried tub of placenta on a footpath near Tooting Bec Athletics Track . Medical staff who examined photographs of the substance have suggested it is human placenta which could be two weeks old. The item has been taken for pathological examination. A search using specially trained police 'blood' dogs did not find any other items buried in the area, the Met added. Police said the early indication of human placenta has raised concerns there may be a vulnerable new mother who has given birth and may require medical assistance. Chief Inspector Nick Aldworth said: 'Obviously we are at the very early stages of the investigation into what has been found, but the suggestion that it could be a human placenta does give us concern that there could be an individual whose health and wellbeing may be at risk.' 'That said, we retain an open mind regarding the item and how it came to be buried on the pathway pending the results of testing and any confirmed information coming to light. Alarming: Medical staff have suggested the human placenta the dog found could be two weeks old . 'Therefore we are appealing to the person who buried the item to contact us, or anyone who knows the person who buried the item. Your call will be treated in the strictest of confidence. 'We are also appealing to anyone who uses the path at the back of Tooting Bec Athletics Track to contact us if they remember seeing anything out of the ordinary there recently. 'I would like to emphasise that our primary concern at the moment is for the welfare of anybody who may have given birth without medical assistance and our focus is currently on welfare and not enforcement. Anybody who comes forward will be treated with this in mind.' Anyone who can assist police is asked to call on 101.","Dog walker found placenta near Tooting Bec Athletics Track in south London .

Sexual motivation: After nurse Simon Goad tried to coax a seven-year old girl into his car, police found thousands of indecent images of children in his home . A nurse has been jailed for four years after he attempted to abduct a seven-year-old girl while she was out riding her bike. Senior nurse Simon Goad, 46, tried to entice the girl into his car near her house in Doncaster, South Yorkshire last September. He approached her saying: 'You look a bit wet, get in my car and I’ll take you home’. The terrified girl ran home to tell her mother, who looked outside to spot Goad loitering in an alleyway next to their house. She took photographs of him to give to police, which meant they were able to track him down straight away. Sarah Wright, prosecuting at Sheffield Crown Court, said there was ‘sexual motivation’ in his attempt to abduct his young victim. When Goad, a nurse at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, was arrested by police officers found more than 8,000 indecent images of children on his computers. They also found a video of him abusing children online. He had filmed himself asking three Asian girls, aged about five, seven and 12, to strip via a webcam while he performed a sex act. When police checked Goad’s computers they found indecent images of children, some as young as four and involved in sexual activity. When arrested Goad claimed to have been near the girl's house ‘looking for scrap metal’ and it was a coincidence he happened to walk down the same alleyway as the seven-year old. Gul Nawaz Hussain, who defended Goad, said: 'Mercifully, the young girl does not suffer any long-term impact. I understand she is stoic and has made a full recovery. Disturbing: The judge at Sheffield Crown Court heard how Goad had pursued the girl back to her home where her mother saw him loitering outside . 'Goad is truly remorseful and full of shame. He had good employment and a stable family life, all of which he has thrown away.' Sentencing, Judge Paul Watson told the nurse: 'There is another side to your character, a much darker side, which manifested itself last September when you attempted to abduct this little girl. The judge said the images on Goad's computers were 'particularly disturbing.' 'There was a particularly vile clip of your interaction with young girls you were abusing over the internet for your gratification.' Professor Hilary Chapman, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust chief nurse, said: 'As soon as we were made aware of the allegations surrounding Mr Goad we immediately suspended him.' 'He resigned from his job as soon as he was charged.' His role did not involve working with children and when we were made aware of the charges he was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Indians by Michigan State University and University of California has revealed that preferential treatment for men starts before they are even born. Women expecting boys were more . likely to get prenatal medical appointments, take iron supplements, . and receive vital tetanus shots. Discrimination: Expectant mothers carrying girls are less likely to give birth in hospital, take iron supplements and receive tetanus immunisation . They were also more likely to deliver a son in a health-care facility, as opposed to at home. It is even still common practice to have an abortion based on the baby's sex in India, though it is illegal. When baby girls are carried to full term, they still face medical discrimination with serious long-term health consequences. Assistant professor Leah Lakdawala from MSU who carried out the research said: 'This type of discrimination, while not as severe as sex-selective abortion, is very important . for children's well-being' 'It paints a pretty dire picture of what's happening.' Missing out on the Tetanus vaccinations is a particular worry as it is the main cause of newborn deaths in India. Babies whose mothers had not received a tetanus vaccination were more likely to be born underweight or die shortly after birth. Head start: Boys get preferential treatment before they are even born in many male-dominated societies . The researchers compared the survey to other patriarchal nations such as China, Bangladesh and Pakistan and saw similar evidence of medical discrimination. This could mean that girls are already at a serious disadvantage when they are born. 'We know that children born at higher birth weights go to school for longer periods and have higher wages as adults, so the future implications here are serious,' Lakdawala said. The study was published in the Journal of Human Resources.","Mothers of boys more likely to get tetanus shots and prenatal appointments .

A little boy born without shinbones, knees or ankles is finally able to own his first pair of shoes after being fitted with special prosthetic legs with feet. Three-year-old Ted Johnson's new legs have feet - unlike his last few pairs. This week, he tried out his new blue fibreglass prosthetic legs for the first time on the basketball court at the Royal Children's Hospital, in Melbourne, Australia. Up and about: Three-year-old Ted Johnson tries out his new prosthetic legs with feet . He was born with without shinbones, knees or ankles due to a rare condition called tibial hemimelia . Scans while his mother Abbie was pregnant failed to reveal that Ted was suffering from the rare condition tibial hemimelia. This is . where there the tibia - the shinbone - is either partially or totally . missing at birth. The foot may also be deformed or may have additional . toes. Ted's condition . meant his parents, Abbie and Peter, were forced to take the agonising . decision to have his legs amputated when he was a year old. The youngster has previously been fitted with two other types of prosthetics, but this is the first set with actual feet. And . as soon as the new blue fibreglass legs were strapped on with Velcro, . he was on the move. His mother said: 'He's incredible - nothing stops . him. Rare: The condition means the tibia - the shinbone - is either partially or totally missing at birth . Now he has feet, Ted will be able to choose his first pair of shoes . 'We thought he might need a . frame to get around at first, so I can't believe how well he's doing. We're going shoe shopping tomorrow for the first time.' Prosthetist . Jim Lavranos, who made and adjusted each of Ted's three sets of legs, . said it usually took children up to three or four years to move through . the progressions of leg extensions. 'He's getting these much earlier than we'd normally do it, just because he's so confident and quick.He'll fly through these.' Most . legs affected by tibial hemimelia will look 'unusual'.

Hell hath no fury: Faye Hill sposted a flaming card through her boyfriend's letterbox after a row, causing £35,000 worth of damage . A mother-of-two posted a burning birthday card through her boyfriend's front door following an argument, setting his front door on fire. Faye Hill, 28, posted the flaming card through Graham Dunn's letterbox to 'mark her annoyance in a symbolic manner' but caused £35,000 worth of damage, a court heard today. The card caused Dunn's front door to burst into flames, setting off the fire alarm as smoke billowed through the 36-year-old's property. Hill was handed a two-year suspended sentence after she pleaded guilty to arson at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. The court heard how Hill had 'argued throughout the evening' with her boyfriend before deciding to set the card on fire. After being alerted to the fire, Dunn frantically fought the blaze with the help of a neighbour before firefighters arrived at the house in Stoke-on-Trent on May 12 last year. Hill was also ordered to undergo up to 60 anger management and alcohol awareness sessions and told to pay £3,000 in compensation. Judge David Fletcher told her: 'You made the very foolish and extremely dangerous decision to put a lit greeting card through the door to the property Mr Dunn was residing in. 'You walked away, you did not call the emergency services.' Lawyer Jason Holt, defending Hill, said the relationship with Mr Dunn was 'on-off' and they had argued throughout the evening but that she had not intended to start a fire. He said: 'It was clear to her at the time of posting the card, not only was Mr Dunn awake, but probably in the vicinity of where it landed.' 'She was aware there was a concrete floor, it is not a case where there was a fitted carpet behind the door. 'She is at a low risk of re-offending, there is nothing to suggest she is a danger to anyone.' No one in the house was injured.","Faye Hill, 28, put the card through Graham Dunn's letterbox following row .

Sitting on the sidewalk with his head bowed, drunk driver Mark Mullan can't bear to look back at the two covered bodies lying on the Seattle road - whose deaths he was allegedly responsible for. Led away in tears from the scene, Mullan, who has five prior DUI arrests and a suspended license, plowed into doting grandparents Dennis and Judith Schulte while they were out for a walk on Monday morning with their daughter-in-law and their 10-day-old grandson. The much-loved teachers had moved recently from Indiana to the West Coast and were pronounced dead at the scene, while pediatric nurse Karina and son, Elias Ulkiksen-Schulte are currently in a critical condition at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Scroll Down to Watch Video . Realization: Mark Mullan, 50 sits on the sidewalk after killing two pedestrians and critically injuring two others _ a woman and a 10-day-old infant - in Seattle, Washington . Dennis and Judith Schulte were killed when a suspected drunk driver collided with them on a notorious blind spot on a Seattle road . Mullan is being held on investigation of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault. Prosecutors have until Thursday to formally charge him. A police officer said in court documents that he smelled alcohol on Mullan's breath and that Mullan showed impairment on sobriety tests. A preliminary test showed a breath alcohol level of 0.22, nearly three times the legal limit of 0.08, the officer said. His license was suspended at the time of the crash at an intersection in a residential neighborhood, according to the documents. 'He does not have a valid license,' said Brad Benfield, a spokesman with the Department of Licensing. He also did not have an ignition interlock deivce installed on his Chevrolet pick-up, which an earlier court ruling ordered him to have installed. 'They were so elated. This is their only grandchild,' said Judith Schulte's sister, Susan Morton.

He just hit all four of them,' said Morton, of Cottonwood, Minn., in a telephone interview. Mullan told police he was unable to see the pedestrians because the sun was in his eyes, according to court documents. His license was suspended at the time of the crash, according to the documents. 'He does not have a valid license,' said Brad Benfield, a spokesman with the Department of Licensing. It was unclear Tuesday whether Mullan had legal representation. A message left with an attorney who represented him in a drunken driving case in December was not immediately returned Tuesday. Mullan didn't answer reporters' questions as police led him away from the scene of the crash in handcuffs Monday. Police said he stopped after the crash and was cooperative. A phone number listed for Mullan was disconnected. The Schulte's had just moved from Indiana to be near their new-born grandchild who was delivered just two weeks ago . Mullan has a history of driving drunk. His most recent arrest for drunken driving was on Christmas Day when he struck a Seattle motel and was found to have a blood-alcohol content four times the legal limit. Prior to the Christmas Day arrest, Mullan was arrested four other times related to driving under the influence. In October of 2012, Mullan was arrested by Washington State Patrol in his black Chevrolet pickup, after speeding on the Alderwood Mall Parkway. His blood-alcohol level was measured at .14 percent. His Christmas Day arrest came after he drove into The Seals Motel in Seattle on two separate occasions on the same evening. Police wrote that he was so intoxicated he could not get out of his truck without help. He also provided police with a false name - his twin brothers' - something that he has done at least once before according to police documents. On that occasion his blood alcohol level measured .32 percent, which is more than four times the legal limit. Police believed that he was so drunk that they called paramedics and sent him to Harborview Medical Center. The victims were crossing 33rd Avenue Northeast at Northeast 75th Street in Seattle, with Ulriksen-Schulte carrying her son, when the pickup struck them . At the time of his accident his license was suspended due to the five prior occasions he had been in trouble with the law. Morton said Karina Schulte, who is from Chile, works as a pediatric nurse specialist and is dedicated to her work. Dennis and Judith Schulte were both longtime high school teachers; she taught English and was a head guidance counselor at Northwestern High School for years, while he taught math and coached at Western High School. 'People like her don't come around very often,' said Northwestern High School Principal Al Remaly. 'She was just all about the kids and all about anything she could do for them.' Judy's brother, J. Hugh Dwyer, said his sister and her husband made a big impact in their community. 'Between the two of them, they probably positively influenced thousands of high school students,' he said. They had moved to Seattle from Kokomo in February to witness the birth of their first grandson. They had planned to spend six months in Seattle to be near their son and his family. They were renting an apartment near the intersection where they were killed. 'They were so elated. This is their only grandchild,' Morton said. 'They wanted to be there when he was born. They got to hold him and be there with him for 10 days.' Judy Schulte was a dedicated volunteer at Kokomo Urban Outreach , said DeAnna Ancil, who directs the group's food pantry operations. Ancil said Judy Schulte 'beamed' about having a grandchild. Friends and relatives say the couple had begun planning a move to Seattle when they learned Ulriksen-Schulte was expecting their first grandchild . 'That's the positive thing, that they were able to see the grandchild and enjoy him for two weeks and enjoy the family connection,' Ancil said. 'But (it's) just such a shock still for all of us.' Retired teachers Judy and Dennis Schulte had devoted their lives to helping children. 'That was their thing, and they were very good at it,' said Reverand Ronald Mann, pastor of Russiaville United Methodist Church near Kokomo, to the Seattle Times. 'They were wonderful people who will be greatly missed. 'They were both very active in the life of our church,' said Mann, who noted Judy Schulte was in charge of the children’s ministry and gave sermons to children. Ulriksen-Schulte, who suffered a crushed pelvis and cranial bleeding, and Elias, whose injuries were not disclosed, were in critical condition Tuesday at Harborview Medical Center. The Schultes celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary in June 2011. Judy Schulte worked as a guidance counselor and teacher at Indiana's Northwestern Schools and colleague Ryan Snoddy said that even after her retirement in 2008, she still would return to help. 'She was a great lady who inspired a lot of kids,' he said. 'Judy and Dennis were doing what they loved, which is spending time with their family. To have this kind of tragedy just really takes the breath out of you.'","Dennis and Judith Schulte were hit and killed by drunk driver Mark Mullan on Monday .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 05:52 EST, 26 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:17 EST, 26 March 2013 . A mother-of-three whose crippling back ache left her bedridden has finally been given a new lease of life - thanks to a remote control. Lorraine Brooks suffered agonising back pain for almost 30 years and was left barely able to walk. But after being given a remote control, which is used to block pain signals to the brain, Lorraine can live her life free from agony for the first time in years. Mrs Brooks, from from Southport, Merseyside, has been fitted with a spinal cord stimulator - where electrodes are implanted into her spine, along with a battery pack, which is controlled with the remote and recharged through the skin. She can now use the remote to control how much pain relief she receives. Cured: Lorraine Brooks suffered from crippling back ache for 30 years before she was given a new remote-controlled device to relieve her pain . Pioneering: An X-ray of the spinal cord stimulator that has cured her back pain. Electrodes are inserted into the body and the strength of pain relief they provide is determined by the remote control . She said: 'Before I had the remote the back pain was almost unbearable. I could hardly walk and I don't think I had a full night's sleep in about eight years. 'It's was like toothache in your back all day. I had to live on pain killers and I woke up crying every day. Mrs Brooks has been fitted with a spinal cord stimulator, which involves having electrodes implanted in the spine. These are powered by a battery pack that is also implanted and recharged through the skin. The electrodes prevent pain signals from reaching the brain by interrupting them. The level of pain relief the electrodes deliver - depending on how bad the pain is that day - is determined by the remote control. 'It was soul destroying and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, so when it was suggested that I try the remote I jumped at the chance. 'If my back is hurting more one day, I can just turn up the device with the control, and if it's not as bad I turn it down. If I'm doing something that takes a lot of energy, like going to the gym, I'll turn myself up. ""I'm very protective of the remote - I don't take it out of the house and I always know where it is, I never let it get lost. 'It's actually a cutting-edge neurostimulation system - but it's as easy to use as turning on the telly.'After years of agony I couldn't be happier - I've got my life back.' Mrs Brooks first suffered back ache when she was just 15 years old due to a slip in the spine. She underwent surgery which fused the bottom two vertebra in her spine together, but was devastated to find in December 2004 that the fuse had worn away. 'I started suffering back pain again but I was convinced it wouldn't be anything major. I never knew it was going to be the start of such much agony. 'I . was in constant pain. I couldn't sit or stand in any way that would . make me feel better, and walking or standing for long periods of time . was totally out of the question. Before having surgery, Mrs Brooks underwent a trial of the spinal cord stimulator which significantly reduced her pain . Happy: Having had surgery, and being given to remote control to black pain signals to the brain, she can live pain-free for the first time in years . The 43-year-old had hoped that surgery in January 2006, which involved placing a titanium cage filled with bone at the bottom of her spine, would have been the answer to all her problems.However, once again no relief came. 'I thought I would wake up for the operation and be pain free but it was like nothing had changed.' From then on, she attended a pain clinic at Ormskirk Hospital where she was put on various different pain relief medication. 'I tried everything - I had Botox, patches which acted like local anaesthetic, acupuncture, steroid injections - it was never ending. 'I was in a constant battle against myself and I became a recluse. I couldn't go on holiday with my family or go shopping with my daughter. I was always fighting.' It wasn't until five years later, when Lorraine was referred to the Walton Centre in Liverpool in 2011, that she finally saw an answer to her prayers. 'When I was referred to the Walton Centre they diagnosed me with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome. 'As soon as I got a diagnosis, it opened doors to even more types of pain relief - one of which was the spinal cord stimulator. Active: The device also means she is no longer bedridden with pain and can go out and about with daughter Amy and son Will . 'I'd read about it online but I never thought I'd be eligible. But after I was assessed by the team at the centre, and they told me that I was a candidate for it, I was over the moon.' Mrs Brooks said: 'I was given the stimulator for a two-week trial in March 2012. They insert electrodes in your back and a battery is strapped around you which you have to charge up. Then I have the remote to control the amount of pain relief I receive. 'As soon as the device was fitted I felt like a different person. I had to keep a pain dairy and score my pain out of ten - before the trial my pain was a ten at least, but with the stimulator it was down to a 2 or 3. Transformed: Mrs Brooks says the surgery has totally changed her life . 'As soon as I knew it was working I told the doctors they'd have to fight me to give it back. 'Luckily the trial was such a success that they told me I could receive a permanent one which was implanted in May. 'They turned the device on in the theatre, and since then I've never switched it off.' The remote control has three different programmes - each with a low, medium and high setting - which she can vary depending on how bad her pain is that day. The device also includes a battery pack which is implanted inside Lorraine, which she recharges every day. 'I recharge my batteries while I watch TV in the evening. It's all really easy.' Since Lorraine received the transplant, her life has been totally transformed. 'I went from staying in bed all day, to going for a full afternoon's shopping with my daughter.  After years and years of suffering I can finally live my life. 'If someone had told me this years ago I wouldn't have believed them. I'm so lucky to be where I am today. I can't quite believe it.' Dr Manohar Sharma, her doctor at the Walton Centre, said: 'Lorraine had severe back and leg pain which was not helped with spinal fusion. Her pain has been intractable and longstanding, having had trials of various treatments, including injections. 'She is the first patient treated with high frequency spinal stimulation at The Walton Centre and I am delighted the way her pain has responded to this treatment. 'She has improvement in her function and quality of life, this is great news for patients like her who may be suffering with similar conditions.'","Lorraine Brooks, 43, could barely walk due to the agonising pain .

A woman is lucky to be alive after her horse kicked her in the head on two separate occasions, crushing her skull twice. Claire Hope, 39, lost her eye after her two-year-old horse Archie threw his hoof into the side of her face - smashing her eye socket and cheek bone into six pieces, and causing a brain haemorrhage. Surgeons told her that her horrendous injuries were similar to those suffered by a bomb blast victim - and had no choice but to remove what remained of her right eye. Despite her terrible ordeal, Mrs Hope, from Thirsk, north Yorkshire, was determined not to give up on her horses. Claire Hope (with horses Ollie and Costa) is lucky to be alive after her skull was crushed twice by her horses . First, she lost her eye after her two-year-old horse Archie threw his hoof into the side of her face - smashing her eye socket and cheek bone into six pieces, and causing a brain haemorrhage . But just two years after her accident, she was kicked in the head again - shattering her other eye socket, and breaking the top part of her arm in half. Ten months on from her second brush with death, doctors have still been unable to fix her broken arm - but she is still determined to follow her dream of becoming a para dressage champion. Mrs Hope, who works in transport hire, said: 'To be kicked in the head by a horse once is incredibly unlucky - but twice is unbelievable. 'I've lost my eye and had to adjust to a whole new way of life, learning to do the most mundane tasks with limited vision. 'It's really hard to deal with becoming monocular later in life, as I have had to re-educate my brain. 'I couldn't believe it when I was kicked for a second time - my skull had only just really repaired itself from the first accident. 'My arm is so badly broken that surgeons are struggling to find a way to mend it. It's been broken in two places since May last year, and it just will not heal naturally.' Mrs Hope has also suffered chronic osteomyilitus (an infection of the bones) and is currently receiving treatment for a suspected deep vein thrombosis. She has also lost feeling in my ring and little finger and very little movement in her fingers. She said: 'I don't blame my horses for what happened - they weren't trying to hurt me, and my injuries are something I just have to accept. 'It has made me determined to follow my dreams and to compete in and promote para sports and encourage others to give riding a try, for someone who cannot move I can't imagine the freedom and feeling of movement this would give.' Two years later she was kicked in the head again, shattering her other eye socket, and breaking the top part of her arm in half . Ten months on from her second brush with death, doctors have still been unable to fix her broken arm . Her first accident happened as she mucked out her two-year-old gelding in December 2009. She said: 'I had given Archie a toy to play with in his stable. He was very excited by it, and was bucking waiting to get out. 'I went into the stable to get him and suddenly - bam! - his foot connected with my head. 'My body seemed to go onto autopilot. I didn't realise how badly hurt I was and I carried on working, before realising that I needed to call an ambulance. 'I don't remember much else apart from my mum and my husband shouting at me to stay awake.'If they hadn't kept me conscious, I doubt I'd be here today. ""When I finally came round, I was told that my eye was squashed like a grape on the floor. Doctors thought that my other eye might lose vision if my bad eye wasn't removed, so I agreed to have it taken out. 'I felt like a lamb to the slaughter when I walked into that operating theatre. 'The thought of losing my eye was terrifying. But I refused to allow myself to sit and dwell on what I'd lost. I had to just get on with it. She has also suffered a chronic bone infection and has very little movement in her fingers . Determined: Despite her ordeal, Claire is still determined to follow her dream of becoming a para dressage champion . 'I was desperate to get back and look after my horses, but I had to stay away for a month because of the risk of infection. 'I had to teach myself how to live again. Even the simplest tasks were a nightmare with only one eye, as I'd lost my sense of depth. It was so difficult to drive my car, or peg the washing out on the line - I'd constantly be reaching for things and they'd be nowhere near where I perceived them to be. 'Eight weeks after the accident, I was determined to get back on my horses, and although I was terrified, I managed to do it. 'Sadly, I had to sell Archie, as I couldn't risk being injured again as I broke him in to be ridden, but I keep in touch with his new owner.' But as Mrs Hope started to get back on track, disaster struck again - after she was caught in the cross fire after her two other horses, Ollie and Costa, struck out in a field. She was again rushed to the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, where doctors battled to save her. She said: 'I'd gone to feed the horses out in their field, and luckily, my husband Tony came with me.'I gave them separate feed bowls, but they started scrapping, and before I knew what had happened, I was struck again. 'I think that if I'd had 100 per cent vision, I might have seen what was happening quickly enough to get out of the way, but it happened before I even realised it. 'Again, I suffered serious facial injuries and my left humerus was snapped in half. 'I had pins and plates inserted into my arm in a bid to fuse the bones back together, but 10 months on, after chronic osteomyilitus it's still broken and supported with a plastic brace resembling a floppy sausage. She is hoping that an operation next month will finally sort the problem. Mrs Hope added: 'Hopefully I'll be able to get back on a horse soon, and start some para dressage to music. 'My dream is to be good enough to compete at Tokyo 2020, although I may have to win the lottery, as to ride at this level you need a talented horse and loads of training. 'Funding and sponsorship are limited when you become disabled later in life and seems to apply to the under 25's, but maybe I'll get lucky given everything that's happened. 'I don't know where I get my motivation and drive but simply can't imagine life without a horse and am not prepared to settle for this option. 'I can't thank my family and friends enough for all the help and support they have given me - and the Mark Davies Injured Riders Fund, which has given me support and advice. 'I want to give people that have had a disabling injury hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.'","Claire Hope, 39, lost her eye after her horse kicked her in the side of her face .

Callum Holmes was just six months old when his right eye began to look shiny, due to a tumour called a retinoblastoma. His mother Erin, 33, caught a glance of it when he turned his head at an angle, unaware that she was looking at a potentially lethal disease. Deadly: Callum Holmes was just six months old when his right eye began to glow, due to rare cancer called retinoblastoma . Glowing: His mother Erin caught a glance of the tumour when he turned his head at an angle, unaware that she was looking at a potentially lethal disease . Ordeal: Callum's cancer was so advanced that the only treatment available was to have his whole eye removed, to ensure the disease didn't spread any further . She said: 'It was like a cat's eyes that you see on the road. You would look at him and see it, and then look again and it wasn't there. 'Only I noticed it to begin with and then others began to pick up on it. We thought it was just light reflecting in his eye. 'People sometimes pick it up on photograph as the person appears to have a white eye, rather than a red eye that you might otherwise see.' But after being referred to a specialist eye clinic, doctors confirmed Callum was suffering from retinoblastoma, a type of eye cancer that affects just 40-50 children each year in the UK. The disease generally develops in children under the age of five, however some are born with it. It develops in the cells of the retina, the light-sensitive lining of the eye. Symptoms of retinoblastoma can include an abnormal appearance of the pupil, which tends to reflect light as a white reflex. Surgery: Callum aged 11 months, covering from the operation to remove his eye at Birmingham Children's Hospital . Rare: Retinoblastoma, the type of cancer that Callum (pictured here with mother Erin) was suffering from, affects just 40-50 children each year in the UK . Replacement: After losing his right eye, Callum (with father Dan) was fitted with an artificial one . Some children have a squint, however . less common signs are a deterioration of vision, a red and irritated . pupil without infection or a change to the colour of one iris. 'I sobbed my heart out when they told us,' said Mrs Holmes. 'They said we were very lucky to spot it.' The only treatment available at this stage of development for Callum was to have his whole eye removed to ensure the cancer didn't spread any further. The youngster, from Leeds, underwent the operation at Birmingham Children's Hospital when he was just 11-months old. His father Daniel, 34, said: 'It seemed harsh and it was tough making the decision to take out our son's eye but we had to be blunt about it. 'They had to put him under and remove the eye, but it meant the cancer would be totally gone.' While retinoblastoma is easily treated if caught early, failing to remove the eye in time can cause it to spread down the optic nerve. Callum will be given replacement artificial eyes as he gets older and his eye socket expands . Hope: Callum's mother Erin is now trying to raise awareness of the rare condition . 'Callum had a category D tumour so it was very big,' said his mother, a PE teacher. 'They only go up to category E so we knew it was something we just had to do. 'They fitted Callum with an artificial eye so that the nerve endings can be attached to it. It's a small porous ball which a shell is fitted on top of, like a big contact lens.' As Callum's cancer was retained within his eye, he didn't have to undergo any follow-up treatment such as chemotherapy. He will be given replacement artificial eyes as he gets older and his eye socket expands. Mrs Holmes said: 'It's amazing how they can make bespoke eyes for your child. If felt like I had got my son back seeing him with two eyes again, it was all a very surreal experience. Awareness: The family now wants other parents to check their children's eyes . 'The artificial eyes are very realistic and they will make as many as we want until we find one that looks as good as possible for Callum.' She is now using her experiences with Callum to help raise support for the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT), a charity dedicated to supporting families affected by retinoblastoma. 'I just want other parents to go and get their children's eyes checked and make the disease more widely known,' she said. Callum's father Dan, a finance director, added: 'If Erin hadn't spotted his eyes . shining, it could have been a very different outcome. We feel so lucky . that everything has worked out so well.'","Callum Holmes was six months old when his right eye began to look shiny .

Andy Reed, 26, was looking forward to spending the rest of his life with his new wife Claire until her tragic death at a friend's hen party . The heartbroken husband of a 22-year-old 'perfect bride' killed by a rare heart condition five months after their wedding has spoken of his grief. Andy Reed, 26, was looking forward to spending the rest of his life with his new wife Claire until her tragic death at a friend's hen party. Mrs Reed, an accountant, collapsed and died after getting out of a swimming pool and jacuzzi at the celebration at a country mansion. Mrs Reed's best friend and paramedics desperately fought to resuscitate her, but she died in hospital from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS). Grief stricken Mr Reed, who only married the former head girl at a fairytale ceremony in October, is issuing an urgent plea to raise awareness of the condition. An estimated 12 people under 35 die from a previously undiagnosed heart condition each week. Mr Reed said: 'Since Claire died I have been hit by a tsunami of emotion. 'It is just so shocking that she has gone because there were no warning signs. 'She was so bubbly and full of life and so healthy that I can't believe it has happened. Mrs Reed, an accountant, collapsed and died after getting out of a swimming pool and jacuzzi at the celebration at a country mansion . Claire and Andy Reed are pictured on their wedding day with Claire's parents, Anne and Graham Hunter, and Claire's brother, Peter . 'It makes it so much harder for me because we were only married for five months. 'Our . wedding day could not have been more perfect. It had been raining every . day up until the wedding day, and then the sun came out. 'Claire looked stunning when she came down the aisle, and I cried and cried. It was the best day of our lives. 'I am desperate for the Government and the NHS to make people more aware of what killed my perfect bride, and offer screening for it.' Mrs Reed, who had recently set up her own beauty therapy business, regularly went to the gym and was a keen kickboxer. Mr Reed is now trying to raise awareness of undiagnosed heart conditions . But months after their honeymoon in Dubai and Mauritius, Mr Reed is in mourning and planning his wife's funeral. She is reported to have 'felt sick' at the bash with 15 friends at the hen party in Taunton, Somerset. Friends took her outside to get some fresh air and she collapsed. Mrs Reed's grieving father Graham Hunter, 59, mother Anne, 59, and brother Pete, 26, are arranging for blood relatives to be screened for SADS. The charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) runs 12,000 screening tests a year for a previously undiagnosed heart condition. Of these, one in 300 young people tested are found to have a potentially life threatening condition. Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba is among the survivors of the condition, also referred to as Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome. Mr Hunter, a retired IT worker from Botley, Hants, said: 'We must not let Claire's death be in vain. 'This condition needs to be analysed and there needs to be more awareness.' The couple, from Eastleigh, Hants, met nearly five years ago and Mr Reed proposed in Cannes during a European cruise. Mourners at Mrs Reed's funeral, on Monday, have been asked to dress in her favourite colour, pink. For more information, visit: http://www.c-r-y.org.uk/ . Sudden adult death syndrome (SADS) is caused by a 'ventricular arrhythmia', a disturbance in the heart's rhythm. It can strike at any age and can even affect those who are fit and athletic. Sometimes there are no warning signs, but in other cases victims can experience dizziness or fainting spells. It is often triggered by physical or emotional stress. In some cases it may be caused by an underlying genetic disorder which runs in families, while in others it may be caused by a condition which is acquired. Around one in four cases is thought to be caused by a set of conditions called ion channelopathies. These affect the electrical functioning of the heart without affecting its structure, meaning they can only be detected in life rather than after death. The prevalence of SADS is not fully known as many sudden deaths are put down to accidents, but research suggests it claims around 500 lives a year in the UK.","Claire Read collapsed at a hen party five months after her wedding .

Under the schemes, private firms paid for the building of new hospitals, with  trusts repaying them over 30 or more years, with interest. But due to the nature of the deals, the ultimate total cost is often far more than the value of the assets. But the Treasury told the Financial Times that it had 'not planned to withdraw PFI schemes . already in the pipeline'.","The new hospital will offer every patient views of green space or parkland .

A diet-obsessed diabetic who stopped taking her insulin to lose weight has suffered tragic consequences after having to terminate her pregnancy - or risk death. Jeorgia Wood, 30, spent her teenage years and twenties dieting while battling diabetes because of her obsession to be thin. Like a growing number of young women with diabetes, she skipped vital insulin injections because they caused her to gain weight - a condition called diabulemia. But she is now suffering a number of serious health problems as a result.  As well as potentially destroying her chances of being a mother, she now faces going blind, losing a limb and undergoing a pancreas transplant. Diabetic Jeorgia Wood, 30, withheld her insulin injections for years to avoid weight gain. She is now battling several serious health problems as a result . Dangerous: As well as potentially destroying her chances of being a mother, she now faces going blind, losing a limb and undergoing a pancreas transplant. Pictured here having laser surgery to try and preserve her sight . Jeorgia, a reiki practitioner from Odiham, Hampshire, said: 'I would much rather be fat and have a baby than be skinny, blind and childless. If I could go back to being 16, I'd tell myself that being thin isn't important. 'I've realised the hard way that being thin is just not worth it.' Jeorgia and her fiance Ross Fowler, 28, were told the devastating news that she would have to terminate her pregnancy at 10 weeks last November. Her battered body had reacted so negatively to being pregnant, she developed a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum, or unrelenting morning sickness. Causing her to be sick every 10 to 30 minutes, doctors said she wouldn't survive the pregnancy, nor would her baby. They added that her diabulimia was to blame. The condition describes the process of insulin-dependent diabetics skipping injections to make themselves thinner. It is usually linked to type 1 diabetes, where the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, rather than type 2 diabetes, which is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. Insulin is a hormone that promotes fat storage, so avoiding taking it, or manipulating doses, can lead to weight loss. Jeorgia, pictured on her 12th birthday, shortly after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.  As she began using insulin, she gained four stone in weight and began to worry about her diet . Worried: By the time she was 17, she was a size 18 and 5ft 6in. She started skipping insulin injections to lose weight . The condition means Jeorgia may never be able to have a baby, but the couple have not completely ruled it out. She said: 'It was incredibly distressing for us both. It's a risk and my doctors don't know for sure if I can carry a baby.' Jeorgia, . who was always a plump child, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, also . known as juvenile onset diabetes, when she was 11 after she started . losing weight, developed a raging thirst and suffered constant fatigue. She . was told she would have to monitor everything she ate and regularly . check her blood sugar levels and needed to inject insulin four to five . times a day to mop up excess sugar from her bloodstream. Diabulemia is not yet officially recognised as a medical condition but it is predicted that it affects as many as one third of young female diabetics. It occurs when insulin-dependent type 1 diabetics skip insulin injections as a way of losing weight. Insulin is a hormone that promotes fat storage, so avoiding taking it, or manipulating doses, can lead to weight loss. It can cause blood sugar levels to surge causing fatigue, dehydration and the wearing of muscle tissue. In the longer term, the symptoms are the same as for poorly managed diabetes and include kidney disease and sight problems. Her diet was controlled as a child by her parents Charlotte, 63, and Peter, 68. But when her weight ballooned and she gained four stone on insulin, she started to skip her injections and began to obsess over every morsel of food. She also wouldn't eat in front of anyone. She said: 'From the age of about 13, I felt very unattractive. I hated the way I looked. I hated being different. If I dropped out of PE my classmates would say I was using it as an excuse, but I'd have done anything to be normal. 'By the time I was 17, I was a size 18 and 5ft 6in. If someone walked past me while I was eating a sandwich I would throw it in the nearest bin and pretend I was done with it. I thought people would judge me for my size. 'I started skipping my injections, losing weight very quickly, sometimes half a stone in a few days.' Jeorgia shrunk to a size 10-12 and started to enjoy her new slimmer frame and relished on the compliments people would give her. But cutting her insulin injections down to one a day left her constantly teetering on the brink of collapse. She . had to drink copious amounts of water to combat her unquenchable thirst . while trying to hide her problems from her family and friends. Then, . when she was 18, she collapsed on a night out with friends and was . rushed to hospital, where she was diagnosed with ketoacidosis, a . condition where the body's insulin levels are too low to convert blood . glucose into energy. Left untreated, it can cause a coma and even death. Stark implications: Even aged 25 (left), Jeorgia was still restricting her insulin injections. The damage she has caused herself meant she had to have part of her foot amputated last year (right) But even then, she did not stop obsessing and instead was even more careful to hide her diabulimia from doctors. 'No . one noticed what I was doing for ages,' she said. 'I was missing three . or four injections a day and just doing one before bed to tide me over. 'I . felt like I had flu every day of the week. But the more compliments I . got the more paranoid I became about putting the weight back on.' By the time she was 20, having noticed her monthly blood sugar tests were extremely high, Jeorgia's doctor warned her she would be blind and in a wheelchair by the time she was 30. But she still didn't start using insulin properly. 'I know it sounds crazy, but being thin mattered more. I told myself I'd only do it for a few more months but I just carried on and on and on,' she continued. The turning point eventually came when she was 27 when, suffering from a stabbing pain in her hands and feet, she finally decided to seek help. Warning: Jeorgia, who now weighs 13st and is a size 14, hopes her poor health will be a warning to other diabetics . 'I went into rehab and it was there that it hit home how much I was hurting my family,' said Jeorgia. 'I was so wrapped up in my diabulimia that I'd failed to see anything outside myself. I knew I needed help.' But the damage had been done and . Jeorgia needed morphine to manage the pain and has since had to have an . operation to remove dead flesh from her heel after catching an . infection. She's also been diagnosed with . gastroparesis, paralysis of the stomach, and has had to have two . vitrectomies to remove fluid from the inside of her eyeballs. Jeorgia . also underwent a round of laser treatment to try to preserve her sight. Furthermore, she has had to endure . injections in her eyes for macular edema caused by protein which has . been deposited on the eye and doctors are still not sure they will be . able to save what is left of her sight. The dangerous dieting has left her with permanent problems and Jeorgia now doesn't drive and needs Ross for even the simplest of tasks. A condition called autonomic neuropathy causes her heart to race at random and affects her blood pressure. Now, aged 29 and weighing 13st and a size 14, Jeorgia is finally working to put her life right. Together with Ross, a businessman, she has decided to delay a pancreas transplant to give her more time to try and start a family and find out what her options would be for an IVF surrogate to help them. The transplant won't cure Jeorgia's diabetes, but will give her body a rest from the condition for eight to 10 years. She added: 'After the transplant, my body will have been through a massive trauma and the chances of carrying a baby would be incredibly slim, as well as dangerous. So we want to see what our options are before we go down that road. 'I want to have a baby. I only hope I can hang on to the eyesight I have left in order to do that. 'There have been times where I've tried to push Ross away because I don't think I deserve his love. 'But he's asked me to marry him and all we can do is hope that one day we will have a child of our own. Looking back, Jeorgia said that her need to feel loved and accepted was a major driving force behind her diabulimia. 'I felt worthless because I was overweight but I wasn't enormous, I should have seen that. Even when I tried to stop, the temptation to do it to lose a few pounds for the weekend was too strong.' She hopes her experience is a warning to other young diabetes sufferers not to go down the same path she did. Although not yet an officially recognised medical condition in the UK, diabulimia is a serious emerging problem that experts predict around a third of young female diabetics could be suffering from. Deepa Khatri, a clinical advisor at Diabetes UK, said: 'People need to know that abusing insulin out of a fear of weight gain is very dangerous. 'Skipping insulin can lead to high blood glucose levels and devastating health complications like blindness, amputations and in some cases strokes.'","Jeorgia Wood, from Hampshire, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes aged 11 .

Within hours of arriving in Alicante, Spain, Miss Lyons had gone into labour and baby Ellizeah was born the following day, weighing a tiny 2lb.

She is stable in hospital at the minute so we need to get her home while it is safe to do so.

Large courier firms often face the time-consuming task of planning the most efficient routes to deliver thousands of packages around the country every single day. But a new blob of virtual goo can now do this for them - calculating the fastest travel routes which could help drastically cut the time it takes for couriers to make deliveries in the future. This could mean consumers will not have to wait as long for orders from online companies such as Amazon to arrive on their doorstep. A new 'intelligent goo' being developed by scientists can work out the shortest routes between destinations in a fraction of the time it takes current logistic managers to work out journeys for their couriers . Starting point: A blob of virtual goo is placed in a virtual petri dish with dots - highlighted in red and green - representing delivery destinations . Currently, firms still have to work out the length of every trip and which is shortest, Technology Review reports. But this becomes increasingly difficult when it involves several cities and is computationally unfeasible. So far, mathematicians have failed to find a shortcut that will solve this problem - known as the so-called P=NP debate. The best they can currently manage is just trying to calculate which routes are the quickest without having any guarantee that they in fact are the best routes. But Jeff Jones and Andrew Adamatzky at the University of the West of England have come up with a new 'intelligent' goo that could transform how delivery firms operate in the future. Under focus: The goo is then shrunk but continues to cling to the dots within the petri dish . The goo works by representing cities or destinations as dots in a virtual petri dish and then submerging them in a blob of virtual goo. The blob of goo is then shrunk but continues to cling to the dots as its shrinks - linking them across the smallest amount of surface. The resulting surface represents the best travel routes. They told Technology Review: 'As the blob shrinks it morphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities.' The goo itself consists of many particles that are placed in 'chemoattractant' - a virtual scent the particles are attracted to. Each particle senses the chemoattractant around it and then moves towards the region of highest concentration. Each then leaves behind its own trace of the chemoattractant for other particles to follow. Revelation: As the goo shrinks it begins to show the shortest possible connecting routes between the dots . Jones and Adamatzky have tested out this intelligent goo to try and solve the difficulty of calculating the best delivery routes. They used dots to represent 20 cities randomly distributed in a virtual petri dish and shrank the goo to see which routes it would leave. They then compared the results to the actual shortest path worked out manually. If the shortest route has a length 1, the intelligent blob found tours with a mean best tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour length of 1.09. Speeding things up: The 'intelligent goo' system of working out routes is considerably simpler and quicker than the traditional method of working out each individual journey manually . This means that all the results very close to the actual shortest route available but could be simply worked out in a fraction of the time it would take to do it manually. The one flaw is that the blob cannot cope with all city configurations, but it may form the basis for future systems of working out travel routes. Jones and Adamatzky say the next step would be to create a physical model of this system in which a real blob does the work. If further developed, it could later lead to logistics managers planning delivery routes by dipping road network models into vats of intelligent goo to solve their travel problems. Trial stages: Jeff Jones and Andrew Adamatzky have been testing the goo at the University of the West of England with positive results .","'Intelligent' goo created by scientists at University of the West of England .

A new £545 million hospital built under the controversial PFI scheme has run out of beds, forcing bosses to re-open wards on the the hospital it replaced. Unprecedented demand on A&E admissions at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham means two wards will be brought back into action at the neighbouring old Queen Elizabeth Hospital, which was built in the 1930s and closed in 2010. The building had stood empty before the overcrowding crisis hit and was not expected to receive patients again. The move is highly embarrassing given that the new state-of-the-art hospital is the second biggest Hospital PFI in the Midlands, and the second biggest in the NHS. Too small: The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, where the unprecedented demand on A&E admissions is forcing health bosses to reopen old wards after running out of beds . The old Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham, which closed in 2010. Patients will now be treated in the 1930s building after the new £545m hospital ran out of room . PFI schemes were a key part of the Labour government's modernisation programme for hospitals. Under the schemes, private firms paid for the building of new hospitals, with  trusts repaying them over 30 or more years, with interest. But due to the nature of the deals, the ultimate total cost is often far more than the value of the assets. Taxpayers have been left with a crippling £60billion repayment bill for hospitals built under the private finance initiative – leaving many trusts facing major financial difficulties. Trusts also agreed to pay firms for maintenance of the properties, meaning the firms can charge exorbitant sums as there can be no competition. Previous examples include hospitals having to shell out £242 just to change a padlock and £13,704 to install three lights. But NHS bosses in Birmingham have been forced to act after elective surgery for routine operations  had to be cancelled because of the capacity problems. The move comes despite the fact the trust has already laid on 117 additional beds over the winter period. Birmingham’s biggest hospital opened on June 10 with 1,213 beds, replacing two outdated buildings, including the old Queen Elizabeth. Royal seal of approval: The hospital was officially named by the Queen when she visited Birmingham during her 2012 Diamond Jubilee celebrations . The hospital, where the Queen greeted members of the public, . was Birmingham's first new acute hospital for 70 years when it began receiving patients in 2010 . The finance behind the project came . from Consort Healthcare Ltd, which is part of the construction firm . Balfour Beatty, a key player in PFI schemes. The contract lasts for 40 years from the date of financial close – when all legal matters were agreed – which was in June 2006. The new hospital, in Edgbaston, may also . be a victim of its own success, as patients from the region travel to . the widely-praised facility in preference to local clinics.

Foundation Trust which runs the hospital, said it needed to reopen the . old wards 'to meet the unprecedented demand on services across . the region and, in particular, on the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital'. She said the Midlands region had seen a 10 per cent increase in admissions to accident and emergency departments. Dame Julie said the trust was 'proactively responding to a steep rise in the number of GP referrals, self-presenting patients and emergency admissions'. Speaking on BBC Radio West Midlands, she said: 'We’ve seen the biggest number of patients coming in since we’ve been keeping records. 'We’ve got an ageing population, people with chronic disease, people are living longer and we’ve had the winter period. 'We’re seeing far, far more patients than we did have. Clearly we built the new hospital because the old hospitals didn’t meet the standards of the 21st century. 'What we’re not doing is looking after patients in corridors, but this way they’re in a proper ward environment.' She said the refitted wards would meet 'the highest' infection-control standards. The new Queen Elizabeth Hospital was Birmingham’s first new acute hospital for 70 years when it began receiving patients in 2010. Labour launched its 2010 General Election manifesto at the new site, which was officially named by the Queen when she visited Birmingham during her 2012 Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The parts of the old hospital that will be re-opened will be next to the new buildings. So far 52 beds have been opened in the most modern part of the old hospital building.But two wards of 36 beds each will this week be opened in the older part of the building, which was built between built between 1933 and 1934. But the trust says it has seen a 20 per cent increase in patients coming in to the hospital and has 'completely filled' the new Queen Elizabeth. Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust said it needed to re-open the old wards 'to meet the unprecedented demand on services across the region' The trust the said the refitted wards would meet 'the highest' infection-control standards . When the new building first opened, the hospital’s accident and emergency department would receive around 30 or 40 patients on a typical Saturday. In recent weeks, that figure has reached 120. Other methods of dealing with increased patient numbers, including commissioning treatment from the private sector, have already been tried. And the Trust has also suspended its . policy of keeping a single ward in the new hospital empty at any given . moment, for refurbishment and cleaning. The . aim was to ensure that every ward was redecorated and deep cleaned on a . regular basis, to reduce the rate of hospital acquired infections. But . could only be done while the ward was empty of patients, and the . hospital is now being forced to keep all its wards open permanently, . creating an extra 36 beds. The trust has now reluctantly taken the . decision to re-open two wards, one for men and one for women, in part of . the old hospital known as West Block. A spokesman for University Hospitals . Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The trust is proactively . responding to a steep rise in the number of GP referrals, . self-presenting patients and emergency admissions. 'This . rise has impacted on elective surgery and rather than see operations . cancelled we are increasing capacity to ensure we can continue to . deliver timely care to the people who come to us for our quality . interventions and expertise. Unprecedented demand: The old hospital (pictured) is needed as the NHS is unable to cope with a massive increase in demand for treatment, caused partly by the region's aging population . 'The . region has seen a 10 per cent increase in A&E attendances in the . first quarter of the year. University Hospital Birmingham is seeing 65 . per cent of this figure.' The spokesman insisted there was no cause for concern about hygiene or patient safety. 'The Trust’s stringent policies on infection prevention and control are implemented across the entire hospital site by staff who are trained to uphold standards that have the patient’s safety and hygiene at the centre of everything we do. The two wards being opened will be configured and equipped to ensure the highest level of hygiene.' PFI projects have been embroiled in controversy for a number of years. Another hospital, the . Norfolk and Norwich was completed in 200, but faced hundreds of job cuts as it sought to balance its books, . And just last month it was announced that a state-of-the-art police station is to cost taxpayers a total of £21million over the next 30 years, even though it is closed to the public. The front desk at the station, which opened 11 years ago in a 30-year private finance deal, is shut to save costs, and has been replaced by a mobile police van in the car park for eight-hours-a-week. But police are still committed to handing over £700,000-a-year for the station at Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, South Wales, in the finance deal until 2031. The total cost for the building, which provides a home for the force's Hi-tech Crime Unit and the Neighbourhood Policing Team for the Amman Towry area, will be £21m - almost 10 times the cost of building the station.","Birmingham's new Queen Elizabeth Hospital officially opened last year .

Big change is coming to the lives of the lesbian couple at the center of the fight for same-sex marriage in California no matter how the Supreme Court decides their case. After 13 years of raising four boys together, Kris Perry and Sandy Stier are about to be empty nesters. Their youngest two children, 18-year-old twins, will graduate from high school in June and head off to college a couple of months later. 'We'll see all the movies, get theater season tickets because you can actually go,' Ms Stier said in the living room of their bungalow in Berkeley. Life will not revolve quite so much around food, and the challenge of putting enough of it on the table to feed teenagers. Scroll down for video . Time for change: Sandy Stier, 50 (left) and Kris Perry, 48, are the couple at the center of the Supreme Court's reconsideration of Proposition 8, the law recognizing marriage as only between a man and a woman . They might also get married, if the high court case goes their way. Ms Perry, 48, and Ms Stier, 50, set aside their lunch hour on a recent busy Friday to talk to The Associated Press about their Supreme Court case, the evolution of their activism for gay rights and family life. On Tuesday, they plan to be in the courtroom when their lawyer, Theodore Olson, tries to persuade the justices to strike down California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages and to declare that gay couples can marry nationwide. Supporters of California's Proposition 8, represented by lawyer Charles Cooper, argue that the court should not override the democratic process and impose a judicial solution that would redefine marriage in the 40 states that do not allow same-sex couples to wed. A second case, set for Wednesday, involves the part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that prevents same-sex couples who are legally married from receiving a range of federal tax, pension and other benefits that otherwise are available to married people. The Supreme Court hearing is the moment Ms Perry and Ms Stier, along with Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, have been waiting for since they agreed four years ago to be the named plaintiffs and public faces of a well-funded, high-profile effort to challenge Proposition 8 in the courts. 'When you've been out as long as I have . been, 30 years, you can't dwell as much on what's not working as maybe . people think you do' 'For the past four years, we've lived . our lives in this hurry-up-and-wait, pins-and-needles way,' Ms Perry . said, recalling the crush of court deadlines and the seemingly endless . wait for rulings from a federal district judge, the 9th U.S. Circuit . Court of Appeals, also based there, and the California Supreme Court. Ms Stier said Mr Olson told them the case could take several years to resolve. 'I thought, years?' she said. But the couple has been riding a marriage rollercoaster since 2003, when Ms Perry first asked Ms Stier to marry her. They . were planning a symbolic, but not legally recognized, wedding when San . Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered city officials to issue marriage . licenses to same-sex couples in 2004. So they were married, but only . briefly. Six months later, the state Supreme Court invalidated the same-sex unions. They went ahead with their plans anyway, but 'it was one of the sadder points of our wedding,' Ms Perry said. Wedding bells? The couple - who have been together for 13 years - plan to marry quickly if the Court rules to legalize gay marriage . Less than four years later, however, the same state court overturned California's prohibition on same-sex unions. Then, on the same day Ms Perry and Ms . Stier rejoiced in President Barack Obama's election, voters approved . Proposition 8, undoing the court ruling and defining marriage as the . union of a man and a woman. Their lawsuit was filed six months later, . after they went to the Alameda County courthouse for a marriage license . and were predictably refused. 'It's such a weird road we've been on,' Ms Perry said. All the more so because neither woman defined herself as a gay rights activist before the marriage fight. Ms Perry, a native Californian from . Bakersfield, and Ms Stier, who grew up in rural Iowa, moved in together . in 2000, with Ms Stier's two children from a heterosexual marriage and . Ms Perry's from a previous relationship. Utterly conventional school . meetings, soccer games and band practice - not the court case - have . defined their lives together. As if to highlight this point, their . son, Elliott, briefly interrupted the interview to ask for a pair of . headphones. Ms Perry said the boys find her useful for two basic reasons . these days. 'Do I have any headphones and do I have any money?' she . said with a smile. Ms . Perry has spent her professional life advocating on behalf of early . childhood education. Ms Stier works for the county government's public . health department. 'When . you've been out as long as I have been, 30 years, in order to feel OK . every day and be optimistic and productive, you can't dwell as much on . what's not working as maybe people think you do,' Ms Perry said. Even with Proposition 8's passage, Ms Perry and Ms Stier said they were more focused on Obama's election. 'I was all about health care reform . and Kris is all about education reform and that was everything. Gay . rights, that would be great, but it's a way off,' Ms Stier said. 'We did the big celebration a long time ago. I hope this will be something a lot bigger than the two of us' They don't take the issue so lightly . anymore. Of course, they could not imagine a U.S. president would . endorse gay marriage along with voters in three states just last . November. When Obama talked about equal rights for gay Americans in his inaugural speech in January, Ms Perry said she felt as if 'we've arrived at the adults' table. We're no longer at the kids' table.' They will watch the argument in their case and then return home to wait for the decision, worried that it could come the same day as the boys' high school graduations in mid-June. They know the court could uphold Proposition 8, which would almost certainly lead to an effort to repeal it by California voters. Recent polls show support for repeal. Any other outcome will allow them to get married. But Ms Perry said they are hoping the court strikes 'a tone of more inclusion' and issues the broadest possible ruling. They will get married quickly, in a small, private ceremony. 'We did the big celebration a long time ago,' Ms Perry said. 'I hope this will be something a lot bigger than the two of us.'","Kris Perry and Sandy Stier agreed four .

But Aria's devastated parents believe it was their daughter's first time at inhaling the chemical and insist she had meant to kill herself.

Kristal's horrifying death is a nightmare for her parents and a warning for families everywhere about the dangerous trend of teenagers tapping air conditioning units to inhale the freon gas. As well as death, the terrifying trend can cause long-term effects including damage to the kidneys, liver and brain.

Argentina's foreign minister demanded talks with Britain on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, but Britain again refused, pointing to the islanders' overwhelming vote this month to remain British. Hector Timerman, speaking Tuesday at the United Nations, called the referendum 'illegal' and said it is 'truly deplorable' that Britain has rejected 40 resolutions by the U.N. Decolonization Committee calling for negotiations between the two countries on sovereignty. Timerman was flanked at a press conference by ministers representing major Latin American and Caribbean organizations, saying he wanted to demonstrate the region's unity in support of Argentina's claim to the islands and its demand for sovereignty talks. Argentina's Hector Timerman, left, called the referendum 'illegal' but Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant countered that the Falkland Islanders exercised their right to self-determination through the referendum . Visitors: Ban Ki-moon, centre, with visiting Foreign ministers at the UN headquarters in New York . The islands in the south Atlantic have been British territory since 1765, but Argentina accuses Britain of invading the islands, which it claims and calls the Malvinas. Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant countered that the Falkland Islanders exercised their right to self-determination under the U.N. Charter in a referendum this month, and 99.8 percent of voters said they want to remain a British overseas territory. 'The United Kingdom government's position will remain that there will not and cannot be any discussions on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until the islanders so wish,' Lyall Grant said. 'Their views are now unequivocally on the record and should be respected by all.' Jubilant: Falkland islanders cheer after hearing the results of the referendum to remain part of Britain . An overwhelming yes: 98.8 per cent of eligible voters in the Falkland Islands voted to remain a part of Britain . Timerman denounced Britain's 'military invasion' of the Falklands but said Argentina wants a peaceful settlement. He claimed that Britain wants the Falklands as a military base 'with high offensive technology close to the Antarctic and close to the only natural waterway between the Atlantic and the Pacific.' He called this 'a strategic colonialist decision.' Timerman also accused Britain of refusing to answer 'if there are nuclear submarines or not in the area of the south Atlantic, which is an area of peace where the entry of nuclear weapons is prohibited.' Lyall Grant said Timerman's claim that Britain is militarizing the south Atlantic 'is completely untrue.' After Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, Britain increased its defense presence to deter any future aggression, but Lyall Grant said it has not changed substantially in the last 30 years. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner dismissed the referendum result in the Falkland Islands as 'a parody' Earlier Tuesday, Timerman met Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon along with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, representing the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States; Uruguay's Foreign Minister Luis Almargo, representing South America's Mercosur trade bloc; and Peru's Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Beraun, on behalf of the Union of South American Nations. Timerman said the secretary-general told the ministers that Britain again rejected his offer of good offices to negotiate on sovereignty of the islands. Lyall Grant said Britain doesn't see any need for Ban's good offices and has made it clear to Argentina that the views of the islanders must be taken into account in any discussions. Strong words: David Cameron said Buenos Aires should take 'careful note' of the referendum, which went 99.8 per cent in favour of remaining a British overseas territory . Uruguay's Almargo accused Britain of seeking to exploit the islands' energy resources and called the referendum 'dysfunctional,' saying it is not right to cut off part of Argentina through a referendum. He added that the dispute is 'becoming intolerable' for Latin America and for the U.N. itself. Earlier this month Argentina was warned to respect the wishes of the Falkland Islanders following their overwhelming vote to remain British. David Cameron said Buenos Aires should take ‘careful note’ of the referendum, which went 99.8 per cent in favour of remaining a British overseas territory. Just three unidentified islanders voted to end British sovereignty three decades on from the Falklands conflict. A total of 1,517 valid votes were cast in the referendum, a turnout of 92 per cent of the eligible islanders. The question was: ‘Do you wish the Falkland Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?’ Argentine president Cristina Kirchner has branded Falkland Islanders ‘squatters’ She claimed: ‘It’s like a consortium of squatters voting on whether they’re going to continue illegally occupying a building or not. The result was a foregone conclusion.’ Mrs Kirchner went on to dismiss the poll as a ‘parody’. Argentina insists that the islands it calls Las Malvinas were forcibly  taken from Argentina by the British in 1833. Britain says the argument is unfounded, because no Argentine civilian population was ever expelled. Tensions between the two nations have escalated over the possibility of lucrative oil reserves in the region, which lie around 8,000 miles from the UK in the South Atlantic.","Argentina's foreign minister demanded .

Amanda Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend Rafaele Sollecito was so confident that their acquittals for the murder of Meredith Kercher would be upheld that he had planned a new life in Switzerland. The 29-year-old was planning to move to Lugano in Switzerland to start up an internet security firm, it was claimed today. But his plans may have been thwarted after Italy's highest court yesterday quashed the acquittal of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito. Scroll down for video . Amanda Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito  was so confident that their acquittals for the murder of Meredith Kercher would be upheld by Italy's highest court that he had planned a new life in Switzerland. Decision: Knox is to face a retrial over the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher . 'We weren't expecting a negative outcome', Mr Sollecito told a lecturer at Verona University, where he is studying information technology and robotics, according to Corriere della Sera newspaper. 'I was thinking everything would be cleared up.' Mr Sollecito has apparently denied suggestions that he was still contemplating fleeing to Switzerland in order to avoid the retrial. 'Switzerland would hardly be a good country to flee to, it's not Brazil,' he reportedly told a friend. He pointed out that it was close to Italy and had an extradition treaty with Rome. Knox and Sollecito spoke on the phone soon after yesterday’s verdict. Sollecito’s current girlfriend Annie Achille said: ‘They will see what can be done.’ She added that her boyfriend, who turned 29 yesterday, is ‘destroyed’ and not talking to anyone. Yesterday’s ruling by the supreme court in Rome means the case will be tried again next year after judges accepted that there were ‘contradictions’ in the case. In a dramatic turnaround, the pair, who both spent four years behind bars before they were cleared in 2011, were told they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old British student. Knox, who has rebuilt her life in her home town of Seattle, cannot be compelled by Italian law to appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at all. Sollecito remained in Italy and is . studying robotic surgery at the University of Verona. He has already . released a book about his experience. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were seen kissing in the wake of the murder . In it he said that he and Knox were still in touch – he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype regularly. Meredith Kercher, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University. She was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the picturesque hilltop town of Perugia. Her throat had been slit and her semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively, . But two years later the pair were freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA evidence contaminated. A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal.","The 29-year-old was planning to move to Lugano in Switzerland .

NFL player Desmond Bryant may have a lucrative new contract, but his legal troubles are far from over as he's been sued over an incident that spawned one the world's most bizarre mugshots. A lawsuit seeking unspecified damages was filed yesterday in Miami-Dade circuit court against Bryant, 27, who inked a five-year, $34million deal with the Cleveland Browns last week. Bryant told police that he thought he was at his home when a taxi dropped him off after a night of drinking in Miami in the early morning hours of February 24. Mugshot: Desmond Bryant posed for this bizarre booking photo after he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief on February 24 . But it wasn't his house. It was the home of Isaac Bakar, a 43-year-old contractor who thought the massive athlete was there to rob the place. At 5'11"" and 173 pounds, Mr Bakar struggled to hold the door to keep the 6'6"" and 311-pound defensive lineman from entering while his wife called 911. The Bakars charge that Bryant tried to break down the door, and even ripped off a door handle. The family's attorney, Robert Fiore, told the Miami Herald: 'They were scared. My client was holding on for dear life. The paper reported that Bryant was still furiously punching at the door when cops arrived. He was arrested and charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief, and later released after posting $1,000 bail. Write caption here . The lineman's peculiar booking photo from the February incident, which shows him shirtless and with his mouth gaping open, has since become an internet phenomenon. The defensive lineman has apologized for his arrest last month, saying the incident was a 'mistake' and that 'it's really not the kind of person that I am.' But the Bakars' attorney says it's a mistake he'll have to pay for, telling the Herald: 'We allege that Mr Bryant made more than a simple, inconsequential mistake, and that Mr Bryant’s conduct has significant legal consequences.' Bryant said he's moved on from the incident, and Browns CEO Joe Banner said the team has no concerns about Bryant's character. Representatives for Bryant could not immediately be reached for comment.

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 08:33 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:18 EST, 20 March 2013 . European Union lawmakers are expected to agree today to bar bankers in Europe from getting bonuses bigger than their salary, introducing the first cap of its kind globally. One of the most ambitious reforms of the financial crisis, the cap is designed to address public anger at a bonus-driven culture many European politicians believe encouraged the risk-taking that pulled down banks and governments. It is set to be introduced from next year despite the objections of Britain. The Chancellor fears capping bankers' bonuses will lead to an exodus from the City of London to other financial centres, like New York . The defeat is a significant blow to the UK, which had argued a bonus cap would have a disproportionate impact on the City of London. It will raise fresh concerns about Britain’s ability to defend the City from a wave of financial regulations being plotted by Brussels. Defeat: Britain's finance minister, George Osborne, tried to change the rules at a meeting of EU finance ministers but no one supported him . Finance leaders fears the rules will drive away talent and restrict growth. While some token concessions are . possible to show goodwill towards the bloc's financial hub of London, . the decision on a cap will not be reversed. EU officials indicated that there could be a further delay to the introduction of the new rules until the middle of 2014 to allow countries time to complete legal preparations - a delay that could spare bankers for one more bonus season. Lawmakers from the European Parliament and diplomats representing EU countries are to begin talks on finalising the bonus rules at 1730 GMT. Officials expect a deal to be clinched. 'This was a sobering experience,' said one official familiar with British thinking, who asked not to be named. 'It's the first time the UK was outvoted on financial services. 'There are autopsies being carried out at the UK Treasury. They will only ask for marginal changes but they cannot change the fundamental direction,' he said. One European diplomat predicted only 'minor tweaks'. The rules, part of a wider capital regime for banks, would limit banker bonuses to the equivalent of their salary, or two times their salary if shareholders agree. They represent the toughest bonus regime anywhere in the world. Earlier this month, Britain's finance minister, George Osborne, tried to change the rules at a meeting of EU finance ministers but no one supported him. His inability to fend off the reform underscored Britain's waning influence in the EU and is also likely to fuel deepening euro scepticism in Britain. Consequences: Mr Osborne warned a cap on bonuses could result in banks pushing up salaries to top executives, which would be even harder to claw back in the event of failure . At the time employers’ organisation the CBI reacted with dismay, saying: ‘The proposals will damage the competitiveness of the EU’s financial services industry, hitting the UK particularly hard, at a time when growth should be the key priority.’ Downing Street said David Cameron had ‘real concerns’ about the proposals, while London Mayor Boris Johnson said the ‘deluded’ plan would simply drive top bankers overseas.

Last month Downing Street said David Cameron, left, had ‘real concerns’ about the proposals, while London Mayor Boris Johnson, right, said the ‘deluded’ plan would simply drive top bankers overseas . ‘Our concern is that it may have a perverse effect, it may undermine responsibility in the banking system rather than promote it,’ he said. The cap has already been softened by allowing banks to discount the future value of share options, bonds or other non-cash payments paid out over more than five years. As it stands, one quarter of a banker's bonus can be paid in this way but, in an attempt to soften the blow for Britain, this ratio could be raised in the final round of negotiations. Such alterations, however, would have only a slight impact on the total amount of bonus that can be paid. Furthermore, any changes will require the approval of the European Parliament, which pushed for the clampdown in a wider law that chiefly deals with increasing the capital that banks hold to make them safer.","It is set to be introduced from next year despite the objections of Britain .

A former media director for Syracuse University's athletics department today admitted he secretly videotaped more than 100 football players and other male athletes in locker rooms. Roger Springfield pleaded guilty to a single count of unlawful surveillance, and confessed to another three counts of secretly filming young boys at the New York State school and others. The 57-year-old former sportscaster for a Syracuse television station was originally charged in January after a fellow Syracuse University staffer uncovered 15 minutes of the footage while working on a football highlights video in December. In exchange for his guilty plea, Springfield was told today by the judge he'll be sentenced in June to 10 years' probation. He could have faced four years in state prison. The judge is also expected to rule on whether Springfield should be required to register as a sex offender. Guilty: Roger Springfield, pictured today, pleaded guilty to a single count of unlawful surveillance, and confessed to another three counts of secretly filming young boys . Syracuse fired Springfield when the videos first came to light. Prosecutors said he made four secret videos in the Carrier Dome locker rooms used by the football, men's lacrosse and soccer teams. Police said Springfield, whose real name is Roger Cahak, set up a camera at waist level and covered a red light that indicated the power was on. Before SU hired him as director of media properties and productions, Springfield was a sportscaster for 11 years at WSTM-TV. He was employed by the university for nearly a decade. His Defense attorney Jim McGraw claims his client should not be be put on the sex offender list because he's not a 'sexual threat.' 'He has no interest in men or boys,' McGraw said today, according to Syracuse.com. 'He has no interest in anybody other than his wife.' Investigation: Prosecutors said the charges stem from at least four secret videos the 57-year-old Springfield made between the spring of 2010 and November 2012 in the Carrier Dome . McGraw said Springfield taped the young athletes because of his childhood, but did not elaborate further. He said he provided the judge with a psychiatric assessment for his client. But Assistant District Attorney Jeremy Cali said that is was 'clear from the content' of the footage that Springfield is a threat and should be listed because he committed a registrable offense. Springfield is due to be sentenced on June 6 but McGraw asked today if the hearing could be brought forward. '(Springfield) wants to get on with his life,' the lawyer said outside of court. 'His wife is gone, his reputation is ruined. There's no sense prolonging a trial.' The former media director for Syracuse University's athletic department initially pleaded not guilty in January to charges that he secretly filmed at least 108 athletes taking post-game showers. Roger Springfield was arraigned in Onondaga County Court on January 16 on four counts of unlawful surveillance. TV career: Before SU hired him, Springfield, pictured in 1991, was a sportscaster for 11 years at WSTM-TV . Decade: Springfield, left, was at the school for nearly a decade . The charges stem from at least four secret videos the 57-year-old made between the spring of 2010 and November 2012 in the Carrier Dome. Authorities said Springfield made the videos in the locker rooms of the football team and the men's lacrosse and soccer teams. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said the investigation began after a Syracuse employee noticed 'clearly inappropriate material' on an 'exceptionally long' segment of locker-room footage on a video from Syracuse's football game against South Florida on October 27 in Tampa, Florida.

After . reviewing the tapes, Springfield's home and the media room at Manley . Field House were searched. Springfield was questioned by detectives, . suspended and then fired by the university on December 13. Fitzpatrick said the charges stemmed from videos that included the Louisville football game on November 10, a soccer game last year and two lacrosse games in 2010. Authorities have identified 108 victims, all of them male athletes. Fitzpatrick said there is no evidence that Springfield disseminated the recordings or still images to anyone else. There also is no evidence that Springfield engaged in any inappropriate sexual contact with any of the athletes, the district attorney said. Filming: Authorities said Springfield made the videos in the locker rooms of the football team and the men's lacrosse and soccer teams . Authorities said at least 10 other videos were found, including one made in Massachusetts and one shot in Akron, Ohio, but they fell outside the statute of limitations. Fitzpatrick said investigators quickly discounted the fact that the footage might have been accidental. 'You can see him setting up the camera, and it appears from the evidence uncovered that he placed the camera at waist level and used a piece of tape to conceal the red light on top of the camera indicating it was on and working,' Fitzpatrick said. 'This is in no stretch of the imagination a victimless crime.' Syracuse has reached out to all student-athletes involved to offer them support and assistance, said Kevin Quinn, senior vice president for public affairs.","Roger Springfield, 57, pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful surveillance and admitted to three others .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 19:12 EST, 25 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:12 EST, 25 February 2013 . With his long silver beard and white braided uniform, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop became one of the most recognizable figures of the Reagan era - and one of the most unexpectedly enduring. His nomination in 1981 met a wall of opposition from women's groups and liberal politicians, who said President Ronald Reagan selected Koop, a pediatric surgeon and evangelical Christian from Philadelphia, only because of his conservative views, especially his staunch opposition to abortion. Soon, though, he was a hero to AIDS activists, who chanted 'Koop, Koop' at his appearances but booed other officials. Gone: Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop died on Monday at his home in Hanover, New Hampshire. He was 96. And when he left his post in 1989, he left behind a landscape where AIDS was a top research and educational priority, smoking was considered a public health hazard and access to abortion remained largely intact. Koop, who turned his once-obscure post into a bully pulpit for seven years during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and who surprised both ends of the political spectrum by setting aside his conservative personal views on issues such as homosexuality and abortion to keep his focus sharply medical, died on Monday at his home in Hanover, New Hampshire. He was 96. An assistant at Koop's Dartmouth College institute, Susan Wills, confirmed his death but didn't disclose its cause. Although the surgeon general has no real authority to set government policy, Koop described himself as 'the health conscience of the country' and said modestly just before leaving his post that 'my only influence was through moral suasion.' Public figure: Koop, pictured in 1988, was by far the best-known surgeon general, and decades after he left the job he was still a recognized personality . Koop shocked his conservative supporters when he endorsed condoms and sex education to stop the spread of AIDS. He carried out a crusade to end smoking in the United States - his goal had been to do so by 2000. A former pipe smoker, he said cigarettes were as addictive as heroin and cocaine. Even after leaving office, he continued to promote public health causes, from preventing childhood accidents to better training for doctors. 'I will use the written word, the spoken word and whatever I can in the electronic media to deliver health messages to this country as long as people will listen,' he promised. In 1996, he rapped Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole for suggesting that tobacco is not invariably addictive, saying Dole's comments 'either exposed his abysmal lack of knowledge of nicotine addiction or his blind support of the tobacco industry.' Although Koop eventually won wide respect with his blend of old-fashioned values, pragmatism and empathy, his nomination met staunch opposition. Foes noted that Koop traveled the country in 1979 and 1980 giving speeches that predicted a progression 'from liberalized abortion to infanticide to passive euthanasia to active euthanasia, indeed to the very beginnings of the political climate that led to Auschwitz, Dachau and Belsen.' But Koop, a devout Presbyterian, was confirmed after he told a Senate panel he would not use the surgeon general's post to promote his religious ideology. He kept his word. In 1986, he issued a frank report on AIDS, urging the use of condoms for 'safe sex' and advocating sex education as early as third grade. Outspoken: In 1986, Koop iissued a frank report on AIDS, urging the use of condoms for 'safe sex' and advocating sex education as early as third grade . He also maneuvered around uncooperative . Reagan administration officials in 1988 to send an educational AIDS . pamphlet to more than 100 million U.S. households, the largest public . health mailing ever. Koop personally opposed homosexuality and believed sex should be saved for marriage. But he insisted that Americans, especially young people, must not die because they were deprived of explicit information about how HIV was transmitted. Working through retirement: Even after leaving office, Koop continued to promote public health causes, from preventing childhood accidents to better training for doctors . Koop further angered conservatives by . refusing to issue a report requested by the Reagan White House, saying . he could not find enough scientific evidence to determine whether . abortion has harmful psychological effects on women. Koop maintained his personal opposition to abortion, however. After he left office, he told medical students it violated their Hippocratic oath. In 2009, he wrote Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid urging that health care legislation include a provision to ensure doctors and medical students would not be forced to perform abortions. The letter briefly set off a security scare because it was hand delivered. Koop served as chairman of the National Safe Kids Campaign and as an adviser to President Bill Clinton's health care reform plan. At a congressional hearing in 2007, Koop spoke about political pressure on the surgeon general post. He said Reagan was pressed to fire him every day, but Reagan would not interfere. Koop, worried that medicine had lost old-fashioned caring and personal relationships between doctors and patients, opened an institute at Dartmouth to teach medical students basic values and ethics. He also was a part-owner of a short-lived venture, drkoop.com, to provide consumer health care information via the Internet. Koop was born in New York's borough of Brooklyn, the only son of a Manhattan banker and the nephew of a doctor. Friends in high places: Koop is pictured alongside then-first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in this 1993 photo at the White House . He said by age 5 he knew he wanted to be a surgeon and at age 13 he practiced his skills on neighborhood cats. He attended Dartmouth, where he received the nickname Chick, short for 'chicken Koop.' It stuck for life. Koop was by far the best-known surgeon general, and decades after he left the job he was still a recognized personality. 'I was walking down the street with him one time' about five years ago, recalled Dr George Wohlreich, director of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, a medical society with which Koop had longstanding ties. 'People were yelling out, `There goes Dr Koop!' You'd have thought he was a rock star.' Pioneer: Koop received his medical degree at Cornell Medical College, choosing pediatric surgery because so few surgeons practiced it . Dr Joseph O'Donnell, an oncologist and professor at the Geisel School of Medicine, where the Koop Institute is located, said he shared Koop's desire to focus on disease prevention. 'When he decided he was going to come here, I felt like I died and went to heaven,' said Donnell, the senior scholar at the institute. 'He was my hero, and we worked a lot together.' Koop received his medical degree at Cornell Medical College, choosing pediatric surgery because so few surgeons practiced it. In 1938, Koop married Elizabeth Flanagan, the daughter of a Connecticut doctor. They had four children - Allen, Norman, David and Elizabeth. David, their youngest son, was killed in a mountain-climbing accident when he was 20. Koop's wife died in 2007, and he married Cora Hogue in 2010. Koop was appointed surgeon-in-chief at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and served as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He pioneered surgery on newborns and successfully separated three sets of conjoined twins. He won national acclaim by reconstructing the chest of a baby born with the heart outside the body. Although raised as a Baptist, he was drawn to a Presbyterian church near the hospital, where he developed an abiding faith. He began praying at the bedside of his young patients - ignoring the snickers of some of his colleagues. 'It used to be said in World War II that there were no atheists in foxholes,' he wrote in 1973. 'I have found there are very few atheists among the parents of dying children. 'This is a time when religious faith can see a family through trying circumstances.'","Koop, a surgeon and surgeon general under Reagan and George H.W. Bush, dies at New Hampshire home .

'The family felt strongly that, to properly explore their native ways, I needed to join in the nudist activities.' After a few hours of convincing, she says 'I shrugged my shoulders, suppressed my panic and acquiesced.' The nudist camp consisted of a lake, grassy fields covered in goose and duck droppings and a few trees. And hundreds of naked Germans, who more than anything were there to top up their tans, she recalled. Once she got the hang of the rules - don't ogle people below the neck mid-conversation (though sneaking a peak after is fine) - she relaxed. And then they started playing basketball.

Famed fashion photographer Steven Meisel has opened up the doors of his lavish mid-century Los Angeles home, which is rumored to be on the market for $15million. The 6,300-square-foot mansion, in the exclusive Trousdale Estates area of Beverly Hills, could be straight off the set of Mad Men with its Sixties-inspired architecture and furnishings. Indeed, you could imagine Don Draper enjoying the luxury perks of one room, which combines a master bathroom and office in one.

Even after renovation, it maintains its Sixties charm with vintage mid-century pieces and accents . Mr Meisel, a notoriously private man, told the Architectural Digest that the 'space was my idea'. Fashion photographer: Mr Meisel has shot campaigns for design labels including Versace, Valentino, Dolce and Gabbana and Calvin Klein . 'It just made sense to me - take a shower, get dressed, make a few calls, and do a little work. I love that room,' he said. Other standout features include mountain views, a large swimming pool and dozens of open-plan rooms decorated with marble, onyx, teak, and walnut detailing. Mr Meisel, who is credited with launching the careers of many models, including Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Karen Elson, purchased the property shortly after shooting a Versace campaign in the neighborhood in 2000. Talking about what attracted him to the dwelling, designed in 1963, by architect George MacLean, he recalled: 'I was told it was built for a race-car driver and his model wife, which sounded just about right. 'The house had never really been renovated, so it felt authentic to the period.' After he moved in, the property was . rebuilt and expanded, with architects adding 2,300 square feet to the . existing 4,000-square-foot building. However great care was taken to preserve the original Sixties detailing. Artistic interiors: Mr Meisner came up with the idea for this unique combination office/master bathroom, which features green onyx walls, Jim Thompson silk curtains, and a sculpture by Dorothy Draper . Ron Radziner, of the Los Angeles-based . firm Marmol Radziner, who served as the project’s lead architect, . explained that they took the building's original features and 'expanded . on them'. 'Even though the house is completely . rebuilt, it still has the same spirit. That was something Steven felt . very passionate about,' he recounted. 'The greatest thing going for the house was its rough stone walls, which gave it a Hawaiian-ranch-modern feeling.' Once the building work was complete, water features were installed in the grounds complemented with dense tropical planting. Chic details: Mr Meisel's bedroom includes vintage Tommi Parzinger lamps, a custom-designed headboard by interior designer Brad Dunning, and rare Macassar ebony bedside tables . 'Everything feels very lush and generous,' Mr Radziner added. For the interiors Mr Meisel recruited designer Brad Dunning, to ensure that the furnishings also had a retro feel. 'This was the most visually confirmed project I’ve ever done,' said Mr Dunning. 'Steven and I both love mining vintage periodicals and books. After going through stacks of archival material, we knew exactly what it was supposed to be.' The Trousdale Estates was developed in the Fifties and Sixties on a 410-acre plot of land by Paul Trousdale, and consists of luxurious, mostly single-story homes.

While the Trousdales area is popular . today, luring celebrities such as Simon Cowell, Jennifer Aniston and . Ellen DeGeneres, it wasn't the place to be when Mr Meisel moved in. 'Back then it wasn’t popular at all. I . remember asking my friend Herb Ritts about it and he told me, ""It’s for . old 1960s movie stars. Nobody lives there.’"" However Mr Meisel fell in love with the area and the risk paid off. 'This neighborhood has an incredible history, and it still inspires me,' he said. 'When I moved in, people kept telling me that it wasn’t cool and it wasn’t sophisticated. They were wrong.'",The Beverly Hills residence is rumored to be on the market for $15million .

Bookies were counting the cost of Europe's Ryder Cup victory after a stunning final-day comeback was rounded off by a remarkable gesture of sportsmanship by America's Tiger Woods. Jose Maria Olazabal's side recorded a 14½ to 13½ outright win in Medinah, Illinois, following a string of heroic performances by the likes of Luke Donald, Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy. They played their part in ensuring Europe retained the trophy they won two years ago, but it was Woods who handed them outright victory in the final match of the tournament. By beating Francesco Molinari in the final pairing of the weekend he could have at least ensured a 14-14 draw for the USA. Scroll down for video . The moment: Francesco Molinari of Europe (right) shakes hands with Tiger Woods of the USA (left) on the 18th green after halving his match with the American during the 39th Ryder Cup in Chicago, Illinois . He led going in to the final hole, but missed a three-foot par putt. And in a show of sportsmanship, he declined to force Molinari to make a . putt from a similar distance, thus conceding the hole to the Italian . and leaving their match all-square. The gesture handed Europe an outright win that few would have predicted at the . start of the day, leaving the European fans cheering - and the bookies . fuming after they saw a flurry of bets placed from the optimistic few who did fancy the unlikely result. The betting firms today admitted they were facing a combined . multi-million payout in what was their most expensive ever Ryder Cup, . despite the fact that just moments earlier they had been looking at their . ideal result of a draw.

Paddy Power lost around £800,000, Betfred suffered a £400,000 hit and Sky Bet lost £500,000. Industry experts said the late drama cost UK betting companies around £10million in total. A Ladbrokes spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘No-one bets on a tie. It cost us just over £650,000 last night on Tiger’s miss. Tiger is not a bookie’s friend this morning. ‘At 8:20pm, Europe were 33/1 to win and USA were 1/50. It was a nightmare result. The USA were heavily backed pre-tournament. We were so close. It was our most expensive one ever.’ Europe's team staged a remarkable comeback to retain the Ryder Cup, battling from 10-6 down overnight - having trailed 10-4 - to beat the United States 14½ to 13½ in Chicago, Illinois. After Europe reached the 14 points they required to retain the cup, Woods knew heading to the 18th tee that the USA could no longer win. He later claimed neither he nor the USA wanted to salvage a tie. After Woods missed his final putt, he conceded one from a similar length to halve his contest with Molinari - a putt which he would have been expected to hold. A Sky Bet spokesman told Sporting Life: ‘While it was impossible not to get caught up in such a fantastic victory, Woods's miss resulted in us taking a really heavy beating.

And the cup was already been retained by Europe, so it was already over. ‘You come here as a team and you win or lose as a team, and it's pointless to even finish. So 18 was just, hey, get this over with. Congratulations to the European team.’ That incident rounded off a dismal three days for Woods in which he failed to win a single match.

Waiting: Voters stand in line outside a Fort Myers, Florida church, where some had to wait six hours to cast their ballots . Chaos: An aerial view above a polling place in Miami shows the line of voters that extended into the parking lot . The Miami Herald reported that about 70 per cent of voting precincts are remaining open, where people have been waiting up to seven hours. Election officials told the paper that delays are attributed to what may become a record voter turnout and a 10-page ballot. Similar situations have been reported in states like Virginia and South Carolina. In Virginia, the state's Board of Elections Secretary Donald Palmer said there were long lines in Richmond, Arlington, Virginia Beach, Roanoke and Hampton, along with Fairfax County. Same ol' situation: In Virginia, lines were long in several counties . 'It could go as late as 11 pm with the last of the localities where we receive results because some will go at least two or three hours past the deadline, which was seven, to get their results to the locality and then uploaded to our statewide database,' Palmer said. The board agreed after the polls closed to delay releasing results because it wanted to ensure voters aren't unduly influenced by preliminary results. A Twitter hashtag #stayinline is urging any voters waiting in queues to remain where they are. Americans turned out in droves today to exercise their constitutional right to vote in the conclusion of fierce campaigning on each side. Queues: In Florida, polling places that closed at 7pm remained open, as hundreds of people lined the streets in some areas, waiting to get in . But for many across the nation, the process of casting their vote for the future president was a slow, laborious process as long lines and those using social media while voting kept things moving at a glacial pace. Many younger voters wanted to show proof of their vote, posting their ballots to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram while in the booths, clogging up the flow of voters. In addition, voters in the tri-state area faced added difficulty casting their vote, as they continued to feel the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. Some in the outer boroughs used their phones for entirely different reasons – using flashlight apps to view the ballots, as their polling centers still haven’t regained power. Tight race: People in suburban Washington reportedly waited up to three hours to vote; here, voters queue in Alexandria at an elementary school .

Turnout appears to be high in many parts of the country, with long waits at some polling places as voters deliver their Election Day verdict. In suburban Washington, D.C., for instance, voters waited nearly three hours in line. Both Romney and President Obama need their supporters to show up in high numbers. A robust turnout among minorities would favor Obama, while Romney is looking for a strong showing among working-class white men. Several storm-ravaged areas of New York and New Jersey and several swing states are reporting heavy turnout, despite some areas lacking power. In battered Coney Island in Brooklyn, . the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) set up voter shuttles, giving . free rides to any residents who wanted to vote. According . to DNAInfo, many residents found out about the shuttle through . word-of-mouth, as much of the island remains without power more than a . week after Sandy.

In early exit polls, Latino voters have turned up in droves. According to a CNN exit poll, the demographic has accounted for around 10 percent of voters, up nine percent from the 2008 elections. President Obama has been a wide favorite among Latino voters, with around 87 percent saying they would vote for the incumbent. Though the wait by mid-afternoon was . nearly two hours, New Yorkers seemed generally good-natured about it. ‘I’m just doing my civic duty,’ one bundled-up East Village resident, . who requested not to be named, told MailOnline. He added that he hadn’t seen any lines at all in 2008, nor, in fact, in the past three elections. The . queue snaked around a local coffee shop and into the theatre; a coffee . shop employee was offering chilled voters a hot cup of coffee for only . one dollar. But not everyone affected by Sandy felt voting was in the cards this year. In hard-struck Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, Anthony Morrone said he's never missed a vote - until now. 'No time, no time to vote, too much to do,' Morrone, 76, told the Associated Press as he surveyed the exterior of his home: a pile of junked refrigerators, a car destroyed by flooding and a curbside mountain of waterlogged debris. This year, more than 32 million people voted before Election Day, either by mail or in person. In a number of states, including Iowa, Maryland and Montana, early voting was on track to far exceed totals from 2008.

Social media has also played a monumental part in this election cycle, with Facebook tracking responses of its users to see who voted, and where. The social network tracked more than 3.7million users who planned to cast their ballots today, either in person or via mail. According to Facebook buzz, President Obama was mentioned some 2.3million today on the social network, while former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney was talked about 1million times. In addition, young voters have been posting pictures of their filled-in ballots to Instagram and other social media sites. By this evening, there were more than 606,000 pictures of ballots uploaded to Instagram, with rumors flying of its illegality. Gothamist reported the act of posting your private ballot to the site is a misdemeanor in New York State. It is also illegal in Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Michigan, Texas, and Nevada. Some voters have experienced the consequences. According to AllthingsD, a man in North Carolina had his smartphone taken away after he took a photo of his completed ballot.","Long lines seen in many polling locations across the country - especially in Florida, where 70 per cent of precincts remain open .

It's one of the most devastating injuries in the history of sports, but it's not keeping Kevin Ware down. The 20-year-old Louisville basketball star was back on his feet today, just hours after the horrific leg fracture that had his right tibia breaking through the skin in a stomach-churning moment. 'I'll be back next season,' Ware tweeted to his fans from his bed at Methodist Hospital in Indiana on Monday. Earlier, he was pictured sporting a leg cast, a pair of crutches and a Final Four hat.

On the mend: Ware poses with Coach Rick Pitino, left, son Richard Pitino, right, and the NCAA regional championship trophy as they visited him in his hospital room on Monday morning . Doctors say that the surgery to repair the break was successful, and while his road to recovery is a daunting one, he should be able to play again. The Cardinals plan to leave for the Final Four in Atlanta on Wednesday night, and Louisville coach Rick Pitino said they expect to have Ware traveling with them. Ware is originally from New York City, but he moved to the Atlanta area before high school. Showing some leg: Ware posted a photo on Twitter of his surgically-repaired leg on Monday . 'He gets to go home, be with his family and be with us on the bench,' Pitino said. 'He's in very good spirits and anxious to get out of the hospital and get back with the guys. Through his Twitter account, Ware thanked his fans for their support and NCAA president Mark Emmert for visiting him in the hospital. He also posted a photo of his surgically-repaired leg as he laid in his hospital bed. Ware's girlfriend stayed with him overnight, and his mother and her husband arrived Monday. 'She just needed to see him this morning,' Pitino said. 'She was crying all night. Once she gave him a hug this morning, she was fine. Everything is good right now.' Ware's injury, which dominated social media on Sunday night, got the attention of everyone from famous athletes to celebrities. Television analyst Greg Anthony and even Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski called him Monday to see how Ware was doing. Senior athletic director Kevin Klein tweeted that Ware will be hospitalized until tomorrow, when he's expected to re-join his team as they travel to Atlanta for the semifinal game. After the injury, which took place in front of millions of horrified TV viewers, Ware valiantly told teammates: 'Don't worry about me, win this thing' after he landed badly from a jump to block a three-point shot during the Louisville-Duke game on Sunday night. Pitino and the Louisville team were in tears and some even vomited as Ware screamed in pain and writhed in agony on the court.

Inspiration: Despite unimaginable pain, Ware reportedly told teammates not to worry about him and to focus on winning the game . Trainers immediately covered the leg with a towel and . placed Ware on a backboard, then lifted him onto a stretcher. For television viewers, it was a terrifying sight that prompted many to express their sentiments on social media sites. CBS even stopped showing the replay, which was not seen inside Lucas Oil Stadium. But for Louisville players and coaches, it was far worse. Kevin Ware's break of the right tibia will go down in history as one of the most grisly sports injuries, but doctors agree that he will most likely be able to continue playing. Ware underwent successful surgery last night at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. In a two hour-procedure, doctors reset the broken bone and sewed up the wound from which the tibia had protruded. Fred Hina, Louisville's director of sports medicine, told USA Today that Ware's road to recovery will be a long one, but he should be able to play the game again. Dr Reed Estes, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said basketball players are prone to stress fractures in the tibia, the larger of the two leg bones, and that can weaken them. 'If these are not detected they can result in a full fracture, particularly if the landing mechanics are just right' after a jump, he said. Ware should be fine to play next season, he said. Dr Frederick Azar, head of the Campbell Clinic in Memphis, Tennessee, and a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, said Ware 'jumped pretty far horizontally and vertically, and he landed with a twist,' which puts so much torsion and stress on the bones they could have just snapped. He agreed with Estes' assessment that a stress fracture could have made Ware more prone to the injury. Guard Russ Smith said he didn't see . the play but heard the bone snap. And forward Chane Behanan, Ware's . closest friend, said the sight was almost unimaginable. Pitino, one of college basketball's top winners, thought he had seen just about everything in the sport until Ware's injury. Ware's teammates responded to the . shock of his loss by returning to the court with a vengeance. The second . half of the game saw Louisville dominate Duke - clobbering the Blue . Devils 85-63. School officials said doctors reset the bone and inserted a rod into the tibia during the two-hour procedure on Sunday night. A few hours later, his coach showed up at the hospital with a gift: The regional championship trophy. 'He was groggy, in good spirits,' said Rick Pitino. He added: 'He saw us win the trophy and was . crying and said it was all worthwhile. We didn't cut down the net, but I left him the . trophy.' Pitino said he and his son Richard, . who recruited Ware, spent the night in Indiana, along with the team's doctors. Louisville will play Wichita State in . the Final Four next weekend. The winner of that game plays for the NCAA . men's basketball championship. His teammates held up a jersey with Ware's name as they celebrated their resounding victory. After the game, Pitino . said: 'The bone’s 6 inches out of his leg and all he's yelling is, ""Win the game, win the game"" 'I've not seen that in my life. … Pretty special young man. He told NBC: 'We won this for him. We were all choked up with emotion for him. We’ll get him back to normal. We’ve got great doctors, great trainers. We talked about it every timeout, ""Get Kevin home.""' A haunting silence fell over Lucas Oil Stadium . in Indianapolis, Indiana, where the Elite Eight game was being played, . as fans waited for news of Ware's condition. The injury occurred with 6:33 left in . the first half as Duke's Tyler Thornton made a 3-pointer to get the . Blue Devils within 21-20. Ware tried to block the shot but landed on his feet awkwardly and his leg . buckled. The injury happened in front of the Louisville bench, and the Cardinals were overcome with emotion. Six inches of Ware's leg bone was left protruding after the injury and players including Russ Smith collapsed to the floor and were clearly crying as doctors attended to Ware. Sickened: Ware's teammates sobbed on the court after seeing their friend so badly injured during the game . Backing: After tweeting his support, legendary NFL quarterback texted Kevin Ware to offer 'anything he needed' In his shoes: Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, who's recovering from a knee injury he suffered in the NFL playoffs in January, tweeted: 'Prayers up for Kevin Ware, his teammates, & family' As . Ware was being loaded onto a stretcher, the Cardinals gathered at . midcourt until Pitino called them over, saying that Ware . wanted to talk to them before he left. An outpouring of support has emerged for the injured Louisville guard, including from fellow athletes and celebrities. Former . Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, who famously sustained a . broken leg during a Monday Night Football game against the New York . Giants, tweeted, 'Watching Duke/ Louisville my heart goes out to Kevin . Ware.' Pitino wiped away his eyes as Ware was wheeled out, as did several of the Louisville players. If anyone knows what . Ware is going through, it's Theismann, whose career was finished when . he was brought down by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, and his knee . drove into his lower leg bones. Theismann told NFL AM that he had texted Ware to offer 'anything he needed.' He said: 'The emotional part of it is . where I can maybe help walk him through it because I can tell him . everything that he's going to feel, I can tell him everything that he's . going to go through emotionally.' Current Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, who's recovering from a knee injury he suffered in the NFL playoffs in January, tweeted: 'Prayers up for Kevin Ware, his teammates, & family.' He also got personal shout-outs from NBA stars like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. Today show anchor Matt Lauer posted: 'Sounds like Kevin Ware's surgery went well.

Nissan and Downing Street said the £420million investment in the pollution-free car will support more than 2,000 jobs in the UK automotive industry - including more than 500 employed directly at Nissan which currently employs 6,100. Turning over a new LEAF: Nissan's latest electric car will be built at its Sunderland factory, creating 2,000 jobs . Production of the new Nissan LEAF at the Japanese car-giant's record-breaking Sunderland factory was hailed as a huge boost to the UK economy . Until now the car has only been built in Japan and the USA. But the new and improved second-generation LEAF - with a range of 123 miles and the ability to recharge in half the time. The zero-emissions plug-in electric car is powered by advanced lithium-ion batteries manufactured in Nissan’s new UK Battery Plant and costs from around £20,000 including the £5,000 taxpayer subsidy. This historic launch event comes as Nissan Sunderland Plant celebrates making more than seven million vehicles since its opening in 1986. Last year alone it produced 510,572 vehicles and so became the first UK car factory ever to make more than half a million cars in one year. David Cameron said plans to create the first electric cars in Britain will create 2,000 jobs in the UK . Ahead of his visit today (THURS) Mr Cameron said: ‘Nissan’s record breaking year last year is a success story for UK volume car manufacturing and demonstrates how our automotive industry is competing and thriving in the global race. ‘I warmly welcome the production of the new electric LEAF model and battery plant at Sunderland. ‘This £420 million investment, backed by Government, is supporting over 2,000 jobs in our automotive sector including more than 500 at Nissan in Sunderland, helping people in the area who want to work hard and get on.’ He said the Government had committed £400million to make the UK ‘a leading market for ultra low carbon vehicles.’ He added: ‘Nissan’s announcement shows the confidence the company has in the skills-base and the business environment in the UK and that the UK is open for business.’ Nissan’s executive vice president Andy Palmer said: ‘The Nissan LEAF is our most technically advanced car yet and the launch of this new model, built along with its batteries in Sunderland, is a huge boost not only for the plant but for British manufacturing.’ More than 55,000 first-generation Nissan LEAFs have been built.","Plant will help build Japanese car maker's LEAF model .

A convicted rapist and cult leader known as Black Jesus, who was accused of murdering three girls and then eating their flesh and drinking their blood, has escaped from jail with 48 other prisoners. A huge manhunt is underway in Papua New Guinea's jungles for Stephen Tari and the other inmates, who broke out of prison in Madang in the north of the country while a guard changed shift. Police have warned that some of the escapees are very dangerous and stressed officers are working 'around the clock' to catch them. 'Black Jesus': Notorious cult leader Stephen Tari after he was captured in Papua New Guinea in 2007 . Tari, 40, a failed Bible class student, called himself Black Jesus as he travelled through the highland jungles in 2006, gathering thousands of disciples who moved with him, following his instructions to increase his 'flock'. But he was also accused of raping three young girls, murdering them and then drinking their blood and eating their flesh. Villagers eventually captured him in March 2007, beat him into unconsciousness, tied him up and handed him over to police. In 2010 he was convicted of four counts of rape but was not charged with murder due to lack of evidence,  despite protests by the relatives of three dead girls. Now the enigmatic figure, who wore long white robes as he stood on a rock in a jungle clearing and preached his own gospel to his disciples, has sparked fears that he plans to look for new followers with his escape. 'The guard left his tower,' PNG Correction Service’s spokesman Richard Mandui told Radio Australia today. Capture: The feared Tari was beaten by villagers and tied up before being handed over to the police . 'While the shift was taking place, the detainees used a tool to cut through a fence and they left for freedom.' 'We’re working around the clock to find Stephen Tari and the other men,' said Madang’s Acting Provincial Police Commander Inspector Jacob Bando. During his days of freedom he gathered more than six thousand disciples by telling them they would recieve gifts from heaven if they followed him. Followers: Tari gathered more than six thousand disciples with his preaching in the jungles (library image) But jungle communities were horrified to be told that Stephen Tari had sacrificed three young women, drinking their blood and eating their flesh as part of his bizarre religious ceremonies. In one case, a mother who had fallen under his influence, drank her daughter’s blood, according to relatives who the Daily Mail spoke to at the time. He gradually became a figure of fear. Tari was eventually captured in the small village of Matapi, a seven-hour walk from the nearest road. Church pastor Paul Makura said it had been difficult for police to catch Tari as he never stayed for long in one place and was always warned by his disciples when police were in the area. When he turned up in Matapi villa, frightened villagers pounced on him while he was sleeping in a hut and tied him up. Messages were passed through villages until one man with a mobile phone was able to get a call to police in the town of Madang. Heavily-armed officers found the badly-beaten Tari tied to a makeshift stretcher when they arrived in the village. There was no sign of Black Jesus’ bow-and-arrow bodyguards who on an earlier occasion when Tari escaped had engaged in a fight to the death with police. Now police are hoping that with the notorious Black Jesus on the run once again they will be able to recapture him before he gets another cult up and running .","Stephen Tari among inmates who escaped while a guard changed shift .

Ware admitted to a gaggle of reporters at the university that he did not know Louisville had gone on to win the game until he woke up on Monday morning, with the NCAA trophy by his side. His eyes watered as ESPN's Rece Davis asked him what that moment meant to him. With tears streaming down his face, Ware told Davis: 'It meant everything to me. They went out there and did that for me.' 'Words can’t explain. I love those guys to death. I wouldn’t trade them in for the world.Those are the brothers I never had.

Ware told reporters during a press conference that he had no prior problems with his leg before the horrific injury, which forced six inches of his leg bone to break through his skin.

'Luke said his words, and I just kept repeating, ""y'all gotta go win this game. I'm fine."" It really helped the team.'

He awoke the next morning to discover he had become an overnight sensation, and the afterglow hasn't waned. His condition and progress have been featured every day on the major networks, the Internet and especially social media.

The Louisville guard said he has even heard from the Rev Jesse Jackson and Michelle Obama. For the soft-spoken Ware, the support and media attention has meant more interviews than he ever imagined. 'I had no idea I would get this kind of attention,' he said. 'I'm one of those guys who just likes to play basketball. But the injury opened up a lot of peoples' eyes and I really appreciate all the support. It really means a lot.' He said that even though he will be on the bench for the game on Saturday, he hopes he can contribute to another Louisville victory. He said: 'I don't have to tell them anything.

A doctor on one of France's most popular reality television shows has committed suicide just over a week after one of the contestants died of a heart attack. Thierry Costa killed himself in Cambodia, the setting of Koh-Lanta, a French version of Survivor, which was halted last week following the death of contestant Gérald Babin, the TF1 television channel has said. Costa's suicide note, published in full on TV1's website, said the media had made 'unfair accusations and assumptions' about his treatment of Babin. Suicide: Doctor Thierry Costa has killed himself just over a week after one of the contestants on one of France's most popular reality television shows died of a heart attack . Some media outlets had carried reports criticising the amount of time it took for anyone to treat Babin, 25, after his collapse. 'In the past few days my name has been tarnished in the media,' Dr Costa wrote in the note which was also shown on television news reports. According to a translation in The Times, Dr Costa said: 'In the 20 years since I took up medicine, I have always tried to work hard with respect for my patients, love of medicine and following the Hippocratic oath. 'I have the feeling today that all these efforts have been destroyed by untrue articles. 'I would never dare look anyone in the eye again in France without wondering if they were full of distrust for me. 'I am certain that I treated Gerald in a respectable manner, as a patient and not as a contestant.' Tragic: Gérald Babin died of a heart attack after falling ill during a tug-of-war task with other contestants on the programme . TF1 cited a statement from the show's producers Adventure Line Productions (ALP), that Costa's suicide should 'encourage those who accuse and comment indiscriminately to exercise responsibility'. Costa, who specialized in emergency medicine, had spent four seasons on France's longest-running reality show in which candidates must survive on an uninhabited island and compete in a series of challenges. Prosecutors in the Paris suburb of Creteil launched a preliminary investigation into Babin's death last week. Koh-Lanta was filming its 16th season on a Cambodian island when Gérald Babin fell ill during a tug-of-war task with other contestants. The 25-year-old was airlifted to a nearby hospital but suffered a series of heart attacks on the way and was later pronounced dead. The tragic incident came at the very start of a planned five-month stay on the island of Koh Rong. Contestants had jumped from a boat and were taking part in a tug-of-war contest when Mr Babin started to complain about cramps in his arms. Doctors examined him on the set and decided he should be taken to hospital on the mainland town of Sihanoukville. After he suffered from multiple cardiac arrests on the helicopter journey, hospital doctors were unable to save his life. Adventure Line Productions, which produces the programme, said that Mr Babin had undergone a medical examination before being accepted as a contestant. Popular: Koh-Lanta has been running on TF1 since 2001, and averaged 7.4million viewers in its latest season . Broadcaster TF1 said in a statement: 'The whole team from ALP and TF1, plus [presenter] Denis Brogniart, are devastated and share in the deep sadness of Gérald's family. 'All their thoughts are with his parents, sister, wife and friends.' The companies immediately decided to suspend filming and cancel the show's current season, and the cast and crew have now returned to France.

The creators of what was one of the world's most successful social networks have unveiled their radical new plans for what they believe represents the future of social media. And it's called a bar. Michael and Xochi Birch were major players in the development of the online social networking phenomenon, but their latest project has definitely gone offline. The husband and wife team were the founders of the Bebo website, a rival to Facebook, which at its peak was the biggest social networking website in the UK and the third most popular in the world. The couple netted a staggering £850m when they sold the site to AOL in 2008 after which its popularity waned. Back to the future: Bebo Founder Michael Birch at his new San Fransisco members-only club The Battery . Now after various successful endeavours including Pinterest the scrapbooking site and a not-for-profit water charity website, they have turned their attention back to social networking, albiet with more than a little nod to the past. The Battery in San Fransisco was inspired by the new wave of London members' clubs founded from about 1980 onwards such as the Groucho, Soho House and The Hospital Club. The Birches believe they have stumbled on a niche market, as while San Fransisco is awash with fine restaurants there are absolutely no members clubs. They feel that by making the club members-only it will have the potential to create real-word friendships in a similar way to how social websites do online. The Birches sold Bebo to AOL for $850m . Unlike a traditional bar or pub, it will mean chance encounters between for example IT entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and other businessmen and women from across the vibrant city, are more likely to be repeated. Mr Birch told the Financial Times: 'Despite being an incredibly advanced city entrepreneuriallyand in every other way, San Fransisco is quite behind socially. 'What we want to do is have a diversity - we want tech to be the minority, not the majority. The normal topic of conversations should not start with your new app.' The Battery, which is nearing completion after almost five years in development, is a 60,000sq ft, four storey building on the edge of the city's financial district. Designers have tried to create a care-free, light-hearted space with five bars, a dining area and a spa room. Playful touches are everywhere: One of the bars has ping pong tables while the frosted floor to the glass elevator turns clear when it descends. Mr Birch added: 'Anything childish is my idea. One rule we set ourselves since selling{Bebo} is that we shouldn't do anything in life that we didn't think was going to be fun.'","Michael and Xochi Birch have built a members-only club in San Fransisco .

Accused: Kremlin accused Laura Shatto, right, of beating little Max, left, to death in January . On the call, Shatto says she's not . sure what happened, that she left Max playing outside while she went to . use the bathroom in her home near Odessa. She later told the operator her son was autistic, self-injurious and on medication. The woman begins to weep as she . unsuccessfully tries to revive him.

The woman tells the operator that her . adoptive son is . 'starting to smell like he’s pooping himself.’ Throughout the conversation, the operator reminds Shatto to check that the boy's airways are clear and check for the pulse. While on the call with the 911 . operator, Max's younger half-brother, who was also adopted by the Shattos from Russia, could be heard crying hysterically and shrieking . in the background. Several times Mrs  Shatto says, 'Mama's not hurting him,, mama's trying to help.' As time goes on Laura Shatto asks, 'Where are they?' referring to EMS . personnel, and pleads through apparent sobs to the operator, 'Please, I . need help.'

Parents: The boy's adoptive parents denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made .

Last week, an autopsy report . revealed the the three-year-old boy had more than 30 bruises and other . marks on his body as well as signs that he was routinely injured by . accident. Russian officials have expressed disbelief at the decision not to charge the Shattos. They blame the Shattos for the boy's death, which has become the latest flashpoint in a debate over American adoptions of Russian children. The autopsy report released to the Odessa American . suggests that the Shattos were struggling to care for Max due to his . behavioral problems and his tendency to hurt himself. The Shattos have . declined to comment publicly about the boy's death. The boy, born Maxim Kuzmin, died Jan. 21 after Laura Shatto found him unresponsive outside their home in Gardendale, Texas. A medical examiner's investigator . wrote in the report that she found abrasions, scrapes and bruises from . head to toe on Max's body.

Laura Shatto . reported that three days before his death, Max nearly choked on a cooked . carrot.

'The injuries on the child were not . consistent with abuse,' Bland said this month. 'They were, instead, . consistent with the previously diagnosed behavioral disorder.' He said Max likely suffered the fatal . injuries during 10 minutes when he was playing outside and Laura Shatto . was in the bathroom.

Sad: The little boy, pictured right, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 21 . The lack of charges against the . Shatto family 'raises serious questions,' Konstantin Dolgov, a Foreign . Ministry official, told a state-controlled television channel last week. 'It turns out that the child died and his adoptive parents are in no . way guilty of this. Moreover, they are trying to persuade us that the . boy's lethal injuries were inflicted by himself.' The family's attorney, Michael J.

Kathleen Stimon, a school librarian in New Hampshire, has been married to Bruce Stimon, 47, for 22 years . ‘I told him I didn't . think I could be married to him anymore, that I wanted a divorce,’ she told ABC's 20/20. Angered by his wife's response, Bruce Stimon began to terrorize her via the internet. ‘He shut off the utilities going in our house... my house, and our child's house,’ she said. ‘He took over anything he could . online... my Facebook, my eBay, my PayPal. I thought I was safe because . he was in prison. I didn't think he was capable of doing anything . during that time.’ She also received . another unwanted surprise, a $50,000 bills for charges including . travel to see Hicks and gifts he gave Hicks during their romance - . flowers, chocolates, lingerie and an iPhone he used to track Soraida . Hicks' every move. Bruce Stimon is serving a seven-year sentence for posting a sex tape of his ex-girlfriend, Soraida Hicks, and advertising her as an escort . Bruce Stimon was sentenced to three years in January for stalking, identity theft and extortion. He sent nude photographs of Hicks to her co-workers and her daughter's friends and the harassment meant she lost her job in a bank and was forced her to change her name. Kathleen Stimon says she was horrified when she found out about her husband's affair and his reign of cyber terror on Soraida Hicks. ‘The things he did to her, hour and hours of plotting and planning, were very devious, very ugly,’ she said. ‘And when you involve somebody's child, I mean, it's the lowest thing you do. It's just despicable.’ Soraida Hicks, 32, says didn't know Stimon was married when he harassed her. She is now suing him for $20 million after he posted photographs of her and her teenage daughter onto prostitution websites and then directed men to her home. She told 20/20 that she is still afraid of what he might do to her. 'I'm afraid that he's going to pay someone to kill me,' Hicks said. Soraida Hicks and her daughter Pam were subjected to almost a year of cyber attacks and harassment by Hicks' ex-boyfriend Bruce Stimon . Arlington resident Hicks, met Stimon on a plane traveling from Boston to Washington in the fall of 2011. The two started up a long-distance . relationship and Stimon began to buy Hicks expensive gifts, including an . iPhone which he paid for on his own family plan. However, the systematic abuse began when Stimon used the iPhone as a way to gain access to Hicks' emails and calls and began to send offensive messages from her number. 'He sent a message to people saying that I have an STD,' said Hicks, who quickly figured out that it was Stimon and then ended the relationship. However, in January 2012, the level of Stimon's intrusion into her life was revealed when she learned he had 'created a web site advertising her services as a prostitute according to the lawsuit filed. Stimon had posted Hicks' name, address and explicit photographs and listed her work supervisor as her point of contact. Stimon is also alleged to have uploaded online pornographic films he had made of the two without Hicks' knowledge. Because of the cyber attack, men began to call her boss at the bank asking if she was available as a prostitute and because of this she was subsequently fired. And then in a shocking escalation, Stimon sent a video of Hicks and himself to all of her daughter's friends Twitter accounts. One of the website on which Stimson uploaded details of Hicks and her daughter Pam - offering their services as prostitutes and directing men to their address in Arlington . 'It was devastating,' Pam said. 'I would go into the bathroom stall and just cry and would come back to class and act like everything was okay.' 'Everyone was asking me, 'oh, is your mom a porn star?' And I am like, no.' Then, Stimon allegedly used porn sites to list 'mother and daughter' for sex and through a text messaging system sent potential clients to the women's home. Around 60 men arrived looking for sex, but Arlington Police said that since Stimon was operating his vicious scheme from Boston, it was out of their jurisdiction. 'From January to probably about March, we were just trying to compile information and figure out what was going on,' said Detective Angela Comer of the Arlington County Police Department. 'The commonwealth attorneys, the tactical unit, just about every unit in our department had a hand on this case.'

The jury that convicted Richard Beasley of murder last month recommended that he face execution and Judge Lynne Callahan chose not to reduce the sentence this morning to life in prison, uttering under her breath as the killer left the court room 'I think I'm going to be sick.' Beasley, 53, was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to use the promise of jobs on a southeast Ohio farm to lure the men to their deaths. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Killer: Richard Beasley, pictured in court today, insisted 'I killed nobody' as he was sentenced to death in the killings of three down-and-out men lured by bogus job offers posted on Craigslist . Three men were killed, and a fourth who was wounded testified at Beasley's trial. The judge read the three death sentences in a hushed courtroom crowded with victims' relatives, some of them holding back tears, Beasley skipped the chance to speak to the judge before the sentencing. He asked to speak later, but the judge said that was his chance, and he passed on it. He listened to the verdict with his head on his chest, sitting in a wheelchair he uses for back pain. Sick: Judge Lynne Callahan, pictured right, chose not to reduce Beasley's sentence to life in prison, uttering under her breath as the killer, left, exited the court room 'I think I'm going to be sick' Beasley, however, was allowed to make a brief statement before being sentenced on additional counts. He told the court, 'I killed nobody. To the families, I'm sorry. ... I will continue to pray for you.' As family members left the courtroom, one of them was overheard to say to Beasley, 'Your words mean nothing.' Beasley wore a red and white striped prison jumpsuit and was seated in a wheelchair during the proceeding. Beasley's co-defendant, who was 16 at the time of the crimes, was too young to face the death penalty.

Norfolk, Va.; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon. All were looking for a . fresh start in life, prosecutors said repeatedly during the trial. The . survivor, Scott Davis, now 49, testified that he heard the click of a . gun as he walked in front of Beasley at the reputed job site. Davis, who . was shot in an arm, knocked the weapon aside, fled into the woods and . tipped police. Beasley, who returned to Ohio from .

'I always felt there was much more than he told me,' she said. As she testified, Beasley slumped forward, his chin on his chest and his right hand covering his eyes. The defense also called a psychologist, John Fabian, who testified that Beasley suffers from depression, alcohol abuse, low self-esteem and a feeling of isolation, all possible results of a troubled, abusive childhood.

Mrs Hills, who is in her seventies, said the 'vortex' gust left the scene outside her home looking like a 'warzone'. She now fears for her safety at the house in Old Windsor, Berkshire - which is under Heathrow's flightpath. Describing the incident - which happened at about 6pm - the retired concert pianist said: 'I heard this huge explosion and thought it was a clap of thunder. 'Then a neighbour came rushing over and said 'did you know there is a hole in your roof?'' Mrs Hills, who called the fire brigade, added: 'They were marvellous and helped clear away the worst of the debris. It looked like a war zone before they arrived. This has left me feeling frightened and alone.' Fears: She said the incident, in Old Windsor, Berkshire, has left her feeling 'frightened and alone' They also put up a cordon around the front of the house to keep people safe. Neighbour Peter Green said: 'Our houses are semi-detached so I must have been about 15 yards away from where it happened. 'I heard it clearly in my study. It sounded like a whoosh, then a loud bang and clattering as tiles scattered everywhere.' Wingtip vortices are rotating air left behind by a wing as it generates lift. Their intensity or strength depends on aircraft's size, speed and whether it has its flaps or landing gear down. They cause 'wake turbulence' for other aircraft and, in rare cases, can damage buildings. Mr Green - who is himself an airline pilot - initially thought the damage had been caused by ice from an incoming plane. But an investigation by airport operator BAA concluded the damage had not be caused by a solid object but by a 'wave of vortex.' That is a gust of swirling air that can follow an aircraft and in rare instances cause this sort of damage. A spokesman for BAA said an assessor had been to Mrs Hills' house and the company will now send men around to replace her damaged roof. He said: 'It is rare, but we have a policy of carrying out repairs where this has happened to people.' Mrs Hills said: 'BAA have acted honourably and I'm very pleased at their quick response.' It is not known which plane was responsible or at what height it was flying.

A 65-year-old man has been arrested by detectives investigating allegations that emerged after the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal. The man was held in Somerset this morning on suspicion of sexual offences, Scotland Yard said. Allegations against him are not linked to Savile, the force confirmed. The man is the twelfth person to be arrested under Operation Yewtree, the national investigation prompted by allegations against the disgraced television presenter. Yesterday, another of the men arrested under Yewtree was charged with five offences. Driver David Smith is accused of two counts of indecent assault, two of gross indecency and one of buggery in 1984, the Crown Prosecution Service said. He is the first person to be charged as part of the investigation. Smith, 66, from Lewisham in south east London, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 8. All of the counts relate to one alleged victim. Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said yesterday: 'The CPS has carefully considered the evidence gathered as part of Operation Yewtree in relation to David Smith, who was employed as a driver at the time of the allegations. 'The CPS received a file of evidence on December 21 2012. Further enquiries were necessary and the result of those enquiries was received by the CPS on March 18. 'We have concluded, in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and that it is in the public interest for David Smith to be charged with five offences.' The charges are two counts of indecent assault on a boy under 14 between June 1 and July 21 1984; two counts of gross indecency with a boy under 14 between the same dates and sexual assault of a boy under 16 between July 1 and 21 1984. BBC News reported that Smith had worked as a driver for the broadcaster and possibly other employers. But a BBC press office spokesman said she was unable to confirm whether he had been employed by the organisation, as the Corporation's records do not go back as far as 1984. Wilfred De¿ath who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused police of being 'over-zealous' Last month an 82-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences as part of the Jimmy Savile investigation. A Scotland Yard spokesman said that the man, who has not been named, was interviewed under . caution on November 29 last year, five days after a search warrant was . executed at an address in Berkshire. Amid claims of a celebrity witch-hunt, there has been growing speculation that Freddie Starr could soon be told that he, too, will not be charged . He has been given police bail until May. Earlier this week the Mail revealed that as few as three of the men arrested by Scotland Yard over suspected sex offences in the Savile case are likely to be charged. Details of the small number of Yewtree prosecutions emerged a day after a former BBC producer was released without charge following his arrest over an alleged sex assault in 1965. Wilfred De’ath, 75, who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused police of being ‘over-zealous’ because they had failed ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign of terror while he was still alive. Amid claims of a celebrity witch-hunt, there has been growing speculation that Freddie Starr could soon be told that he, too, will not be charged. The 70-year-old entertainer was arrested in November over claims he attempted to grope a 14-year-old girl in Jimmy Savile’s BBC changing room in 1974. A woman called Karin Ward claimed Starr had had a ‘very bad attack of wandering hands’ with her nearly 40 year ago. He vehemently denied her claims. Last month a Metropolitan Police report said Savile had abused adults and children across the country over more than five decades. The NSPCC said Savile, who was 84 when he died, had been one of the most prolific sex offenders in its 129-year history.

The disgraced Rutgers men's basketball coach - who was fired after a video emerged of him hitting players with basketballs and gay slurs - has said he is an 'embarrassment to his family.' Mike Rice was fired this morning, just one day after massive public outcry surrounding a video that showed him pushing, kicking and spewing homophobic remarks at his players. The university said in a statement today: 'Based upon recently revealed information and a review of previously discovered issues, Rutgers has terminated the contract of Mike Rice.' Scroll down for video . Boiling Rice: The video shows several moments when Rice angrily pushed, shoved and grabbed his players during practices . Anger: In this clip, Rice, in white, is seen getting into the face of one of the Rutgers players . Tim Pernetti, the Rutgers athletic . director - who yesterday defended his decision to suspend and not fire Rice - has admitted that he made the wrong move. Pernetti said: 'I am responsible for . the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice. 'Dismissal and . corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the . best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong.' He added: 'Moving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community.' Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move . Speaking to WABC-TV outside his home today, Rice said there is 'no excuse' for his behavior in the video, and apologized for his actions. He told the station: I've let so many people down, my players, my administration, Rutgers University, the fans, my family - who's sitting in their house, just huddled around because of the fact that their father was an embarrassment to them. It's troubling, but I hope at some time, maybe I'll try and explain it. 'But right now, there's no explanation for what's on those films, because there's no excuse for it. I was wrong. And I want to tell everybody who's believed in me that I'm deeply sorry for the pain and the hardship that I've caused.' Facing the media: Rice spoke to reporters outside his New Jersey home on Wednesday after it was learned that he had been fired . Media: A reporter stands near the front door of the home of the former Rutgers coach in Little Silver, New Jersey . Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!' The clip, obtained and released by ESPN yesterday, shows a number of disturbing and violent actions taken by Rice toward his players during team practices. At one point on the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You’re a f***ing f****t!' And his rants were not just limited to the verbal. The footage shows Rice grabbing, kicking and shoving players - and even hurling basketballs at them. Fired: Rice was let go by Rutgers amid a public outcry surrounding the release of the video yesterday . The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012. Murdock, a former college standout . who played with teams like the Utah Jazz and . New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, was hired by Rutgers in 2010 as director . of player development. He told ESPN that it wasn't long before he reported Rice's aggressive behavior to Pernetti. But Rice was not disciplined until Murdock showed him the footage in November. A month later, Rice was suspended for three games without pay and fined $50,000 for what was described as inappropriate behavior and language. Rice returned to his duties as head coach in a game on January 2 against Syracuse. Pernetti said in an interview with . ESPN yesterday that he issued the suspension and the fine after he was shown the . tape and conducted an investigation into the matter. He said that Rice was penalized appropriately for a 'first offense.' Pernetti nor director of athletic communications Kevin Lorincz returned messages from MailOnline for comment. When asked about the suspension at the time, Pernetti said: 'I was made aware of some things within the last couple of weeks. We commenced a thorough, lengthy and fair investigation and this was the result of that investigation. 'There was obviously some things that are not to the Rutgers' standard that we evaluated and decided upon.' Whistleblower: The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012 . Criticism: As the clip has spread, it has drawn a rebuke from many on social media, including NBA superstar LeBron James . In an interview with WFAN, Pernetti said . university president Robert Barchi saw the tape and concurred with his . actions against Rice. After ESPN aired the videotape yesterday, a flood of anger swirled on social media with many lambasting Rutgers, including NBA superstar LeBron James and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie. After the decision was announced today, Gov Christie posted a series of tweets supporting the decision to fire Rice. He said: 'It was the right & necessary action to take in light of the conduct displayed on the videotape.' Speaking out: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said in a series of Twitter posts that he supported Rutgers' decision to remove Rice . Murdock stayed with the team for two years until July 2012, when his contract was not renewed. Murdock claims he was fired after he reported Rice’s antics, a claim Pernetti denies. His attorney Raj Gadhok told ESPN: 'Mr Murdock was terminated for having complained of and reported illegal conduct by Mike Rice. As a result, his employment was terminated by Rutgers University. 'That’s unlawful in the state of New Jersey and Eric intends to pursue legal action for his wrongful termination, which he university and its representatives had been aware of for some time now.' When push comes to shove: Pernetti insisted yesterday that he issued an 'appropriate' suspension after he was shown the tape and conducted an investigation into the matter .","Coach Mike Rice was fired by the university after a video was released that showed him pushing, kicking and spewing homophobic remarks at players .

Not everyone is a naturally gifted musician - but a new invention means you no longer need to be to play a note-perfect solo on the violin. Technology lecturer Dylan Menzies has created the O-Bow, which translates data from an optical sensor and keyboard into violin music. The optical flow sensor monitors the speed and angle of a bow when it is moved across indented grooves on the top of it - much like drawing a bow across an actual violin. Scroll down to watch the video . Hitting the right notes: The O-Bow has an optical flow sensor which is 'played' with a real violin bow while a keyboard is used to choose the notes . Pitch perfect: O-Bow inventor Dylan Menzies believes that experienced keyboard players could learn how to use his system within a few minutes . A keyboard connected to the sensor is used to play the notes and choose the pitch of the music. Combined, this means the user can create music that sounds just like a violin is being played - without the need for years of practice. Multi-talented: Dylan Menzies is a technology lecturer at De Montford University but also a passionate keyboard and sax player . Mr Menzies, who is a lecturer at De Montfort University, told Wired.co.uk: 'I at one time had an obsession with Sibelius' Violin Concerto, and realised I was never going to be able to play something like that on a real violin - I'm a keyboard/sax player. 'That got me thinking about why a violin is hard, and could it be easier but still expressive? I was aware of various commercial and research devices, but nothing seemed to address the problem of electronic bowing as an instrument in its own right, rather than an effect or add-on.' The software can be used to create a . variety of sounds including ringing - the term given to describe the . sound made when a bow is removed part way through playing. It can also produce vibrato, which is a pulsating technique created by shaking the wrist. The lecturer believes a good keyboard player can learn how to use his system in just a few minutes. He . added: 'A week of practicing, you can sound pretty good. I don't think I . have mastered it yet; there is a lot of potential, even for expression . that is impossible on a real stringed instrument.' Mr Menzies has produced five prototypes and may eventually bring the instrument to market.

But these are three boats made entirely from salvaged junk - including plywood, motors and bedding. After six months of gathering materials and shipping them to Slovenia, a team of artists and performers built the boats and set sail to attend the prestigious Venice Biennale art show, even though they hadn't been invited. Their aim was to show that anything could be built even if you only had the idea. The Swimming Cities of Serenissima project was the idea of Callie Curry, better known as the Brooklyn-based street artist Swoon. Street artist Swoon led a team who built three 'floating sculptures' of of junk and sailed them into the prestigious Venice Biennale . The ships of scraps, photographed by Tod Seelie, were built in Slovenia before the crews embarked on the voyage to Venice . After arriving in Venice the group, made of puppeteers, musicians and performers, spent a fortnight entertaining crowds gathered for the Biennale . Each collaborator was picked for their skills, including carpentry, engineering and performance . Brooklyn-based artist Swoon came up with the idea for the Swimming Cities trips, starting with ventures down the Hudson and Mississippi rivers before tackling the trip to Venice . Swoon, whose work is on show at the . Museum of Modern Art in New York, had previously led teams of friends . and collaborators down the Hudson and Mississippi Rivers on 'floating . sculptures' made out of discarded junk, including wood, bedding and car . parts. But the project to sail into the . Venice Biennale show was nearly scuppered by Slovenian . customs officials who were not sure whether to believe that 40ft . containers filled with junk were going to be turned into art rather than . dumped on the country's shores. After getting their containers back, the team of 30 artists, musicians and performers had enough material to build two rafts and planned to make a third out of what they could salvage in Slovenia. The scavenging began in December 2008, six months before the ships were ready to set sail. Each crew member was picked for their skills, including carpentry and engineering. Anyone who joined the team had to follow the 'sack of potatoes' rule and bring equivalent food supplies on board. They turned discarded barrels, scraps found in skips, crates and sheets of plywood into boats which made the 130-mile voyage to Venice, with plenty of stops for scavenging. The rafts were powered by modified Mercedes car motors that ran on biofuel and had long-tail propellers. The Swimming Cities of Serinissima arrived in Venice for the Biennale without an invitation . It was all hands on deck for the Swimming Cities crew, who salvaged every piece of the boat . Anyone who wanted to the join the crew had to follow the 'sack of potatoes' rule and bring supplies .

They 'docked' for a fortnight of street performances, puppetry and music and showed off a 'cabinet of curiosities' made of objects they found on their journey. Swoon told Flavorwire that the 'vilest and strangest thing to come aboard has been a dog pelt'. She said: 'We’ve had kindergartners singing to us, families cooking us dinners that they haul to the docks in ten-gallon buckets, and amazing old ladies bringing lace for our show and fixing our sewing machine. The Venice trip was almost held up by Slovenian customs officials who weren't convinced at first that the 40ft containers full of junk were going to be turned into art . Everything from car parts to plywood and bedding became part of the boats . The crew's journey from Slovenia to Venice made frequent stops for gathering materials . 'This level of human connection and support has never happened in any of my other artistic projects, and it is so touching.' On their Tumblr site, the team said: 'To the real life crew, the boats were a place of refuge – both a home and a way of moving through the world. 'To those who encounter the boats for the first time, they were a reminder that anything that can be imagined can be built.'

Only when one of the most senior church leaders in North East England applied some pressure did the newly-appointed Sunderland boss finally issue a statement denying he was a fascist. For three days he had steadfastly refused. For three days both Paolo Di Canio and his employers at Sunderland had responded to anyone who dared question the Italian's appointment with a misguided mixture of anger and hostility. When David Miliband resigned as the football club board's vice-chairman on Sunday night, citing Di Canio's 'past political statements', Sunderland failed to even mention the departure of the ex-foreign secretary in the statement that amounted to their first bungled attempt to bury the controversy. Scroll down for video and to read the Dean of Durham's full letter to Paolo Di Canio . Plea: The Dean of Durham (right) called on Paolo Di Canio (left) to distance himself from far-right tendencies . When journalists asked their . questions at his official unveiling at the club's training ground on . Tuesday, Di Canio called time on a heated exchange by rising from his . seat and walking out. When the former Swindon manager was . then asked, in a separate media briefing, if he would meet members of . the Durham Miners' Association who have been so offended by his . politics, his response was: 'Why should I?' Even when the leader of Sunderland . City Council said a lack of clarification could result in a serious . fracture in their relationship with the club, there appeared to be a . distinct lack of action. But when the Dean of Durham joined . the chorus of disapproval by writing an emotional open letter to Di . Canio yesterday, the 44-year-old finally attempted to draw a line under . the issue with a statement on the Sunderland website. He said: 'I have clearly stated that I . do not wish to speak about matters other than football; however, I have . been deeply hurt by the attacks on the football club. 'This is a historic, proud and . ethical club and to read and to hear some of the vicious and personal . accusations is painful. I am an honest man, my values and principles . come from my family and my upbringing. Controversial: Do Canio's appointment has caused uproar among fans and those opposed to fascism . 'I feel that I should not have to . continually justify myself to people who do not understand this, however . I will say one thing only - I am not the man that some people like to . portray. 'I am not political, I do not . affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not . support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone. 'I am a football man and this and my family are my focus. Now I will speak only of football.' 'I am not political, I do not affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone. I am a football man and this and my family are my focus. Now I will speak only of football' Paolo Di Canio, Sunderland manager . Despite his protestations, there is . strong evidence linking Di Canio to fascism, but until yesterday the . Italian had steadfastly refused to be drawn on his political beliefs. But the letter from the Very Reverend . Michael Sadgrove proved impossible to dismiss. A Sunderland supporter, . the Dean wrote of how Di Canio's appointment 'raises very difficult . questions'. He said he was 'the child of a Jewish . war refugee who got out of Germany and came to Britain just in time', . some of whose 'family and friends perished in the Nazi death camps... So . I find your self-confessed fascism deeply troubling. 'Fascism was nearly . the undoing of the world,' he added. 'Mussolini, who you say has been deeply misunderstood, openly colluded with it.' He pointed out that the North East . has been 'fertile ground' in which the British National Party has sown . 'the seeds of its pernicious and poisonous doctrine' and warned: 'Unless . you clearly renounce fascism in all its manifestations, you will be . associated with these toxic far-right tendencies we have seen too much . of in this region.' Down to work: Di Canio took charge of his first training session at Sunderland today . Paul Watson, the leader of Sunderland City Council and a Labour member, had spoken on Tuesday. 'Sunderland AFC is a private business and we wouldn't be dictating to them about their morals and ethics,' he said. Then he added: 'But we would expect to hold them high if they want to continue working with us. 'This is an unprecedented situation. We have just given a significant grant to the Wear Anti-Fascist League, . which puts into context where the city council stands. The people of the city would expect us to take a moral stance on this.' Last night the Durham Miners' Association showed the first signs of seeking a truce with the club's new coach. Dave Hopper, the general secretary of . the DMA, said: 'We think this (Di Canio's statement) is the solution to . the problem. It takes a brave man to put forward what he has, given the . past few days. We hope it's sincere. 'If it is then we can put to bed our . issue and let Paolo Di Canio get on with what he's been brought here to . do. The club have come around and we hope there's cognisance of people's . feelings in future before making appointments.' Dear Paolo Di Canio, . We have never met, and I am the first to admit that I don't know very much about football. You do, and I respect that. However, I hope you will allow me to say something about your appointment as manager at Sunderland FC as personally as I can. My relationship with the Black Cats goes back a long way. I married into a family of fervent lifelong Sunderland supporters. My wife and I got engaged on Cup Final Day 1973, figuring that if Sunderland won her father would say yes to anything and if they lost, he would be past caring. All these years we have wanted SAFC to do well. We have been glad when it did, and sad when it didn't. We know how much its football success has meant for the people of Sunderland and the North East who are rightly proud of your new Club. But today I am wondering what to do. Your appointment raises very difficult questions. You see, I am the child of a Jewish war refugee who got out of Germany and came to Britain just in time. Some of her family and friends perished in the Nazi death camps. So I find your self-confessed fascism deeply troubling. Fascism was nearly the undoing of the world. It cost millions of innocent lives. Mussolini, who you say has been deeply misunderstood, openly colluded with it. You are said to wear a tattoo DUX which speaks for itself. This all adds up to what I find baffling. You say that you are not a racist, but it needs great sophistication to understand how fascism and racism are ultimately different. I can promise you that this distinction will be lost on the people of the North East where the British National Party is finding fertile ground in which to sow the seeds of its pernicious and poisonous doctrine. You did not necessarily know this before you came. But I believe that unless you clearly renounce fascism in all its manifestations, you will be associated with these toxic far-right tendencies we have seen too much of in this region. At your press conference today, you had the chance to do this, to say in so many words that you have been misunderstood (just as you say Mussolini was). You were asked where you stood on fascism, but declined to give an unambiguous response. One sentence is all that it would have taken. I'm genuinely perplexed as to why you didn't take the opportunity that was handed to you. Maybe your minders told you to stay on-message. But don't you see that it is no answer to plead that this press call was about football, not politics. Where a Premier League club is concerned, you can't ever separate the two. Politics and high-profile sport, like religion, are about the whole of life. Football is deeply political. To say otherwise may be convenient, but it's naive. Premier League players and managers are big role-models for the young. Is fascism what you or Sunderland FC want our children and teenagers to admire and emulate? And if this doesn't trouble you personally, should it not trouble those who appointed you? The Club now stands to suffer loss of support as well as see its standing and respect damaged not just in this part of the world but internationally. Its reputation has been hard won. I am just one of thousands who would be sad to see it squandered. So there it is. Please tell me how to go on supporting the Black Cats with a good conscience, even from the sofa, because believe me, I want to. Please tell me that I have misunderstood, or missed some fundamental issue here. I am simply telling you with a heavy heart that it feels hard at the moment to stay loyal. Yours sincerely, .

Two versions of Vincent Van Gogh's iconic Sunflowers painting will be reunited when they are displayed alongside each other for the first time. In a rare loan, the copy of Sunflowers owned by the . Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam will be put on show side-by-side with the London original in the Netherlands this year. Next year the Amsterdam copy with travel for the first time to the National Gallery in London. The sunflower on the left, the London version, is painted with rougher strokes than the Dutch version on the right, which was painted five months later . The first piece was one of four . created at Arles, in the south of France, in August 1888 while the . second was one of three 'repetitions' Van Gogh produced in January 1889. They have been displayed . together in public only once before in 2001, as part of a joint . exhibition between the Van Gogh Museum and Art Institute Chicago. Only five of the series are on show . to the public, the others are at Neue Pinakothek, Munich, Germany, the . U.S. at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and at the Sompo Japan Museum of . Art in Tokyo. These galleries rarely allow their . versions to travel, but the British and Dutch galleries have agreed to . mark the end a ten-year research . project by the Van Gogh Museum, which is also celebrating its 40th . anniversary. Axel Ruger, director of the Dutch museum, said: 'The biggest outcome of the [research project] is that we can counter a common perception about Van Gogh - that he was mad, that he attacked the canvas and worked in a manic way and just cranked out these works. 'What the research has shown is that he worked very carefully. He studied other artists. He studied colour theory. He had a huge repertoire of works that he had seen in galleries kept in his head. Gauguin captured Van Gogh at the easel painting sunflowers, a subject the Dutch artist rendered many times . 'He approached his art-making in a very methodical way. That's quite different from common perceptions of him as the artist who madly throws paint at the canvas.' Visitors will be able to see the changes that Van Gogh introduced in the Amsterdam copy, which is brighter and features a sunflower with blue seeds. The differences betray a fundamental change in the artist's approach, an expert at the museum said. Louis van Tilborgh, a senior researcher . at the Van Gogh Museum, told The Times that the London original was . intended as a radical work to impress Paul Gauguin, with whom Van Gogh . wished to collaborate. A self portrait by Vincent Van Gogh who painted a series of Sunflowers that are on show around the world . 'The first one was meant to be simply a statement by Van Gogh to show Gaughin that he was able to join the modern art movement as Gauguin had,' he said. 'It's what you would call a primitive kind of idea of sunflowers.' The Amsterdam copy, created after Gaughin had left Arles, had an entirely different purpose. The flowers became symbols of the artists' shared time in Arles, so rather than emphasise them wilting he made them bold and bright. 'He wanted the flowers to shine like candles, so what you see in our picture is that he is changing his mind, adjusting the meaning of the painting.' The National Gallery's painting was bought for the nation in 1924 for £1,308. The copy now held in Japan bought by Japanese insurance magnate Yasuo Goto at Christie's in 1987 for a then-record £25million. The price was over four times the previous record of about $12million paid for Andrea Mantegna's Adoration of the Magi in 1985. The record was broken a few months later with the purchase of another Van Gogh, Irises, by Alan Bond for $53.9million at Sotheby's, New York on November 11, 1987. Van Gogh intended to decorate Gauguin's room with these paintings in the so-called Yellow House that he rented in Arles in the south of France. He and Gauguin worked there together between October and December 1888. Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo in August 1888, 'I am hard at it, painting with the enthusiasm of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when you know that what I'm at is the painting of some sunflowers. 'If I carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels. So the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow. I am working at it every morning from sunrise on, for the flowers fade so quickly. 'I am now on the fourth picture of sunflowers. This fourth one is a bunch of 14 flowers ... it gives a singular effect.' The dying flowers are built up with thick brushstrokes (impasto). The impasto evokes the texture of the seed-heads. Van Gogh produced the replica of this painting, now held in Amsterdam, in January 1889, and perhaps another one later in the year. The various versions and replicas remain much debated among Van Gogh scholars.","Copy owned by museum in Amsterdam will be displayed with original .

A husband and wife who fuelled their lavish lifestyle by exploiting immigrants' desperation to stay in the UK have been jailed. Syed Yousuf, 39, from Birmingham, and his wife Jabin Bi, 48, are believed to have pocketed more than £100,000 by charging to forge documents - while also claiming thousands in benefits and attempting to build a property empire. They both pleaded guilty to 26 immigration offences and applying for a £267,000 mortgage with Nationwide in 2010 to fraudulently buy one of three homes. Jailed: Syed Yousuf (left) and his wife Jabin Bi (right) pleaded guilty to 26 immigration offences after pocketing more than £100,000 from their deceit . Yousuf was sentenced to four years ten months and Bi was given a severely reduced sentence of 24 months at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday. The couple initially helped to keep . non-EU immigrants in the country as a 'good will gesture', but . eventually found they were able to profit by charging them for fraudulent documents. Yousuf and his wife initially charged immigrants already in the UK up to £6,000 to help keep them in the country. The exact amount they earned through their criminality is unknown, but the Crown Prosecution Service estimated it to be more than £100,000. Judge Gregory Dickinson QC said the couple orchestrated a 'sophisticated' and 'devious' operation by conspiring to help 23 different people, many strangers, obtain leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception. Judge Dickinson told Yousuf: 'You deliberately sought to take advantage of the rules. 'Fraudulent documents have your handwriting on them, you used your bank accounts, you committed the crimes on your own premises and fabricated numerous identities.' Arfan Ali (left) was handed a 19-month jail term after being described as a foot soldier in the criminal activity. Sounia Jabin (right) was given a 12-month community order and 100 hours voluntary work after she was charged with falsely claiming £4,500 in housing benefits . Yousuf, who was 'at the heart of the . scam', came to the UK in 2000 to teach English and claimed to earn . £70,000 a year - but the court heard he paid no tax or National . Insurance on his earnings. Bi also pleaded guilty to five other charges of fraud, including applying for two further mortgages totalling £470,000 and claiming almost £45,000 in benefits. Judge Dickinson told the mother-of-seven that he would be 'as merciful' as possible but she only had herself to blame. He added: 'This will be tough, your children will be effectively stripped of their parents following today's sentencing. 'But you have brought it on yourself.' His words were met with tears as Bi sat in the docks weeping. Her family in court were also sobbing as she was told she would spend at least a year behind bars. The mum, who was previously described by peers as having high 'moral values and never trying to deceive', cried out as she was taken away by the court officer. Sentence: Yousuf was sentenced to four years ten months and Bi was given a severely reduced sentence of 24 months at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday . Bi said: 'Please don't take me, my children need me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt, please.' Yousuf, who had been sentenced earlier in the hearing, showed no emotion as he left the dock. His stepdaughter Sounia Jabin sat behind him charged with falsely claiming £4,500 in housing benefits. She was given a 12-month community order and told to do 100 hours of voluntary work 'to pay back her community' for what she took. Jabin gripped her mother as she was taken away to serve her sentence. Judge Dickinson claimed that her actions were a product of being surrounding by her criminal parents. The sentences were welcomed by . Birmingham City Council who thanked investigating officers for foiling . the family's benefit fraud and upholding a system 'designed to protect . the most vulnerable in society'. 'We are cracking down on immigration . crime, detaining, prosecuting and removing people and gangs who have . been abusing the immigration system' - Andy Radcliffe, from the Home Office's West Midlands Criminal and Financial Investigation team . Councillor Ian Ward, deputy leader of the council, said: 'The amount of money illegally claimed was staggering and this case clearly demonstrates we will do everything we can to pursue offenders. 'I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of our investigating officers for sending out a clear message to anyone thinking about doing the same - we will identify fraud and we will prosecute you.' Yousef and Bi were also sentenced with Afran Ali, described as a foot soldier of their criminal activity, and Thi Luu. Ali, who travelled from Pakistan to the UK in 2004 on a two-year student visa, was handed a 19-month jail term for his involvement in the scam. Judge Dickinson said there was no evidence Ali benefited financially from the activity and that he was in no way in control of the dealings. The 35-year-old is currently serving three years for conspiring to produce cannabis and will be immediately deported on completion of his sentence. Mother-of-two Luu, who is now a British citizen after arriving in Birmingham illegally nine years ago, paid the couple £6,000 to help her stay in Britain. Judge Dickinson said: 'It would not be in the public's interest to put you behind bars and make you a burden on society.' She was handed a 12-month sentence suspended for 18 months for lying in order to remain in the UK. Andy Radcliffe, from the Home Office's West Midlands Criminal and Financial Investigation team, said: 'We are cracking down on immigration crime, detaining, prosecuting and removing people and gangs who have been abusing the immigration system.

Locked-up: Edmund Jaques, has been jailed for 18 months for running a money-spinning racket throughout East Anglia which conned the NHS out of £78,000 . A dentist who cheated the NHS out of £78,000 by billing for 1,700 patients he did not treat - including some who were dead - has been jailed for 18 months. Edmund Jaques, from Kentford, near Newmarket, Suffolk, was locked up yesterday after he ran a money-spinning racket throughout East Anglia called Home Dental Care Ltd. The 64-year-old travelled to care homes throughout Suffolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire treating elderly residents who weren't able to visit a surgery. Jaques had set up lucrative contracts with North East Essex Primary Care Trust and Cambridgeshire Primary Care Trust. Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said that during visits to care homes the dentist had specially asked for lists of residents which he had taken away with him. Mr Shaw told Ipswich Crown Court: 'He would take these lists of residents away and fill out claim forms for treating patients without having treated them at all. 'On a number of occasions not only did he not provide treatment but because the population of care homes changed quite regularly a number of people for whom he was claiming to have provided treatment had died.' Jaques, who has been a dentist for 41 years, aroused suspicion because he was claiming for such a high number of treatments. Police searched his home and seized documents on which he had practised writing the signatures of senior care home staff so he could forge them on claim forms. Jaques admitted fraud between June 16, 2009 and March 12, 2011 by dishonestly submitting multiple FP17 claim forms for payment of dental treatment in respect of patients neither seen nor treated by him. Jailing him for 18 months, Judge John Holt said the dentist had been a respected professional who was expected to be trusted. Judge Holt made a confiscation order for £78,658 which will be paid as compensation to the NHS. Craig Ferguson, defending, said Jaques had not pleaded guilty to the offence earlier because he had wanted to attend his daughter's wedding last month. Fraud: Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) heard how the dentist would fill out claim forms for patients he had not treated . Mr Ferguson said he qualified as a dentist in 1972 and had started treating residents of care homes after he was seriously injured in a car crash and was left unable to stand all day treating patients in his surgery. He said Jaques had been previously of good character and felt 'a deep sense of shame and remorse' for what he had done. Mr Ferguson said he had obtained £78,000 from the NHS over a period of 21 months for 1,700 patients he had not treated. He said that Jaques would never work as a dentist again. Nearly 1,200 dentists in England and Wales earned more than £200,000 in the financial year 2007-08, official figures showed in August 2009. The NHS Information Centre statistics show that 382 dentists - nearly two per cent of the total - earned more than £300,000 in the year. Average take home pay for the 19,586 registered dentists was £89,062.","Edmund Jaques jailed for 18 months after admitting fraud .

A man who cannot walk, has to rely on a mobility scooter and struggles to talk after a tumour left him brain damaged has been declared 'fit for work'. Mark Evans had received Incapacity Benefit, now known as Employment and Support Allowance, since 1993 when he suffered a brain injury because of a tumour. But the 50-year-old, who had his left leg amputated below the knee in 2004 due to deep vein thrombosis,  has now had his benefits cut by £440 a month, leaving him with just £220 to pay his rent, bills and buy food. Mark Evans (pictured with Denise Lonsdale from the Unemployed Advice Centre in Bolton) who despite having had a brain tumour and his leg amputated, has been declared fit to work . He had his case reviewed in a Work Capability Assessment as part of a government drive to overhaul the benefits system and his Employment and Support Allowance was stopped. Mr Evans launched an appeal, which was recently heard 127 miles away in Workington, Cumbria. His disability meant he was unable to travel to the hearing and the case was found against him in his absence. Mr Evans, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'It's wrong, they were saying go there, go there, go there, and I couldn't.' He has now had his benefits cut from £760 a month to just £320 - and £100 of that has to be spent paying for his mobility scooter so he can have some independence. Denise Lonsdale, volunteer manager at Bolton Unemployed Advice Centre, has been fighting to have Mr Evans's benefits reinstated. Mr Evans had a Work Capability Assessment as part of a government drive to overhaul the benefits system . She said if she can not overturn the decision, Mr Evans, faces a three-month wait before he can make a fresh claim for benefits - and in the meantime must survive on just £220. Ms Lonsdale said: 'They had this appeal in Workington but he couldn't get there. 'The Jobcentre won't accept him because he's not fit for work, so he can't have Employment Support Allowance or Jobseekers Allowance. 'Because his money has been stopped he's got no money for gas and he needs to keep warm because of his amputation.' This week, Mr Evans was given a crisis loan of £142 to pay his rent and bills, which he has to repay at £8 a week. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'The old incapacity benefits system condemned too many people to a life on benefits with little hope of moving back to work. 'Now, people who can work will be given help to find a job while those who need unconditional support will get it. Since 2010 we have considerably improved the Work Capability Assessment process. 'As a result the percentage of people getting long-term unconditional support has more than doubled in two years, but everyone has the right to appeal if they disagree with the outcome of their assessment.' Ms Lonsdale, a former care worker who has volunteered at the centre for the past 24 years, says Mr Evans' case is not a one off. She says her workload has trebled in the past 12 months because of the impact of welfare reforms, the economic downturn, and cuts to other advice services such as the CAB. She said: 'It's getting worse, with rises in homelessness, redundancies and people needing access to food banks. 'I'm dealing with between 150-200 people a week, people are coming in Saturdays and Sundays and we're even giving out bread.'","Mark Evans has received benefits since he had brain tumour in 1993 .

Ian Lee Wilson drove the children, aged five, two and one, to nursery despite being more than five times over the legal alcohol limit. The 40-year-old admitted drink-driving and dangerous driving at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates Court in County Durham yesterday after committing the offence the day before. Ian Lee Wilson admitted drink-driving and dangerous driving at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates Court yesterday . Claire Brinton, prosecuting, said Wilson, from Darlington, had dropped the children off at around 9am and returned to his black Vauxhall Meriva vehicle in Haughton Road in the town. She added: 'He then collided with a number of vehicles. 'When attempting to leave the scene he almost knocked down one of the drivers who had got out to inspect the damage. 'He missed the man by inches.' Ms Brinton described how Wilson went on to crash into a taxi with considerable force. 'The taxi driver made the decision to follow the defendant, flashing her headlights and blasting her horn to make him stop,' she said. Wilson picked his car up in Haughton Road, Darlington, (pictured) before colliding with several cars after dropping his children off at nursery . 'He went straight into the back of a black car.' The court heard how the taxi driver got out her car and confronted Wilson, who tried to prevent her from opening the door. 'A tug of war situation occurs, but the taxi driver manages to open the door and snatch the keys from the ignition,' said Ms Brinton. 'She described being hit by a strong smell of alcohol.' Wilson, who had been drinking the previous night, was arrested and tested positive for alcohol. The lowest reading revealed 188 microgrammes (mg) of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than five times the legal limit of 35 mg. In interview, Wilson, who received an 18-month disqualification in 2007 for drink-driving, said he had been an 'idiot' and admitted he had exposed his children to danger. Nick Woodward, mitigating, said Wilson was suffering from depression and had turned to alcohol when he lost his job. He urged magistrates not to send the case to crown court, emphasising how Wilson had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. However, chairman Nigel Scott, said the bench's sentencing powers were not sufficient for so serious a matter and committed the case to Durham Crown Court on April 24 for sentence.

Shopkeeper Imran Pervais (pictured) is accused of deliberately trying to short-change a customer so he could keep the winning amount himself . A shopkeeper tried to claim an £80,000 lottery jackpot by telling the lucky ticket holder he had only won £10, a court heard. Imran Pervais is accused of deliberately trying to short-change Callum Crosier, who was part of syndicate of 28, so he could keep the winning amount himself. Mr. Crosier said his winning ticket was found screwed up in a ball under the counter at Pervais' store after he had been given just £10 for it. The alleged con came after Mr. Crosier went to Moores Convenience Store in Gravesend, Kent, and handed over four tickets from the previous Saturday's National Lottery draw. Each contained seven lines and the first produced a £10 win with a corresponding pink receipt-type slip of paper. The second ticket produced nothing but when the third was checked it also produced a pink slip. Mr. Crosier told Maidstone Crown Court he asked Pervais 'What's that, another tenner?' and the 26 year-old shopkeeper allegedly replied 'Yes'. Having been told he had won a total of £20 Mr Crosier used the money and a further £8 to buy another 28 lines for the next draw. The court heard he then left the shop and spent the weekend in Germany watching Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in the Champions' League Final last May. On his return he checked his numbers on a spreadsheet he used for an additional 'in-house' bingo game played by his syndicate of 28 work colleagues at Morrisons Utility Services in Chatham, Kent. It was then that he realised they had won more than £10 and he went back to the store to double-check the ticket which he had given Pervais. He mistakenly thought they had successfully picked out five numbers and stood to win £1,000 - when in fact they also had the bonus ball and had won £79,887. The jury heard that Pervais was there when Mr Crosier arrived and appeared to be 'taken aback' when he told him about their win. Pervais and other staff agreed to search for his ticket and told Mr Crosier to return a few hours later. The court heard that Mr. Crosier then told Camelot what had happened and gave them the unique number for the store's lottery terminal. Having returned to work still without the missing ticket, Mr Crosier checked his numbers again online and discovered the true size of their win. The alleged con came after Mr. Crosier went to Moores Convenience Store in Gravesend, Kent, (pictured) and handed over four tickets from the previous Saturday's National Lottery draw . 'I just sunk,' he told the jury. 'I was gutted because this had gone from £10 to £1,000 to almost 80 grand. 'I went and told my boss and he hit the roof and told me to get back down that shop and find that ticket.' Pervais was in the shop when Mr. Crosier went back to look for his ticket - this time with two colleagues. He said: 'You can imagine my mood had changed slightly from winning £1,000. 'I said: ""I'm not leaving this shop until I have this ticket in my hand. It's worth £80,000 and something is not right here."" I wasn't messing around, I wanted my ticket.' The court heard that staff, including Pervais, gave Mr Crosier and his pals bin bags to search and after about 15 minutes he was invited to search behind the counter. Wooden platforms were removed from the base of the counter and when one of the shop staff swept underneath with a broom out came a lottery ticket rolled up into a ball. Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) heard how Pervais was arrested after Camelot carried out an investigation into the incident . Mr Crosier added: 'As he opened the ticket I saw the date and grabbed it out of his hand straight away and said: ""That's my ticket."" I then recognised the numbers. 'I was just relieved to have the ticket,' he said. 'I wasn't suspecting anything.' During cross-examination he agreed Pervais had offered him the winning tickets and corresponding pink slips back when he initially went to the store on May 18. 'That's my fault for being too trustworthy of someone I have known for a few years,' added Mr Crosier. The court heard Camelot launched their own investigation, which led to Pervais' arrest the following month and the money was paid out to the syndicate. The prosecution claim that Pervais 'deliberately and dishonestly' misled Mr. Crosier and the only 'logical conclusion' was that he could claim the winning £79,887 himself. But the defendant - who denies fraud by false misrepresentation - claims the short-changing was a mistake. The trial continues.

Craig Swainson avoided a prison sentence for a late night street attack that left victim Sean Moss blind in one eye, after his co-accused was dealt with at youth court and was given a rehabilitation order . Two drunken yobs have escaped jail after an apparent blunder by the courts despite having left their victim blinded in one eye. Craig Swainson clenched his fists with delight and grinned when he was spared prison for the late-night street attack. A judge said he was being forced to pass a lenient sentence because the other yob was wrongly dealt with by a youth court. Victim Sean Moss suffered horrific facial fractures when he was knocked to the ground and kicked in the centre of Darlington, County Durham. The father-of-two, a self-employed tiler, told in a victim impact statement how the drunken attack has ruined his life. Mr Moss has regained some sight in his left eye but may never be able to see properly again, Teesside Crown Court heard. The court was told that he has been registered disabled and unable to continue working since the brutal attack in August. Swainson was caught on town centre closed circuit television cameras - along with another yob - leaving Mr Moss unconscious. The other attacker - who cannot be named - was earlier dealt with by the youth court and was given a rehabilitation order. A crown court judge, a senior prosecutor and an experienced probation officer all questioned the validity of the sentence. Although he was aged 17 at the time of the assault, he was 18 when he was dealt with and should have been sent to the crown court. His punishment is the kind that is reserved for under-18s only - but it had to be used as a bench-mark for Swainson. He was given a nine-month suspended prison term after Recorder Bernard Gateshill, QC, said: 'I have to take into consideration they way in which he was dealt with. 'It seems to me that it would be harsh, indeed, if you were sent immediately to prison when your co-accused appears to have been dealt with in a very lenient way. 'It would have been far better if he had been committed to this court for sentence so you could have both been dealt with together, and I see no reason why that could not have been done, bearing in mind he was 18.' Passing sentence at Teesside Crown Court, Recorder Bernard Gateshill, QC, said it would be 'harsh' if Swainson was jailed immediately when his co-accused 'appears to have been deal with in a very lenient way' Swainson, 21, from Darlington, and the teenager, both pleaded guilty to a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm. Video camera footage showed the younger attacker wrestle Mr Moss to the ground when the victim approached their group pointing his finger. David Lamb, mitigating, said the apprentice scaffolder had expressed 'real and genuine remorse' for his involvement in the attack. He said there had been an earlier argument in a kebab shop when Swainson was punched, and added: 'There does appear to be a degree of provocation.' In an impact statement, Mr Moss said: 'Whoever assaulted me has totally changed my life. 'I am registered disabled and I'm upset, distressed and angry. I am in constant fear about being alone and won't go out into the front street. I cannot take the children to the local park without another adult.' Euro MP Martin Callanan said: 'Cases like this bring the whole justice system into disrepute. 'I would hope that the Attorney General will look urgently at the dreadful inadequacy of these sentences and consider intervening. 'The victim has been completely let down.' A CPS spokesman said: 'The case of a youth defendant facing these charges could only be sent to the Crown Court if the adult co-defendant was to be tried there. 'It is not possible for youth defendants to be tried alone at Crown Court on these particular charges and as Craig Swainston, the adult defendant, pleaded guilty and did not face a Crown Court trial, there was no option but to send the youth defendant’s case to the Youth Court.'","Judge tells Craig Swainson he was forced to pass lenient sentence .

Talhat Rehman faces being jailed after pleading guilty to two counts of having a knife in public when he threatened to kill himself outside Buckingham Palace . A butcher tasered by police when he threatened to kill himself outside Buckingham Palace faces up to four years in jail after pleading guilty today. Talhat Rehman, 54, was shot with a 50,000-volt Taser gun after he held a knife to his throat and another to his chest during the Changing of the Guards ceremony on February 3. Horrified onlookers watched as Rehman jumped the barricades just before noon waving an eight inch knife and a smaller blade. He then shouted: 'I want to die. Stay back, I'll do it, I'll do it.' The halal butcher, who unsuccessfully stood as a Tory councillor in 2002, was Tasered by officers who then seized the knives. It later emerged Rehman, who has a history of psychotic episodes, wanted to appeal directly to the Queen for help after he lost £170,000 in a botched business deal. The Queen and Prince Philip were at Sandringham at the time. He is being held in a secure hospital and was originally deemed unfit to plead but today he admitted two counts of having a bladed article in a public place. A charge of affray was dropped by the prosecution after Rehman's barrister Gillian Frost said there was no evidence he wanted to hurt others, just himself. Opening the case, prosecutor Peter Zinner said: 'It was a serious incident outside Buckingham Palace. 'The photographs demonstrate very clearly Mr Rehman armed himself with two large kitchen knives and held one to his throat and the other one close to his chest. 'He was heard to shout that he wanted to kill himself. 'This disturbance obviously caused a great deal of alarm to members of the public present at about 11.50am watching the Changing of the Guards. 'He then shouted ""I want to die. Stay back, I'll do it, I'll do it"".'

Describing the background to the incident Mr Zinner explained: 'The defendant had been having difficulties in relation to a previous business arrangement he had with a solicitor who he blames for his current and ongoing financial situation.' Rehman's son Kassum Raja, 30, from Harrow, north-west London, said: 'My father's solicitor stole from him and when he took her to court she closed down the firm. 'He went to the police but they said it would be a huge bundle of work for them and told us he would have to go private. 'He was in a desperate situation, so he went to his Queen. He said he was going to deliver a letter to Buckingham Palace or he would kill himself.' Southwark Crown Court heard how Rehman shouted, 'I want to die. Stay back, I'll do it, I'll do it' during the incident last month . The solicitor has since been . disqualified but Rehman's family claim he has lost his butcher's . business, savings and spent £30,000 on legal fees in a desperate attempt . to get it back. They also say the granddad - who has five children and 18 grandchildren - never had mental health problems until he lost the money. Rehman, who wore a beige striped jumper and a brown bodywarmer in the dock, is being looked after by a mental health team at Park Royal Hospital in Middlesex where he must stay on a secure ward. Judge Patricia May QC adjourned sentencing for reports. He will next appear before Southwark Crown Court on May 22.

For some of even the most experienced drivers, parallel parking might not be the easiest manoeuvre. And the pressure of being watched by other drivers can make it even worse. But imagine having to pull of a high-speed parking move, using only the handbrake and the streeting wheel, to skid into a space with just five inches to spare - or 13.1cm - a gap shorter than the length of an average pencil. However, driven on by brotherly competition, Alastair and John Moffatt, from Gloucester, managed to do exactly that when they beat the tightest parallel parking world record. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attempt: John Moffat was the first to break the world record, which saw him speed up to the space in the Mini Mayfair . Stunt: He then had to use only his handbrake and steering wheel to skid into the space . Tight fit: The space was just five inches bigger than the car itself . Easy does it: John appears to have got it just right as he begins to bring the manoeuvre to an end . The brothers used their amazing accuracy and driving skills to beat the previous world record, held by Ronny Wechselberger, which measured in at 14cm. Driving vintage Mini Mayfairs, each of the brothers attempted the stunt, watched on by the cameras and adjudicators. They had to skid the car into the space in one go, without touching either of the other vehicles or a white mark which outlined what would normally be the pavement. John, 31, was the first to break the record. He told This Is Gloucestershire: 'When I broke the world record I was in shock.' Alastair, his elder brother by two years, then matched the feat, once again after a number of attempts. How close? The car just about manages to squeeze into the gap . Success: The car appears to be perfectly in place . Judgement: The adjudicators have to assess whether all of the rules have been adhered to . Nervous wait: John waits with his hands over his mouth as the judges decide on whether the record has been broken . New world record: The judges make their decision and John takes the record . He said: 'When I achieved it, all I felt was relief. The light was fading and I only had one or two attempts left so the pressure was on. 'The fact that we hold the world record together is great as we are very competitive with each other but John continually reminds me that he got it first.'

A pioneering NHS surgeon is helping Syrian bomb blast victims walk again by creating prosthetic limbs - made from drainpipes and tyres. Viquar Qurashi has created 114 makeshift false legs for amputees who have been injured during the bloody conflict in the war-torn country. Mr Qurashi, a surgeon at Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley, West Midlands, uses his spare time to create the prostheses using a groundbreaking technique. Scroll down for video . Pioneering: Surgeon Viquar Qurashi. from Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley, is helping Syrian bomb blast victims get back on their feet by creating prosthetic limbs made from drainpipes and tyres . He melts down the drainpipes - which are donated by a Turkish businessman - in a furnace before sculpting them into leg-shapes around a mould of each victim . He then fashions artificial feet using recycled rubber taken from car tyres . He spends up to a day-and-a-half melting down the drainpipes - which are donated by a Turkish businessman - in a furnace before sculpting them into leg-shapes around a mould of each victim. He then fashions artificial feet using recycled rubber taken from car tyres. It means the process can produce an artificial limb which usually costs the NHS £1,200 - for just £30. Mr Qurashi flew out to Reyhanli - on the Turkish Syrian border - two weeks ago to fit them to victims using metal pins and leather straps. He is helped by a team of six technicians from Pakistan in a makeshift clinic and workshop to help those hurt by the two-year war that has so-far claimed 70,000 lives. Mr Qurashi, from Dudley, said yesterday: ""I became involved in this in 2007 after the earthquake in my home country of Pakistan. 'I flew back to help and ended up doing hundreds of amputations. 'Afterwards I realised nothing was being done for them after the amputation. 'They would be left to either become beggars or to die in hospitals of bed sores. One of the 114 beneficaries is seven-year-old Hussain Mubarak, from Pakistan . Then and now: Mr Qurashi feared not enough was being done to help amputees such as Hussain . Up and about: The limbs will last up to seven years and even if they break, they are not difficult to replace . 'We're very lucky in the west, we have things like the NHS to help us through, but other in the less developed countries they have nothing, and their corrupt governments don't care enough about them. 'The limbs we have in the west are very good, but far too expensive, but after some research I found a similar technique had been developed in Pakistan in 1962. 'I modified it and realised that it could be done really cheaply to give these people their lives back. 'The limbs will last up to seven years and even if they break it's not hard to replace them. 'They are not as sophisticated as a western limb but a prosthetic limb costing up to a £1,000 here in Britain will be of little use to someone who doesn't have the money, technology and tools to maintain it. 'We can make limbs from drainpipe material for £30 and provide them free to those in need. 'The patients go back to their profession, to study, they go back to colleges, university, take up jobs. Custom made: Mr Qurashi melts down the drainpipes - which are donated by a Turkish businessman - in a furnace before sculpting them into leg-shapes around a mould of each victim . It means the process can produce an artificial limb which usually costs the NHS £1,200 - for just £30 . Work in progress: A technician from the work shop in Pakistan making an artificial leg . Basic: Mr Qurashi said that while the limbs aren't highly sophisticated, they work well for people in poorer countries who don't have the money or technology to maintain them . 'A group of ten volunteers and training technicians from Syria have been selected to take up this job in future. 'I would say it is like comparing a 1962 Skoda to a Mercedes Benz, they both work as cars, so there is no shame.' In 2005, Mr Qurashi set up the Naya Qadam Trust, non-profit organisation of volunteer overseas Pakistani doctors, which helps fund the artificial limb materials. He hopes to take the limbs to other countries such as Haiti, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Vietnam. Paula Clark, Chief Executive of The Dudley Hospital Group said, 'We are very proud of Mr Qurashi and his altruistic work with amputees in Syria. 'It demonstrates the commitment and dedication of all staff who work for the Trust.'","Viquar Qurashi, from Dudley, has created 114 false legs for amputees .

The advert for Skol ice cream shows a yellow tub that looks like a beer can, with the tagline: 'Shall we go to the bar to have an ice cream?' The ice cream, launched in November, does not contain alcohol and is only sold in bars in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, meaning children should not be able to buy it. The advert for Skol-flavoured ice cream appeared on the brand's website and Facebook page . It can only be sold to people over the age of 18 because it is linked to a beer brand. The National Council for Self-Regulation fears that the campaign, which appeared on Skol's website and Facebook page, could make drinking seem attractive to children - especially as the social networking site does not restrict what under-18s can see. The council does not have legal powers to force Ambev, Skol's owner, to take the advert down and said it was only a warning to be more careful in the future.

'You were travelling around the North East to different locations, stealing high value perfume in the main. 'This is all aggravated by your record and by the fact you were in a suspended sentence order and a community order.

Mr Jack, who was known as Jim, was from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, and his family has been informed. Northern Constabulary said their search and recovery of the body was supported by the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team and an RAF helicopter. An RAF search and rescue helicopter, like the one pictured, assisted the Lochaber Mountain Rescue team in the operation . The Walk Highlands website describes Streap, which has a peak of 994 yards, as a 'magnificent mountain' but warns of 'very rough, rocky and often pathless' conditions. The death is the latest in a series of accidents in the Scottish mountains this year. Four people were killed during an avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian in . January.

It came on the same day that a body of a man was discovered in Wick River, in the north Highlands close to John o'Groats. A spokesman for the Northern Constabulary said its specialist crime division are currently investigating the death. In total 13 climbers and walkers have died on Scotland`s mountains this year - seven of them in avalanches. The latest death comes after a major safety warning was issued by Britain's top mountaineering bodies for climbers and walkers to be 'realistic about the seriousness' on Scottish mountains. 'It will soon be Easter, but it's still full-on winter in Scotland's mountains,' said the councils, who represent more than 85,000 members between them.

A coroner gave a verdict of accidental death and said he believed Mr McNulty had blacked out before the fall . A roofer who fell to his death while pruning a tree had weaned himself off medication for vertigo, an inquest heard. Craig McNulty landed on his feet on the concrete below the tree before falling back and hitting his head, suffering 'catastrophic' injuries on August 1 last year. He had been helping his partner's father to cut branches at her sister's home. Mr McNulty, 38, had been prescribed medication for vertigo after a previous fall from 12ft-high scaffolding in 2011. He told doctors he was worried because he had felt dizzy and blacked out. Bradford Coroner's Court heard that Mr McNulty, a father-of-one, had been referred to a neurologist and given his vertigo diagnosis. At a follow-up appointment in February 2012, he reported that he had felt dizzy and blacked out again while picking something up in the shower. Mr McNulty, of Batley, West Yorkshire, was advised 'to stop working at heights' and to stop driving. By June last year, he 'admitted he had weaned himself off the medication and said he never felt better.' Deputy coroner Oliver Longstaff said nobody knew why Mr McNulty had done this, but it was possible he wanted to get his driving licence back. There was no evidence Mr McNulty had tried to break his fall to save himself, said Acting Detective Inspector Matt Hawke. Passing a verdict of accidental death, Mr Longstaff said: 'It seems to . me more likely than not that Mr McNulty had blacked out again before he . fell.' He added that he did not need to resolve whether the blackout was related to not taking the medication. Speaking after his death last year, Mr . McNulty's partner of 15 years, Sharon McNulty, said: 'Craig was the most . generous, giving person you could ever meet. 'He was always doing something for . somebody and worked for the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, . helping troubled youngsters achieve a trade. ‘He spent all his time making other people happy and hopefully we’ll be able to carry that on. Mr McNulty had been prescribed vertigo medication after a fall in 2011 but had stopped taking it by June 2012 . 'He was always doing something for somebody. You'd ask him to do something and five minutes later he would be doing it.' The family has raised more than £1,000 for the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, which flew Mr McNulty to hospital, since his death. They also opened their cafe in Dewsbury on Christmas Day to carry out Mr McNulty's plan to serve dinner to 50 homeless people.","Craig McNulty, 38, suffered 'catastrophic' injuries in accident in August 2012 .

At five storeys high, it stood in the middle of a newly-built motorway as a symbol of resistance. But after refusing to relocate while authorities built a giant road around their home, an elderly Chinese couple has finally admitted defeat. In front of a crowd of onlookers, bulldozers and diggers moved in to tear the stubborn house to the ground. Luo Baogen and his wife previously insisted on staying . in the half-demolished building in the city of Wenling, Zhejiang . province, because they believed that the relocation compensation . offered by the government was not enough. Beginning of the end: Work began on the house's deconstruction on Saturday city of Wenling, Zhejiang province. It is understood the couple finally accepted a compensation deal to relocate . Tumbling down: Onlookers gather to watch the house being demolished. It had become a symbol of resistance against developers . Standing strong: Luo Baogen, 67, who lived in the house on the outskirts of Wenling in east China's Zhejiang province, previously refused to leave as he said the compensation offered was no enough . The couple were the only the only remaining occupants of their neighbourhood after the road was constructed to lead to a new rail station on the outskirts of the city. The road had not yet been officially opened while the couple still lived in the property - a situation that would have made their occupancy even more dangerous. Duck farmer Luo, 67, had previously refused the Government's paltry compensation of 220,000 yuan (£22,000) for relocation. He spent 600,000 yuan (£60,000) completing the house. It is understood that the couple finally accepted an increased offer of 260,000 yuan (£26,000) so see their home demolished. Chinese authorities often pressure residents into accepting compensation packages if their homes are in the way of development projects. Extreme methods, such as cutting off utilities, are often used to hasten the eviction. But Luo's village chief said that the . man had voluntarily accepted the offer and had tired of the attention . his home was receiving. Proof: Mr Baogen stands in front of his home holding the certificate that states he owns the land beneath it, meaning that he and his wife could't be forced to move away . King of the road: The house stood strong in the middle of the highway after their entire neighbourhood had been torn down . Calm before the storm: The balcony from Mr Baogen's home looked peaceful, but he was finally forced to move before the road was opened to traffic . Village chief Chen Xuecai said: 'Luo Baogen received dozens of people from the media every day and his . house stands in the center of the road. So he decided to demolish the . house.' To ensure the couple’s safety, . adjacent rooms in the building had been left intact after all their . neighbours had moved out. Real estate has been a significant driver of the People's Republic of China's economic prowess in recent decades. During most of the Communist era, private ownership of property was . abolished, making it easy for residents to be moved on - but now the . laws have been tightened up and it is illegal to demolish property by . force without an agreement. Folorn: Mr Baogen looks wistfully across the new scenery, the tarmac from the new road waving haphazardly along the side of the building and demarcating the homeowner's land . Room with a view: Luo Baogen looks out on the new road - yet to be officially opened - from the apartment building where all his neighbours moved out . Thinking laterally: Unperturbed by the couple's decision to remain in the property, developers simply paved around the house . Rapid development has cost tens of thousands of objecting people their homes, as they are eventually forced out . to make way for new housing, factories and other business ventures, . creating a major source of unrest. Property . owners in China that refuse to move to make way for development are . known as 'Nail Householders' referring to a stubborn nail that is not . easy to remove from a piece of old wood and cannot be pulled out with a . hammer. Earlier this year, . Hong Chunqin, 75, and her husband Kung, who live in the two dilapidated . buildings with their two sons, had initially agreed to sell the property . in Taizhou, in Zhejiang province and accepted £8,000 in compensation. But then she changed her mind and refunded the money once work on the road had started. Isolated: Niu Chuangen and Zhang Zhongyun's home stands on a small parcel of land amid the growing skyscrapers . Earlier this year, Niu Chuangen and . Zhang Zhongyun dared to stand in the way of a local property developer . in Zaozhuang, in the Shandong province. As a result, the resolute couple, . both in their 60s, have been left stranded on their tiny spot of land, . while all around them the ground is dug up and skyscrapers erected. The distraught pair were regularly . threatened by gangsters and have had to fend over a number of attempts . to illegally demolish their ramshackle home. They were cut off from utilities in . 2009 when a local developer started the enormous earthworks involved in . building dozens of high-rise residential buildings in the area. Refuse to move: Another family initially agreed to sell the property in Taizhou but changed their minds once work on the road had started . Stranded: The couple were left without running water and electricity ground after real estate developers dug out the ground around it . Cannot demolish: During the Communist era, private ownership of property was abolished but now the laws have been tightened up and it is illegal to demolish property by force without an agreement . In another case, one family among 280 . others at the site of a six storey shopping mall being built in . Chongqing refused to leave their home for two years. Developers . cut their power and water, and excavated a 10-meter deep pit around . their home, which their family had inhabited for three generations. The . owners broke into the construction site, reoccupied it, and flew a . Chinese flag on top and then Yang Wu, a local martial arts champion, . used nunchakus to make a staircase to the house and threatened to beat . any authorities who attempted to evict him. The owners turned down an offer of £300,000 but eventually settled with the developers in 2007. High and dry: A furious family took legal action against property developers in Mianyang, south west China, last year after they demolished every staircase in their seven-storey apartment block in a bizarre bid to make them vacate their top-floor flat so they could build a factory (pictured, top, with the flower boxes and awnings) That's prime retail estate! With space at premium in the densely populated city of Zhuzhou in central China's Hunan Province, homeowners decided to build these villas on the roof of the Jiutian International Plaza shopping centre, which is home to one of most famous wholesale markets for shoes in the region . Architectural triumph or just plain pants? It has been trumpeted as 'a dramatic, iconic gateway' to the East that makes the Arc de Triomphe look like a mere ornament, but critics of he £445m Gate of the East in Suzhou, China, have likened the structure to a giant pair of long johns . Ee bah gum! Majestic, yes. But the gloss was taken off ever so slightly when Beijing's new Phoenix International Media Centre (above) was compared by some observers earlier this year to a huge Yorkshire pudding. The building boasts 65,000sqm of floor space for offices, restaurants and the headquarters of China's Phoenix TV . The world's silliest supertower?

It is 18 metres taller than the Shard in London and its closest rival is 600 miles away in Beijing. But that's because it was built in a village of 2,000 FARMERS . A touch out of place, perhaps? Near the rice paddies, groves of yellow bamboo and the homes of tens of millions of dirt-poor migrant workers lies this bizarre replica of an Alpine village in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Unsurprisingly, sales were non-existent when it opened earlier this year .","Elderly couple refused to have their home demolished, saying the compensation offered was not enough .

A new report from Children's Commissioner Dr Maggie Atkinson suggests that boys and children with special needs are more likely to be expelled from school . Children with special educational needs are still much more likely to be expelled from school than their classmates, according to the Children's Commissioner. In a new report on school exclusions, Dr Maggie Atkinson warned that there is an 'unacceptably high' link between a pupil’s background and their chances of being permanently excluded from school. It found that in 2010/11 children with special educational needs (SEN) were nine times more likely to be excluded than their classmates. And boys were three times more likely to be expelled than girls. The report also found that children from some ethnic backgrounds were more likely to be excluded than others. Gypsy, Roma and Irish traveller children were four times more likely to be expelled, and Black Caribbean pupils were three times more likely, the report found. It warns that for children who fall into more than one category, the likelihood that they will be expelled increases. In her foreword to the report, Dr Atkinson suggests that a Black Caribbean boy, who has moderate SEN and is eligible for free school meals is 168 times more likely to be expelled than a white female pupil with no SEN and from a more affluent family. She says that there are complicated reasons for this that are not limited to school. The male pupil who is more likely to be permanently excluded is more likely to have a difficult life in general, Dr Atkinson suggests. She said: 'He is more likely to be unemployed later in life, live in poor accommodation and be in trouble with the police. 'This is an issue for society as a whole, and school exclusions represent one signifier of a wider problem. 'Schools do not act in isolation, and cannot be expected unilaterally to level the playing field in terms of life outcomes for children in disadvantaged groups.' Dr Atkinson adds that some schools do a 'fantastic' job at reducing exclusions and narrowing the achievement gap. Boys are three times more likely to be expelled than girls (file picture) 'We have found that the most important single thing a school can do is to realise that some children need more support than others in school, and to meet this need. 'The best schools do this instinctively because they realise that this is core to their job, rather than an ""optional extra"",' she said. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders said: 'Heads do not want to have to permanently exclude any child, but at the end of the day they have a responsibility to all pupils in their care and they cannot allow the education or safety of the majority to be jeopardised by one or two pupils. 'Exclusion is a last resort when all other sanctions have failed. 'It is a sad fact that in some cases, exclusion is in the best interest of the child as the specialist support they so badly need is only made available when they are no longer in school. 'It is not a failure of schools to understand pupils’ cultural needs that leads to exclusion. 'Of course it is concerning that some groups of pupils are excluded more than others but this reflects deep seated issues in our society which schools alone cannot solve alone. 'A coordinated, cross-government commitment is required to tackle these enormous challenges.'","Children's Commissioner Dr Maggie Atkinson will release a report today .

Mr Tyler shot himself dead just four days later. @Dangerous and psychotic': Mark Tyler, left, shot his mother Maureen, right, dead and then killed himself four days later an inquest has heard . An inquest in Chelmsford heard how Mr Tyler had a history of drug abuse and had been for a psychiatric consultation two months before the deaths. His family say that doctors told him that he was 'dangerous and psychotic' yet still sent him back home to live with his mother and no formal diagnosis was made. Coroner for Essex and Thurrock Caroline Beasley Murray said that the lack of a diagnosis left 'nothing that helps us explain why this event took place.' She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing for Mrs Tyler and ruled that Mr Tyler took his own life. After the inquest, Mr Tyler's sister Jessie Haggar said: 'He was told he was psychotic. He was told he was dangerous but allowed to stay with my mum. Investigation: Forensics officers search Maureen Tyler's home after she was shot dead last year .

Sentenced: Gary George who has been jailed for life after he killed his friend in a scene which mirrored one of his favourite horror films . A horror film fanatic who tortured and mutilated his friend in a scene which mirrored one of his favourite movies has been jailed for life. Gary George, 41, will serve a minimum of 30 years after he tortured and mutilated Andrew Nall, 53, in a 'cruel and sadistic' attack. George beat his victim and inflicted 49 separate knife wounds, including a wound carved into his stomach which had salt poured onto it. There was also a 'creamy substance', thought to be cleaning fluid, found in Mr Nall’s eyes, the prosecution said. His body was discovered in the bedroom of his flat in Chester, on August 30 last year. After the killing George, a homeless alcoholic, went into an off-licence where he told the shop assistant: 'I’ve just killed my best mate.' He initially denied the murder but changed his plea to guilty last week as his three-week trial was coming to a close. George was obsessed with witchcraft and horror films, Chester Crown Court was told. He . 'particularly' liked to watch The Loved Ones, a 2009 Australian film in . which an attack takes place with 'chilling similarity' to the death of . Mr Nall. Passing sentence today Judge Elgan Edwards said: 'This was a cruel and vicious attack. 'It was also a sadistic attack. 'I am satisfied that in behaving in the way you did, you were aping the conduct in a film of which you were obsessed, namely The Loved Ones.' The judge said he and the jury had had 'the misfortune' of watching the movie’s murder sequence during the trial and added: 'I regret to say that, as in this film, you committed many acts while the unfortunate Mr Nall was still alive. 'And that included the substance in his eyes, be that cleaning fluid, and the carving of marks upon his chest.' George showed no emotion as his sentence was passed. The judge described Mr Nall, also an alcoholic, as 'vulnerable'. He added: 'He was vulnerable because of the amount of drink he had taken. 'You knew he had, you took advantage of it and, putting it in a nutshell, he was no match for you. 'You killed him in a most cruel and sadistic way and you enjoyed doing so.' In an emotional victim impact statement, which was read to the court, Mr Nall’s sister Fiona Hall said the family had been left 'reeling' by his death. Victim: Andrew Nall was beaten and stabbed in what a judge today described as a 'cruel and sadistic' attack in August last year . Her statement said: 'Never did any of his family expect to have to deal with the aftermath of such a heinous crime.' She said her brother, a former supermarket worker, had 'struggled' with alcohol for many years but was determined to turn his life around. Mrs Hall added: 'Andrew was kind, considerate and would help others without a second thought. 'He was an engaging conversationalist, with a strong intellect and a quick wit. 'Those close to him are broken-hearted by their loss.' She recalled what would have been his birthday earlier this month, when the trial watched a 'shocking' video of his 'mutilated body lying in his own bedroom where he should have been safe'. 'Andrew was kind was an engaging conversationalist, with a strong intellect and a quick wit.Those close to him are broken-hearted by their loss.' Fiona Hall, Andrew Nall's sister . Mrs Hall added: '(It was) a wholly undignified end indeed to a life cut short at the hands of someone to whom he had extended the hand of friendship.' The family made no comment following today’s hearing. George was also sentenced to 12 years today, concurrent to the life term, for a second attack 10 hours after the murder of Mr Nall. The court heard he broke a bottle and slashed the hand and head of a man in an attack which the judge said 'caused the most awful injuries to his victim.' He was caught by police following that attack. In police interviews he admitted killing someone but falsely alleged that his victim was a paedophile and rapist. George’s co-defendant, Christine Holleran, 50, was cleared of murder and manslaughter by the jury on Friday. Holleran, who told the jury she witnessed the attack but played no part in it, shouted “justice, justice” as their majority verdict was returned. Giving evidence, she said George was growling as he stabbed Mr Nall, and said: “He was like the devil.” Hearing: Gary George was jailed for life at Chester Crown Court today . She said she then ran away from Mr Nall’s flat 'in a state of shock'. In a statement released by Cheshire Police, Mr Nall’s family said: 'Andrew was brutally murdered by a man whom he invited into his home. 'He would have had no idea that Gary George was a sadistic bully capable of the most extreme violence. 'The cruel and callous way in which Andrew died leaves us unable to feel anything other than utter contempt for his killer. 'He took the life of a kind and caring man attempting to justify his actions by making untrue and wicked allegations that cast aspersions on his victim’s character. 'The lengthy sentence imposed reflects the gravity of his crimes which gives us some consolation. 'Seven months on our collective grief is still immense. Copycat: The court heard how George was a fan of the 2009 Australian film The Loved Ones (pictured) and that his killing of Andrew Nall was similar to a murder scene in it . 'The trial has been a harrowing experience for everybody, especially those who loved Andrew - he has gone from our lives but lives on in our hearts.' Detective Sergeant Andrew Paine, of Chester CID, added: 'This was a challenging investigation from the outset as only Holleran and George know exactly what went on in the flat on the night Andrew Nall was killed. 'Through painstaking inquiries we have pieced together the events leading up to Andrew’s death and the later assault which show that neither victim did anything to provoke the horrific attacks which followed. 'My sympathies go out in particular to the family of Andrew Nall and I hope the verdict goes some way towards bringing closure for them.'","Gary George was jailed for killing Andrew Nall at Chester Crown Court .

Miles Haslam, who owned his own practice but was Bupa registered, is said to have asked the patient whether she 'liked' a shoulder massage he performed on her during one of four sessions. The allegations came to light in 2011 after a friend of the victim, named only as Patient A, mentioned similar concerns, prompting her to complain to Bupa about the sessions with Haslam in August and September 2008. Sophie Lister representing the Health and Care Professions Council (HPC) said: 'Patient A reported that she she stopped attending sessions with Mr Haslam because he behaved inappropriately. 'He had undone her bra, slapped her on the bottom and talked about pornography in the sessions. 'A friend of Patient A mentioned similar concerns to her, which compelled Patient A to complain.' A letter was sent to Tracey-Ann Fletcher, customer services director at Bupa, which mentioned how Haslam would undo patient A's bra strap and do it back up without asking. The hearing heard that the 'last straw' for the patient was when Haslam massaged her shoulders and asked if she liked it. Ms Lister said: 'Bupa wrote to Mr Haslam to outline the complaint on 28 February 2012 and Tracey-Ann Fletcher spoke to him. 'Mr Haslam did ask if the matter could be internal.'

It's been five decades since Britain said goodbye to said of its most beautiful and picturesque railway stations as the nation began to scale back its vast train network in a move that would see more than 2,000 stations closed. Dr Richard Beeching's report on the state of the railways saw the network scaled back by around a third and stations in rural beauty spots up and down the country lost forever. This collection of images show the very last journeys made by locomotives on dozens of rural lines across the country before they were ripped up under the Beeching Axe.

The . anniversary comes at a time when the many of the derelict lines, most . of them in remote rural locations, are enjoying something of a revival. Over . the last 30 years enthusiasts and volunteers have worked to reopen some . of the axed lines and have turned them into successful tourist . attractions, such as the Swanage Railway in Dorset. Many coastal routes such as the Dorset Express (pictured in May 1967) were axed by Dr Beeching in his cuts t to rail services . One of the last trains on the Hayling Island branch line was pictured at sunset in November 1963 . One of the last trains on Bath Green to Bournemouth line is watched by enthusiasts in March 1966 . Now numerous local authorities are . looking into the prospect of doing the same to relieve congestion on the . roads and restore public transport. At . the time of the infamous report 'The Reshaping of British Railways' by . Dr Richard Beeching, the chairman of the British Railways, motorways . were being built across the country at a rapid rate and the car was seen . as the future. But, due to today's record costs of running a car, public transport has never been in more demand. Julian . Holland, the author of the 'Dr Beeching's Axe' book said: ‘The book is . meant to be a memorial to all that was lost and I have tried to record . all the lines that were closed. Protestors blocked the line at Newcastleton to fight against closures and Liberal Democrat MP David Steel tried to restore order . Dr Richard Beeching oversaw the closures of thousands of railways in the 1960s to the dismay of passengers and rail staff. The last train from Horwich to Bolton was decorated with a wreath in September 1965 . The Southbound Pine Express from Bath Green Park (pictured in September 1961) was one of the services to be cut under Beeching's Axe . ‘But there is a serious point to it in . that a lot of the closures under the Beeching Axe weren't really . necessary and many of them are now needed more than ever. ‘The first motorway was built in 1959 and the car was the future and the railways were costing too much to run. ‘But the survey of the British railways that formed the report was pretty outrageous - it was flawed. ‘The . survey took place in just one week in April 1961 and a third of the . route that was surveyed carried only one per cent of passenger and . freight traffic. ‘It didn't take into account seasonal traffic flows to the seaside for example. ‘Most of the lines that were closed were in remote rural areas like in mid-Wales and northern England. Dr Richard Beeching's report saw some 2,128 railway stations closed across Britain, with 650 lines of railway ripped up in Scotland alone and many of the nation's towns left without direct access to train services. One of the largest lines to close was the Waverley route from Edinburgh to Carlisle. The closure left the Scottish borders the only area of Britain without a railway line and left the town of Hawick, with a population of some 16,000 at the time, the furthest town away from a station. Rail passengers from the Scottish Borders town would have to travel either 42 miles to Carlisle or 56 miles to Edinburgh to catch a train. Beeching Maps.jpg . But Hawick was not the only town in Britain with a population exceeding 10,000 left without a station. Some of the biggest and most well known towns in Britain whose stations were closed after the Beeching report include: . For a full list of line closures following the Beecham Report click here.

Richard Beeching, pictured travelling by rail and shaking a rail worker's hand oversaw closures of more than 2,000 stations . ‘Seaside lines such as Minehead in Somerset and Ilfracombe in Devon suffered the most and with no through trains from London, people just stopped going there. ‘The railways might have been expensive to run in the 1950s and '60s but it was still cheaper than it is today. ‘In real terms the cost to the taxpayer in 1961 was £1.6billion but today the privatised railways are subsidised to the tune of £3.5billion. ‘The decision to deatroy 4,500 route miles of railway, 2,500 stations and 67,700 jobs in 1963 was short-sighted. ‘Many of these lines are needed today. Rail passenger numbers are increasing today because the car is becoming so expensive to run and because of the level of congestion on our roads.’ Locals in Swanage have relaid 1,700 rails and 22,000 sleepers and the first passenger train for 37 years will depart from Victoria to the south coast resort .

Dr Richard Beeching, Chairman of the British Railways Board holding The Reshaping of British Railways report . British Rail was losing £140m a year when Dr Richard Beeching took over as chairman of the British Transport Commission. His solution, announced on 27 March 1963, was to 'make railways pay'. Dr Beeching wrote two reports proposing cuts to British Railway services. The first was entitled The Reshaping of British Railways and published in 1963. It was based on a survey carried out over one week in . April 1961. A third of the route surveyed carried only one . per cent of passenger and freight traffic. The second report in 1965 was called The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes. The . first report suggested that 2,363 stations and 5,000 miles of railway . line should be closed - accounting for 55 per cent of stations and 30 . per cent of route miles. The Conservative government welcomed the report, but British people living in rural areas were against the plans. Following the reports 2,128 stations and more than 67,000 British . Rail jobs were cut. More than 4,500 miles of track was lost.

Mother Jo leads the way losing a massive 7st 12lbs, husband Tony shed 7st 6lbs, Tanyatrimmed down by 4st 2lbs and Anmarie by 2st 12lbs. Big slimmers: The Dornan have lost a massive 21 stone between them after deciding to fight the flab together - in time for a big wedding. Pictured from left are, Tanya Dornan, Tony Dornan, Jo Dornan and Anmarie Williams . The family lifestyle overhaul was sparked by Tanya after Anmarie asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. And after ditching junk food and exercising, the new family are healthier and happier than they have ever been. Tanya - who was a size 18 weighing more than 13 stone - was embarrassed at the prospect of facing the cameras on her sister's big day. She said: 'I’d been a bridesmaid before and I was massive because my daughter was only 11 months old at the time. 'When Anmarie asked me to be her bridesmaid I didn’t want to see pictures of me at that size again. 'I haven't got any pictures of me at my biggest because I hated having my picture taken. 'But I didn’t want to be scared of the camera at my sister's wedding.' Slimfest: The family slimfest was sparked by Tanya after Anmarie asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding . When Tanya joined a Slimming World class her 20-stone mum Jo and Anmarie, almost 12 stone, went along as well. The whole family, from Fairwater, Cardiff, cut out junk food, went on a healthy diet. And 24 stone club steward dad Tony joined in the family fighting the flab before the wedding last September. Tanya said: 'I had been a fat bridesmaid before and wore a size 18 dress. I remember having two dresses sewn together to fit me! 'I started my diet on 14 March 2011 and got to my first target a week before my sister's wedding.

Happy: After cutting out junk food, the family are now happier and healthier than ever before . 'I manage to rope my family into my diet and soon we were all losing weight.' Mother-of-four Jo, 53, said: 'Weight piled on when I started having children and I gradually got bigger and bigger until it was out of control. 'Trying to balance life and everything when the kids were little and trying to cook decent meals - sometimes you have to resort to fast food.' Jo, a stewardess at the same social club as her husband, said: 'We would finish work and get a takeaway. 'I got bigger and bigger and my health was poor and something had to be done, .

It’s good when people comment on how good she looks because I get a bit of a buzz.' The girls say that seeing how happy their mother since joining Slimming World has made it all worth it. Jo said: 'I feel absolutely fantastic, like a different person. I’m more confident, I feel like I did when I was a teenager. We all live a much healthier lifestyle.

For many ardent shoppers, half the fun of hitting their favourite stores is casually browsing what's on offer and looking around for a bargain. But don't expect a warm welcome if you're not planning on buying anything from one Australian store - not only will you leave empty handed but also out of pocket. The Celiac Supplies store in Brisbane has sparked outrage by charging customers a $5 'just looking' fee. The shop, which specialises in Gluten and diary free food as well as supplies for diabetics, started charging browsers back in February in a bid to stop customers using the store as a 'reference point' and then buying goods elsewhere, according to the Huffington Post. Controversial: A typed note informing customers that they will have to pay a charge for browsing in a store in Brisbane, Australia . A note in the door of the shop, which has since been posted on Reddit, explains that customers will be given their $5 dollars back when they make a purchase. It reads: 'There has been high volume of people who use this store as a reference point and then purchase goods elsewhere. 'These people are unaware our prices are almost the same as the other stores plus we have products simply not available anywhere else.' The owner of the store, named in reports only as Georgina, claims that the policy is in line with other clothing, shoe and electronic stores facing the same issues with customers not buying items. And if an American study carried out by the International Business Machines Corp which found in January that nearly 50 per cent of US online purchases were browsed in stores first, Georgina may have a point. Shopkeeper Georgina told the Brisbane Times: 'It's not my own idea, I have heard of other shops doing it, but they haven't put a sign up at the front door. Mark Galpin has put up a sign outside the front door of his furniture and antiques shop in Christchurch, Dorset, which reads in bold letters 'No Tourists' 'I have to wake people up, everything in life is not free. 'I don't want to take the job of a dietician, I don't want to take the job of a naturopath or a nutritionist, but people are expecting freebies all the time and when you say 'hey, you're costing me time and effort', they don't like the idea of paying.' The charge echoes the policy of UK shopkeeper Mark Galpin who banned tourists living outside a 30 mile radius from entering his Aladdin's Cave antiques store in Christchurch, Dorset. He introduced the ban after becoming fed up with 'time wasting' tourists browsing his store while waiting for their bus home. While footfall at the store is said to have dropped around 90 per cent, Mr Galpin says that he is making more money since he introduced the ban.","Celiac Supplies in Brisbane has been charging customers since February .

From the crisp, snow clad mountains to vivid bright blue seas, these breath-taking photographs capture the raw and arresting beauty of the natural landscape. With subjects ranging from the morning sunrise to the dazzling night sky, the images - all of which were taken in France and Italy - catch these calm and tranquil settings in all their glory. Taken by photographer Alessio Andreani, 24, they depict different moods for each shot, alternating from the bright and cheerful greenery of Italy to the crashing waves in the south of France. This picture, showing the Sibillini Mountains in Italy, was taken by photographer Alessio Andreani as part of a series of landscape shots taken throughout France and Italy . The awe-inspiring shots, taken throughout 2012, also manage to display the changing colours of the mountains and lakes, from oranges to yellows and purples to blues. Mr Andreani, 25, who is from Italy, says he feels a 'strong link with the land where I live'. He added: 'The sun has a massive impact on how the photographs will turn out; it is like one big flame of light. 'Whilst photographing a lot of these images, I had only a few seconds to get the exact capture I needed, as the sun moves so quickly at sunrise.' The stunning photographs of greenery were taken in the town of Castelluccio di Norcia and in the hills near Recanati in Italy, showing the landscape off to its best advantage. Mr Andreani, who was born in Loreto, said: 'Taking these photographs of the vast countryside was very relaxing for me; I was able to just walk and enjoy the moment.' This picture, which Mr Andreani calls Pink Moonrise, shows the moon coming up behind Mount Redentore in Castelluccio di Norcia, Italy, giving the clouds a pink light . In this shot, called Light and Ice, the composition highlights the cold ice in the foreground with the warm, peach-coloured light cast by the sun on Italian mountains . This picture, called Dreaming, captures early morning clouds flowing across rocks in Tellaro, La Spezia, in the Liguria region of Italy . This picture on the left shows a meteor shower in Italy, while the one on the right, taken at Mount Argentella, Italy, contrasts the bright tent with the dazzling night sky . This picture is called Reflections and was taken in the Passetto beach area of the Italian town of Ancona, where the sun peeped through the clouds and lit up the sky . The images of the calm and eerie night sky were also taken in Italy in Mount Argentella and capture the Milky Way above the same town. Mr Andreani added: 'It was very quiet during the taking of these photographs, and because there was no moon, there were only the stars to light up the sky, making it seem so dark.' In stark contrast to the pictures taken at night are the shots showing the precise moments of sunrise, which were taken at various places including Monte Conero and Tellaro in Italy, and Cannes in France. In this photograph, entitled Blowing, a meadow of wild flowers is seeing blowing in the breeze, in contrast to the serene mountains of Castelluccio di Norcia, Italy, behind . Here, sunrise in Cannes, in the south of France is the subject for the photograph, which Alessio Adreani has called Red Rocks . In another shot taken in the south of France, this image of sunrise at Cap d'Antibes shows the spume of the sea blurring where the water meets the rocks . They show how the water of the sea and rivers appears to be illuminated in varying shades of blue as the sun rises above. Meanwhile, the snow and ice demonstrate the contrast between the stone cold land, while the bright sun continues to glow and light up the surrounding mountains. Mr Andreani said: 'I was really impressed by the colours of the water and the ice in these shots, they changed within seconds and I was lucky enough to experience it right in front of me.' This beautifully detailed photograph, entitled Tree, was taken in the rolling hills of Castelluccio di Norcia in Mr Andreani's native Italy . This image, taken in Mount Argentella, Italy, and entitled Viewpoint on the Galaxy, is taken at a height of 2,000m and shows light pollution from far away cities . Taken at Dramont on the French Riviera, this image is called The Tower and shows a storm making its way towards the photographer, far beyond a placid rockpool . This photograph, called Climb Over The Mountain, was taken in Castelluccio di Norcia, Italy, one hot day last summer . Called Warm, this shot was taken in Ancona, Italy, and shows a warm sunrise lighting up the morning sky over the grey sea . This picture, aptly entitled Blue and Green, was taken in Tellaro, La Spezia, in Italy and shows the dazzling colours provided by the land and the sea . This picture, called Triangle, shows the very last of the day's light touching the peak of Mount Redentore in Italy . The title of this picture, Wind, is explained by the blurred wild grasses in the foreground as they are tossed by the breeze sweeping across Castelluccio di Norcia . This image, Sunrise In The Bay, was taken in Ancona, Italy, and shows water foaming around the reefs and the pink sun touching the cliffs . This shot, entitled Fleeting, shows everyone's dream of an Italian rural landscape and was taken in the hills near Recanati . This image,called Golfo dei Poeti (Gulf Of The Poets), was taken in Lerici, in La Spezia, Italy, and shows waves crashing against the rocks as the sun goes down . This image, called Storm Is Moving, highlights the contrast between the black of the storm clouds and the brilliant bright orange of the sunrise above Portonovo, Italy . The vividness of the colours in the sky and sea make this photograph, entitled Flowing Sunrise, which Mr Andreani took with a seven-minute exposure in Liguria .

When zero noodles were unveiled recently an army of . health-conscious dieters were quick to snap them up - many going as far as describing the eight-calorie-per-portion food as the 'Holy Grail' of dieting. But now, experts claim they have created a 'revolutionary' weight loss approach that is set to knock zero noodles to the back of the shelf. New weight loss craze: Experts are claiming that Slimsticks are the latest diet craze, but are they really a healthy way to shed the pounds? Slimsticks, a new weight loss drink, has been likened to a 'gastric band in a glass', due to the drink’s  hunger busting properties. Experts are raving about the 40 calorie drink because of what they claim to be a 'miracle ingredient' within it. This magic supplement, called Konjac, . is an ingredient that expands in the stomach to provide an instant . feeling of fullness and desperate dieters are turning to Slimsticks as a last ditch attempt before enduring expensive surgery. Konjac, . a natural ingredient derived from a plant native to Asia and palm oil . and oat oil, supposedly provides a long lasting feeling of fullness. Supported by numerous clinical . studies, Konjac provides a physical reaction in the stomach making the eater . feel full very quickly, then after 3-4 hours the palm oil and oat oil . get to work, fooling the brain and body into thinking there’s still fat . to digest, which prevents the hunger signals that normally see us . reaching for snacks in between meals. 'Miracle' ingredient: The new product maintains that it's the new zero noodle because it claims to contain a 'miracle' ingredient that expands in your stomach . Available in Strawberry, Vanilla and Double Malt, each sachet has to be mixed with water and drunk three times a day before . meals. The sachets are sold at Boots for £24.99 and have seen a predictably huge response. But is is this 'miracle' drink too good to be true? Personal . trainer and nutritionist Jenny Dawes, who has worked with the likes of . Ulrika Jonsson, said: 'This is just another high fibre ""quick fix"" product which claims to make the stomach feel full quickly. 'There . appears to be no stimulants and the side effects can cause flatulence . and mild irregularity especially if you are not use to a high fibre . diet. 'If the appetite is reduced and . insufficient energy calories are cut then exercise - which is the best . way to permanently lose weight and keep healthy - may not be performed . due to reduced energy levels. 'Personally . rather than ""sitting in the chair"" drinking ""quick fix"" products, which . will not increase your lean body tissue muscle, why not get up and . exercise go for a power walk, jog or run, which will lead to a healthier . body and stronger mind which will permanently keep your body and mind . healthy without any 'smelly 'odours'. Simple!' 'People . turn to such things because they want a quick fix but its long term . properties are unknown and unlikely to be good. Slim sticks that provide . a 'physical reaction in the stomach' are tricking our body it's long . term health benefits will not be good. 'Slim . sticks are a craze, they will not sustain a healthy lifestyle. If you . want to lose weight, do it gradually and with the right guidance,' added .

Sentencing Badea at Southwark Crown Court, Judge David Higgins . described the attack as an 'act of vengeance' which was 'premeditated' and 'sustained'. He said that the attack on Miss Ciobataru was designed to 'maximise . the pain suffering and loss of amenity which the complainent would . suffer.' He added: 'She harboured a grudge and decided to exact revenge. 'I am wholly satisfied that there is no remorse. She has achieved exactly what she set out to achieve.' Badea admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm but denied the . premeditation, ferocity, and length of the attack - meaning the judge . had to make a ruling of fact. Miss Ciobotaru, who no longer works at the club, told the court that Badea was angry that she was taking her customers. Both women worked at the French Pussycat club in Soho at the time of the attack in February . She said: 'She told me she was going to wait for me outside. She said she would punch me.' During the heated exchange on February 7 last year in the strippers' changing room at the Walker's Court club, Badea screamed 'You f***ing . bitch, I will wait for you and then I will look after you.' Frightened Miss Ciobotaru told the club manager who offered to walk her home. But she and a fellow stripper went for dinner at a nearby Lebanese . restaurant. Badea, described in court as a 'habitual liar' followed her . to the restaurant and then waited for her outside. She confronted her on Shaftesbury Avenue and punched her on the bridge . of the nose, causing her to blackout for a couple of seconds. As the dancer walked away and called police, Badea snatched her phone - telling her: 'Police won’t do anything. I am a woman.' She then grabbed her hair, pulled her head back, and headbutted her, . hitting the bridge of her nose again. Miss Ciobotaru fell to the floor . as Badea kneed her in the stomach before running away.

But the judge ruled she presented a 'tissue of lies designed to reduce . her culpability' and even if Miss Ciobotaru had used such language it . would not have justified the 'extreme violence' used against her.

'Back . in 2010, the ideas behind a squid's sticky tendrils and Spider-Man's . super-strong webbing were combined to create a prototype for the first . remote device able to stop vehicles in their tracks,' the US Department of Homeland Security said. Today it revealed the latest version of the technology. 'The Pit-Ballistic Undercarriage Lanyard (Pit-Bul) essentially is a tricked out speed bump,' it said. 'Hidden inside is a set of spikes attached to a net. 'When deployed, the spikes puncture the tyres and the net tangles in the car's axles.' Made of panels that easily slot together, it can be set up for single or double lane coverage, and police can trigger it from nearby. 'If a driver blows through a . checkpoint, the agent can press a button and the car's tires are spiked . and netted in milliseconds,' said Mark Kaczmarek, the SQUID program . manager in S&T's Borders and Maritime Security Division. 'No . high-speed pursuit is needed, and no one's life is put at risk.' In action: Spikes puncture the truck's tyres, while the nets wrap themselves around the car's front axle . The spikes pop up and puncture the tyre, and also hold the net so it is deployed around the wheel . The system can easily be taken apart and put together at the roadside . The system can also be used unattended, for instance on a private driveway. If somebody crashes through a gate . when no officers are on duty, a sensor activates the Pit-Bul to . deploy. The gate crasher is stopped on the spot.' The team also revealed a 'spike strip' which is contained in a . suitcase and can be remotely triggered to deploy the spikes across the . road. Currently, spike strips are placed by hand in the fleeing driver's . path, usually at the last second so as not to impede other traffic. The NightHawk is placed on the roadside and does not require an officer to stand nearby to deploy the device. The developers say the system will work on everything from a compact car to an SUV at speeds of up to 40mph . 'Traditional methods of deploying spike strips by hand in the path of . a fleeing driver can put an officer's life in danger, and are not . always effective,' Martínez said. 'When an officer is radioed that a fleeing vehicle is approaching, . they can quickly place NightHawk on the side of the road and move a safe . distance away. 'When the target vehicle approaches, before the driver has a chance . to react, the officer can remotely trigger the spiked arm to deploy . across the street and puncture the vehicle's tyres.'","Developed by US Department of Homeland Security, could be used by police forces around the world .

Racehorses have better lives than some children, according to a jockey tipped to win the Grand National this weekend. Katie Walsh, due to ride second favourite Seabass in Saturday’s meeting, was defending the race against those who label it barbaric. Two horses, including the favourite Synchronised, died in last year's running at Aintree. Since then further welfare changes, including a new fence design, have been made. Katie Walsh was defending the Grand National against those who say it is barbaric . Walsh came third in last year's Aintree meeting and is one of the favourites to win on Saturday . However, Walsh believes that horse deaths should be put in perspective when compared to the fall that left Irish jockey JT McNamara paralysed at the Cheltenham Festival last month. Walsh, whose brother Ruby will ride favourite On His Own, said: ‘Anyone who gets up on Christmas Day and mucks out loves animals. Sure, it’s a dangerous sport but every night, all over the world, a lot of horses are left out in fields starving. JT McNamara was left paralysed after he fell from his horse at Cheltenham Festival . ‘These horses are so well looked after. Better than some children, to be honest with you. ‘I don’t read the criticism because it’s not worth it. At the end of the day it would be a lot worse if it had been two jockeys who lost their lives. I think everyone should remember that.’ In an interview with Radio Times, Walsh added: ‘I hope to God there are no accidents this year, but these things happen, and they’re horses at the end of the day. ‘I don’t mean that in a cruel way, but to see John Thomas McNamara get a horrible fall at Cheltenham… he’s gone from the neck down, and that’s a different deal altogether in my eyes.’ Claude Knights, the director of welfare charity Kidscape, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Obviously we have a duty of care to look after animals but it doesn't compare to the duty of care we have for our children. 'Racehorses, while not exploited, are still tools that are being used for commercial use. 'When . children are used in the same way, on shows like the X Factor, when . their emotions are seen very publicly , the consequences are not very . pleasant. I don't think making comparisons help either cause.' Walsh . achieved the best Grand National finish for a female jockey when third . last year on Seabass, a horse trained by her father Ted. Changes . to the course by Aintree bosses include replacing the solid wood cores . of all fences with plastic or birch, which is softer on the horse and . moving the race starting point away from the noise of the grandstand to . stop the horses getting overwhelmed. Chance: Katie Walsh will team up with Seabass for Saturday's famous race . The racecard order of the horses will be arranged in the parade ring instead of in front of spectators in the stands. Security is also being reviewed by police, who fear extreme animal rights groups may try to disrupt the meeting. There are peaceful protests planned by Animal Aid and Fight Against Animal Cruelty in Europe.","Katie Walsh defended the race against those who say it is barbaric .
