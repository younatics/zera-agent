"(CNN) -- The picture says it all. Curtis D. Tucker was thrilled to receive a Farrah Fawcett poster for his 14th birthday in 1976. The shot of 14-year-old Curtis D. Tucker shows him unrolling one of his birthday treasures in 1976, mouth slightly agape and eyes intensely focused on the gift. The present was one he had fervently requested from his parents and a hot item for many a young, red-blooded male during that bicentennial year: a poster of Farrah Fawcett (then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors). ""I was a huge Farrah fan,"" said Tucker, now a cartoonist and entrepreneur living in Enid, Oklahoma. ""I had started collecting all of the magazines and pictures and I was basically pinning up every picture that came out of every magazine. Then along came that poster."" ""That poster"" reportedly became the best-selling of all time -- with more than 12 million copies sold -- and helped make Fawcett one of the last great pinups. A private funeral is scheduled Tuesday at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles, California, for the actress who died at the age of 62 from cancer. With her famously thick blond hair, red swimsuit, and smile as big and bright as the California sun, the actress was the epitome of the wholesome, all-American girl. ""She was full of life and so happy with that blond hair and that huge smile,"" said Tucker, who isn't sure if he still has the poster in his attic. ""Without that poster, I don't think she would have become what she was."" That freshness and beauty is what landed her poster on Tucker's, and countless others', bedroom walls. Maria Elena Buszek, the author of ""Pin-up Grrrls: Feminism, Sexuality, Popular Culture,"" said pinups ""straddled the line between portraiture and pornography"" and included early stage actresses, the famed models of Alberto Vargas and the most famous pinup of all, Bettie Page. Fawcett has her place in pinup history, said Buszek, an assistant professor of art history at Kansas City Art Institute, School of Liberal Arts. ""The Farrah Fawcett poster really is one of the last iconic pinup images of the 20th century,"" Buszek said. ""By the 1970s, because of the sexual revolution and mores about sexuality becoming looser in the west, the pinup does start to become more nostalgic."" When the photo was taken, Fawcett had not yet become one of ""Charlie's Angels,"" the role which helped make her a star. She was instead better known for her commercials and ads, most notably -- and not surprisingly -- for Wella Balsam shampoo. Photographer Bruce McBroom shot the now iconic image and told Entertainment Weekly that the starlet was at the time a young innocent from Texas who did her own hair and makeup for the shoot. ""She had no idea of how beautiful and how attractive she was, I'm sure,"" McBroom recalled. ""She was just like apple-pie, girl-next-door kind of girl, and in all the years I knew her she never changed."" Now Fawcett's image, which was considered racy at the time, is a huge part of nostalgia. Ken Leicht, a manager of Hollywood Book and Poster Company in Los Angeles, said that before Fawcett's death, the poster was most in demand from production companies looking to stage the 1970s. ""That poster, that shot of her, is just one of the definitive images of that time,"" Leicht said. ""Most of the time with the posters, the teen girls are driving the market, and Farrah is probably one of the last ones that was for the guys."" Leicht said actresses today, with the exception of a few like Pamela Anderson, don't really opt to market themselves using posters anymore. iReport.com: Share your memories of Fawcett . Matt Delzell, group account director for marketing and promotions agency The Marketing Arm, said that eventually the pinup transitioned more into supermodel pictures with the likes of Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and Elle MacPherson, as well as the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Fawcett had the crossover appeal that went beyond just being a model, Delzell said. ""The poster came along at a time when posters were popular and she had the right photographer and took the right photo,"" Delzell said. iReport.com: Fawcett's hairstyle was in high demand . It certainly was the right shot for cartoonist Curtis D. Tucker. He wasn't a big fan of ""Charlie's Angels,"" he said, so he wasn't that distressed when Fawcett left after only a year. After all, he was still able to keep her close. ""The poster was something you had at home that you could look at every day,"" said Tucker, who kept the image up for several years. ""I collected a few other pictures of some of the other Angels, but there wasn't anybody else after Farrah. She was the last.""","Iconic poster of Farrah Fawcett reportedly best-selling of all time .

"Munich, Germany (CNN) -- A story focused on the care of prison inmates with dementia in U.S. jails has scooped two top prizes at the CNN Journalist Awards ceremony in Munich. Claas Relotius was named CNN Journalist of the Year for the story ""Murderers as Carers."" The story, first published in Swiss magazine Reportagen, also won the Print category award on Thursday night. According to Relotius' report, many U.S. prisons are struggling to provide care for long-term inmates suffering from dementia. But one high-security facility has found an unconventional solution to the problem -- by teaching its own inmates to become carers. ""The report takes a poetic and interesting approach to a major social problem. Claas Relotius paints pictures in the reader's mind that unfold like a film,' said Franz Fischlin, chairman of the judging panel. See all nominees here . Meanwhile, Michael Strompen and Jo Schuck's ""Escape to the Caribbean -- Corporate Tax Tricks,"" in which they conducted an in-depth international investigation into corporate tax evasion through shell companies, won the best TV category. Jurors noted how the duo from ZDF succeeded in powerfully ""explaining the many numbers, pieces of information and complicated economic interrelations."" The Online category honors went to Christian Werner for ""On the Trail of Dead Children."" Presented on the Der Spiegel iPad app, he revealed the impact of the bombing of Iraq in 2003 on the health of children. Watch video of the CNN Journalists of the Year award (German) Also recognized was Jenny Marrenback, who won the accolade of best Radio piece. Her report, ""Haiti Cherie. The Business of Aid,"" explored the aftermath of environmental devastation in Haiti for survivors. Judges praised Marrenbach's work for showcasing ""the other side of the coin in the NGO business."" First appearing in emerge, an online magazine for young photojournalists, Birte Kaufmann's series of photographs chronicling the everyday lives of Ireland's traveler community, won top honors in the Photo category. ""Birte Kaufmann provides an intimite and deep insight into a totally foreign world,"" said the awards panel. Parisa Khosravi, senior vice president for CNN Worldwide said: ""CNN continues to do its part to support quality journalism by sharing our experience with journalism colleagues around the world through a number of different programs, such as the CNN Journalist Award, now in its ninth year.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's trip to Saudi Arabia this week comes amid accusations the State Department has hidden the results of a study that concludes textbooks in the Kingdom remain rife with Islamic extremism. Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, successive U.S. administrations have attempted to curb Saudi indoctrination of students through hateful extremist material in its textbooks. In addition to teaching the material to its own students, Saudi Arabia runs academies in about 20 countries, which use some of the same texts. The Kingdom has repeatedly claimed that it has revised its textbooks. In 2005, the Saudi government took out a full-page ad in the New Republic to boast of its success at ""having modernized our school curricula to better prepare our children for the challenges of tomorrow."" But the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said on Tuesday the secret study finds Saudi textbooks still ""create a climate that fosters exclusivity, intolerance, and calls to violence that put religious and ethnic minorities at risk."" Citing sources familiar with it, the Washington-based think tank said the Obama administration decided not to publish the study when it was completed in late 2012 because offensive material dehumanizing Jews and Christians included in the textbooks would portray the Saudis in a negative light. ""The State Department is in possession of a uniquely exhaustive set of recent findings about incitement in Saudi Arabia's education system, findings that it has declined to release for public consumption,"" the report said. The study is the product of a reported $500,000 State Department contract with the International Center for Religion and Diplomacy. On its website, ICRD says the project was commissioned to ""assist in the ongoing effort by Saudi Arabia to remove discriminatory content from its public school curriculums and to evaluate its global impact in other Muslim-majority countries."" Current and former U.S. officials said the study paints a mixed picture of Saudi textbooks. While it notes some progress by Saudis in making reforms and removing some of the most hateful language, the study still found areas for improvement. ""We know there's more work to be done,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Ali Ahmed, a Saudi scholar who runs the Washington-based Institute for Gulf Affairs, has been studying Saudi textbooks since before the 9/11 attacks. Ahmed said that in meetings with State Department officials over the years, he has found a consistent reluctance to put pressure on the Saudi royal family about the problem. ""I wrote papers and offered advice. I provided them with the textbooks showing evidence that the Saudis have not done anything,"" he said, adding that several officials warned him his campaign could damage U.S.-Saudi relations. ""The U.S. confronts China and Russia about human rights, but I don't know why they can't tell the Saudis to clean up their act on this issue,"" he said. ""The U.S. is not a small country like Panama with no tools to force change. So either they are not serious or their policy is a failure here. If the U.S. wanted to bring some pressure, they can. They have not tried."" Harf said the United States has consistently and publicly encouraged Saudi Arabia to institute educational and textbook reforms, but disputed the notion that the State Department had ever planned to publish the study. ""It was intended to drive and inform the work of the State Department as we work with the Saudi government to push them to reform their textbooks,"" Harf said. ""We obviously continue to push our partners to reform, and we believe with the Saudis that it's most effective to do this directly, with them, between our governments, and not publicly, and we do want to keep working with them to see if they can reform their curriculum more."" David Andrew Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who wrote the study, said Saudi teachings of intolerance should be on the agenda when Obama visits the Kingdom this week. ""The hate speech so rampant in Saudi textbooks should be publicly addressed by the President while in Riyadh,"" Weinberg said. ""Doing so would put hardliners on notice that even at this low point in U.S.-Saudi relations, the President will not shy away from affirming pluralistic American values and seeking reforms in the name of our national security.""

"(CNN) -- Iraqis in Diyala province sarcastically call it ""the whale."" A new report says a half-built prison in Khan Bani Saad, Iraq, will probably never be used. The ""skeletal, half-built"" shell of a maximum-security prison in Khan Bani Saad ""will probably never house an inmate"" even though the United States spent $40 million on the now-halted $73 million project. Marred by ""poor security and weak subcontractor performance,"" the project is among several examples of Iraqi rebuilding problems cited in a just-published history by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Titled ""Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience,"" the report says the massive reconstruction initiative was marked by waste and failures caused by ""blinkered and disjointed"" pre-war planning -- and was pursued amid deteriorating security. ""Why was an extensive rebuilding plan carried out in a gravely unstable security environment? asked Stuart W. Bowen Jr., the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, whose oversight jurisdiction covers $50 billion in U.S. funds appropriated by Congress for Iraq. ""This question underscores an overarching hard lesson from Iraq: Beware of pursuing large-scale reconstruction programs while significant conflict continues."" The report, released Monday, comes at a much less violent stage of the Iraqi conflict. The peaceful provincial elections across the nation Saturday reflected strides in political reconciliation and improvements in the performance of Iraqi security forces. But American commanders continually warn that the security gains are fragile and could be undermined by insurgents. The report says the U.S. government ""had neither the established structure nor the necessary resources to carry out the reconstruction mission it took on in mid-2003."" It weaves interviews, facts and vignettes detailing the use of a ""sea of taxpayer dollars"" from mid-2002 through autumn 2008. ""Hard Lessons"" also looks to the future. It stresses the importance of developing ""an agreed-upon doctrine and structure"" for reconstruction ""so that the United States is ready when it next must intervene in a failed or failing state."" The first of several principles mentioned for such operations: ""Security is necessary for large-scale reconstruction to succeed."" After U.S. forces toppled the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003, it was ""unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with what came next: a 'post-conflict' environment torn by violence, looters, criminals, a nascent insurgency; a governmental system in a state of complete collapse; and an economy that had slipped into idle and then switched off."" The raging Iraqi insurgency, crime and sectarian fighting ""informed and complicated every decision"" in funding such tasks as infrastructure building, security force development, job creation, economic reform and governance. ""The U.S. reconstruction management structure was overwhelmed by the challenges of building in a war zone,"" the report said. The program was marked by frequent changes in reconstruction strategy, ""turbulence"" caused by personnel turnover and ""poor integration"" of work by various U.S. government agencies. This was the result of ""weak unity of command and inconsistent unity of effort."" A lack of ""interagency debate"" took its toll when the U.S.-led Coalition Provincial Authority administered Iraq from May 2003 to June 2004. The report cites the agency's ""momentous orders"" of disbanding Iraq's military and removing members of Saddam's ruling Baath party from top government positions, a process called de-Baathification. ""Had these issues been fully discussed by the war Cabinet and within the CPA, the United States might have acted differently. Instead, the U.S. rebuilding program was left to deal with the instant loss of many of the Iraqi technocrats it would later need. ""It also had to build entirely new Iraqi security forces, a task that would ultimately consume more than half of all U.S.-appropriated reconstruction dollars,"" the report said. Through ""trial and error,"" the reconstruction program matured under successive U.S. ambassadors to Iraq John Negroponte, Zalmay Khalilzad and Ryan Crocker, and the U.S.-led ""surge"" and its ""complementary civilian effort"" led to a ""new era"" -- security strides and ""a more secure reconstruction environment."" And reconstruction became ""more Iraqi-driven and Iraqi-funded"" than it had been in 2003. Although there has been progress, ""the United States still struggled in late 2008 to make Iraq's reconstruction a success."" The program generally met its goals in developing the Iraqi security forces, but did not do so ""on the infrastructure front,"" the report concluded. Electricity and oil output are lower than the goals set five years ago by the CPA. ""Successful project completions in the key water and health sectors fell far short of hopes,"" the report said. There were ""egregious examples of fraud,"" but the amounts represented a small percentage of the overall reconstruction efforts, and the number of those ""involved was relatively low."" However, the waste ""grossly overburdened"" the program. ""The overuse of cost-plus contracts, high contractor overhead expenses, excessive contractor award fees, and unacceptable program and project delays all contributed to a significant waste of taxpayers' dollars,"" the report said. The report gives examples of waste, including the Khan Bani Saad prison project, which it describes as ""perhaps the single greatest project failure in the U.S. reconstruction program."" Bowen, who has been special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction since October 2004, previously served as the CPA's inspector general. He has had a longtime association with former President George W. Bush, serving in several capacities under his presidency, the Bush-Cheney transition team and Texas governorship.","New report cites failures in massive Iraq reconstruction initiative .

"(CNN) -- In November 1961, few would have realized just how groundbreaking the first issue of ""Fantastic Four"" would become. The series -- about a group of space explorers given various superpowers after being hit by cosmic rays -- began a new era for Marvel Comics, signaling the start of their wave of Silver Age characters, including Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Hulk, Iron Man and many more. Now, nearly 50 years later, the company has announced that the series' current story arc, ""Three"" -- the next-to-last issue of which hits stores Wednesday -- will result in the demise of one member of the iconic superhero team. Marvel executive editor Tom Brevoort made it crystal clear: ""A core character from the series, whom you've seen in the [2005 and 2007] films, will be no more,"" he told CNN. Current ""Fantastic Four"" writer Jonathan Hickman said that the plot twist grew from a multiyear story he pitched once he started working on the book. ""Everything has led to this moment,"" he said. ""It serves the story and gets where we want for the Fantastic Four."" ""This wasn't a case where we started with, 'Let's kill a character,' "" Brevoort said. ""[Hickman] had this story, and at one point, he said this character will die. There was never a moment where we said it could be this one or that one. There was only one choice to us as we headed down this series of stories."" Brevoort said this character's death will have a ripple effect on other Marvel books. ""The hook is the fact that one of the four characters will be shuffling off this mortal coil. That's really a small part,"" he said. ""What we're actually doing is completely transmogrifying the 'FF' as a thing. At the end of this story, there won't even be a book called 'Fantastic Four' anymore; there will be something new that will be interesting and exciting. Out of this moment, a new thing will be born."" Indeed, Marvel recently announced that the first issue of a new series called ""FF,"" subtitled ""A Beginning,"" will hit stores in March. This isn't the first time the team has experienced what at least seemed to be a death in Marvel's ""first family."" In 1994, for example, Sue Richards, a.k.a. the Invisible Woman, took over as team leader --- in what was, for a short time, a trio --- when her husband Reed, a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic, was believed to be dead. (It turned out he had been ripped out of the time stream.) Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the Thing, was briefly thought to be dead in 2004 as well. Then there was Superman's death in 1992 and Captain America's in 2007, which made big headlines at the time. And as with those characters, most seem to return eventually. ""Mainstream comics have done these 'Death of ...' stories so frequently, never keeping the characters dead, so it's lost all meaning to me as a fan,"" said Bob Bretall of comicbookpage.com, who nevertheless said he is really enjoying the current ""Fantastic Four"" story arc. ""Look no further than the upcoming 'death of Spider-Man.' Of course, it's not the 'real' Spider-Man, it's [the alternate universe] Ultimate Spider-Man."" Comic book reader/iReporter Omekongo Dibinga is also not a fan of characters dying and coming back: ""It's like a musician saying they're retiring and they keep coming back, like Jay-Z."" In response, Hickman said the ultimate gauge of its success would be its resonance with readers. ""I wanted to invert [the 'Mad Men' formula], to take a book about adventure and science fiction but inject nostalgia into it. Because that is the way the book feels now, this will resonate,"" he said. ""When you couple that with the fact that all of this was planned in advance and we're working toward a goal, I feel that we will be confident that we did a good job."" ""It's very easy to develop cynicism about the stories we tell,"" Brevoort added. ""The only way to combat and conquer it is to have a story that touches on the humanness of people that has emotional resonance and truth to it. The fact of death is something every human being can relate to. I would argue that a well-told story of a character's demise is not necessarily undone by them coming back later."" Brevoort went on to say that response from readers to the story has grown over the past few months, due in no small part to the way events have played out. ""We've tightened the screws and had each member in a critical life-or-death situation,"" he said. ""Once you get to [the most recent issue], you hopefully will have absolutely no idea which character will take the fall because there are dire circumstances and threats that make it unlikely that anybody will get out. It's amazing that all three get out alive."" Indeed, it's become a popular guessing game among readers as to which member will kick the bucket. Bretall believes it will be Johnny Storm, a.k.a. the Human Torch, since his death has not even been hinted at in previous stories. (Both the Torch and the Thing are holding down the fort at the team's Baxter Building, which the army of the Anti-priest plans to attack.) Dibinga is betting that the Thing will be the one to perish. ""He is the one who is the easiest to replace. There are not many characters with the powers of the other three,"" he said. ""Plus, he's not a direct part of the family, so he would be the easiest to let go."" Quite possibly the most recognizable character of the group, the loss of the Thing (known for the catchphrase ""It's clobberin' time!""), would be especially heartbreaking because he only recently has been able to go back to his normal appearance for one week out of every year. At the same time, he appeared in an image released Tuesday promoting this spring's big Marvel event, ""Fear Itself."" Invisible Woman seemed headed for danger, having told her family that she was leaving to ""referee a harmless meeting"" about New Atlantis, which has turned out to be anything but. Bretall points out another clue, though: ""On the cover of 'FF #1' they have three hexagons, two filled in & one clear, which I'm guessing represents Sue."" As for team leader Mr. Fantastic, he's currently dealing with the planet eater Galactus, who has reared his ugly head once again, and that's never good. So, who will it be? We'll find out with issue No. 587 on January 26; and if Marvel has its way, not a moment before. ""It will come sealed in a bag,"" Brevoort said. ""I cavalierly called it the 'death shroud.' "" The black bag with the ""Fantastic Four"" logo and a number three has been compared --- even by Brevoort --- to the bag that carried the ""Death of Superman"" issue. ""In this modern-day internet era, it's very difficult to keep any surprise a surprise,"" he said. ""Another predilection of our core constituency is they like to keep their books pristine. It will cause someone real pain to ruin the story and scan it.""","Marvel executive: ""A core character from the series ... will be no more""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Much has been made of Barack Obama's interest in ""Team of Rivals,"" Doris Kearns Goodwin's best-selling book on President Lincoln and his cabinet. Abraham Lincoln, seen here at Antietam, spent a great deal of time studying military history and strategy. But the president-elect may want to put a new Lincoln book on his nightstand, ""Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief"" (Penguin). The work by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James M. McPherson explores how the Illinois lawyer and self-taught military strategist managed to successfully prosecute the nation's bloodiest war. Like Lincoln, Obama enters office without any military experience of his own, yet he becomes commander in chief during a time of not one but two wars. What can Obama learn from Lincoln's example? CNN put that question to McPherson, but first we discussed how the 16th president developed into arguably the country's greatest commander in chief. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Abraham Lincoln came into office in 1861 with the United States on the brink of civil war. How did he get himself up to speed to make critical military decisions? James M. McPherson: We know from [Lincoln secretary] John Hay's diary that Lincoln spent a lot of time reading about military strategy, military theory, military history, to try to bring himself up to speed. I think another way in which he did it was to talk to as many people as he could find who knew something about the subject. Lincoln, of course, was an experienced trial lawyer. He knew how to cross-examine people to bring out information and I think that was another way in which he learned was just to talk to people and ask them questions and follow up those questions with further questions. CNN: Lincoln very quickly had to make momentous decisions, and often dealt with resistance or incompetence on the part of commanders in the field. McPherson: I think Lincoln was surprised by the degree to which he had to become involved in almost day-to-day strategic decisions and command decisions.. The [military commanders] to whom he delegated these responsibilities and these powers just did not exercise those powers, did not rise to the demand of the occasion, and so Lincoln had to do it himself. Lincoln had no substantial experience prior to the Civil War in military affairs, yet he found himself almost from day one having to make decisions that had large military implications, decisions that were sometimes based on purely military considerations, but in many cases were also based on political calculations that he had to make as president. CNN: In the introduction to your book you observe that Lincoln ""proved to be a more hands-on commander in chief than any other president."" McPherson: I think Lincoln took a more direct hand in formulating strategy and making command decisions than, say, Woodrow Wilson did in World War I and even FDR did in World War II. And that, in Lincoln's case, was not necessarily by choice but by default. CNN: Before Lincoln's presidency, the concept of commander in chief wasn't clearly defined. McPherson: Lincoln actually created the office of the modern commander in chief. The constitution merely says the president ""shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States and of the militia of the several states when called into federal service."" Period. It doesn't define the powers of the president as commander in chief and there weren't any useful precedents for Lincoln in 1861, so he had to establish the precedents. And what he did was to -- I wouldn't say usurp some of the powers that had been traditionally exercised by Congress in wartime in creating and maintaining an Army and Navy, but to assert powers that could really only be exercised by the commander in chief himself. ... He proclaimed the blockade of the Confederate coastline, which is really an act of war. ... He increased the size of the Army and Navy without congressional authorization. He suspended the writ of habeas corpus and the Chief Justice of the United States said that only Congress could do that. But Lincoln said this is logically an emergency function of the commander in chief and he established that precedent, as well. CNN: What do you think President-elect Obama might be able to learn from Lincoln as commander in chief? McPherson: Georges Clemenceau, the French prime minister during World War I, famously said that ""War is too important to be left to the generals."" Lincoln certainly would have agreed with that. What Clemenceau meant is that every activity involved with fighting a war has political consequences, has consequences far beyond the battlefield, has an impact on the entire society and therefore can't really be decided strictly on military criteria. And I think that Lincoln certainly learned that and that's something Obama will have to keep in mind. I think he probably is well aware of it, that, for example, whatever decisions he makes about withdrawing troops from Iraq or beefing up troops in Afghanistan don't take place in a social and cultural and political vacuum. They all have consequences far beyond the battlefield itself. CNN: Lincoln used his incredible gifts with language to great advantage during the Civil War. Can Obama learn from that? McPherson: Lincoln had the ability to communicate ideas and communicate policy to the average person. He could make things clear, even complicated things clear, to the average person, and I think Obama has that gift, too. CNN: Do you see temperamental similarities between Obama and Lincoln? Some people have noted that. McPherson: I think I do. ... Lincoln occasionally did lose his temper, but he usually managed to maintain his cool. ... This kind of temperament -- keeping your cool, keeping your temper, trying to base your decisions on rational thought rather than emotions or temporary explosions of temper -- I think they're similar in that respect and that was a really important factor in Lincoln's leadership qualities. CNN: Finally, as a historian, does it give you pleasure that Obama is apparently a reader of history? McPherson: Well yes, it's almost exhilarating to have a president who reads history, knows history and realizes the value of understanding history. ""Pleasure"" is the right word.","James M. McPherson's new book: ""Tried by War""
Historian shows how Abraham Lincoln handled war, made much up along the way .

"(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos ""perhaps the greatest living American crime writer."" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the ""undisputed poet"" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, ""The Cut."" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite ""Western"" feel to ""The Cut."" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, ""Treme."" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series ""The Wire"" and the miniseries ""The Pacific."" Read an excerpt from ""The Cut"" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: Tell me more about your new character, Spero Lucas. Is he meant to be representative of the current generation of young American veterans? Pelecanos: I had met many wounded veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center when I was researching my 2009 novel ""The Turnaround,"" and I continue to be very interested in how returning servicemen and women deal with their new lives back home, and how they're treated by America. At the same time, I noticed that there were an unusual amount of Marines with combat experience who had taken jobs as investigators for attorneys here in D.C. Then one day, I had a chance encounter and enlightening conversation with a vet who had lost a leg in Iraq. All of these things were knocking on the door of my imagination, telling me to write a novel. CNN: Spero, like a lot of your characters, is not a conventional ""good guy."" He does some bad things to some bad people in ""The Cut,"" and you allude to some dark events from his past. Pelecanos: My father was a Marine who fought in the Pacific in WW II. He was a very tough guy, but after the war, he lived his life in a quiet and reserved manner, because he had nothing to prove. I know now that he internalized his war experience. I imagined Spero Lucas to be the same way. In the next Lucas book, more will be revealed. CNN: ""The Cut"" reveals, as do all of your books, a side of Washington, D.C., we don't often see portrayed. What is it you see in D.C. that others miss? Pelecanos: I've just been very interested in the living side of Washington, rather than the federal side, since I was a kid. I basically go out there and get engaged. Some of my books are heavily researched in terms of archival work, but this one was all street-level, shoe-leather stuff. I am on my bike daily, and most of the locations, warehouses and specific residences from ""The Cut"" were found while I was riding. On those rides, I took photos and videos from my iPhone. D.C.'s an alley town, so it's particularly conducive to bike reconnaissance. Lucas likes to walk at night; in one scene, this leads to a violent confrontation in an elevated church parking lot on Georgia Avenue, just behind Fort Stevens Park. I walked that route myself one summer night. The kayak scenes were written after I paddled the waters of the upper Potomac. When walking or biking wasn't practical, I drove my Jeep. If I wanted to go fast, I took my Mustang. CNN: You describe the streets, neighborhoods and shops of Washington in near map-like detail. I'm pretty sure if I got lost, I could pull out one of your books to find my way back. Pelecanos: I hope so. I'm leaving a record. CNN: Your books always include great descriptions of food and music. I can almost taste the meals the characters eat, hear the music on the jukebox. Is this as fun to research and write as it is to read? Pelecanos: Absolutely. I usually buy a bunch of music that fits the book and its characters before I start writing, and give myself an education. I can tell you that the restaurant scenes were heavily ""researched."" When David Simon and Eric Overmyer asked me to participate in their show, ""Treme,"" I didn't have to think too hard on it. New Orleans, food, music ... I was there. Just because it's work, doesn't mean you can't have fun. CNN: You're an award-winning writer and producer for ""The Wire"" and now ""Treme."" How is working for TV different from writing novels? Pelecanos: Collaboration versus solitude, of course. I actually like working with a bunch of creative people who come together to build something. After 10 years, the process still fascinates me. When you write for television, you have to come to terms with the fact that what you pen is not yours. Show runners, directors, actors, editors and costume designers are your co-writers, in a sense, and often they elevate what you do. By my first love is writing novels. The books are all mine. CNN: You write about some of your favorite books, movies and music on your website. Anything you're reading, watching or listening to right now you'd like to recommend? Pelecanos: Last week, I watched three extraordinary genre movies from, respectively, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong: ""13 Assassins,"" also ""The Man from Nowhere"" and ""Ip Man."" The last 45 minutes of ""13 Assassins,"" directed by Takashi Miike, is one of the most stunning extended action sequences ever filmed. Recently, I re-read my John Steinbeck library and was reminded that ""The Red Pony"" is one deep, dark book. Thurston Moore's new one, ""Demolished Thoughts"" is a beautiful, dreamlike record. D.C. has seen a reggae and funk resurgence of late. In that vein, I recommend See-I's debut and the compilation ""The New Gold Standard 2"" by Fort Knox Five. CNN: What's next? Can readers look forward to Spero's return? Pelecanos: I'll get started on a new Spero Lucas book soon. In the meantime, I recently finished a novel set in 1972. More on that to come.

"Anchorage, Alaska (CNN) -- It's 3 degrees and snowing outside the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage, but inside the operations center, things are heating up. Geologist Michelle Coombs monitors the Redoubt volcano from the Alaska Volcano Observatory. ""This is kind of the nerve center, if you will,"" says geologist Michelle Coombs, who is at the helm of a bank of video monitors showing readouts from sensors on Mount Redoubt, a volcano about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage. The sensors measure seismic activity on the volcano's summit. Scientists at the observatory combine that information with data gathered from daily airplane flights to the volcano to measure gases and try to figure out if and when Redoubt is going to blow. ""We're seeing lots of little earthquakes right now,"" says Coombs. ""As that magma rises, it breaks rock as it gets to the surface, and it also it gives off gases, and that leads to the seismic activities were seeing now."" When the magma, or molten rock, makes it to the surface, the volcano will erupt. A siren goes off, and one of the video monitors goes haywire. Is the mountain erupting?  Learn more about Mount Redoubt » . ""That's just a little alarm. There was just a little bit of increased seismic activity,"" Coombs says reassuringly. ""It's a special kind of earthquake particular to volcanoes called a long-period earthquake. It has more to do with fluid and gases than with breaking rock.""  Watch Coombs keeping an eye on Redoubt » . Since the monitors first showed increased activity on January 23, the observatory has been staffed 24 hours a day. Scientists here are calling in reinforcements; several geologists from the Lower 48 have been making their way north to help. Coombs thinks Redoubt will erupt within days or weeks. No one lives near the mountain, which sits on the Cook Inlet and is largely surrounded by glacier ice. That means there is no direct danger from lava flows, but huge clouds of ash could spread throughout Alaska. When Redoubt last erupted in 1989, it spread ash across Alaska for five months. ""Geologists like to use the past as a key to the future, and previous historical eruptions of Redoubt have produced ash clouds of up to 40,000 feet above sea level,"" says Coombs. She notes that at current weather conditions, ""it would take about three hours for that ash to leave the volcano and arrive in Anchorage."" The ash is composed largely of silica, which is similar to tiny fragments of glass. Down on the ground, the ash can be dangerous to breath in and can damage cars as their engines draw the ash into their engines. But it is usually a nuisance. However, in the sky, the ash clouds can create very dangerous flying conditions for jets. ""For jet aviation, it's a very severe hazard because jet engines run at a very high temperature. And once that silica-rich ash gets ingested into the engine, it can remelt and coat the insides of the engines and freeze up those engines,"" says Coombs. ""That's really the major thing we are trying to avoid here."" The day after the 1989 eruption of Redoubt, a 747 flew into an ash cloud near Anchorage and all four engines stalled. The pilot was able to get two of the engines restarted, and the plane landed safely. Coombs says airspace around the volcano and Anchorage may be closed if Redoubt erupts. When the alarms aren't blaring, Coombs sends out the official Twitter feeds from the observatory and tries to stay warm. She is eight months' pregnant. ""People have been joking, 'Are you going to name him redoubt?' "" she says with a laugh, then shakes her head and gets back to her monitors.","In the cold Alaskan winter, geologist keeps watch on Mount Redoubt .

"London (CNN) -- Seven men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, West Midlands police said Friday. The arrests on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday followed the discovery of two guns and a small amount of ammunition hidden in a car stopped by police last weekend who believed it was uninsured, the police said. The news comes as Britain is in a state of heightened security ahead of the London Olympics, which open in three weeks. On Thursday, armed police in Staffordshire closed a major highway and called in bomb disposal squads when a passenger on a bus raised the alarm over smoke coming from a fellow traveler's bag. The source turned out to be a quit-smoking aid, and no arrests were made. Police in London also arrested six people Thursday on suspicion of committing, planning or instigating terror offenses. Those arrests were not related to the Olympic or Paralympic Games, police said. The arrests announced Friday involve six men from the West Midlands, all in their 20s, and a 43-year-old man from West Yorkshire. Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain? The seven men have been detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, a police statement said. Detective Chief Supt. Kenny Bell of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said: ""As soon as the items were discovered in the impounded vehicle, our priority was to protect the public by pursuing and arresting those we believed to be involved."" The firearms, which were not loaded when they were found, are being tested, and police are searching a number of addresses, the statement said. No information has yet been given on the motivation of the suspects. However, it is understood that the individuals arrested in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire were not targeting the Olympics, nor did they have any links to those arrested Thursday in London. Following these arrests the UK Home Office website has not changed the terror threat level from ""substantial,"" which is the third highest of five levels. The next level up is ""severe,"" which means an attack is ""highly likely,"" and the highest is ""critical,"" meaning an attack is ""expected imminently."" Additional security measures will be in place in London and elsewhere during the Olympics. They include the siting of missile defense systems around the capital and fighter jets on standby at air bases close to London. Police and intelligence agencies have also stepped up monitoring efforts. Government officials from Washington to London insist there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the Olympics. Nonetheless, authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are urging vigilance. The Metropolitan Police is leading the ""largest peacetime operation"" seen in the United Kingdom as it seeks to keep the public safe, it said, with up to 9,500 police officers from London and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the Olympics. As a result, London's residents and its visitors can expect to see a large police presence on the streets and airport-style security at Olympic venues. The driver of the bus caught up in Thursday's terror alert on the M6 Toll motorway was praised by his company, Megabus, in a statement Friday for his ""calm and professional"" response to the incident. ""It was a scary thing for a lot of people and it was a very long and tiring day,"" the driver is quoted as saying. ""We were all in it together and when you're faced with armed police you can't really do anything else other than follow their instructions."" Bus scare, terror arrests ramp up UK security concerns ahead of Olympics . CNN's Laura Perez Maestro and Jonathan Wald contributed to this report.","NEW: Police found two unloaded guns and some ammunition in a car they stopped .

"Rome (CNN) -- James Gandolfini probably died of a heart attack, according to the head of a Rome hospital's emergency department where the actor was taken after falling ill at a hotel in the Italian capital. The body of the actor was transferred to the morgue at the Policlinico Umberto I hospital in Rome early Thursday, where it awaited an autopsy. By law, medical examiners in Italy are required to carry out the postmortem 24 hours after the body's arrival in the morgue, a hospital spokesman said. Professor Claudio Modini, head of the emergency department where the actor was taken, said he could not be certain of the cause of death until after the autopsy -- but it was ""probably a natural cause of death, myocardial infarction,"" or heart attack. Appreciation: James Gandolfini, a pure actor . Emergency room doctors had not noted any suspicious factors, such as alcohol, on his medical report, he said. Ambulance staff tried to resuscitate the actor at the hotel, and further efforts were made when he reached the emergency room, Modini said, but Gandolfini was dead when he arrived at the hospital, and ""there was nothing to do."" Though the cause of death is not confirmed, his managers also believe that a heart attack killed the man who portrayed Tony Soprano, a washed-up mob boss prone to keeling over from panic attacks, at age 51. Before Italian authorities can release Gandolfini's remains for transport back to the United States, the U.S. Embassy in Rome must issue a death certificate. No one from the embassy or the actor's family has contacted the morgue yet, morgue spokesman Antonio Spasola said Thursday morning. The U.S. Embassy said it was ""deeply upset"" by the news of Gandolfini's premature death but had not yet received any official confirmation from local authorities. The embassy ""will offer any proper assistance to the family when they request it,"" its statement said. Enjoying Italy . Hours before he died, Gandolfini told Mario Sesti by phone how much he was looking forward to the next leg of his Italian vacation. He was heading for Taormina in Sicily, a quaint town packed with historical architecture and nestled between lush green hills and the azure waters of the Mediterranean Sea. There, he was to receive an award at a local film festival held before the backdrop of an ancient Roman arena. Sesti, who heads the festival, was eagerly awaiting Gandolfini's arrival Friday. He was shaken by the news of his death. Sesti will replace the award ceremony with a tribute to Gandolfini's lifetime achievement. ""He was the American actor who better than anyone else was able to interpret the Italian-American society, with all of its rich contrasts, ambitions, pain, humor,"" Sesti said. Opinion: Gandolfini's gift to television -- and America . A medical emergency . Michael Kobold, who described himself as a close family friend of Gandolfini, gave more details of his final moments in a news conference Thursday at the Boscolo Exedra Rome Hotel, where the actor was staying. Gandolfini experienced a medical emergency about 10 p.m. Wednesday, he said. His family found him in his room. ""The hotel notified emergency crews who responded, and first aid was administered before Mr. Gandolfini was taken to the hospital, where he died of an apparent heart attack,"" he said. ""Our prayers and condolences go out to Mr. Gandolfini's family and friends."" Kobold said he'd known the actor from New Jersey for more than a decade and lived with him years ago. ""I consider him like a big brother,"" he said, as he appealed for privacy for Gandolfini's grieving family. The suddenness of Gandolfini's death struck many people at home and around the world. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was among them, saying the news was ""an awful shock."" Heart attacks can happen at any age. But usually, first heart attacks don't strike until the victim is older than 60. ""This is young to have a heart attack, even when you look at any pre-existing health conditions,"" CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said. However, risk factors such as obesity, smoking, lack of exercise and stress can cause them to occur earlier in life, Gupta said. ""He loved his food. He didn't push back from the table,"" said journalist Larry King, who spent time with the actor on and off camera. Photos and anecdotes indicate that Gandolfini enjoyed cigars. Though intense outbursts of adrenaline-infused anger were a mainstay of Tony Soprano's character, he was a far cry from Gandolfini. Jovial, fun, reserved . Colleagues described him as funny, kind and gentle. He had a reputation for often being reserved and quiet. He didn't seek publicity, avoiding media coverage, journalists have said. Edie Falco, the actress who played Tony's wife, Carmela, said Gandolfini was a ""man of tremendous depth and sensitivity, with a kindness and generosity beyond words."" ""I consider myself very lucky to have spent 10 years as his close colleague. My heart goes out to his family,"" Falco said in a statement Thursday. ""The love between Tony and Carmela was one of the greatest I've ever known."" Former CIA chief Leon Panetta, played by Gandolfini in the movie ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" also issued a statement about the actor Thursday. ""James Gandolfini was a friend and a great actor. He wrote me after portraying me last year, which was a great thrill and honor. I told him I was glad an Italian played me -- swear words and all. We laughed together at the fact that tough guys can have a heart of gold. He did, and we will miss him."" Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also mourned the ""Sopranos"" actor. ""Yesterday, we lost a talented actor and advocate for our service members. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Gandolfini family,"" a statement from the general said Thursday. Tributes poured in on social media, describing Gandolfini as jovial and likable. Actor Mark Ruffalo shared his grief on Twitter: ""Oh Jimmy. It's a crying shame. You stormed in and out. Your voice like velvet granite. From a whisper to a shout. A comet of a man."" He lit up the room with a big smile . Even after his ""Sopranos"" fame, he was very down to earth, said iReporter Pat Tantalo, who worked on the set of a 2006 movie Gandolfini starred in. From the mouth of Tony Soprano: Best quotes . He lit up the room with a big smile the first time he walked into the production office, Tantalo recalled. ""We instantly connected. He planted his huge mitts on my shoulders and called me a little bull."" Tantalo posted a goodbye tribute on CNN's iReport website with a photo of Gandolfini's arm around his shoulder. Both men are smiling ear to ear. They exchanged telephone numbers and spent some of their evenings sitting around together on a deck by a lake smoking cigars and telling stories. ""It was like we had been friends forever,"" Tantalo said. IReporter Shana O'Neil met Gandolfini when he was shooting in her office in 1994. She remembers him as ""Jersey through and through,"" a trait he did share with mobster Tony Soprano. But he was so much friendlier, O'Neil said. ""I just always think of him as that guy."" His ""Sopranos"" fame, she said, changed nothing about the way she remembers him. Galdolfini left his mark on New Jersey . CNN's Livia Borghese reported from Rome and Ben Brumfield wrote in Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- He held power over his country for more than 30 years, and his ouster last year was seen as a sign that the Arab Spring could bring unlikely revolutions to the Middle East. But if Hosni Mubarak were to die soon -- as some close to him suggest could happen -- it would probably have little impact on the country's future, experts said Wednesday. Speaking the day after a state news agency called Mubarak ""clinically dead,"" and the nation's military rulers said he was instead in critical condition, analysts in Cairo said his death would probably not trigger widespread outpourings of grief, nor ripple effects on how the new government is shaped. There could, however, be a new round of angry protests if he received a military funeral, they said. Conflicting reports about whether Mubarak has died . Mubarak ""has been politically dead for a year and a half,"" said Josh Stacher, an Egypt expert with Kent State University, who has spent the past month in Cairo. ""I would suspect that if he would die, not a lot of people would care."" Khaled Fahmy, chair of the history department at the American University in Cairo, said reports about Mubarak's health add to ""anxiety and confusion"" in the country, but ""this is not the main thing that is happening in Egypt now."" Across the country, people are concerned about the future of the government, after the highest court dissolved parliament, military rulers claimed full legislative authority, and both candidates in the presidential runoff election claimed victory. Furthermore, reports of Mubarak's potential demise are nothing new. Mubarak off life support . ""People have grown so accustomed to people saying Mubarak is having near-death experiences that no one really takes them seriously,"" Stacher said. At the hospital where he was being treated Tuesday night, there was no additional security, no crowd outside. Meanwhile, protesters at Tahrir Square questioned the accuracy of the reports and said they were focused entirely on getting a new government in place. ""I've come from far away. I'm not leaving until (Mohamed) Morsi swears the oath in front of the legitimately elected parliament,"" said Sayed Ahmed, who supports the Muslim Brotherhood candidate for president. ""We're having a sit-in. I don't care about Mubarak. These are games played by the intelligence services."" ""It's a media stunt, to divert attention from the constitutional decree,"" said demonstrator Taha Shaker, referring to a move by the military council stripping the presidency of some powers. ""We've started a sit-in and won't leave unless the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces leaves unconditionally."" The life of Hosni Mubarak . Throughout Cairo on Wednesday, ""the only thing"" people were talking about was the presidential battle, Stacher said. If Mubarak were to die, it would not make a blip in the course of Egyptian history, he said. ""I think there will be a lot of mythology about Hosni Mubarak in the years to come. But I would not expect massive turnout to take over Cairo or parts of the country. ... In fact, if there is any public participation, it's going to be a celebration of his death."" A ""major part of the population"" actually supports the status quo -- the military leadership -- and does not want the Muslim Brotherhood, which opposed Mubarak's regime, to take over, Stacher said. But few among them support Mubarak himself. ""Mubarak has largely been portrayed and understood as the reason for so much instability."" So both sides view him as ""toxic,"" Stacher said. But while Mubarak's death wouldn't change the course of Egypt's future, the way the country handles it could stir emotional reactions, Fahmy said. How Egypt's generals cut the revolution down to size . ""I think a military funeral would enrage the people in Tahrir,"" he said. ""It would mean the military still respecting him and willing to turn a blind eye to the fact that he's now a convicted criminal."" This month, Mubarak was found guilty of ordering the killing of protesters and was sentenced to life in prison. Salma Othman, who was protesting Tuesday in Tahrir Square, told CNN she found it ""extremely provocative"" for the SCAF to suggest it was considering granting a military funeral. ""This is outrageous! He is a prisoner,"" the 32-year-old real estate agent said. Still, Mubarak does maintain some support among Egyptians, says Shibley Telhami, Anwar Sadat professor at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. And as long as he is alive, whoever has control in Egypt will have some key decisions to make about his fate. ""It is obvious that the military leaders consider him one of them and they would like to do their utmost to protect him without causing violent anger. If he stays alive, they would have to contend with a possible Islamist president who is unlikely to show leniency."" Even some who oppose him want to see him treated leniently, while others ""want to see him humiliated and punished,"" Telhami said. ""Egypt is divided along many lines, as the presidential elections have demonstrated, and Mubarak is a central symbol of these divisions."" His ""health and stories about his health are bound to highlight the enormous divisions and the deep emotions during a critical time of transition and uncertainty."" One young protester summed up how little impact the reports of Mubarak's health -- and the possibility of his death -- have on many Egyptians. ""Mubarak's not any different than anyone else,"" said Massa el Gamal, 18. ""I feel bad if a dog dies. I feel bad, but I also feel bad about those who died in the revolution. I think of parents who lost a child."" Both presidential candidates claim victory in Egypt . CNN's Ivan Watson and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","Hosni Mubarak ""has been politically dead for a year and a half,"" an Egypt expert says .
A military funeral would ""enrage"" many, a university history department chairman says .
""I don't care about Mubarak,"" says protester who supports Muslim Brotherhood candidate .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps you've been to the Everglades, toured Yosemite or visited Point Reyes National Seashore and discovered the glorious nature and historical events celebrated and protected by our national parks. Ever been to the longest cave in the world? Or the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier islands in the world? Known to many national park aficionados who collect park passport stamps, the lesser-known national parks throughout the country are also worthy of your visit. Parks will have special programming during National Park Week, April 21-29. And parks that charge admission will waive their fees that week, adding to their allure. ""The options are endless -- view spectacular scenery, see where history happened, take a hike, go on a picnic or look for wildlife,"" said Jonathan B. Jarvis, director of the National Park Service. ""Be sure to 'picture yourself in a national park' this week and share your photos, videos, and stories at www.nationalparkweek.org."" Think a national park is too far away? Every U.S. state except Delaware has at least one national park, as do Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. In celebration of National Park Week and Earth Day on April 22, here are our suggestions for heading back to nature. Canyon De Chelly (Arizona): For nearly 5,000 years, people have lived uninterrupted in Canyon De Chelly National Park, longer than anyplace else on the Colorado Plateau. About 40 Navajo families live within the park boundaries, farming the land and raising livestock. The Park Service and the Navajo Nation jointly manage the park, and during National Park Week, there will be free ranger-led hikes and programs. Other tours are self-guided and free, but some require a Navajo guide and a fee. The visitor center includes a silversmith demonstration area. Camping is available. Mammoth Cave National Park (Kentucky): Take a tour of the longest cave in the world at Mammoth Cave National Park in south-central Kentucky, where 390 miles of cave passages have already been explored. A couple of the cave tours will be free during National Park Week. (Tour tickets are still required, so make sure to call for a reservation or get tickets at the visitor center.) There will also be special walks and activities for Wildflower Day on April 21 and Junior Ranger Day on April 28. There is also boating, canoeing, fishing, camping and horseback riding in the park. Biscayne National Park (Florida): Minutes from the hustle and bustle of Miami, Biscayne National Park is an incredible combination of 10,000 years of human history and four different ecosystems that have come together in this protected area. First-time visitors to the park can enjoy a free daily ranger-led tour or a free two- to three-hour canoe tour every Monday, Wednesday and Friday through April. Boat tours are also available through independent companies (fees vary). Experienced adult outdoor enthusiasts can book an all-day kayak trip every Saturday through April (cost is $89). Most of the park is covered by water, but don't simply motor up in your own boat or forget to plan ahead. The time of year determines, in part, what's available to do at the park. Padre Island National Seashore (Texas): It's the longest section of undeveloped barrier island in the world. Spain, Mexico and the Republic of Texas all laid claim to Padre Island, which was finally taken over by the United States after the Mexican-American War (1845-1848). The island was named after Spanish priest Padre Nicolas Brill, who established the first permanent settlement there around 1804. Sea turtle nesting season started April 1, and sea turtle hatchling releases may start in late May. (Call the Hatchling Hotline at 361-949-7163 for more information.) There are also free ranger talks, birding tours and even a Saturday night stargazing party. The park also has no-reservations camping, fishing, bring-your-own bike biking and swimming. Think kid friendly: While most national parks have ""kid friendly"" recommendations, the parks will turn their attention to even more children's events with National Kids to Parks Day on Saturday, May 19. There will be events at many of the nation's parks and even outside the parks. (Delaware, which has no national parks, still has two nature-filled events that day.) ""Kids love nature, and nature needs kids because without kids who love nature, we'll have no grownups left to protect it,"" said Jennifer Emmett, editorial director of National Geographic Kids Books. ""I have three kids, and they love to be outside. Experiencing nature is really inspiring for them, and it's really important to get them outside of their daily life and into the woods or beach."" Emmett has a few recommendations from the latest edition of ""National Geographic Kids National Parks Guide USA."" She likes the ranger-led nighttime ""owl prowls"" at Congaree National Park in South Carolina. ""Also keep your eyes peeled for bobcats, river otter and wild pigs."" At Isle Royale National Park in Michigan, she recommends exploring by canoe or backpacking into the backcountry, where you can sometimes spot moose and foxes. ""In July and August, you can pick blueberries and thimbleberries in the park's lush green meadows,"" she said. Virgin Islands National Park boasts an underwater nature trail in Trunk Bay. ""Take a snorkel hike! Park animal sightings include sea turtles, pelicans and mongooses."" Pick the park closest to you: Head to the National Park Service website and plug in your state to find the park nearest to your home. If nature isn't your thing, chances are you'll find many national park historic sites in urban and suburban areas. And if you need a guidebook to help you choose which of the 58 scenic national parks is right for you, try the latest edition of the ""National Geographic Guide to National Parks of the United States,"" or visit the National Geographic national parks website. Dress right: Check a park's website or your guidebook to see if you'll need suntan lotion, warmer clothes for cave exploration, hiking shoes for hikes at higher elevations, bug spray for heading into swamps or other necessities, says National Geographic's Emmett. And know your child's stamina for longer walks or thinner air at higher elevations. Get the free app: The National Park Service now has a free app that will help you plan your park trips and track which of the 397 national parks you've already visited (even adding your photos and thoughts). The app also helps National Park Passport holders find passport stamp cancellation stations within the national parks to record which parks they visited and when. (Most national parks participate in the program.) The app is available for iPhones and iPads, and an Android app is in development. What's your favorite national park or other spot to enjoy nature?

"(CNN) -- The PGA Tour has been littered with surprise winners in 2014. Last week Matt Every became the latest unexpected champion, claiming his first title at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Could Australia's Steven Bowditch be added to the list? Bowditch, the 339th-ranked golfer in the world, held the clubhouse lead deep into the second round of the Valero Texas Open. The Australian has only finished in the top three once at a PGA Tour event -- he tied for second last year at the Greenbrier Classic -- and missed the cut at half of his PGA tournaments in the 2013 season. But the story isn't as simple as that: Bowditch has spoken publicly about his battle with depression and once tried to commit suicide. After finishing his first round earlier Friday -- fog had delayed play Thursday -- Bowditch strung together a 5-under-par 67 in San Antonio to sit atop the leaderboard thanks to a two-round total of 8-under-par 136. That despite a double bogey on his final hole. ""It was a frustrating way to finish,"" Bowditch, who struck an eagle 2 at the 12th, told the PGA Tour's website. ""I hit a couple of bad shots. It is what it is. ""I got off to a good start this morning, finishing off my first round, and then sort of kept it rolling there for a little bit. It was good. I'm happy with it."" The 30-year-old led Chad Collins -- ranked outside the top 300 -- and 505th-ranked PGA Tour rookie Andrew Loupe by a shot. Four-time major winner Ernie Els, however, was expected to miss the cut after posting 74s in both of his rounds. His second round included three bogeys and one birdie.

"STERLING, Alaska (CNN) -- From the Seavey dog sled kennel you get a clear view of the Redoubt volcano, and the Seavey family is watching closely. Mitch Seavey, 2004 Iditarod champion musher, with a team of sled dogs in Sterling, Alaska. The volcano is expected to erupt any day now, and the Seaveys are trying to find a way of keeping their prized sled dogs safe from the ash that may fall over a large portion of Alaska. The ash is highly abrasive and dangerous to breathe in for both humans and dogs. ""How we react to the volcano is going to depend on the scope of it, I guess. We have my grandfather's kennel we can move to about 200 miles from here,"" said Danny Seavey, adding with a laugh: ""If it's so big that it covers most of the state then I don't now what we're going to do. Move to Russia or something, I guess."" But moving the dogs 200 miles away is no easy task. The Seavey kennel has about 100 sled dogs that are training for the Iditarod sled dog race that begins in early March. The race spans 1,150 miles, from Anchorage to Nome. To make the run, the dogs must be in tip-top shape. The Seaveys can't afford a break from training the dogs, and they can't allow the dogs, who sleep outside in small crates, to be exposed to the dangerous falling ash. ""They are very well fed, highly trained athletes,"" said Seavey. ""We're only a month from the Iditarod. They need to be training right now."" iReport.com: Seen the Iditarod? Prepping for the volcano? Seavey expects to have very little time to get the dogs to safety. ""Oh, yeah, it would be in a hurry. At the current wind conditions we would have about two hours from when it blows to when the ash gets here,"" he said. ""We have big trucks, and each dog has a little kennel that they can hop in ... so we have three of these trucks, and we can move 60 or 70 dogs that way.""  Watch the sled dogs in action » . Seavey says the canine exodus is ""going to look crazy, a bunch of dog trucks and horse trailers running east. That's our only plan right now."" Plans are easier to come by for the human population of the Kenai Peninsula. Scott Walden is the emergency management coordinator for the Borough of Kenai. ""It can create a sense of panic,"" Walden said. ""It's sudden. It's hard to predict when and where it's going to hit.""  Learn more about Mount Redoubt » . He was fire chief when Redoubt last erupted in 1989 and says the biggest hazard is the slippery driving conditions the ash will present. The borough plans to close schools as soon as Redoubt blows, hoping to get all the kids home safe in the two hours they will have between the eruption and the ash hitting the ground. Walden is instructing people to take shelter and hopes to keep most people off the road for about a day while the ash falls. He says everyone should have paper respirator masks, plastic sheets to seal up their houses and a weather radio to monitor the situation. Down the road at the Home Depot, manager Mark Pierson says business in Redoubt-preparation supplies has been brisk . ""The biggest thing that we're selling is the dust masks,"" says Pierson, who had to order extra stock. ""We've bent over backwards to make sure we have these for the customers."" Pierson grew up on the Kenai Peninsula and was here when Redoubt erupted in 1989 and when the nearby Augustine volcano erupted in 1986. He saved ash from the Augustine eruption in a jar. He says people here are used to dealing with nature and the hardships that come from living in a place that can be beautiful one minute and dangerous the next. ""I think people here want to be prepared, but I don't see too many people over-reacting,"" he said. ""You learn not to panic, you learn to be prepared.""","Dog sled kennel is near volcanic Mount Redoubt in Alaska .

"(CNN) -- Imagine lying in the back of a gondola, watching life pass by in one of the world's most picturesque cities. The grand architecture allied to the ornate palaces and grand statues which adorn Venice's enchanted waterways leave tourists awestruck. Then there is St Mark's Square -- the money shot which every tourist wants to capture as they sail towards the iconic Basilica of San Marco. So imagine the frustration when that photo -- that one moment you've been waiting for -- includes the huge funnel of a cruise ship the size of a floating city. But now these floating metropolises, complete with their several restaurants, theaters, cinemas and range of swimming pools, will have to find a new place to park up with the local government moving to strike a balance between tourism and protecting the city's image. The city has imposed new restrictions on cruise liners entering the city -- with those weighing over 96,000 tonnes banned from sailing down the world famous Giudecca canal from November 2014. And from January traffic will be cut by 20% -- from 2012 levels -- on ships weighing more than 40,000 tonnes which enter the Giudecca canal linking the main part of Venice to the island of Giudecca. ""I don't think anybody knows the impact it will have at moment,"" Carolyn Spencer Brown editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic -- a website devoted to the cruise industry -- told CNN. ""From the perspective of our readers, there has been a lot of confusion but the bottom line is that the cruise ships are still stopping in Venice. ""Venice is the bucket list city of all time and everyone should have the opportunity to see it. ""The only big change is where the boats sail in and out -- it's a beautiful experience. ""I don't think it will stop people going or spoil the experience. It's still a great place to embark or disembark from because you can always book a hotel and get a bus into town."" The restrictions mean that some tourists will now be unable to take in the breathtaking view of St Mark's Square while on board the ship. One of the world's most popular tourist destinations, Venice draws hundreds and thousands of sightseers each and every year intent on exploring its intricate series of canals and waterways. But anger has been growing among Venetians over the number of cruise ships sailing to the port and infringing on the city's picturesque landscape. In September protestors jumped into the water and managed to delay several ships from sailing up the Giudecca canal while others clashed with riot police on the banks. The new regulations will mean that only five cruise liners will be able to sit in the port at any one time, while they will be unable to move between sunrise and sunset. ""Finally the trend towards gigantic ships in the lagoon has been turned around,"" the mayor of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni, said in a statement to the media. ""We've had enough of these mega cruise ships just meters away from San Marco, from now on there will be clear limits on the size of ships that can enter Venice."" While liners can currently move to within 300 meters of St Mark's Square and experience the view in all its glory, the cruise industry has been supportive of the new regulations. In a statement given to CNN by CLIA, the Cruise Lines International Association Europe, the organization stated its commitment to finding a ""sustainable and long-term solution"" for the city of Venice. It read: ""CLIA views the outcome of the meeting that took place last week in Rome as a positive on-going commitment of the representatives of the Italian Institutions to find a sustainable and long term solution for the city of Venice. ""This goal is shared by the cruise industry. We are in the process of determining the impact of the decision, and any estimation or evaluation at this time is premature. ""Venice is consistently rated as the number one European cruise destination for our industry and we look forward to further strengthening our role as a key contributor to the economic vitality of Venice.""","Venice will limit the number of cruise ships allowed to sail into Italian city's port .

"(CNN) -- There are up to 7 billion geniuses in this world -- are you one of them? How can we nurture the world's many talented people so they most effectively contribute to the world's economic health? Start by figuring out what they need to flourish and how to overcome the barriers that stand in their way. I'm not talking about Silicon Valley software geniuses or corporate business tycoons. I'm talking about the geniuses who are all around us -- maybe even the one staring at you in the mirror: Individuals who have solid ideas for developing or marketing products or services that benefit consumers. They could be immigrants who travel the globe searching for better opportunities for themselves and their families, entrepreneurs-to-be who could be breathing life into communities ripe for revitalization, or social entrepreneurs who find innovative solutions to social challenges and change the world for the better. ""There's a lot of promise out there,"" Senegal-born entrepreneur Magatte Wade said at a United Nations conference last month. ""There are millions of issues that can be addressed by billions of geniuses -- and they can be addressing millions of opportunities to co-create solutions."" Wade is a successful businesswoman who moved from France to the United States to live out her dreams in a more conducive environment that celebrates—rather than discourages—risk, innovation and enterprise. Opinion: Solving 'the Google problem' key to ensuring the Internet's success . She spoke from heart and experience as she told the audience about the obstacles she faced while developing her former beverage company based on indigenous hibiscus flower ingredients, and her skin care company based on ancient Senegalese recipes. The condescending attitude of developed and developing countries toward African businesses and the lack of respect for African culture and vision —both within her own country and worldwide—continue to be impediments to her and Africans like her who dare to dream big. Her experiences turned into practical recommendations as she advised the assembly on how to make life better for entrepreneurs in their respective countries. Wade was speaking at an event to promote the U.N. draft resolution ""Entrepreneurship for Development."" Sponsored by Israel's Mission to the U.N., the unprecedented resolution encourages countries to remove potential licensing, financial and legal barriers that prevent local businesses from stimulating widespread economic and social growth. It also emphasizes the value of teaching entrepreneurial skills at all levels of education, so that everyone—including youth and women—can turn their creativity, energy and ideas into business opportunities. The resolution had already garnered the support of 74 countries in advance of the discussion. It is scheduled for a vote on Friday. Support for this resolution is a no-brainer. Entrepreneurship is a powerful engine that can propel the global agenda forward. It is a major tool for reducing poverty, improving social conditions and confronting environmental challenges. It empowers people and generates solutions that help communities overcome old problems with new ways of thinking. It is an important driver of economic development, job creation and expanding opportunities for women and youth. Indeed, eight years ago, the Commission on Private Sector Development of the United Nations Development Program stated in a report that, ""It is about realizing that the poor entrepreneurs are as important a part of the private sector as the multinational corporation. ... It is about unleashing the power of the local entrepreneur to reduce poverty in their communities and nations."" But the benefits of entrepreneurship go beyond pure economics. As individuals become more self-sufficient and empowered, they are more likely to seek higher levels of education and better living conditions for themselves and their children. As President Paul Kagame of Rwanda put it, ""entrepreneurship is the surest way for a nation to meet its goals and to develop prosperity for the greatest number of people."" Those of us who work with social entrepreneurs know this statement to be spot on. Their projects involve an ever expanding amount of people from their community and as they replicate and scale their innovations, they cast an ever widening global net that involves hundreds, thousands and even millions more. Their goal is not so much to attract consumers of products but to attract change makers -- people they can empower to embrace social change and give themselves the means to become full economic citizens. Albina Ruiz, the founder of Lima-based Ciudad Saludable, is a poster child for the economic benefits of entrepreneurship that creates immense social value. She built a community-based waste management system that plays an increasingly important role in improving sanitation and health conditions in Peru and other Latin American countries. Albina developed an innovative chain of job- and income-generating micro-enterprises. Every stage of the waste management system, from the hiring of former garbage pickers (now recyclers), to the encouragement of a culture of paid garbage collection, and the transformation of garbage into saleable items that are sold in high-end stores creates a virtuous cycle of change that positively impacts her city. Started just 10 years ago, Ciudad Saludable now serves more than 3 million residents in the slums of Lima alone. The organization has spread across Peru and other countries in Latin America, employing hundreds of people, improving public health and the environment and contributing to the economic vitality of the communities and cities in which Ciudad Saludable and its many micro-enterprises operates. There is no better argument for supporting entrepreneurship worldwide. Israel's delegation deserves credit for engaging their fellow member countries in dialogue to encourage a global approach to promote entrepreneurship. The success of the resolution will provide a necessary pathway for stimulating future entrepreneurs and help equip world leaders to be better able to solve complex and fast-changing economic and social problems. To cultivate a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation everywhere - it will take a global village.

"(CNN) -- Alicia Rhett, who had been one of the oldest surviving cast member of the classic film ""Gone With the Wind,"" died Friday in her longtime hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, a retirement community spokeswoman said. Rhett passed away of natural causes around 5 p.m. surrounded by friends at Bishop Gadsden Episcopal Retirement Community, said Kimberly Farfone Borts, a spokeswoman for the community. She was 98. Born in Savannah, Georgia, Rhett moved with her mother to Charleston after her father died during World War I, according to Borts. Her roots to the South trace back even deeper: According to her biography on the Turner Classic Movies website -- which, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner -- she was the great-granddaughter of U.S. Sen. Robert Rhett, known as the ""Father of Secession"" for his staunch and vocal anti-Union positions. Rhett was doing local theater productions when she was spotted for a role in the 1939 classic ""Gone With the Wind,"" a film based on Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. She was cast as India Wilkes, sister of plantation owner Ashley Wilkes who was at odds with Scarlet O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh. While the runaway success and continued notoriety of ""Gone With the Wind"" made Rhett recognizable nationwide, she did not pursue the limelight. Instead of heading to Hollywood, Rhett went back to Charleston. In the coastal South Carolina city, she developed a reputation as a talented artist, producing works seen in the state library and in many plantations in the area, as well as sketches of her fellow ""Gone With the Wind"" cast members, according to Borts. Rhett never married and had a relatively quiet life, though she was involved in local arts programs.

"(CNN) -- Two small planes collided in the sky over a wooded area of New York state Monday afternoon, killing two people and critically injuring a third, authorities said. Federal Aviation Administration officials said they did not have details of what led to the collision, but said it involved two small Piper aircraft, a PA-24 and a PA-28. Orange County, New York, spokeswoman Orysia Dmytrenko said the two planes came down in a wooded area off County Route 12 in the town of Wawayanda, New York. The incident happened around 3 p.m. about 60 miles north-northwest of New York City.

"(CNN) -- Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was nearing the tomb of Pakistan's founding father when blasts struck near her convoy in Karachi, Pakistan, killing at least 124 people. Fire erupts from a car in front of the vehicle carrying former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Mohammed Ali Jinnah, who led Pakistan to independence and championed equal rights, stood for democracy and human rights. That Bhutto chose to visit his grave was an important symbolic move, said Akbar Ahmed, former Pakistani ambassador to the United Kingdom. ""The fact that she went to to Mr. Jinnah's mausoleum would send a message to Pakistanis ... that Jinnah remains the symbol of all Pakistan,"" he said. ""The fact that she selects Jinnah reemphasizes that she is taking a mainstream position in Pakistan politics."" She had planned to stop and pray at the tomb, then deliver a speech to her supporters. The streets were packed with people watching her motorcade pass. Bhutto and those with her were not injured in the attacks, and her companions said she reached her family home safely. The windshield of the vehicle she was riding in was smashed by the blasts, CNN's Dan Rivers said, and a vehicle that was following hers was totally burned out. The scene, he said, was ""absolutely horrendous,"" with blood literally running in streams down the street.  Watch how Bhutto escaped uninjured » . The blasts confirmed fears of instability linked to her return, which came after she reached a controversial agreement with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf that will allow her to seek re-election as prime minister. Many were bitterly opposed to that deal. ""This is what everyone feared,"" Rivers said. Ahmed said Musharraf, who is waiting to see if the Supreme Court confirm his eligibility as president, will most likely take this opportunity to strengthen his position. ""He will say, 'I told you so, He will tell Washington I told you so. He will tell Benazir Bhutto I told you so. This is not the time for you to come back, stay out let me handle the administration, let me be the strong man,' "" Ahmed said. Bhutto, 54, returned to the country Thursday after eight years of self-imposed exile. Earlier this month, Musharraf's office announced he had signed a ""reconciliation ordinance"" that dropped outstanding corruption charges against Bhutto and a number of other politicians.  See a timeline of Bhutto's life in politics » . Officials had warned Bhutto to delay her return because there were reports that some ""extremist elements were bent on hurting her, because she was seen as coming with an American agenda,"" said Tariq Azim Khan, Pakistan's information minister. It's unclear who was behind the blasts. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party considers the incident an assassination attempt against her, officials said. ""The primary suspects, of course, are the al Qaeda-Taliban alliances because they have named her as a primary target. She stands for democracy, she stands for a pro-Western position in Pakistan politics and, of course, her gender,"" Ahmed said. ""At the same time, don't forget there's a history of bad blood between her party and the intelligence services."" Bhutto told CNN just before returning to her homeland that she was aware of the risks and knew some people wished her harm, but ""I'm prepared to take them."" She did, however, tell CNN on Wednesday that she wrote Musharraf a letter naming those she feared would make an attempt on her life. Threats against her, she said, were made by ""certain people who have gained a lot through dictatorship. They have presided over the rise of extremism, they have created safe havens in the tribal areas of Pakistan for the Taliban and other militants and they fear my return."" Bhutto, daughter of deposed Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto -- served as prime minister from 1988 until 1990, when her government was dismissed amid corruption allegations that she denied. Her father, who founded the PPP, was executed in 1979. Bhutto returned to power in 1993, but again her government was dismissed amid corruption allegations in 1996.  E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some Democrats are increasingly concerned about President Obama's $787 billion financial fix for the ailing economy, and are demanding greater transparency on further spending. Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-North Dakota, says there are big concerns over talk about a second stimulus package. With the White House seemingly comparing the nation's economy to a house on fire, some congressional Democrats are asking, where's the fire truck? One New Hampshire congresswoman said as much to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner on Capitol Hill recently. ""I said, hurry, please hurry, because people are waiting and they are hurting, and they need the help now,"" Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-New Hampshire, said. She's one of a growing number of nervous Democrats on edge or at odds with some of the Obama's administration's plans on the economy. Some are taking aim at the president's budget proposals that would curb popular tax deductions for wealthier Americans.  Watch more on why some Democrats are nervous » . ""I don't think ultimately the criticism is surprising. That certainly happens and is all part of the process,"" said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. As a nod to moderate concerns, Obama took steps to make his budget more transparent. He included items former President George W. Bush passed separately in recent years to obscure the true operating cost of the government, such as the money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, an annual multibillion-dollar fix of the fees Medicare pays physicians and Alternative Minimum Tax relief for the middle class. Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Indiana, who along with Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson and Connecticut Independent Joe Lieberman is one of the so-called Gang of 15 -- a coalition of moderate Democratic senators -- says it's all about the messaging. ""Like getting health care costs under control is important to the economy and getting the deficit down,"" he said. ""Sustainable sources of energy at reasonable prices is also important to the economy. Dealing with the financial crisis is obviously important to the economy."" Bayh added: ""So what needs to be done is, Obama's got to move on all these fronts but also integrate them back to the same theme of always strengthening the economy, getting people to work, growing businesses, improving our standard of living.""  Watch more of Obama's solutions for the economy » . Rep. John Tanner, D-Tennessee, is a member of the ""Blue Dog"" group of 47 fiscally conservative Democrats in the House -- six of whom voted against Obama's stimulus plan. He said Obama at least is being honest about the dire condition of the economy. ""At least the budget that the Obama administration presented, even though it's huge and it's a huge deficit -- and that enables the other team to beat up on it -- the truth is that it's honest and truthful,"" he said. Democratic media consultant Steve Murphy, who represents several moderate Democrats, said that Blue Dogs are all ""deficit hawks,"" so they're ""nervous about spending."" ""They're against giving more money to the banks without any accountability, they want to zero in on wasteful spending and they strongly believe the shrinking deficit and eventual balanced budget was the underpinning of our economic success in the '90's,"" he said. Murphy added that these Democrats do, however, realize that more money is going to be needed. ""So I expect them to be about greater accountability and fairness for the taxpayer. They won't join [GOP House Minority Whip Eric] Cantor's 'Hell No' chorus."" And that is something resonating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who said top economists told her a second stimulus package may be necessary. ""You have to keep the door open to see how this goes,"" she said. House Democrats, CNN has learned, heard that message in a meeting with top economists, who predicted the president's  stimulus plan will fall short of saving or creating three to four million jobs, as he promised. ""Over the first two years about 2 1/2 million jobs saved and created,"" said economist Allen Sinai. ""A little less than the administration and perhaps Speaker Pelosi has said ... the jobs created may be a little disappointing."" Sinai said that over time, the economy may produce the jobs president Obama promised, but that people should try to be patient. But budget hawks in the party don't like the sound of that. ""I mean, if we were to take a vote this afternoon, the stimulus package would probably fail,"" said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-North Dakota. ""If they want substantial, more public funds committed, they're going to have to go out there and explain precisely how this is going to work."" Shea-Porter said she's simply on the message she's getting at town meetings back home, a message that's also aimed at some in the media. ""It's terrifying people. Before, people were very optimistic and the leaders were optimistic. Then we hit a spell here where we're hearing a lot of media ... people who are frightening without necessarily giving both sides,"" she added. For now, the White House says it has no plans for another stimulus, arguing its plan needs time to work. In other words, the fire is not out yet.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- While Justin Bieber decompresses on a Panama beach after a wild week in Miami, a prosecutor will decide if the teen pop star will face a felony charge in Los Angeles. Detectives who went frame by frame over security video seized from Bieber's California mansion are close to carrying their egg attack evidence to the Los Angeles district attorney for a decision. While Bieber's drunken driving arrest in Miami Beach on Thursday earned him his first mug shot, a felony vandalism case could be the biggest threat to Bieber's freedom and ability to tour the world. ""We will have a dialogue with the district attorney and determine, based on what we have, when we should bring the case over,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson told CNN on Friday. ""We will then take the case to the D.A. It will be up to them to file charges and what charges at that time."" Bieber's bad behavior . Although a felony could carry jail time, probation appears much more likely if Bieber is ultimately convicted. Chris Brown, who pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna on the eve of the Grammys five years ago avoided time in a California jail despite the violence involved in the beating of his girlfriend. But the five years of probation for Brown has proven to be a major hindrance to his music career. He is now in court-ordered rehab for three months and will have to spend several days each week until August working on a community labor crew to complete his probation requirements. 5 questions about the case . As with actress Lindsay Lohan, Brown has been found in violation of probation rules several times, resulting in additional travel limitations, rehab stints and work requirements. Probation could have Bieber walking on egg shells for several years if he is convicted of launching eggs over a fence onto his neighbor's mansion. His probation officer would possibly have to approve any travel outside of California, which could hamper the world touring that contributes to his income and fame. Although Breathalyzer tests suggest Bieber was not too drunk to legally drive when he was pulled over by Miami Beach police early Thursday, it could be two or three weeks before tests are back from the lab which should give a more accurate blood-alcohol reading and could tell if he was high on pot. Bieber blew .011 and .014 in two Breathalyzer tests given to him at the police station, according to a source with knowledge of the results. Florida's legal limit for drivers under the drinking age of 21 is .02. The police report said that Bieber failed a field sobriety test given to him at the police station. He admitted to drinking, using marijuana and taking prescription pills, police said. Bieber has a 'frat house' amidst millionaire mansions . The Miami prosecutor said no date has been set yet for Bieber to return to court on the DUI, resisting arrest and expired license charges. Although Bieber was not charged with speeding, the arresting officer said it was his reason for stopping Bieber and testing his sobriety. The head of the exotic car rental company that owns the yellow Lamborghini he was driving told CNN on Saturday that the GPS tracking system in the high-performance car indicated that Bieber never exceeded 55 mph in the 15 minutes before the stop. The Breathalyzer tests and the GPS information could help Bieber lawyer Roy Black in his defense of the singer. Bieber fled Miami late Friday, boarding a private jet for a flight to Panama City, Panama. Paparazzi photos showed Bieber strolling along a beach on the Pacific Ocean on Saturday, kicking a soccer ball while others kite surfed above the waves. He could learn this week if his next trip is to a Los Angeles courtroom. Opinion: Money and Bieber's teenage brain .

"(CNN) -- Fourteen months after she was left paralyzed by a pool mishap at her bachelorette party, Rachelle Friedman is having the wedding of her dreams Friday -- and then some. Joining Friedman and fiance Chris Chapman will be between 100 and 120 family members and their closest friends, witnesses to the couple's can-do spirit. ""It just feels like a love story to people,"" said Rachelle's mother, Carol. ""They are really great together."" Wednesday was a day of continued wedding preparations for Friedman, 25, of Knightdale, North Carolina, just east of Raleigh. The quadriplegic in recent weeks has practiced for the couple's first dance, a special moment even if she will be in her wheelchair. Friedman's father, Larry, will push her down the aisle, so that she can hold a bridal bouquet as she approaches Chapman, 28. ""I can't compare our relationship to anyone else,"" she said. ""I am super lucky to find that perfect love I wish everyone had."" For Friedman, life is about moving forward and gaining increased independence. When asked how the accident changed her life, the bride-to-be says, ""I don't really think about what would have been."" Friedman and Chapman, a middle school science teacher, were to wed June 27, 2010. In late May, Friedman, who was a program coordinator for a senior citizens center, traveled to their hometown of Virginia Beach, Virginia, for her bachelorette party. Bridesmaids enjoyed a cookout and a limousine ride to the entertainment strip with bridesmaids. ""We had a really good time,"" the East Carolina University graduate said in November. Afterward, the group went to her best friend's home, where they started playing around near the pool. ""It was just spontaneous horseplay,"" said Friedman, a former dance and aerobics dancer. Her best friend ""pushed me, and I landed wrong."" The young woman's head struck the bottom of the pool, which had a few feet of water in it. Friedman, who suffered a spinal cord injury and paralysis from the chest down, has remained close to the friend through the trauma each suffered. ""We're there for each other,"" Friedman said. ""It could easily have been the other way around."" Chapman and Friedman put off the wedding during her initial rehabilitation and while they tried to figure out medical coverage. They were concerned that she may not qualify for Medicaid if she married, but they since learned she was ineligible. A $500-a-month COBRA policy and long-term disability have helped. Individuals, businesses and foundations have provided other assistance. After CNN wrote about the couple and HLN's Vinnie's Politan interviewed Friedman, a wedding and honeymoon planning company approached the couple. ""It blew me away, how upbeat and positive she is,"" said Donne Kerestic, CEO of 1-800-Registry, based in Nevada. Working with vendors and two wedding planners, Kerestic's company is paying for Friedman's wedding and the couple's honeymoon in Fiji. 1-800-Registry is incurring between $50,000 and $60,000 in costs, Kerestic said Wednesday. Chapman and Friedman will exchange vows at 11 a.m. Friday at Fearrington Village in Pittsboro, North Carolina. The complex, which features an inn, restaurant and other features, has an upscale rural theme. Friedman, who likes country music, is excited about having a band and deejay at the reception, planned at a large barn. She'll be wearing the same dress she planned to wear last summer. ""It's perfect,"" she said of the nuptial plans. While she still has dreams of being able to walk one day, Friedman focuses now on increasing her strength and possibly regaining feeling in her hands. She's been working on her ability to ""transfer"" herself into bed or a car. She uses her thumbs to type on a keyboard. The recreation management major plays wheelchair ""quad rugby"" for the Raleigh Sidewinders and has spoken at several venues, including an adaptive sports and wellness day, where people with disabilities were exposed to sports like kayaking, basketball and rugby. Carol Friedman and Rachelle's 32-year-old brother help her during the week while Chapman is at work. Besides paralysis, Friedman deals with nerve pain and blood pressure problems.

The accident introduced them to new friends and brought their families closer together.

The Walking With Anthony Foundation is covering the costs for Rachelle and Carol Friedman, said Gigi Betancourt, client services manager at Project Walk. The nonprofit center's aim is helping patients improve their function below their injury level, build strength and find hope, said Eric Harness, head of research and development. Patients do exercises outside of their wheelchairs. Friedman would eventually like to return to work, perhaps encouraging others as a speaker. ""Rachelle is a very motivated person,"" said Miranda Strider-Allen, program director at Resources for Seniors, where Friedman helped provide services to Wake County senior and disabled adults. ""It's amazing -- her frame of mind and positive attitude."" ""My hope is she finds her new niche in life,"" Carol Friedman said of her daughter.

"(CNN) -- In the old days, being passive-aggressive took effort. An annoyance -- like, say, a neighbor who has elected to make the stairwell his own personal broom closet -- would fester and fester until one was finally forced into action. IE, leaving a note to the effect of: ""Hi! I tripped over a bucket of liquid in the hallway and turned my ankle. Therefore, I elected to remove your garbage from our common area -- for the sake of everyone's safety. Thanks! :D 3B. P.S. Everyone can hear you have sex through the wall."" Now, it's all too easy to vent your frustrations via Twitter, Facebook and various and sundry meme machines, cluttering the newsfeeds of friends and ""Facebook friends"" with your petty, petty gripes. We get it: Sometimes you just need to scream silently into your pillow, and since one does not always have a pillow on hand (unless one rolls like that), the Web is often the closest substitute. Still, it is vital to realize that you are not, in fact, bellowing into the ether about your co-worker's apparent lack of breathing-through-the-nose skills -- no, you are recording these grievances for all to see, laugh at and possibly garner a book deal via passive-aggressive notes. Thankfully, the Web (and its outlying regions) is an innovative place, and now it's possible to get passive-aggressive (and even outright aggressive) without spreading your lack of sunshine to the rest of your social network. Here's what to do: . When your friends are being all foe-like . The other weekend, you had a rather unfortunate drunken experience with a fire extinguisher at a local music venue. The next day, you confided in your friend -- let's call him ""Steve"" -- who immediately appropriated the venue's security camera footage and posted your incriminating, foamy dance (you were belting out a stirring rendition of ""We Didn't Start the Fire,"" you now recall) to YouTube. You became a viral star! -- for all the wrong reasons. Angrily, you take to Facebook and start posting messages akin to, ""NOW I KNOW WHO MY REAL FRIENDS ARE!"" Sorry to break it to you, dude, but acting out digitally in this way makes you look like a giant loser -- not that you needed any help in the first place. Naturally, you should probably confront your friend, but if you can't manage to summon up the balls to do so, might we suggest downloading Face-Invaders, an iPad game that allows you to blast your Facebook friends in effigy as if they were malignant aliens from outer space. ""Steve"" will never know what hit him -- unless you manage to get your hands on another fire extinguisher. When your beau is being a schmo . So here's the thing. Everything about you and your girlfriend makes us intensely uncomfortable: the way you (wetly) make out in public, the way you lick sauce off of each other's face while eating, and, especially, the way you get into raging fights in public locations and then retreat into the nearest restroom to ""make up."" And when you port all of that over into the digital realm, snipping about fights and seeking support from your friends (""He's just not good enough for you, girl!"") we're just that much more embarrassed for you because it's all out there for anyone to see (Openbook is watching). Luckily, someone has gone and created an application called Pair especially for couples, allowing Jack and Jill to share pictures, videos, texts and drawings with each other -- and each other alone. So the next time you feel tempted to bring up Jack's inability to purchase TP via incensed tweet, snap a pic of the naked roll and send it along to J instead. Bonus: The app also has a ""thumb kiss"" feature that causes the phone to vibrate when both couples touch their appendages to their screens at the same time. It's like really discreet makeup sex. NB: This app is intended to be used by happy couples, but we're cynics. When your boss is eating your soul . Wait until you get home and pull out the aforementioned pillow. Seriously. While we're all about free speech and all that, it's just basically a bad idea to post anything disparaging about your boss or workplace online. Why? Because you never know who has access to your social accounts -- a lot of workplaces are even asking for Facebook logins nowadays (a practice that we wholly do not endorse). If you're that upset about your current work situation, by all means get smashed and complain about it with friends (after looking over your shoulder, of course). But after you've recovered from your hangover, maybe start looking for another gig. If you must let off some steam, try firing up Enemy Graph, a Facebook app that allows you to declare friends or public figures ""enemies."" We hear Justin Bieber is a popular enemy, and there's slim to no chance he's your boss.","Face-Invaders is an iPad game that allows you to blast your Facebook friends in effigy .

"New York (CNN) -- The world's most valuable book sold Tuesday for $14.16 million at Sotheby's in New York, according to the auction house. The rare Bay Psalm Book is the first book ever written and printed in what is now the United States. Its sale set a record for a book sold at auction, Sotheby's said. Philanthropist David Rubenstein purchased one of 11 surviving copies. He ""plans to share it with the American public by loaning it to libraries across the country, before putting it on long-term loan at one of them,"" according to Sotheby's. The Bay Psalm Book is a translation of the biblical psalms by the Puritans and was an important part of their church service. ""It's so very valuable because it is the beginning of Western civilization in our country,"" said David Redden, vice chairman of Sotheby's. ""In fact, it is the first poetry in America -- it's as simple as that."" Currently, the 11 surviving versions of the 1,700 originally printed are in institutional collections, including Harvard, Yale, Oxford, the New York Public Library and the Huntington Library in California. The book auctioned Tuesday is from the collection of the Old South Church in Boston, Massachusetts, which had it for more than 300 years. It is one of two copies in their possession, with the sale intended to support its mission and ministry in Boston. Congregationalist Puritans, who settled around Massachusetts Bay in search of religious freedom, wanted to translate and produce a version of the Book of Psalms closer to the Hebrew original than the one they had brought over from England. The first edition of the Bay Psalm Book was printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tuesday's sale is the first time since 1947 and the second time since 1894 that a copy has appeared at auction. In 1947, it achieved a higher price than any other book printed at the time, when Sotheby's sold it for $151,000. ""This little book of 1640 was a precursor to Lexington and Concord, and, ultimately, to American political independence,"" Redden said. ""With it, New England declared its independence from the Church of England."" Tuesday's sale eclipses the previous auction record for a printed book, at Sotheby's London, when a copy of John James Audubon's Birds of America sold for $11.5 million in 2010, the auction house said.

"(CNN) -- The mother of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman filed a civil lawsuit against the boy's stepmother Friday, alleging she is responsible for his disappearance and demanding she reveal his whereabouts. The suit also seeks damages of $10 million. ""I hope that I am wrong, but I fear that he is gone forever,"" said Kyron's mother, Desiree Young. Her son was last seen on June 4, 2010, inside his Oregon elementary school. His stepmother, Terri Horman, told police that she'd dropped off the boy that morning at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. Mystery, pain linger after Oregon boy went missing . ""I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is. I believe that Terri Horman is responsible for where my son is. The time has come for Terri to take responsibility for what she has done and to tell me and my family where Kyron is and how he got there,"" said Young, struggling to speak through tears. Any money recovered through the suit will go toward helping families and parents of other missing children, she said. Since Kyron's disappearance, most of the speculation has focused on the boy's stepmother. Parents plea for Kyle Horman . In August 2010, investigators solicited the public's help for information about the location of the white pickup truck that she is believed to have driven the morning of then-7-year-old Kyron's disappearance. And in divorce filings, the boy's father, Kaine Horman, said he believes his estranged wife, Terri Horman, ""is involved"" in the boy's disappearance. Court documents also allege Terri Horman tried to hire a man to kill her husband. Searching with dread for missing children . Still, no charges have been filed against anyone in the case, nor has anyone officially been named as a suspect -- including Terri Horman. On Friday, Horman's attorney released a statement, declining to comment on the suit. ""Until such time as I have had an opportunity to thoroughly review the complaint, I will not be making any public statement with respect to this matter,"" Stephen Houze said in a statement. The civil suit was filed when it was because there is a two-year statute of limitations on such claims, said Young's lawyer Elden Rosenthal. There is no such statute for a murder charge in the criminal justice system, he said, stressing his client's belief that criminal charges will eventually be filed against Horman. ""Until I can bring Kyron home, I will not rest. It's time for there to be answers,"" said Young.","The suit alleges the stepmother is responsible for the disappearance of Kyron Horman .

"(CNN) -- Just as the politics of oil shaped the 20th century industrial economy, so the politics of data will shape the 21st century digital economy. At this week's Digital Life Design (DLD), a prestigious technology conference held annually in Munich, the fault lines of the political debate about data were exposed by the event's two keynote speakers: The European Commission's vice president for justice, Viviane Reding, and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Reding and Sandberg were in agreement about one thing: personal data is the new oil, the vital fuel of our digital economy. But that's about all they agreed on at DLD. In every other respect, their priorities and agendas represent the bookends of an increasingly fractious debate that is pitting European politicians like Reding against American social media networks such as Sandberg's Facebook. Reding's focus is on the consumer's control of their own data. ""Personal data is the currency of today's digital market. And like any currency, it needs stability and trust,"" Reding argued in the opening keynote of the conference. That ""stability"" and ""trust"", she believes, can only be won by legislating in favor of consumers' ability to protect their personal data. The great threat to individual liberty in the digital age, Reding argued at DLD, comes from companies that use our data to enrich themselves -- buying and selling our most intimate details for their own corporate benefit. Individual privacy in today's networked age, she argued, can only be protected by tighter legislation on what companies can do with our data and by more aggressive data-protection officers and agencies. To this end, Reding is introducing legislation which will give consumers the right to be forgotten on online social networks like Facebook and Twitter . ""The journey has only just begun"", Sandberg told the DLD audience in the final speech of the event. But this is a journey-- of a data revolution driven by powerful social networks like Facebook -- that Sandberg, in contrast with Reding, relishes. What we do online is increasingly who we are, she said. ""We are our real identities online."" Rather than wanting to be forgotten, Sandberg believes that we all want to be remembered. All this personal data empowers us, Facebook's second most powerful executive insisted. It represents a shift to what she called ""authentic identity,"" from the wisdom of the crowd to ""wisdom of our friends."" Above all, she said, it turns all of us from being passive receivers of other people's information into active broadcasters of our own lives. The digital data revolution is ""a really big deal,"" Sandberg insisted at DLD. It represents a profound shift in the balance of power between institutions and individuals. The sharing of information reshapes our lives; it brings us together and empowers us. And it makes us richer too, she argued, suggesting that Facebook alone had created 230,000 jobs and is even committed to giving 50,000 European small businesses â‚¬100 euros ($130) apiece to develop their social identities. Reding and Sandberg's presentations represented the first and last speeches of the three day event. But their speeches were separated by more than just 72 hours. There's a gulf, perhaps even an inseparable chasm, between the two women's assumptions about both the value and role of personal data in our increasingly digital society. I'm not sure if Sandberg is correct to argue that the digital journey of the 21st century is only just beginning. But I am pretty certain that this debate about the politics of data will run and run in a world in which personal data is increasingly the oil powering our digitally connected economy. Internet: An engine of progress or hate? There was much talk at DLD about the internet representing a historic shift of power -- from the nation-state to the 21st century empowered individual. From Alec Ross, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's special Advisor on innovation, to Katie Stanton, Twitter's head of global innovation, and to Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, the DLD core message was that the internet represented a vehicle of democratic progress and global toleration. The DLD message of openness and toleration was also reflected in the event itself. Hosted by the Munich-based publishing mogul Hubert Burda and the legendary Israeli networker Yossi Vardi, DLD brought together peoples from all over the world and included speakers from Turkey, Libya, Japan, and Russia as well as from Europe and the United States. The speakers' dinner was even held in the Hubert Burda Hall of Munich's Jewish Community Center, a building distinguished by both its spacious architecture and its wonderful acoustics. So it was particularly ironic that the German parliament released a report earlier this week showing that anti-Semitism remained ""deeply rooted"" in German society and that the Internet is playing a central role in spreading the unspeakable lie of Holocaust denial. Blaming the internet for anti-Semitism is, of course, like blaming printing press inventor Johannes Gutenberg for Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. And yet it's hard to avoid concluding that the Internet isn't quite the engine of progress that Sandberg, Ross or Wales believe it is. Nor is it the den of pure iniquity that critics like myself have sometimes argued. Turn on, log on, drop out . Neither Mark Zuckerberg nor fellow Facebook founder Sean Parker were at DLD, so it was left to Tumblr's CEO David Karp to wow of this year's conference with his youthful exuberance. His speech, with its acknowledgment that Tumblr was ""an accidental social network"" whose remarkable success has been built on what he calls the network's ""curators,"" was one of the most admired of the event. I had dinner with Karp and found him to be a disarmingly impressive young man. A New York City high school dropout who never attended college, lived for a while in Japan, and started his first company in his teens, Karp has that entrepreneurial quality of being both refreshingly humble and yet uncannily poised. With Twitter creator Jack Dorsey, he is a good bet to inherit Zuckerberg's mantle of the world's most charismatic young start-up entrepreneur. Karp also joins that pantheon of start-up entrepreneurs -- from Steve Jobs and Bill Gates to Zuckerberg -- who have dropped out of school to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. This is no coincidence. Traditional education is failing to stimulate remarkably innovative young men like Karp. Perhaps PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel is right. We really should be paying unusually talented kids like Karp to drop out of college. â€¢ Follow @ajkeen on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- The Army announced Tuesday that a sergeant first class assigned to an assault prevention program at Fort Hood, Texas, is under investigation for sexual assault. The soldier, who was not named in an Army statement, has been suspended from all duties. Specifically, the soldier is under investigation for ""pandering, abusive sexual contact, assault and maltreatment of subordinates,"" the statement said. Special agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command are conducting the probe. No charges have been filed. ""This is so contrary to everything upon which the Army was built,"" Secretary of the Army John McHugh said during testimony before the House Appropriations Committee Defense subcommittee, according to the statement. ""To see this kind of activity happening in our ranks is really heart-wrenching and sickening."" McHugh spoke generally about sex abuse crimes in the military. Army investigates trend in military sexual assaults . ""As I said to our new Brigadier General Corps when I spoke to them about two weeks ago, 'You can do everything from this point forward in your military career perfectly, but if you fail on this, you have failed the Army',"" he reportedly said. The solider was assigned as a Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention program coordinator when the allegations surfaced. ""There is a distinct possibility,"" that some sort of prostitution-related activity was involved, an administration official told CNN. But investigators have not yet determined the scope of that possibility or the potential criminal misconduct. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was made aware of the case earlier Tuesday. He met with McHugh and directed him to ensure that ""all of those who might be involved are dealt with appropriately,"" according to Pentagon spokesman George Little. ""I cannot convey strongly enough his frustration, anger and disappointment over these troubling allegations and the breakdown in discipline and standards they imply,"" Little said about his boss. ""To address the broader concerns that have arisen out of these allegations and other recent events, Secretary Hagel is directing all the services to retrain, recredential, and rescreen all sexual assault prevention and response personnel and military recruiters,"" he said. After sex assault case, Hagel seeks changes to military legal process . According to a Pentagon report released last week, the number of service members anonymously reporting a sexual assault grew by more than 30% in the past two years. The Defense Department estimated that more than 26,000 troops experienced an episode of ""unwanted sexual contact,"" a huge jump from 19,300 in the 2010 report. The actual number of sexual crimes reported in fiscal year 2012 was 3,374, a 6% increase over the previous year, the report said. Military officials worry that many victims don't come forward because they fear retaliation. But the numbers might indicate that more victims are willing to report crimes than in the past. ""I am outraged and disgusted by the reports out of Fort Hood today,"" said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard P. ""Buck"" McKeon, calling them the ""latest chapter in a long, sordid history of sexual abuse"" in the military. The California Republican has a granddaughter in the Army. ""I see no meaningful distinction between complacency or complicity in the military's latest failure to uphold their own standards of conduct. Nor do I see a distinction between the service member who orchestrated this offense and the chain of command that was either oblivious to or tolerant of criminal behavior,"" he said. Military rape victims: Stop blaming us . The allegations of abuse come soon after an Air Force officer was charged with sexual battery stemming from an incident in Northern Virginia. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, was arrested this month and accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County not far from the Pentagon. He had been in charge of a military unit aimed at preventing sexual assault. Krusinski, who has since been removed from that position, made an initial court appearance last week. He did not enter a plea. ""To say this report is disturbing would be a gross understatement. For the second time in a week, we are seeing someone who is supposed to be preventing sexual assault being investigated for committing that very act,"" said U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York. She plans to unveil legislation this week that would remove chain of command influence from the prosecution of such offenses. ""We have the best and the brightest serving in our military. We have the greatest military in the world. And we ask everything of them. We ask them to even die for their country. We should not be allowing them to be subject to sexual assault and rape,"" said Gillibrand. After top Air Force officer charged in sex assault, military faces questions . CNN's Barbara Starr, Larry Shaughnessy, Steve Almasy and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: Prostitution-related activity may have been involved, says an official .

"New York (CNN) -- New York is set to become the latest state to open the door for medical marijuana, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo to take executive action to let select hospitals dispense it to select patients, according to two advocates briefed on the plan. State Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, who has been a leading proponent of more comprehensive legislation for medical marijuana in New York, said he learned about the executive action in a conversation Saturday afternoon with members of the governor's staff. It paves the way for a ""limited and cumbersome program,"" but nonetheless is a step forward on the issue, according to Gottfried. ""I'm thrilled that the governor has taken this action,"" the assemblyman said. ""This is a very key interim step."" News of the governor's initiative was first reported by The New York Times. Cuomo's office did not respond Saturday to CNN's requests for comment on the matter. Medical marijuana is hardly unprecedented in the United States. Twenty states and the District of Columbia now allow it in some form -- among them Colorado, where as of January 1 it's legal to sell marijuana to those 21 or older -- according to info compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. (In addition, Maryland has a limited program for research.) The momentum has picked up of late, with most of these efforts taking effect over the past decade. The states where there is medical marijuana include Connecticut, Vermont and New Jersey, each of which border New York. And yet the Empire State has not joined them. Versions of the Compassionate Care Act pushed by Gottfried have passed the state Assembly, only to stall in the Senate. Cuomo is acting without the legislature's OK, though what he's doing is legal, according to Gottfried, whose district includes much of Midtown Manhattan. He explained that the governor is acting on powers granted through a law passed in 1980 in setting the stage for a highly regulated system that's less liberal than many other medical marijuana setups nationwide. Here's how it would work, according to Gottfried: Under Cuomo's directive, the state health department would take charge by setting up the guidelines and picking hospitals that would take part. These hospitals would then have panels of people who decide, on a person-by-person basis, which patients qualify for medical marijuana. It has yet to be determined where the medical marijuana -- or the elements of it that might be dispensed -- will come from, including who might produce it. Gottfried estimated that tens of thousands of people could get medical marijuana by virtue of this policy change, though he insisted it is no substitute for a more complete, far-reaching program. ""(Cuomo) can take (this step) without the need for further legislation,"" the Manhattan legislator said. ""But to have a truly comprehensive and well-working system will take legislation."" Gabriel Sayegh -- the New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, which describes itself as a ""national advocacy leader of drug law reform"" -- agrees, saying that it too will push for broader medical marijuana laws in the state. He learned about this latest measure in a call Saturday from the governor's office, saying the proposal originated there and describing it the same basic way as Gottfried. Even as he pushes for something bigger, Sayegh praised the governor for taking what he called an ""exciting"" initial step. ""It's tremendous,"" Sayegh said. ""We applaud him coming out on this. It's going to help us build momentum to build a permanent program."" CNN's Kristina Sgueglia reported from New York, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- There's a lot to look forward to in the last week of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, including individual event finals for men's and women's gymnastics. Can all-around women's champ Gabby Douglas add to her gold tally in Monday's uneven bars? Who will reign supreme in the men's 400 meters, for which South Africa's Oscar Pistorius, the Olympics' first double amputee runner, failed to qualify. Here are five things to look for Monday at the 2012 London Games: . 1. Track and field: Who wins the men's 400 meters is anybody's guess. Since 1920, and with the exception of the Moscow Games which it boycotted, the United States has won a medal in the 400 meters at every Olympic game. Not so this year. Bolt sprints to Olympic gold . A hamstring injury forced LaShawn Merritt, the gold medalist in the event in Beijing, to pull out in the semifinals. And South Africa's Oscar Pistorius, the Olympics' first double amputee runner, failed to qualify. The favorite to win is Lalonde Gordon of Trinidad and Tobago, who posted the fastest time in the semis on Sunday. The race will take place at 9:30 p.m. London time. (4:30 p.m. ET) 2. Gymnastics: Gabby's golden chance . Everyone's favorite 'it' girl, Douglas, will try to add to her medal haul in the final for the uneven bars. But she will have to outdo Elizabeth Tweddle of Great Britain, He Kexin of China and Victoria Komova of Russia. Murray beats Federer to take gold . The uneven bar final takes place at 2:50 p.m. (9:50 a.m. ET) 3. Diving: China looks to extend gold streak . China has already claimed five of eight gold medals up for grabs at the diving pool in London. It looks to make it six in the 3-meter springboard with He Chong, the current world champion. He faces stiff competition from fellow teammate Qin Kai as well as from a pair of Russians, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Ilya Zakharov. Americans Troy Dumais and Chris Colwill, who won the bronze in the 3-meter synchronized springboard, are also considered possible medal contenders. Opinion: Americans missing best Olympic stories . The springboard preliminary round takes place at 7 p.m. (2 p.m. ET). 4. Track and field: New Zealand's forgotten champ . Defending Olympic shot put champion Valerie Adams of New Zealand looks to defend her title after the New Zealand Olympic Committee forgot to register her for the event in London. The New Zealand committee moved quickly to resolve the error and include the heavily favored Adams, who has won three consecutive world titles. American gold medals . The shot put final takes place at 7:15 p.m. (2:15 p.m ET) 5. Basketball: NBA stars meet Argentina's top guns . The U.S. men's basketball team, populated with NBA stars, is facing off against Argentina, helmed by Manu Ginobili, Carlos Delfino and Luis Scola. In an exhibition game in July against Argentina ahead of the Olympics, the U.S. team beat Argentina 86-80. The game is the last of the round of group play before the start of the quarterfinals.

"London (CNN) -- Olympics fans will revel in track and field's most anticipated event Sunday, and the men's 100 meters will not lack for drama as Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt attempts to defend his title against his fellow countryman. Bolt became a household name with his gold medal win in the 2008 Beijing Games. His compatriot, Yohan Blake, is proving to be his main competition as they face off Sunday evening . Americans Tyson Gay, Justin Gatlin and Ryan Bailey will also be in the men's 100 final. Among the first events of the day is the women's marathon, which will pit favorites Mary Keitany from Kenya against Russian Liliya Shobukhova. Noticeably absent from the race will be world record holder Paula Radcliffe, from Great Britain, who withdrew citing a recent injury. In one of tennis' most anticipated showdowns, World No. 1 Roger Federer faces hometown favorite Andy Murray, whom he defeated at Wimbledon last month. Federer, who has 17 grand slam titles under his belt, is hoping to complete a career golden grand slam. Only Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal have achieved the feat of claiming a full set of grand slam titles and backed it it with Olympic gold in the singles. Sunday's events follow an action-packed Saturday that saw the host nation rake in six wins, bringing its gold medal count to 14. Only China and the United States have more. Jessica Ennis earned the heptathlon gold, Greg Rutherford scored a long jump win and Mo Farah's sprint to victory made him the first British runner ever to do so in the 10,000 meter competition. Meanwhile, the U.S. leads the gold medal count with 26 among its 54 total medals. China is second with 25 golds and 53 overall. But history on Saturday also favored the leaders, as the most decorated Olympian of all time tallied another win with his American teammates in the 4 x 100-meter medley relay, handing Michael Phelps his 18th gold medal in the last race of his storied swimming career. The U.S. win put an already unsurpassed Phelps at 22 total medals over three Olympic Games: 18 gold, two silver and two bronze. Japan placed second in Saturday's race, while Australia finished third. In the last day of London's swimming competition, the American women won the 4x100-meter medley relay race, setting a new world record with a time of 3:52.05. Australia netted silver. Sun Yang also added to China's growing gold tally with a win in the men's 1500-meter freestyle. Ryan Cochrane of Canada finished second, while Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia took bronze. But on the hardwood Saturday, U.S. Olympic command seemed far less convincing. Team USA squeaked past Lithuania in a preliminary round basketball contest, winning by just five points after trailing by two in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter -- the first scare for the favored American squad after a series of dominating performances that had bolstered an aura of invincibility. Elsewhere in London, Serena Williams completed a ""career Golden Slam"" at the 2012 Games, adding for the United States an Olympic women's singles tennis gold medal to her four tennis major titles. Also on the track, double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who runs on special carbon fiber blades and is nicknamed ""The Blade Runner,"" came in an impressive second in his heat of the men's individual 400-meter race, thus qualifying for Sunday's semifinals. He is the first person to compete in the able-bodied Olympics using prosthetic legs -- and he will also compete in the Paralympics later this summer.

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt bids to become the first man to win the Olympic sprint double twice while World Cup champ Japan seeks to win a second major soccer title. Here are five things to watch at the Olympics on Thursday: . 1) Men's 200 meters: Jamaica vs. Jamaica . Before you go giving Bolt the gold medal, Yohan Blake has something he wants to say. ""I'm not really focusing on beating him. I'm concentrating on running my race. My plan is just to execute,"" says the Jamaican champion. Wallace Spearmon of the United States will try to spoil the race, but after Blake and Bolt looked so impressive in their heats, it's hard to see anyone challenging the training partners and friends. When athletes succeed, but judges fail . Final is at 8:55 p.m. London time (3:55 p.m. ET) 2) Soccer: U.S. looks for revenge in the Olympic final, again . The World Cup ""loss"" in 2011 was one of the most heartbreaking results ever for the U.S. women. The U.S. led with nine minutes left in regulation and with three minutes left in extra time but lost the penalty-kick shootout to Japan 3-1 (the match result is deemed a draw). The Americans, twice World Cup champs and three times winners of the Olympics, have several factors going for them in their revenge bid. No World Cup champion has ever won the Olympics the next year. And since 1995, each time a team has knocked the United States out of World Cup, they've met in the Olympics a year later. The United States has won every time, twice in the final. Sex, Games and Olympic Village life . Gold medal match begins at 7:45 p.m. London time (2:45 p.m. ET). 3) Decathlon: Eaton needs a good nap . Ashton Eaton appears ready to grab the title of world's greatest athlete that comes with winning the Olympic decathlon title. After the first day of the competition, the world record holder in the event had a nice 220-point lead over his countryman Trey Hardee. You'd think Eaton would be thrilled after breaking the Olympic record for the decathlon 100 meters and topping the pack in three events. Not so, after all, he's only halfway home. And after a 12-hour day, he was in a hurry to go get some sleep. ""So far I am somewhat satisfied. I am in a good position. It has been a long day,"" he said. Jessica Ennis: I'd do it for nothing . The first of the five events on Day 2, the 110-meter hurdles, is at 9 a.m. London time (4 a.m. ET) 4) Women's water polo: Upstarts vs. U.S. Perhaps the fourth time will be the charm for the United States. Since women's water polo became an Olympic sport in 2000, the Americans have medaled three times, but none are gold. Teenager Maggie Steffens leads the United States with 16 goals against Spain, which has never won a major tournament. Spain is led by Anni Espar Llaquet, who has 13 goals. The gold medal match is at 8 p.m. London time (3 p.m. ET). Water polo placement matches begin at 2:30 p.m. London time (9:30 a.m. ET) 5) Women's 4x100-meter relay: Trying to get a handle . Passing the relay baton seems like it should be an easy thing to do. But in the past two Olympics (and several world championships) the U.S. women have botched a pass and not finished a race. The Americans begin their London quest with a qualifying heat Thursday night. Jeneba Tarmoh, who passed on a runoff for a place in the 100 meters after tying Allyson Felix at the U.S. trials, is part of the six-member pool. She might run in the early rounds. But Tarmoh ran with an ""A"" relay squad in a tuneup meet and the result was familiar: a missed handoff. Felix floors Jamaican rivals .

"(CNN) -- Brandon ""Lil B"" McCartney is no stranger to making bold statements. In front of thousands of concert-goers at April's Coachella Music and Arts Festival, the 21-year-old rap artist announced that he would name one of his future albums ""I'm Gay."" So, what's the big deal? Well, for starters, Lil B is not gay. And although it'd be easy to write him off as another performer trying to stir up controversy and gain popularity, he's already got the latter covered. Like Soulja Boy and Justin Bieber, Lil B has almost single-handedly used the internet to put himself into the spotlight. In a few short years as a solo artist without a major-label deal, Lil B has recorded almost 4,000 songs, gained over 200,000 Twitter followers and signed a touring deal with LiveNation. His YouTube videos have been viewed 28.7 million times and counting. Lil B's supporters and fans laud him for his gender-defying self-proclamations that he's ""pretty b----"" and a ""princess"" while producing songs inspired by untraditional hip-hop topics like Miley Cyrus and Ellen DeGeneres. At the same time, a growing skepticism follows the artist, who some critics argue is full of himself and is more concerned with selling an image through hyperbolic claims than any music of substance. Lil B says he saw the Coachella moment as a chance to bridge the differences between communities and spread his message of ""loving."" ""I think that (announcement) was so much bigger than he was,"" said Terrance Dean, a former MTV executive and the openly gay author of the book ""Hiding in Hip-Hop."" ""That it was like seeing his future before it even actually happened."" While advocates in the LGBT community like Dean feel that Lil B is sincere, others like Lloyd ""Gyant"" Dinwiddie, a BET blogger of the year who is openly gay, aren't so sure. ""I don't want to take anything away from what I think he's trying to do,"" Gyant said of the album, which is set for release in a few months, according to Lil B. ""I really do feel that it is less about social evolution, and it's more about making a name for yourself and selling your project."" Lil B sat down with CNN to talk about the inspiration for the title, the death threats that have followed and why he's the rap version of Lady Gaga. The following is a transcript of that interview. CNN: What were you thinking when you named the album ""I'm Gay?"" Lil B: It was something that was going through my mind for a while. I feel like I'm man of the people: meeting people, respecting people and accepting people. I hope that I can turn some of my fans that might be homophobic or supporters that might be homophobic and say, ""You know what, we're all one people. This is love."" It's just respect, and I did that to bring people together and bring more love and to spark the minds of people and not let words and judgments and stereotypes stop you from loving. CNN: I read that you've gotten some death threats. Lil B: Mainly, a lot of them are on Twitter, saying that they're going to kill me for being gay, and they're going to kill me for being homosexual even though I'm not homosexual. I don't like men. They're saying they're going to bash my head in. They're calling me f-----. That's all right, because I did this with the pure intention in my heart to help people, and I didn't do this for promotional reasons. I did because there needs to be someone brave enough to do it, brave enough to speak up and have the right reasonings of doing it. CNN: What's your response to people who say this is all a gimmick? Lil B: I'm not here just doing stuff just trying to do it or outsmart somebody and try to do something witty. I call myself the human sacrifice, because I look at it like, no one else is going to do it and push that line for the people, and I'm going to do it, and they're going to look at me and say, ""Well, you know what? If that guy can do it, I can be myself too, and if that rapper can be himself and be free and be happy and still hold masculinity and love people and love flowers and just be happy being alive, well then, I can do that too."" CNN: You're big Twitter fan, and recently rapper Rhymefest tweeted that after he spoke to California artist Xzibit and listened to your music, his response was, ""Homeboy needed a dad in his life."" Lil B: I'm going to say, who is Rhymefest? So he needs to work on promoting and marketing himself, because I don't know him. But what I feel about his comment is that it's true, I needed a father figure in my life, but I'm not complaining about that. What do you mean, I need that? Tell Rhymefest I'm very happy. Tell Rhymefest I actually wake up and I'm happy, and I'm positive and I love people. Ask Rhymefest, does he feel the same way? CNN: How influential are your parents in your career, and what do they think about your music? Lil B: I can say they're not very influential in my career, but I'm motivated; I work hard to show my mother that her child has a purpose. My father has played a part unconsciously when I was younger, which he probably didn't know,. But he was giving me a lot of good music, (and) my mother played a lot of good music. So I will always forever show respect to both of them on that. They might not be listening to my music all the time because there's stuff that they don't agree with. I don't expect them to agree with my language and stuff like that. CNN: You've called yourself rap's Lady Gaga. Care to elaborate? Lil B: It's just because I'm fearless. I have a huge support base of people that love me around the world: millions of fans and supporters and growing. You know what, it's just me putting what I want to put out and me just being an artist, a true artist to myself. I go to sleep happy. I wake up excited because I give the truth. CNN: On Twitter, you threatened to sexually assault Kanye West if he didn't respond to your tweets. Why threaten Kanye West with sexual violence? Lil B: You know, really, it's just my jokes. I have a funny sense of humor. If I was a comedian and I was up on stage, people would think that's funny, because I'm a funny comedian. I'm an entertainer. Throughout the years I feel if God promotes me to stay alive and have more years to live on Earth, which I pray and I would love to, people are going to see my personality, and they're going to see more of me and be able to understand me more. CNN: Do you think of a lot of the hate/confusion is a generational thing? Lil B: There's a disconnect because they want a disconnect. When you want to read the book, come read the book. When you want to come talk to me and be my friend, come talk to me. They want that disconnect. They want to seclude themselves. The generation gap, they don't want to understand. CNN: What's your response to folks who say you've pushed the progression of hip-hop back a few steps? Lil B: They're just not paying attention fully, and I forgive them. Not everybody has time to pay attention fully, or not everybody has the time to read a book. Some people refuse to read books, and I'm just an unread book. Open me!","Album title has brought debate, death threats .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine's embattled government has agreed to scrap harsh laws limiting protests and give amnesty to demonstrators who seized the Justice Ministry headquarters, a top official announced late Monday. With Ukraine's political crisis deepening, protesters left the ministry after Justice Minister Olena Lukash warned that she would call for a state of emergency. But at the end of the day, Lukash said the anti-protest laws that went into effect on January 16 would be repealed and the protesters who occupied her ministry would receive amnesty -- as long as they cleared out of ""all seized premises and roads."" The statement came after another round of talks between the government of President Viktor Yanukovych and an opposition whose followers have massed in and around central Kiev's Maidan Square to demand Yanukovych's ouster and new elections. Police and protesters have fought pitched battles in the streets, leaving scores injured and several dead. Anti-government demonstrators seized the Justice Ministry building on Sunday night. They cleared out Monday after Lukash threatened to impose a state of emergency -- a step opposition spokeswoman Lesya Orobets warned could lead to the use of military units to suppress protests. ""We as an opposition spent the whole day trying to negotiate with people who actually captured the premises to get out of there, not to give them any legal base for a state of emergency,"" Orobets told CNN's Amanpour program. Oleksandr Danylyuk, the leader of one of the protest factions, said the groups retreated to avert difficulties in negotiations between the government and opposition. But while the protesters left the ministry, they remained outside, where a sign and front window were smashed, creating a blockade. They jumped up and down, thumping sticks on the ground and shouting, ""Bandits out."" The violence that has rattled Kiev for weeks spread outside the capital Sunday, with reports of protesters seizing municipal headquarters in other towns. Ukraine's parliament was expected to hold a special session on the protests Tuesday, and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, was headed for Kiev in a bid to help defuse the standoff. Ashton urged the government not to impose a state of emergency, saying the move ""would trigger a further downward spiral for Ukraine, which would benefit no one."" ""What is urgently needed is a genuine dialogue to build a new consensus on the way forward,"" Ashton said in a written statement late Monday. ""I hope that the Ukrainian parliament will set a clear path during tomorrow's session towards a political solution. This must include revoking the package of laws passed on 16 January."" And U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Yanukovych on Monday night to reiterate American support for ""a peaceful, political solution to the crisis,"" the White House said. ""Underscoring that no time should be lost, the vice president urged President Yanukovych to pull back riot police and work with the opposition on immediate measures to de-escalate tensions between protesters and the government,"" a White House readout of the call stated. ""He also urged the government to take concrete steps during tomorrow's parliamentary session to respond to the full and legitimate concerns of the Ukrainian people, including by repealing the anti-democratic laws passed on January 16."" Ukraine opposition rejects president's offer; protestor mourned . Government offer rejected . Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, is home to 45 million people. The clashes there are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead. Among the snowy rooftops of Kiev, smoke can often be seen billowing from the city center, where thousands of demonstrators have massed despite freezing weather, setting up makeshift barricades and bombarding police with gasoline bombs. Scenes of fires, burnt tires, smashed windows and the drumbeats of sticks on corrugated metal have become familiar occurrences on the city's central arteries. More recently, protesters, old and young, have been voicing their anger about anti-protest laws passed this month. The controversial new laws have sparked concerns that they could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech. They're also calling for changes to the country's constitution. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, imprisoned since 2010 on charges the United States and Europe have called politically motivated, called on the opposition to remain firm in a statement Monday evening. ""The people of Ukraine went out onto the Maidan not for the opposition leaders to be given government posts, and not even for revoking of the dictatorial laws,"" Tymoshenko said. ""The people want fundamental changes in their lives, justice in Ukraine and a path to European values. This is their last chance."" Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk has refused Yanukovich's offer to be prime minister, Lukash said Monday night. Yatsenyuk, who heads the Fatherland Party, would have become the prime minister and would have been able to dismiss the current government, which has been one of the protesters' demands. Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, the former heavyweight boxing champion, said Sunday that he had rejected the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues. His announcement was greeted by loud cheers from the crowd -- but his Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party, or UDAR, said it was ready to continue negotiations with the government. Yanukovych also said he would agree to a working group to look at changes to the constitution, according to the President's website. Read more: Is Ukraine becoming a dictatorship?

"(CNN) -- Fabrice Muamba has taken to the football pitch for the first time since his dramatic on field collapse, he told CNN Thursday. Muamba was playing for English Premier League team Bolton when he suffered a cardiac arrest during an FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on March 17. Television viewers and the players looked on in horror as medical staff battled to revive the 24-year-old midfielder. He was taken to the London Chest Hospital and it was later revealed his heart had stopped beating for 78 minutes. Muamba spent a month in hospital but has since made a remarkable recovery. He was continuing his recuperation in Dubai in May with his fiancee Shauna Magunda when he took the spur of the moment decision to join in a game between staff at his hotel and other guests. ""I am sorry but I am going to play football,"" he told her. ""It was just like I was training. It was great, I enjoyed it."" Muamba said the game lasted about half an hour, but told CNN that he has never tweeted the photos of him playing. Muamba is taking specialist medical advice ahead of what he hopes to be a return to the rigors of the professional game. ""I just hope to God that I can get in there myself, with 11 players on the pitch and to play would be fantastic,"" he added. Muamba made an emotional return to watch an English Premier League match at Bolton's Reebok Stadium against Tottenham on May 3. He was given a standing ovation as he waved to fans in the center of the pitch. Muamba, who was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has played for the England under-21 team as well as making 167 appearances for Birmingham and Bolton in the EPL.","Fabrice Muamba has played football for first time since his cardiac arrest .

"(CNN) -- The latest annual U.N. climate change summit begins Monday in Warsaw. The talks will see some 200 nations try to make progress toward securing an important new comprehensive global treaty in advance of a 2015 deadline. The summit, which is unlikely to bring a truly decisive breakthrough, will generate massive international attention -- but the reality is that the new frontline in the battle against global warming is at the national rather than global level. This fundamental shift in the center of gravity of the climate change debate is one that few have yet to recognize. Yet it has game-changing implications, not least for how best to secure a comprehensive global deal by 2015. In stark contrast to the snail's pace of progress in U.N. talks, domestic and sub-national laws and regulations to address climate change are being passed at an increasing rate. In 2012 alone, 32 of 33 surveyed countries (which account for more than 85% of global greenhouse gas emissions), including the United States and China, have introduced significant climate or energy-related legislation and regulation, according to a recent GLOBE International report. This shift is a key part of a wider transformation taking place. Previously, much of the political debate on global warming has been framed around narratives of sharing a global burden -- with governments often trying to minimise their share. Now, many legislators view the issue as one of national self-interest, and growing numbers of nations are trying to maximize the benefits of climate change measures. In recent years, countries across the world, from Mexico to the UK to South Korea, have passed comprehensive measures. The GLOBE study shows that developing states have been especially likely in recent years to conclude it is in their national interest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by embracing low-carbon growth and development, and to better prepare for the impact of global warming. They see that expanding domestic sources of renewable energy not only reduces emissions but also increases energy security by reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. Reducing energy demand through greater efficiency reduces costs and increases competitiveness. Improving resilience to the impacts of climate change also makes sound economic sense. Far from undermining the U.N. talks process, this bottom-up approach could be the decisive development which helps secure a new comprehensive global deal by 2015. Advancing domestic measures on climate change and experiencing the benefits of reducing emissions are crucial building blocks that may help create the political conditions to enable an agreement to be reached. As game-changing as these national developments are, they are as yet insufficient to avoid warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius in coming decades, compared to pre-industrial levels -- the amount most experts agree is needed to avoid ""runaway"" climate change. Nonetheless, the national legal and policy frameworks to measure, report, verify and manage carbon that are now being created could potentially be ratcheted up, especially as governments experience the benefits of lower energy use, reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and greater energy security. As this happens, the goal must be to translate such progress into a comprehensive, global deal. It remains in the balance at this stage whether such a broad-ranging agreement, with the necessary ambition, will be reached by 2015 unless more domestic frameworks are in place in key countries. Sound domestic actions enhance the prospects of international action, and better international prospects enhance domestic actions. Given this uncertain outlook, and as difficult negotiations in Poland approach, a key danger is that some countries might lower their long-term ambitions and perhaps even harden their stances in dealing with others. This would be ill-timed. Indeed, with 2015 approaching now is the time for countries to invest even more in climate diplomacy and practical fast international cooperation. In so doing, they will help expedite conditions on the ground that could make the difference between a comprehensive global treaty being reached, or not, in the next 24 months.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of residents of an area contaminated by a catastrophic reactor meltdown at a nuclear plant in northeastern Japan have been allowed to return home three years after the disaster. An evacuation order, declared in the aftermath of a devastating tsunami that crippled the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant in March, 2011, was lifted at midnight on Monday from the Miyakoji district of Tamura city in Fukushima Prefecture. Residents of the town, who have been in limbo ever since, are now free to re-inhabit their homes following decontamination work in the area. The Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami off Japan's northeastern coast led to the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Three reactors melted down, with the resulting radiation fallout forcing nearly 140,000 people from their homes. Around 138,000 Fukushima residents remain in temporary accommodation, with a number of cities, towns and villages reduced to ghost towns due to continued high levels of radiation. ""We are doing as much as possible (to allow) the other residents can come home. We are strengthening support towards the residents (and) strengthening the decommissioning work,"" a TEPCO spokesperson told CNN. Restrictions lifted . Monday's lifting of the exclusion order is the first time an area this close to the site has been cleared. Miyakoji is 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the plant, on the edge of the initial exclusion zone. Prior to the lifting of the order, some Fukushima residents were allowed to stay overnight in their homes, subject to registration. All restrictions on their movements have now been lifted within the cleared district. 355 residents -- out of a total 116 households -- are now free to return to their homes in Miyakoji permanently. The city of Tamura is one of eleven settlements in Fukushima that are still subject to evacuation orders. Radiation worries . However, concerns remain about background radiation levels and uncertainty surrounding the safety of the area, especially given past concerns about the reporting of radiation levels in the area by Fukushima's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Last month, Miyakoji residents were told at a community meeting that radiation contamination levels had lowered sufficiently to enable their return to the area -- though some voiced concern over existing radiation levels despite decontamination efforts around some communities. ""Yes, I am a bit worried. But it's my land, my house, so I am feel safer and more at home here,"" one resident told broadcaster NHK. Areas are declared suitable for habitation if residents are exposed to a maximum of 20 millisieverts of radiation per year. Officials have said they would like to get radiation exposure down to one millisievert a year. The containment effort at the wrecked Fukushima plant has been beset by problems, with regular reports of leaks of contaminated material. Earlier this year, an estimated 100 metric tons of highly contaminated water flowed over a barrier around a containment tank and is being absorbed into the ground, TEPCO said in a statement -- though it denied there was any leakage into the nearby Pacific Ocean.

"(CNN) -- The United States is urging Turkey to show restraint after Kurdish rebels attacked its forces on Sunday, killing at least 17 Turkish soldiers and wounding 16 others near Turkey's border with Iraq and Iran, according to Turkey's defense minister. A Turkish soldier walks through the village of Senoba, Turkey, near the border with Iraq. The initial response by Turkish forces was to hit back by killing 32 rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in southern Turkey, according to a statement on an official government Web site. Sunday's deadly attack on Turkish soldiers prompted outrage among citizens in Istanbul, Turkey, who took to the streets in protest. Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul said that, in addition to the 17 killed, 10 Turkish soldiers were missing after the ambush in southern Turkey. He denied reports they had been abducted by PKK rebels. Shortly after the attack, a wedding convoy tripped a landmine in Daglica, Turkey, near the ambush site, a Turkish government source said. The attack wounded 12 people and is believed to have been the work of PKK rebels, the source said.  Watch CNN's Nic Robertson report on the attack » . After an emergency meeting Sunday of Turkey's military and political leaders President Abdullah Gul issued a statement saying: ""We will continue on our path of determination in fighting the terrorist organization. We respect Iraq's national borders. But [we] will not tolerate those who help and harbor terrorists."" There are fears that the escalation in fighting could spill into northern Iraq's Kurdish region, where Turkey insists the PKK leadership is based. But Iraq denies that, saying PKK leaders are hiding out in rugged mountain areas along the Turkish border that are not controlled by Iraq. Cross-border shelling between Turkish forces and PKK rebels in northern Iraq continued Sunday. Iraqi leaders fear Turkish ground forces could make a major push into northern Iraq after Turkey's parliament approved such an incursion in an overwhelming vote last week. Gonul on Sunday assured U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates that Ankara would not to carry out an imminent ground incursion, but he did not abandon the possibility of sending Turkish troops into northern Iraq, which Gonul called ""a safe haven"" for PKK rebels. Gonul and Gates met in Kiev, Ukraine. Gates said: ""A major cross-border operation would be contrary to Turkey's interests as well as to our own and that of Iraq."" Iraq's President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, addressed the rising tensions with Turkey during a meeting with Kurdish regional leader Massoud Barzani in Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region. Talabani reiterated Iraq's demand that PKK rebels lay down their arms, and restated calls for a diplomatic solution. He also said Sunday that Iraqi forces are unable to find the rebel leaders because of the difficult landscape. ""The Turkish military, with its mightiness, could not annihilate them or arrest them, so how could we arrest them and hand them to Turkey?"" Talabani said at a news conference following his meeting with Barzani. Turkey's parliament last week passed a measure that enables its military to launch an incursion into northern Iraq and chase down Kurdish rebels. Although Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the vote in his parliament last week wouldn't necessarily trigger immediate military action against the PKK, the United States and Iraqi officials have been in high diplomatic gear for days in efforts to keep Turkey from carrying out the proposed cross-border assaults against the rebels. The United States fears a large-scale military operation by Turkey in northern Iraq would undermine the stability of the U.S.-backed government in Baghdad and jeopardize supply lines that support U.S. troops in Iraq. Tariq al-Hashimi, one of Iraq's two vice presidents and a top Sunni Arab leader, met with Turkish leaders last week about the tensions along the Iraq-Turkish border, and said the talks ""ended in good results,"" his office said in a statement. Iraq's Kurdish region -- which consists of Duhuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya provinces -- has had a close economic relationship with Turkey, and the passage of the Turkish measure has stoked anger there. When asked how Iraq's government would respond to the possibility of Turkish ground forces in northern Iraq, Barzani urged dialogue with Turkey but said Iraqi forces would act ""in self-defense."" ""We will not be a part of any such conflict,"" Barzani said. ""But if we are targeted directly we will defend ourselves."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A week after students seized Taiwan's legislative building over a controversial trade deal with China, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou agreed to meet with protest leaders to help end the standoff and allow the legislature to get back on track, a spokesperson for the president's office said. Ma is willing to invite representatives of the movement to his office ""without any preconditions,"" Li Jia-fei, a spokesperson for the president's office said Tuesday in a statement. Hundreds of protesters, many of them university students, have been camped out in the Legislative Yuan's main assembly hall since March 18, over a service trade pact that they say could harm Taiwan's economy and allow China to exert greater influence over the island. Thousands more have gathered outside the building, according to organizers. At a press conference on Tuesday night, student leader Lin Fei-fan responded to the president's invitation, saying the protesters agreed that no preconditions should be set for the meeting. But, he added, the students wanted to discuss whether Taiwan needed new legislation to monitor all cross-strait agreements, and whether the service trade pact with China should be delayed until that legislation is introduced. On Wednesday, Lin said the students were rejecting the president's invitation for now as it failed to include a fixed date or time for the talks, or concrete content for discussion. He told CNN that the protesters inside the Legislative Yuan had no plans to leave. ""We are willing to talk, but we really hope to see the president express sincerity,"" Lin said in a statement on his Facebook page. The president's office confirmed to CNN that the students had not yet accepted the invitation. Taiwan signed the service trade pact with China, its biggest trade partner in June last year, but it is yet to be ratified. The agreement will open up 80 of China's service sectors to Taiwan and 64 of Taiwan's service sectors to China, including tourism, transport, construction and telecommunications. A review of the deal was delayed in Taiwan's legislature until March 17, when Taiwan's ruling party Kuomintang pushed the pact forward without bipartisan deliberation. The main opposition said that this move broke an agreement that all legislators would consider the deal one clause at a time. Protesters, who claimed negotiations over the deal were opaque and undemocratic, broke into the legislative building in Taipei the next day, demanding that the pact be scrapped. The demonstration has been mostly peaceful, but tensions boiled over late Sunday, when a group of protesters stormed the nearby executive building. More than 100 people were injured when riot police armed with wooden batons and shields evicted the protesters and dispersed the crowd using water cannon. Hours before the scuffle, Taiwan's president defended the deal in his first public address to the protests. Calling on the protesters to adhere to the rule of law, Ma said the pact would create jobs for young people and that without regional economic integration, Taiwan would be left behind. Student leader Lin Fei-fan,speaking to CNN by phone from inside the legislature building Monday, criticized the pact. He claimed the deal would allow China to invest in ""sensitive and core industries"" including those associated with press freedom, such as publishing and advertising. Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949 following the Chinese Civil War, but Beijing still considers it a breakaway province, and has warned that any formal declaration of independence could lead to military intervention. However, cross-strait ties have improved since Ma took office in 2008, and recent high-level talks between the two sides have been hailed as a sign of thawing relations. On Monday, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, Marie Harf told reporters that the United States has welcomed steps by Taiwan and China to reduce tensions and improve relations, and hopes that talks over the trade deal can be conducted ""peacefully and civilly."" ""We certainly support Taiwan's vibrant democracy, which allows for this kind of robust political dialogue,"" Harf said. The protests have garnered widespread support among Taiwanese living abroad. Rallies are being held in at least 10 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.

"(CNN) -- The North Korean cargo ship seized last July by Panamanian authorities for carrying an illegal arms shipment departed Panamanian waters Saturday, Panama's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The North Korean-flagged vessel Chong Chon Gang headed toward Cuba after the International Red Cross determined the 32 sailors aboard were fit to travel, the ministry said. The ship's captain, first officer and political secretary remain in Panama to face weapons smuggling charges, the ministry said. Panama stopped the ship in July, and authorities said they found undeclared weaponry from Cuba -- including MiG fighter jets, anti-aircraft systems and explosives -- buried under thousands of bags of sugar. The Cuban government said the shipment consisted of ""obsolete"" weapons being sent to North Korea for repairs before they were to be returned to Cuba. But Panama said it violated United Nations arms sanctions on North Korea. Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons. North Korea paid a fine of nearly $700,000 for violating regulations for navigation in canal waters, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Journalist Castalia Pascual and CNN's Kevin Wang and Jethro Mullen contributed to this story .","Three ship officers must remain to face weapons smuggling charges .

"(CNN) -- In the playgrounds across Dortmund they will be re-enacting this night for years to come. Each child will take it in turns to take on the role of Felipe Santana, another will pretend to follow in the footsteps of Marco Reus, while others will fight it out to pull on the imaginary shirt of Robert Lewandowski. It is nights like these which inspire not only those inside the stadium, but the next generation of footballers. It's what makes the intangible, tangible. Trailing 2-1 to Malaga going into stoppage time in Tuesday's Champions League quarterfinal second leg, the Dortmund dream lay in tatters. This youthful and vibrant side, a team which has won admirers from across the globe, appeared to have choked when it was supposed to underline its status as one of the most exciting sides in Europe. But this is football -- a sport which still boasts the capacity to leave even the most seasoned of spectators transfixed in a state of disbelief. With the clock ticking down and all hope abating, Dortmund produced one of the most astonishing European comebacks in recent years. Two goals in added time broke Spanish hearts and propelled Jurgen Klopp's side into the semifinals in a manner befitting of its own film script. This was Hollywood. The German side, which had held Malaga to a goalless draw in the first leg, was expected to reach the semifinal with ease and qualify for the last four for the first time since 1998. It was not difficult to see why Dortmund was considered such a strong favourite -- it plays a brand of football which reawakens the youthful spirit in even the most weary of souls. In its yellow and black shirts, the players buzz and swarm around like bees, pushing, pressing and pestering. But while Dortmund dominated, it failed to make that crucial incision. Instead, it was Malaga which made the first move, giving the game a twist most did not expect to witness. Joaquin's fierce strike found the corner and temporarily silenced the raucous crowd packed inside the stadium. But that goal, which arrived after 25 minutes, only served to stir Dortmund into action. Suddenly Dortmund found its spark -- and what a spark. In the end it was a moment of magic which lit up the Dortmund sky as the home side drew level with a sublime demonstration of how to unlock a defense. This was not simply a ""goal"". No, this was a thing of sheer beauty from the moment the ball found its way to Marco Reus until it hit the back of the net; this was football from a different planet. Reus, the precociously talented playmaker, unfurled a flick of such cunning that it split the Malaga defense and allowed Robert Lewandowski to clip the ball over the goalkeeper and fire home. It was beautiful. If Barcelona had scored a goal of similar fashion then the world would have stopped and applauded -- Dortmund are not there yet, but this team is showing a potential which should excite those who embrace such pure football. But while its attacking prowess was clear to see, the backdoor always appeared ajar for a Malaga side determined to make light of its financial troubles and secure a last four berth. Joaquin twice failed to scored with headers when well placed, but those misses appeared not to matter when Eliseu touched home Julio Baptista's shot with eight minutes remaining. That goal, which was converted from an offside position, left the home supporters crushed. But Dortmund refused to be denied and with the game drifting into the 91st minute, Reus lashed home from close range to level the game at 2-2 and leave his side needing one more goal. With just a couple of minutes left to play, Malaga needed only to hold out and preserve the 2-2 scoreline to progress. But as the yellow and black shirts poured forward, the Malaga defense buckled. From a seemingly hopeless position, the ball was lumped into the penalty area before falling at the feet of Santana just a yard from goal. He was offside -- earlier in the move there were four Dortmund players offside -- but that didn't stop him. The Brazilian smashed the ball home, the assistant referee's flag didn't go up, the referee didn't blow. The goal stood as Malaga fell. Dortmund had triumphed. ""There is one very disappointed team in this moment and one lucky team,"" Klopp told Sky Sports. ""It's unbelievable. It was our worst game in the Champions League this season and not our best football. ""If we play like tonight we won't win the Champions League, but we have reached our target of the semifinal."" Malaga, which was making its debut in the competition, was left shell shocked as it suffered a heartbreaking exit. ""We were four minutes away from the semis,"" striker Roque Santa Cruz told Sky Sports. ""There is huge disappointment in the dressing room. We had the tie in our hands."" In the night's other game, Real Madrid progressed to the final four, despite suffering a 3-2 defeat in Turkey against Galatasaray. Leading 3-0 from the first leg, Cristiano Ronaldo's early strike appeared to kill off any hope the home side might have had of causing an upset. But Fatih Terim's men produced an inspired performance with goals from Emmanuel Eboue, Wesley Sneijder and Didier Drogba firing it into a 3-1 lead on the night. Ronaldo grabbed a late second, his 48th goal in 47 games this season, to finally end the fightback. Real finished with 10-men after Alvaro Arbeloa was sent off. ""I wasn't getting nervous because I have no time for it,"" Real boss Jose Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""I am on the bench so I have no time to think or to feel it, they are strong, strong mentally. ""They don't play against 11, they play 50,000 against 11 and it was hard for us. ""We are there, in the semifinals and that is what that matters. ""Today is the kind of match where you have everything to lose and nothing to win. ""People think we are already in the semifinal and players that that feeling from the outside. I felt the team was ready to work hard and had the motivation to reach Wembley in the final. ""I don't know who we will play in the semifinal, it will be against a great team, that's for sure and we need to play the semifinal and enjoy it.""","Borussia Dortmund scored twice in stoppage time to secure a 3-2 win over Malaga .

"(CNN) -- Police in Northern California have arrested an elementary schoolteacher after she allegedly brought marijuana-laced food to an after-hours employee potluck dinner. Teresa Gilmete Badger, a 47-year-old teacher at Matthew Turner Elementary School in Benicia, was arrested Friday afternoon on suspicion of poisoning after a six-week-long investigation, said Lt. Frank Hartig of the Benicia Police Department. After the late-November get-together in the Bay Area town, several people reported feeling ill, a police statement said. ""One of the partygoers was rushed to the hospital with severe reactions; she was hospitalized,"" Hartig told CNN affiliate KPIX. ""The very next morning, another partygoer was taken to the hospital, because she continued to feel like she was under the influence of something."" At least one of the women tested positive for THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol), the principal intoxicant in marijuana, police said. A 15-year-old also got sick after someone at the party brought leftovers home, according to police. During their investigation, police said they were told that Badger had ""allegedly confessed her involvement to individuals who were also in attendance at the party.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan state television has aired a video of Moammar Gadhafi's son Saadi in which he apologized to the nation from prison. ""I apologize to the people of Libya and the brothers in the Libyan state for the disturbance and destabilization I have caused in Libya, and I admit those were wrong things that I should not have done,"" he said. Saadi, one of Gadahfi's seven sons, has been in a Tripoli jail since his extradition earlier this month from neighboring Niger. The North African country had been seeking the handover of Saadi, who fled across the border to Niger when rebel forces toppled his father in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011. He has not appeared in court yet and no formal charges against him have been announced, but the government has said it has evidence linking Saadi Gadhafi to recent unrest in southern Libya. ""I call on all the people carrying weapons to disarm, weapons should only be in the hands of the state,"" Saadi Gadhafi, dressed in a blue detainee suit, said in the video. ""They should resort to reconciliation."" In the three-minute video clip, he also asks the Libyan government and general national congress, Libya's legislative body, for ""forgiveness."" The conditions surrounding the release of the video are unclear. Reports of abuse . Saadi Gadhafi stated the date of March 27 in the video, and state television said it was approved by Libya's general prosecutor and aimed to discredit reports and rumors Gadhafi's son was being mistreated in prison. The video aired a day after former Prime Minister Ali Zeidan had said in an interview in The Times of London newspaper that he had heard Saadi Gadhafi was abused and tortured in prison. Saadi Gadhafi said he was being treated well. Reports he had broken ribs or bones were not true, he said, moving his arms around and smiling. No one has independently had access to him to see how he has been treated. There have been concerns about the legality of the video and what impact it may have on the case. ""If I ever had any hope that there might be some form of due process in Libya, it was shattered. ... Watching Saadi repent in a videotaped confession without any hint of legal representation made me realize there is no hope for a trial in accordance with international law in Libya,"" Jacqueline Frazier, an American former aide to Saadi Gadhafi, told CNN. ""I, along with his family, would like to emphasize that we believe this confession to be coerced and therefore nonadmissible in a court of law."" But many Libyans have little sympathy for him and other former regime members in custody. They complain the prosecution of former regime members has stalled and they want them to see them sentenced soon. The government has promised fair and transparent trials for all former regime members and other detainees in Libya. Televised call . Saadi Gadhafi was a professional soccer player and businessman before his father's downfall. Unlike his brother Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, their father's heir apparent, he is not wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, on charges of war crimes. In late 2011, rebel forces captured Saif al-Islam, who remains in a militia hands in the small western mountain town of Zintan, Libya. Niger handed over Saadi Gadhafi after Libyan authorities said they had provided evidence of ""communications and practices targeting Libya's security and aimed at destabilizing Libya."" In February 2012, he made a televised phone call warning of an imminent uprising in Libya, saying he was in regular contact with people in the country who were unhappy with the new authorities. Authorities in Niger had warned him after that incident. He had been staying under tight regulation, including house arrest. He is being held in al-Hadba prison in Tripoli, the same facility where other senior regime members are detained, including former Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and former spy chief and Gadhafi's brother-in-law Abdullah al-Senussi. Judicial standards . Libya's new rulers are keen to try Gaddafi loyalists at home to show that those who helped the dictator stay in power for 42 years are being punished. But in a country where thousands of war prisoners remain in detention without knowing their fate, and where allegations of torture by the militias guarding them have surfaced, Libyan authorities will have to prove their capabilities. Human rights activists say the worry that a weak Tripoli government and flimsy judicial standards mean that legal proceedings will not meet international standards. Last month, Human Rights Watch released a report after visiting and speaking with senior regime members, including al-Senussi and Saif al-Islam Gadhafi. According to the rights group, officials said they either do not have lawyers representing them or they do not have enough access to their legal counsel. ""The Libyan government should make greater efforts to ensure these detained former officials have adequate legal counsel and the opportunity to defend themselves fairly before a judge,"" said Nadim Houry, deputy director of Human Right Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. ""The prosecution of these men will be no more credible than a kangaroo court if the authorities fail to provide these men with basic due process rights."" In a briefing to the U.N. Security Council earlier this month, Tarek Mitri, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general, raised concerns about continued human rights violations in detention. Some trials of former regime members started more than a year ago, and another case against more than 30 officials, including Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and al-Senussi, is set to start next month.

They may be the biggest boyband in the world, but Britain's Daily Mirror says that won't help One Direction's plans to tour North Korea -- unless, that is, Harry Styles and co. are willing to swap their super-styled locks for Kim Jong-un's short-back-and-sides hairdo. The paper says that with the band unlikely to meet his demands, Kim is launching an ""X Factor""-style search for the North Korean equivalent, ""Un Direction."" Financial woes aren't normally a joking matter, but the UK's Sun newspaper reports that the Queen has found a novel solution to boost the monarchy's income: fracking in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Other British papers see the upcoming vote on Scottish independence as ripe for giggles, with the Guardian revealing that, should Scots back a break with the rest of the United Kingdom later this year, the nation plans to show its solidarity with mainland Europe by switching to driving on the right. The paper says a newly-independent Scotland would scrap its current road signs, ditching ""the famous road sign font known as 'Transport' with a new Celtic-tinged typeface, 'Proclaimer'."" And street signs aren't the only thing set to be dumped: The Daily Telegraph reports that, should his campaign succeed, pro-independence leader Alex Salmond will replace the Queen on Scottish coins, with the currency to be known as the ""Salmond Sterling."" The Independent, meanwhile, announces that the U.N. is drawing up plans to send in peacekeepers in the event of post-independence tensions between Scotland and England. Quoting unnamed sources, the paper says the U.N. is concerned a ""Yes"" vote could result in ""pre-arranged 'face-offs,' modelled on the film 'Braveheart,' between rival militias who it is feared could travel to towns such as Gretna Green and Berwick-upon-Tweed for weekend showdowns."" The Daily Mail reports that those south of the border are also making plans for life after a split, with ""secret government papers"" revealing just what the Union Jack would look like without the blue and white Scottish flag, known as the saltire. In Australia, there is news that Hollywood bigwigs had found inspiration for the latest big-screen biopic down under, with former Prime Minister John Howard set to be immortalized on film.

"(CNN) -- Iraqi security forces on Thursday thwarted an attack by an al Qaeda splinter group on a military base in central Iraq, killing 40 gunmen, Iraq's Interior Ministry said. One Iraqi army officer was killed in the attack by members of the group calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, according to the ministry. The attack happened at a base in Yusufiya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the country's capital, Baghdad. Also Thursday, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in northern Iraq, killing at least four people and injuring 13 others, police officials in Tikrit and Kirkuk said. The restaurant was in Tuz Khurmatou, about 200 kilometers north of Baghdad. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed. In March alone, terrorist attacks and other violence killed 592 people and injured 1,234 others in Iraq, excluding Anbar province, according to the United Nations . The United Nations in March kept separate, civilian-only figures for Anbar, which has seen intense fighting between Sunni extremists and Iraqi security forces since the beginning of this year. More than 480 civilians, including 133 civilian police officers, were killed, and 1,104 civilians were injured last month in Anbar, the United Nations said. In February, more than 700 people were killed and nearly 1,400 others were wounded in Iraq, according to the United Nations.","Iraq: Al Qaeda splinter group attacked military base south of Baghdad .

"HOUSTON, Texas -- Six-year-old Valentin Marroquin went from being apparently healthy one moment to battling leukemia the next. As his mother Rosario Marroquin started searching for answers, she kept coming back to their Houston, Texas, neighborhood, and the stench that often envelops it. Valentin Marroquin of Houston, Texas, was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of six. ""We're the stinky neighborhood,"" she said. ""But we've gotten so used to it that we don't know that's just how we smell."" The Marroquin family lives in the Manchester area of Houston, next to the Houston ship channel, the largest petrochemical complex in the United States. Day after day, oil refineries and petrochemical companies pump hazardous pollutants, including known cancer-causing chemicals like benzene and 1-3 butadiene, into the air. ""I'm not ignorant,"" Rosario told CNN. ""Kids get sick in the country in the fresh air, but this had something to do with it.""  See the source of the smell they fear » . No one can say for certain that Valentin's illness was caused by the air he breathed, but earlier this year, the University of Texas released a study showing that children who live within two miles of the ship channel have a 56 percent greater chance of getting leukemia than kids living elsewhere. It's the first study showing an association between the channel's air quality and childhood leukemia. The health risks from the shipping canal are not limited to cancer. The chemicals in the air can cause other serious health problems, such as respiratory diseases and birth defects. Tom McGarity, a professor of environmental law at the University of Texas, believes such conditions are allowed to persist because 90 percent of the people who call the ship channel home are Hispanic and many of them are poor. ""If these plants were omitting these kinds of levels in River Oaks, it wouldn't be happening, I promise,"" he said. River Oaks is one of the more affluent communities in Houston. The connection between poverty and poor environmental conditions is not limited to Texas. In many of the countries visited for CNN's ""Planet in Peril"" documentary, such as Cambodia, Thailand, Madagascar, Chad, China and Brazil, it is the poor and disenfranchised who bear the brunt of environmental burdens. A similar dynamic plays out in the United States, where class and very often race can determine where one lives. In 2005, for example, The Associated Press reported blacks were 79 percent more likely than whites to live in neighborhoods where industrial pollution was suspected of posing the greatest health danger. ""It's really mind-boggling that we could kind of write off, you know, a whole section of our society,"" said Majora Carter, founder of the Sustainable South Bronx, which fights what Carter calls ""environmental racism"" in New York and around the country. ""No one should have to bear the brunt of environmental burdens and not enjoy any environmental benefits, and right now race and class ... really determine the good things like parks and trees or the bad stuff like waste facilities and power plants,"" she said. Michael Honeycutt, chief toxicologist for the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality, says progress has been made in reducing toxins around the Houston Ship Channel. There is ""one third less pollution in the Houston Ship Channel this year, compared to last year, because of our approach of bringing companies in, telling them what we want,"" Honeycutt said. ""And we're seeing those reductions."" ""Our job is to protect human health and the environment,"" he said. ""What's happened is it's issues of timing -- what's a safe level, what's not a safe level."" Honeycut said scientists are generating new data all the time and that certain emissions or areas formerly thought to be safe may no longer appear to be. Houston Mayor Bill White has pledged to reduce the level of air toxins for communities along the ship channel. ""We will have both the political and legal battle with the industry until we get widespread agreement to do so,"" White said. A Rice University study released in 2006 showed that Houston has a higher concentration of benzene and 1-3 butadiene than anywhere else in the United States. The annual average of 1-3 butadiene, a carcinogen, was at least 20 times higher than any other city in America. Companies in the ship channel told CNN they've started voluntarily limiting their emissions. They also point out that they haven't broken any laws.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- India Barnes charged a makeshift goal during Friday's soccer practice. The 9-year-old's blue and white uniform flapped at her back as she dodged past her teammates through a patch of dirt. She tried to score and was stopped short by a defender, before hustling downfield to try again. Following in the footsteps of her older brother, Barnes started playing soccer when she was 4 years old, for Coach Walter Stewart. ""I want to grow up and be a professional soccer player,"" Barnes gushed. Barnes and her teammates got together Sunday to watch the women's World Cup finals with their coaches, who doled out pointers to their players over boxes of pizza. Gallery:  Women's World Cup final . Huddled on an oversized couch, the girls cheered on the U.S. team -- covering their faces during the infamous penalty kick phase. Stewart started coaching the all-girls team in 1998 with only eight players at the Marian Anderson Recreation Center in South Philadelphia. He began first as a volunteer boys' baseball and soccer coach before launching the girls' soccer club. Stewart oversees the urban program, whose players are mostly African-Americans competing against suburban teams and elite clubs. ""I don't recruit and we're not exclusive,"" Stewart said. ""It's not like I went out and picked the girls. The program exists because the girls want to play and we happen to be in a predominately African-American neighborhood."" The Anderson Monarchs are named after two very important role models:  Marian Anderson, the great opera singer from Philadelphia, and Jackie Robinson's 1945 Negro League team, the Kansas City Monarchs. Stewart walked away from partnership at a downtown Philadelphia law firm to become a fourth-grade teacher at a Catholic elementary school and to volunteer his out-of-school hours to introducing soccer to urban youth who otherwise might not have a chance to play. ""I just think everybody should have an opportunity to play. There are girls who want to play that may not get the opportunity in many parts of the country, and they can play, and they're very good,"" he said. Although he has girls who want to play, the team plays with virtually no funding on a borrowed patch of field in urban Philadelphia that is overused, dotted with patches of dirt and at times littered with trash and even drug paraphernalia. ""There would be no team if it wasn't for Coach Walt. It really is a labor of love. He doesn't get paid and we can barely afford uniforms,"" said Jada Pennick, whose daughter, Cyndey, plays for the team. The players also face other obstacles. Many hail from neighborhoods that are rife with violence and drug use, that lack access to after-school activities. ""They deal with the challenges of inner-city living for black girls, and soccer isn't that popular socially,"" said Jafi Barnes, assistant coach. ""We deal with racism, social pressures, but it does teach them about life and brings them closer together."" The Monarchs aren't just about soccer. Grades are just as important as picking up ball-handling skills -- or more so. ""The idea is to get to college. You can't play and you can't attend a Division I school without having the grades,"" Barnes said. ""This is about a lifestyle change."" Barnes' two stepdaughters, Marquise and Kiya, play for the Monarchs. His wife, Karea, said the program changed her daughters -- who never played soccer before -- for the better. ""They're both straight-A students, they have perfect attendance, and soccer keeps them focused,"" she said. ""People should know about the hidden talent in cities across the country and reach people who have never played."" The U.S. women's soccer team may have lost to Japan, but it's still inspiring this special team of inner-city girls who play soccer on a dusty field in urban Philly. ""They just want a chance to play,"" Stewart said. ""They're no different than anybody else.""","The Anderson Monarchs girls' soccer team is part of an urban league in south Philadelphia .

"(CNN) -- Almost two years after Air France Flight 447 plunged into the southern Atlantic Ocean killing all 228 people aboard, investigators have released a report on what they believe caused the crash. After an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles, the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found on the ocean floor at the beginning of May. After analyzing the data, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) released its report Friday saying the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed because the aircraft's speed sensors gave invalid readings. When did Flight 447 go down? Flight 447 -- which was en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro -- made its last contact with Brazil's Atlantic Control Center (ACC) at around 01:33 GMT on June 1, 2009, informing the center of the plane's position as it crossed the Atlantic. Investigators: Jet crash data recovered . Soon after, Brazil's air control contacted Dakar's control center in North Africa and reported that AF 447 was entering an area on its route known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. There was no further contact with the plane. Why has it taken so long to find the wreckage? The area where the Airbus A330 went down is in the mid-Atlantic -- two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters (about 9,840 feet) to 7,500 meters (24,600 feet). Brazilian officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters (6,562 to 9,842 feet). The latest search covered a 46-mile (75-kilometer) radius around the last known position of Flight 447, investigators said. According to the BEA the underwater terrain in this area is rough with underwater mountains and valleys. ""It is a mountain range as big as the Alps,"" David Learmount of Flight International told CNN before the release of Friday's report. ""There was always the possibility that the wreckage from the aircraft disappeared down a crevasse. This is not a flat-bottom environment like the North Sea is."" ""Therefore it is an unprecedented search in terms of depth and sub-sea terrain."" What would happen to wreckage at these depths? Up until recently, the memory module of the aircraft's data recorder -- a vital device for crash investigators which records any instructions sent to the aircraft's electronic systems -- had been missing. As a result, some experts feared it would not work even if recovered. ""Pressure and corrosion have likely damaged the wreckage, especially as it has been down there for so long,"" said Learmount. ""Flight recorders are not designed to withstand pressures of the depths that this aircraft actually went to."" But he warned that flight recorders recovered from other crash sites have not worked when they should have, with the reverse also true. Do we know why Flight 447 crashed? The BEA report findings say the airplane climbed to 38,000 ft when ""the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled."" It then descended, crashing into the Atlantic. The descent lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds and the engines remained operational, said the report. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found soon after the crash led the BEA to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA said in a 2009 report. Tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed. Before it crashed, Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said. The European Aviation Safety Agency issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich. The lack of speed, wind or direction information also prevented the Autopilot system from functioning, said air accident investigator Alain Bouillard said at the time of the crash. ""This tells us that the plane has to be, in this case, directed by the pilot,"" he said. What about the weather? Flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), when it went down. The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet. Here, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph. The height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ. However Learmount pointed out that hundreds of airliners pass through the ITCZ every day without incident. ""There was another Air France flight 30 minutes behind Flight 447 that night and it encountered no problems,"" he said. Any other theories? According to Learmount, many aviation experts have yet to rule out the human factor. ""The crash happened at around 2 am on a dark night when the error messages suddenly appeared and the autopilot tripped out."" He said the crew, possibly at their deepest circadian low at this point, suddenly have this problem and they ""fixate"" on it. ""This is a syndrome,"" he said. ""There have been lots of accidents where pilots have fixated on correcting a relatively minor problem and lose sight of the macro problem. Now we don't know that, but we do know the aircraft acted as if it was not being controlled purposefully. ""Whether it was out of control -- and I doubt this -- it was not being controlled. Imagine it is 2 am and two sleepy pilots encounter a problem. They don't have much to do so they decide to troubleshoot this problem. They fixate on it and forget the autopilot has tripped. ""The airplane meanwhile goes into a lazy spiral descent -- the pilots don't notice as it is all very gentle. And when they look up they don't believe what their instruments tell them and they get disorientated and can't recover."" He highlighted a similar case in 2004 when pilot disorientation and loss of control caused a Flash Airlines Boeing 737-300 to crash in the Red Sea shortly after take off from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh. Though Egyptian authorities disputed the claim, aviation safety officials in France and the U.S. cited ""spatial disorientation"" as the likely cause based on evidence available, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).","Air France Flight 447 plunged into southern Atlantic Ocean killing all 228 people in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Reubin Askew, whose straight-arrow demeanor helped restore many Floridians' trust in government during his two terms as governor in the 1970s, died Thursday. He was 85. He had been admitted Saturday with pneumonia to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, where he then suffered a stroke, former aide and family spokesman Ron Sachs told CNN. ""He was Mr. Integrity,"" said Mike Vasilinda, a journalist at Capitol News Service who has been covering Tallahassee since 1974. ""Governor Askew pushed us into the 20th century."" As governor from 1971 to 1979, Askew secured legislative approval to levy corporate income tax, repealed consumer taxes on household utilities and apartment rentals and doubled homestead exemption amounts. He also pushed through a law requiring public officials to disclose their income sources. ""Everyone called him the guy with the white hat,"" Vasilinda said. Askew was unafraid to roll up his sleeves and pitch in. Vasilinda recalled stopping in at the building where, in the 1970s, the ""Sunshine"" initiative campaign on income disclosure was being spearheaded. There sat the governor. ""He was sitting there counting and organizing petitions by county, so they could be turned in,"" Vasilinda said. Askew's terms coincided with a time of upheaval in government at a national level and in Florida, where three state Supreme Court justices and three cabinet officers had resigned amid scandal. ""He governed at the height of Watergate, when there was huge mistrust,"" Vasilinda said. ""He was the man who gave people confidence that Florida government would run honestly and fairly for everyone."" That passion for equality explained his fervent opposition to segregation, which he expressed through support for busing. ""He felt that busing was a necessity so that people could have equal education,"" Vasilinda said. In 1972, he confronted then-Democratic presidential candidate George Wallace, who was campaigning in Florida on the busing issue. ""Askew took him on directly, and went to the people,"" said historian David Colburn, who met Askew in 1978, wrote about his political career and considered him a friend. Askew had been advised not to jeopardize his political future by getting involved in that battle, but he did not heed the advice. Askew believed that the fight to end segregation in the state ""was about the soul and the future of Florida,"" according to Colburn, who wrote ""From Yellow Dog Democrats to Red State Republicans"" (2013, University Press of Florida) and serves as director of the Bob Graham Center at the University of Florida. Though Askew lost on the busing issue, he proposed a second referendum on providing quality schools for all Florida children, which won. Years later, Askew recalled his handling of busing in a conversation with Colburn. ""I think probably the thing that he said that struck me the most was, 'I felt my job was to help people overcome their fears,'"" Colburn recalled. The question of how Florida would balance aggressive growth and stewardship of the environment was another challenge facing the governor, who assumed office after a decade in which the state's population grew by 2.2 million people, according to Colburn. So Askew brought together 150 state leaders and asked them to consider the direction the state should take, the historian said. The outcome: passage of the Environmental Land and Water Management Act, the Water Resources Act, the Land Conservation Act and the establishment of the division of state planning. He also muscled through a $200 million bond to buy environmentally sensitive land for conservation and parks. As he sought to persuade conservative leaders to sign on to an effort that placed some restrictions on growth, Askew's political prowess rose to the fore. ""He understood how the process worked, and he tried to work through the leadership,"" buttonholing his adversaries and inviting them into the governor's limo, where he would hold them hostage in the back seat and regale them ""until they said they'd listen or agree, or he'd agree to make some changes so he could get their support."" ""When you look at his integrity, belief and support for open government, his commitment to the opportunities for people of all ethnicities and races and backgrounds, his leadership on the environment -- it's an incredible record."" Askew's rectitude extended to his personal life, too. He neither smoked nor drank and did not allow alcohol into the governor's mansion, Vasilinda said. That restriction is widely believed to be the reason that then-Vice President Spiro Agnew changed his plans at the last minute to overnight at the mansion during a visit to Tallahassee in the early 1970s. Security concerns were cited as the official reason. Reubin O'Donovan Askew was born on September 11, 1928, in Muskogee, Oklahoma. He enlisted in the U.S. Army paratroopers in 1946 and was discharged as a sergeant in 1948. He graduated from Florida State University in Tallahassee, where he was student body president; then from the University of Florida Law School, where he was class president. He served as second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force from 1951 to 1953 and began his public career in 1956 as assistant county solicitor for Escambia County. In 1958, he served in the Florida House of Representatives, moving four years later to the Florida Senate, where he served as president pro tempore from 1969 to 1970. Elected governor in 1970, he became the first governor in the state's history to be elected to a second, successive four-year term. In 1956, he married Donna Lou Harper; they had two children. After he left office, Askew went on to teach at all 10 of the state's major public universities, most recently at Florida State University's Askew School of Public Administration and Policy. Though Askew was a Democrat, ""he was not a liberal Democrat,"" said Vasilinda, who went on to become friends with the former governor. ""The Democrats were really moderate Republicans in today's world."" He was a tough taskmaster, according to Vasilinda, who took a master's-level class from the retired politician. ""He would lecture on a different federal and state case every week for an hour and a half, and then the final was just brutal -- it was a 2Â½-hour, handwritten, pencil-and-paper, no-notes final in which he expected you to tell him everything he'd told you.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel approved construction permits for more than 550 settlement units in East Jerusalem, officials said, escalating tensions with Palestinians amid negotiations. The city council committee Wednesday evening approved issuing the construction permits, which is considered the last stage before building of settlements can start. ""The local planning and building committee had dealt with request of private enterprises to approve building permits for 386 units in Har Homa, 136 units in Neve Yakov and 36 units in Pisgat Zeev for plans approved years ago,"" the Jerusalem municipality said in a statement. The areas are considered disputed, with settlements illegal under international law. A member of the municipality council rejected the plans. ""I oppose to this annexation for new buildings, what Israel and the municipality are doing is constructing unilaterally without consultation with anyone,"" said Pepe Alola, who also serves as chairman of Meretz party. An Israeli settlement watch group described it as another blow to peace efforts. ""It's a shameful decision for a government that seeks a solution for a two-state solution would choose to issue so many permits for settlements units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. This is not the first time ... just another development of making a solution for Jerusalem much more difficult,"" said Lior Amihai, deputy director of Peace Now. Palestinian officials said it will sabotage ongoing talks between the two sides. ""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is deliberately sending a strong message to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world that he has no intention of adhering to international law and the will of the international community,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Executive Committee. In July, U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry engaged Israelis and Palestinians to start a nine-month negotiation process that will lead to a framework on future agreements. As the April deadline nears, efforts have not yielded any agreement. Israel seized Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed the city unilaterally, a move the international community does not recognize. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be part of their future state in any final status negotiations. Israel considers Jerusalem its ""eternal and undivided "" capital.","Under international law, new settlements in the disputed area are illegal .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- New York is in Candace Bushnell's blood. The best-selling novelist and columnist has a gift for tapping into the zeitgeist of any New York minute. Smart, chic and driven, her story is also a classic New York success story - she was the girl who came to the city to make it and did so through a desire and determination to succeed. Candace Bushnell: ""Sex and the City was never written to make people feel good."" ""I think people who come here and stay here are, number one, people who always have a dream,"" she told CNN. Bushnell was born on December 1, 1958 in the New England town of Glastonbury, Connecticut. However, at the age of 19 she shunned the idea of a more parochial life for the bright lights of New York in order to pursue her dreams of becoming a professional writer. ""I was going to University in Houston, Texas and I decided that I knew what I wanted to do and it was time to go and do it. I literally ran away from college,"" she told CNN. Whilst enrolled at New York University, and juggling waitressing jobs, she wrote a children's book for publishers Simon and Schuster and received her first big paycheck of $1000. However, this was the first of many different writing jobs Candace undertook over the years. Watch Candace Bushnell take CNN on a tour of New York. » . She wrote for a series of underground papers and publications such as Night Magazine which documented the goings-on of the New York club circuit. By now Candace had herself become a fixture in Manhattan society and a regular at iconic nightclubs like Studio 54. ""For me it wasn't about being a socialite. To be a socialite you had to come from a family who had money. New York is a city where people come to make it. And it doesn't really matter where you come from, but it's all about making it and success."" After graduating from college she worked as a freelancer throughout her twenties. ""I finally got a job on 'Ladies Home Journal,'"" she told CNN. ""The first thing I had to do every morning was sharpen pencils and my boss said I was the best pencil sharpener that they had ever had!"" Bushnell got her real big break when she started writing for the New York Observer in 1993. She soon made an impact as a reporter with stories such as her investigation into burnt out New York celebrities in rehab in Minneapolis. She was given her own column in November 1994 which she called ""Sex and the City"". It chronicled the life, people and stories she had come to know in the Big Apple. The column was an immediate success and became a must-read in New York and it was not long before producers in LA began to take note. It was bought as a book in 1995 and sold to HBO as a series in 1996, which would become the basis for the hit television show and subsequent movie. See the story of ""Sex and the City"" in photos. » . ""It started as a seed, with an absolute truth that people may agree with or it may disturb them. It disturbs me sometimes when I read it because it's very wrong and very honest,"" she told CNN. ""I think most call it cynicism but I call it realism -- it is absolutely raw reality. It was never written for a big audience and it was never written to make people feel good. It was written as the truth in a humorous way."" Since then Bushnell has written another four best-selling books which continue her dark humor and observations of New York society and its characters. Her book ""Lipstick Jungle"", published in 2005, also went on to become a successful television series on NBC. Amidst this success, the one thing Bushnell had not necessarily planned was marriage. The single girl about town, just like her ""Sex and the City"" alter-ego Carrie Bradshaw, it was a surprise even for her to fall for her husband Charles Askegaard, a principal dancer with the New York ballet, whom she met at a gala seven years ago. ""I was cynical about relationships. I wasn't sure about marriage. But when I saw Charles across the room I thought 'that's the man you're going to marry,'"" she said. Candace is now currently working on three more novels, including a young-adult book about Carrie Bradshaw's teenage years in the city. She continues to capture the spirit of the place she has made her home with the flair and drive of a true New Yorker. ""I was a person who was born in a sense with a mission -- I don't always follow it but I always have it and I continue with it.""","Candace Bushnell is the author of five novels, including ""Sex and the City""

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday reinforced the nation's belief in freedom and its constitutional traditions with a ruling that upheld my challenge to a section of the federal election campaign law that restricted citizens' rights to express their views. That outcome, I believe, will become part of a successful attack on the numbing political status quo in Washington and encourage activists across the nation who have fresh ideas to improve how our government operates. I am grass-roots proof that citizens retain some influence and—with determination—can achieve positive change. I hardly suspected such an outcome in late 2011 when I launched my legal challenge. My target was the overall limits on an individual's fully disclosed contributions to federal candidates, national political parties and political action committees. I did not challenge the specific contribution limits in each category. This case is not about limits on the amount of money you may contribute to an individual candidate. It is about your right to contribute that amount to as many candidates as you choose. Allowing individuals to donate to as many candidates as they wish would draw contributions away from PACs and bring money directly to candidates, giving underdog candidates a fair chance in the political arena. Like most Americans, I had little knowledge of these campaign laws—including how the Washington insiders passed them, interpreted them and enforced them. I have spent my adult life as an electrical engineer in the Birmingham, Alabama, area where I grew up and eventually created a small business that has fewer than two dozen employees. I was too busy for politics until five years ago, at age 42, when I joined many other Americans who were disenchanted by what they saw in Washington and decided to take action. Sally Kohn: With ruling, money talks even louder in politics . The core belief that has driven my political activity and my legal challenge has been my full embrace of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. During my political science course as a freshman at Georgia Tech University, I learned about the Supreme Court's landmark 1976 decision that political activity was entitled to that protection. All the sitting justices joined, at least in part, that Buckley vs. Valeo ruling, which found that free and open debate—including unlimited campaign expenditures—is ""integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution."" This week's ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts restated many of those vital national values. Excessive campaign finance restrictions, he wrote, impermissibly inject the government ""into the debate over who should govern."" He pointedly added, ""And those who govern should be the last people to help decide who should govern."" It doesn't take a political scientist to conclude that congressional incumbents have been the chief beneficiaries of these restrictions. Even with the overwhelming public unhappiness with Congress, they typically have re-election rates of roughly 95%. A key factor is that the current system makes it much more difficult for challengers to raise money. In most cases, they simply lack the incumbents' access to tap into Washington's deep-pocketed special interests. This status quo, which has been created chiefly by the so-called political reformers, has had the perverse—but seemingly intended—effect of protecting incumbents in both parties, except for infrequent waves of voter disgust. My objective is to assist challengers in raising funds, and to encourage smarter political ideas. I clearly am not one of those special interests, nor am I one of the billionaires who have become political targets. Friends call me ""your neighbor Shaun."" With other activists, I believe that we can change our politics and draw it closer to our communities. Having become part of public life, I have learned that political conflict and rhetoric sometimes can be hard-ball. But I have made a point of fully respecting other players, even if they criticize me. My support of the First Amendment in this case helps extend those rights to everybody. With the Supreme Court's encouragement, I hope the nation is prepared for a robust and wide-open public debate to address our problems.","Shaun McCutcheon sues to remove overall contribution limit for individuals .

"West Bank (CNN) -- Hundreds of Israeli police swarmed a makeshift Palestinian protest camp early Sunday morning, taking dozens of activists into custody for questioning before releasing them later. The operation marked the latest saga in the bitter back-and-forth over Israel's settlement activity in the West Bank. The camp, which protesters dubbed Bab Alshams, sprung up Thursday, in a roughly 12-square kilometer (5-square mile) area Israel has dubbed E1. In recent weeks, Israel has signaled its intention to construct settlements in the area. Some international leaders have criticized such a plan, as have Palestinian leaders who say it would slice the West Bank in two, cutting it off from the proposed Palestinian capital of East Jerusalem. Q & A: Inside Israel's planned settlement . Mid-day Friday, Israeli authorities gave the protesters 24 hours to leave the site, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. Israel's high court issued an order for the activists' evacuation late Saturday night. ""The notices were given out to all the activists here that they were trespassing,"" Rosenfeld said. Shortly after midnight, more than 500 police officers descended on Bab Alshams to carry out the evacuation order. More than 60 protesters were taken into custody. Around 5 a.m. Sunday (10 p.m. ET Saturday), all those detained had been released, said activist Abir Kopty. Six protesters were injured when officers punched them in the face, according to the Popular Struggle Coordination Committee, the organizers of the Bab Alshams protest camp. ""Even though we were evicted, our strength was apparent since the police needed hundreds and hundreds of special unit police officers,"" the organizers said. ""This is not the end of the popular struggle and it will continue in its full strength."" Rosenfeld denied there were injuries. ""People were taken out carefully one by one,"" he said. The protest camp -- consisting of chanting activists and tents dotting an otherwise barren hilltop -- sprung up due to Israel's recently announced plans to build 3,000 housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Construction in the E1 would be an expansion of Ma'ale Adumim, one of Israel's largest West Bank settlements which already has about 40,000 people. ""We are taking back this area, that is private Palestinian land, and building our own village,"" said activist Irene Nasser. ""We can just look over (at other Israeli settlements) and see what this land might potentially look like, if we don't actually (take) things into our own hands."" Ma'ale Adumim's Mayor Benny Kashriel has cheered this possibility, saying, ""This place, this residential neighborhood, it is in the Ma'ale Adumim municipality, part of ... government land."" But many internationally have condemned further expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, of which there are 137 (with about 325,000 residents), according to the settlement monitoring group Peace Now. Numerous countries -- including Britain, Denmark, France, Spain, Sweden, Australia and Egypt -- summoned Israel's ambassador to hear criticism of the decision, announced late last year, to move forward with the settlement plans. Israel defies international criticism of settlement plans . The Palestinians' chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said such a settlement will dash any hopes of a ""two-state solution"" -- with Israel and an independent Palestinian nation, living together in peace. ""There is no chance for a Palestinian state,"" Erakat has said. ""Anyone who looks at the map, looks at the geography will know exactly that this decision means there is no more two-state solution.""

"(CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown broke his silence Sunday, a week after allegedly attacking his girlfriend, fellow performer Rihanna, on a street in Los Angeles, California. Chris Brown was arrested February 8 on suspicion of making criminal threats. ""Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,"" the 19-year-old said in a statement released by his spokesman. ""I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person."" He added, ""Much of what has been speculated or reported on blogs and/or reported in the media is wrong. While I would like to be able to talk about this more, until the legal issues are resolved, this is all I can say except that I have not written any messages or made any posts to Facebook, on blogs or any place else. Those posts or writings under my name are frauds."" Police are investigating the incident. A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said Wednesday the office needed more information before deciding on whether to charge Brown. Brown was arrested February 8 -- the day of the Grammy Awards, where he was scheduled to perform -- and booked on suspicion of making criminal threats, the spokeswoman said. Brown, who did not appear at the awards show, was released from jail that night on $50,000 bail and given a March 5 court date. Brown's lawyer did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Police said Brown and a woman were in a vehicle near Hollywood's Hancock Park early February 8 when they became involved in an argument. The woman ""suffered visible injuries and identified Brown as her attacker,"" police said. Police did not identify the woman, but sources close to the couple told CNN the alleged victim was his girlfriend, the 20-year-old singer Rihanna, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty. She has made no public comment. Her spokesman issued only a short statement on the evening of February 8, when she canceled her performance at that night's Grammy Awards. ""Rihanna is well,"" her spokesman said at the time. ""Thank you for concern and support."" Police have refused media requests to hear the 911 call that led to their investigation.

"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg kept up Mercedes impressive start to the 2014 Formula One season by posting the fastest time of a tight practice day at the Malaysian Grand Prix. The German driver edged out Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull with a time of one minute and 39.909 seconds in the afternoon session -- but it was close. Just 0.061 seconds separated the three drivers. Rosberg's Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who clocked the fastest time on the morning timesheet, ended the day fourth closely followed by Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Williams' Felipe Massa. Temperatures reached a mercury-busting 50 degrees at the Sepang Circuit, impacting tire performance in the afternoon session. ""It was crazy conditions out there,"" Rosberg, who took the checkered flag at the season opening Australian Grand Prix earlier this month, told the sport's official website. ""In the very, very warm temperatures, it's a huge challenge to get everything right."" ""The tires are behaving very differently from how they did in Australia -- so that'll be my focus. Still, I'm convinced we can make some useful changes to the car overnight."" Rosberg's concerns surrounding the sweltering conditions were echoed by his teammate and 2008 world champion Hamilton. ""It was pretty tough with the temperature and humidity and it's so important to keep hydrated here,"" said the Briton, who was forced to retire from the season's opening race. ""The car feels good and our focus was on trying to understand the tires and make sure the balance is right for the weekend,"" he added. Red Bull rising? Another man pleased with how the sessions went was Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel. The reigning F1 champion and dominant driver pulled out of the Australian Grand Prix after just six laps. He also suffered the indignity of failing to reach the third qualifying stage for the first time since 2012. ""I think we had a good day, obviously Friday timings are not the most important thing in the world but it's good to be up there and in range of the top guys,"" said Vettel. ""There are still some things to solve on the software side and the programming, but that's the way it is. I think we have to learn a lot but all in all, I'm quite happy."" Vettel's Red Bull teammate Danny Ricciardo finished the day seventh fastest, just ahead of Jenson Button of McLaren and Valterri Bottas of Williams. Elsewhere, McLaren rookie Kevin Magnusson failed to capture the speed which saw him finish second at Victoria Park. The Dane ended the day 12th fastest and highlighted the extreme heat as major factor in how his car performed. ""I've never driven a car in these sorts of temperatures, so I learned a lot today, Magnusson said. ""The track temperatures are so hot here that the tyres are really suffering, but it's the same for everyone. ""We need to try and get on top of things before tomorrow's sessions."" Flight MH370 tribute . Before the race at the Sepang Circuit on Sunday teams, drivers and officials are planning a host of tributes to passengers of missing flight MH370. The race track neighbors Kuala Lumpur's main airport where the plane took off on March 8. Lewis Hamilton showed his support for the gesture yesterday, tweeting a picture of his car bearing the hashtag ""#PrayForMH370"" along with the message: ""All my prayers and sympathies go to the friends and families of the passengers on MH370 flight.""","Nico Rosberg fastest in Friday's practice sessions for Malaysian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Germans may be full of indignation at the alleged tapping of Angela Merkel's phone by the U.S National Security Agency -- but the outrage is more than the disappointment of being betrayed by a friend, for the shadows of Germany's past are never far away. Not 25 years ago, Chancellor Merkel was a young scientist behind the Iron Curtain. She grew up a pastor's daughter which, under one party Communist rule in East Germany, put her on the fringes of society. People who moved in religious circles were considered problematic because they often did not conform to the party line. And those who didn't follow party rules came under scrutiny, had their choices of a career and a life limited, and sooner or later became a case for the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany. It was the Stasi, the ""shield and sword"" of the Communist party, that was charged with ensuring the power of the party. And it did that mostly by monitoring of people and their behavior. Because even in a regime as repressive as East Germany, people wanted to express who they really were. Many found the courage to follow their hearts and thus became a danger to the existing power structure. That is why the Stasi became an all-encompassing entity in East Germany. It had to have its eyes and ears everywhere possible to make sure ""enemies"" of the party were uncovered early and disrupted in their activity. OPINION: Merkel's anger is genuine . In the fall of 1989, shortly before the Berlin Wall fell, the Stasi had 91,000 staffers and some 173,000 unofficial collaborators, according to their own files. Many more contributed through official functions to the information gathering of the secret police on co-workers, fellow students, neighbors, visitors, even friends and sometimes family. Any and all technical means, including phone tapping, were used by the Stasi to gather information. Many thousands of people landed in jail for their desire to travel freely, to express their opinions openly and to vote for candidates they wanted -- to exercise their human rights, in essence. When finally people gathered the courage to stand up against the repression of the Communist party, one of the accomplishments of the Peaceful Revolution of 1989 was the opening of the Stasi archive. People demanded the accessibility of these files to reclaim their stolen lives, to make public and transparent the secret system that had kept them under control for so long. Over the past 20 years Germany through the Stasi archives has examined the exact mechanisms of control through the secret police to better understand their vast network of information gathering and its consequences on the lives of many people. This has been a constant part of public debate in Germany. In its course the Stasi became synonymous for blanket surveillance and for uncontrolled access of a state into its own citizens' lives. So when the Chancellor's phone is bugged, Germans don't have the bliss of ignorance as Americans might have. Germans can't convince themselves that surveillance might serve a higher purpose, or that it's acceptable because it's happening to everyone else in the world. Unlike the Americans we have experienced the dangers of a nation that condones unchecked state power. We've seen the results when a state does not respect laws and its citizens' right to privacy and human rights. OPINION: Why White House 'ignorance' doesn't cut it . Granted, it is not as simple as ""the NSA = the Stasi."" We have thoroughly studied the mechanisms of dictatorship so we can sharpen our senses for democracy. What is different today? Phone tapping as a source of information gathering is an intelligence tool regardless of the regime using it. Discussing it in public and demanding stricter rules for its implementation is something that was not possible for four decades in East Germany. It is something we do today, knowing full well the dangers to democracy if we don't. The vast ocean of digital information that each and every one of us contributes to as a consequence of modern life has created a new reality. It has created never before imagined opportunities for businesses, for personal connectivity, for politics, and for intelligence gathering. And it also makes one wonder what the Stasi would have done with a vast information hub like Facebook that would have let it pry into many, many lives and gather personal information beyond its wildest dreams. But it is precisely because of the Stasi's hunger for information and its abuse of East Germany's citizens that we are today so sensitive about modern day surveillance. It is not just about a wiretapped phone -- it is a reminder of the fragility of free societies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dagmar Hovestädt.","Hovestädt: Germans see surveillance differently than U.S. due to Stasi .

"(CNN) -- The date, in that long-gone American spring, was the same as today's: May 19. The year was 1780. The event is mostly forgotten, lost to the mists of history. Many people -- probably most people -- have never heard about it. And the question, on this anniversary of that Day of Darkness, is: . In our constantly connected world, a world in which we are always in touch, always seemingly in the know, could the kind of fear that all but paralyzed the young nation that day still happen? On that day in 1780, at around noon, much of New England -- meaning much of the new America -- went black. At midday, it was midnight. This was not an electrical blackout, of course; homes and businesses did not have electricity in those years, and were illuminated by lanterns and candles. Rather, the sky turned a deep, complete and unrelenting black, erasing the sun. It was not an eclipse. It was not a thunderstorm. Imagine, in the middle of a day in May, every bit of light suddenly and inexplicably disappearing from your world. The citizens were terrified. They waited for the darkness to lift. It did not. Minutes began to feel like months. One contemporaneous observer in Massachusetts, Samuel Williams, a professor at Harvard -- the ""University at Cambridge,"" as he identified it -- wrote: . ""The birds having sung their evening song disappeared and became silent. . .The fowls retired to roost. ... Objects could not be distinguished but at a very little distance; and every thing bore the appearance and gloom of night."" As the daytime hours of blackness wore on, some people, according to historical accounts, began to think that there might never be light again. There was widespread supposition that Judgment Day may have come. In the Connecticut legislature, Abraham Davenport rose to vigorously oppose his colleagues' wish to adjourn: . ""I am against adjournment. The day of judgment is either approaching, or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment; if it is, I choose to be found doing my duty."" The blackness would last for the rest of the afternoon, past twilight and into full night. The next day, the sun would return. People hurried to churches to offer prayers of thanksgiving. Centuries later, scientists would surmise that the Day of Darkness -- widely known as New Engand's Dark Day --- was the result of massive wildfires burning in the forests of Canada. Researchers from the University of Missouri postulated that the smoke from the fires was so thick and so deep in hue, so voluminous, that when, agonizingly slowly, it drifted over New England, it gave the illusion that the sun had died. Today some people may scoff at what might seem like gullibility on the part of those early Americans. But bear in mind that there were no telephones; there was no radio or television; there was no telegraph. People often lived far away from their nearest neighbor. They knew little of what, at a given moment, was happening outside the patch of land where they resided. The one thing a person could always count on -- that the sun would come up in the morning and stay up until evening -- suddenly could not be counted on at all. The Revolutionary War was still being fought. Those 13 British colonies on a sliver of the East Coast were the forerunners of what would become the 50 United States. So the citizens, many feeling completely isolated on the eastern edge of a continent that remained largely unexplored, might be excused for fearing the worst. The poet John Greenleaf Whittier would write of that day: . ""Over the fresh earth and the heaven of noon, . A horror of great darkness, like the night . In day of which the Norland sagas tell, . The Twilight of the Gods. The low-hung sky . Was black with ominous clouds, save where its rim . Was fringed with a dull glow, like that which climbs . The crater's sides from the red hell below. Birds ceased to sing, and all the barn-yard fowls . Roosted; the cattle at the pasture bars . Lowed, and looked homeward; bats on leathern wings . Flitted abroad; the sounds of labor died; . Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp . To hear the doom-blast of the trumpet shatter. . . ."" So it was on May 19, 1780. On May 19, 2013, with all of our vaunted communication abilities -- 24-hour television news, universal cellphones, Twitter, Facebook, the all-but-countless ways to stay in touch -- would such an event merit merely a shrug? Would we figure out within minutes what was transpiring, and why, and would we wait patiently for the sun to reappear? Perhaps. But consider what happens when the power goes out -- when, without warning, we lose artificial light. Consider the confusion and anger and uncertainty that often commences. Would we really be calm and unconcerned if, just as suddenly, real light -- the sun's light -- without notice went away? Or would our cherished communications tools spread rumors of conspiracies and attacks and impending doom? Would those tools create panic instead of prevent it? Whittier, in his poem, wrote of the cessation of the day of darkness: . ""And, shore-ward, o'er the waters gleamed, . From crest to crest, a line of light, . Such as of old, with solemn awe, . The fishers by Gennesaret saw. . . ."" Fear of the dark; love of the light. Some things change as the years pass. Others, we are from time to time reminded, remain eternal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","On May 19, 1780, the skies over New England inexplicably turned black .

"Kaufman, Texas (CNN) -- Kaufman County is on edge. Two prosecutors killed in two months, including the district attorney, gunned down in his home over the weekend. What's going on? Is someone assassinating prosecutors? As armed guards surround the Kaufman County Courthouse and police shrouded some public officials in around-the-clock protection, it seems there are as many questions as answers. Prosecutor gunned down outside Texas courthouse . District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were shot to death, nearly two months after one of his assistants died in a brazen daytime shooting outside the north Texas county's courthouse. A search warrant affidavit stated the couple was found dead Saturday evening by friends who had tried to reach them several times during the day. Each of them had been shot multiple times, the affidavit states. McLelland talked to relatives on Friday night, the affidavit states. Investigators have asked a judge for records of mobile phone calls that were relayed through at least one nearby tower, the documents show. The killings followed warnings that a white supremacist group might be preparing to take revenge on law enforcement officials who targeted them in 2012. It's unclear whether the McLelland killings were linked to the January 31 shooting death of Kaufman County assistant prosecutor Mark Hasse, or to the March 19 death of the prisons chief in Colorado. Authorities say a suspect in that shooting was a onetime white supremacist gang member who died in a shootout with deputies -- in north Texas. ""This whole thing is shocking to all of us,"" said Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood during a Monday news conference. ""I would be less than honest if I told you I was not worried."" Michael Burns, McLelland's law school classmate, longtime friend and fellow district attorney, said that after Hasse's killing, McLelland told him, ""They better come prepared because there'll be a fight."" Both Kaufman County prosecutors apparently started carrying guns, but it wasn't enough. Brandi Fernandez, McLelland's first assistant district attorney, will take over the office on an interim basis until Gov. Rick Perry can appoint a successor, county officials announced. Latest shooting . The McLellands' bodies were found Saturday at their home in the Dallas suburb of Forney. A law enforcement source told CNN that investigators have recovered several shell casings from a .223-caliber rifle. Mike Griffith, whose yard backs up to the McLellands', told CNN affiliate WFAA-TV he thinks he heard the attack unfolding early Saturday. ""It was five or six shots, one right after the other,"" WFAA quoted Griffith as saying. The deaths came almost exactly two months after Hasse was shot dead and the day McLelland vowed to bring his killer -- he used the word ""scum"" -- to justice. ""We're going to pull you out of whatever hole you're in, we're going to bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,"" he said. Hasse had feared for his life and carried a gun to work, said a Dallas attorney who described herself as his longtime friend. Colleen Dunbar said she spoke with Hasse a week before he died and he told her he had begun carrying a gun at work. ""He told me he would use a different exit every day because he was fearful for his life,"" Dunbar told CNN. She said that Hasse gave no specifics on why he felt threatened, only that he did. A neighbor said Cynthia McLelland had been concerned that Hasse wouldn't be the only person killed, but she thought her husband would be OK. ""And I said, 'What about Mike? You think he's safe?' And she said, 'Yeah, I'm not worried about about Mike,' "" David Crone told WFAA. Are killings retribution? Authorities insist that they just don't know who may be behind the killings. However, McLelland's office was one of numerous Texas and federal agencies involved in a multiple-year investigation that led to the 2012 indictment of 34 alleged members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, including four of its senior leaders, on racketeering charges. At the time, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lanny A. Breuer called the indictment a ""devastating blow"" to the organization, which he said used threats and violence, including murder, against ""those who violate (its) rules or pose a threat to the enterprise."" The FBI describes the group as a ""whites only,"" prison-based gang with members operating inside and outside of state and federal prisons throughout Texas and elsewhere in the United States since at least the early 1980s."" While authorities have not said whether they have established a link between the deaths of Hasse and McLelland, or the involvement of white supremacists, Texas law enforcement agencies did warn shortly after the November 2012 indictment that there was ""credible information"" that members of the Aryan Brotherhood were planning to retaliate"" for the indictment. Wood said Monday that no physical evidence links McLelland's death and Hasse's, although previously he had said he believes there is a ""strong connection"" between the killings. In an interview with The Associated Press after Hasse's death, McLelland said his deputy hadn't been involved in the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas investigation. But the district attorney nevertheless raised the possibility the group was behind his death. ""We put some real dents in the Aryan Brotherhood around here in the past year,"" McLelland told the news agency. In the AP interview, McLelland said he, too, began carrying a gun after Hasse's death and was answering his door more carefully. Pete Schulte, a criminal defense attorney who has worked in the county, said other lawyers and public servants were nervous. ""Having that type of environment going on where people who are just doing their jobs (and) getting assassinated -- this is what this is, elected officials getting assassinated -- and that is sending a chill through the (legal) community and the community in general,"" he said. Schulte speculated that the killings were ""personal."" ""If this was a case that somebody was trying to change, they would have been going after witnesses and not the prosecuting attorney,"" he said. Colorado slaying . As if the potential links between Hasse and McLelland's shootings weren't enough, speculation has also extended to whether the shootings have any connection to the March 19 death of Colorado prisons chief Tom Clements, who was gunned down after answering the door to his house. While authorities have offered no suggestion the crimes are linked, the man suspected of killing Clements was once a member of a white supremacist group, the 211 Crew. That man, Evan Ebel, died in a shootout with sheriff's deputies in northern Texas. Other explanations . The white supremacist angle is just one of many possibilities, the Dallas Morning News quoted McLelland's former boss in the Dallas public defender's office as saying. ""It could be local meth lab people down there in Kaufman County, it could be Mexican cartel, it could be the Aryan Brotherhood,"" the newspaper quoted Former Dallas Chief Public Defender Brad Lollar as saying. ""Or it could just be someone with a personal grudge."" On heightened alert . The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives joined Texas Rangers, the FBI and local authorities in investigating the killing of McLelland and his wife, the agency's Dallas office spokesman, Andrew Young, told CNN. Several dozen FBI agents and support staff are now assisting the investigation, said Katherine Chaumont, a spokeswoman for the bureau's Dallas field office. In Houston, Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia put District Attorney Mike Anderson and his family under 24-hour security, said Sara Marie Kinney, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office. Anderson's office was part of the same task force as Kaufman County authorities. Mayor Fortner said Monday on CNN's Starting Point the fear is pervasive. ""I wonder if the governor is going to find anyone brave enough to take the job of district attorney,"" he said. CNN's Ed Lavandera reported from Kaufman County; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Joe Sutton, Matt Smith, Carol Cratty and AnneClaire Stapleton also contributed to this report.","Neighbor tells CNN affiliate that DA's wife was 'not worried' about him .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave Britain on their three-week visit to New Zealand and Australia this weekend with their baby son Prince George. A ""hub and spoke"" system has been put in place allowing for the new parents to travel to engagements during the day and return to their son in the evening, much like parents the world over who trudge off to work in the morning only to dash home in the evening to catch baby before bedtime. Granted most parents in the workforce don't get to enjoy legions of adoring fans waving flags, parading ""We love u!"" banners and requesting royal selfies, but perhaps this will give William and Kate a taste of their much-longed-for opportunity to feel ""normal."" It comes as no surprise that George is joining the royal roadshow, but it is Prince William's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who is being credited, yet again, with paving the way for her son and grandson. Pundits promptly took to their columns comparing the cold, unfeeling Queen Elizabeth -- who left her children behind as she took off on a six-month tour -- to Diana who defied convention and broke with tradition by insisting on taking a then nine-month-old Prince William to Australia and New Zealand in 1983. In order to do a fair comparison, however, surely we must look at the big picture. A full 30 years had passed between royal tours, during which time advances in modern aviation made travel much speedier. People's attitudes towards royalty had shifted, and as popular as she was, Diana was merely a princess ... not the Queen. Aussie hysteria may have made Prince Charles and Princess Diana's trip Down Under look like quite the rock star tour, but when the Queen and Prince Philip set off in 1953, the world was on the cusp of global hysteria. In Bermuda alone, all 38,000 residents of the island nation rolled out to get a glimpse of their new queen. In the days before Internet, social media, 24-hour TV news -- when most families still gathered around the wireless to hear the day's events -- theirs was the biggest show in town. The royal couple embarked on the six-month tour of the Commonwealth just five months after her coronation. They were to travel across five continents on the most ambitious royal tour ever undertaken. The countries to be visited included Canada, Jamaica, Panama, Fiji, Tonga, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Libya, Australia and New Zealand -- most of which had never seen a reigning British monarch set foot on its soil. Over the course of the trip the Queen covered 43,618 miles by land, air and sea. She was pulled in every direction, and so strenuous was the tour that there were concerns for her health. The decision had been made to leave Prince Charles and his sister Anne at home. Modern child-rearing experts might say the best place for a child is with its parents, but anyone who has flown 23 hours with an infant might beg to differ. Imagine if you will flying 17 hours to Bermuda on a four-engine prop with two toddlers in tow and not a Nintendo or iPad to be seen. You'd have gotten drunk twice and still landed sober. Relief on landing would be instantly mitigated by marching bands and a slew of dignitaries waiting to greet your fried and frazzled self. Picture then a five-year-old Prince Charles face down on the tarmac, kicking his little hands and feet at having to wear long white socks as his three-year-old sister Anne, a veritable shade of puce, screams, ""I want my pony!"" No doubt the royal spawn would have been much more mild-mannered, but you can see how quickly things could head south in a haze of Governors, Honor Guards, Tribal Chiefs and jet lag ... and that's only the first leg. A thoroughly miserable experience for parents and tots alike. On a personal level, it must have been a horrendous decision for the Queen to leave her children behind, but it's not as if they were left in a Dickensian workhouse. Rather, they were left in the loving care of a doting grandmother and a nanny whom they adored. Jumping ahead 30 years, Diana did indeed insist on taking William on her six-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. While not exactly a short hop, the family did enjoy the benefits of jet propulsion and first class. On landing in Alice Springs there was not a marching band or honor guard to be seen, simply a few local officials who frankly were more interested in seeing baby William. After a brief photo call, William and his nanny were whisked away to Woomargama, a working sheep and cattle ranch in southern Australia. William was to stay there throughout the trip, and his parents had made plans to visit nine times. William and Kate are taking things a step further next month by only being parted from George for a couple of nights during their three-week inaugural tour as a family. Revolutionary as Diana was, it is due to the Queen's forward thinking that the monarchy has continued to adapt and evolve, and that William and Kate are now able to reap the benefits. In hindsight, it is easy to criticize the Queen for being a bad mother and abandoning her children, but had she stayed home and abandoned her royal duties, the critics would have screamed even louder. Nothing happens without the Queen's approval. Yes, Diana was permitted to take William on tour, but you can bet it was as a result of having to leave her own children behind that the Queen gave the go-ahead. Diana should be credited for many of the positive changes within the monarchy, but it is the Queen who should be given the credit this time around.

"London (CNN) -- With Afghanistan heading to the polls on Saturday, concerns have been voiced about likely electoral irregularities. Abdullah Abdullah, a former foreign minister and leading presidential candidate, has warned the ballot will be marred by ""industrial scale fraud"" to rival the 1 million votes that were disqualified in the 2009 elections. Despite these concerns, and the prospect of Taliban attacks at polling stations, the ballot is nonetheless a watershed moment in the country's history. It heralds the first democratic transfer of power, and also the end of the post-9/11 Karzai era. Some 13 years after the fall of the Taliban regime, President Hamid Karzai is bequeathing a mixed legacy. To be sure, there are grounds for optimism. Since 2001, for instance, the economy has grown rapidly, and women have more opportunities in much of the country. And as the election underlines, a nascent, albeit dysfunctional, democracy may be taking root after years of Taliban oppression. But the most likely prospect is greater economic, political and security instability. And, this is despite the blood and treasure expended by U.S. and Western militaries since 2001 -- about 3,500 international coalition forces lives lost, and almost $700 billion spent by the U.S. military alone. Whether Afghanistan prospers, or implodes, will be determined in part by the new president's success in dealing with a complex set of inter-related issues including: trying to forge a security deal with Washington and its NATO partners beyond 2014; pursuing the reconciliation agenda and a possible peace agreement with the Taliban; and preventing an economic downturn as foreign aid is reduced. Of the original 27 candidates approved by the Electoral Commission, only eight remain. Yet the ballot outcome is uncertain, partly because of electoral fraud. As well as Abdullah Abdullah, who finished second in the 2009 presidential election, the two other leading candidates are widely seen to be Ashraf Ghani, an economist and former World Bank executive, and Zalmai Rassoul, a former foreign minister. Given the absence of an obvious front-runner, it appears likely no one will secure 50% of the vote to win outright. Thus, a run-off ballot would be required, delaying the outcome several more weeks. Once elected, the priority for the new president will be bolstering domestic security, and Abdullah, Ghani and Rassoul have endorsed the need for a long-term deal with U.S. and NATO forces. However, to create the ""political space"" for what would be a controversial agreement with some of the populace, the new president will need to secure concessions from Washington. This could mean protracted negotiations which will frustrate the Obama administration. While it is likely than a deal will be reached, there is a possibility that U.S. and NATO forces may pull out completely in 2014. This could prove catastrophic for the new government, potentially leading to its eventual collapse. This is widely recognized internationally, but the military presence in Afghanistan is unpopular in many Western countries. Moreover, delays in signing a deal (Washington hoped to reach agreement last year with Karzai) means logistical and personnel complications of extending the international troop presence are growing. Key issues to be resolved between the new president and Washington include: any continuing U.S. mandate to perform counter-terrorism mission in Afghanistan; extending immunity for U.S. military personnel; and the fate of Taliban prisoners. All of these are points where the new government will walk a tightrope between keeping Washington on side, while not torpedoing the peace dialogue with the Taliban. Should a security deal be secured, a residual U.S. and NATO force of 8,000-12,000 troops is most likely. Importantly, this agreement would also ensure funding and training for Afghan security forces which may otherwise disintegrate. However, Afghanistan still faces the prospect of instability from a Taliban counter-offensive. Hence, the reason why another priority for the new president will be advancing reconciliation with the Taliban toward a potential final settlement. Pakistan's influence could be key in facilitating any deal. While doubts remain about that country's ability and willingness to facilitate such an agreement, last week Pakistani government representatives entered into formal peace talks with the Taliban in North Waziristan. Turning to the economic front, the new president will come into office at a difficult moment. Since 2001, the economy has become more dependent on foreign aid. Economic risks would be intense in the event of a withdrawal of international troops. This could see aid cut back, partly because agencies would no longer be able to operate under an international security umbrella. Another problem the new government faces is that there has been only limited success in economic diversification since 2001, with the extractives sector the only exception. The clear danger is that, as aid is reduced, the economy becomes more dependent upon illegal drug exports such as opium and heroin. Taken overall, Afghanistan is therefore at a major inflexion point. A successful, decisive transfer of power combined with an eventual reconciliation deal with the Taliban could consolidate power and legitimacy of the new president, helping preserve some of the fragile gains since 2001. But if international forces withdraw completely in 2014, the eventual collapse of the government becomes a real possibility. READ: Amanpour's Afghan presidential interviews .

"(CNN) -- A group of Columbus, Ohio, police officers hopped on the Powerball bandwagon, but unlike the majority of ticket buyers, the players will walk away from the frenzy $1 million richer. The majority of approximately 20 officers work either in the department's forgery or auto theft unit, according to department spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner. ""It's nothing anyone can really retire from, but a lot of people are going to have a nice holiday season,"" said Weiner, who was not involved in the pool that purchased the tickets. The group's ticket had the five winning numbers, but their Powerball number was one off from the winning Powerball 6 -- a not-so-lucky number 5, according to Weiner. The group planned to come forward late Thursday, according to the Ohio Lottery Commission. Once confirmed, they officers will share the winnings.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Their timing was a little off. The New York Dolls recently released their second album since regrouping. The new CD is ""'Cause I Sez So."" In January, the New York Dolls arrived in Hawaii to record their new album, ""'Cause I Sez So"" (Atco), with producer Todd Rundgren. The producer, who has a setup on the island of Kauai, assured the band that the weather would be beautiful. Not quite. ""It rained every day,"" said guitarist and singer David Johansen in Atlanta's Center Stage theater Friday, where the band was scheduled to play later that day. ""It rained just enough to disrupt our recording plans,"" added guitarist Steve Conte. ""Todd has this house with one wall open to the elements, and I said, 'What happens when it rains, Todd?' and he said, 'It never rains here.' Well, the next day, all our gear got soaked, so we had to move to another house."" That kind of timing is a familiar subject to the Dolls, which formed amid the grit and grind of early '70s New York but broke up before they could take advantage of the success of followers such as the Ramones, Blondie, the Sex Pistols and Talking Heads. The band ""created punk rock before there was a term for it,"" writes Allmusic.com's Stephen Thomas Erlewine. The original band, made up of Johansen, Sylvain Sylvain, Johnny Thunders, Arthur Kane and Jerry Nolan, were known for ferocious live performances that blended elements of the Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground, glam and girl groups -- down to the occasional wearing of drag. ""We came out of the era of stadium rock ... when rock 'n' roll was put together by the industry,"" Sylvain recalled. ""We take like a Little Rascals approach to show business -- 'We're bored! What are we gonna do? Well, let's start a show!' And that's basically how the Dolls came about.""  Watch Johansen describe the kids who followed them down the street » . Sylvain, with Johansen one of the two survivors of the old Dolls (Thunders and Nolan died in the early '90s, and Kane died of leukemia in 2004), is philosophical about the band's inability to break through. ""It's what happened to us,"" he said, adding, ""once we did break up, unlike other bands, we were actually successful individually."" Indeed, the musicians worked regularly through the ensuing decades, notably Johansen, who became perhaps better known for his good-time nightclub singer character Buster Poindexter and the hit ""Hot Hot Hot."" The band came back together at the request of Dolls fan Morrissey, who was overseeing a festival in London, England. ""He asked us to do a night for him. And we decided that that would be a lot of fun,"" said Johansen. ""We actually came into this thing just to do one show. It wasn't like we said, 'We're going to have some kind of re-uuuunion thing,' "" he adds, mockingly slurring ""reunion."" But one thing led to another, and before long the Dolls were a working band again. In 2006 they released ""One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This."" ""'Cause I Sez So"" came out in May. It's a familiar mix of hard rock -- the bitter lashing of the title cut, the ecstatic grunge of ""Exorcism of Despair"" -- with Johansen playfulness (""Nobody Got No Bizness""), classic pop (""Lonely So Long"") and even a reggae remake of the first album's ""Trash."" Johansen -- who regularly hosts ""David Johansen's Mansion of Fun,"" a Sirius radio show reveling in his broad musical tastes -- is proud of the band's agility. ""When we get together to play, it's not like we're punching a clock and doing a recreation of yesterday,"" he said. ""We go on every day with a fresh attitude and just start playing. The music can go everywhere."" ""We don't really think about [being pigeonholed],"" added Sylvain. ""We just kind of fly by the seat of our pants. It's for everybody else to see it whatever which way they do. ... Call it punk, call it whatever you want, but it's rock 'n' roll to us."" The new album came together in about a month -- half as long as the first album, also produced by Rundgren, back in 1973. ""We're mad professional now,"" said Johansen. Johansen, Sylvain and the rest of the band -- Conte, bassist Sam Yaffa and drummer Brian Delaney -- interact as much like a comedy act as a rock band, with frequent pauses for deadpan jokes. It's a vibe that's apparent on "" 'Cause I Sez So,"" which has earned a number of positive reviews. ""The unlikely resurrection of the New York Dolls is solidified by this second recent album, an output that now matches in quantity and mirrors in quality their epic early-'70s sprint,"" wrote Billboard's Wayne Robins. The group is touring the United States and Canada throughout June before leaving for Europe in mid-July. The audiences, Sylvain said, have been appreciative -- and broader than in their downtown New York past. ""We've had some great audiences. And of all ages, actually,"" he said. Johansen interrupted. ""When the kids come, we give them a balloon."" Sylvain smiled. ""And earplugs,"" he said.","The New York Dolls were punk pioneers, putting out two albums in early '70s .
Group didn't achieve big success then, though they were very influential .
Group reformed in 2004; new album, "" 'Cause I Sez So,"" has old ferocious energy ."
"(CNN) -- Liverpool moved to the top of the English Premier League with a 4-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield on Sunday. Two goals in either half saw Spurs soundly beaten by the Reds for the second time this season -- Brendan Rodgers' side handed out a 5-0 thrashing at White Hart Lane last December. After laboring to victory over Sunderland in midweek, Liverpool returned to their more fluent ways with another lively attacking display. Spurs defender Younes Kaboul helped them on their way with an own goal in the second minute. The French center-back turned Glen Johnson's low cross past Hugo Lloris and was at fault for Liverpool's second as well in the 25th minute. This time, Kaboul mis-controlled a sloppy pass from substitute Michael Dawson (on for injured Jan Vertonghen) allowing Luis Suarez to steal in for his 29th goal in 26 league games with a pinpoint shot past Lloris' outstretched fingers. The Uruguayan nearly scored again four minutes before the break, but this time the French goalkeeper repelled him, palming a fierce header onto the crossbar before the ball rebounded to safety. Liverpool continued the second half where they left off the first, enjoying the lion's share of possession and creating chances. Jordan Henderson should have put the game to bed in the 53rd minute but fired wastefully over after being teed up by Raheem Sterling. It mattered not. Two minutes later, Philippe Coutinho ended a purposeful run with an emphatic 20-yard drive to sink Spurs. The match was over, but Liverpool weren't done yet as Henderson made up for his earlier miss with a 75th-minute free kick which found its way through a crowd of players and into the net. Liverpool's eighth league win in a row means they move two points clear of Chelsea at the top of the table with 71 points from 32 games. Jose Mourinho's side slumped to a 1-0 defeat away to Crystal Palace on Saturday, giving credence to the Portuguese manager's long-held assertion that the Blues are not favorites for this year's title. Earlier on Sunday, Everton stepped up the pressure on fourth-placed Arsenal with a 3-1 win over struggling Fulham at Craven Cottage. Roberto Martinez's team have now won their last five league games and stay in fifth, while Fulham's fourth loss in five leaves them anchored to the foot of the table with 24 points with six matches remaining. Everton now have 60 points, leaving them four behind Arsenal ahead of the Gunners' trip to Goodison Park next Sunday. In Italy, third-placed Napoli beat Serie A leaders Juventus 2-0 allowing second-placed Roma -- who beat Sassuolo 2-0 earlier in the day -- to close the gap at the top of the table to 11 points. There were also wins for Lazio, who beat Parma 3-2; Hellas Verona were 3-0 winners over Genoa and Torino beat Cagliari 2-1. Sampdoria and Fiorentina drew 0-0. Meanwhile in Spain, there were wins for Getafe who beat Valencia 3-1 and Valladolid who overcame Almeria 1-0. La Liga's other two fixtures ended in stalemate with both Osasuna and Real Sociedad and Villarreal's match with Elche finishing 1-1.

"(CNN) -- Campaign 2014 is in full swing with primary voting, and incumbents and challengers busy raising money. Now the first task for every federal candidate in this midterm election year will be to read the Supreme Court's ruling on campaign finance for a reality check. The 40-page decision handed down on Wednesday promises to continue a transformation over how donations and spending on elections are conducted. The court's 5-4 ruling threw out congressionally mandated limits on the total one can give to all federal candidates in an election cycle. The practical effect: it would allow well-heeled donors to spread the wealth to give to more candidates and political groups. Toobin: High court gives rich more say in elections . But current limits on giving to an individual candidate -- $5,200 -- remain in place and were never at issue before the justices. There is disagreement on how much of an impact this narrow decision will have in money terms as billions of dollars fuel today's campaign process overall. But the larger implications could be huge, played out for years to come in a variety of continuing challenges to current restrictions. ""Every time this current Supreme Court has confronted a campaign finance restriction, it's struck it down,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. ""It has been on a slow but steady march towards deregulation, towards saying that restrictions on your spending money -- say, in expenditures or in contributions to candidates -- that is a free speech right."" Breyer's lament . Justice Stephen Breyer sounded forlorn Wednesday, lamenting in sad tones the effect of the Supreme Court ruling. Speaking from the bench, Breyer -- supported by his three more liberal colleagues -- criticized the conservative majority for ignoring a century of efforts to blunt political corruption -- or its appearance. ""The threat to that integrity posed by the risk of special access and influence remains real,"" he said. The ruling ""eviscerates our nation's campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intend to resolve,"" he added. But Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion, acknowledged what many a smart election lawyer knows: . ""Because individuals' direct contributions are limited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for political speech"" than direct contributions to office-seekers, said Roberts. ""Individuals can, for example, contribute unlimited amounts to 501(c) organizations, which are not required to publicly disclose their donors. Such organizations spent some $300 million on independent expenditures in the 2012 election cycle."" Roberts emphasized the free-speech rights of donors and downplayed the concerns the ruling would further erode public confidence in the political system. ""The government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse,"" he said. The man behind the ruling . Shaun McCutcheon is an electrical engineer by trade, but grassroots politics may be his true passion. The Alabama native has worked for years with his local Republican Party in Birmingham, and is chairman of Conservative Action Fund, a so-called ""super PAC"" that ""promotes conservative Republicans' time-proven messages and effective solutions."" His success in business and a willingness to put his money into GOP coffers set him at the center of the politically tricky Supreme Court fight. He equates his donations to ""core political speech."" McCutcheon says he has a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wants, so long as no one candidate gets more than the $2,600 per election limit. He supports those individual controls, but ""what doesn't make any sense is that you can only give that amount of money to a few candidates, because somehow my giving money to (U.S. Rep.) Martha Roby of Alabama could corrupt (former Rep.) Allen West of Florida,"" he told CNN. ""That's just nutty, but that's what the powers-that-be want: to prevent folks who want to get involved from having the same ability to get involved and support candidates that big union PACs have,"" he said. But backers of continued congressional regulation do not see it that way. ""The reason we have limitations on the dollars an individual can give is to create some sense of fairness, so that if we do have a campaign finance system driven by donations, we have as many opportunities for as many people as possible to participate,"" said Robert Zimmerman, a prominent Democratic fundraiser. ""That's why there are limitations, so that everyone has an equal or fair voice in the process. Not only are our elections being put up for auction, these donors are making an investment in the democratic system for their own agenda and we taxpayers have to foot the bill,"" he said. Fundamental debate . The competing arguments are stark: supporters of campaign finance reform say current federal regulations are designed to prevent corruption in politics. Opponents said it would criminalize free speech and association. The current case deals with direct political contributions. But it continues a trend that culminated in the separate ""Citizens United"" high court ruling from 2010, easing long-standing restrictions on ""independent spending"" by corporations, labor unions, and certain non-profit advocacy groups in political campaigns. Its impact put corporations on the same free-speech footing as wealthy individuals, who have long enjoyed the ability to spend freely and independently on behalf of federal candidates. That and a subsequent decision from a federal appeals court in Washington have led to a proliferation of so-called ""super PACs""-- separate political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash from businesses, unions, and advocacy groups. These super PACs are independent political organizations operating as ""527s,"" named after the tax code governing their operation. They cannot contribute directly to a federal candidate or political party. Limits on direct contributions to candidates by corporations and individuals remain in place, the focus in part of the current McCutcheon appeal. Some political experts say a ruling in favor of increased, or even unlimited, aggregate individual donor contributions could put party committees and political action committees on a greater competitive track with the ""super PACs."" All PACs are organizations that campaign either for or against candidates, legislation, or ballot measures. The difference is in how they are organized for regulatory and tax purposes, and by the amounts of money they are allowed to spend. Regular PACs may also give limited donations to federal candidates and political parties, while super PACs cannot. With a resounding win at the high court, wealthy donors like McCutcheon -- whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent -- could in theory contribute a maximum $3.6 million to the national and state parties, and the 450 or so Senate and House candidates expected to run in 2014. Key for the conservative majority court was rejecting claims by the law's supporters that it had a permissible goal of preventing political corruption or the appearance of it. Another point of contention is whether the aggregate spending limits are really having a pervasive effect, or only involve a relative few well-heeled givers. Figures from the Center for Responsive Politics for the 2012 race showed about 600 donors leveraged their money to each give the maximum of about $48,000 total -- benefitting no more than 17 presidential or congressional candidates. Almost 1,700 contributors forked over the maximum limit to party committees, which added up to more than $100 million. Loosening those limits, say opponents of the law, would benefit wealthy liberals and conservatives equally. Lax enforcement . But the Supreme Court has never in its history overturned a federal contribution limit. And critics accuse regulators of having a generally lax enforcement stance, particularly for independent advocacy groups. The FEC will now be tasked with taking this high court opinion and crafting new rules to ease limits on aggregate spending. Unlike in ""Citizens United,"" the big winners may be harder to discern. Certainly individual donors seeking to expand their election portfolio have more choices. But as Roberts noted, other big-move avenues exist to funnel money to outside groups willing to spend freely. And political parties certainly will have more money to spend. That worries many supporters of more regulation. ""The court opens another loophole by allowing our political parties to be further corrupted by big-money contributions from special interests,"" said Elisabeth MacNamara, president of the League of Women Voters of the U.S. ""The party and PAC systems now become a huge funnel for corrupting elected officials across the country."" But McCutcheon argues that characterizing the legal fight as between ""good"" and ""bad"" simply blurs the truth. ""Getting rid of the aggregate limits is not about corrupting democracy -- it is about practicing democracy,"" he said. ""This case is about freedom-- your freedom and my freedom-- to express ourselves openly and fully within our political system. And if there is one thing that we Americans believe with all our hearts, it is that freedom never corrupts."" The case is McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (12-536).","A campaign finance reality check for candidates running in this year's midterms .

"LONDON, England -- Scientists in the U.S. are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes. The WHO has reported that around half of the world's population is at risk of malaria. The laser, which has been dubbed a ""weapon of mosquito destruction"" fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of its wings. The laser beam then destroys the mosquito, burning it on the spot. Developed  by some of the astrophysicists involved in what was known as the ""Star Wars"" anti-missile programs during the Cold War, the project is meant to prevent the spread of malaria. Lead scientist on the project, Dr. Jordin Kare, told CNN that the laser would be able to sweep an area and ""toast millions of mosquitoes in a few minutes."" Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people from the bites of female mosquitoes. It is particularly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and kills an African child every 30 seconds, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally, resulting in more than one million deaths, the WHO reports. Responding to questions about any potential harm the laser could pose to the eco-system, Kare said: ""There is no such thing as a good mosquito, there's nothing that feeds exclusively on them. No one would miss mosquitoes,"" he said. ""In any case,"" he added. ""The laser is able to distinguish between mosquitoes that go after people and those that aren't dangerous. What remains to be seen is how precise we can get."" He added that other insects would not be affected by the laser's beam. Kare said the lasers could be mounted on lamp post-type poles and put around the circumference of villages, to create a kind of ""fence"" against mosquitoes. The research was commissioned by Intellectual Ventures, a Washington, U.S.-based company that was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft Corporation executive. His previous boss, Bill Gates, who funded the research, asked Myhrvold to look into new ways of combating malaria.","Scientists are developing a laser that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes .

"(CNN) -- A new video of last year's Asiana Airlines plane crash in San Francisco shows firefighters spotting a 16-year-old Chinese girl lying on the ground, but failing to help her, an attorney for the girl's family charges. Ye Meng Yuan was later run over by two different fire trucks, killing her, said Justin Green, a lawyer for the girl's family. The newly released video challenges an account by fire officials that the Chinese teenager was accidentally run over because she may have been covered in firefighting foam, Green asserts. In fact, the video depicts one firefighter alerting a truck driver about how ""there's a body right there."" In the footage, a firefighter stops an emergency vehicle racing toward the scene. ""Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop, stop! There's a body ... there's a body right there. Right in front of you,"" the firefighter told the driver. The video was captured on a camera attached to a firefighter's helmet and first aired by CBS. Another video from a fire truck shows a firefighter on the ground directing the truck around a victim, who was not covered in foam at the time. Ye's parents have filed a gross negligence claim against the city and county of San Francisco, arguing that the emergency responders who spotted Ye on the ground failed to save her life. No charges for firefighter who ran over Asiana crash survivor . Ye was on the plane traveling from her China home to an American summer camp and was her parents' only child, under China's one-child policy, Green said. ""It's unthinkable, it's unimaginable, because the first thing that -- the first priority of the firefighters or any rescue personnel is saving lives,"" Green said of the video. ""And the first step in triage is to take the pulse, check the respiration. That was never done. ""And the video, which I think is the best evidence of what happened, shows at least five firefighters who saw her, who understood she was there, and none of them did the basic step of checking if she was alive,"" Green told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" The tire of first fire vehicle ran over the girl's head, and then a second fire vehicle, which wasn't equipped with a spotter to help maneuver it, ran over her body, Green said. A California coroner ruled that Ye was alive when flung from the plane but died of ""multiple blunt injuries that are consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle."" ""Those injuries she received, she was alive at the time,"" San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin expressed caution, however, in interpreting the video. ""To create this image of the firefighters as incompetent villains here based on a tape that's been edited, as I understand it, by the plaintiff's lawyers here, I mean, I think it's important to reserve judgment,"" Toobin said, while acknowledging ""the horrible pain"" the girl's family is now enduring. ""This is a complicated situation where the chronology is very important. And you know, we're not talking about a traffic accident where there is one body on the floor -- and, of course, firefighters should check that. We're looking at a situation where firefighters are potentially looking at hundreds of casualties and are trying to deal with that,"" Toobin said. Two other people died when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash-landed July 6 at the San Francisco International Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board said the jet descended in altitude faster than it should have, and had a slower forward speed than intended.

"KANSAS CITY, Kansas (CNN) -- Army Spc. Jeremy Hall was raised Baptist. Army Spc. Jeremy Hall, who was raised Baptist but is now an atheist, says the military violated his religious freedom. Like many Christians, he said grace before dinner and read the Bible before bed. Four years ago when he was deployed to Iraq, he packed his Bible so he would feel closer to God. He served two tours of duty in Iraq and has a near perfect record. But somewhere between the tours, something changed. Hall, now 23, said he no longer believes in God, fate, luck or anything supernatural. Hall said he met some atheists who suggested he read the Bible again. After doing so, he said he had so many unanswered questions that he decided to become an atheist. His sudden lack of faith, he said, cost him his military career and put his life at risk. Hall said his life was threatened by other troops and the military assigned a full-time bodyguard to protect him out of fear for his safety.  Watch why Hall says his lack of faith almost got him killed » . In March, Hall filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, among others. In the suit, Hall claims his rights to religious freedom under the First Amendment were violated and suggests that the United States military has become a Christian organization. ""I think it's utterly and totally wrong. Unconstitutional,"" Hall said. Hall said there is a pattern of discrimination against non-Christians in the military. Two years ago on Thanksgiving Day, after refusing to pray at his table, Hall said he was told to go sit somewhere else. In another incident, when he was nearly killed during an attack on his Humvee, he said another soldier asked him, ""Do you believe in Jesus now?"" Hall isn't seeking compensation in his lawsuit -- just the guarantee of religious freedom in the military. Eventually, Hall was sent home early from Iraq and later returned to Fort Riley in Junction City, Kansas, to complete his tour of duty. He also said he missed out on promotions because he is an atheist. ""I was told because I can't put my personal beliefs aside and pray with troops I wouldn't make a good leader,"" Hall said. Michael Weinstein, a retired senior Air Force officer and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, is suing along with Hall. Weinstein said he's been contacted by more than 8,000 members of the military, almost all of them complaining of pressure to embrace evangelical Christianity. ""Our Pentagon, our Pentacostalgon, is refusing to realize that when you put the uniform on, there's only one religious faith: patriotism,"" Weinstein said. Religious discrimination is a violation of the First Amendment and is also against military policy. The Pentagon refused to discuss specifics of Hall's case -- citing the litigation. But Deputy Undersecretary Bill Carr said complaints of evangelizing are ""relatively rare."" He also said the Pentagon is not pushing one faith among troops. ""If an atheist chose to follow their convictions, absolutely that's acceptable,"" said Carr. ""And that's a point of religious accommodation in department policy, one may hold whatever faith, or may hold no faith."" Weinstein said he doesn't buy it and points to a promotional video by a group called Christian Embassy. The video, which shows U.S. generals in uniform, was shot inside the Pentagon. The generals were subsequently reprimanded. Another group, the Officers' Christian Fellowship, has representatives on nearly all military bases worldwide. Its vision, which is spelled out on the organization's Web site, reads, ""A spiritually transformed military, with ambassadors for Christ in uniform empowered by the Holy Spirit."" Weinstein has a different interpretation. ""Their purpose is to have Christian officers exercise Biblical leadership to raise up a godly army,"" he says. But Carr said the military's position is clear. ""Proselytizing or advancing a religious conviction is not what the nation would have us do and it's not what the military does,"" Carr said. The U.S. Justice Department is expected to respond to Hall's lawsuit this week. In the meantime, he continues to work in the military police unit at Fort Riley and plans to leave as soon as his tour of duty expires next year.","Army Spc.

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez have until Friday to respond to a letter from the Major League Baseball Players Association seeking a dismissal of Rodriguez's lawsuit claiming the union did not adequately represent him. The lawsuit stems from Rodriguez's recent 162-game steroid suspension and his efforts to get a Manhattan federal court to throw out the record-setting penalty. The players union, which represented Rodriguez in his arbitration proceeding, claims in the letter that the ""union's forceful advocacy"" was demonstrated by the reduction of his suspension from the 211 games sought by MLB, among other things. In a four-page letter addressed to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, dated Thursday, the union asked the court to throw out the claim against the union because Rodriguez ""does not allege facts sufficient to overturn the [Arbitration] Award"" and failed to provide evidence of a breach of the union's duties in representing him. A spokesman for Rodriguez, Ron Berkowitz, declined to comment Tuesday. In a federal lawsuit filed Jan. 13, Rodriguez accused the players union of acting in ""bad faith"" in representing him during the arbitration process. Rodriguez filed the lawsuit in New York's Southern District court against Major League Baseball and the union in an effort to get back on the field next season. The players union has denied that allegation. A pre-motion conference is set for February 14, and Rodriguez's lawyers were ordered to respond to the union's letter one week before. CNN sought comment from Rodriguez's lawyers but has not received a response. The suspension will not only cost Rodriguez $25 million in salary, but it also further clouds the groundbreaking career of a player who'll turn 40 in the 2015 season. Rodriguez, one of 14 players suspended in the Biogenesis scandal, was the only one who appealed his suspension. Though he was suspended in August, Rodriguez played out the 2013 season because of the appeal. Rodriguez, 38, is fifth on MLB's list of all-time home run leaders, just six homers behind Willie Mays. Rodriguez has claimed he was the target of a MLB ""witch hunt.""","MLB Players Association seeks dismissal of Alex Rodriguez lawsuit .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The world's second Bitcoin ATM is due to land in Hong Kong by the end of this month, according to U.S. based software company Robocoin. The machine, available for sale to individual operators such as banks and private entrepreneurs, allows users to buy or sell Bitcoin in just a few minutes. The process should be much faster than setting up an account on an exchange or via mobile apps and computers which could take a few days for account verification. The advent of Bitcoin ATMs is seen as a step towards bringing the digital currency into the real world. ""It removes all the pain and barriers of entry to buying Bitcoin on an online exchange,"" said Robocoin chief executive Jordan Kelley. ""Our goal as a company is to make the acquisition truly grandma friendly,"" he added. The virtual currency has generated lots of media attention in China where investors have helped drive the price up to dramatic highs above $1,000. ""I think we're going to unleash the power of Bitcoin. It opens a virtual money portal where people can send money to and from,"" said Kelley. This is how it works: . Customers must choose to either buy or sell Bitcoin. Let's say you want to make a withdrawal from your Bitcoin wallet. After choosing an amount of cash you'd like to withdraw, the software installed in the ATM generates a code which you have to scan with your smartphone. Simultaneously, the machine also produces a receipt. Following a confirmation from the Bitcoin network to your phone, you can then scan the code on the receipt at the kiosk, which then prompts the ATM to spit out the allotted amount of cash. The machine is also equipped with a hand scanner that creates a biometric authenticated identity as an anti-money laundering measure. Casper Cheng Tsz Chun, a Hong Kong Bitcoin enthusiast, said the ATM would work a bit like a vending machine ""for buying and selling virtual goods (Bitcoin) instead of physical goods like a can of soda."" Robocoin's first Bitcoin ATM launched in Vancouver in October, and after a month of operation, transactions have totaled 1 million Canadian Dollars ($942,000) in total transactions, according to the company. Kelley said the company has already sold 50 ATMs to other operators worldwide but they are not yet in operation. The company said it chose Hong Kong as the next place to launch its cash machine for the virtual currency because it ""responds well to technological innovation."" Kelley declined to disclose where the ATM would be located. Not every government in Asia is ready for a Bitcoin ATM. Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and Central Bank released a joint statement on their website on Monday stating it does not recognize Bitcoin as an accepted form of currency. The installation of Robocoin Bitcoin ATMs will be prohibited said Tseng Ming-chung, FSC chairman in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency. ""Bitcoin is not real currency and banks cannot receive or provide it. Installing ATMs require the authorization of the FSC, but it will not be approved, thus it is 'impossible' for Bitcoin ATMs to enter or appear in Taiwan,"" Central News Agency reported. The statement also warned institutions against the risk of investing in Bitcoin because of the extremely volatile price. China's central bank issued new rules in December that prohibited financial institutions from dealing in the digital currency. While it did not outlaw individuals from owning Bitcoin, it specifies that it is not to be considered a currency. Despite the setback, Robocoin's chief executive said he still firmly believes China will come to accept Bitcoin. ""Citizens around the world love Bitcoin. The Chinese are very pragmatic in their approach, they just want to make sure they have a very good understanding of the market and the usage,"" he said. Kelley revealed that Robocoin has begun talks with several operators in China that are reaching out to the government and local regulators to ""educate"" them about the value and potential of the Bitcoin market. CNN's Charles Riley contributed to this story.","World's second Bitcoin ATM to open in Hong Kong by the end of January .

"(CNN) -- Count Leopoldo Marcello is being an awfully good sport. He's opened his home to tourists, guided them through its grand halls and pointed out the exquisite frescoes, the work of 18th-century Venetian painter Giambattista Crosato. His visitors, in turn, are forcing him to pose in an antique clerical hat. The relic is one of many possessions on display in the villa. Marcello smiles amicably as his guests snap away. Sequins, silk and lace . Earlier, the count gave me, and a group of 20 like-minded travelers, a tour of his estate -- Ca'Marcello (Via dei Marcello 13, Levada di Piobnino, Italy, +39 049 9350340; apartment rental: $5,427 a week; tours from $7). The space seems entirely too grand to simply house the count and his son, Jacapo. The ballroom is plastered with 18th-century frescoes painted by the one of the most famous Italian artists of that century, Giambattista Tiepelo. Mirrors are framed with eerily placid faces made from stucco. Leopoldo and his son live in the villa, constructed by their ancestors in the 1500s. But in many ways it resembles a museum of bygone riches instead of an actual home. One room features mannequins clad in sequinned, silk and lace gowns that once belonged to the matrons of the Marcello clan. Relics from another era -- including antique century hair pins and opera glasses -- speckle the home. Visitors can explore the surrounding 18th century park and garden; more than 968,000-square-feet of land presided over by an array of statues. If that's not grand enough, you can rent a grand, 3,860-square-foot, four-bedroom apartment located in one of the villa's wings. Those who really want a taste of the aristocratic lifestyle can book private meals with the Marcello family, avail themselves of the cook, or pluck fresh produce from the garden and make their own meal in the private kitchen. And the counts are not only are they willing to wear funny hats, they'll also help arrange travel bookings around the Venetian countryside. Cash-strapped counts . So why is the Marcello family, with a noble history that dates back 2,000 years to the Roman Empire, turning their 400-year old estate into a glorified B&B? The answer is simple: money. ""We're not wealthy enough to live in this place as a home,"" admits Jacopo. ""We need this activity to maintain it. Because of our visitors, we're able to do restorations year by year."" Ca'Marcello is one of nearly 150 villas in Italy's Veneto region -- which includes Venice, Verona, Padua and Vicenza -- to have opened their doors to paying guests. Last year, the group joined forces in a tourist-led cooperative called Villa Veneto. The initiative was founded by Count Alberto Passi de Preposulo, a distinguished aristocrat with a well-trimmed white beard. I met Passi de Preposulo at his home in Treviso, the 16th century Villa Tiepolo Passi (31030 Carbonera, Treviso, Italy, +39 0422 39 77 90; tours from $7, advanced booking required). Clad in a dapper smoking jacket and custom-made loafers, he resembled a rather posh Santa Claus, especially as he was brandishing a jar of homemade quince jelly -- the ingredients sourced from his 3.2 million square feet landscaped garden. He isn't the sort of man you'd imagine renting out his rooms to tourists or selling a place at his dinner table for a paltry â‚¬30 ($40) a head. After all, he too heads up one of Italy's most respected clans -- one which recently celebrated its 1,000-year anniversary and whose family tree can be glimpsed painted on a wall inside the villa. ""Our money is finished,"" he admits, referring not just to himself but to the Veneto region's many landed gentry. Aristocratic barista . I ask Countessa Carolina Valmarana -- the owner of the 17th-century Villa Valmarana (Stradella dei Nani 8, Vicenza, Italy, +39 0444 321 803; apartment rental from $678 per week; tours from $7) -- what would happen if she didn't open her home to lodgers and tours. She admits it'd be a predicament. ""These houses are so expensive to maintain. I actually know a friend that wants to sell it and she can't,"" she says. ""They're very expensive and big and old -- people don't want to buy them because they don't know what to do with them,"" she says. Jacopo admits that if he didn't inherit his stately home, it wouldn't be something he'd invest in. ""I wouldn't buy a place like this nowadays because it's enormous,"" he says. ""The spaces are really grand, and we're just two people living in 9,000 square feet. In that way, it's a strange life, but it is also a unique kind of life."" A few years ago, the countess decided to add a cafe and bar to the heritage status property and even took a degree course to qualify as a barista. For the most part, she seems nonplussed about opening her historic home, which is adorned with baroque frescoes by celebrated father and son duo Gianbattista and Giandomenico Tiepolo. ""We have two apartments that we sometimes rent out to guests, but it's not like we're desperate to rent them; we like to do it. We have nice people that come to stay, people that are into art and love to be here."" Taxing times . So why are members of Italy's aristocracy struggling to afford the upkeep of their grand homes? The counts have a number of theories. Jacopo Marcello says his family's woes started after the Second World War, when nationalization stripped their land assets from 4,000 to 600 acres to support reconstruction and demobbed soldiers. ""Things changed, principles changed,"" he says. ""Now the aristocracy is just part of a big machine and every one of us needs to have a job to have a normal life."" Valmarana says a 2012 end to tax breaks for heritage homes also had a dramatic effect. ""Our taxes have gone up six-fold,"" she laments. ""Though we do get rent, it all goes back into the house."" To ensure their preservation, the countess has to climate control the rooms in her house and complete constant repairs such as fixing a recent ceiling crack. ""The roof wasn't holding the four main doors properly,"" she recalls. Damage can endanger the frescoes, which already expensive to maintain. Passi de Preposulo had a similar issue with a roof collapse at his villa. He insists the money he makes from visitors is not lining his pocket, but goes solely into the upkeep of his estate, which, he points out, isn't merely his home, but an Italian landmark. ""I'm trying to protect this house, and the richness of our history, our roots, but it's expensive,"" he says.","Hard times are forcing Italy's counts and countesses to throw open their doors to tourists .

"(CNN) -- It's a big day at track and field, topped by the always exciting men's 1,500-meter final. In other notable events, several athletes say farewell to the London Games while others look for one more shot at glory. Here are five things to look for Tuesday at the 2012 London Games: . 1. Women's gymnastics floor: Wieber's last chance . Jordyn Wieber of the United States didn't have a chance for an all-around gold, but Tuesday she could medal in her last event of these Games. She takes part in the floor competition, where she scored a 15.000 during the team competition. Her teammate Aly Raisman also has podium hopes and comes into the event having scored the best marks in the event at the London Olympics. Phelps: ""I'm done with swimming"" Event begins at 4:23 p.m. London time (11:23 a.m. ET) 2. Men's 1,500 meters: Could be a Kenyan sweep . Kenyan Asbel Kiprop, who won the 1,000 meters in Beijing at age 19, has run the best time in the world this year, but will be tested by countrymen Silas Kiplagat and Nixon Chebseba. Also keep an eye on Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi, who was reinstated after the governing body of track and field originally had expelled him from the Games for failing to race hard in his 800-meter heat. A doctor's note convinced the IAAF that Makhloufi has a knee injury. From war child to Olympics star . Event begins at 9:15 p.m. London time (4:15 p.m. ET) 3. Men's soccer: Final four time .

"(CNN) -- Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona has been sacked by United Arab Emirates club Al-Wasl after only 14 months in charge. The 1986 World Cup winner arrived in Dubai on a lucrative contract in May 2011, but could only manage to take Al-Wasl to eighth place in the 12-team UAE Pro-League -- which resulted in the club's board resigning. The 51-year-old, who coached Argentina at the 2010 World Cup, was not given the chance to continue his two-year tenure by the new board. ""Following a meeting held by the board of directors of Al Wasl Football Company held today to evaluate the technical staff of Al Wasl Football Team ... it was decided to terminate the services of coach Diego Maradona and his technical staff,"" the club said in a statement on Tuesday. Al-Wasl has won the UAE league title seven times, but not since 2007. Under Maradona, the club won just seven of 22 league games and lost in the quarterfinals of the UAE President's Cup and the final of the Gulf Clubs Champions League. In March, Maradona angrily confronted fans who abused his wife and friends during a match, and Al-Wasl issued an apology which condemned the supporters' actions. Maradona is one of the greatest players in soccer history, having starred for Barcelona and Napoli, but his career was marred by controversy over drug use and he suffered from subsequent health problems.","Diego Maradona sacked by Dubai-based soccer club Al-Wasl .

"(Mashable) -- Streaming music service Songza launched apps for Android and iOS on Tuesday that are designed to make it easy for music fans to find and share digital playlists for practically any occasion. Think of Songza as curated, hand-picked Internet radio. Like Pandora, Songza is not a stream-on-demand service (meaning, you can't request to play a certain track or album). Unlike Pandora, Songza doesn't impose any limitations on how much music you can listen to and it doesn't serve any audio advertisements. Additionally, Songza doesn't focus on creating artist based radio stations -- although you can do that -- instead, it focuses on connecting users with curated or peer-created mix tapes. These playlists are organized around activities (like ""Cocktail Party"" or ""Coding""), genres (""'70s NYC Punk"" or ""Math Rock""), Moods and even Culture. For instance, there is a whole playlist category dedicated to Cover Songs, featuring playlists like ""More Popular Than the Original"" and ""Covering Cash."" The playlists are designed to capture a certain mood, event or activity. Using the free Songza mobile app for iPhone [iTunes link] and Android [Android Market link], users can search and browse through Songza's expertly curated playlists, save their favorites to their phone and share what they are listening to with friends on Facebook and Twitter. The Songza team's previous venture, Amie Street, was acquired by Amazon.com last fall. Songza just closed a financing round led by the same investors that were previously involved in Amie Street. The company clearly has big plans for enhancing its social offerings by allowing users to share their playlists or favorites via social networks. As it stands, Songza sees itself as a ""music concierge"" and a better, smarter way of handling social music discovery. After using the iPhone app over the last 24 hours, we agree. Without a doubt, Songza has the smartest, most well thought out collection of playlists of any of the subscription music services. What we really appreciate is that it is clear that a lot of vetting has gone into creating the officially sanctioned lists. If your friends are on Songza, you can also use the app to follow the playlists they share or like and vice versa. The one downside to Songza and its mobile app is that right now, users can only create playlists at the Songza.com website. Moreover, Songza's licensing restrictions prevent users from listening to the playlists they create themselves. Your friends can listen to your custom mix of ultimate Fall in New York City tunes, but you, the creator can't. Songza's co-founder and CEO Elias Roman told us that the company is looking at either partnering with existing on-demand subscription services such as Spotify or working out its own on-demand licensing agreement so that users can listen to their own selections. If Songza can nail that last loop and provide users who are willing to pay with on-demand access to their own playlists, we could easily see Songza taking off in a huge way. Still, even with the self-playlist limitations, Songza for iPhone and Android is one of the most promising mobile music apps we've seen all year. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Davos (CNN) -- RICHARD QUEST SAYS: The U.S. bank robber Willie Sutton once famously answered the question on why he robbed banks with the reply, ""because that's where the money is."" The same should be said for Davos and the issue of inequality. It may stick in Nina's throat but it is an undeniable truth that it is the people who are attending Davos who can make changes. Frankly, no amount of shouting and protesting will make any difference if those in charge of policy and agendas aren't persuaded by the arguments and decide to do something. And frankly, when it comes to getting all the right people in the same place at the same time, Davos is unique. In Davos during the WEF we have government heads like David Cameron, Shinzo Abe, Tony Abbott and Dilma Rousseff. These are the people who can actually get something done. There is a reason why Pope Francis sent his Cardinal to Davos, and who gave us the quote of the day when he said we must ensure ""humanity is served by wealth and not ruled by it."" This was not a quixotic message ... he knows that if he wants to create the change of greater fairness and equality, those who have power must be on board rather than just bleating about unfairness and hoping someone might listen. This is all about reality rather than fantasy... From the corporate world, there are CEOs here like Muhtar Kent of Coca Cola, Carlos Ghosn of Renault-Nissan, Bob Dudley of BP and Aliko Dangote Africa's richest man. Between them they employ hundreds of thousands of people all across the globe. Their companies set working conditions and wage standards for whole sectors of industry, frequently amongst the low paid. Where they lead others will follow, creating a multiplier effect out of proportion to their individual company. Then there are the extra governmental groups like the International Labour Organization and NGOs like Oxfam International who push these agendas hard. Oxfam International's conclusion that the 85 richest people own half the world's wealth generated huge interest. The director told me Oxfam came to Davos to warn if we don't break out of this power and wealth privilege and opportunity then it ""is dangerous."" Nina, with all the players in the same place, at the same time this is the perfect venue to raise such issues. Of course there is the risk that leaders and CEOs choose to ignore these calls for greater equality. If they do that they will be closing their eyes to the warnings from groups like the WEF itself. In its latest Global Risks report WEF says inequality is now the greatest threat to global stability. ""Income disparity is also among the most worrying of issues. It raises concerns about the Great Recession and the squeezing effect it had on the middle classes in developed economies,"" opines the WEF. Bearing in mind most companies rely on the middle classes in developed countries to sell goods and services throughout the value chain, dealing with inequality is a matter of brutal enlightened self-interest. It's simple economics: Global stability equals global growth equals profits. So -- Nina -- you tell me a better place where you can advise, consult and ultimately warn those with so much at stake of the risks of doing nothing. Or perhaps you would like to stand out in the cold. Talking to yourself. I think I would prefer to talk to those who can actually do something. NINA DOS SANTOS SAYS: From 1,500 meters above sea level you get a great view of the world's big issues. And if you occupy the lofty upper echelons of the ladder -- which many Davos attendees do -- the picture's even clearer right? Wrong. You see, Richard, while you may consider yourself at home among the world's 1%, the very attributes that make a Davos guest so ideal -- power and money -- often clash with some of the subjects those very delegates are here to tackle. That's especially true when it comes to this year's ""theme du jour"": Inequality. Of course getting so many of the world's decision makers in the same room affords its opportunities. But when they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, you have to ask what appetite -- if any -- they would have for change. Also how credible would their views actually be? Take a look at the thorny subject of executive remuneration, which helps feed today's inequality spiral and should keep the corporate crowd on their toes this year. In the UK, for instance, the average blue chip boss can earn up to a staggering 185 times the salary of their ordinary worker. And in the U.S., the chasm looms even wider. I was surprised to hear the CEO of accountancy firm Ernst & Young confess to me on air that he had never investigated the gap between his compensation and that of his more junior staff. ""Should you know this?"" I asked. He protested that he created jobs all around the world. As if that, somehow, makes it okay. Job creation is a valid argument but it doesn't detract from the fact that some Davos attendees are so high up the food chain they are either divorced from reality or willfully blind to what doesn't affect them. Until it costs them money or votes, which is why, as you point out Richard, the ""squeezed middle"" has made its way up the agenda, arguably decades too late. Pope Francis' decision to send a papal envoy to Davos was a game changer this year. But his message -- read out by Cardinal Turkson -- wasn't just about lobbying those in power, it was also about making sure those suffering hardship and financial strain are also represented among the World Economic Forum elites. You see recessions and recovery have a habit of treating the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" differently. And while those further down an organization are more likely to face the ax when times are lean, they don't benefit as much as their bosses when business is better. But don't take my word for it, Richard. Let the figures speak for themselves. Oxfam's report about the top 85 fortunes having a stranglehold over the world's riches has certainly captured public attention but the trend was already well known. A few years ago Branko Milanovic of the World Bank estimated that between 1988 and 2008, around the world, the highest earners saw their income rise by 60% while the lowest 5% haven't witnessed any uptick at all. And that's just income. Don't get me started on the wealth gap, where inheritances, better access to capital and contacts amplify the trend. Richard, you say you would prefer to talk to ""those who matter"" but I caution you, one can learn a lot from the 99% who actually staff their firms and fund their government's trips to Davos. They do the doing rather than the talking. And guess what? They count just as much. Global economic recovery feeds growing inequality .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian starlet Neymar completed his transfer to Barcelona on Monday and swiftly declared that his aim was to help Lionel Messi continue to be the best footballer on the planet. ""Barca are more than a club and a great team and I want to help Messi to continue to be the greatest player in the world,"" he was quoted as saying by Barcelona's official website. The words may be seen as an attempt to dampen speculation as to how the 21-year-old signing from Brazilian side Santos will fare alongside the four-time World Footballer of the Year. Barcelona legend Johann Cruyff recently stoked the debate when stressing a need to learn from the past as he discussed Neymar's arrival, saying he would not put ""two captains on the same ship."" Despite his widespread reputation as one of the greatest players in footballing history, Messi has not been averse to criticism from some teammates in years gone by. In his 2011 biography, Zlatan Ibrahimovic complained that the end of his Barcelona career began when Messi told then coach Pep Guardiola that he wanted to play centrally, rather than on the wing, so forcing the Swede to play out of position. The striker was an expensive flop after joining in 2009 and the present Barcelona hierarchy will hope that the $75 million spent on Neymar will work out far better than the similar amount splashed on Ibrahimovic, who lasted just a year at the club. ""There are big question marks as to how Neymar will fit into the team as there is already one god, or demigod, at Barcelona in Lionel Messi,"" Spanish football expert Jimmy Burns told CNN. ""There is potential tension. Cruyff has said in recent days that you cannot have two captains but other people are being more generous. ""I think he is going to introduce a necessary element of dynamism to a Barca that showed signs of flagging in the season just past, and who were utterly destroyed by Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals."" Beaten 7-0 over two legs in the semifinals of this year's competition by the eventual winners, Barcelona can at least reflect on a more than satisfactory league campaign. They reclaimed the title off last year's champions Real Madrid in convincing fashion, winning La Liga by a record 15 points over their bitter rivals. Barca also registered 32 victories and reached 100 points for the first time in a league campaign following Saturday's 4-1 defeat of Malaga. ""I'm very happy to be a Barca player. I'm very excited, I've realized a dream. Thank you so much,"" said Neymar after walking out into Barcelona's stadium accompanied by a group of children and the club's hymn. ""It is an honor to play alongside the best player in the world in Messi. It should be easier to play alongside him because he is the best,"" he added later. He was greeted by over 56,000 fans, with the Barcelona website commenting that ""very few players (had) garnered this much attention from the Camp Nou faithful."" The Brazil international, who flew overnight from Rio de Janeiro after playing in Sunday's 2-2 draw with England, put pen to paper on his contract on Monday after passing a medical. Neymar -- whose full name is Neymar da Silva Junio -- signed a deal that is set to keep him at the club until 2018. Any suitors potentially interested in luring the Brazilian away will have to stump up a staggering transfer fee after Barcelona announced that his buyout clause is $248 million. Barcelona vice president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed on Monday that Barca had planned to bring in Neymar next year only to have to move the deal forward in light of competition for his signature from Real Madrid and another unnamed club. ""The operation has been made more expensive due to the interest of other clubs that interfered in the signing of Neymar,"" he said. ""It was foreseen that Neymar would arrive in 2014. To bring the move forward, we have had to pay $22 million more."" In total, the deal cost Barcelona $75 million, with the club having already made a down payment of $13 million last year. Neymar himself said he had always targeted a move to Barcelona despite the attempts made by their great rivals Real. ""Real Madrid is a great club and I respect them, but I chose Barca because my heart was with Barca and I am here today,"" he explained. ""My family and I have never been moved by money, for me happiness is very important and I am happy at Barca."" The Spanish titleholders and four-time European champions announced the signing of the forward on May 26.","Neymar signs five-year contract at Barcelona before greeting packed Camp Nou .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korean rockets blasting across the sky. Soldiers marching in high-step unison in Pyongyang parades. Broadcasts praising leader Kim Jong Un while putting down the United States as the country's mortal enemy. These images of North Korea from state media portray a proud, strong and self-reliant country. But behind the propaganda and beyond the capital of Pyongyang is the harsher reality of poverty, hunger and desperation, defectors say. ""My family had decided to commit suicide because for three days we didn't have anything to eat,"" said one North Korean female defector to ITN in Seoul. ""We decided to starve to death. We said let's die. But then I wanted to survive. I sold the house for 30 kilos of rice."" She escaped North Korea shortly after leader Kim Jong Un came to power last year -- her identity kept secret because she left family behind. ""To survive, I had to eat grass. People pick grass and leaves and use them to make soup,"" said the defector who now lives in South Korea. Reports out of North Korea suggest food prices have tripled in the past year. More than 25% of North Korean children under the age of five suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2012, according to the National Nutrition Survey of North Korea, a report backed by UNICEF, the World Food Program and the World Health Organization. The report also found nearly one in three women suffered from anemia. As many as 3.5 million people are estimated to have died during North Korea's severe famine of the 1990s, according to South Korean NGO Good Friends Center for Peace, Human Rights, and Refugees. Official North Korean numbers estimate 220,000 people died. ""One thing that struck me is just how empty this land looks. I'm told that only about 20% of North Korea is arable,"" said CNN's Stan Grant on a reporting trip to North Korea in April 2012. ""And the people move so slowly out here. Sometimes you see someone ambling across a field carrying a hoe or holding a shovel. Other times you see children wandering by the side of the road.

Outside the capital, the poverty of the nation becomes palpable, says a tour operator who regularly leads groups into North Korea. ""The further you go from Pyongyang, people's clothes get more simple. The people themselves are smaller,"" said Simon Cockerell of Beijing-based Koryo Tours. ""Like for any developing country, the capital city is the best place to be. Wages are higher and people tend to be better off,"" he said. ""But then we go out to second-tier cities -- Chongjin and Hamhung, North Korea's second and third biggest cities -- and it's clearly much drabber than Pyongyang."" Cockerell, who has been leading tour groups across North Korea for the past 11 years, also puts down the idea that everyone they meet is an actor. ""The frequency of the general public to say hello is increasing but still there isn't that much interaction. Communication does happen with younger people who have English fluency, older people or people who have been drinking,"" he added. ""Quite often when you go to a park, people might come over and say hello. The degree of welcome is remarkable and it's the sort of thing that people don't expect.

"(CNN) -- Modern travel is an intensely visual experience. We feast our eyes on glossy guidebooks before bombarding Facebook and Instagram with our oh-so stylish shots of footprints on empty beaches, stunning sunsets and that weird thing we found in the pool. But in our efforts to soak up the sights and stuff our hard drives with selfies, we may be neglecting another vital element of the travel experience -- sound. That's the worry of Trevor Cox, a British acoustic engineer who, armed with a microphone and digital recorder, has spent several years earwigging his way around the planet in search of what he calls its ""sonic wonders."" ""We're used to going on our travels and looking out for beautiful vistas and wonderful architecture, but we tend not to think about the sound,"" says Cox, who was struck by the notion of exploring a wider world of sound while investigating echoes in, of all places, a London sewer. ""So then I began to think about where I would go if you wanted listen to the most remarkable sounds in the world and I was surprised to find there was relatively little information,"" he tells CNN. ""That's when I thought I should gather it myself."" More: Big thrills -- 50 ways to be a daredevil . Cox has documented his adventures in audio in the newly published ""The Sound Book"" (released as ""Sonic Wonderland"" in the UK) -- a fascinating journey which, over several years, takes him from scorching desert sands to slimy subterranean chambers. He also runs a website aimed at encouraging others to explore sonic wonders and engage in ""sound tourism,"" and points out that since most travelers carry cell phones, they're already equipped with powerful recording devices. ""It's all about making yourself aware and thinking as you wander around about what you are going to catch -- but all you really need to do is listen."" It's about time to make some noise about sound tourism. With the aid of Cox, we've compiled a list of the world's best sonic destinations. Singing sands (California) Where: Kelso Dunes in California's Mojave Desert . What: When in contact with sliding humans, peculiarities in the sand produce deep parping sounds resembling propeller aircraft or sousaphone accidents. Cox says: ""This one was always high on my bucket list. You need the right sort of dune with the right size sand grains. When you scoot down on your backside you get this weird droning."" Stay: Hotel Nipton. Rustic but charming establishment that offers rooms with shared bathrooms and eco-lodges. 107355 Nipton Road, Nipton; +1 760 856 2335 . Hear the sands . Bearded singing seals (Norway) Where: Svalbard, a bleak Norwegian archipelago of ice-capped mountains and fierce polar bears way out in the Arctic Ocean . What: Mind-bending, sub-aquatic sci-fi effects produced by hairy-faced sea mammals to woo their mates -- a soundscape worryingly similar to the tinnitus hangover of a Motorhead gig. Cox says: ""They don't really sound like animals, they sound like UFOs coming in to land -- they make this extraordinary noise that lasts about a minute."" Stay: Polar Hotel. Efficient chain hotel with spectacular fjord views and even more spectacular prices (this is Norway). Longyearbyen 9171, Spitsbergen; +47 79 02 34 50 . Hear the seals . Chirping Mayan pyramid (Mexico) Where: Temple of Kukulcan, Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Mexico . What: Clap your hands in front of this 1,100-year-old structure and you'll hear an echo not unlike the sacred quetzal bird. Only disturbing if you've seen the 2008 film ""The Ruins,"" in which sound-mimicking vines devour feckless tourists atop a Mayan pyramid. Cox says: In his book, Cox asks whether the echo was a Mayan design reflecting sophisticated acoustic knowledge: ""Imagine an ancient Mayan priest presiding over a ceremony and, with great theatricality, summoning the sound of the quetzal bird by clapping his hands."" Stay: If you want to avoid staying with the crowds in Chichen Itza, the Yucatan's culturally lively capital of Merida is just down the road. The Villa Merida is a tranquil converted colonial mansion set around an airy courtyard. Merida-Uman, Merida; +52 999 928-8466 . Hear the pyramid . Gong rocks (Tanzania) Where: Moru Kopjes, Serengeti National Nark, Tanzania -- and other sites across Africa . What: Not a prog rock group, but one of several eons-old boulders that produce mellow notes when whacked with smaller stones. Tonally, their range can be a bit on the monotonous side, but the fact that it probably resonates back to the dawn of civilization helps raise neck hairs. Cox says: ""Among the earliest evidence we have of what our ancestors might have listened to is left over bits of musical instruments like these rock gongs."" Stay: You'll need pockets big enough to hold a gong rock to afford to stay in the swanky safari camps of the southern serengeti. Asanja Africa (+255 78 822 1440) is typically luxurious. Hear the rocks . Whispering gallery (India) Where: Gol Gumbaz mausoleum, in Bijapur, a town in southwestern India's Karnataka state . What: This majestic, rose-domed structure built in the 1600s features one of the best examples of a whispering gallery -- an elevated architectural echo chamber that seems to sample human voices and loop them repetitively in the style of a 1960s horror flick. Hugely entertaining. Cox says: In ""The Sound Book,"" Cox writes: ""With children enjoying yelling and listening as their voices repeat over and over again, the atmosphere is like a crowded day at the swimming pool."" Stay: Humdrum hotels abound in Bijapur, but head south and you'll find Badami. The Krishna Heritage looks like a retirement village but pulls in good reviews. Ramdurg Road, Badami; +91 99 01 91 21 27 . Hear the gallery . Bubbling mud pots (Iceland) Where: Hverir, Namafjall, northern Iceland . What: A sulfurous volcanic landscape where noxious gas belches forth from roiling cauldrons of primordial gunge with the fury of a waterfall. Cox says: ""Tumultuous pools of battleship-gray mud bubble at a low simmer,"" Cox writes in his book. ""They seem almost alive; some belch like a thick, gloppy lentil soup while others rage and splatter like an unappetizing gruel on a fast boil."" Stay: Cape Hotel (Laugarbrekka 16, 640 HusavÃ­k; +354 463 3399) is in the tiny fishing town of Husavik. Here you can also pay a visit local museums dedicated to Icelandic history, whales and, of course, penises. Hear the mud pots . World's longest reverberations (Scotland) Where: Inchindown oil storage complex/Glasgow's Hamilton mausoleum -- Scotland . What: Cox crawled down slippery pipes to access a vast, empty World War II oil tank built into a Scottish hillside near the town of Invergordon to measure the reverberations within. Using a starting gun (and a saxophone), he pegged them at a record-breaking 75 seconds. Sadly, since Inchindown is rarely open to the public, sonic tourists will have to make do with a trip to the previous Guinness record holder, also in Scotland. The grand Hamilton Mausoleum, just outside Glasgow, clocks in at 15 seconds. Stay: Classy B&B action at 15 Glasgow, in the middle of Scotland's vibrant second city. 15 Woodside Place, Glasgow; +44 141 332 12 63 . Hear the Inchindown oil tank echo . Musical road (California) Where: Avenue G, Lancaster, California . What: A series of grooves gouged into the pavement renders a stretch of the westbound roadway into an instrument that plays the ""William Tell Overture"" -- also known as the ""Lone Ranger"" theme -- when vehicles drive over it. The rhythm is recognizable, but the tune sounds like someone gargling with water in an adjacent room. Cox says: ""It is a very bad rendition of the 'William Tell Overture' -- but it makes you laugh."" Stay: Overnight stays are only for fans of underwhelming chain hotels or tired motels. Keep driving and you'll hit California's I-5 highway for a drive north for stellar scenery and, you never know, some amazing sounds.

"(CNN) -- Washington needs to be reformed. With polls consistently showing that Americans distrust their government and an abundance of evidence that our political system is not working well (some polls have shown that legislators are less trusted than car salesmen), the urgency of improving the rules and procedures through which our politicians govern is essential. It is a good time to look back at the Watergate Babies, most of whom have left town. Over the past month, two of the giants from this class, California Reps. George Miller and Henry Waxman have announced that they will retire. Almost the entire class is gone, other than Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Minnesota Democrat Rick Nolan. The class of Democrats elected in 1974 in the aftermath of President Richard Nixon's resignation amidst the Watergate scandal believed that to achieve better policies, legislators needed to clean up the political process. Nixon had been brought down from power as a result of evidence that he had covered up the investigation into whether White House officials had been involved in a burglary at the Democratic campaign headquarters in the Watergate complex. The new Democrats were younger than their predecessors, many had been elected in Republican districts where voters were furious with Nixon and many wanted to move beyond the traditional policy orthodoxies that had defined Democrats since the New Deal. Unlike so many politicians who keep their eyes focused almost exclusively on what bills they want to pass and accept the political system for what it is, the 75 Watergate Babies insisted government reform needed to be at the top of the agenda. They didn't just complain about government, they took steps to make it work better. This was the only way to correct what had gone wrong in the early 1970s. ""There is a mood of reform in the air on Capitol Hill,"" noted Common Cause when the freshmen arrived. When the freshman class arrived to Washington, they refused to go along with the status quo. One of their biggest steps was to demand that several senior committee chairmen, who were used to having everyone defer to them, answer questions about whether they would be responsive to the interests of the Democratic Caucus. When a few of them refused, the freshmen led the caucus in stripping them of their power. Edward Hebert, the crusty old chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, insulted the freshmen by calling them ""boys and girls"" in front of reporters. In doing so, he sealed his fate. One legislator said that the chairman had ""underestimated the intelligence of the people he was talking to. We may be new kids on the block, but we're not stupid."" The Washington Post concluded, ""a revolution has occurred. The seniority system as the rigid, inviolable operating framework of the House has been destroyed."" The Watergate Babies also led the way in instituting changes in rules and regulations. Working in an alliance with liberal Democrats who had been in office since the late 1950s, their sunshine laws opened up much more of the legislative process to public and media scrutiny. They instituted ethics reforms that created new standards of accountability for politicians in the executive and legislative branches. They ensured that the new campaign finance laws required disclosure of information about who gave money to whom, and that the Federal Election Commission was capable of monitoring the laws. They reformed the filibuster rules to lower the number of senators required to end a filibuster, from two-thirds to three-fifths of the Senate, while providing party leaders more tools so that they could keep members in line (back then reformers wanted more partisanship, not less). Over time, the Watergate Babies lost much of their zeal for government reform. This class of Democrats eventually focused their attention on policy issues, becoming less interested in cleaning up the political process. Waxman was a pioneer on issues such as the environment and health care, while Miller was a legislative giant who fought for programs like the minimum wage while others like Colorado's Gary Hart emphasized public investment in high tech industries and new approaches to defense. Some of the reforms also didn't work out as they intended. But the original focus of the Watergate Babies is an important legacy and one that we should not forget. Their central argument that major policy innovations are impossible unless we make the political system better is one that would be worth remembering. Although President Barack Obama made political reform part of his 2008 campaign promises, the issues faded quickly from his agenda. Nor have the tea party Republicans, who love to rail against the way that Washington works, really devoted much time to questions such as campaign finance. Rather, their emphasis has been about cutting the government down in size. Today, reform is urgent. We badly need campaign finance rules that impose limits on what independent organizations can spend and lobbying reforms that seriously close the revolving door between Capitol Hill and the K Street lobbying complex. Without procedural reforms to weaken the power of party leaders, heightened partisanship in the House and Senate won't subside. Without rules to change the budgeting process, the ability of our Congress to make decisions about spending and taxation in a more rational process -- one that does not constantly risk default -- will be extraordinarily difficult as well. Without reforms that make sure continued bastions of secrecy, such as conference committees, open up their doors, there will be ongoing frustration with a lack of accountability in politics. As Waxman and Miller step down, it is time to celebrate what they represented in their heyday during the 1970s. Politicians need to devote some of their capital to strengthening the processes of decision-making and governing. That's vital to restoring trust in government. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: The last few reformers elected after Watergate are retiring .

"Le Bourget, France (CNN) -- Is it a plane? Is it a drone? Next time you look up and see vapor trails spreading across the sky, bear in mind that the aircraft you're looking at might just be both. As the aviation industry tightens its belt, its attempts to save money and stay relevant have led to a new rise of ""transformers"" -- including crop-dusters and business jets given a new lease of life as surveillance aircraft. With the financial crisis continuing to bite -- not least in the U.S. defense sector -- more and more aircraft manufacturers are trying to secure their future by turning older aviation staples into innovative new ones, creating a new breed of ""transformers."" In a former life, Piaggio Aero's HammerHead was a business jet (the Avanti II), used to ferry well-to-do travelers to and from high-powered meetings or red carpet events. Today the twin-engine turboprop is being turned into a drone, with surveillance equipment and remote flying systems replacing the nine passengers and pilot. Unveiling the new-look aircraft at last week's Paris Airshow, Piaggio Aero's CEO Alberto Galassi said the HammerHead -- which the company expects to be approved for use by 2014 -- offered ""an insight into what an advanced UAS [Unmanned Aerial System] of the future will look like."" Iomax's ArchAngel, also on display at Le Bourget is, the company says, a border patrol aircraft designed to provide ""airborne surveillance for intelligence and security."" But in its slightly more down-to-earth pre-modification past, the aircraft was originally conceived as the Thrush, an agricultural crop-duster. Also joining the hybrid ranks at the Paris Airshow was Centaur, the plane that thinks it is a drone. Or is that be the other way around? The aircraft, designed for surveillance missions, can be flown remotely as a UAV by a ground-based operator, or in the traditional way with a pilot at the controls. Its creators, U.S.-based Aurora Flight Services, say it takes Centaur's two-man crew just four hours to switch the plane from one mode of flying to the other. Bill Sweetman, international defense editor of Aviation Week, said the trend for turning existing aircraft into others, rather than creating them from scratch, was down to two main reasons: the financial crisis, and the end of the Cold War. Both mean that completely new aircraft are not being designed as often as they have done in the past. ""Instead companies are modernizing, adapting aircraft they've already got to allow them to do something different, because the industry's needs now are very different to what they were during the Cold War, and they will be something different again in the next 10 years or so,"" he told CNN. ""It is proving very hard to get the FAA to approve a simpler, cheaper aircraft designed from the start to be unmanned,"" said Graham Warwick, Aviation Week's technology editor. ""Instead it is easier to take an aircraft that the FAA has already certificated for manned flight, and take the pilot out of it,"" he said. ""If a company takes an existing aircraft -- which they know flies, works, is safe and reliable -- and converts that into an unmanned vehicle, that allows them to develop it much more quickly,"" said Sweetman. And then there's Project Zero, an entirely different sort of ""transformer."" This super-futuristic looking electric-powered aircraft is formed of a graceful aerodynamic swoosh of carbon fibre enclosing a cockpit (like the drones above, it has so far only been flown unmanned) and two massive rotor blades. It is these rotor blades which are the secret to the aircraft's groundbreaking nature. Facing the ground, they allow Project Zero to take off vertically, like a helicopter. But once in the air, the rotors can be tilted, enabling it to fly forwards like a traditional plane. Project Zero, which has been in the works -- but firmly under wraps -- for several years, was unveiled at this week's Paris Air Show. James Wang, Agusta Westland's vice president of research and technology, who oversaw work on the aircraft, said it was designed ""to be as radical as possible,"" reflecting the motto of the advanced project group behind it: ""'Live to Dream' - if it can be dreamed, it can be built."" Just how high and how fast the aircraft is capable of flying is still a closely-guarded secret, but Wang insists ""it works, we have flown this thing."" There's just one catch though -- despite being proven to work in flight tests, Project Zero is not likely to go into production any time soon. Instead it is intended as a ""technology incubator,"" a way of trialing and showcasing all the latest innovations at once. Still, the company hopes that even if we're not going to be flying a Project Zero within the next 10 years, some of the technology it has helped develop will become the norm on more everyday aircraft. ""Project Zero might or might not make the basis for a future UAV or form of transport, but it's the parts in there that are important, that have potential,"" says Sweetman. And that could help to transform the whole industry, not just one aircraft.","Aviation manufacturers are turning older aircraft into drones .

"London (CNN) -- It may not be the prettiest, but the world's smallest, cheapest personal computer is inspiring a wave of delightful DIY innovation among tech hobbyists across the planet. With a price tag of just $25, the unassuming Raspberry Pi is an easily-programmable, open-source single board computer, about the size of a credit card, whose cost, size and low power requirements make it ideally suited for backyard inventors. Described by its creator, University of Cambridge professor Eben Upton as ""an attempt to try and reboot some of that 1980s computer industry feel,"" the technology has been embraced by creative hackers worldwide and put to use in home weather stations to hot air balloon tracking and camera systems. The RPi has been shortlisted in London's Design Museum ""Designs of the Year"" awards, with judges citing its affordability, power and accessibility to children. As part of the exhibition accompanying the prizes, examples of creative uses of RPi are on display at the museum until July 7. They include a stylish, personalized train departure board created by Gareth James of Hove, UK, which provides the times of the next trains to Brighton. ""It's great to have a dedicated piece of connected hardware that looks nice and sits and waits to be useful,"" he said. ""Whenever I'm thinking of leaving the house I can easily check the next train time. Plus, it looks good on the wall... No longer do I end up hanging around on the cold train platform."" Read/Watch: Why everyone wants a slice of Raspberry Pi . Alyssa Dayan and Tom Hartley created AirPi, an air quality and weather surveillance station that uses RPi to take readings from an array of sensors, translating the data into meaningful information and uploading it on to the internet. The project cost only Â£55 on top of the cost of the RPi. Dayan said the team had designed the device and set up a website ""not only to take our own air quality and weather readings but to encourage and teach others to do the same -- and hopefully eventually create a network of measurements coming in from across the world."" She said one of the key benefits of RPi was the ease with which components could be added to the board, which, combined with its cost, made it a great entry point to introduce children to electronics. ""I think the user-friendliness of computers has gotten to the extent that far too many people simply have no idea what goes on inside them,"" she said. ""Inventions like the Raspberry Pi really help to change that."" A team from PA Consulting Group created a private cell phone network by connecting the RPi to a radio interface. ""We've shrunk a 30-foot base station into a three-inch Raspberry Pi and created our own mobile phone network,"" said PA's Frazer Bennett. ""This proves what can be achieved through low-cost off the shelf-systems."" Read/Watch: Demystifying cloud threats and firewalls . In a more playful spirit, Tom Rees created a car out of Lego that is controlled using the console from a gaming system. ""It is easier than ever (and less scary than ever) to have your computer control your house, move a robotic arm, turn a wheel, read the temperature, or speak your weight,"" he said. ""The sky is the limit."" High-altitude ballooning enthusiast David Akerman can attest to that. He's using RPi to track and transmit photographs from his unmanned balloon flights, which have ascended 40.5 kilometers (25.2 miles) into near space with a camera. ""The Pi has plenty of memory and processor power, meaning that it can take several photographs and then send the best image to transmit,"" he said. ""Balloon payloads swing and rotate a lot and many of the images will be directly at the sun or the black sky, and my software rejects all of those."" Akerman, whose RPi invention isn't included in the design Museum exhibition, is tinkering on improvements that will allow him to send better and larger images from the flight, and is optimistic of besting his highest altitude on the next flight. ""I'm hoping to fly this in the next few weeks,"" he said.","Raspberry Pi s an easily-programmable, open-source computer that sells for $25 .

"(CNN) -- Air New Zealand's latest in-flight safety video, released Tuesday, is already another viral hit but is encountering some turbulence over its use of several bikini-clad Sports Illustrated models. View the video here . Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling ""the world's most beautiful safety video."" The ""Safety in Paradise"" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. ""It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,"" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. ""No no no no no! What a giant step backwards for the representation of women by NZ,"" commented Facebook user Claire Jongenelen on Air New Zealand's official page. ""I am so embarrassed and disappointed, as a young NZ woman who travels for business and leisure with Air NZ. This isn't the beauty of the Cook Islands. The beauty of the Cook Islands is the scenery and its (truly) beautiful inhabitants. I'm actually a little disgusted."" (We've posted several comments from social media at the base of this story) Air New Zealand spokesperson Andrew Aitken refuted those comments. ""We have been careful to ensure 'Safety in Paradise' has been produced in a way that is tasteful,"" he said. The carrier, taking fun seriously, quickly established a reputation for edgy safety videos -- part of the company strategy, Air New Zealand CEO Christopher Luxon told CNN. ""We know that we actually get our customers watching and interpreting and internalizing our safety messages, better than I would argue anyone else, because we get their attention with the video ... We've had 12 million people watch our Hobbit safety video on YouTube and you sit there and go, that's quite an incredible thing. But it's another small example of just how we think that we can deliver the table stakes of a great airline but actually do it with a twist and with some personality along the way,"" Luxon told CNN in an interview recorded late January for CNN's business feature series, Executive Innovator. That interview was conducted before the safety video was released. ""We'll have inflight safety videos that people love or people hate. But at the end of the day it's about taking risk and embracing risk intelligently. And that's what we've trying to do across the whole of the business as a result."" Previous safety video ""episodes"" include ""Safety Old School Style,"" featuring Betty White and other octogenarians, ""The Bear Essential of Safety,"" with Bear Grylls and ""Mile High Madness with Richard Simmons,"" in which a sequin-shirted, short-shorted Simmons gaily encourages passengers to ""grab, click and pull!"" The latter has racked up nearly 3 million views on YouTube. The latest ""Safety in Paradise: video includes: . - Ariel Meredith checking herself in a mirror having donned her oxygen mask. - Local men sneaking a look at a pouting, frolicking Jessica Gomes while demonstrating how to ""brace."" - A three-second glimpse of a muscly male pool cleaner (seemingly in case the ladies were feeling neglected). The ""making of"" video already has 540,000 views on YouTube, while the ""Safety in Paradies"" video, released Tuesday, has more than 120,000 at the time of writing.

"(CNN) -- Outgoing ""Tonight Show"" host Jay Leno congratulated his replacement Jimmy Fallon at the start of his opening monologue on Wednesday night, while taking another swipe at the NBC executives that are showing him the door. ""I just have one request of Jimmy. We've all fought, kicked and scratched to get this network up to fifth place, okay? Now we have to keep it there."" he deadpanned. ""Jimmy don't let it slip into sixth. We're counting on you."" Leno will wrap up his 22-year run as host in spring 2014, with Jimmy Fallon officially signing on as his replacement. According to a statement from NBC, ""As part of the transition, 'The Tonight Show' will be returning to its original home in 30 Rock in New York"" from Leno's base of Los Angeles. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo praised the move, saying in a statement ""on behalf of all New Yorkers"" that he's ""pleased to welcome 'The Tonight Show' back to its first home."" When it began in 1954, the ""original 'Tonight Show' ushered in the modern era of television,"" Cuomo continued. ""It is only fitting that as 'The Tonight Show' returns to our state, it will be headlined by New York's own native son and resident, Jimmy Fallon."" Opinion: How Twitter helped Fallon get Leno's job . The expectation that Leno would leave NBC's legendary late-night program has been building recently, and Fallon's appointment isn't surprising in the least. He's had a swift rise to ""Tonight's"" chair, having hosted ""Late Night"" for just four years, but Fallon's transition was treated as such a near certainty that both hosts worked the headlines into their nightly routines. While Fallon initially downplayed the rumors, Leno went after his employer on a regular basis. He's compared NBC executives to snakes, joked about the network's sagging ratings and kidded that the rumored late-night shuffle was like NBC's version of March Madness. Just two days before the big announcement, Fallon and Leno again made light of the reports with a parody of the song ""Tonight"" from the musical ""West Side Story."" With Leno's contract set to expire in fall 2014, industry observers said the move was only a matter of time. Leno first exited ""Tonight"" in 2009 after 17 years as host, passing the torch to Conan O'Brien, who was then the host of ""Late Night."" Leno was moved to prime time with his own program, ""The Jay Leno Show,"" in the fall of 2009. But when that brought dismal ratings, NBC decided to put Leno back in charge of ""Tonight"" at the start of 2010, leaving O'Brien without a job. The flame-haired comedian eventually moved to TBS to host his own show, ""Conan,"" in the 11 p.m. hour, but the entire scenario generated ill will toward Leno and NBC. (TBS shares a parent company with CNN.) Yet as the years went on, Leno has proved to be resilient. As NBC's prime-time ratings suffered, Leno's ""Tonight Show"" was still able to rise above the rest in its time slot. At the end of March, ""The Tonight Show"" hit a seven-week high in total viewers, with 3.52 million watching. However, NBC was said to be concerned about losing younger viewers to ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, whose ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" was moved up to compete with Leno and David Letterman's ""Late Show"" at the beginning of 2013. ""The more time Jimmy Kimmel is in that slot, the more the young audience goes that way, the harder it is for (Fallon) to keep that audience,"" one source familiar with the network's thought process told The Hollywood Reporter in March. At 62 years old, Leno represents a more traditional form of hosting, as he's known for his ""Las Vegas-style comedy,"" said the New York Times. Fallon, 38, regularly incorporates the Web and social media into his act, offering ""a more contemporary and varied brand of entertainment,"" the Times said. This changing of the guard is one of the most closely watched exercises in pop culture, especially as it takes place at one of TV's mainstay productions. Even with its decline in ratings over the years, it remains a solid profit center for NBC, making between $25 million and $40 million for the network, according to The New York Times. Although it's been on the air for almost 60 years, ""The Tonight Show"" has had just a handful of regular hosts: Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Leno and O'Brien.

"(CNN) -- The horrific events in Newtown are unfathomable. Asking ""why?"" is natural at times like this, but intuitively it is clear that there cannot be any good reason for what was truly a senseless massacre. It is impossible not to grieve with the families in Newtown, Connecticut, who have experienced such tremendous loss, just as it is impossible to not hope for anything that can provide some comfort. All of us who have had children in primary school at one time or another stopped in our tracks when we heard the news, just as President Barack Obama did, as we tried to imagine how we would have coped had something so horrendous happened in our own child's school. But why must the nation grieve with God? After Newtown, a memorial service was held in which 10 clergy and Obama offered Hebrew, Christian and Muslim prayers, with the president stating: "" 'Let the little children come to me,' Jesus said, 'and do not hinder them. For such belongs to the kingdom of Heaven.' God has called them all home. For those of us who remain, let us find the strength to carry on."" Why must it be a natural expectation that any such national tragedy will be accompanied by prayers, including from the president, to at least one version of the very God, who apparently in his infinite wisdom, decided to call 20 children between the age of 6 and 7 home by having them slaughtered by a deranged gunman in a school that one hopes should have been a place of nourishment, warmth and growth? We are told the Lord works in mysterious ways but, for many people, to suggest there might be an intelligent deity who could rationally act in such a fashion and that that deity is worth praying to and thanking for ""calling them home"" seems beyond the pale. Let me be clear that there may be many grieving families in Newtown and around the country who have turned to their faith for solace in this difficult time. No caring person would begrudge them this right to ease their pain. But the question that needs to be asked is why, as a nation, do we have to institutionalize the notion that religion must play a central role at such times, with the president as the clergyman-in-chief? Since this tragedy, cable TV networks have been flooded with calls to faith and have turned to numerous clergy as if, as a matter of principle, they have something special or caring to offer. Often what they provide is quite the opposite. On CNN the other day, Bishop Robert Wright of the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta suggested that people who don't have faith in his deity can only go so far in our emotional capacities to love and forgive, that without faith ""we lack the strength to take us the full way of ourselves, the best of ourselves."" Besides being offensive, this is nonsense. We don't need faith to empathize with the grieving in Newtown. We can feel real connections, whether we are parents, or neighbors of families, or simply caring men and women. And we can want to help simply because of our common humanity. Why does television automatically turn to clergy for advice on how to meet our needs, spiritual or otherwise? Later on television, I saw media Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, who used to claim to be the personal spiritual guide of Michael Jackson, until that presumably became less sellable. I also once had the displeasure of debating him on the subject of evolution, which he essentially rejects, offering admonition to those who, with very good reason, may question a God who could willingly allow the slaughter of children. I would argue that times like these are very good times to question your faith in deities. It gets worse. Television host and former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee suggested that because we are keeping God out of schools, the Deity chose not to stop the slaughter of these young innocents. (Or, to put it more bluntly, ""If you don't invite me to the party, I will kill your kids!"") If this were remotely believable, who would want to pray to such a fickle and pompous deity? I feel particularly sad for the grieving parents who might not be Christian, Jewish or Muslim. Besides learning that they are somehow lacking in empathy or goodness or the ability to heal, little guidance is being provided to those who among them have decided that they cannot believe in a sometimes violent and irascible God or who in fact have found their faith in God in question as a result of this tragedy. For these people, as for me, the thought that God has ""called their children home"" is simply offensive. Why can't we as a nation focus on consoling the families in their grief by focusing on the most important realities, the lives of the children they have lost, celebrating their memory and sharing our common love of family, of children, and of our common humanity and perhaps most importantly arguing that this tragedy may one day not be completely in vain: That a shocked nation might rationally decide that assault weapons are meant to kill many people in a short time, not to hunt for deer or defend one's home. If instead of automatically assuming that prayers to a deity callous enough to allow this sickness, or worse, to encourage it out of divine retribution, are what families in grief need from their president and from the media, that we focused on rational grief counseling and community support, including better mental health care combined with sensible gun control, we as a society might ultimately act more effectively to stop this madness. The opinions expressed in this documentary are solely those of Lawrence M. Krauss.","Lawrence Krauss: The horrific shootings in Newtown were a senseless massacre .

"(CNN) -- In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice has a history of stirring libidos, and it's no wonder. The longest day of the year tends to kick off the start of the summer season and with it, the harvest. So it should come as no surprise that the solstice is linked to fertility -- both of the vegetal and human variety. ""A lot of children are born nine months after Midsummer in Sweden,"" says Jan-Ã–jvind Swahn, a Swedish ethnologist and the author of several books on the subject. Midsummer is the Scandinavian holiday celebrating the summer solstice, which this year falls on June 21. Swedish traditions include dancing around a Maypole -- a symbol which some view as phallic -- and feasting on herring and copious amounts of vodka. ""Drinking is the most typical Midsummer tradition. There are historical pictures of people drinking to the point where they can't go on anymore,"" says Swahn. While the libations have a hand in the subsequent baby boom, Swahn points out that even without the booze, Midsummer is a time rich in romantic ritual. Read more: The science behind a solar eclipse . ""There used to be a tradition among unmarried girls, where if they ate something very salty during Midsummer, or else collected several different kinds of flowers and put these under their pillow when they slept, they would dream of their future husbands,"" he says. There is a similar mythology about dreaming of one's future spouse in parts of Greece. There, as in many European countries, the pagan solstice got co-opted by Christianity and rebranded as St. John's Day. Still, in many villages in the country's north, the ancient rites are still celebrated. One of the oldest rituals is called Klidonas, and involves local virgins gathering water from the sea. The village's unmarried women all place a personal belonging in the pot and leave it under a fig tree overnight, where -- folklore has it -- the magic of the day imbues the objects with prophetic powers, and the girls in question dream of their future husbands. The next day, all the women in the village gather, and take turns pulling out objects and reciting rhyming couplets that are meant to predict the romantic fortunes of the item's owner. These days, however, the festival is more an excuse for the community of women to exchange bawdy jokes. ""In my village, the older women always seem to come up with the dirtiest rhymes,"" says Eleni Fanariotou, who has filmed the custom. Later in the day, the sexes mingle and take turns jumping over a bonfire. Anyone who succeeds in jumping over the flames three times is meant to have a wish granted. Fanariotou says the festival often results in coupling. Read more: 5 real-life wonderlands . ""It's a good time to meet someone, because all the young people in the village go, and it's a good opportunity to socialize. Plus, all the men like to show off, and make the biggest fire they can to jump through."" In Eastern Europe, the solstice celebrations fall on Ivan Kupala Day -- a holiday that has romantic connotations for many Slavs (""kupala"" is derived from the same word as ""cupid""). ""It was once believed that Kupala night was a time for people to fall in love, and that those celebrating it would be happy and prosperous throughout the year,"" recalls Agnieszka Bigaj, from the Polish tourist board. It used to be that young, unmarried women would float floral wreaths in the river where eager bachelors on the other side would try to catching the flowers. she adds. According to Polish folklore, the man and woman in question would become a couple. Bonfires are also a large feature of the holiday, and it's tradition for a couple to leap through the flames together while holding hands -- if they don't let go, it is said their love will last. Test your knowledge of New Year customs . One of the largest solstice celebrations in the world, though, takes place at Stonehenge, where thousands gather each year to bring in the summer season. While for many the event is an excuse to party in the lead up to the Glastonbury Festival, there is also a strong contingent of pagans and neo-druids who treat the day like the ultimate marriage ceremony. ""All druid rituals have an element of fertility, and the solstice is no exception,"" says King Arthur Pendragon, a senior archdruid. ""We celebrate the union of the male and female deities -- the sun and the Earth -- on the longest day of the year.""","In many cultures, the longest day of the year is marked with celebrations meant to fan the flames of love and lust.
In Sweden, Midsummer is followed by a baby boom nine months later.
In Eastern Europe, the solstice is celebrated on Kupala Day, a kind of Slavic St. Valentine's.
In some villages in Northern Greece, women gather around to exchange bawdy rhymes on the morning of the solstice."
"(CNN) -- A contractor connected with a fatal building collapse in Philadelphia now faces murder charges. Authorities say Griffin Campbell, 49, was overseeing a building demolition in June when a four-story wall collapsed onto an adjacent Salvation Army thrift store, killing six people and injuring 13. Now Campbell is charged with six counts of third-degree murder and six counts of involuntary manslaughter, the Philadelphia District Attorney announced on Monday. Campbell also faces charges of recklessly endangering another person, causing catastrophe, risking catastrophe and criminal conspiracy. Attorney William Hobson, who is representing Campbell, told CNN his client would plead not guilty to the charges. According to a statement released by District Attorney Seth Williams, Campbell decided on the method of demolition. A day before the collapse, Campbell removed bricks and braces that had supported the wall, even though an architect warned him not to, the statement said. Campbell promised to build scaffolding to support the wall and said he would reduce its height to the roofline of the Salvation Army building, the District Attorney's Office said. ""In reality, however,"" the statement said, ""Campbell was unwilling to pay for enough labor to perform the task."" Campbell surrendered himself to police Monday afternoon, his attorney said. Hobson said he expects bail to be set at $1 million, with plans to seek a reduction. ""I hope Griffin Campbell's arrest today will give the victims and their families some small sense of relief, though I know their pain will never go away,"" Williams said on Monday. The prosecutor also announced Monday that crane operator Kary R. Roberts -- also known as Sean Benschop -- is facing an additional charge of criminal conspiracy in the case. Roberts is currently in jail awaiting a preliminary hearing for involuntary manslaughter and other counts, after police said toxicology results showed he was under the influence of a controlled substance at the site of the collapse. He has maintained his innocence. In June, his attorney, Daine Grey Jr., said his client was ""being made the scapegoat in this situation."" Williams said it is unclear at this point whether a grand jury will find more evidence of wrongdoing by others. ""This arrest is not the end of the grand jury's investigation,"" the statement said.","NEW: Prosecutor: ""This arrest is not the end of the grand jury's investigation""

"(CNN) -- A Saudi Arabian political science professor who is an outspoken human rights advocate was taken into custody this week by the country's secret police, his wife said Friday. Matrook al-Faleh, shown in 2004, was seized after he criticized prison conditions, says Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch issued a report calling for the release of Matrook al-Faleh, 54, who was seized at King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, two days after he publicly criticized conditions in a prison where two Saudi human rights activists are serving jail terms, according to the agency. Jamila al-Uqla, al-Faleh's wife, said her husband went to the university on Monday and never returned. She said police informed her that he was in custody at the city's main detention facility. The next day, al-Uqla said, she tried to call police back, but no one could give her more details. She said that police did not say why he was seized and that she has not heard from him since. ""I keep calling the secret police, but they keep denying they're holding him at their facility,"" she said. ""I have called his cell phone, but there is no answer. He has not called even once."" Al-Uqla said she and al-Faleh are patriotic Saudis. ""My husband is transparent and doesn't hide anything. He says whatever he sees. He has loyalty to his country and the interests of his country,"" she said. Joe Stork, deputy director at Human Rights Watch's Middle East division, said the arrest shows that human rights advocacy in Saudi Arabia remains ""a risky business."" ""By suppressing peaceful dissent, Saudi Arabia only stands to gain further notoriety as an abuser of human rights,"" Stock said in the report. Phone calls to Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry were not answered. On Saturday, Human Rights Watch said that al-Faleh sent an e-mail to human rights activists and journalists about visiting procedures and detention conditions at a Buraida General Prison, where his fellow friends are being held. He called the visiting procedures laborious and compared the visiting area to a ""chicken coop."" ""Al-Faleh's fellow activists, the brothers Abdullah al-Hamid and Isa al-Hamid, are serving prison sentences at Buraida General Prison for expressing support for a demonstration that took place in front of Buraida's secret police prison by wives and relatives of long-term detainees held there without charge,"" the group said. The activists decried the prison's conditions as filthy and crowded, with poor health care, according to Human Rights Watch, which said it independently confirmed such conditions. ""It is outrageous that the Ministry of Interior arbitrarily arrests Dr. al-Faleh rather than addressing the inhumane conditions he documented,"" Stork said. Al-Faleh, Abdullah al-Hamid and Ali al-Dumaini, who runs a Saudi discussion site, were arrested in 2004 for circulating a petition to then-Crown Prince Abdullah calling for a constitution guaranteeing basic human rights. A court sentenced Al-Faleh, Abdullah al-Hamid and Ali al-Dumaini, to six, seven and nine years respectively, but King Abdullah pardoned them in August 2005, Human Rights Watch said. Al-Faleh's recent statement had been reproduced on menber-alhewar.info, al-Dumaini's Web site, according to Human Rights Watch. In contrast to her husband's detention on Monday, al-Uqla said police in 2004 allowed her husband to call her just after his arrest. Saudi authorities arrested blogger Fouad al-Farhan in December after he called for the release of a group of detained peaceful reform activities. He was released in April. CNN's Roba Alhenawi, Mohammed Jamjoom and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Wife of professor Matrook al-Faleh says police told her on Monday that he was in jail .

"London (CNN) -- Yahoo is slamming as ""completely unacceptable"" a British agency's alleged collection of digital images while eavesdropping on webcam chats, a spokesperson for the Internet search engine said Thursday. And Yahoo says if the electronic spying took place, the online mainstay had nothing to do with it. ""We are not aware nor would we condone this reported activity,"" the spokesperson said following a published report by the UK-based Guardian newspaper that Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, known as GCHQ, spied on people using Yahoo webcam chats, whether or not those users were investigative targets. According to the Guardian report, which cites documents leaked by former National Security Agency intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, the GCHQ collected the images under a program known as ""Optic Nerve."" The documents show, according to the Guardian, that the GCHQ -- with reported aid from the U.S. National Security Agency -- intercepted and stored the webcam images of millions of Internet users. If the report is true, it is ""completely unacceptable,"" the Yahoo spokesperson said. The mass collection of digital images of Yahoo users began because GCHQ targets were known to use the search engine's webcam, the documents said, according to the Guardian. During a six-month stretch in 2008, the GCHQ allegedly collected images from webcam chats from 1.8 million Yahoo users globally, the newspaper reported. The still images were allegedly collected at five`-minute intervals during the chats. One document, according to the Guardian, compared the collection of digital images to that of a massive digital police mugshot book. GCHQ declined to speak to the allegations, citing a longstanding policy that it does not comment on intelligence matters. ""Furthermore, all of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorized, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight,"" according to a statement released by the agency's press office. GCHQ is not bound by the same rules that seek to limit the NSA collection of information on its citizens. However, according to the Guardian, there are additional legal authorizations required before the agency can search for data on suspected targets in believed to be in Britain. According to the documents, there was no mechanism in place to block the collection of data on U.S. and U.K. citizens, the Guardian reported. The leaked documents also allegedly provided insight into how the spy agency grappled with how to deal with the pornography it encountered in webcam chats. ""Unfortunately, it would appear that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate part of their body to the other person,"" one document said, according to the Guardian. The GCHQ estimated that up to 11% of the digital images it collected from the webcam chats were explicit, the Guardian reported, citing the leaked documents. As a result, the GCHQ allegedly warned its analysts that some of the material collected may be offensive. ""User who feel uncomfortable about such material are advised not to open them,"" one document said, according to the Guardian. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","""We are not aware nor would we condone this reported activity,"" a Yahoo official says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The flamboyant Hong Kong tycoon who offered millions of dollars to any man who could win the heart of his lesbian daughter says the proposal is now off the table. But he's still refusing to welcome her long-term female partner into his family. Cecil Chao, a wealthy real estate developer, made headlines around the world in 2012 when he offered 500 million Hong Kong dollars (roughly $65 million) to any man who succeeded in marrying his daughter. Recent reports that he was willing to double the offer put his family back in the headlines. Gigi Chao, 34, responded by writing him an open letter, published in local newspapers this week, asking him to come to terms with her sexuality. In the letter, she told him that she was happy in her relationship and urged him to treat her partner, Sean Eav, as ""a normal, dignified human being."" ""If Gigi's said that this is what she chooses, then it's all over,"" Cecil Chao said Thursday an interview with CNN's Monita Rajpal. He said the huge sum he had offered to potential suitors ""stays in my pocket."" Daughter asks him to accept who she is . Refusal to welcome partner . But the 77-year-old tycoon, who has three children but has never married, is unable to embrace his daughter's love life. ""I can't say I am happy with her choice,"" he said. ""If this is her choice then it's for her."" And he said he wouldn't be welcoming Eav, 46, into his family, despite his daughter's plea. ""I have no intention of mixing my life with her life,"" Cecil Chao said. ""But if this is what she wants, then I respect her choice."" His comments follow Gigi Chao's poignant letter, explaining the situation to him. ""As your daughter, I would want nothing more than to make you happy,"" she writes. ""But in terms of relationships, your expectations of me and the reality of who I am, are not coherent."" 'Her private life is hers' Cecil Chao originally proposed the multimillion dollar dowry in 2012 after it emerged that his daughter and Eav had their relationship blessed in a church ceremony in Paris. He said Thursday that his daughter had never told him in person that she was a lesbian. ""I saw it in the paper,"" he told CNN's Rajpal, even though they work together at his company. ""We see each other every day,"" he said. ""We have many occasions to be together, but her private life is hers."" The successful businessman earned a reputation in Hong Kong for appearing on the pages of local newspapers and magazines in the arms of beautiful women. He once reportedly bragged of having had 10,000 girlfriends. Men are 'just not for me' In her letter, Gigi Chao tells her father that she ""will always forgive you for thinking the way you do, because I know you think you are acting in my best interests."" And she says she takes responsibility for some of her father's misplaced expectations. When he first announced the colossal dowry in 2012, she said at the time she found it ""quite entertaining."" But this week she appeared to set the record straight. ""I'm sorry to mislead you to think I was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good, suitable men in Hong Kong,"" she writes. ""There are plenty of good men, they are just not for me."" Decision not final . Cecil Chao said Thursday that he offered the money any man who could wed his daughter because he wanted ""to provide the best choice for Gigi"" for her future life. She says in her letter that she felt ""an indescribable discomfort"" in the presence of boyfriends she had in the past. But with 46-year-old Eav, she says she is ""comfortable and satisfied with my life and completely at ease with her."" In the interview Thursday, Cecil Chao repeatedly said that the big financial offer to any man who could win his daughter's hand in marriage was finished. ""I hope you or the other press are not going to talk about it anymore,"" he told Rajpal. But he also suggested that he wasn't letting go of the idea entirely, saying that the offer was over ""for the time being."" When asked what he meant by that, he said, ""Until she changes her mind."" CNN's Michala Sabnani and journalist Alisha Haridasani contributed to this report.","Cecil Chao says the money he offered ""stays in my pocket""

"Washington (CNN) -- It's pretty clear the House of Representatives is not going to take up immigration reform this year. Even after President Barack Obama said he was willing to consider immigration legislation in pieces instead of one large bill -- which House Speaker John Boehner has suggested -- just a handful of workdays remain for the House this year. Obama's concession might open the door for the House to consider the issue next year, but it's going to take more than the president's backing. And more than his personal campaigning. Related: Protests meet Obama at immigration event . Speaking to supporters in San Francisco Monday, Obama called on House Republicans to take up the bill already passed by the Senate. ""It's long past time to fix our broken immigration system,"" he said. With the growing Latino population, the national Republican Party understands it must embrace the immigration issue. Additionally, the public supports action. Two polls released this month show an overwhelming majority of Americans -- 63% in a Public Religion Research Institute survey and 57% in a Quinnipiac poll -- support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Related: Polls: Majority still support pathway to citizenship . But some factions within the Republican base are adamantly opposed to any legislation that includes a path to citizenship. This division creates a challenge for Republicans. Their answer: maybe later. GOP strategist Ana Navarro told CNN that the timing ""is just not right"" and that the legislation is ""not ripe and not ready."" Here are some scenarios when the timing could be right: . 1. When Obamacare works . As long as the Affordable Care Act is receiving negative headlines, immigration will be on the back burner. During a discussion last week on the House floor between Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, Cantor repeatedly pivoted away from the issue of immigration to Obamacare. ""What's going on with Obamacare right now ... I don't think we ought to be engaging in those kinds of commitments when you can't deliver,"" Cantor said about bringing up immigration. Hoyer responded: ""We understand ... you'd like to talk about health care without talking about anything else. I get that."" Related: Biden welcomes new Americans, slams Boehner on immigration bill . The GOP sees Obamacare as a winning issue politically. It's a major reason it won back the House in 2010, and the head of the Republican National Committee declared Republicans will run on Obamacare in 2014. Republicans are reticent to change the subject while they appear to be winning the message war. 2. 'The sweet spot' The House can bring up immigration legislation in 2014, but controversial topics are usually swept under the rug come election time. Navarro said that next year, particularly the summer, might be the right time. ""The sweet spot is to do it sometime so it's far enough from the election so it doesn't become a big issue,"" she said. Related: Pro-immigration attack ads to target House Republicans . In other words, don't upset the parts of the base that are anti-immigration but appeal to the majority of Americans who support an overhaul of the immigration system. The former could be prove more tricky as Republicans have to take into consideration primary voters and the possibility of primary challengers. Some factions of the Republican Party are against any bill that includes a path to citizenship or legal residency for undocumented immigrants, which they see as amnesty. For instance, Heritage Action for America, a lobbying and campaign arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, worked to get Senate Republicans to vote against the immigration bill last spring. Immigration is not considered a top-tier issue, but Republicans do risk backlash. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said he regretted his vote on comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship and that passed in the Senate this year. He helped to draft the bill. Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group involved in pushing legislation through the House, said the GOP leadership is considering the stances of immigration opponents. ""Boehner and company seem a bit more concerned with tea party types ... more concerned with their conservative members who could face ouster,"" Sharry said. If the House waits long enough next year to bring up immigration, it would be too late for immigration to be an issue in the primaries and, perhaps more importantly, too late for challengers to jump in the race and make it an issue. 3. Feelings must be mended . Leslie Sanchez, a Republican strategist who has worked on immigration for nearly two decades, said it is a must-pass issue for the GOP to stay a relevant political party at the national level. But she said ""a hostile political environment"" is the biggest factor in prohibiting immigration legislation. Related: Shutdown threat imperils immigration reform . The recent government shutdown was perhaps a low point during an already perilous time in Washington. The trust factor between the two parties plummeted. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, refused to attend a meeting at the White House to discuss immigration, calling it a ""trap."" ""The shutdown was very toxic. Right now, it's very difficult,"" said Navarro, the Republican strategist. And Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said few lawmakers from opposite parties are talking to each other. ""I just think the lines of communication between the parties have really broken down,"" Noorani said. 4. When Republican proponents outweigh opponents . Another problem inhibiting an immigration bill is lack of incentives for Republican lawmakers to stick their necks out. ""Republicans have not gotten to yes,"" Sharry said. And until they do, Boehner is reluctant to bring a bill to the floor. ""I don't think they will bring it up until they can get it passed,"" Navarro said, highlighting that Boehner is reluctant to bring a bill to the floor that would pass with mostly Democratic support. One immigration proposal similar to the Senate version has the support of 190 lawmakers, a handful of whom are Republicans. Rep. Jeff Denham, a Republican from an agricultural region of California, is one of the bill's co-sponsors. He said there are at least six more Republicans who support the bill but haven't come out publicly yet. But that's far short of a majority. To get more on board, a coalition of ""bibles, business and badges"" -- representing key constituencies -- is attempting to use its influence to pressure Republicans. Related: Zuckerberg-backed group makes new immigration push . ""It's going to take a great deal of momentum and districts from across the nation,"" Denham said. Now that Boehner said there will be not bill this year, Republicans have little reason to put their name on legislation that could be politically disadvantageous. ""The biggest challenge of this bill is there is not a deadline,"" Denham said. ""That's part of the reason this continues to get pushed.""","The House will not take up immigration legislation this year .
A bill is ""not ripe and not ready,"" a Republican strategist says .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona put on a sumptuous display against Rayo Vallecano and it was no surprise that Lionel Messi led the way, rewriting the record books in the process. The four-time world player of the year scored two goals to give him 228 overall in the Spanish league, passing Alfredo di Stefano's mark and placing the Argentine into a tie for third with a man who, like di Stefano, made a name for himself at Real Madrid, Raul. Barring a serious injury and change of leagues, Messi -- who did miss two months this season with a leg complaint -- is sure to take over top spot from Telmo Zarra. The latter scored 251 goals, 17 more than Hugo Sanchez. ""I'd like to think that Messi still has a bit to go before he's 100 percent fit,"" Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino told the club website. ""If he wants, he'll break any record he sets his mind to. ""He's only 26 years old and he'll lose count (of the records he breaks). Barca enjoy him and Argentina does as well."" Barcelona's awesome display against Vallecano prompted the Catalan club's website to use the word 'caviar' in describing the affair and the free-flowing football on offer served as a warning for Manchester City, which collides with Barca next week in the Champions League. Messi's goals came in the 38th and 68th minutes at the Camp Nou, with Adriano, Pedro, Alexis Sanchez and the returning Neymar chipping in with the others. Neymar, the Brazilian whiz, had missed about three weeks with an ankle injury. ""This month has been long,"" Neymar told reporters. ""I was very eager to play."" Despite the ruthless performance, Barcelona can't gain a significant lead over Atletico Madrid. Madrid earlier Saturday blanked Real Valladolid 3-0 at home, realistically claiming all three points with two goals in the first four minutes. It was relief for Atletico, which had lost three straight games in all competitions. ""It was convenient, fast and what I like is the intensity with which the team went out with,"" Atletico manager Diego Simeone told the club website.

But this is a story with a happy ending, as fan Rick Wee was given an access-all-areas tour and a chance to meet his heroes by way of recompense. Wee has supported the English Premier League team, which prides itself on a reputation of being the ""People's Club"", for 30 years -- admittedly from some 6,500 miles away in his home country. On Wednesday, he had tweeted excitedly prior to the Crystal Palace game: ""Finally, 30 years since since supporting @Everton, will be watching EFC ""live"" for the 1st time,"" complete with a picture of him in his seats some time before kickoff . Less than an hour later, the game had been called off due to building damage nearby and, complete with a picture of his ticket, he bemoaned: ""Dream to watch EFC play will continue to be on hold."" But such is the power of social media website Twitter that, thousands of retweets later, Wee, in the stands with his family, was contacted by the club. Everton press office Helen Mayo wrote: ""We've found him and are making sure he doesn't leave too disappointed, taking him to meet some of his heroes right now."" He was duly invited behind the scenes and into the players' lounge and dressing room where he met manager Roberto Martinez and left-back Leighton Baines, with whom he was later pictured sharing a laugh and a joke. A disbelieving Wee later commented: ""Wish to thank @Everton for great hospitality. Really appreciate it. Also much obliged to the many Evertonians sending warm messages over"". He later added: ""Today @Everton just proved again that it's the People's Club taking extra effort to connect with fans. Salute the people running the club."" He returned to Goodison Park again on Thursday for a further more in-depth tour by former Everton striker Graeme Sharp to make his lifelong trip from Asia even more worthwhile.

"(CNN) -- After a fine display against Manchester City in the Champions League, Barcelona couldn't back it up in La Liga. Combined with Real Madrid's victory, it means Barcelona was knocked off top spot in Spain. Barcelona suffered just its third league loss of the campaign when it was beaten 3-1 at Real Sociedad, with manager Gerardo Martino sent off for complaining to the referee. When Lionel Messi equalized in the 36th minute, most everyone must have thought Barcelona would go on to claim all three points. But two goals in a five-minute spell early in the second half handed Sociedad -- now unbeaten in four games -- all three points. For once Barcelona failed to convert its possession -- 65 percent -- to goals and midfielder Andres Iniesta admitted Sociedad was the better side. ""Real played really well,"" Iniesta told Barcelona's website. ""They were better than us, we were always trailing them. ""I don't know if this is a step back, but the feelings after the match aren't good. We didn't interpret the game like we were supposed to, and we paid for it. Real had a better approach. ""This defeat shouldn't make us give up. We have to work hard and turn this situation around. There are many points left, and we have games against direct rivals."" Atletico Madrid can join city rival Real Madrid atop the standings and on 63 points, three more than Barcelona, if it wins Sunday. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique wasn't too concerned, though. ""We're just one game off being league leaders so it's not too troubling,"" he said. ""These things can happen. When you attack it's possible for them to score. Sometimes you don't feel comfortable on the pitch."" Cristiano Ronaldo served the third game of his three-game suspension for Real Madrid but it didn't stop Real Madrid from easing past Elche 3-0 at home. Gareth Bale, who has struggled since moving to Spain from England's Tottenham, scored his team's second goal with a long-range effort into the top corner. ""Bale didn't have confidence before scoring his great goal and after that he was totally different,"" Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""I am satisfied because we didn't concede. Our play could have been better but at this stage of the season we need to be solid and we were."" Hamburg stunner . Hamburg escaped the relegation zone in Germany in style, thumping fading Borussia Dortmund 3-0 at home in Mirko Slomka's debut. Slomka replaced Dutchman Bert van Marwijk, who was sacked after Hamburg lost seven straight in the Bundesliga. Hakan Calhanoglu scored one of the goals of the season when he shot past keeper Roman Weidenfeller from near the halfway mark -- on a free kick. ""I practice (free kicks) every single day,"" the Turkish under-20 international told the league's website. ""If you don't, then you lose or forget your shooting technique. That's why I knew I could do it. I just thought to myself, 'Focus and hit it like in training.' ""It was the best goal of my career."" Nurnberg scored two goals a minute apart in the second half to down last-place Eintracht Braunschweig but the game was notable for this: Three penalties were missed, a first in Bundesliga history. Bayer Leverkusen's 3-1 loss to Wolfsburg meant idle Bayern Munich maintained its hefty 16-point lead in first. In Italy, Roma moved to within six points of leader Juventus with a 1-0 win at relegation threatened Bologna.","Barcelona suffers a rare defeat in Spain, losing at Real Sociedad .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- Fidel Castro's nearly five decades of rule ended Sunday when Cuba's National Assembly chose his younger brother Raul to be the country's new president. The lawmakers' selection, which had been widely expected, came five days after Fidel Castro, 81, announced his resignation in a letter published in the state-run newspaper Granma. In his address to the National Assembly, the 76-year-old Raul Castro proposed that ""we consult Fidel"" on important decisions. The 614 members of the legislative body passed that motion unanimously. The lawmakers also announced that Jose Ramon Machado, a man of Raul Castro's generation, had been elected first vice president of the Council of State, despite the expectation of some that the post would go to someone younger. The Council of State acts on behalf of the Assembly -- which meets only twice a year -- when it is not in session.  Watch how Fidel Castro will still play a role in Cuba » . Juan Almeida Bosque, Abelardo Colomi Ibarra, Carlos Lage Davila, Esteban Lazo Hernandez and Julio Casas Regueiro were elected as the Council's other vice presidents, according to Granma. Fidel Castro was not present at the National Assembly meeting. In his letter of resignation published in the newspaper, he cited his ""critical health condition"" and said, ""It would be a betrayal to my conscience to accept a responsibility requiring more mobility and dedication than I am physically able to offer."" The elder Castro underwent intestinal surgery in 2006, when he transferred some powers to Raul, the country's longtime defense minister. In his first communication since announcing the announcement, Fidel Castro lashed out Friday at U.S. President Bush in a newspaper column, saying Bush's idea of change for Cuba would amount to annexation of the island nation. He said that, after his announcement, ""I slept better than ever ... My conscience was clear and I promised myself a vacation."" Raul Castro, who is shorter, less imposing and less charismatic than his brother, was the architect of the Cuban army and its leader for almost 50 years. As Cuba's acting president, he has kept a low profile. About six months ago, he began what he called a ""national debate"" on the problems of the country, acknowledging high unemployment and other economic concerns. ""Is there going to be a transition here toward something?"" Raul Castro once told reporters asking about post-Fidel Cuba. ""Yes, toward a better form of socialism and -- here's something you'll like -- toward a more democratic society."" However, he has said that only the Communist Party can guarantee continuity and, in his address Sunday to the National Assembly, he called the Party the ""the guarantee of the Cuban nation."" Raul Castro helped his brother plan the uprising that brought about the Cuban revolution, put Fidel Castro in power in 1959 and gave birth to the Western Hemisphere's first Communist power. The brothers were born in Biran, Cuba, sons of a Spanish immigrant -- a rich landowner -- and a housemaid whom he eventually married. During the early years of the revolution, the younger Castro earned a reputation for being ruthless with his enemies. Grainy black-and-white video shows him making impassioned speeches in the early days of the revolution. Even before his brother announced his retirement, Raul Castro said Fidel would be a hard act to follow. Fidel Castro's daughter, Alina Fernandez, who lives in Florida, told CNN that Sunday's events were unlikely to significantly affect the country. She has long opposed her father's regime. ""I think that the government will remain mostly the same, but I think they are going to bring on different faces that they need,"" she said. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Meet the future. Her name is Maya Shaoolian. She is 2 years old. Maya is just learning the basics of reading and writing, but she's a veteran of technology. She's been using an iPad since she was 1, says her father, Gabriel Shaoolian, the founder and CEO of marketing agency Blue Fountain Media. It's fun for her, he says. It's also a window into how she'll communicate: with apps and texts and instant images and video. ""She is part of a generation that will know nothing else but 140 characters and 16 seconds of video,"" Shaoolian said. ""She is part of a generation that will never know what a commercial is, because she consumes everything on demand. She wants content when she wants it, and without any interruptions. And it better be bite-size, because that is really all she has time for -- and all her brain processes."" This is not a lament, he hastens to add. Shaoolian says he draws his greatest lessons in technology usage from Maya. In fact, he thinks Maya and her friends will be better at making sense of those tweets and video snippets than, well, us. ""Her generation will be much more efficient communicating and grasping information,"" he said. ""I am certain that she will read between the lines and grasp every nuance, because she has not had to relearn how to communicate or digest information. This is the only way she knows."" Well, OK. But where does that leave the rest of us? The blur of communications has progressed from letters and e-mails to texts, tweets and Instagram pictures. Long, detailed speeches have turned into clips, then sound bites, then Vines, Snapchat and animated GIFs. Yes, we're adjusting to an image-intensive, brevity-favoring world, a world as close and available as our smartphone. It's a fast-growing, hugely popular world that rewards short attention spans. Instagram was born in 2010; as of June, it has 130 million monthly active users and 45 million photos posted per day. Vine, the six-second video app introduced by the Twitter folks in January, became the iTunes app store's most popular free download within three months. It had 13 million users as of June, and its most active users post more than 14 Vines per day. Not to be outdone, Instagram launched its own short-video feature in June. Users of Snapchat, a messaging platform popular with teens, exchange 200 million pictures a day. President Obama's campaign used a Twitter photo to express thanks after his 2012 re-election; it became the most popular tweet in Twitter's history. Danny DeVito sends out photobombing pictures of his ""troll foot"" at every opportunity. Creative types have used Vine and Instagram to create memes, jokes and art. All this gives new meaning to the Internet rule, ""Pics or it didn't happen."" 'All about the visuals' That's certainly the case with Sam Green, the 25-year-old vice president of RiTE Media Group, an Atlanta-based video production company. Green only got turned on to Instagram eight months ago, he says, but has been so won over by the app he's practically given up texting or posting written messages to Facebook. The benefits are many, he says: more attention from the public, more convenience for him, more engagement in general. ""It's all about the visuals,"" he said. ""We could post a (text) saying we're on the set with Ludacris or we could post a picture with Ludacris, and that was getting a lot more views. People like to be able to see the proof behind the text. It's a much more honest way to engage for the audience."" He says the company's success has been driven by its Instagram push, estimating that 20% of RiTE's clientele has come through the service. Nick Teissler, a 19-year-old student at Georgia Tech, is a fan of Vine. For him and his friends, Vine and Snapchat ""are bigger than Instagram."" Facebook doesn't even enter into the conversation, he says. (Mark Zuckerberg, call your office.) The Vine videos are an easy way to share humor, he says. ""Humor, kind of expressing frustration,"" he said. ""It's rare to have an informative Vine out there."" Instagram, he says with impish disdain, ""is more for people who want to express themselves and let people know that they're expressing themselves."" All these services are known for their brevity and convenience. Anthony Jack, a Case Western Reserve University professor whose work crosses the disciplines of psychology, neuroscience and philosophy, likes those details: One of the great benefits of social media, he points out, is the creativity that brevity inspires. ""It encourages people to distill ideas down to their core, and then only the ones that really stick get shared. So it is an effective way of generating incisive commentary,"" he said. But he wonders whether something is being lost. It takes more than brief bursts of creativity to actually, well, communicate -- to really understand someone else's perspective. ""Understanding others' experience lies at the core of true moral understanding. It connects us to others and gives us a real appreciation of their motives and beliefs,"" he said. ""So the danger is that social media is making us fall back on what we already understand: our stereotypes and preconceived notions. When social communication is so accessible and immediate, it can also become very shallow."" Remapping the brain . That's been a concern of older generations for, well, generations. When the telephone started becoming popular in the late 19th century, adults worried that youngsters were using it for flirtation. Television was derided as the ""boob tube,"" and high-minded academics wondered why the promise of education and social uplift had been replaced by ""Mr. Ed"" reruns. Now we have these remarkable smartphones, devices with amazing computing and imaging power, and we use them for ... taking pictures of ourselves. Tammy Vigil, a professor in Boston University's College of Communication, routinely sees it among her students. With the way these photos spread on social media, she looks at it as ""sort of an interesting attempt at fame, almost. It's sort of being their own paparazzi. They put out these pictures of themselves, and they hope they get pushed on."" She finds it striking that Snapchat and Instagram express two different attitudes toward social fame. Snapchat, after all, assumes that your image will be quickly wiped. Instagram, however, is presumably forever: ""It's almost like a photo album,"" Vigil said. Some observers worry that photos may not provide the same nuance as text. But Dr. Gopal Chopra, a neurosurgeon and the creator of PINGMD, a medical data communication service, notes that the brain is tremendously flexible. It's just a matter of how much effort we put into assessing all that information flying at us, he says. The nuances we pick up through text we can also learn visually, though it takes time. Think of muscle memory, he says: With enough repetition, the brain can create new pathways for physical tasks. The same is true in going from one medium to another. ""It's plasticity,"" he said. ""We are remapping. And it does take time. But it takes an effort to go from the BlackBerry to an iPhone."" But for those willing to make the effort, the brain can adjust. ""From a neuroscience perspective, the brain is such an underestimated storehouse and synthesis house when it comes to information,"" he said. Full circle? Another grumble is that we're leaving text behind completely and that coming generations will be worse off for it. However, Rob Weiss, a therapist and executive with Elements Behavioral Health, says that's just generational moralizing. ""When I sit down with a bunch of therapists and ask what's going on, they can't help but tell me about worried they are about young people, how young people are going to lose their communications skills, they're going to be unempathetic towards other people, they're going to be narcissistic ... all of this negativity,"" said Weiss, whose forthcoming book, ""Closer Together, Further Apart,"" is about the effect of technology on intimacy and relationships. ""I think this is generational. This is just like sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, when our parents were horrified."" Instead, he says, it's simply another turn -- one in which we don't know the results yet. Besides, it's an evolution that's been going on for, well, generations. In Homer's day, the ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey"" were presented orally. Then we transitioned to the printed word. Books eventually gave way to radio -- another version of the oral tradition -- and then television. When the Internet appeared, it was back to text. Now, Boston University's Vigil points out, text is giving way to images again -- but that doesn't mean the other forms of communication will go away. They're all just tools, she says. ""I don't foresee (image services) meaning that we won't text anymore. It think it's going to be more of a balancing act between them,"" she said. In the future, who knows? We could be communicating by Google's connected Glass eyewear or by using our tech-embedded clothing. By then, it will be truly be Maya Shaoolian's world. ""How she gets that information she likes has completely evolved from the way you and I grew up getting it,"" her father said. ""What we're doing now is unthinkable 20 years ago.""","Messaging has progressed from e-mails to texts, tweets, Vines and Instagram pics .

"(CNN) -- A Florida task force on Friday recommended that the state's controversial ""stand your ground"" law not be overturned. The body, appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, found that the ""majority of Floridians favor an expansive right to self-defense."" The law states that a person is permitted to use force in self-defense without first having to retreat from a potentially dangerous situation. ""All persons who are conducting themselves in a lawful manner have a fundamental right to stand their ground and defend themselves from attack with proportionate force in every place they have a lawful right to be,"" the 44-page report said. Since its enactment in Florida in 2006, the law has been frequently cited in cases ranging from an incident in which a man sprayed a vehicle carrying a known gang member with 14 bullets to the 2011 case of a man who was cleared under ""stand your ground"" after stabbing a man in the head with an ice pick during a road rage incident. The number of justifiable homicides reported in the state has skyrocketed since the law went into effect. In the five years before the law's approval, Florida averaged 12 justifiable homicides a year, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In the six years since, the average is 33. Scott formed the task force on March 22 in response to the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager. Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, after a confrontation. The incident sparked national outcry, prompted a Justice Department investigation and raised questions about the controversial law.","The body found that the ""majority of Floridians favor an expansive right to self-defense""

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Marketplace Africa launched 100 episodes ago. That¹s one hundred weeks of African business news that brought our global audience a fresh perspective from a continent that has not normally been viewed as an investor-friendly destination. We kicked off the first show by interviewing Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was then the managing director of the IMF. His wife, Anne, was with him and he proudly introduced me to her, reminding me that both she and I were both broadcasters. She is a famous news interviewer in France. Then, I interviewed him on the stage at a local university theatre. It was a small and intimate setting, so very different from the glare of the global spotlight in which he later found himself. My interview with his successor Christine Lagarde more than 90 episodes later was a very different affair. We met in a smart Pretoria hotel with a view of South Africa¹s Union Buildings, the seat of government. She was shuttling from Africa to the Middle East to Europe and seemed to have a punishing travel schedule but nevertheless looked elegant and not in the least bit fatigued by jetlag or the European debt crisis. She patiently took time to explain why Africa should care about what happens in the Eurozone. Looking back, though, it is always gratifying to take the show on the road. We reported from Kibera slum in Kenya where we discovered that even the poorest consumers were driving changes in the way multinationals were making and distributing their products. We went to Tanzania and its administrative and financial hub, Dar es Salaam, to investigate how the mobile revolution was changing the way poor women had access to healthcare. While there, we also talked to Tanzanians about schemes to rent land to South Koreans, who were planning to plant rice paddies and export the food back to South Korea. This is all part of a continent-wide push to utilize Africa¹s land resources smartly. See also: Interview with Zimbabwean Finance Minister . Importantly, we took the show to Zimbabwe and reported from the streets of Harare and the parched lands in Mashonaland West. We explored how remittances, money that is ""sent home"" from family members in the United Kingdom or South Africa, supports entire communities. However, the realities of life in Zimbabwe were made starkly clear to our crew when police and intelligence officers in Harare briefly detained us. Despite having permission to film, these security forces threatened us and insisted we be taken to a notorious central prison for further questioning. They were suspicious and uncomfortable with a foreign TV crew filming openly on the street, even though the Zimbabwean Ministry of Information insisted that international media were now welcome in the country. We were released only after we made a phone call to a cabinet minister who managed to get the message to them that we were to be left alone. We continued filming and presenting Marketplace Africa for the next few days and those two shows give a deep understanding of the political and economic realities in the country. The free press in Ethiopia was one of my favorite stories on our show. We highlighted an innovative scheme of newspaper renting on the street corners of Addis Ababa. Many Ethiopians cannot afford to buy newspapers or magazines, so enterprising newspaper ""landlords"" rent out the daily news for a small fee. See also: Is the 'blood diamond' concept changing? It is always gratifying when an interview is a lively discussion that introduces you to new facts. Ntebo Rajuili¹s advice on how to do business in Africa was great fun as she explained some cultural quirks in different African countries, which might hinder or help when doing business. Of course, chatting with Oprah Winfrey about educating young girls was a treat. I wish we could have used the whole half hour of that interview rather than just four minutes. As we all know, Oprah makes for good TV. Jim O¹Neill is the economist who charted the rise of emerging nations Brazil, Russia, India and China and then coined the phrase BRIC. His insightful analysis was fascinating. He expressed confusion as to why South Africa, a relatively small economic player, had been admitted into this group of global big hitters. Recently we presented Marketplace Africa from a tugboat in Durban harbor. We were investigating the challenges facing Africa¹s busiest port and what better way to do it than to hitch a ride on a working ship? As for the next hundred episodes, the journey will continue to be just like doing business in Africa: Exciting, perhaps slightly risky, but with the promise of excellent results.","Launched 100 weeks ago, Marketplace Africa brings African business news to the global audience.
The show traveled extensively across the continent to deliver news from a fresh perspective.

"(CNN) -- The former partner of French President Francois Hollande said she felt like she ""was falling from a skyscraper"" when she learned about his alleged affair with an actress, Paris Match magazine said Thursday. Trierweiler gave an interview to the magazine, where she's worked for years, during a visit to Mumbai, India. She was in the nation to support the work of a charity fighting hunger. The trip came two days after Hollande announced their split. ""It's not because I'm no longer the first lady that life has to stop,"" Trierweiler told Paris Match in an interview published Thursday, adding that she will continue her charity work with various organizations. Don't worry about me, I'm fine, says France's former first lady . When she learned about the alleged affair, there was already a ""detachment"" from Hollande, but the media coverage made the breakup harder, Trierweiler said. She also told Paris Match she had heard rumors about the alleged affair, but did not pay attention to them. Hollande's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the French magazine Closer claimed this month he'd been having an affair with actress Julie Gayet for two years. The President, who has not confirmed or denied the claim announced Saturday that his relationship with Trierweiler was over. ""I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler,"" Hollande told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Trierweiler sent a goodbye message Saturday via Twitter to the staff at the presidential palace. ""All my gratitude goes to the extraordinary people at the Elysee. I will never forget the devotion or emotion at the time of leaving,"" she wrote.","Valerie Trierweiler tells Paris Match of impact of learning of her partner's alleged affair .

"(CNN) -- Dangerous cold and treacherous driving conditions left millions of Americans along the Eastern Seaboard stuck at home Wednesday. And, try as we might, we couldn't get any glimmers of hope from the CNN weather department's forecast for what's ahead. The storm system that dumped record-breaking piles of snow -- including 18-inch snowdrifts in Plymouth, Massachusetts -- is moving off the coast, and remaining blizzard warnings are expiring. But the freezing weather is going to stick around. ""Another clipper will reinforce the cold air already in place, so any snow on the ground is expected to hang around,"" CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. And ""more surges of cold Arctic air are on tap for next week,"" added CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. ""New York stays well below freezing for the foreseeable future -- possibly holding until the end of the month, though there's a chance they could briefly rise above 32 degrees Saturday afternoon. Washington, D.C., isn't expected to rise above freezing until Saturday afternoon, when it will be a balmy 37 degrees. But there's more cold and snow on the way early next week."" Meanwhile, in California, some cities are tying records -- for heat. Paso Robles reached 75 degrees Tuesday, while Camarillo reached 84. But through the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast, temperatures were 15 to 25 degrees below average Wednesday. Washington's Dulles International Airport recorded about 8 inches of snow Tuesday. New York's Central Park saw 11 inches. Bridgeport, Connecticut, had 6Â½. Governors in Delaware, New Jersey and New York issued states of emergency. This blizzard did not follow a typical pattern, Petersons said. The heaviest snowfall was closer to the coast rather than inland, even though the system was moving from west to east. The storm system strengthened off the coast, picking up moisture from the Atlantic to bump up the snowfall. Staying home and heading out . Rich Schultz, a father of three in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, told CNN he was spending the day cooking and planning meals for the week, including shepherd's pie and tomato, corn and basil soup. Others have been venturing out, with potentially deadly consequences. Three people have died in Pennsylvania in what appear to be weather-related incidents, according to Dana Todd of the Delaware County Medical Examiner's Office. ""Evidence would suggest that weather was a factor, but autopsies have not been performed yet,"" she said. The deaths include two men -- ages 67 and 87 -- who were out shoveling, and a 92-year-old woman who had wandered outside her home, Todd said. Nature photographer Candice Trimble spent Tuesday catching and photographing snowflakes up close in Front Royal, Virginia, she said in a CNN iReport. It was a time for play for some in Philadelphia. With about a foot of snow falling on the city, the steps at the Museum of Art became a sledding hill. On Facebook, dozens of people told CNN about the silver linings they've been finding in the storm. It ""makes you very grateful"" for the ""wealth you have"" in taking care of ""basic human needs,"" Sue Skoo wrote. ""Beer stays cold without refrigeration,"" Dan Evans added. Out West, at least one Utah resident didn't understand what all the fuss was about. ""A storm brings 10"" of snow to Utah and we throw a party,"" Drew Stoddard, who lives south of Salt Lake City, posted on Twitter. ""It happens in New York and they declare a state of emergency."" Travel concerns . Around the Northeast, some schools and offices were closed, and some roads were shut down. More than 1,400 flights were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. At New York's LaGuardia Airport, weary travelers spent a restless and sleep-deprived night on airport chairs and cold floors. Flight cancellations put hotel rooms in short supply. Susan Otterstrom found out Tuesday that she had two more days in the Big Apple, instead of returning to Illinois. ""I got a call that (my flight) was canceled, and I couldn't reschedule until Thursday,"" she told CNN affiliate WPIX. Another traveler said she was resigned to living the concourse life until she could catch a flight out. ""I'm just going to stay here and work and doze and whatever,"" she said. ""You do what you have to do."" Amtrak was running a modified schedule on the Northeast Corridor, saying passengers should expect some delays and fewer trains between Washington and Boston.

"(CNN) -- Rebekah Brooks, the former boss of News International, begins her defense Wednesday against allegations that she was part of a conspiracy to intercept the voicemails of high-profile figures in Britain. Dubbed the phone hacking trial, it has ensnared big names, including Andy Coulson, a former Downing Street communications director. Brooks faces three counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice linked to claims she plotted to remove boxes of documents from News International offices, and hide computers and documents from police. She denies any wrongdoing. She resigned as chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's News International in July 2011 amid outrage over claims of widespread hacking by staff at its News of the World newspaper. Once feted as a rising star in British media, she was the youngest person to edit a national British newspaper. She held the top job at News International, News Corp.'s British subsidiary, for two years after editing the country's best-selling daily tabloid, The Sun, and its best-selling Sunday tabloid, News of the World. But following sweeping allegations of illegal eavesdropping by News of the World journalists when she was editor, she has seen her fortunes fade, and was arrested and questioned several times by police investigating hacking, prior to being charged. News International is News Corp.'s British newspaper arm . The fallout forced Murdoch to shut down the News of the World in 2011.","Dubbed the phone hacking trial, it has ensnared big names .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee said Wednesday that the agency should look at updated data on mercury amalgam dental fillings that may indicate possible medical problems for patients. The panel -- after hearing two days of testimony from experts, members of the public and dental professionals -- recommended the FDA look at information updated since the agency ruled in 2009 that the mercury in dental fillings is not harmful. Committee members noted, however, that the FDA's decision was solid, based on information available at the time. The committee also stressed that more studies need to be done on amalgam fillings, especially in children. Public pressure prompted the panel's review, initiated less than 18 months after the agency's decision. Committee members listened to testimony by consumer and dental groups claiming the FDA used flawed science when it set the current guidelines for mercury safety levels. ""We need to see where the science is and if there are gaps."" said the panel's chairwoman, Dr. Marjorie Jeffcoat, a dentist and researcher with the University of Pennsylvania. In its final rule, the FDA concluded clinical studies did not establish a causal link between dental amalgam and health problems in people age 6 and older. But it did add that developing fetuses and young children may be more sensitive to the neurotoxin. Amalgam tooth fillings are an alloy made up of various metals and 50 percent mercury, . Mercury toxicity has been well documented, but when it comes to amalgam fillings there isn't a lot of data. Many dentists favor these fillings because they are cheap, easy to put in place and durable. Dental professionals also argue that mercury fillings last longer than resin composites, and are easier on the tooth. The American Dental Association agrees with the FDA that amalgam fillings are safe. Yet, some experts say mercury from these fillings penetrates into the body and damages human cells, especially in the brain, bones and kidneys. How much damage it is unknown, which is why the advisory committee is revisiting the issue. In Wednesday's public hearing, 30 people testified for and against the use of amalgam fillings. Jessica Kerger, an attorney from Toledo, Ohio, said she was a healthy child until she started getting amalgam fillings. As she got older, she faced numerous health problems and a variety of diagnoses. She even had her amalgam fillings removed. It wasn't until a doctor tested her for mercury poisoning that she realized her problem, she said. Now, after being treated for excess mercury in her body, Kerger said, ""I'm an active mother, attorney and I have a black belt in karate. I blame my fillings and I am begging the FDA to get rid of them."" While others testified that mercury in their fillings caused such health problems as loss of memory, impaired vision, miscarriages and paralysis, many dental professionals asked that amalgam fillings remain. Addressing the board, Dr. Vincent Mayher, a former president of the Academy of General Dentistry, said public accusations that dentists force patients to receive amalgam fillings is exaggerated. ""It's Inflammatory. No dentist I know of forces a patient at any time to get amalgam fillings these days, especially pregnant women and little children."" Mayher testified . Andrew Read Fuller, a dental student at UCLA and member of the American Student Dental Association, noted there is no scientific data that amalgam fillings cause the problems some attribute to them, and said that, as a future dentist, he would use amalgam fillings on any of his patients as well as himself. ""In the absence of new evidence there is no reason to question the FDA's decision."" Fuller said. Yet some dentists did say they would avoid using amalgam fillings because of numerous public reports of mercury poisoning. ""I always wondered why we were told by the (American Dental Association) to be careful when disposing of mercury. If it's so dangerous to the environment, why not my patients?"" asked Dr. Stephen Markus, a dentist in the Philadelphia area. The committee also recommended that the FDA come up with models that could be used to look at the effects of mercury vapor exposure from dental fillings. And when designing these models, it said, the agency should take into consideration age, health history and physical makeup of individuals. There was also discussion that more data needs to be looked at to come up with stronger models, especially those based on younger children and unborn fetuses. More information on amalgam fillings should be posted for both for patients and dentists, the committee said. It also noted the FDA's biomarker using urine to detect mercury exposure is not perfect but is the best available for adults. Members also noted that more updated data is needed before the agency can make stronger guidelines on amalgam fillings. Although the committee's recommendations will go to the FDA board for consideration, the board does not have to follow them. Traditionally, however, it does.","Advisory panel recommends re-evaluation of mercury in dental fillings .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of Vice, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. Motherboard.tv is Vice's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology. The reports, which are being produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- You're on the Internet. What does that mean? Most likely, it means one of a handful of telecommunications providers is middle-manning your information from point A to point B. Fire off an e-mail or a tweet, broadcast a live stream or upload video to YouTube, and you're relying on vast networks of fiber optic cables deep underground and undersea, working with satellites high above, to move your data around the world, and to bring the world to your fingertips. It's an infrastructure largely out of sight and mind. AT&T, Level 3, Hurricane Electric, Tata Indicom -- to most these are simply invisible magicians performing the act of getting one online and kicking. To many open-source advocates, however, these are a few of the big, dirty names responsible for what they see as the Web's rapid consolidation. The prospect of an irreparably centralized Internet, a physical Internet in the hands of a shrinking core of so-called Tier 1 transit networks, keeps Isaac Wilder up at night. Wilder is the 21-year-old co-founder of the Free Network Foundation. Motherboard, VICE's science and technology offshoot, first caught up with Wilder at Zuccotti Park during the fledgling days of Occupy Wall Street. The Kansas City native seemed to be running on little sleep. He'd gone hoarse from chanting relentlessly over the first three days of a populist movement that would soon sweep the country and the world. But there was an undeniable urgency and excitement when Wilder told us about the efforts of the FNF, a non-profit, peer-to-peer communications initiative striving to liberate the global Internet from corporate and governmental interference. It all sounded lofty and arcane and way, way over our heads. But Wilder seemed committed enough to his drop in the bucket of global revolution, which comes in the form of nine-foot-tall Freedom Towers that beam out free, secure Wi-Fi to occupied sites and underserviced communities, that we wanted to hear more. See the rest of Free the Network at Motherboard.tv. If the argument for mesh networking, a sort of pirate radio Internet scheme that allows people to talk to one another online through no middle man, is that a centralized 'Net lends itself to the sort of surveillance and censorship that, however futile, strokes the Internet kill switch of science fiction, is there a way to circumvent that system altogether? Is there a way to build a new network from the bottom up? To occupy a fresh Internet outside the existing confines of the Web? Or is that all just the stuff of ideological fantasy? To check the pulse of the Internet -- and to get a feel for what life's like in the digital nerve center of what's arguably the first fully Web-fueled social movement in America -- Motherboard has been following Wilder and Tyrone Greenfield, communications director for the Free Network Foundation, for the past half year. Through the thick of Occupy marches, in squats and test-lab offices, on rooftops and all places in between, we saw Wilder, Greenfield and the FNF building and perfecting their Towers and their humble, cooperatively owned, physical Internet. We even broke a story that popped off on the Internet in the immediate wake of the New York Police Department's November 17 raid on Zuccotti Park. We traveled with Wilder to a Department of Sanitation garage shortly after he was released from a 36-hour stint in jail. He was looking for things lost in the early morning sweep of Occupy's epicenter: cash, his backpack and laptop, Zuccotti's Freedom Tower. What he found next to a wet heap of clothing and tents were a number of laptops splayed in rows. They appeared mangled and snarled. One was even stripped of its back casing. Whether Occupy's laptops were purposefully destroyed, or merely crunched under the hydraulic mash of a Sanitation garbage truck, remains unclear. To be sure, after the incident we contacted the NYPD, who forwarded us to Sanitation. Sanitation was tasked with hauling away all the abandoned property from Zuccotti to an off-site garage, where demonstrators were later allowed to rummage for their belongings. A Sanitation representative told Motherboard there had been no directive to destroy property, but that he wasn't surprised to hear that some items, including laptops, had maybe been mishandled or misplaced. In the end, what we came up with is a short documentary called Free the Network. It's a story about big dreams and cloudy missions, about complex affiliations and what happens when a DIY hack-tech movement confronts the force of the state. But beyond that, it's a story about the incredibly high stakes of living networked in today's world. We all have skin in this game. Remember: You're on the Internet.","VICE catches up with Isaac Wilder, founder of the Free Network Foundation .

"(CNN) -- A French prosecutor investigating a ski accident in which former world champion racing driver Michael Schumacher was seriously injured said Wednesday that speed was not an important factor. Schumacher has been in a medically induced coma for the past 10 days and has undergone two surgeries since the December 29 accident. His doctors say he is in stable but critical condition. Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, speaking at a news conference in Albertville, said the investigation had made progress but could still take several weeks to complete. ""Speed is not a particularly important element for us in that inquiry,"" he said. Police investigator Stephane Bozon said it was not possible to estimate Schumacher's speed in terms of kilometers per hour, ""but this was the speed of a very good skier on a slope which was not very steep."" Another investigator, Benoit Vinneman, said Schumacher was traveling at ""a normal speed for an experienced skier."" Quincy ruled out problems with Schumacher's skis, which he said were almost new. The piste, or ski run, also appeared to be correctly marked according to French standards, he said. Family ask media for privacy . Schumacher hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while skiing in an area between two marked pistes, the prosecutor said, which catapulted him face first onto another rock. Schumacher ended up 9 meters (30 feet) from the edge of the piste, he said. Investigators have begun studying footage filmed on a small camera attached to Schumacher's helmet, but further analysis is needed, Quincy said. The video is only two minutes long and has a very limited field of vision, he said. He said experts may be able to use it to determine Schumacher's precise position in relation to the edge of the piste and possibly the speed at which he was traveling at the time of the accident. Why induced comas help injured brains . Investigators are talking to family members, witnesses and others in connection with the Schumacher inquiry, he said. The investigation is no different from those carried out in other serious accidents on the slopes, Quincy added. There are about 50 such a year in the Albertville area, he said. Schumacher is a formidable figure in Formula One, and his plight has attracted global interest and an outpouring of support from the sport's fans. However, his family wants the media to keep its distance and appealed Tuesday for privacy. ""Please support us in our common fight with Michael,"" Corinna Schumacher, the wife of the race car driver, said in a statement. ""It is important to me that you (media) relieve the doctors and the hospital so that they can work in peace. I kindly ask you to trust their statements and leave the clinic. Please also let our family in peace."" Schumacher is the most successful driver in Formula One history, driving for the Benetton and Ferrari teams and claiming a record seven world titles and 91 grand prix wins.","NEW: Investigator: Schumacher was traveling at ""a normal speed for an experienced skier""

"(CNN) -- Clean water is vital to every single American. Families should be able to turn on the tap and have safe drinking water for their children, vacationers expect healthy rivers for fishing and swimming, and businesses need a steady supply of clean water to make products. The administration is proposing a clean water rule to better protect America's most vulnerable waters -- the streams and wetlands that feed our larger rivers, lakes and bays. These bodies of water were clearly protected by the Clean Water Act when it was passed more than 40 years ago. Unfortunately, two convoluted Supreme Court decisions, actions of the previous administration and inaction by Congress have left these water bodies in a legal limbo. This poses a threat to all of us. Without this common-sense new rule, about 2 million miles of streams and 20 million acres of wetlands are at risk. These bodies of water may seem small, but they form part of the drinking water supplies for more than one third of Americans. Clean, healthy waters are also the engines behind a strong outdoor recreation economy. Nationally, hunters and anglers spent $90 billion in 2011 and wildlife watchers spent an additional $55 billion, according to the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. These dollars translate into economic vitality -- filling beds in hotels and making the cash registers ring in restaurants and sporting goods stores. All told, hunting and angling expenditures contribute about $200 billion to the economy each year. Like many Americans, I treasure our waters, and I am proud that I am able to manage my properties to preserve their natural streams, wetlands and grasslands. On my Ladder Ranch in southern New Mexico, you can see the importance of small streams in action. These tiny streams, in a very arid area, support a diversity of animal and plant life that make this place special. In New Mexico, 55% of all vertebrate species depend on wetland habitats, and nearly 25% of the threatened or endangered species in the state live in wetlands. It feels good to do my part to protect and restore small streams and riparian areas where I can. But water flows downhill. In order to ensure we have safe drinking water for all, communities upstream and downstream must work together. I applaud the administration's initiative to restore Clean Water Act protections to these vulnerable waters and to keep them from pollution, and I urge the President to follow through and finish the effort this year. I urge members of Congress to support the Environmental Protection Agency's public process to clarify and restore these protections -- a public process called for by the U.S Supreme Court. Our waters have been threatened by this uncertain status quo for more than a decade. We can't wait any longer. Now is the time to ensure the Clean Water Act effectively protects the water our children drink -- and the businesses that keep our economy strong. Poll after poll shows that a strong majority of Americans value clean drinking water. I write now to add my voice to the chorus demanding clean water.","Ted Turner: Clean water is vital, but sources of our rivers and lakes were not protected .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a tropical storm in the southern Philippines has reached more than 900, an official with the country's disaster agency said Monday. Benito Ramos of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said the toll stood at 927. The Philippines Red Cross reported a lower death toll, at 713. Tropical Storm Washi affected more than 167,000 people, the council said in a report Monday. About 88,000 people were being served at evacuation centers. President Beningo Aquino plans to visit the region Tuesday. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement Monday expressing ""deep condolences for the tremendous loss of life and devastation."" He said the United States ""stands ready to assist the Philippine people and government should humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts be needed."" The Red Cross noted that hundreds are missing after entire villages were swept away. The stench of death permeated the air as aid workers scrambled to help survivors. Military and disaster officials said the vast majority of the dead were found in the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro, many of them swept away as they were sleeping. Water-logged bodies from washed-away villages floated at the shoreline on the northwestern coast of Mindanao island. Five people were killed in a landslide, but virtually all the others died in flash flooding after Tropical Storm Washi, which is called Sendong locally. Survivors in the hardest-hit areas are contending with no electricity or clean drinking water. One woman in Cagayan de Oro collected murky brown floodwater in a bucket, just meters away from where a destroyed vehicle was submerged. Flash flooding overnight Friday, following 10 hours of rain, fueled the devastation. As much as 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell within 24 hours in some areas. December generally brings about 60 millimeters of rain (a little over 2 inches) to the region, CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported.","The country's disaster council says the death toll is 927 .

"(CNN) -- The message was cryptic. Two words. No context, no punctuation, just: ""inviting coworkers"" But that short statement proved to be enough to launch a global phenomenon that has launched careers, reunited long-lost relatives, and even, some would argue, topple dictators. It was the first tweet. Since Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey posted it on March 21, 2006, Twitter has registered nearly 200 million users who now post more than a billion tweets every week. Dorsey has spent the last few days tweeting a timeline of sorts, sharing what he was doing just before the big launch. On Sunday, he tweeted: ""5 yrs ago today, the eve of launching twttr to the company. Moving from @Biz, @florian & me, to all of our peers using it. Nervous. #twttr"" His anxiety certainly paid off. Since its launch, Twitter has played a role in a wide range of headline-making events, from the Egyptian revolution to Charlie Sheen's battle with CBS. It's also become a business tool, with many major companies now using accounts to advertise deals and encourage word-of-mouth marketing. Twitter's importance in communication was made plain during the moments after Japan's earthquake and tsunami this month. Twitter says it set a record of 6,939 tweets per second immediately after the 9.0-magnitude quake struck on March 11, and 177 million tweets went out as the day wore on. It took three years, two months and a day for Twitter to get to one billion tweets. The site now averages 140 million tweets a day. Twitter is a privately-held company, so its finances are not made public. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that suitors were valuing it at $8 to $10 billion.","The first tweet was posted by co-founder Jack Dorsey on March 21, 2006 .

"(CNN) -- A Jackson, Mississippi, high school basketball coach is accused of whipping students for ""failing to run basketball plays correctly,"" according to a federal lawsuit filed this week by three students. Coach Marlon Dorsey acknowledged he ""paddled"" students, but he defended it as a way to ""save these young men from the destruction of self,"" the court filing said. A school district spokeswoman and its attorney would not confirm whether Dorsey has been suspended, but he has not shown up to teach or coach at Murrah High School in recent days, according to the students' lawyer. The suspension was apparently for 28 days without pay, attorney Lisa Ross said. Dorsey is still employed with the district, spokeswoman Peggy Hampton said late Thursday afternoon. The students are still attending classes and are playing on the boy's varsity basketball team, Ross said. One senior was whipped ""daily and sometimes more than once daily by striking him three times across his buttocks each time"" with a ""five to ten pound weight belt,"" the suit said. One beating was captured on video, the suit said. Jackson School Superintendent Lonnie Edwards Sr., who viewed the video, said it ""certainly shows a reflection of inappropriate behavior."" In a Thursday statement, Edwards indicated the matter has been resolved. ""In taking action, the school district considered the seriousness of the circumstances, prevailing policy, input and concerns from parents and the athletes involved, and Coach Dorsey's overall employee performance record. Since this is a personnel matter, no further details will be provided to the public by the school district. We do not want to violate Coach Dorsey's privacy rights. However, you may be assured that this situation has been addressed."" The three students were beaten for ""no legitimate purpose whatsoever,"" but Dorsey accused them of ""failing to run basketball plays correctly,"" the suit said. ""He told them they had the choice to accept the licks without complaining to anyone or forfeit the opportunity to play basketball for their high school team,"" it said. The coach verbally abused basketball players, calling them ""sissy,"" ""bitch,"" ""wimp,"" and ""soft,"" it said. Dorsey has not commented to CNN, but the lawsuit filing included a statement issued by the coach after the whipping allegations hit the news media. ""I paddled my students... today, some of [sic] students have lost pride in their school and in their (sic) selves. Students are disrespecting teachers, administrators and other students by stealing cell phones, leaving off campus without permission, disrupting classroom teaching time, late for class and not following dress codes by wearing the pants on their butts and house shoes to school and on-court behavior. I took it upon myself to save these young men from the destruction of self and what society has accepted and become silent to the issues our students are facing on a daily basis."" Principal Freddrick Murray is also named as a defendant. The suit claims that students and parents told him about the whippings, but he failed to investigate or stop them. The school district's website says corporal punishment is prohibited. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","Three high school students file lawsuit against coach .

"(CNN) -- Davy Jones, whose charming grin and British accent won the hearts of millions of fans on the 1960s television series ""The Monkees,"" died Wednesday, according to the Martin County, Florida, sheriff's office. He was 66. A witness told authorities he was with Jones in Indiantown, Florida, when Jones ""began to complain of not feeling well and having trouble breathing,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. Jones was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said. A Martin County law enforcement source with knowledge of the case said Jones apparently suffered a heart attack. Laurie Jacobson, whose company Living Legends LTD often booked Jones for Hollywood nostalgia shows, spoke with him two days ago about several new bookings. ""He was a vegetarian, and there was not an ounce of fat on the guy,"" Jacobson said. ""He lived on the beach in Florida and ran miles every morning. This is the last person I expected this to happen to. He couldn't have been in better shape."" The diminutive vocalist and actor sang lead on the musical group's hits such as ""Daydream Believer"" and ""A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You."" Besides Jones, The Monkees included band members Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and Michael Nesmith. The pop group was created to star in an NBC sitcom and capitalize on the Beatles' teenybopper popularity. ""The Monkees"" TV series premiered in the fall of 1966. Share your memories of Davy Jones on iReport . In terms of musical popularity, the project succeeded beyond anyone's expectations, with the group notching a handful of No. 1 songs (including ""I'm a Believer,"" Billboard's top song of 1967) and four No. 1 albums. The group, which was dubbed the ""prefab four"" by critics, rebelled against its management in an effort to take control of its musical career. The move worked to an extent -- band members, who had generally been replaced by session men on Monkees recordings, were allowed to play their own instruments and contribute songs -- but coincided with a decline in the Monkees' popularity. NBC canceled the TV series ""The Monkees"" after just two seasons, and the band lasted for only one more year after that. Though the TV show was never a huge ratings hit, its knockabout, Marx Brothers-style comedy -- inspired, to an extent, by the loopier sequences in the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night"" -- gained fans and followers, reigniting the band's popularity when MTV reran the show in the mid-'80s. Demand for Jones at nostalgia shows was brisk, Jacobson said. ""He's been really busy,"" she said. ""He's toured with his band, singing as well. He loved to pick up these little autograph shows. He loved the fans, he loved spending time with his fans. He often got on stage and performed at these shows. The lines for him were always out the door."" The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said flowers in honor of Jones would be placed on The Monkees' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday afternoon. ""That David has stepped beyond my view causes me the sadness that it does many of you,"" Nesmith posted on his Facebook page Wednesday. ""I will miss him, but I won't abandon him to mortality ... David's spirit and soul live well in my heart, among all the lovely people, who remember with me the good times, and the healing times, that were created for so many, including us."" ""His talent will be much missed; his gifts will be with us always,"" said fellow Monkee Peter Tork. ""My deepest sympathy to Jessica and the rest of his family."" Beatle Ringo Starr issued a short statement: ""God bless Davy. Peace & love to his family, Ringo."" David Thomas Jones was born December 30, 1945, in Manchester, England. He was already famous in his home country when he joined the Monkees. He had starred in the musical ""Oliver!"" on the London stage as the Artful Dodger and was nominated for a Tony for his performance on Broadway, according to a biography on a Monkees fan site. Indeed, he got a taste of the Beatles' popularity when the ""Oliver!"" cast appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" on February 9, 1964 -- the date of the Beatles' first appearance. After the Monkees broke up, Jones enjoyed occasional acting roles, including a guest spot on an episode of ""The Brady Bunch"" and appearances in ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" and ""The Brady Bunch Movie."" When he wasn't singing -- he participated in several Monkees reunions over the years -- he was devoted to owning and racing horses. Jones was married three times. He is survived by his third wife, Jessica Pacheco, and four daughters from his two previous marriages. He told Britain's Daily Mail last year that he used to be 5 feet 4 inches tall, ""but I've lost an inch."" He posted photographs of his horses, his grandchildren and himself on his blog, ""Keep up with Jones,"" sometimes also posting messages to fans. ""I wrote some time ago that not everyone has dreams and hopes that come true,"" he wrote in a January 2011 message. ""Mine have. ""Regrets, yes -- if you don't have them you're a fool.

"(CNN) -- His old rival Tiger Woods is missing the Masters, but three-time champion Phil Mickelson should be teeing off at Augusta next week after allaying fears about his fitness. The veteran golfer pulled out during last week's Texas Open with a muscle problem, having missed the Farmers Insurance Open in late January with a back issue. However, the 43-year-old raised hopes of claiming a career sixth major title after coming through Thursday's opening round at the Houston Open in good shape. ""I feel a lot better,"" Mickelson told the PGA Tour website. ""I travel with a light therapy machine, and I got on it right away, and I think that made a world of difference as far as expediting the healing process to where it doesn't hurt anymore. ""It just feels sore like I was working out, as opposed to kind of a painful experience."" Mickelson, the 2011 Houston winner, carded a bogey-free four-under-par 68 to be tied for 18th in a group including fellow veterans Ernie Els, Davis Love, Retief Goosen and 2012 U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson. They were three shots behind leaders Bill Haas -- the PGA Tour's 2011 FedEx Cup champion -- and fellow American Charley Hoffman, seeking his first victory since 2010. World No. 7 Rory McIlroy, another Masters title contender, was tied for 59th after a 70. On Tuesday and Wednesday, fifth-ranked Mickelson spent time practicing at Augusta, where he wore the victor's fabled Green Jacket in 2004, 2006 and 2010. ""I was able to spend more time with short irons, chipping, putting as opposed to driving the ball, but even that was pretty good today,"" he said.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The prospect of being blown up makes defusing landmines dangerous work, particularly in Afghanistan. But that is just one of many dangers that explosives workers face there. On Tuesday, armed men abducted 68 mine defusers who were on their way to clear explosives in the western province of Herat, on Iran's border, a spokesman for the mine disposal organization that employs them said. Eight of the abducted were able to flee, said Dr. Farid Homayoun of Britain's Halo Trust. Afghan security forces have surrounded the area, and Halo Trust is trying to enlist the help of local tribal elders to secure the release of the remaining 60. The organization has 150 mine defusing teams and employs more than 3,000 Afghans, it says on its website. It also destroys other munitions. Since the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, multiple warring parties have laid landmines, bringing the total number of mines to as many as 640,000 Halo Trust reports. The kidnappers first took the explosives workers -- all Afghan natives -- their vehicles and their equipment to a village. Then the abductors forced the captives to go into the mountains, Homayoun said. No one, including the Taliban, has taken responsibility for the kidnapping, Homayoun said, and no ransom demands have been made. Local police are also working to free them, said Herat province Police Chief Abdul Rauf Ahmadi said. He said the mine clearers traveled to the area without informing area security officials, who could have guarded them in the remote, rugged and insecure region.","The landmine crew of Afghan natives was on its way to clear areas of Herat province .

So far, authorities said, there is no evidence that this virus can pass from person to person. That doesn't mean it can't happen later. ""If limited person-to-person transmission is demonstrated in the future, this really will not be surprising,"" Keiji Fukuda, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for health, security and the environment, told a news conference Wednesday in Beijing. WHO: H7N9 virus 'one of the most lethal so far' It's dangerous and deadly to humans . The virus appears to be transmitted more easily from poultry to humans than H5N1, Fukuda said, referring to the strain responsible for the outbreak between 2004 and 2007, which claimed 332 lives. ""This is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses that we have seen so far,"" he said. The H7N9 strain was never known to infect people until March. Before then, it was only found in birds. If the virus does start to spread easily between people, it could trigger a pandemic. ""This is a serious public health situation and it's possible that a pandemic could start if this virus were to change to spread easily between people,"" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website. ""CDC is preparing for that possibility."" New bird flu well-adapted to infect people . There's still a lot of unknowns . It's not clear why this virus strain is infecting humans now, and the source of the infection is unknown. Scientists have analyzed the genes of the H7N9 viruses and found that they show signs indicating they can adapt to grow in mammals. It appears they can bind to mammalian cells and grow at temperatures near mammals' normal body temperatures, which is lower than that of birds, WHO said. There is no vaccine available, but WHO said efforts are underway in other countries after Chinese officials said international help would be needed. The CDC said researchers there are working on a vaccine candidate virus. Cooking poultry can kill the virus before you eat it . In normal cooking temperatures -- so all parts of the meat reach at least 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) with no ""pink"" -- the virus would be inactivated, including in poultry and game birds. Generally, eating raw meat is discouraged anyway, as doing so can lead to a variety of foodborne illnesses. You should not, however, eat diseased animals or animals known to have died from diseases. No travel restrictions; low U.S. risk . The CDC is not advising against traveling to China, but travelers who go there should refrain from touching birds and other animals and wash their hands often. There is currently no incidence of the virus in the United States, but the most likely scenario for it to get there would be through a person traveling from China. The risk to persons in the United States is low, the CDC said. There are no tests available at pharmacies or doctors' offices to distinguish this flu quickly from any other flu virus, the CDC said. However, there is a sophisticated test to detect the H7N9 virus in particular, which takes at least four hours. ""Anyone with fever, coughing or shortness of breath within 10 days of traveling to China should see a doctor and tell the doctor about the recent travel to China,"" the CDC said on its website.","The new strain of H7N9 bird flu is dangerous and deadly to humans .
There's no evidence of human-to-human transmission, but it could happen in the future .
There are currently no travel restrictions as a result of this virus ."
"San Diego (CNN) -- Every few years, I reassess how I feel about Mexican-Americans who wave Mexican flags. Much of it has to do with who is doing the waving and under what circumstances. In 2006, I wrote a column saying it was a bad idea for immigration reform advocates to wave Mexican flags as they marched through U.S. cities such as Phoenix, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles. It's illogical to show your allegiance to one country while demanding accommodation from another. But in 2007, I penned another column after attending a Luis Miguel concert in Las Vegas where fans of the Mexican singer unfurled Mexican flags. Nothing wrong with that, I concluded. It's all about context. There is a big difference between a political protest and a concert. Now, thanks to U.S. Olympic medalist Leo Manzano, and what I consider to be the misguided and ill-mannered way he chose to celebrate his silver medal in the 1500-meters final, I get the chance to think through the subject of flag-waving once again. After Manzano finished his race and secured his medal, he did what athletes typically do at the Olympics. He held up his country's flag -- the Stars and Stripes. The 27-year-old was born in Mexico, but the United States is his country now. His father migrated here illegally from the city of Dolores Hidalgo. Manzano was brought here when he was 4. Like most immigrants, they came in search of greater opportunity. And they found it -- for themselves, and their children. That little boy eventually became a U.S. citizen. And then, after a lot of hard work and thousands of hours of training, he got the chance to represent his country and compete in the Olympics. And, to put the cherry on the sundae, he actually wins a silver medal. The last time an American won a medal of any kind in the 1500 meters was 44 years ago. You can't help but be proud of Manzano and the country that allowed him the opportunity to fulfill his potential. So why did Manzano carry two flags with him on his victory lap? As the world looked on, he held up both the U.S. flag and the Mexican flag. Not a good look. And not a good idea. Manzano posted messages on Twitter throughout the competition -- in Spanish and English. After his victory, he tweeted, ""Silver medal, still felt like I won! Representing two countries USA and Mexico!"" That's funny. I only saw one set of letters on his jersey: USA. Later, he said to the media that he was honored to represent the United States and Mexico. I realize that, for many of my fellow Mexican-Americans, the image of Manzano waving two flags is no big thing. And for many Americans who are Mexican-born, it's actually a great thing. Both camps might even find the gesture charming -- albeit, for different reasons. Most Mexican-Americans I know would need a whole team of therapists to sort out their views on culture, national identity, ethnic pride and their relationship with Mother Mexico. They're the orphans of the Southwest -- too Mexican for the Americans, too American for the Mexicans. Their positive reaction to the photo has less to do with Manzano than with their own sense of displacement. Many Mexicans who came to the United States -- particularly those who came as professionals or became professionals once they got here -- look to Mexico with a mixture of affection and guilt. They romanticize what they left behind and find it easier to love the country from hundreds or thousands of miles away. They may live in the United States, but many of them still consider themselves children of Mexico -- the kind who run away from home. For both groups, the fact that Manzano, who holds dual citizenship, made a decision to show off the flags of both countries was a kind of signal to the people of Mexico that this accomplished young man hadn't forgotten where he came from. For some, that concept warms the heart. But the image didn't warm my heart. It upset my stomach. Understand, I've been called a Mexican separatist, a racist who hates anyone who isn't Mexican or Mexican-American, someone who is obsessed with his ethnicity. In fact, I can't remember the last time someone accused me of not being proud of being Mexican or Mexican-American. And in the past 20 years, I've written hundreds of thousands of words in defense of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. That said, the photo bothered me. Some people will insist that this is Manzano's choice to make, that it was his sweat and sacrifice that got him to London, and this was his victory to celebrate however he saw fit. Those people are wrong. They're focused on the individual. But the last thing the Olympics is about is the individual. It's about being part of a team -- the U.S. Olympic team. It's about national pride, not ego. Manzano wasn't there to compete for himself but to represent his country. All he had to do was decide which country that was. He chose not to choose. What am I missing? Where were the Italian-American athletes waving the Italian flag, or the Irish-Americans waving the Irish flag? I didn't see that. I remember that, in 1992, Mexican-American boxer Oscar De La Hoya held up both the U.S. and Mexican flags after winning a gold medal in Barcelona. But that was largely symbolic since De La Hoya was born in the United States. He wasn't an immigrant caught between two countries. Leo, con todo respeto (with all due respect), you should be proud of your accomplishment. You deserve it. But when you're an Olympic athlete, you don't get to have your cake and eat it, too. Sooner or later, you have to choose which country you're going to represent. And you did. You made that choice, when you put on the jersey for Team USA. It wasn't unlike the choice your parents made when they chose the United States over Mexico a quarter century ago. They voted with their feet. It would be nice if you haven't left your heart behind. This country took you in during your hour of need. Now in your moment of glory, which country deserves your respect -- the one that offered nothing to your parents and forced them to leave or the one that took you all in and gave you the opportunity to live out your dreams? The answer should be obvious. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Leo Manzano waved both U.S. and Mexico flags after winning in the Olympics .
Ruben Navarrette: It was not a good idea for Manzano to carry two flags .
He says Manzano should have been clear about which country he represented .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York City is on course to mark the fewest homicides since records have been kept, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced Wednesday. The city is expected to fall below 500 murders in 2007, the lowest level for any year since 1963, when comparable information on homicides was first collected, Bloomberg said at a news conference. ""At the end of 2002, for the first time in four decades, murders in New York City fell below 600, and we were able to hold them below 600 for the next four years,"" Bloomberg said. ""Today, with just five days of the year remaining, it appears that we have another historic achievement within our reach."" Bloomberg said decreases in major felony crimes were recorded across every crime category and in all five boroughs in 2007, marking the seventeenth straight year in which crime has gone down. Since 2001, overall major felony crime has decreased 26 percent citywide, according to New York Police Department statistics.  Watch how the city achieved success » . Declines in domestic violence-related homicides and transit crime particularly stand out, Bloomberg told reporters. Domestic violence-related murders dropped a record 36 percent this year, the mayor said. The decline coincides with an effort by NYPD that doubled visits of specially trained detectives to households where domestic violence had occurred, officials noted. Crime in the subway system in 2007 fell 13 percent below the record low numbers recorded last year, despite subway ridership that's at an all-time high. Officials name ""Operation Impact"" as the prime reason for the decline in crime. The NYPD effort focuses on problem people and places, Kelly said. It places significant numbers of uniformed officers in small areas of precincts, where crime rates are relatively high. Given the success of Operation Impact, the NYPD will assign all of this year's Police Academy graduates to the program, Kelly said. Officials also credited an improved police and community partnership for the overall decline in crime. ""We are not the same New York that we were in 1990, a year when more than 2,000 people were murdered,"" Bloomberg said. ""We're also not the same city we were in 2001, when many predicted that our crime-fighting gains would soon be a point of diminishing returns.""

"(CNN) -- Thailand is no stranger to civil unrest -- just four years ago the same emergency laws brought in this week were used to end political protests that left scores dead and thousands injured. While this year's state of emergency may not differ in substance, it is being projected by the government of Yingluck Shinawatra as different in style. The 60-day clampdown gives the government the power to implement curfews, censor the news media, disperse gatherings and use military force to ""secure order."" Analysts say in this respect it is no different to the law that Suthep Thaugsuban -- a former deputy prime minister who is now leading anti-government protests -- used in 2010 to bring a violent end to months of protests in the capital Bangkok. But this time, the government says it has no plans to crack down on the protesters that have disrupted the capital Bangkok for weeks. Labor Minister Chalerm Yoobamrung, who will oversee the joint operation between the military and the police, told a press conference this week the government would not use weapons and would not attempt to disperse protesters at night. In 2010, the military's attempt to clear protester encampments at night was widely held to have been responsible for the high death toll of around 80 people. The use of the police as a stabilizing force in the deadlock has been widely seen as an attempt by the government to inject a civilian element into the state of emergency. In recent weeks, the government has been praised by foreign governments, including the United States, for its restraint in handling the protests. Despite this, human rights groups fear the state of emergency could boil over if protesters -- who aim to disrupt elections scheduled for February 2 and want to institute an unelected ""people's council"" to run the country ahead of a political overhaul -- ratchet up the pressure. ""This is the same piece of legislation with the same powers,"" Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch told CNN. ""Her (Yingluck Shinawatra) powers are not limited by this."" ""While she says she will not use these powers immediately, it will very much depend on the situation,"" he said. ""If she felt that the protesters were instigating violence to stop the elections, she might use some of these powers. ""Our view is that we're concerned that this (the state of emergency) will be viewed as an escalation by the protesters, but on the other hand governments do have a responsibility to maintain some sense of law and order. ""As long as they do this in a rights-friendly way, I don't think people will complain about it. Everything will swing on what happens next."" While Thailand has said it remains open for business despite the state of emergency, the US State Department issued a travel alert for Thailand this week, warning U.S. citizens of the ""unpredictable and ongoing demonstration activity"" ahead of the elections. According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand, a total of 34 countries and regions have issued travel warnings for Thailand, including China, France, Australia and Japan. The protests have already rattled the nerves of some of Thailand's biggest investors. On Monday, the president of Toyota's Thailand unit Kyoichi Tanada told a press conference the company may reconsider up to 20 billion baht ($609 million) in investment -- and could even cut production -- if political unrest continues. ""For new foreign investors, the political situation may force them to look for opportunity elsewhere. For those that have already invested, like Toyota, we will not go away. But whether we will invest (further) or not, we are not sure."" Thailand is the biggest auto market in Southeast Asia and is a production and export hub for car manufacturers such as Honda Motor Company and Ford. Despite political instability, Thailand has shown formidable economic growth over the past decade and is still attracting foreign investment from small to medium-sized enterprises. In 2010, the medium-sized design company Design World Partnership decided to remain in Bangkok despite having its office windows shot out during the crackdown. ""We have to take the long view. If you look at the view over the past five to ten years the growth in Thailand has been phenomenal,"" Brenton Mauriello, DWP Chief Executive Officer, told CNN. ""Of course it would be better if it wasn't there and in the short-term our business has been affected but it's not catastrophic,"" he said. ""You don't come to a country like Thailand and invest over a three or four-month period -- it's a long-term commitment."" He said that his company was expecting the situation to resolve itself and that by April or May it would be business as usual. ""We are now starting to invest back into Australia,"" said Mauriello, whose company began in Australia, established itself in Thailand in 1994 and and now has nine offices and 450 staff worldwide. ""I think that shows that if we can do it, anyone can.""","Thailand has a long history of civil unrest, with dozens of governments since 1946 .

"(CNN) -- Was it George Zimmerman or Trayvon Martin who screamed for help the night the 17-year-old Martin was shot dead? That could depend on which mother the jury believes. Both Zimmerman's and Martin's mothers expressed no hesitation Friday in separate court appearances as to whose panicked voice is heard screaming during a 911 call from that February 26, 2012, night in Sanford, Florida: Each said it was her son. That contradiction -- with Sybrina Fulton insisting it was her son, Trayvon, who cried out, while Gladys Zimmerman said it was her son, George, who was yelling after being attacked by the teen -- was central to Friday's court proceedings, and central to the second-degree murder case unfolding in central Florida. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty and claimed he shot the teenager in self-defense. The 911 call played twice in court on Friday, his lawyers claim, back up their assertion that it was Martin, and not their client, who was the aggressor. Testifying late Friday afternoon, Gladys Zimmerman said she was sure George was the one yelling. Why? ""Because he's my son."" She answered ""all of the above"" when asked whether she had ever before heard her George Zimmerman laugh loudly or cry out for help. This instance, though, Gladys Zimmerman admits was different. ""I haven't heard him like that before,"" she said as her son wiped away tears in the courtroom. ""The anguish, the way that he is screaming it describes to me anguish, fear, I would say terror."" Contrast that to the very different story offered a few hours earlier by Sybrina Fulton, who was stoic as prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda played the 911 call. When asked whether she recognized the screaming voice, the mother -- who earlier stated that her son was ""in heaven"" -- said it was that of ""Trayvon Benjamin Martin."" Trayvon Martin shooting: Fast Facts . Defense attorney Mark O'Mara followed up by asking her, ""As his mother, there was no doubt it was him screaming?"" She replied: ""Absolutely."" O'Mara then raised the possibility her son, not Zimmerman, was to to blame. ""You certainly hope, as a mom, that your son Trayvon Martin would not have done anything that led to his death, correct?"" he asked. ""What I hoped for,"" said Fulton, ""is that nothing happened and he'd still be here. That's my hope."" Parents' comments pivotal, or do they cancel each other? More than a year ago, the tale of what happened between Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman captured the nation's attention and shone a spotlight on gun laws as well as race -- given that Martin is African-American, while Zimmerman is Hispanic. Moreover, the case prompted some to question Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which gives a person facing a ""presumption of fear of death or great bodily harm"" extra protections should they respond with force instead of retreat. Ultimately, Zimmerman chose not to utilize that specific defense. The trial kicked off nearly two weeks ago with impassioned opening arguments. The prosecution suggested Zimmerman, whom they painted as a neighborhood watch volunteer who overstepped his bounds, had ""profiled"" Martin because he was black. They called to the stand the 911 dispatcher who told Zimmerman not to follow Martin, though he did anyway. Then there were crime scene and autopsy photos. And of course, there was the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, who said she'd been on the phone with her friend Trayvon Martin in the minutes before his death. She testified that she'd heard Martin call out, ""Why are you following me for?"" and then say, ""Get off,"" before their call was cut off. Jeantel has been described as the defense's star witness. That may still be true. But in many ways, Friday was the most emotional and potentially pivotal day in the trial to date. O'Mara isn't disputing that latter assertion. He told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday night that ""once the jury decides who was screaming for help (on the 911 call), if they can, I think everything else falls in line."" Speaking to CNN, O'Mara says he doesn't dispute that Fulton genuinely believes it was her son's voice. But so does Gladys Zimmerman of her own son, the defense lawyer says, arguing that ""all the other evidence would suggest"" that the screaming voice is indeed that of George Zimmerman. And even if not everyone sees it that say, O'Mara opined, it's possible each woman's testimony may cancel each other out. Opinion: Can Zimmerman win over the jurors? ""I think the jury is going to look at this and say both of these women just have to live with the belief that it is, in fact, their son,"" O'Mara said. ""And they are going to make a determination not based on what each mom says, but on the other evidence."" Daryl Parks, a lawyer for Martin's family, didn't entirely disagree -- telling CNN that he didn't think the case ultimately ""is going to hinge on whose voice you're hearing."" The six jurors, all women, will weigh both mother's credibility, others' testimony and a host of evidence. When all the testimony and presentations are over, Parks said, he expects they'll agree on a verdict: guilty. He said, ""At the end of the day, we do not believe that George Zimmerman had to pull out a gun and shoot Trayvon Martin in the heart."" Defense challenges medical examiner . Sybrina Fulton and Gladys Zimmerman weren't the only members of their respective families to take the stand Friday. Jahvaris Fulton, Martin's older brother, testified Friday morning about the voice on the 911 call. The 22-year-old college student said he was certain that it was his brother, even as he added that he had ""heard him (Martin) yell"" before, but ""not like that."" Hours later, it was Jorge Meza's turn. He testified right after Zimmerman's mother. A deputy sheriff in Orange County -- which is just south of Sanford, both in central Florida -- he's also George Zimmerman's uncle. He said he originally heard the 911 call on TV and without any further information or prompts, immediately recognized his nephew's voice. The other highlight of Friday's court proceedings was the testimony of Voluscia and Seminole County associate medical examiner Shiping Bao. In Zimmerman's trial, it's a jury of millions . Bao said the muzzle of Zimmerman's gun was likely in loose contact with Martin's clothing, indicating that the teen was shot at close range. In testimony that at times turned contentious, Bao also said Martin did not die right away after the gunshot. ""I believe he was alive for one to 10 minutes after he was shot. His heart was bleeding until there was no blood left,"" the medical examiner said as autopsy photos lingered on a courtroom screen, adding that Martin was ""suffering (and) in pain."" ""There is no chance he could survive. Zero."" During a contentious cross-examination, defense attorney Don West expressed doubts about the condition of Martin's body and clothing when it was examined, noting the victim was not moved from the scene for about three hours. Bao would not confirm that timeline -- despite West's repeated attempts to have him do so -- because he said he was not there. As the two disputed Bao's ability to establish a timeline, Judge Nelson interjected, telling the witness to ""please stop speaking so Mr. West can ask the next question."" Prepared notes that Bao was reading from also drew West's attention. When asked about them, Bao said, ""I typed out potential answers to your potential questions."" Bao objected to sharing his notes, telling the judge that they were private and no one had seen them. Despite his protests, Nelson allowed the papers to be copied and reviewed by lawyers from both sides. The notes revealed that Bao had changed his mind about a couple of issues: the amount of time Martin survived after being shot and whether the marijuana in the teenager's system was enough to affect him. West argued that the prosecution knew about these changes but didn't tell the defense. But Bao insisted that he did not tell anyone that he'd changed his opinion. The defense attorney pressed Bao, too, on the collection of Martin's clothes and scraping of his fingernails. The medical examiner, though, said he couldn't remember each detail and that he'd trusted that his technicians properly followed procedures. Late in Friday's court proceedings, O'Mara made his pitch for acquittal -- arguing that Zimmerman acted in self-defense; there was no direct evidence of ill will, hatred or spite surrounding Martin's killing; and that it was still unclear who could be heard screaming on the 911 call. There is ""no other reasonable hypothesis"" for what happened, the defense attorney argued, besides self-defense. The judge, though, denied the motion -- after which, around 5 p.m., the prosecution formally rested its case.

"(CNN) -- Syria has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filling and production facilities, and all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites have been placed under seal, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Thursday. ""So far we have good, measurable and demonstrative progress and we have constructive collaboration,"" Head of the U.N./OPCW mission Sigrid Kaag told CNN. The watchdog body's announcement of the facilities' destruction means that the first deadline has been met in an ambitious program to eliminate the country's entire chemical weapons stockpile by the middle of next year. The joint United Nations-OPCW mission visited 21 out of 23 sites, the OPCW statement said, and 39 of the 41 facilities at those sites. The remaining two sites were too dangerous for the inspectors to go to, it said, but Syria had declared those sites as abandoned. The chemical weapons equipment there was moved to other sites, which were inspected. The OPCW said it was ""now satisfied that it has verified -- and seen destroyed -- all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."" Additionally, the OPCW says all of the chemical weapons at the inspected sites were placed under seal during the inspectors' visits and Kaag is confident that they are now tamper-proof. However, some observers say questions remain. Because OPCW inspectors were unable to visit two of the sites, the watchdog ""is only certifying functional destruction of Syrian self-declared equipment from self-declared sites,"" David Reeths, director of aerospace and defense consulting for IHS Jane's, said. The OPCW announcement is ""a significant milestone"" -- and it's ""remarkable"" that the OPCW was able to destroy the equipment in a conflict zone -- but Syria still has its stockpile of functioning chemical weapons, ""so destruction of the production equipment has little to no impact on their immediate capabilities. Only after those weapons have been destroyed or removed from Syrian control will the state be demilitarized,"" said Reeths, a former treaty compliance officer for the U.S. military. Other concerns are that the OPCW didn't have enough time after the declaration to ""look for inconsistencies with their own intelligence"" and whether the Syrian regime can be trusted to disclose all of its capabilities, he said. ""Syria likely assesses there is little chance that lack of candor in their declaration will be discovered in the short-term,"" Reeths said. Likewise, a senior official with access to the latest intelligence said the United States continues to watch closely behind the scenes for any indication of undeclared material moving to either Alawite enclaves, or across the border to Iran. Syria's government is led by President Bashar al-Assad, a member of the Shiite offshoot Alawite sect. ""Our assessment is it is unlikely Syria will declare and/or destroy all of their chemical weapons,"" the official said. Meanwhile, Foreign Policy's The Cable, reported that Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem has asked international inspectors to spare 12 of its chemical weapons factories so that they can be converted into civilian chemical facilities. The request was made in a confidential letter to Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the OPCW, according to The Cable. ""There's a real concern that the Syrians might be trying to preserve some of their chemical weapons capabilities,"" said a U.S. official in response to the story. The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. 'Most challenging mission ever' Eight inspectors who have been in Syria as part of an advance team that arrived on October 1 have now returned to the Netherlands, where the OPCW is based, said Uzumcu, the director general. He praised the ""fortitude and courage"" they had shown in ""fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization."" No further inspections are currently planned, given the progress made, the statement said. The next milestone for the mission will be November 15, it said, when the body's executive council must approve a detailed plan submitted by Syria for the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. There was no let-up Thursday in the violence that has raged for more than 2Â½ years in Syria. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported shelling in the Yarmouk and Tishreen areas of Damascus and intermittent clashes between the Free Syrian Army and government forces in the Damascus suburbs. Talks with al-Assad . Diplomatic moves toward ending the conflict -- in which more than 100,000 people have died, according to U.N. estimates -- continued this week. U.N. envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi talked with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus on Wednesday in their first meeting since December. Brahimi spoke to al-Assad about the framework for holding a planned conference involving all parties in the conflict in Geneva, Switzerland. Al-Assad told Brahimi that any political solution to the crisis in Syria hinges on outside countries cutting off support to the rebels, according to state-run media. ""Any success for any political solution must be linked to the end of any military support to military groups and to pressure the countries that are supporting these groups and are facilitating the entry of the terrorists and mercenaries into Syria by providing money and military support,"" al-Assad said during the meeting, according to Syrian state television. He added, ""This is an important step to prepare the framework to allow a national dialogue and put clear mechanisms to reach the desired objectives at the upcoming peace talks."" The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and is now a full-blown civil war. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Claudia Rebaza, Khushbu Shah, Barbara Starr, Jim Sciutto and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: Syrian minister has reportedly asked inspectors spare 12 factories .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of current and former Russian diplomats and their spouses were charged with participating in a nine-year fraud scheme that allegedly bilked the U.S. government of more than $1.5 million in Medicaid benefits, according to a federal complaint unsealed Thursday. The 49 defendants -- 25 current and former Russian diplomats and 24 of their spouses -- allegedly exploited their positions by filing fraudulent Medicaid expenses related to prenatal care and childbirth, the complaint said. The complaint said that of 63 births to Russian diplomats in New York City in the past nine years, the overwhelming majority were paid for by Medicaid benefits. ""A multitude of Russian diplomats and their spouses ran a scam on the health care system designed to help Americans in need,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference. The defendants allegedly obtained letters from officials at the Russian U.N. Mission as well as from the Russian Federation in New York and the Russian Federation in the USA to prove their false incomes, according to the complaint. ""Being a diplomat does not give you the right to commit health care fraud,"" George Venizelos, assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office, said at a news conference. ""Some Russian officials based in New York allowed their employees to defraud the American taxpayer and take advantage of a health care program not designed for them,"" he added. ""Each diplomat listed in the complaint submitted an employer verification form from the Russian government misstating their income in an effort to qualify for benefits."" While the defendants were claiming false incomes, they also spent thousands of dollars on luxury items and vacations, the complaint said. They chartered helicopters, rented limousines and purchased jewelry from Tiffany & Co., Bharara said. He added, ""The scam exploited the weakness in the Medicaid system and the charges exposed shameful and systemic corruption among the Russian diplomats in New York."" Authorities said 11 of the 49 defendants still reside in New York but have not been arrested because they have diplomatic immunity. Diplomats cannot be arrested unless immunity is waived from the dissenting country, Bharara said. The most high-profile figure in the case is Andrey Demin, the current counselor at the Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. The complaint said he allegedly received $22,200 in Medicaid benefits from 2006 to 2008. CNN's calls to Demin seeking comment were not returned. The Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations declined to comment. According to Bharara, employers are responsible for the diplomat's health care payments. The defendants have been charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud, conspiracy to steal government funds and making false statements relating to health care matters, according to the criminal complaint.

"(CNN) -- The Florida judge presiding over the George Zimmerman murder trial ruled Monday that Zimmerman's attorneys will be able to present evidence about how Trayvon Martin may have been high on marijuana the night he was shot to death. Martin's toxicology report indicates that THC, the active drug in marijuana, was in his blood at the time of his death on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch captain, is charged with second-degree murder for killing 17-year-old Martin in Sanford, Florida. He told police that night that the teenager looked suspicious and that there had been several break-ins in the neighborhood. The two got into a physical altercation, and Zimmerman said he was forced to draw his gun and kill Martin. Zimmerman's attorneys argued Monday that the report shows Martin's judgment may have been impaired the night of the shooting and that it may have affected his decision-making. Prosecutors fought hard against the admission of Martin's THC levels, accusing Zimmerman's attorneys of trying to get bad-character evidence in through the backdoor. Judge Debra Nelson told prosecutors they could cross-examine expert defense witness who testify about the effects of THC. Prosecutors can also call their own expert to contradict the defense's case during their rebuttal. Zimmerman's drug use has also come up in the case. Ben Crump, Martin's family's attorney, says Zimmerman should have been tested for drugs the night of the shooting. A fire and EMS report says Zimmerman was on the medications Librax and Temazepam at the time of the incident. WebMD says Librax is a combination of two drugs, one that reduces stomach cramping and another drug that reduces anxiety. Temazepam, according to WebMD, is a sleep medication that is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. It is not clear whether Zimmerman's drug use the night of the shooting will be admissible at trial.","Judge allows Zimmerman defense to introduce Trayvon Martin's toxicology report .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japan will lobby a dozen members of the International Whaling Commission at a meeting Monday to support its much-criticized Antarctic whaling program -- just three days before all members of the commission meet in London to discuss reaching an agreement on whale conservation rules. Japan's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year. Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the nation's fisheries agency will make their case to officials from Angola, Eritrea, Congo, Guinea, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Palau, Micronesia, Cambodia, Laos and Vanuatu, a government spokesperson said. Several of the countries are new to the 78-member whaling commission. Two months ago, Japan ""temporarily halted"" its plan for a humpback whale hunt in the seas near Antarctica as what it said was a gesture to enhance the dialogue at the International Whaling Commission, which remains torn over whaling. Japan, which says it is conducting the hunt as part of scientific research, believes the practice is environmentally and scientifically sound. The country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year -- the fisheries agency insists it wants ""sustainable whaling."" However, many in the international community -- particularly Australia -- believe that such hunts amount to needless slaughter. Critics believe that calling it research is just a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants. Greenpeace spokesman Junichi Sato told CNN that Monday's meeting is nothing more than Japan ""wining and dining its way to win votes.""","Japan will lobby IWC members to support its Antarctic whaling program .

"(CNN) -- Mexico has received the support of parliamentary leaders from 10 nations in opposition to Arizona's controversial new immigration law, the Mexican Senate president said Wednesday. Mexico and the other nations signed a declaration expressing their ""strong condemnation and profound rejection of the law,"" said Senate President Carlos Navarrete Ruiz. The Arizona law, which is scheduled to go into effect later this month, requires anyone being investigated by police for a possible crime to provide proof of legal residency. Opponents say the measure is discriminatory and invites racial profiling, but supporters say it's necessary to curb the flood of illegal immigrants in the border state. The U.S. Justice Department filed suit against the law, SB 1070, this month on the ground that Arizona is usurping federal authority to control the border and enforce immigration law. The federal suit has drawn opposition from some members of Congress. On Wednesday, 81 senators and representatives filed an amicus brief disputing the Justice Department contention that the law is unconstitutional. Mexico has been a vocal opponent of the law since the Arizona legislature passed it in April. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Navarrete said Mexico received support from Uruguay, Panama, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guatemala, Cuba, Turkey, Senegal, Micronesia and Ghana. Mexico also received backing from the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council, Navarrete said, according to the state-run Notimex news agency. The declarations of support came at the three-day Third World Conference of Parliamentary Presidents, which ended Wednesday in Geneva, Switzerland.","Arizona's SB 1070 requires proof of residency from anyone being investigated for a crime .

"(CNN) -- Fact: The most underrated cute animal on the face of the planet is the walrus. Sure, it's a 4,000-pound, breathing pile of assorted blubbery walrus parts, but so are most Americans. Thus, who are we to judge the walrus. Besides, IT HAS A MUSTACHE! And that has to count for something. Even if it means they're the unintentional hipsters of the animal kingdom. So, yes, they're super fat and toothy, and they probably like bands you've never heard of, but walruses are still cute. And if they happen to do fun party tricks like sit-ups or playing a saxophone or PBR keg stands, it's all over. Cuteness overload. Reward the walrus with fish. The same applies to Wilford Brimley: If he performs, feed the man. ""Thanks, Wilford. Have a mackerel."" But here's the thing Walruses aren't really ... walruses. Apparently, now, they are officially known as wordbanks. And here's why. About a week ago, 39-year-old Jim Ruderer of Hillsborough, New Jersey was just washing dishes in his home while his wife, Heather, rummaged through papers in their son's school folder. Heather walked over to Jim, didn't say anything, and just showed him one particular assignment from their son, Jonas. And it was hilarious. You see, Jonas, who is in kindergarten, had incorrectly identified a seal as a walrus from a word bank of several different arctic animals in a matching exercise. Which, mind you, is easy enough for anyone to do. Especially a five-year-old. But that's not the funny part. The seal labeling was just a small mistake. And, to his credit, Jonas did correctly identify the shark. And the polar bear. And the arctic hare. And the arctic fox. Just not the seal. Or the walrus. For that one, he chose ... wordbank. As in, the heading from the box where the various animal names were printed. ""Heather and I could not stop laughing,"" Ruderer explained to me. ""Jonas asked what was so funny, but flitted off to play with his brothers and sisters before we could work out what to say."" So, eventually, being a modern parent, Jim did what was absolutely necessary -- he posted Jonas' school assignment on the website Reddit. This was on Wednesday evening, right before Jim started making dinner. Ruderer says that, amazingly, by the time they began eating, an image of his son's schoolwork was already the most popular post on the main page. ""I've never topped Reddit before,"" he says. ""So, it was kind of exciting to see it well-received."" And then Reddit did what Reddit does. It went mildly insane. By the time Ruderer and his wife started putting their five children to bed, pictures of walruses labeled as ""wordbanks"" started showing up everywhere, including several Beatles-themed images. I am the wordbank. Goo goo ga joob. Quite simply, Ruderer had created an Internet ... thing. The next day, the walrus/wordbank situation got even stranger as more images and mentions started showing up on Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram and Google+. It was a modern phenomenon, and walruses had officially become wordbanks. Of course, Ruderer says, Jonas doesn't totally understand what's going on, but nevertheless likes the idea of being in the news and knowing that people found humor in his schoolwork. And he's sticking with it. Ruderer explained, ""He just started saying 'wordbank' a lot. Which is pretty much what Reddit did, too."" And it couldn't have happened to a finer animal, for the walrus deserves a moment in the spotlight. Especially before they all die. Despite their blubbery adorableness, they are a stark reminder that being overweight is no laughing matter. It can lead to heart disease and diabetes. So, you check your blood sugar, and you check it often. ""Thanks, Wilford. Have a mackerel.""

"(CNN) -- Here's yet another time when I'm oh-so-thankful my kids are too young to a) be Justin Bieber fans and b) know anything about his arrest and Lamborghini joy ride allegedly under the influence of marijuana, alcohol and prescription drugs. Sadly, parents of tweens and teens, especially those who continue to adore the 19-year-old superstar (despite his ongoing public travails), are not quite so lucky. But instead of fretting over what to say, many parents believe his arrest is a chance to continue the conversation about drinking, drug use and doing either while behind the wheel. ""I have used these sorts of 'public displays of difficulty,' as I like to call them, to sometimes segue into a conversation about what they would do if they had a friend who was in the same situation,"" said Devra Gordon Renner, a mom of two in Northern Virginia and co-author of the book ""Mommy Guilt."" ""However, I don't use these as teachable moments all of the time,"" Gordon Renner, a clinical social worker, said in response to a request for comment on Facebook. ""Teens only listen for so long and too many 'examples' feels like proselytizing to them."" Parents should try to do more listening than talking, and ask kids what they think about Bieber's troubles, said Rachel Vail, a New York City mom of two and author of numerous books for kids and teens including her latest ""Kiss Me Again."" ""Scaffold their growing ability to think through complex issues like celebrity, entitlement, fame, substance abuse -- and really listen to their thoughts,"" said Vail, also on Facebook. ""So often we think we have to have the correct answers and serve them up like so many inoculations to our kids. Being present and asking questions is sometimes the wiser, more respectful, and ultimately more empowering route."" Asking kids what really defines ""greatness"" could be enormously beneficial to them, said Tish Howard, a mother, grandmother and former elementary school principal. ""In conversations with my young students, I tried to steer the dialogue with them to a point where they were telling me the qualities they thought made someone worthy of being idolized,"" said Howard, who continues to work with schools through her education consulting firm. ""Kids can come to an accepted belief that it's not the talent that makes you great. It is what you do with it and your contribution to the whole that defines you,"" said Howard. ""It is okay for kids to love (Bieber's) voice but differentiate that from him being a model of behavior."" Parents can sometimes ""go overboard"" when it comes to worrying about who their teens idolize, said Gordon Renner, the clinical social worker. ""Who amongst us did not swoon for someone when we were teens? But in reality did any of us copy their lives and confuse it with reality?"" she added. PHOTOS: Justin Bieber's inner circle . Jenny Dean Schmidt, a mom of two and radio host of The Channelmom Show in Denver, says her 11-year-old would say she chose not to be a Bieber fan ""on purpose."" ""We make a point of steering our kids away from 'idol worship,' reminding them that they are just as valuable as any celebrity,"" Dean Schmidt said. ""The fact that Mr. (Is he old enough for Mr.?) Bieber was arrested helps us drive home that point. Celebrities are just as fallible as anyone else, and there's no need to worship them."" Evan Katz, a behavioral therapist and author of the book ""Inside the Mind of an Angry Man,"" believes Bieber is suffering from what therapists call ""imposter syndrome."" ""It's basically someone who really lives in fear of being revealed for who he or she believes they really are,"" said Katz, who said he suffered from this himself and shared his own experiences in his book. ""I guarantee when they go home and look in the mirror after a huge concert and a huge night that they don't see the person that everyone else is seeing,"" Katz said of Bieber and other celebrities who might struggle with insecurities. ""In fact, they are scared to death that people are going to see the person that they are seeing so ... the person will continue to implode and fall apart."" Katz's advice to parents is to encourage kids to learn from the pop star instead of criticizing him. ""The lesson is happiness is an inside job and that true validation has to come from looking in the mirror and liking who you see regardless of ... chaos going on around you,"" Katz said. Justin Bieber ""got lost somehow and had to give up himself and he was so overwhelmed with validation from outside himself that he was lost and you don't want that to happen to you,"" said Katz, describing a conversation parents could have with their kids. As for Bieber's teenage fans, Dean Schmidt, the Denver radio personality, believes they shouldn't stop liking him. ""And I'll go one step further and say they shouldn't judge him,"" she said. ""Every person needs love, so I'm not going to tell a child to stop loving a person (celebrity or not) just because they've made some bad decisions.""' ""It is important to remind our kids that our mistakes do not define us,"" said Melissa Atkins Wardy, author of the new book ""Redefining Girly: How Parents Can Fight the Stereotyping and Sexualizing of Girlhood, from Birth to Tween."" ""Justin's mistakes are a big deal, but they are not life altering,"" Atkins Wardy said. ""Thankfully, no one was killed while Justin was driving drunk and drag racing. Luckily, no one overdosed that night."" That said, his troubles are also a cautionary tale of what fame can bring, she added. ""An important thing to point out to our kids is just how many of these young stars have crashed and burned out like this. Maybe,"" she said, ""being famous isn't all it is cracked up to be.""

"(CNN) -- ""What # are you at?"" The brief e-mail arrived late on the morning of January 24. I keep looking at it. It was from Jeff Zaslow. We first became friends more than 25 years ago. We got together as often as we could when we found ourselves in the same town, usually for long, laughter-filled dinners; Jeff, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, in recent years became the author of multiple big bestselling books, most of them on inspirational themes. ""What # are you at?"" He was going to be making appearances for his latest book, ""The Magic Room,"" and he had looked at his schedule and saw that he had a few days between speeches in the South. He knew that I'd been holed up in a hotel on the west coast of Florida, trying to get some writing done. He was going to take those two days between speeches to join me and just hang out. So we talked on the phone, and arranged the days. Today -- Sunday, March 4 -- is the day he was to arrive. On February 10, on his way back to his home in suburban Detroit from a book signing in Petoskey, Michigan, the night before, Jeff was killed instantly when, according to police, his car skidded on a snowy road and was hit head-on by an oncoming semitrailer truck. He was 53. Jeff's wife, Sherry, his three daughters, Jordan, Alex and Eden, and his parents, Harry and Naomi, have suffered an unfathomable loss. The obituaries and tributes written by his friends and colleagues have all centered on Jeff's never-ending thoughtfulness and compassion. The tributes have been entirely accurate; the constancy of Jeff's kindness was one of life's rarities. Today, when Jeff should have been arriving for our time together, I'd like to pass on a lesson from him that I believe can be used to great effect by anyone, regardless of his or her line of work. It has to do with the book that first made him a bestselling author, ""The Last Lecture,"" written with Professor Randy Pausch of Carnegie Mellon University. The book was a publishing phenomenon: 5 million copies sold in the English language alone, translations into 48 languages around the world. Some people thought that Jeff got lucky with that book. But luck had nothing to do with it. In early September 2007, Jeff was working on a Wall Street Journal column about a trend he was hearing about at U.S. universities. Professors were thinking what they might say if they had to deliver one last lecture, and were in fact giving those lectures, summing up what had been meaningful in their lives. As he was reporting the piece, Jeff learned that a professor at Carnegie Mellon -- Pausch -- was going to give what might literally be his last lecture. Pausch was dying from pancreatic cancer. It was going to be inconvenient for Jeff to go from Detroit to Pittsburgh for the speech; there was a problem with the price of the flight, and the schedule, and he also had obligations to attend to in Michigan that day. It would have been much easier just to call the professor and get a quote, or have the university send him an audio or video recording of the lecture. Remember: Jeff didn't even know, at that point, whether Pausch's lecture would warrant a whole column. But he got up that morning in Detroit and -- Jeff being Jeff -- decided that he really ought to see for himself. He was an established and respected Wall Street Journal staff member; no one at the paper would have faulted him for doing a quick interview with Pausch on the phone. Jeff got in his car and drove more than 300 miles from Detroit to Pittsburgh to sit in the audience and listen to the speech. A five-hour drive there, and then a five-hour, 300-mile drive back. It paid off spectacularly, of course. The column -- moving, tender, insightful -- was a sensation, and the book that he ended up writing with Pausch gave Jeff a new career in the top echelon of American authors, and provided financial security for his family. But -- and this is what is important -- it was nothing he didn't do all the time. In his work, he always went the extra step -- the extra hundred steps. He never took the easy way. I remember, seven or eight years ago, well before ""The Last Lecture,"" Jeff had come to Chicago to interview an old-time vaudeville performer. To the best of my recollection, the newspaper story was going to have something to do with audiences, or audience reactions. The old performer was going to be one sliver of a longer piece. An easy phone-call interview. But Jeff didn't do things that way. He flew to Chicago and, suitcase in hand (he hadn't checked into his hotel yet), met me at the restaurant where we had arranged to have dinner. At one point we talked about why, at this stage in his career, he still pushed himself so hard. He said he just wanted to look into the man's eyes when he interviewed him the next day. He felt the story would be a little better that way. At the end of the meal we went to the coat-check window; they had taken Jeff's suitcase down a long flight of stairs to store it on a basement level. Jeff didn't want the young woman to have to carry it up the stairs, so he went down to get it. I stood there and watched as he came up the steep flight of stairs, visibly weary, huffing, sweating, lugging the heavy bag; we looked at each other and both of us burst out laughing. ""Look at you,"" I said. ""You look like 'Death of a [cuss-word-adjective] Salesman.'"" ""I know,"" he said. ""Why do I do this?"" We both knew the answer. He did it because it was the right way to do a job. And it doesn't matter what a person does for a living. It can be the lawyer who stays late to look up a few more citations of case law, to give his client the best possible chance. It can be the teacher who goes over the lesson plan one more time, adding something vital to it at midnight, even though the students or the school administrators will never be aware of the effort she has put in. It can be the factory worker who takes it upon himself to check the specifications a third and fourth time, wanting to be absolutely certain that the product will be as close to perfect as humanly possible. Does it always pay off, as Jeff's 10 hours on the road paid off with ""The Last Lecture""? Of course not. It hardly ever pays off that big. Most times, your boss, your colleagues, your own family will never know that you put in the extra effort when you didn't have to. But you'll know. That's what counts. And when the day finally comes when you have your big success, when you get your big break, it won't be because you made the extra effort once. It will be because you made the extra effort every time. Jeff did. And that's the lesson I'd like to pass on for him. Especially today. The silence at the dinner hour tonight is going to be awfully loud.

"(CNN) -- It was just after 5 a.m. on a cold November morning in 2011 when Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., a 68-year-old former Marine with a severe heart condition, accidentally set off a medical alert pendant. An ambulance was dispatched to Chamberlain's White Plains, New York, apartment, though police who respond to such calls as a matter of routine arrived ahead of the emergency medical workers. Within the hour, Chamberlain, who is black, lay dying -- from two rounds fired into his upper body by a white police officer. What led to the shooting of Chamberlain is the subject of a grand jury hearing underway this month, and a matter of heated debate between the White Plains Police Department and Chamberlain's family and friends. Police say Chamberlain came at them with a butcher knife when they broke down the door after he refused to open it; the family claims the elderly Chamberlain was unarmed, and that he told police through the closed door that he did not need any assistance. In wake of the case of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed, black 17-year-old who was shot and killed in Sanford, Florida, by a neighborhood watch volunteer, the Chamberlain case has gained national interest -- and national media attention. More than 206,000 people have signed an online petition demanding ""Justice for Kenneth Chamberlain Sr.,"" with many signatories drawing similarities between the case and that of Martin. The petition, started by Chamberlain's son, Kenneth Jr., calls for Westchester District Attorney Janet DiFiore to charge the officers involved in the shooting with murder and civil rights violations. ""I am sorry for your loss. An outrage of the magnitude of Trayvon Martin,"" Karen Goodwin of Dover, New Hampshire, wrote on the petition. Much of the controversy surrounds audio and video recordings made in the minutes before the November 19 shooting. The medical alert device recorded much of the conversation between police and Chamberlain, according to Kenneth Chamberlain Jr., who said authorities played the audio and video for the family in the aftermath of the shooting. ""You hear one of the officers use expletive and said that he didn't give an F. Used the N-word,"" he said. Law enforcement sources confirmed to CNN's Soledad O'Brien that racial slurs are clearly heard on the audio tape. Chamberlain's niece, Tonya Greenhill, who lived next door, said she heard police banging on her uncle's door that morning. Greenhill, who has been called to testify before the grand jury, said she told police that her uncle accidentally set off his medical alert device and that they should allow his family to talk to him, to calm him down. ""I continued to hear my uncle begging and pleading to please leave him alone,"" Greenhill told O'Brien. ""I just keep hearing my uncle respond 'Please leave me alone, go away. I didn't call you. I don't need your help.'"" According to a police report, the officers contend Chamberlain put a hatchet through a gap in the front door as officers were trying to pry it open. A video tape recorded by a surveillance camera in the hallway outside the apartment, and another recorded by a camera mounted on a Taser -- both shown to the family by the district attorney -- show that he is unarmed, Chamberlain's son said. Neither video show the shooting. The video from the Taser cut out after it was used. Police contend they attempted to subdue Chamberlain first with non-lethal force. ""The officers first used an electronic Taser, which was discharged, hit the victim, and had no effect. While the officers were retreating, the officers then used a bean bag shotgun,"" said David Chong, a White Plains police spokesman. When that failed to stop Chamberlain, an officer opened fire. The officer has been identified as Anthony Carelli. Chong said his office is cooperating with a grand jury investigation, but would not say whether Carelli continues to be on patrol. Carelli's lawyers say he is a decorated officer who followed procedures. ""We trust that the grand jury will rightfully determine that Officer Carelli's actions, while perhaps not understandable or acceptable to the family members, attorneys and other emissaries of the Chamberlain family, were justified under our laws,"" Carelli's attorney Andrew C. Quinn told CNN in a written statement. An autopsy report, obtained by CNN, shows the gunshots hit Chamberlain in the side of the arm, indicating he either was not facing the officers or had turned away. Westchester County is an affluent suburb north of New York City, though Chamberlain lived in a one-bedroom apartment in a public housing project in White Plains -- a commercial hub of roughly 60,000. ""I think that what happened that night is that Mr. Chamberlain happened to live in public housing and we had police officers who gave him a command to open the door and when he didn't acknowledge their command, really became very agitated and angry because he was defying what they asked him to do,"" Chamberlain attorney Randy McLaughlin said on ""AC360."" ""They forgot that they were there to deal with a medical emergency. You have here a 68-year-old man who has served this country in Vietnam for six years, and a 20-year retired member of the Department of Corrections for Westchester County who died, but didn't have to die."" The Chamberlains have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the police department. The shooting death also prompted Westchester County residents to start a ""Network for Police Accountability,"" which calls on the police department to publicize how and when its officers may use deadly force. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","The case is drawing parallels to the shooting of Trayvon Martin .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Security threats from mobile malware are on the rise and nearly 95% of targets operate on the Android operating system, according to a new report from NQ Mobile. The mobile security firm, with headquarters in both the U.S. and China, estimates that nearly 33 million Android devices were targeted by malware in 2012 -- a jump of more than 200% from the year prior. ""Android is one of the most powerful operating systems in the world. It allows developers to develop some of the most innovative applications out there,"" said Omar Khan, Co-CEO of NQ Mobile, to CNN's Nina dos Santos. ""But because it's so open it also gives the opportunity for bad actors in the system to take advantage of that openness to develop malicious applications as well."" According to the NQ report, one type of malware is delivered through app repackaging in which a user downloads a mobile application that looks legitimate but is actually a harmful program. Malware can also be downloaded through fake websites when a user clicks on a URL that appears authentic but is not. Mobile users can also be duped through so-called ""smishing"" -- a combination of the words SMS and phishing -- where a user receives a text message asking for personal information like a credit card number, e-mail address or social security number. And while personal information is one casualty from malicious software, personal harm could occur with new programs being developed. Earlier this month, a German hacker -- and licensed commercial pilot -- raised eyebrows with claims he developed an app that could remotely hijack an airplane using an Android phone. With the increase in mobile malware, consumers need to be smarter in how they protect themselves and where they click. Nearly 25% of malware on mobile devices comes from pornography websites, according to a recent study from Blue Coat, a Web security and optimization company. Also, more than three of every 10 smartphone users have no password on their device according to a global survey by Web security firm McAfee. NQ's Khan puts the number even higher -- at one out of every two. ""The simplest thing we can do is put passwords on our phones. Installing security and encryption solutions (are another) way to do it. Also educating our consumers and our enterprise users not to connect and leave open wi-fi connections or Bluetooth connections -- only to connect to trusted sources. A lot of times we'll connect to anything."" The NQ report also revealed that China, India and Russia were the top three countries with infected mobile devices. ""In the emerging markets it's our only lifeline to the internet so hackers are finding that information more and more valuable which is why they're going after these devices,"" said Khan.","Security threats by malicious software targeting mobile devices on rise, says NQ Mobile .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Our educational system is essentially a Soviet-style government-run monopoly that could only be loved by the likes of Lenin and Stalin. HLN Money Expert Clark Howard says the American education system isn't giving taxpayers their money's worth. Now, I know that's a strong opening statement, but consider this: The government decides where your kids go to school; what curriculum they'll study; and even develops long-term educational plans just like the Communists devised five-year plans. This kind of ""one-size-fits-all"" approach really punishes kids. And zero tolerance policies are a symptom of the stranglehold our government has on schools. For example, the Supreme Court recently heard a case about a 13-year-old Arizona student suspected of possessing Advil back in 2003. For that crime, she was strip-searched to see if she had hidden ibuprofen pills on her body. The Arizona school system maintained it had the right to do what it did. What's more, it remained defiant through the years, constantly appealing unfavorable lower court decisions when challenged. Arizona ultimately took the case all the way up to the highest court in the land. In late June, the Supremes ruled 8-1 that the school system's actions were unconstitutional.  See Clark discuss why he thinks governments shouldn't own banks » . In another instance of an insane zero tolerance policy, The Washington Post reports that a Virginia teen was suspended for two weeks last year after taking a prescription birth-control pill during lunch. This was not a religious or moral issue; the school was instead arguing that it was illegal for students to have prescription pills on the premises. That student even faced expulsion! This is what we've done by not offering school choice in our nation. I have long been a fan of vouchers, charter schools and home schooling to bust up the government monopoly on the education of our children. Do you think this whole issue doesn't affect you because you don't have kids? Think again. Huge amounts of your taxes are still spent to support schools that are failures. If this country is going to invest so much into government-run education, we should be taking a cue from a nation like Finland. Simply put, the Finns have the best public education system in the world. Their 15 year-old students are consistently excelling in standardized testing versus any other nation, according to the results of the most recent PISA exams (Program for International Student Assessment) -- a test of academic proficiency administered every three years in many countries. Finnish students ranked No. 1 in science scores, and No. 2 in both math and reading. And the United States? We come in at No. 29 in science, No. 35 in math, and a recent U.S. reading score which wouldn't even track in the top 10 countries in the world. In Finland, children begin studying algebra, geometry and statistics in the first grade.  By 15, they speak three languages, which, of course, is not uncommon throughout Europe. According to The Dallas Morning News, a team of Texas educators recently traveled to Helsinki to learn from the Finns. What they found was that teachers had 100 percent freedom to educate as they saw fit. They treated their classroom like an entrepreneur would treat his or her business. Contrast that to how we do things in America with our five-year plans and giant bureaucracies determining what gets taught. Our brand of institutionalized ""education lite"" -- with far too few hours spent in the classroom and an antiquated summer vacation schedule from America's agrarian days -- just isn't cutting it.","HLN Money Expert Clark Howard: U.S. education system isn't adding up .

"(CNN) -- A woman died Friday while riding the Texas Giant roller coaster at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, according to a statement released by the theme park. The park did not release any details about how the woman died on the Texas Giant, touted as the tallest steel-hybrid roller coaster in the world. ""Since the safety of our guests and employees in our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation,"" the statement said. The Arlington Police Department did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The Texas Giant was originally designed in 1990 as an all wooden roller coaster. It was redesigned with a steel track and reopened in April 2011 to mark the theme park's 50th anniversary. At its highest point, the roller coaster is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet, according to the theme park. Thousands of kids hurt yearly on amusement rides . Elsewhere, seven people suffered minor injuries in a boat-ride mishap at the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, park officials said. The incident occurred Friday evening when a boat rolled backwards down a lift hill on the Shoot the Rapids ride, park spokesman Bryan Edwards said in an e-mailed statement. The seven people in the boat were evaluated and treated by Cedar Point emergency medical staff, Edwards said. One of the seven was taken to an area hospital for additional evaluation and was subsequently released, he said. ""Shoot the Rapids will remain closed until park officials and inspectors from the state of Ohio complete their review,"" Edwards said.","Ride mishap at Ohio's Cedar Point injures 7, officials say .

"(CNN) -- A United States Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon completes a triple roll in the sky above the largest aerospace and defense show in Asia. It's followed with an aerial demonstration by the U.S. MV-22B Osprey -- the world's first production tilt-rotor aircraft. It can take off and land like a helicopter, but flies with the range, airspeed and payload of a fixed-wing airplane. Inside the vast exhibition hall, trade visitors to the biennial Singapore Airshow eye some of the latest global offerings in military technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles, anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft, fire control radars and infrared counter-measures. Keen to demonstrate its supremacy in defense and aerospace technology, the United States has more on display than any other country. ""A lot of the bells and whistles, new avionics, and the 21st century equipment -- it all started as industry and showcasing their work,"" says Col. Marc Caudill, mission commander for the U.S. military forces supporting the airshow. China's approach . In the same exhibition hall, there's a different approach from China. Little is known about the extent of China's military capabilities, and so when the country takes part in an airshow, as in Singapore, it attracts attention. Compared with more than 160 U.S. military and commercial companies represented in Singapore this week, China has 20 exhibitors. Defense experts say any discussion of China's military capabilities needs to be centered around what's not on display, rather than what is. The U.S. defense budget is the highest in the world, with IHS Jane's Defence estimating last year's spending at $582.4 billion. But China's fast-growing economy has also allowed hefty increases in military spending. Its defense budget of $139.2 billion for 2013 is the world's second largest, according to IHS Defence, which provides defense and security analysis. Couple that with regional disputes escalating in Asia, including China's controversial declaration of an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea -- and its increased assertiveness in the South China Sea -- and the country is increasingly seen as a major force. Generals, ministers, bureaucrats . At the Singapore event, manufacturers rub shoulders with high-ranking generals, government ministers and defense bureaucrats from around the world, all eyeing potential deals. ""No one wants this to be seen as an arms bazaar, but on the other hand, it's a good opportunity to position your wares and explain where you fit into the broader strategic context,"" says Richard Aboulafia, analyst of the Teal Group, which researches the aerospace and defense industry. The state-owned China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC) has one of the show's largest stands out of the Chinese exhibitors. CATIC's core business is aviation defense -- models on display here include the L-15 advanced jet trainer, the FC-1/JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, an attack helicopter, and an unmanned combat aerial vehicle, the Wing Loong. Competing with the Russians . China is working hard to sell its aircraft overseas, says Wendell Minnick, Asia bureau chief for Defense News. ""They really want to sell the L-15 -- that's a big deal,"" Minnick says. ""They're looking at markets like Africa and South America -- more affordable platforms that compete with the Russians."" But Minnick says China's models on display pale in comparison with those of the U.S. ""These are very simple platforms, including single engine fighters. They wouldn't last long against the Americans but they're not worried about that. You know if they want to go up against the Americans they'll use their air-to-air or surface- to-air missiles and knock out one of our fighter jets."" Acrobatic displays . Missing from the CATIC stand is a model of the fourth-generation, Chinese-made J-10 fighter, the multi-role combat aircraft which, some weeks ago, was expected to take part in the airshow's aerobatic displays, but later inexplicably pulled out. At the airshow, the U.S. is displaying a mock-up of its fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, but the development of its Chinese equivalents, the J-20 and J-31 stealth fighters, is shrouded in secrecy. ""I think it's less about hardware and more about just posturing,"" says Richard Aboulafia, analyst of the Teal Group, which researches the aerospace and defense industry. ""The U.S. is extremely transparent, and the West tends to regard military capability as something you slowly develop and then you deploy. And if it comes to it, you use it. Vision of warfare . ""China's deployment of prototypes speaks to a vision of warfare that's completely different from the West."" Richard Bitzinger, senior fellow from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and global expert on the Chinese military, agrees. ""I think China has been able to think creatively about how they use what they do have. That's why we're worried about things like their cyber war capabilities or new types of weapons systems like an anti-ship ballistic missile,"" Bitzinger says. ""It doesn't have to be particularly cutting edge, high-tech, 22nd century stuff, but the fact that [the Chinese] have it, and how they use it, are things that change the rules of the road."" When it comes to China, quantity has a quality all of its own, Bitzinger says. Military power is about how your equipment stacks up against your likely competitor, he adds.","Biennial Singapore Airshow shows off latest in military technology .

"(CNN) -- Ireland gave Brian O'Driscoll a dramatic farewell to international rugby by clinching the Six Nations title with a tense 22-20 victory over France in Paris on Saturday. The 35-year-old center was named man of the match in his record-extending 141st appearance at the highest level, as Ireland won the European tournament for the first time since 2009. A French victory would have given the title to England, who thrashed Italy 52-11 in Rome earlier Saturday to end Les Bleus' own hopes. France, beaten World Cup finalist in 2011, could have denied the Irish after scoring a controversial 63rd-minute try to Dimitri Szarzewski -- but Jean Marc Doussain missed a routine penalty kick soon after. The video official missed a knock-on by Szarzewski when the hooker touched down, but the home fans were left frustrated when a late match-winning score in the corner was ruled out following several TV replays for a forward pass by Pascal Pape. ""It feels great to be a two-time Six Nations winner,"" O'Driscoll said after his team held off the furious French onslaught. ""So many seconds along the years and so many disappointments -- it's great to finish my career on a high. When I do hang this jersey up on the hook inside it will be with fond memories. ""It was last-leg stuff and I know now why I'm packing it in because 80 minutes is a long bloody time at international level, particularly with guys like Mathieu Bastereaud running at you -- it's no fun."" It was Ireland's first win in Paris since 2000, which was also by a two-point margin. Fly-half Johnny Sexton was one of the heroes on this occasion, scoring two of Ireland's three tries, but he was stretchered off with 10 minutes to go after being knocked out in a tackle. The victory margin gave Ireland the title by 10 points on differential from England, who won the two teams' encounter 13-10 at Twickenham last month. ""Credit to Ireland -- they are deserved winners and it's a fitting finale and sendoff for Brian O'Driscoll, a legend of the game whom everyone in this squad respects massively,"" said England head coach Stuart Lancaster. ""We always knew this was going to be one of the tightest Six Nations and go down to the wire.""

"(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher has been one of Pirelli's biggest critics this season, but Formula One's tire supplier has backed the seven-time world champion to end his long wait for a victory at Sunday's European Grand Prix. The 43-year-old, who has not finished on the podium since coming out of retirement in 2010, told CNN that dealing with the rapidly degrading rubber this year was like ""driving on raw eggs."" He has been outshone by Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, but Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery believes the German can perform well in Valencia, where he has failed to make the top-10 in two previous attempts. Schumacher did, however, top the qualifying times at another street circuit last month in Monaco, but started the race sixth due to a penalty and ended up retiring early -- as he did last time out in Canada. ""I think you have to look at someone like, maybe Michael, getting the pole position,"" Hembery told F1's official website. ""He probably would have won Monaco if he hadn't been penalized, so why not here? Michael for Valencia, that's where the money should go."" Sauber chief: ""F1 better than ever"" Schumacher, who won 91 grands prix between 1992 and 2006, was penalized in Monte Carlo due to a collision with Bruno Senna at the Spanish Grand Prix. The former Ferrari driver has endured a miserable start to the 2012 season, collecting just two world championship points and retiring from five of the first seven races. Rosberg, meanwhile, is fifth on 67 points and clinched the first race win of his career in China. But Schumacher, who has won the European Grand Prix a record six times at its former homes in Jerez and Nurburgring, is confident Mercedes can overcome the reliability issues which have dogged him. ""Our motto in the last few days has been to roll our sleeves up and focus on the job in hand,"" he said. ""Everybody in the team has taken that approach to heart, so we can travel to Valencia in an optimistic mood."" Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn, who worked with Schumacher at Ferrari, conceded he has not provided him with an adequate car. ""The performance of our car and our tire management were generally good in Canada, however our competitiveness was compromised by reliability problems and mistakes,"" said Brawn. ""This is a disappointment that is deeply felt by everyone in our team, and we have been working hard to ensure we understand the reasons and deal with them. ""Achieving zero-defect reliability is our highest priority. The opportunities available if we can give both drivers a reliable car and a clean weekend are clear.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A company dispatcher who was seated in the cockpit jump seat as Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 landed at the wrong Missouri airport has been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation, the company told CNN on Tuesday. Investigators will want to know whether the dispatcher distracted the pilot as the Boeing 737 and its 124 passengers approached the airport, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. The pilots of Sunday's flight, which departed from Chicago's Midway airport, remain on paid leave. The dispatcher will give investigators another source of information and open up another line of questions surrounding the landing at M. Graham Clark Downtown Airport near the resort community of Branson, Missouri. An industry official said the Federal Aviation Administration, which is conducting its own investigation, has reviewed the actions of air traffic controllers at Branson Airport and ""indicate that there appears to be no controller issue."" The Southwest dispatcher was authorized by the company to fly in the jump seat -- which is a fold-down seat in the cockpit. Related: How could this happen? Under an FAA regulation known as the ""sterile cockpit"" rule, pilots must restrict all conversations to flying-related matters when planes are taking off and landing. The rule is intended to keep distractions from interfering with the flight. The FAA, along with the National Transportation Safety Board and Southwest remained largely silent Tuesday about the investigation. However, the pilots have been given routine drug and alcohol tests. Results of the tests have not come back, said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. The NTSB plans to interview the pilots and the dispatcher in the coming days, Holloway said. Also, the NTSB is reviewing the airplane's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder. Preliminary information is expected to be released when it becomes available. Investigation officials acknowledged that the 737 had returned to service, suggesting that the investigation was focused on human factors and not mechanical malfunctions. An NTSB spokesman said officials planned to interview the pilots, but it was unknown if interviews had been scheduled. The official familiar with the incident said it was certain that the pilots would be asked if the third person in the cockpit had somehow distracted them. A review of cockpit voice recordings may also answer that question. Southwest said the flight's captain had worked for the airline for 14 years and the first officer had been with the company for 12. FAA air traffic controllers and company employees are sometimes permitted to ride in cockpit jump seats so they can learn about life ""on the other side of the frequency,"" as it's sometimes called. At one point, after a government investigation disclosed widespread abuse of the privilege by air traffic controllers, the FAA halted the program. But it was resurrected a few years ago under tighter controls. No one was hurt in Sunday's landing on the airport's relatively short runway. But it was memorable. One passenger said it was ""one of the hardest landings I ever experienced."" The plane stopped about 500 feet from the end of a runway, said Chris Berndt, the Western Taney County Fire District fire chief and emergency management director. If the plane had overshot the end of the runway it could have tumbled down an embankment and onto U.S. Highway 65. Southwest said Monday it has reached out directly to apologize to each passenger, refund their tickets and provide future travel credit.","NEW: 3rd person in cockpit of a Southwest 737 that landed at wrong airport placed on leave .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian teenage girl has been found guilty of distributing child pornography in connection with ""sexting"" pictures of her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend, the youth crown prosecutor for Victoria said Friday. The British Columbia case of the then 16-year-old, who is not identified because she is a minor, is believed to be one of the first cases in Canada where a teenager has been convicted of child pornography charges related to ""sexting."" The teenager, who also was convicted of uttering threats, is out on bail while awaiting sentencing, Crown Prosecutor Chandra Fisher said. She declined to speculate on what sentence the teen might face. Calling the case ""precedent-setting,"" Fisher said the case should serve as a warning to teens about what they text and post online. The case began in November 2012 when the teen learned that her 17-year-old boyfriend was still in contact with his former girlfriend. ""The accused was not at all happy that he was still in touch with his ex,"" Fisher told CNN. The teenager initially threatened the ex-girlfriend on Facebook, the prosecutor said. She then texted five explicit pictures of the ex-girlfriend that she found on her boyfriend's phone to a group of people, Fisher said. The teen's attorney, Christopher Mackie, said the charges were inappropriate. ""Our sights have always been set on the constitutional question. ...She never denied that she did this,"" he told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Small in size, the saints' relics provide a precious spiritual connection for parishioners at Ste. Genevieve Catholic Church. Still, the church's pastor and police in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, a river town settled by French colonists in the mid-18th century, are mystified as to why someone would steal nine of them. They hold little monetary value and would be difficult to sell without their paperwork. ""We are kind of at a loss,"" police Sgt. Steven Poole told CNN Saturday. The theft occurred sometime between Christmas Eve and January 4, when the dollar-coin-sized containers holding the nine relics were found empty. Those containers are displayed in larger vessels, called reliquaries, that sit on two side altars. For many worshipers, saints help them get closer to Jesus Christ, according to the Rev. Dennis Schmidt. Schmidt said the thief or thieves may have thought the relics, along with any small amount of gold or other metal with them, might make the job worthwhile. Schmidt said he doubts anyone took the items, which can include portions of a saint's body or pieces of garment, for religious reasons. ""If they had taken one ... I can see that, but to take nine of them, it doesn't seem practical,"" he said. ""This will probably be something that will turn up somewhere once they realize there's no real street value,"" Police Chief Eric Bennett told CNN St. Louis affiliate KSDK. The church has about two dozen relics, one of which belonged to Ste. Genevieve and was placed around the neck of her statue inside the church, said Schmidt. The relic of the patron saint of Paris is now in a secure location. The relics have been part of the Ste. Genevieve parish since the 1930s and 1940s, when the pastor at that time brought them back from several trips he made to Rome and elsewhere in Europe. ""Some people are really upset ... (asking) why somebody would do this,"" Schmidt said of the theft. Searches of area pawnshops have yielded none of the relics, Poole said. ""We are hoping we can get help from the community, by word of mouth or at the church or (someone who) saw something."" Because of its history and decor, the church is popular with tourists visiting the largely Catholic town, an hour south of St. Louis. The parish was founded by Jesuits who came from Quebec. Community leaders tout Historic Ste. Genevieve's heritage, charm and historic homes, some of which were built with distinctive vertical log construction. German immigrants who followed the French founders built rock and brick homes popular with visitors. The town of about 4,400 is on the west bank of the Mississippi River. Schmidt said the church, which serves about 1,100 families, will build a database to get a better handle on records and paperwork surrounding the relics. Leaders also are considering ways to secure the relics by placing them under glass attached to walls. For now, he and others are praying for the return of the historic and spiritual items. While Ste. Genevieve Catholic Church has insurance, the theft of the relics is no ordinary matter. ""How do we put value on it?"" Schmidt asked.","Nine relics were taken from the Catholic church .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former FBI and CIA Director William Webster will lead an outside investigation of the FBI's ""policies, practices and actions"" before the November massacre at Fort Hood, the bureau announced Tuesday. Webster, a former federal judge, conducted a previous review of the FBI following the exposure of double agent Robert Hanssen in 2001. He has been asked to look into ""whether there are improvements to our current practices or other authorities that could make us all safer in the future,"" current FBI Director Robert Mueller said in a statement Tuesday. ""We must be sure that the systems we have in place give investigators the tools they need to carry out their responsibilities,"" Mueller said. ""At the same time, we must ensure constitutional protections and the confidence of the American public we serve."" The FBI has said that Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens at the Fort Hood Army post, came to its attention as part of an unrelated terrorism probe in December 2008. Agents found Hasan and the subject of that investigation -- identified as a radical cleric from Yemen who had once preached at a Virginia mosque Hasan attended -- had been in communication, but their exchanges ""raised no red flags"" that would have turned agents' scrutiny on Hasan, senior investigative officials said in November. Webster, 85, led the FBI from 1978 until 1987, when then-President Ronald Reagan named him CIA director. Webster took over the spy agency in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra scandal and led it until 1991. The FBI already has conducted a preliminary review of the Fort Hood matter. Meanwhile, the Pentagon is conducting its own investigation into whether any signs that could have warned of the rampage were missed. Webster's investigation will be coordinated with the Defense Department to avoid interference with the Army-led inquiry, and he ""will have complete access and whatever resources necessary to complete the task,"" Mueller said.","FBI ""policies, practices and actions"" before Fort Hood massacre are under review .

"New York (CNN) -- The father of a 4-year-old boy tortured and beaten to death in New York will be freed from jail to attend his son's funeral, authorities said Thursday. Myls Dobson was found unconscious and unresponsive January 8 on the floor of a bathroom at The Ritz Plaza, a luxury high-rise in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. He had been subjected to weeks of abuse, allegedly at the hands of his caregiver. Myls was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The boy's father, Okee Wade, 37, who has a lengthy arrest record, pleaded guilty in New Jersey Thursday to a charge of second-degree racketeering in connection with an elaborate bank fraud scheme. A judge ordered him released on his own recognizance until February 6 to attend his son's funeral, according to the state attorney general's office. Wade was arrested days after dropping his son off with a caregiver in mid-December. ""I'm letting you out to go give your son a proper burial,"" New Jersey Superior Court Judge Michael A. Donio said Thursday. Wade must turn himself in February 6 and will be sentenced on February 21. Under the plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend a sentence of five years in state prison, but the judge warned that he faces up to 20 years if he fails to turn himself in. ""If you don't come back in three weeks,"" the judge said, ""the terms of this plea agreement go out the window."" A memorial service for Myls will be held Tuesday night at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem. An adviser to Myls' mother, Ashlee Dobson, said the father is welcome at the service ""as long as he doesn't come and start anything."" ""The father's family -- Myls' grandmother and grandfather -- have been participating in preparations and will be flying the baby's body for burial in a family plot in his native South Carolina,"" said the adviser, Tony Herbert. ""He is a father. It's his child. We'll be in a church. We have to forgive."" Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday. She has been charged with first-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawful imprisonment. A prosecutor told the court last week that King also was being investigated on suspicion of murder and faced additional charges. The indictment will be unsealed February 5. In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: ""My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her. I would tell everyone not jump to any conclusions at this time."" On Wednesday, Konoski did not return a call seeking comment. Also on Wednesday, Myls' body was claimed from the morgue in New York. In the final weeks of his brief life, Myls suffered unspeakable acts of neglect and violence, according to a criminal complaint. The boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles, court papers said. There were bruises and numerous marks made by an object on his abdomen and legs and wrists -- bruises consistent with being restrained -- lacerations to his fingers, abrasions to his armpit, and bruises and scars on his back. The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said. King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch December 17 and that she was the ""child's primary and sole caretaker"" until the time of his death, the complaint said. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called Myls' death tragic and ordered a full report on what happened by the end of this week. ""Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop,"" he said. ""And god forbid when they happen, it is our job to learn from them and try to every time do better so we can reach more children.""","Father of tortured 4-year-old to be released from jail for son's funeral .

"(CNN) -- According to a recent study by the National Sleep Foundation, about one in every four married or cohabitating Americans claim they're so sleep-deprived that they're often too tired to have sex. It's not surprising why sleep trumps sex: Between work, family and social obligations, our need for shuteye often suffers. Add in problems such as financial stress, health issues and relationship woes, and you can see why sex tends to drop to the bottom of our ""to do"" list -- if it's on there at all. And when we do finally hit the sheets, many of us are more apt to hold onto our smart phone, tablet or other gadget than our partner's hand. ""Many of us are multitasking throughout the day for extended periods of time -- constant stimulation that can allow for enriching experiences,"" says Amy Levine, sex coach and founder of Ignite Your Pleasure. ""However, that can also take its toll on our sex lives."" In some cases, though, simple exhaustion isn't the only reason why sex takes a backseat to sleep. Unless you've been diagnosed with a health condition that saps energy, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, it's possible that factors other than a busy lifestyle are at play. Are men 'sexually fluid?' ""Boredom could be to blame,"" Levine says. ""If you think or feel sex is going to be status quo, it will feel like a chore rather than something that's satisfying."" Also likely: a low sex drive. According to a 2008 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, between one-third and one-half of all women will find themselves coping with low sexual desire at some point in their lives. And while we're lacking such strong statistics for men, I and many other experts believe that low libido is increasingly becoming a problem for guys, too. Although any number of factors could be to blame for these dips in desire, many of the same triggers that make us exhausted -- like stress, anxiety, worry -- are also linked to decreased desire in both men and women. Some people may confuse a low libido with being too tired for sex; for others, exhaustion itself seems to trigger a lower sex drive. ""A lot of women are satisfied with their relationships and enjoy sex once it's under way but are just too tired and stressed to feel sexual desire,"" explains Laurie Mintz, a University of Florida professor of psychology and the author of ""A Tired Woman's Guide to Passionate Sex."" The book was shown in a published study of 45 women to significantly increase sexual desire, arousal, satisfaction and overall sexual functioning in those who followed the book's program. Fortunately, there's much you can do to create both the time and energy to make sex a regular part of your routine again. Try these steps to get back on track: . Get on a regular sleep schedule . It's the end of a long day, the kids are finally in bed, and all you and your partner want to do is -- well, veg out in front of the TV, or putter around on the Internet, or play a few rounds of Words with Friends. Says Patty Brisben, educator and founder of PureRomance.com, ""The average American spends 2.7 hours a day watching TV, according to the American Time Use Survey. So you have to ask yourself which is more important to you: your relationship or American Idol?"" Try to stick to a regular bedtime, and devote the last hour or so of your waking time to your partner. Even if you do nothing more than cuddle, you're setting a schedule that allows time for more when you're ready. Eventually, your mood will follow. Stay-at-home dads are sexy . Think outside the box . It's easy to say, ""Let's have sex tonight,"" early in the day when your energy is still high. Yet most of us wait until nighttime to get intimate, and by then we're often too tired to make a move. ""Some people are more aroused during the day than at night,"" Levine says. ""Make your arousal pattern work with your schedule and that of your partner so you can enjoy physical intimacy."" That might mean indulging in morning sex before work or a lunchtime quickie -- whatever works for you. Make a date . Think scheduled sex is boring? Not necessarily. There's a common assumption that spontaneous sex is best, but ""planned encounters help build anticipation and relieve tension within your relationship,"" Mintz says. Get a sitter and head out for date night, play hooky from work, or make time for sex when the kids are at a friend's house, for example. Adds Brisben, ""Scheduling sex is great for someone who loves to make a 'to-do' list. You know you're not going to sleep until that box is checked off. Plus, it'll establish a pattern of healthy sexual behavior. They say it takes 21 days to form a habit. Once that habit is formed, you won't want to go to sleep unless you've had sex."" Just do it . It can be tough to feel aroused when all you want to do it sleep. But stick with it. Like other forms of exercise, ""sex can give you an energetic buzz,"" Levine says. ""You just have to be willing to push past the feeling of tiredness to experience the pleasure that will ultimately recharge you. ""If you shift your schedule so you get enough sleep and reprioritize your day to the essentials,"" Levine says, ""being tired doesn't have to be a factor that influences your sex life."" And remember, sex begets sex. Once you get back into the swing of things, you're likely to start wanting to get -- and stay -- intimate more often. When you wake up and smell the coffee, it will smell all the better for having had sex the night before.

"(CNN) -- I have a bright, funny 12-year-old son. He plays a mean game of basketball, loves strawberry banana smoothies and spends way too much time texting on his iPhone. And, if you believe a new study just released, there's a 50-50 chance he'll end up in handcuffs sometime before he turns 23. A report from the University of South Carolina and the University of Albany released this month in the journal Crime & Delinquency argued that by the time they reach age 23, nearly one in two black males (49%) will have been arrested. And the study doesn't even count arrests in minor traffic violations. One out of two. And for white males, there is almost a 40% chance they will have been arrested by 23, according to the report. For Latino males, its 44%. Females fare slightly better. By age 23, arrest rates were 20% for white females, 18% for Latinas and 16% black females. Looking deeper into the study, it showed that for younger boys -- those of any race who have yet to turn 18 -- there is about a one in four chance they'll get arrested. That is stunning, no matter what race you are. There are critics of the study who say that methodology is flawed, that ""it is more of an experiment about handling missing waves of data from a longitudinal sample than a meaningful study about race, gender and crime,"" Ivory A. Toldson, an author and Ph.D researcher at Howard University, said in an article on TheRoot.com. But even if the number is off by half, it's still alarming. Can you imagine the impact of your young son -- or grandson, or nephew, or cousin or brother -- having to look down the barrel of a police officer's gun, or having his wrists forcibly twisted behind his back and handcuffed in public? And, in many cases, all before he is old enough to vote. Or drive. Or get a job. Can you imagine how that young boy will grow up to be a man? Can you imagine his feelings toward the police -- many of whom are trying as hard as they can to keep the streets safe -- who put those handcuffs on him? Will he trust them? Will he respect them? Or will he fear them? Now, can you imagine the difficulties when that same young man goes to get a job? Many employers ask you at the end of that job application form whether you have ever been arrested. These kids will forever have to check the YES box, hoping they get the chance to explain away the circumstances later. But we know most will never make it to the first interview. The study's author put it in context. ""A problem is that many males -- especially black males -- are navigating the transition from youth to adulthood with the baggage and difficulties from contact with the criminal justice system,"" said Robert Brame, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and lead author of the report. Ours is a society that lives in fear. A society that has created a multibillion-dollar industry based on locking people up. We want our cops to protect us, to confront first, arrest next, then resolve later. Sure, crime is a real problem in America, although the crime rate has been steadily declining for more than the past decade, according to the FBI. So has the rate of young black men entering accredited four-year colleges, compared to black females and others. But the unemployment rate among those same young men -- many of whom had to check that YES box on the application -- is still more than twice that of the population at large, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As a father, I will do everything I can to make sure my son is not one of the 50% who get arrested, but instead among the 50% who don't. I am determined that my son will do great in school, stay away from the wrong element in the streets and, by 23, will have hopefully graduated from college, gone on to graduate school or started his first job in the real world (and moved out of the house, for sure!) But it just angers me that, in 2014, I now have to teach him, along with how to tie a tie, how to write a proper resume and how to open the door for a lady, how he must behave when confronted by the police. Keep your hands at 10 and 2. Don't make any fast moves. Don't talk back. And do what they ask of you. And maybe, just maybe, you won't end up on your knees, hands behind your back, feeling the cold of the steel around your wrists. Maybe... The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bryan Monroe .","Recent report says black males have a 50% chance of being arrested by age 23 .

"(CNN) -- Washington's governor has unilaterally imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in his state, saying Tuesday there are ""too many doubts"" and ""too many flaws"" raised about its application. In a statement, Gov. Jay Inslee said he is suspending executions while he is in office, meaning he will issue reprieves when any capital cases come to his desk for action. He said his decision comes after a months-long internal review that included input from law enforcement and families of murder victims. Inslee concluded the death penalty was inconsistently applied. ""Equal justice under the law is the state's primary responsibility. And in death penalty cases, I'm not convinced equal justice is being served,"" the first-term Democratic governor said. ""The use of the death penalty in this state is unequally applied, sometimes dependent on the budget of the county where the crime occurred."" The governor's executive action will not definitively end future use of capital punishment in Washington -- that would take action from the legislature or voters -- nor will death row sentences automatically be commuted or pardons issued. Nine murderers, all men, remain on Washington's death row, at Walla Walla State Penitentiary. Five men have been executed since 1976, when the Supreme Court allowed the practice to resume. Two of the condemned inmates died by hanging, in 1993 and 1994. The last execution in the state was in 2010, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Lethal injection remains the primary method, but a shortage of drugs nationwide has led other states to seek new pharmaceutical sources and methods, or effectively postpone executions. Inslee said his action had nothing to do with mercy. ""Let me say clearly that this policy decision is not about the nine men on death row in Walla Walla,"" he said. ""I don't question their guilt or the gravity of their crimes. They get no mercy from me. This action does not commute their sentences or issue any pardons to any offender. But I do not believe their horrific offenses override the problems that exist in our capital punishment system."" State law gives Inslee the authority to stop death warrants from being issued. Civil rights groups applauded the move. ""This announcement marks an important step forward for Washington, and is a victory for the African-American community. Nowhere are disparities between black and white inmates in criminal justice more apparent than in sentences deciding who lives and who dies,"" said Gerald Hankerson, the president of the Alaska, Oregon, and Washington State Area Conference of the NAACP. ""African-American residents are disproportionately represented on death row, and our state is more likely to impose the death penalty on African-American defendants than white defendants convicted of the same crime."" Eighteen states have officially banned capital punishment as a matter of law, including the District of Columbia. Seven others have had a moratorium imposed either by the courts or the governor. Among them was Oregon in 2011. ""It is time for Oregon to consider a different approach. I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer; and I will not allow further executions while I am governor,"" said John Kitzhaber, a Democrat. Both of Oregon's executions since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976 happened during Kitzhaber's first administration as governor, from 1995-2003.","Gov.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The death toll from the mudslides in a northwestern Chinese province now stands at 1,407, state-run Xinhua news agency said Friday, citing the government. At least 358 people are still missing. The mudslides occurred in Zhouqu County in Gansu province. More than 1,700 mudslide evacuees have been living at schools, but will be relocated as students begin their school year. Households will be moved to Shachuan Village, in the western part of the mudslides-leveled county, said Yang Jianguo, a government official in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture which administers Zhouqu. More than 1,000 tents will be erected at a new settlement zone with three tents for each family, said Yang, quoted by Xinhua. ""They probably will have to spend the winter there so winter tents will be used,"" he said. China has been drenched by heavy rains and floods since the end of May and the devastating Gansu mudslides occurred in early August. In southwestern China's Sichuan province, 16 people have been killed and 66 others remained missing in rain-triggered floods and landslides over the past week. Authorities said about 3,600 homes have collapsed, 25,000 others have been damaged, and 55,000 hectares of crops have been flooded. ""Direct economic loss"" was estimated at 6.89 billion yuan ($1.02 billion), the news agency said.","China has been drenched by rains and floods this summer .

"(CNN) -- The folks at Amazon and Google must have been wringing their hands on Monday when Apple CEO Steve Jobs showed off a new service called iTunes Match. That all-important ""one more thing"" from Apple's software presentation is part of the iCloud Web application and storage suite. It was a coup of sorts -- and Apple's win over competitors could be attributed to Jobs' experience at Pixar Animation Studios, which he co-founded. Here's what Apple pulled off: With a free iCloud account, all songs purchased from iTunes can be accessed from any Apple gadget or computer with iTunes installed. (Amazon has done something similar with Cloud Drive.) For $25 a year, iTunes in the Cloud stores a maximum of 25,000 songs on Apple's servers, ready to access from various gizmos. And, importantly, Apple did this with the blessing of the music industry. Amazon and Google, on the other hand, couldn't get the record labels to agree to their terms. Cloud Drive and Google's Music Beta require users to upload every single track to their servers, a process that can take hours or days. Apple, the largest music retailer, somehow managed to convince the labels and publishers to go along with its plan to use a scan-and-match process. iTunes Match looks at the user's music library and grants the keys to high-quality versions of those songs. It uses a don't-ask-don't-tell policy: Napster who? How did Apple pull off something Amazon and Google couldn't, despite them launching cloud-music services first? For one, Apple has a history with the music industry as long as any technology company's. ""It's really hard to get the labels to give you the rights that you need,"" Jobs said in a 2003 interview at the first All Things Digital conference. ""And I don't see them sprinkling those rights around everywhere, letting a thousand flowers grow quite yet."" In that interview eight years ago, Jobs described the vast divide between technology and entertainment executives, and he talked about how he bridged it. ""One of the things I learned at Pixar is the technology industries and the content industries do not understand each other,"" he said. ""In Silicon Valley and at most technology companies, I swear that most people still think the creative process is a bunch of guys in their early 30s, sitting on a couch, drinking beer and thinking of jokes. No, they really do. That's how television is made, they think; that's how movies are made."" Likewise, record executives can't relate to technical people, Jobs said. ""People in Hollywood and in the content industries, they think technology is something you just write a check for and buy,"" Jobs said. ""They don't understand the creative element of technology. ""These are like ships passing in the night,"" the Apple co-founder added. Music execs also may have seen Google as an enemy because its search engine is a popular place to find websites serving pirated albums, according to an article in the Hollywood Reporter. For the ribbon-cutting of the iTunes Store in 2003, Apple broke through the barriers with a list of predictions, Jobs said. Apple executives provided the record labels with a glimpse into their crystal ball, and nine months later, Jobs' team was getting calls from the music companies, he said. ""The record companies, the most important thing they do is not distribute music,"" Jobs said. ""It's picking which of 500 people are going to be the next Sheryl Crow. That's what they do. And some of them do it quite well. And it's an intuitive process. There's not enough data."" (Hey, Sheryl Crow, remember her?) ""It's not surprising that they didn't understand Napster,"" Jobs said. ""It's not surprising that they didn't understand that distributing their content over the Internet was the next big wave."" Because technology companies treat record labels like clearing houses for content, Silicon Valley bigwigs have trouble getting through the door, Jobs suggested. So it was perhaps Jobs' expertise from Pixar, during his exodus period from Apple, that has given him the edge to secure risky deals with entertainment giants first.","Apple is the first big tech company to secure cloud music storage deals .
The record companies may have taken a bet on Apple because of their history together .

"(CNN) -- Venezuela has revoked or denied press credentials for CNN journalists in the country, following the president's announcement he would expel CNN if it did not ""rectify"" its coverage of anti-government protests. ""They want to show the world that there is a civil war in Venezuela,"" President Nicolas Maduro said Thursday in a televised speech. Anti-government protests have become a daily occurrence in the country, and clashes with security forces or pro-government supporters have resulted in at least eight deaths, officials said. What CNN is not showing, Maduro said, is ""the people working, studying, building the homeland."" ""Enough war propaganda. I do not accept war propaganda against Venezuela. If they do not rectify things, get out of Venezuela, CNN, get out,"" Maduro said, to applause from his pro-government audience. ""Fuera! Fuera!"" people in the crowd shouted -- ""Out! Out!"" Hours later, government officials notified seven journalists for CNN International and CNN en Español that their press accreditation had been denied or revoked. CNN teams from outside Venezuela were told to book flights back to their home countries. Maduro described CNN's journalists with some of the same adjectives he uses for his political opponents. ""A group of fascists with their aggressions want to take us away from peace,"" Maduro said. ""They are not going to do that. And we are going to show them."" When members of the CNN International team were told their credentials were denied, they were asked several times when they would be leaving the country. While the journalists were asked to leave, CNN International and CNN en Español continue to broadcast in Venezuela. CNN has repeatedly asked for a meeting with officials, and a CNN reporter has been invited to a news conference where Maduro will speak later Friday afternoon. CNN en Español's correspondent in Caracas was also invited to the event. ""CNN has reported both sides of the tense situation in Venezuela, even with very limited access to government officials,"" CNN en Español said in a statement, adding that at the time its credentials were revoked, CNN was seeking an interview with the president. ""We hope the government will reconsider its decision. Meanwhile, we will continue reporting on Venezuela in the fair, accurate and balanced manner we are known for."" A top legislative leader for the ruling party said the government will investigate the allegations against CNN, and will not ""tremble in acting against those who make an attempt against the motherland."" The move to revoke CNN's press credentials comes after weeks of protests that mark the largest demonstrations Maduro has faced in his 11 months in power following the death of President Hugo Chavez. Government authorities and opposition leaders have blamed each other for deaths resulting from the violence. Leopoldo Lopez, an opposition leader in Venezuela, faces arson and conspiracy charges in connection with the unrest. Lopez, who has denied the charges, is being held in a military prison outside Caracas. Venezuela also expelled three U.S. diplomats this week, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government -- an accusation that the State Department has repeatedly denied.","CNN journalists are denied credentials to report in Venezuela .

"(CNN) -- Colombia laid out its case against Venezuela Thursday in front of the Organization of American States. In a lengthy speech before an emergency meeting of the hemispheric body, Colombian Ambassador Luis Alfonso Hoyos provided photos he said were evidence of rebel camps in Venezuela belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the National Liberation Army, or ELN. At the end of Thursday's meetings, the member countries reached an agreement to cooperate on a unified front against drug trafficking and terrorism. However, the body did not come down in favor of one side or another in the latest spat between Colombia and Venezuela. Stoking the flames in a long-simmering fire between the two countries, Colombia accused Venezuela of not acting on information that Colombian rebels were safeguarded in Venezuela. On Thursday, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez responded by announcing that his country would sever diplomatic ties with Colombia. ""Some activity from these last weeks show there is real danger that is materializing by that consolidated, active and growing presence of terrorist groups in the brother country of Venezuela,"" Hoyos said during Colombia's presentation. He said that since 2000, there has been a 50 percent decrease in the number of murders in that country, and a 96 percent drop in kidnappings since President Alvaro Uribe took office eight years ago. Hoyos showed photos of an alleged FARC attack on June 20 in the Colombian city of Arauquita, near the Venezuelan border. The rebels came across the border and attacked the Colombians from a base in Venezuela, Hoyos said. In all, the FARC has 1,500 rebels in Venezuela, Hoyos said. Many of the photos and intelligence came from rebel defectors, Hoyos said, adding that Venezuela has not acted on the information given to them by Colombian authorities. ""Of course Colombia is open to cooperation, but it has to be based on reality, not in rhetoric, insults or attacks,"" Hoyos said. Colombia asked for an international commission to be formed that would visit the locations where Colombia alleges rebels are camped out, to confirm its findings. ""You want a solution? Here it is. Name one moral reason that should impede this -- none. To the contrary, it would be completely immoral, criminal and murderous to impede this from happening,"" Hoyos said. Venezuela's ambassador to the OAS, Roy Chaderton, denied that any of the evidence presented by Colombia proved that rebels were in his country. ""They are very curious photos,"" Chaderton said, adding, ""(taken) from I don't know where."" The terrain between Colombia and Venezuela looks very similar, he said. Some of the alleged photos showing a rebel leader at a beach appeared to have been taken in Colombia and not Venezuela, he said. Despite Hoyos' statistics, Chaderton said that violence and drug trafficking continue in Colombia. ""The FARC, the ELN, and the paramilitaries are a Colombian phenomena and remain in Colombia because the president who most bragged about getting rid of them couldn't complete his promises,"" Chaderton said. Colombia was stirring the conflict by pressing for the emergency meeting of the OAS while ignoring calls from third parties for more time for consultations, he said. ""This does harm to the Organization of American States,"" he said.","Colombia provided what it calls evidence of rebels in Venezuela .
The Colombian ambassador said Venezuela has not acted on intelligence it has received .

"(CNN) -- An alarm late Friday night indicating higher than usual levels of airborne radiation led to a first-of-its-kind response at a nuclear disposal facility outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico, an Energy Department spokesman told CNN. An air monitor at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant detected the spike in an isolated area half a mile below the ground. The incident prompted an immediate shutoff of filtered air from the facility into the environment around it. ""This is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside,"" Energy Department spokesman Gregory Sahd told CNN. Investigators from the Department of Energy expect test results this week to help determine whether there was a radiation leak. Officials believe there is no danger to the community because it was quickly contained. The radiation was first detected at 11:30 p.m., according to Sahd. He said the facility's ventilation system monitors air quality in real time and automatically switched to ""filtration mode"" when the possible leak was discovered. Due to the late hour and the location of the incident, Sahd said there was little risk to employees. Those who were inside the above-ground area of the facility responded quickly and remained quarantined until radiological control technicians cleared them to go home. ""No one was underground when the alarm went off,"" Sahd said. ""And everyone that was in the facility (at the time), we know where they are and we've tested them."" Sahd said there have been no injuries reported, and the area officials believe was affected has been closed off. ""We're pretty sure we know where it's at."" New Mexico Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich said in a statement Saturday that they remain in contact with Energy Department officials. ""We will continue to monitor the situation as more information becomes available. The safety of WIPP personnel and the surrounding community is of the utmost importance.""","Higher levels of airborne radiation trip alarm, shutoff of filtered air .

"(CNN) -- Even when Chelsea held a nine-point lead over Manchester City atop English football's Premier League, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho always maintained his team wasn't the favorite. He is being proved right -- with Saturday not helping the Blues. Chelsea suffered a shock 1-0 loss at relegation threatened Crystal Palace and hours later saw Manchester City gain a point thanks to a 1-1 draw at Arsenal. It might have been worse for Chelsea, since City led 1-0. ""I think it is now impossible to win the title,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports before the Manchester City game. ""We depend too much on other results."" Chelsea still leads the standings by a point over Liverpool and two over City but City has two games in hand and Liverpool will go top if it earns a point Sunday at home against Tottenham. Manchester City, fresh off a convincing victory in the Manchester derby, took a deserved lead in London in the 18th minute when David Silva was the quickest to react after Edin Dzeko's left-footed shot struck the post. Arsenal appeared listless, perhaps the result of losing 6-0 at Chelsea last week and then dropping more points against Swansea. But the Gunners were a different side in the second half, leveling through defensive midfielder Mathieu Flamini in the 53rd. And Arsenal almost took the lead, Joe Hart stopping Lukas Podolski with City creaking. In the end City seemed happy to take a point judging by manager Manuel Pellegrini's substitutions. ""We played better in the first half,"" Pellegrini told Sky Sports. Although Chelsea tallied more than 20 shots, only two were on goal and none managed to beat keeper Julian Speroni. Speroni twice thwarted Chelsea's offensive star, Eden Hazard. John Terry, so solid for Chelsea this season, gave Palace a valuable three points with an own goal in the 52nd minute. Mourinho didn't blame Terry and in fact praised his four main defenders as a whole. However, he added: ""You have other players who are fantastic in some matches and disappear in other matches."" Manchester United has struggled in its first season under David Moyes but there were boos when a banner flew above Old Trafford calling for the Scot's departure. Wayne Rooney -- a week after his wonder goal from the halfway mark against West Ham -- scored twice in United's 4-1 lunchtime win over Aston Villa. Rooney was substituted in the second half, days ahead of United's Champions League quarterfinal against title holder Bayern Munich. Elsewhere, English trio Rickie Lambert, Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana shone for Southampton again in a 4-0 home win against Newcastle; and relegation contenders West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City played to a 3-3 draw after both scored deep in injury time. Stoke and Swansea further eased their relegation worries by defeating Hull 1-0 and Norwich 3-0, respectively.","Chelsea suffers a shock 1-0 loss at relegation threatened Crystal Palace .

"Washington (CNN) -- Additional details surfaced Thursday pointing to similarities between the bombs found in packages mailed from Yemen last week and a failed attempt to blow up a plane as it landed in Detroit, Michigan, last year. Investigators have found syringes associated with the explosives found last week, a U.S. official said. FBI agents investigating the failed attack on the plane landing in Detroit on December 25 found what appeared to be the remnants of a syringe. They made the discovery near the seat of Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, a 25-year-old Nigerian citizen who faces charges including attempted murder. Investigators say he tried to blow up a plane with an explosive that was partly sewn into his underwear. Experts have said that the bomber probably used a liquid in a syringe with a chemical he was carrying; that would have created a fire and ignited the explosives. It is the latest connection to be found between both incidents. PETN, a powerful explosive, was used in the parcel bomb plot and last year's foiled bombing. And officials believe that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was responsible for both plots. ""This was AQAP,"" the U.S. official said Thursday. ""The body of information that people have reviewed over the past several days points very directly to AQAP. ""AQAP has shown a strong interest, and regrettably skill, in dealing with PETN, but that wouldn't be the only reason why this government would reach the conclusion that they are responsible. There is other information, too."" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano recently said the two devices found on freight planes in the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom last week have ""all the hallmarks"" of a plot by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based arm of the terrorist network. The same group also claimed responsibility for the December bombing attempt. The most recent security threat came to light Friday, when authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two packages sent from Yemen with explosives that were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. The devices were packed in computer printer toner cartridges and designed to be detonated by a cell phone, a source close to the investigation said. The detonating substance was lead azide, a ""very powerful initiator"" that is easily prepared and is a standard substance in detonations, a source closely involved in the investigation said. The U.S. official said that testing on the devices is ongoing, but the assumption at this point is that the lead azide in the syringe was supposed to be an improvised blasting cap. When the circuit was completed, a wire in the syringe would heat up and ignite the lead azide, the official said. That would set off the PETN. One of the parcel bombs was disarmed minutes before it was due to explode, French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux told French TV on Thursday in Paris. ""One parcel has been defused, one of the parcel bombs, was defused only 17 minutes before the time of the blast,"" Hotefeux said on France 2. The White House and other U.S. officials are not confirming the French minister's assertion. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that Britain and UAE investigators have the packages. ""The investigators are looking into all features of the investigation,"" Gibbs said. ""Obviously, since those were to be loaded on U.S. carriers, the FBI is deeply involved. ""The forensics are very tedious, meticulous. ... We have confidence in that investigation, and when it's concluded, we'll look forward to that investigation being made public ... but I have no information to confirm that fact."" Investigators in Yemen say they suspect that Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, al Qaeda's top bomb maker in the region, is behind the explosive devices sent in the parcels. U.S. authorities are said to be also looking at al-Asiri because PETN was used in the parcels and by the underwear bomber. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Jill Dougherty and Becky Brittain contributed to this report.","Al Qaeda's Yemen wing is suspected in last week's bomb plot .

"London, England (CNN) -- An explosive device found in a cargo plane in England last month probably would have exploded over the Eastern Seaboard of the United States if it had not been discovered, Scotland Yard said Wednesday. The device was primed to explode about six hours after it was found, a senior U.S. counterterrorism source told CNN. ""Forensic examination has indicated that if the device had activated it would have been at 10:30 hrs BST on Friday, 29 October 2010,"" the Scotland Yard statement said. ""If the device had not been removed from the aircraft the activation could have occurred over the eastern seaboard of the U.S."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based arm of the al Qaeda terrorist network, claimed responsibility last week for the plot to send explosive devices on cargo planes bound for the United States. White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said the findings by British authorities ""underscore the serious nature of the attempted AQAP attack and the challenge we all face in trying to prevent or disrupt such attacks."" Shapiro cited ""the collective efforts of many dedicated intelligence and law enforcement professionals"" in the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and the United States for disrupting the attacks. ""The United States will continue to work closely with these partners and the government of Yemen to address and counter the threat posed by AQAP as well as to provide humanitarian and economic assistance to help shape a stable and secure Yemen,"" Shapiro said. In a similar statement later Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano noted the United States increased screening requirements for air cargo this week and has worked in the past year to make air security a global issue by working with the International Civil Aviation Organization. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two explosives-laden packages sent from Yemen on October 29 that were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. The statement by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the two cargo explosives, as well as the September 3 crash of a UPS plane near Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. It said that because Western media did not link the September crash to the group, ""we decided not to announce it so we could carry on a similar operation."" ""We did that this time using two devices, one of which was sent via the American UPS company and the other via the American FedEx company,"" the statement said. In a security bulletin dated Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI concluded the AQAP statement was authentic, but they dismissed the group's claim that it was involved in the September UPS plane crash. ""We assess the statement is authentic and AQAP's claim of responsibility for shipping the two explosive-laden packages discovered and disrupted on 29 October 2010 is credible,"" the bulletin said. ""The group likely considers the plot a success since its devices evaded cargo screening procedures and likely will cause Western nations to implement costly security countermeasures."" According to the bulletin, AQAP's ""assertion of responsibility for the 3 September 2010 crash of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai is false."" ""Other terrorist organizations have falsely claimed credit for events with a high media profile to bolster their image and external perceptions of their operational capabilities,"" the bulletin said. Also Wednesday, a U.S. official said there was no evidence so far that the September 3 UPS crash near Dubai involved terrorism. ""It is not surprising that they would issue such a claim of responsibility,"" the official said of the AQAP statement. ""As we have said, we are continuing to take another look at the Dubai crash but nothing thus far has indicated any nexus to terrorism. The available information continues to indicate that the crash was an accident."" On October 31, the UAE government announced an investigation of the crash by its General Civil Aviation Authority had eliminated the possibility that an on-board explosion was the cause. The two devices that were found on cargo planes, both loaded with the powerful explosive PETN, were packed in computer printer toner cartridges and designed to be detonated by a cell phone, a source close to the investigation has said. U.S. investigators believe that al Qaeda bombmaker Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, 28, is linked to the packages, according to a federal official who was briefed by authorities. Al-Asiri, who is thought to be in Yemen, is a Saudi who ranked high on Saudi Arabia's list of most wanted fugitives published in February 2009. He is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year's failed attempt to blow up a U.S. airliner as it landed in Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. A U.S. official said that the devices found in the packages last month were very sophisticated and could have exploded in flight, but it wasn't clear whether that was the intent. The group's statement said the devices' designs ""allow us the opportunity to detonate them in the air or after their arrival to their ultimate destination, and they are designed to pass through all detectors."" The packages were discovered thanks to a tip from Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials provided tracking numbers of the two packages bound for Jewish organizations in the United States, enabling quick tracing to the United Kingdom and Dubai, a source told CNN. After the incidents, U.S. government authorities grounded packages originating from Yemen destined for the United States. Yemen has asked for outside help to thwart terror groups, but the country, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, is still used for operations, U.S. officials say. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. security bulletin dismisses AQAP claim involving Dubai crash .

"Aleppo, Syria (CNN) -- Journalists often get invited on tours of battle zones during wars, but the one the Syrian government organized for CNN and several other media outlets Wednesday was more than bizarre. We had been told we were going on a trip to the front line in Damascus. Instead, we were driven to an airfield and packed into an old Soviet-made Yakovlev YAK-40 aircraft. It wasn't until we were in the air that government officials on the flight finally offered up some information. ""We are going to Aleppo,"" one said with a smile. He told reporters that ours would be the first civilian aircraft to land at the city's international airport since December 2012, when the airfield was shut because of heavy clashes in the area. We sat still, slightly nervous about the guinea pig role we had been thrust into by the government, as our pilot performed a spectacular combat landing on a foggy day. As the aircraft taxied toward the terminal we finally realized that we were the news of the day. A live transmission vehicle and dozens of reporters were waiting to greet us as Syrian government TV carried the live banner proclaiming ""The reopening of Aleppo Airport and the landing of a commercial flight."" EXCLUSIVE: Gruesome photos could prove torture by Assad regime . Mohammed Wahid al Akad, Aleppo's provincial governor, was on hand to greet us, eager to show us the gains that Syrian forces had made in and around the city -- and also talk about the ongoing negotiations in Switzerland between representatives of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and various opposition factions. ""What we want from Geneva is to stop foreign money, fighters and weapons coming into Syria. We as Syrians can reconcile with each other, make our own government to rebuild our country,"" he said. Three buses picked us up for a tour of areas the military had recently taken back from rebels. Aleppo and its surrounding areas are a key battleground in Syria's hard-fought, nearly three-year-old civil war. The killings have been far too numerous to count. In December, overwhelmed doctors scurried to help scores of patients amid days of air raids by the government. ""There was a big massacre today,"" Dr. Ammar Zakaria told CNN at the time. ""We were treating shrapnel wounds, deep abdominal and brain injuries. I just lost count of the amputations."" For a long time it appeared opposition forces might take full control of Syria's largest city. But infighting among various rebel groups and a resurgent Syrian army has reversed momentum. The government soldiers we spoke with sounded confident and emboldened by their recent gains. ""Al Qaeda were the worst people to fight against. They are Islamists, they see us as infidels and they want to kill us,"" one soldier said. As the buses drove us to the town of Tal Hassil near the airport, people lined the streets, chanting pro-Assad slogans. We were not sure how spontaneous this show of affection really was. We were taken to an aid distribution center before the tour took us to regime-held areas of Aleppo. PHOTOS: Haunting images of Aleppo's abandoned homes . The city has the same remarkable dynamic as many other Syrian cities during the civil war, including Homs and Damascus. As the mortars boom and machine guns crackle during heavy clashes in many parts of town, other neighborhoods seem totally normal, to an almost absurd extent. The United Nations and other international groups accuse Syrian regime forces of using heavy weapons against civilian areas, including barrel bombs -- oil drums filled with explosives that cause massive destruction wherever they are dropped. But in many government-controlled parts of the city, just a few blocks from the fighting, the streets are full of people and the shops are well stocked. There are trendy restaurants and cafÃ©s, even as rebels control almost half of the city. Syrian officials believe that Aleppo could be a model for a ceasefire between regime and rebel forces. But looking over the skyline, it is easy to see just how hard that will be. At a sniper position atop of one of Aleppo's tallest buildings, soldiers showed us areas under opposition control. Some are held by the moderate Free Syrian Army, or the newly-constituted and moderate Islamic Front. But others are under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the al Qaeda-linked group which is battling against other rebel factions in its bid to set up an Islamic caliphate in Syria. Aleppo offered many surprises before we climbed back into our rickety old YAK-40 jet at the end of the day. But it still seems that a ceasefire in the city is a long way off, even if the Geneva negotiations go well.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- A United Nations peacekeeper working to clear landmines died Wednesday in southern Lebanon, according to a spokeswoman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. U.N. peacekeepers have had a presence in Lebanon since 1978 after Israel withdrew. The person died in an explosion as the UNIFIL explosive ordnance disposal team surveyed a field near the village of Aitaroun, where mines are believed to have been planted, according to spokeswoman Yasmina Bouziane. It was UNIFIL's second mine-related death since 2006, she said. ""UNIFIL medical and explosive ordnance disposal teams were immediately dispatched to the location and an investigation is under way,"" she said. She would not disclose the person's nationality and said she hoped to have more details about how the person was killed when the investigation is completed ""hopefully by tomorrow."" There are about 15,000 UNIFIL troops in southern Lebanon. The force was set up in 1978 after Israeli forces withdrew from Lebanon, but more troops were added following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. Last week, the U.N. Security Council extended UNIFIL's mandate for another year until August 2009. Wednesday's death is the first UNIFIL fatality since June, when a Spanish peacekeeper died in a road accident in southern Lebanon. Last year, a bomb attack hit a UNIFIL vehicle in June, killing six peacekeepers. A French peacekeeper with UNIFIL died a month later while clearing unexploded ordnance left over from the 2006 war. While it is unclear what type of device killed the member of the explosive ordinance disposal team on Wednesday, the United Nations has warned that the area is still covered in cluster munitions from the 2006 conflict. Last month, the head of the U.N. Mine Action Coordination Center of South Lebanon said it has removed half of the cluster munitions that were planted in southern Lebanon during the 34-day conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. CNN's Nada Husseini in Beirut contributed to this report.","U.N. peacekeeper dies during attempt to remove unexploded ordnance .

"(CNN) -- A North Dakota judge Wednesday halted the imminent implementation of a law that threatened to shut down the state's only abortion clinic by mandating that physicians involved in the practice have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The preliminary injunction blocks the law, SB 2305, from going into effect as scheduled on Thursday. ""This is not meant to denigrate the deep and profound convictions of those who oppose abortion, but nothing can be gained by fueling the passions that drive this 'intensely divisive controversy,'"" Judge Wickham Corwin said in his ruling. The ruling makes SB 2305 the latest North Dakota law on abortion that a court has blocked in recent weeks. A federal judge earlier this month temporarily blocked the enforcement of a law banning abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The legislation affected by Wednesday's ruling required ""all physicians performing abortion procedures (to) have admitting privileges at a hospital located within 30 miles of the abortion facility, and staff privileges to replace hospital on-staff physicians at that hospital."" ""These privileges must include the abortion procedures the physician will be performing at abortion facilities,"" the law adds. As Corwin points out, putting the law into effect would force the closure of Red River Women's Clinic -- a place where ""all abortions ... are completed long before the fetus becomes viable (and) are extremely safe and effective."" Its staff, until now, had no reason to be affiliated with a local hospital, much less be approved to perform abortions at such facilities. The judge noted that a Catholic hospital and a veteran's hospital -- neither of which perform abortions -- are within the 30-mile radius, as is one other hospital that requires doctors with admitting privileges to ""generate the specified minimum volume of business."" Early stage abortions ""are relatively simple procedures, performed on an outpatient basis"" in clinics without need for hospitalization, he added. The ""old argument"" that the women need to be near hospitals should ""grave complications"" arise has been ""dispelled,"" according to Corwin. ""It is hard to envision how a compelling need for state regulation could ever exist,"" the judge said. ""In any event, the existing record clearly fails to suggest any need for the requirements imposed in SB 2305."" Tammi Kromenaker, the director of the Red River Women's Clinic, expressed satisfaction with Corwin's ruling and the fact that it means North Dakotans ""will continue to have the same rights as women across the United States."" ""The judge clearly stated that these attempts to contrive safety concerns continue to be wrong-headed, and that the (North Dakota) constitution does include protections for women seeking abortions,"" Kromenaker said.

"(CNN) -- Maps can be beautiful and good ones can be great investments. But what collectors often find most entrancing about maps are how they provide portals into history. The rise and fall of cities, the charting of war and adventure, the promise of riches through trade ... history continues to be rewritten according to scholars' reinterpretations of ancient cartography. John Selden's 17th-century map of China made a huge splash recently as the stimulus for two new books analyzing London's rise as an economic hub (the city's success is inextricably linked to trade with China, as the Selden map illustrates). According to some experts, the current unprecedented volume of global travel is also contributing to a burgeoning interest in map collecting. ""I believe that as people travel more, migrate more and speak more languages, and as business becomes more globalized, the appeal of two types of attachment to the idea of 'place' increases,"" says Daniel Crouch, a London based specialist of antique maps and atlases. ""One, as an identification with, or memory of, a place or homeland left behind, and the other as a statement of a new 'home' or adopted country, or fondness for a land visited."" Crouch reveals some fascinating map facts gathered from a lifetime of collecting and selling antique maps, and shares favorites from his most recent exhibition in Hong Kong featuring maps of China. 7 things to know about maps . 1. It's still possible to have your own world-class map collection . Even the wealthiest collectors of old master or impressionist paintings, Chinese ceramics or modern art can never hope to have collections of a quality to match the likes of the Louvre, the British Museum or the Met. However, that's not true of maps. The savvy collector can still buy maps or atlases as good as, and sometimes better than, those found in the world's major libraries and museums. ""We have several items in our gallery that are at least as good, if not better, than the equivalent examples in, say, the Bibliotheque Nationale, the British Library or Library of Congress,"" says Crouch, whose gallery keeps approximately 250 maps and 50 atlases in stock at any one time. 2. ""BRIC"" nations are hot right now . Antique maps featuring the world's biggest developing countries have seen a recent spike in prices. According to Crouch this heightened interest can be linked to the recently increased inbound and outbound travel from these countries. ""Maps of B.R.I.C. nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China) have seen the fastest growing markets (and prices) in recent years,"" says Crouch. ""I have also noticed an increased interest in 'thematic' and 19th and even early 20th century mapping,"" he says. 3. The first ""modern"" map was printed more than 500 years ago . While the earliest maps were rudimentary diagrams drawn in caves in pre-historic times, the first proper manuscript maps appeared in the 12th century. The map of the Holy Land printed in the ""Rudimentum Novitiorum,"" an encyclopedia of world history published in 1475, is considered the first modern printed map. A sample of the Rudimentum Novitiorum was sold for Â£500,000 ($829,000) in 2013. 4. Mapmakers included fake towns to catch forgers . Ever been to the town of Agloe in New York State? Whitewall in California? Or Relescent in Florida? While these towns are clearly marked on a number of antique maps of the United States, they don't actually exist. ""Paper towns"" were fake places added to maps by early mapmakers in order to dupe forgers into copying them, thereby exposing themselves to charges of copyright infringement. 5. The world's best map collection is in Paris . ""The best collection in the world, in my opinion, is that of the Bibliotheque Nationale de France in Paris, followed by the Library of Congress in the United States and the British Library,"" says Crouch. ""Many of what we now regard as the major institutional collections of cartography were actually put together by individuals in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the United Kingdom, the best collection of such material was made by King George III."" The latter collection is known as the ""K.Top,"" and can be found in the British Library. 6. The most expensive map was the first to name America . The U.S. Library of Congress paid a record $10 million for German cartographer Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller's Universalis Cosmographia, a wall map of the world printed in 1507. It's the only surviving copy of the map, which was the first to use the name ""America."" In 2007, Crouch brokered the sale of the most expensive atlas ever sold -- the 1477 Bologna Ptolemy, the first printed atlas -- for Â£1.9 million ($3.12 million). 7. The best place to shop for maps is in the Netherlands . The annual European Fine Art and Antiques Fair in Masstricht, Netherlands is often considered the world's best place to shop for antique maps, classic and modern art and jewelry. More than 70,000 people visited the TEFAF Maastricht in 2013 to browse the 260 booths from 20 countries. ""It's simply the biggest and best fine art fair in the world,"" says Crouch. This year's fair dates are March 14-23. TEFAF Maastricht, Maastricht Exhibition & Congress Centre, Forum 100, 6229 GV Maastricht, Netherlands; +31 43 38 38 383; 11 a.m.-7 p.m.","""Paper towns"" were fake places added to maps by mapmakers in order to dupe forgers into copying them .

"(CNN) -- It's a pod-like structure a bit larger than a photo booth, and a Vermont company is hoping it will make life a little easier for nursing mothers who are away from home. The modular lactation station allows a mother to breast-feed her baby or use a breast pump in a private spot designed with her in mind, with Corian surfaces, soft lighting, a fold-down table and even a power supply for a pumping machine. The first one was unveiled Thursday at Burlington International Airport in Vermont and the company behind it, Burlington-based Mamava, is hoping many more will follow. ""We definitely see it for any public space where a mom might need some privacy or might want to use a breast pump,"" company co-founder Sascha Mayer said. Nursing mothers know well the challenges of trying to feed their babies while away from home. Discreet nursing covers or shawls allow a degree of privacy when breast-feeding in public, though some mothers who are still shy about it may do it in a corner or even in a bathroom stall. Mothers who must pump their milk have an even tougher time finding a place to do it in public. A bathroom stall is often the only option, but it's less than desirable -- imagine sitting on a public toilet while balancing a pump (or baby), listening to the sound of flushing toilets all around and knowing other women can hear the kshhh-kshhh of the pump every few seconds. Those realities became clear to Mayer after the birth of her daughter seven years ago, when she had to travel for work. She had to find ways of pumping while at trade shows, airports, corporate retreats, baseball games and rafting trips, so she began thinking of a product that would make things easier for other mothers facing the same challenges. ""We wanted it to be comfortable,"" she said, but at the same time, ""we're not about hiding moms away. We're about giving them an alternative to pumping in public, and an alternative to using a bathroom."" They started working with designers and developed the first prototype earlier this year. The director of Burlington's airport, Gene Richards, liked the idea and the free-standing pod is now installed in the second floor of the terminal, airside, after the security checkpoints. ""Breast-feeding is welcome anywhere at the airport, but the Mamava unit will provide a comfortable place for nursing mothers who might want more privacy (or for babies who might need fewer distractions),"" the company said. There is no fee to use the lactation station. A lock on the door turns red when it's occupied. Mamava hopes to put pods in other airports or public places like conference centers and malls, Mayer says. They're also working on a foldable design that could be used in small workplaces and then put away when not in use. ""What's been really, really fun for us is the cultural challenge,"" Mayer said. As the public becomes more aware of the benefits of breast-feeding, she said she hopes they also become aware of the logistics of it. Mayer said she doesn't want women to choose against breast-feeding just because it's too difficult. ""We really just want to make it a legitimate choice for women, because really in a lot of cases it just isn't,"" Mayer said. ""There are so many challenges, so why not make it as positive and optimistic and comforting as possible?""","The kiosk has Corian surfaces, a fold-down table and a power supply .

"(CNN) -- Two stories of America -- one about its sometimes perverse capacity for reinvention, the other about the most tragic period in the country's history -- were among the leaders Thursday for the nominations for the 86th Academy Awards. ""American Hustle,"" a story about con artists based loosely on the late 1970s Abscam scandal, tied for the lead with 10 nominations. The movie was nominated in several major categories, including picture, director (David O. Russell), actor (Christian Bale), actress (Amy Adams), supporting actor (Bradley Cooper), supporting actress (Jennifer Lawrence) and adapted screenplay. And ""12 Years a Slave,"" based on Solomon Northup's 19th-century narrative about being taken from freedom into slavery, earned nine nods, including picks for best picture, best director (Steve McQueen), best actor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), best supporting actor (Michael Fassbender) and best supporting actress (Lupita Nyong'o). ""This has been an amazing ride, and to receive nine nominations from the academy is testament to all of the hard work. And for that I am truly grateful,"" McQueen said. The complete list of nominees . ""Gravity,"" about a space mission gone wrong, also received 10 nominations, including picks for best picture, best director (Alfonso Cuaron) and best actress (Sandra Bullock). ""I am particularly moved by Sandy's nomination,"" said Cuaron in a statement. ""She is the heartbeat of our film. I thank her for her grace, her trust and her dedication to finding the truth of this character."" The academy nominated nine films for best picture overall. They are ""American Hustle,"" ""Captain Phillips,"" ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" ""Gravity,"" ""Her,"" ""Nebraska,"" ""Philomena,"" ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" CNN Oscar ballot: Make your choices, share your picks . ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" had divided critics -- and, more to the point, industry audiences -- with its relentless depiction of hedonism among financial traders in 1990s New York. In one instance, according to a story that quickly gained currency in Hollywood, an academy member heckled director Martin Scorsese after a screening. But Oscar sided with the film, giving it five nominations, all in big categories: best picture, best director, best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), best supporting actor (Jonah Hill) and best adapted screenplay (Terence Winter). 5 things we learned from Oscar nominations . Love for 'Dallas Buyers Club' There was also good news for ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" the story of an HIV-positive man in the 1980s who rallies others to battle the AIDS crisis. The low-budget film, which cost $5 million, received six nominations, tying it with ""Nebraska"" and ""Captain Phillips."" Matthew McConaughey, who won a Golden Globe for a performance that required him to lose 45 pounds, was among the best actor nominees. The film was also nominated for best supporting actor (Jared Leto, another Globe winner) and best original screenplay, along with best picture. The academy also smiled on director Alexander Payne, a two-time Oscar winner whose films include ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants"" and ""About Schmidt."" His ""Nebraska,"" the story of a curmudgeon and his son who make a trip to the Cornhusker State in the possible vain pursuit of a sweepstakes prize, included nominations for picture, director, original screenplay, supporting actress (June Squibb) and best actor. The last went to 77-year-old film veteran Bruce Dern, whose only other nomination was for 1978's ""Coming Home."" Another sleeper, ""Philomena,"" received nominations for picture, adapted screenplay and star Judi Dench as well as music (original score). As expected, Cate Blanchett also was nominated for best actress as a modern-day Blanche DuBois in ""Blue Jasmine."" She already has won the Golden Globe (drama), National Society of Film Critics Award and New York Film Critics Circle Award for her role in the Woody Allen film. The tireless Meryl Streep was recognized yet again by the academy, receiving a best actress nomination for ""August: Osage County."" It's Streep's 18th nomination. She has three wins, for ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""The Iron Lady."" Hanks, Oprah missing . But not everyone ended up touched by Oscar's golden glow. Perhaps the biggest shocker was the lack of a nomination for Tom Hanks, who pretty much carries ""Captain Phillips"" as the titular seaman. The film did receive nominations for best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor (for former limo driver and Somalia native Barkhad Abdi), but neither Hanks nor director Paul Greengrass ended up with nods. (It also was nominated for film editing, sound editing and sound mixing.) Hanks' other major film, ""Saving Mr. Banks,"" was almost entirely snubbed. Though Emma Thompson was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers, the academy overlooked her in the best actress race, and the film failed to earn a best picture nomination. Oprah Winfrey and the film she starred in, ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" also came up empty. And Robert Redford was expected to make a run at best actor for his almost wordless performance in ""All Is Lost,"" about a lone sailor lost at sea when his boat is damaged. But the 77-year-old actor didn't get a nomination. Pixar, which once a sure thing in the animated feature category, was left off the nominations list again. The nominees for best animated feature are ""The Croods,"" ""Despicable Me 2,"" ""Frozen,"" ""The Wind Rises"" and ""Ernest & Celestine."" DeGeneres promises fun again as Oscar host . The Oscar race now shapes up as a battle between ""Hustle"" and ""12 Years."" Both have their critics. For all the praise ""Hustle"" has received -- including a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy film -- it's been called slick and hammy. McQueen's ""12 Years"" (which received the Golden Globe for best drama) has fewer naysayers, but even those who liked the film noted it's difficult to watch. Slate's Dana Stevens described it as ""overpowering,"" and admitted she was having a hard time finding critical distance from the film's portrayal of brutality. Awards season: Does diversity matter more than wins? ""Buyers Club"" could sneak in. Like ""12 Years,"" it has a high-minded subject the Oscars tend to like, and McConaughey and Leto have been widely touted for their performances. ""Gravity"" may be a longer shot for best picture, but Cuaron's amazing direction -- juggling state-of-the-art, computer-generated imagery with moving performances by Bullock and George Clooney -- has been greatly admired. Of course, as much as the Oscar is about designating the best of Hollywood, it's also supposed to be an entertaining show. This year, Ellen DeGeneres returns as host, and given a short ad shown just before the nominations announcement -- which featured DeGeneres dancing through a back lot accompanied by a growing army of tuxedoed dancers -- it could be a lot of fun. The 86th Academy Awards will air March 2 from Hollywood's Dolby Theatre. The show will be on ABC.

"(CNN) -- On Monday the World Court in the Hague ruled that Japan's ""scientific"" whale-hunting was baloney. It ordered Japan to revoke its ""scientific research"" permits to all its ships, effectively tying Japan's fleet to the dock and silencing the cannons and exploding bombs that are the way whales die nowadays. Japan says it will abide. I wish it would take this opportunity to bow gracefully out of something so dishonest and unfit for modernity. But I expect a fragile truce, and only a partial one. That's because Japan has a history of creatively bending the rules beyond the breaking point of international intent. Authorities and whalers seem committed to killing whales first and finding a rationale second, and it would be no surprise if the program were tweaked in some meaningless way so they could excuse continued hunting. Or they might say the court's ruling applies only in Antarctic waters and not the Pacific, where they also hunt. Or they might simply ignore the ban like their suppliers Norway and Iceland. Come with me to three faraway places and you might see why I feel deeply and strongly about whales. During the week it takes us to circle the ice-crowned sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia, we see exactly two large whales -- and two now-defunct whaling stations. In 1904, the Norwegian whaler C.F. Larsen arrived right here and wrote with astonishment, ""I see them in hundreds and thousands."" During the next 60 years, whalers killed about 2 million whales in the Southern Hemisphere, including about 360,000 blue whales, 200,000 humpbacks, almost 400,000 sperm whales, and a staggering 750,000 fin whales. Many of those whales should still be alive. That's why we haven't seen more whales. Down along the Antarctic Peninsula on a penguin-research expedition, we find that the beach at King George Island is strewn with bigger-than-dinosaur bones of great whales, cast off after the whales were stripped of flesh. A whale vertebrae the size of a hassock makes a good seat for jotting a few notes. Then, like children making up a game, we'll try to walk a couple hundred yards on the bones of whales killed by human beings, without stepping on the sand. It's quite do-able. One skull -- a blue whale -- measures 12 feet across, eye to eye. Lengthwise, from tip-of-jaw to back-of-skull, we pace it out at 27 boot-lengths. The jawbone is so big around that it comes up past our knees. We look at each other, then glance seaward, knowing that the now-silent bay should be spouting whales. Next to the far north. In the Arctic's Svalbard islands north of Norway, we have come to observe the accelerated melting of glaciers, and we find abandoned whalers' shacks and more whale bones on the beach. These bowheads, killed by the tens of thousands, barely cling to existence in the Atlantic. In 1993, two stone harpoon points were found inside an Alaskan bowhead. It had been harpooned by 19th century hunters still living in the Stone Age. Industrial-age Eskimos finally got it. In chemical analyses of Alaskan bowheads, the oldest whale was deemed 211 years old at its death. It had been gliding through icy seas when Thomas Jefferson was president. What Herman Melville in Moby-Dick called ""so remorseless a havoc"" still resonates in the wide silences of polar seas. Most large whale populations remain depressed. There's no humane way to kill a whale. And at roughly 10 times the price of chicken, no people will starve if they don't eat whale meat. An elderly Inupiat woman once offered me a few pieces of bowhead blubber after inviting me into her home. It really warmed me, and was surprisingly bland-tasting. But the whale needed it more than I did. Australia and New Zealand had argued that Japan was abusing a loophole allowing lethal scientific research within the worldwide commercial whaling ban. (Norway and Iceland ignore the ban). Japan has been killing protected species and hunting in an internationally declared Antarctic whale sanctuary. The international agreement banning commercial whaling allows whale killing ""for the purposes of scientific research."" The court found that Japan was doing ""research,"" but that the whole program was commercial whaling wrapped in a research shroud. In 2012, Japan's Fisheries Agency director explained that minke (rhymes with ""kinky"") whale meat is, ""prized because it is said to have a very good flavor and aroma when eaten as sashimi and the like."" He added that, ""the scientific whaling program ... was necessary to achieve a stable supply of minke whale meat."" In other words, the program is not ""for the purpose"" of scientific research. The court busted Japan on that. As for the quality of the research, the court noted with understatement, ""Japan points to only two peer-reviewed papers... since 2005 and has involved the killing of about 3,600 minke whales, (thus) the scientific output to date appears limited."" At my university, a science professor who published two papers would be terminated by year six. Basically, the court affirmed what was always obvious: Japan's research was bogus. (Part of the research is ""to determine pregnancy rates"" by seeing if they're pregnant at the time of death.) And although it's for commercial purposes, it loses money and is publicly subsidized. Japan compares killing whales with Westerners killing cows. Nice try, but Japan's own laws on killing cows require swift and humane killing. It would be illegal in Japan to kill cows the way they kill whales. Sure, whaling is part of Japanese culture: It's part of New England culture too. Yesterday's culture. There are plenty of old-style harpoons on the walls of Yankee restaurants. That's a good place for them. It's time for Japan to update its strange commitment to cruel and useless whale killing. Much of the world is more interested in whales than ever. We've just gotten beyond killing, into real research, and gained better appreciation and understanding. So I am happy with the ruling that will at least hit the pause button on Japan's incomprehensibly outmoded whale hunts. Japan embraces Western influences ranging from baseball to jazz, business suits, trains, and tobacco. Suzuki makes Samurai cars that harken to an older culture, not samurai swords that cling to it. It's time for Japan to come into the 21st century and hang up the whaling. For good.","World Court ruled Japan's ""scientific"" whale-hunting was baloney and it must stop .

"(CNN) -- This year's critically acclaimed films take audiences from places like slave plantations in the antebellum South, to packed Ebbets Field as Jackie Robinson steps up to bat, and to inner-city public housing on a scorching summer day. While set in various eras and depicting diverse stories, many of the films on the short list for the 2013 awards season show an emerging trend; Hollywood is making movies about the black experience in America. This year alone there have been at least half a dozen movies portraying African-American narratives, including Lee Daniels' ""The Butler,"" ""Fruitvale Station,"" ""The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete,"" ""Blue Caprice,"" ""42"" and ""12 Years a Slave,"" which hits theaters October 18. ""Certainly 2013 has been a banner year with regards to the number of films that feature African-American themes,"" said Gil Robertson, co-founder of the African-American Film Critics Association. ""Those films all really arrive at the threshold in terms of the quality that will seriously put them in the running for Oscar consideration."" Not only do the movies portray the African-American experience, but they're also created from the ground up by today's most prominent black filmmakers and actors. Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker, who played the lead role in ""The Butler,"" says the trend in Hollywood allows for a more diverse storytelling. ""There are so many projects where people are being able to have their voices heard,"" Whitaker said. ""I think that's hopefully going to continue to expand in the African-American community ... and all the voices can be heard in the tapestry of who we are as people."" Hollywood has not seen such an emphasis on African-American storylines since the 1980s and '90s, with Spike Lee and John Singleton's street dramas like ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Boyz n the Hood."" Opinion: Why you should see '12 Years a Slave' ""They were speaking about what was happening in the present day,"" said Ya'Ke Smith, professor of Film at University of Texas at Arlington and independent filmmaker. ""Speaking to a lot of gang violence, debunking stereotypes about young black men in the hood, speaking to racism going on not only in Brooklyn but all over the world."" By the early 2000s, the American blockbuster took a turn with film series like ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings."" But in 2009, Hollywood rekindled a fascination with African-American storylines, with movies like ""The Blind Side,"" ""Invictus"" and ""Precious."" Subsequently, ""The Help"" (2011), ""Red Tails"" (2012) and ""Django Unchained"" (2013) hit mainstream theaters. ""I think the American attitude has changed with regards to going to see films that perhaps feature all African-American casts or that tell African-American stories,"" Robertson said. ""Americans are more open to paying their 10-15 dollars and taking in those experiences."" Some credit the shift in Hollywood to Washington, citing President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration as the spark that reignited interest in the African-American experience, from slavery to the Oval Office. ""People have talked about the 'Obama effect,'"" said Chiwetel Ejiofor, star of ""12 Years a Slave."" ""If people are interested and they want to go and see movies that have diversity or are about different things in that way, then in a way that allows them to be created more."" Ejiofor's ""12 Years a Slave"" co-star Michael Fassbender agrees that the election of the country's first African-American president, along with other timely events, helped trigger universal consciousness. ""We're dealing with 150 years since the abolition of slavery,"" he said. ""There are a lot of anniversaries at the moment, (the assassination of) Martin Luther King Jr. We have a black president in America. All of those things perhaps contribute."" Yet Smith warns that filmmakers must be cautious when focusing on historical narratives, saying too much emphasis on historical events minimizes issues that many African-Americans deal with today. ""When it comes to African-Americans, it's easier to talk about it like it happened, not like it's happening,"" he said. ""That can create a safe dialogue because it happened 50, 100, 150 years ago. It allows us to look at it from a safe distance, but sometimes I think it's irresponsible because these issues are continuing to happen. ""That's why I want to see both sides of the narrative,"" he continued. ""The historical side and the current side. We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go."" Ryan Coogler is one filmmaker who wanted to address the issues that contemporary African-Americans face with his movie ""Fruitvale Station,"" which chronicles the 2009 shooting of black 22-year-old Oscar Grant by a BART police officer. ""That's something that I deal with on a day-to-day basis, losing friends to gun violence,"" the 26-year-old director said at the movie's premiere. ""I've seen lives cut short too soon, whether it be police-involved shootings or whether it be black-on-black crime. ""What gets glossed over is that we're human beings, too, like everybody else, young African-American males. I hope the people can see a little bit of themselves in the character if they sit down and watch the film."" Similarly, ""The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete"" illuminates the struggles of people living in the inner-city projects, following 13-year-old Mister (Skylan Brooks) as he tries to survive through a stifling New York summer after being abandoned by his mother (Jennifer Hudson). ""Mister's journey is not often heard,"" actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje said at the movie's premiere. ""What he does is he just shows the humanity of who he is as a young black child, and you're able to see his humanity, his heart, beyond his skin color."" Opinion: Why 'The Butler' is groundbreaking . More than simply stories on the streets, this year's batch of movies also represent African-American family life on the big screen. Oprah Winfrey revealed she was very drawn to the cast of ""The Butler"" because of the central portrayal of the African-American familyâ€”doing typical things, like dropping a son off to college and finishing one another's sentences. ""One of the reasons why I love this film and wanted to be a part of it is the tenderness between the husband and wife, the tenderness and nurturing nature of the middle-class family,"" Winfrey said. When it comes to depicting black family life, Robertson said the film industry has been slow to catch up to television, referencing sitcoms like ""The Cosby Show"" in the 1980s. And some argue that Hollywood still needs to stop putting African-Americans in roles of servitude, like slaves and servants, and start casting them more often as regular characters in mainstream movies. ""Critics don't look at a film and notice that every one of the lead roles is white,"" said Ronda Racha Penrice, author of ""African-American History For Dummies"" and editor at ""Uptown"" magazine. ""We're taught it's the norm, and it's not the norm. We believe that we can have really good films that have majority white casts; why can't we believe that we can have a majority black, Latino, or Asian cast, and have a good film as well?"" However, some point out that the idea of a black renaissance in the film industry can be simplistic, and argue that in Hollywood the most important color isn't black or white, but green. Filmmaking is a business, and ultimately diverse story lines in mainstream theaters depend on funding and subsequent success at the box office. ""I don't think it's because there's any age of enlightenment,"" said Alfre Woodard, who is in ""12 Years a Slave."" ""I think it's just serendipitous for those individuals that fight to get funding for the stories they want to get told; it just sort of happened that way right now. It will go just as dry as it ever was shortly."" Nonetheless, the resurgence in movies that focus on African-American stories is apparent, with more than a dozen such films opening in the past four years. Even more, like ""Belle"" and ""Get On Up,"" are set for release in 2014. ""The commercial and critical success of these films is showing,"" Penrice said. ""Just like there are audiences for the various 'Avengers' movies, there are people who want to see these slices of wider America."" The push for more diversity is coming from within Hollywood as well. Lupita Nyong'o, another actor in ""12 Years a Slave,"" said she looks forward to the day when films that feature African-American stories will no longer be an anomaly. Meanwhile, ""The Butler"" director Lee Daniels is reportedly planning production for an action movie starring an interracial gay couple. ""They have to fund those movies"" said Octavia Spencer, one of the stars of ""Fruitvale Station."" ""You have to create a level playing field for women, for people of color, gay, straight, whatever. We just need to do it. The money's there. The subject's there."" 'The Butler' reflects America's racial conversations .","In 2013, half a dozen movies portraying the African-American experience have been released .
The trend may signify a renaissance of African-American film .
But some actors look forward to the day when the trend is not an anomaly ."
"(CNN) -- The powerful 8.2-magnitude earthquake that struck northern Chile on Tuesday night came after a series of quakes had shaken the Los Angeles area in recent weeks. Could there be a link between these recent seismic events? Do they portend a larger and perhaps more dire planetary crisis? A sign that a tectonic doomsday may soon be upon us? ""No,"" said Dr. Gavin Hayes, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. ""Totally unrelated,"" agreed Cal Tech geophysicist Mark Simons. ""The most important thing everyone needs to remember is these are two of some of the most seismologically active places in the world,"" CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. So you can rest a little easier, Californians. Your state and Chile lie on different faults that ""are too far apart"" for the earthquakes to be linked, according to Hayes. Chile's latest quake occurred between the Nazca and South America plates along the Peru-Chile Trench, a region that ""has produced some of the largest earthquakes in the world,"" according to the USGS website. The Los Angeles-area quakes occurred within the Puente Hills thrust zone, which while not as large or as well-known as California's infamous San Andreas fault, is potentially as destructive because of its precarious location under downtown Los Angeles, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. As for why the quakes all occurred around the same time period: ""It's just a natural cycle of seismicity,"" Hayes said. But even though the earthquakes are not linked, anyone living in ""seismologically active places"" should nevertheless always be prepared. ""Angelinos should use what's been going on in the last few weeks as a reminder to get their stuff in order so they are not surprised,"" Simons said. Chile quake was big, but a bigger one awaits .","Southern California was rattled by temblors for weeks before big quake in Chile .
The two sites lie on different faults, so the seismic activity is not related, scientists say .

"(CNN) -- This is what happens when politics starts looking like a cult: Jeb Bush gets attacked for being a traitor to the conservative cause. The former Florida governor has been speaking with the freedom of someone not running for office, saying that both his father and Ronald Reagan would have had a hard time in today's hard-right GOP and questioning the wisdom of Grover Norquist's absolutist anti-tax pledge. That set off a fascinating public fight between Bush and Norquist, two faces of competing factions within Republican Party. It is the latest evidence of a growing GOP backlash against the ideological straitjacket Norquist has attempted to impose on governing in the United States. On one side is a vision of the Republican Party that is committed to reaching out beyond its base with a focus on governing responsibly in the national interest. On the other side is a Republican Party driven by ideological activists and special interests, elevating pledges over principled but pragmatic solutions. The Norquist pledge commits signers to oppose all tax increases on individuals or businesses in any circumstances as well as changing deductions or credits unless they are revenue neutral. This skirmish started when Bush was asked about the pledge: ""I ran for office three times,"" he explained. ""The pledge was presented to me three times. I never signed the pledge. I cut taxes every year I was governor. I don't believe you outsource your principles and convictions to people."" The common-sense statement was regarded as a shot across the bow to Norquist, who quickly went on CNN's ""The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer"" to push back, saying that Bush had ""stepped in it"" and ""really misspoke and insulted Romney"" because Mitt Romney had fallen in line and obediently signed the pledge. Escalation occurred this week when Bush said, ""Ronald Reagan would have, based on his record of finding accommodation, finding some degree of common ground, as would my dad -- they would have a hard time if you define the Republican Party -- and I don't -- as having an orthodoxy that doesn't allow for disagreement, doesn't allow for finding some common ground."" He added, ""Back to my dad's time and Ronald Reagan's time -- they got a lot of stuff done with a lot of bipartisan support,"" saying that Reagan ""would be criticized for doing the things that he did."" This statement has the advantage of being both opinion and fact. Reagan achieved his administration's agenda through cooperation with liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill, the House speaker. There were deep philosophical differences between the two but also a capacity to work together. Both Reagan and Bush -- and for that matter even Barry Goldwater -- would be accused of violating a number of litmus tests currently considered deal-breakers by conservatives.  But let's look closer at one in particular: taxes. Of course, Reagan championed lower tax rates, but he also signed off on a number of smaller tax hikes to help address revenue shortfalls and most importantly backed a bipartisan 1986 bill that closed loopholes as part of a simplification plan that raised revenues to help deal with the deficit. This inconvenient fact is often denied by Norquist and other activists because it is their prime objection to attempts to find a ""grand bargain"" on deficits and debt, along the lines of the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission. In pursuit of a reality check, take a look at this quote: ""We're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share. In theory, some of those loopholes were understandable, but in practice they sometimes made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver was paying 10% of his salary, and that's crazy. It's time we stopped it."" That might sound straight out of President Barack Obama ""Buffett Tax"" playbook -- which conservatives routinely attack as ""class warfare"" -- but in fact it is the sainted Reagan speaking in 1985. Add to that the fact that the first President Bush backed a bipartisan deficit reduction plan that included a 2-to-1 spending cut to tax revenue formula and you have the kind of data that drives Norquist nuts. Here was his response to Jeb Bush on this front: ""There's a guy who watched his father throw away his presidency on a 2:1 (ratio of spending cuts to tax increases) promise. ... And he thinks he's sophisticated by saying that he'd take a 10:1 promise. He doesn't understand -- he's just agreed to walk down the same alley his dad did with the same gang. And he thinks he's smart. You walk down that alley, you don't come out."" The angry defensiveness of the statement, the thinly veiled threats and thuggish imagery, has all the signs of someone who worries that he might be losing a rational argument. As it turns out, Norquist has reason to be concerned. It's not just Jeb Bush. A growing number of Republicans are rejecting his pledge. Oklahoma conservative Sen. Tom Coburn called the pledge's effective veto of deficit reduction plans ""ridiculous"" when talking with Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on Tuesday declared his independence from the pledge, saying, ""We're so far in debt, that if you don't give up some ideological ground, the country sinks."" Add to those voices seven other Republican U.S. senators -- from Maine's Susan Collins to Iowa's Chuck Grassley to Wyoming's John Barrasso -- and 11 Republican House members, ranging from centrist New Yorker Richard Hanna to tea party Floridian Allen West. The bottom line is that a growing number of Republicans are deciding to throw off the ideological straitjacket to get serious about actually reducing the deficit and the debt. It is a courageous move at a time when cultlike group-think dictates that the pledge must be signed or your political career is dead in the water. The choice between Bush's and Norquist's vision of the Republican Party is ultimately no contest at all. It's the difference between responsible governance and agitated activism, a growing party or a shrinking one. And of course in the end the only pledge that really matters is the Pledge of Allegiance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","It's a bad sign for GOP when Jeb Bush's conservative allegiance questioned, John Avlon says .
Avlon says Bush was right to repudiate Grover Norquist's anti-tax pledge .
Ronald Reagan was willing to accept some tax increases to achieve compromise, he says .
Avlon: In the battle between Bush and Norquist, the smart choice is to back Bush's view ."
"(CNN) -- The Coast Guard and BP declared the Deepwater Horizon cleanup over in three states Monday but will keep watching dozens of miles of Louisiana shoreline where oil still washes ashore. More than three years after the worst oil spill in U.S. history erupted in the Gulf of Mexico, the coastlines of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida have been returned to ""as close to pre-spill conditions as possible,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Natalie Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. In Louisiana, however, 84 miles of coastline -- mostly barrier islands like Grand Isle and Elmer's Island, about 90 miles south of New Orleans -- is still subject to cleanup, Murphy said. Those areas are still seeing tar balls and occasional mats of weather oil wash up on the beach regularly, particularly since Hurricane Isaac stirred up fresh oil from the seabed in late 2012. Murphy said the decision was made when only small amounts of oil were being found by cleanup crews. Those crews had ""a very large footprint going on some very sensitive areas,"" she said. ""It begs the question of how much harm are we doing to the environment by walking in or driving ATVs just for a small amount of oil,"" she said. Now, she said, the Coast Guard will check out any reports of oil on the beaches, and BP will continue to be required to clean up any oil that traces back to the Deepwater Horizon spill. But environmental groups quickly expressed concern that Monday's decision was premature. ""We don't want the nation to think this disaster is over when oil washes ashore somewhere along Alabama's 53 miles of beach every day,"" Casi Callaway, executive director of Mobile Baykeeper, told CNN. Callaway said residents and tourists will now have to become ""oil spotters"" on the beaches. And the National Wildlife Federation said as many as 1 million barrels of oil from the disaster remained unaccounted for. ""Regardless of how our shorelines are monitored, BP must be held accountable for the cleanup,"" David White, the head of the group's Gulf of Mexico Restoration Campaign, said in a statement on the decision. ""We cannot just accept oiled material on our beaches and in our marshes as the 'new normal.' "" The drill rig Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in April 2010, killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher from a BP-owned well called Macondo a mile underwater. It took three months to cap the well, and federal officials estimate nearly 5 million barrels of oil -- more than 200 million gallons -- poured into the Gulf in that time. Most of the oil is believed to have been eaten by hydrocarbon-munching microbes in the Gulf. But an undetermined portion settled to the floor of the Gulf, and tar balls and tar mats are still turning up across the region. Crews dug up a 450-pound tar mat left behind by the spill in Pensacola Beach, Florida, in early April, Murphy said. Murphy said the decision announced Monday ""is a transition, not an end."" ""We're going to maintain the proper staffing in order to address those episodic re-oiling instances, and it will be cleaned up,"" she said. Meanwhile, BP spokesman Jason Ryan said the company is making ""significant progress"" in the remaining cleanup work in Louisiana. Ryan said the company still has about 85 workers from a contractor committed to the cleanup work there. In January, he said, crews drilled 14,000 holes in search of buried oil. Only 3% of those holes found enough oil to require cleanup, and that process is ""nearly complete,"" he said. Work is also going on in the marshes of Barataria Bay, home to some of the worst-hit spots. ""At Upper Barataria Bay, we finally received permission to treat areas that had been set aside for treatment studies just a few months ago and are now progressing them through the final inspection process,"" Ryan told CNN. And he said that the company will clean up any new oil that traces back to the blowout. ""If people do receive these reports, the Coast Guard will come and investigate, and if it's found to be from Macondo, BP will respond,"" he said. The disaster has cost BP an estimated $32 billion to date, including $14 billion in cleanup costs. It's also paid out nearly $8 billion in compensation to Gulf Coast residents, pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges and paid a $4 billion fine for the deaths on the rig. CNN's John Murgatroyd and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","Oil spill cleanup called complete in Alabama, Mississippi and Florida .

"(CNN) -- In the eyes of the public, the year is ending for Lindsay Lohan in much the same way it began: with an impending court date. At the start of January 2012, the then 25-year-old actress was on track to receive a positive midmonth progress report on her efforts to complete probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007. Yet as we begin a new year, Lohan is scheduled to go before a judge once again on January 15, this time for a probation violation hearing after her probation stemming from a 2011 shoplifting case was revoked. It's a cycle that has become all too familiar to even the most casual observers, thanks to the coverage that's tracked her every car accident, substance abuse struggle and financial problem for not just the past 12 months, but the past five years. Her life and her decisions have become so singularly infamous that even her appearances on ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Glee"" earlier this year, pegged as attempts to get her career back on track, poked fun at her turbulent history. And we've joined in: If there's news of another Lohan arrest, Twitter is filled with jokes. When the website BuzzFeed puts together a list of those who are having a worse day than the average reader, Lohan's on there. The pile-up of overwhelmingly negative reactions to her role as Elizabeth Taylor in Lifetime's ""Liz & Dick"" bordered on comical. But the cynical humor isn't wholly unexpected: Since 2007 we've had front-row seats to 19 court appearances, five rehab stints, one no contest plea to a necklace theft charge and an alleged altercation at a nightclub. By now, Lindsay Lohan has become less of a living, breathing human being than a public punchline. Yet this year, it seems that ""joke"" has become as worn out as the saga itself. ""There always comes a point where you are just done. I think that's really happened to a lot of people with Lindsay because she hasn't exhibited any long-term ability to break the pattern of misbehavior, and it's really disappointing to a lot of people. She's been given a second, third, fourth chance, and the narrative is very tired,"" said E!'s Chief News Correspondent Ken Baker, who referred to the attitude as ""Lindsay fatigue."" In general, public interest has shown signs of that, said celebrity journalist David Caplan of GossipDavid.com. The response to stories about her, he said, isn't as robust as it was when she was a teen star in her ""Mean Girls"" era circa 2004. The reason the coverage doesn't go away, much to the annoyance of the frustrated ""Why is this news?!"" readers, is more complicated. For starters, there's no ignoring the fact that Lohan is still a celebrity in the truest sense of the word, with her currency having less to do with her career than it does with her power of recognition. ""America completely fell in love with her when she looked like this girl next door, and she was cute and had a real talent, "" said Us Weekly reporter Jennifer Peros. Although she has been seen more often in court than on screen in recent years, Lohan is still ""a huge name."" With the November TV movie ""Liz & Dick,"" ""people were definitely expecting it to bomb, but at the same time, everybody tuned in just to see what she'd be like. People all over the country were watching that movie on Sunday night. ... If people totally wrote her off, nobody would really care about what she's doing,"" Peros said. ""Anything she does is going to make headlines, and it's sad. ... I flew out to L.A. to interview her for that big story we did, and just sitting out with her in a public place, people pass by her and take pictures of her for no reason, just because it's Lindsay Lohan."" At this point, said Caplan, the press isn't going to turn away from a star, particularly one who keeps landing in trouble. ""Lindsay Lohan stories always have the perfect narrative -- there's drama, there's conflict,"" said Caplan. ""That's why she gets covered, because she lands in these problems that make the perfect stories."" As a result, she has turned into something of an ""easy target."" ""There always has to be some, and it's cyclical,"" said Caplan. ""There was a time when Mischa Barton was targeted; earlier this year, it was Amanda Bynes. There's always a few people, and Lindsay Lohan's good because she always ends up in these situations."" But these days, Baker said, her pattern of behavior has turned into a kind of reality show the public doesn't want to watch. ""I can't tell you how many people have said to me over the past few months, 'I really wish she would just go away and get help.' Whatever it is. We don't know what her problems are. Those are very personal issues she's dealing with,"" he said. ""And whatever that is, even on just a human level, whether you're a fan or a journalist or you're just an impartial observer, you have to want someone to get healthy and take care of themselves."" The encouraging news out of this, added Peros, is that Hollywood is home to plenty of comebacks. ""If a celebrity wants to change the narrative, they can do that by actually changing the behavior,"" he said. Since charges were filed against her in November in connection with a car accident that happened last summer, ""we haven't seen anything of Lindsay Lohan, nothing out of control,"" Baker said. ""And that says to me that she is capable of controlling her behavior.""","To the public, Lindsay Lohan is ending her year much in the same way it began .
The star's personal and professional difficulties have become an all too familiar cycle .
The coverage has become so commonplace, she's turned into an easy target .
Yet this year, the joke seems to have become as tired as the saga itself ."
"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A prominent Thai political activist was shot and wounded Wednesday, the day after the national government declared a state of emergency amid violence-plagued protests in Bangkok, a police official said. Unidentified people in a pickup truck opened fire on Kwanchai Praipana, a local leader of the pro-government ""red shirt"" movement, outside his home in Udon Thani province in northeastern Thailand, said police official Col. Kovit Charionwattanasak. His wounds aren't life-threatening, Kovit said. Police suspect the shooting may be politically motivated, he said, but they haven't ruled out a connection to Kwanchai's ""personal conflicts."" The attack is likely to fan tensions in Thailand's political crisis. In Bangkok, demonstrations against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra have been hit by attacks with explosives in the past week that have killed one person and wounded dozens. The violence, whose perpetrators haven't been identified, prompted authorities to impose the state of emergency, which went into effect Wednesday and lasts 60 days. The emergency decree gives authorities the power to impose curfews, detain suspects without court permission, censor media and declare parts of the capital off-limits. Political divide . The red shirts -- who draw their support from the populous, less affluent northeast of Thailand -- support Yingluck's government. On the other side of the country's political divide are the anti-government protesters, who are loosely allied with the opposition Democrat Party. Since the protesters began their campaign against Yingluck's government in November, at least nine people have died and hundreds have been wounded, according to authorities. In a bid to resolve the crisis, Yingluck dissolved parliament last month and called for new elections to be held February 2. But the move has done little to appease protesters. They have called on Yingluck to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected ""people's council,"" which would see through electoral and political changes. They want the elections postponed, and the Democrat Party has said it will boycott the vote. Protesters remain on streets . Thailand's national security chief, Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathubut said the emergency decree had been considered because ""we are predicting that (the) situation might get more violent"" as the vote nears. ""We are witnessing more gun shootings and bomb incidents on the streets of Bangkok,"" he said. Thousands of protesters have remained on the streets ahead of the elections. The latest round of demonstrations, which began last week, was aimed at shutting down Bangkok. They have succeeded in disrupting traffic at major intersections in the city, but their numbers have fallen significantly since the initial rallies. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. They say Yingluck is merely a puppet of Thaksin, a divisive figure who built his support on populist policies that pleased residents of the north and northeast. Yingluck has repeatedly denied her brother calls the shots in the government. The protest movement in Bangkok began as an angry response to a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for Thaksin's return. Thailand's worst bout of civil unrest took place in 2010, when the government -- run at the time by the Democrat Party -- ordered a crackdown on red shirt protesters, leaving about 90 people dead. CNN's Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","NEW: A leading red shirt in northeast Thailand is shot and wounded outside his home .

"(CNN) -- Michael Bloomberg signed a bill Monday to regulate the use of electronic cigarettes -- one of 22 bills he signed at City Hall that are the last he will sign as mayor of New York City, according to Evelyn Erskine, his deputy press secretary. The legislation amends the Smoke-Free Air Act, which bans smoking in public places such as restaurants, bars, parks, beaches and places of employment. It now additionally prohibits the use of electronic cigarettes in all areas where smoking is prohibited. E-cigarettes will still be permitted in areas where smoking is allowed, in addition to retail e-cigarette stores and vapor lounges. E-cigarettes are ""battery-operated products that turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and/or chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user,"" according to Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Jennifer Haliski. Unlike a regular cigarette, there's no tobacco burned and when users inhale, instead of smoke, there's a steam-like vapor. Some e-cigarette devices claim to help people kick their smoking habit, but Bloomberg said he's not convinced and it's just another way to inhale nicotine. ""It works about as well as patches, which is to say it really doesn't work,"" he said. A pro-smoking activist read a brief statement lobbying against the bill, saying smoking is within a person's legal private life and not public health. ""You don't own me like state property,"" the lobbyist said to Bloomberg as she took out a cigarette from her pocket and lit up. The woman was escorted out of the meeting immediately afterward. Aaron David Ross told CNN's Poppy Harlow he smoked cigarettes for 10 years. While he's still addicted to nicotine, he hasn't smoked a cigarette for two and a half years. He credits kicking the bad habit to e-cigarettes. Ross said he worries many Americans are so opposed to smoking that they're stigmatizing something some say could save lives. Thomas Glynn, director of Cancer Science and Trends at the American Cancer Society, said that e-cigarette users should smoke with ""cautious optimism."" ""Anyone who uses an e-cigarette right now does not know what they're inhaling,"" Glynn said. ""What we don't want to do is to take something out of the hands of people which could in fact help people stop using the traditional burn cigarette, which is the enemy."" There are no e-cigarette devices regulated by any federal body, and e-cigarettes are not an FDA-approved method to quit smoking. A 2010 court decision, which the FDA agreed to abide by, held that if e-cigarette companies stopped making therapeutic claims, their products would not be regulated by the FDA, according to Haliski. Right now, the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products -- established in 2009 by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act -- has the authority to only regulate certain categories of ""tobacco products,"" which exclusively applies to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco, according to Haliski. The FDA intends to propose a rule deeming any product that meets the definition of a ""tobacco product"" under the act to be subject to FDA's regulatory authority. The FDA also intends to propose a regulation that would extend the agency's ""tobacco product"" authorities to other categories of tobacco products that meet the statutory definition of ""tobacco product,"" Haliski told CNN. ""Further research is needed to assess the potential public health benefits and risk of electronic cigarettes and other novel tobacco products,"" Haliski said. The FDA declined to comment on the newly signed bill in New York. Bloomberg signed another controversial bill at the final meeting of the legislative session, which requires the Department of Sanitation commissioner to determine the recyclability of expanded polystyrene foam, leading to the potential ban of the material from food services establishments, mobile food commissaries and retail stores beginning July 1, 2015. ""All of the environmental stuff, the payoff isn't for years, but it's what makes the city habitable and keeps us safe,"" Bloomberg said.

"(CNN) -- As a college professor who has talked to hundreds of women who are aiming to break the glass ceiling, I find that all the hubbub about paving the road to success by enlisting mentors, joining a support group, and simply learning to take it like a man misses a crucial point: Young women are ambitious but worried about making it all happen. Like clockwork, my female college students -- future doctors, lawyers, bankers, and computer programmers -- show up for office hours when course materials confront them with the realities of gender and family issues in the 21st century. The key questions on these minds of these twenty-something-year-olds are: Will they ever be able to have kids if they pursue a career in medicine, law, banking, or high-tech? Should their Plan B exclude kids altogether? Is there any hope that will not repeat the mistakes of mothers who opted out and found out they couldn't opt back in when their children were grown? Is it really going to be that difficult? Even though these women are, statistically, years away from marriage and bearing children, and they have come to take careers and economic independence for granted, they know that work/family balance is a thorny subject. And they are worried about how -- and if -- they can have it all. Opinion: Don't ask for all, ask what makes you happy . So I do a little therapy with them. We start with the obvious: Find a spouse who will split up the housework; (the research is on their side; American men are pulling much more weight at home than ever before). We talk about delaying childbearing. We talk about finding the ""right fit."" But there's no way to work around the elephant in the room: a supportive spouse, the right career choice, and delaying childbearing into their 30s won't help them figure out how to remain on the fast track when they're aching not to miss their babies' first steps or first day in kindergarten. 10 views: Our struggle to 'have it all' ""I don't necessarily need to be there with cookie and milk everyday when my kids come home from school but I want to be a part of my kids' lives. How can you do that if you're working 12 hours a day?"" said one future doctor. She's considering forgoing children altogether. And she's not alone. American women are having fewer children and at later ages. A staggering number of them are deciding to not to have children. Some pundits are worried, while others celebrate the diversity of choices. Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist at New York University interviewed young men and women about their perceptions of work-family issues before the real juggle began. She learned that both men and women were planning on equally sharing their work and home requirements. However, there was a persistent gender gap between these young, still childless men and women. Their ""Plan Bs"" varied widely: Young men thought that if the equality ideal failed, their wives would be the ones to cut back on work. Young women agreed. Which brings us back to glass ceilings and shattered dreams. Work, family and 'leaning in': Seven families trying to make it work . One particularly bright student, nearing graduation, reflected on how she has always felt equal to her male peers; in fact, she out-performed them. ""I was the total driven alpha male,"" she said. She was thrilled to land a lucrative internship at a bio-tech research lab after her junior year. ""And that's when it hit me,"" she said, of her choice, to rethink her career plans; ""I realized that I was never going to see daylight! I mean, I was working with these brilliant people. These brilliant women. But there was this young mother who always trying to get out early enough to spend time with her son; and of course it almost never worked out. I mean the kid was fine, the dad picked him up from preschool. But watching her struggle really made me think. I always thought that I was just going to make it work. But now I'm not so sure anymore."" She's still heading out to a prestigious Ph.D. program in the fall, but is now thinking of a less demanding career path. For a new generation of women, they are making rational choices. They understand that their ability to balance their lives has much more to do with what the American workplace of the future will look like than any of the choices they will make. The question remains: Will the workplace of the future evolve for the better so that women won't have to worry anymore? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Orit Avishai.","Orit Avishai: My young college female students are ambitious and smart .
Avishai: But they worry about balancing family and career and whether to have children .

"Eureka, California (CNN) -- Police had a man who is suspected of killing a Catholic priest in his California rectory, but they let him go. It was mere hours before the slaying of the Rev. Eric Freed that an odd-acting Gary Lee Bullock had been in custody for public intoxication. On New Year's Eve, Humboldt County sheriff's deputies had responded to reports that a person was ""acting strangely"" and arrested Bullock, taking him to jail. But Bullock, police said, was ""rejected"" from the facility ""due to his erratic behavior."" Bullock, 43, was then moved to a nearby hospital, ""where he became more agitated and had to be physically restrained by deputies,"" police said. Bullock was eventually booked into a jail shortly after 4:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve, staying there for more than eight hours. He was released at 12:43 a.m. on January 1. Less than two hours later, police got a call about a suspicious person at St. Bernard Church in Eureka, California. Officers found Bullock there, but he was not taken into custody. He wasn't ""intoxicated and did not qualify for an emergency psychological hold,"" explained Eureka Police Chief Andy Mills. Instead, police referred Bullock to a shelter, Mills said. At some point later, a guard at St. Bernard found a person matching Bullock's description on the premises and told him to leave, police said. Then there was a devastating discovery. Church staff found Freed's body, and police were called at 9 a.m. on New Year's Day. Officers and a parishioner, who happened to be a doctor, determined the priest was dead. Mills said there were signs of ""forced entry"" and a struggle. Police said the reverend suffered ""blunt force trauma."" An arrest warrant was issued for Bullock, and authorities asked for the public's help in finding him and a 2010 Nissan hybrid belonging to the slain priest. Bullock apparently fled 45 minutes from the parish to a family member's house in Freed's car, police told CNN. One of Bullock's relatives called police. ""There's no question in our mind he's responsible for this heinous act,"" Chief Mills told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday, citing evidence recovered at the crime scene and interviews with eyewitnesses allegedly linking Bullock to the priest's death. The county coroner on Thursday ruled the death a homicide. An autopsy is set for Saturday. Mills said Thursday that authorities don't have a motive for the killing. But the police chief speculated it was probably ""a crime of opportunity."" ""To me, 'why' is the biggest thing that we would like to establish -- to bring a sense of ease and comfort to the community,"" Mills said. ""But right now, I'm just glad that this incident is done, it is over with, he's in custody (and) the public can take a deep breath."" Killing shakes town, friends, parishioners . Freed's slaying has rattled many in Eureka, including members of Freed's parish and those who knew him from the nearby public university where he taught. Mourning parishioners and community leaders gathered outside the church Thursday. John Chiv said that he and other St. Bernard parishioners are shocked and angry. ""It's hard to feel Christian because ... it was brutal,"" Chiv said, adding that Freed was ""very jovial ... very accessible (and) very loving."" ""We lost a pastor, we lost a friend and, for many of us, he was like a father figure."" Freed had been part of the greater Santa Rosa diocese since 1999, establishing himself as a ""great preacher"" and an engaging teacher from his work in Catholic schools, said Msgr. Daniel Whelton. ""He was like an old shoe, just an easy person to be with,"" said the monsignor, who is the diocese's vicar general. ""... He was an upbeat person (who) always saw the glass half full. ... It wasn't about him."" The death of the priest was felt beyond the church. Eureka Mayor Frank Jager said Freed was a personal friend and had been a ""tremendous person in this community"" since his arrival three years ago. While he was relatively new to St. Bernard, Freed had already made an impact there and elsewhere around Eureka -- including with the city's Japanese-American community. Freed lived in Japan for many years, Jager told reporters. ""This is an absolutely tremendous loss not only for the St. Bernard's Parish, but for our community generally,"" the mayor said. ""For those of us who believe in prayer, this is the time for that."" ""Eric knew as well as anybody just how senseless violence could be,"" said William Herbrechtsmeier, a professor at Humboldt State University, where Freed was a lecturer. ""When a fine person like him is brought down -- that's just tragic."" Herbrechtsmeier said the priest's life extended beyond his work. He was a diehard University of Southern California Trojans fan and loved to watch sports. He wrote a book about the first atomic bomb and also taught about the New Testament. ""He was a really, genuinely warm individual,"" said professor Stephen Cunha, the chairman of Humboldt State University's religious studies department. ""Kind is the word that comes to mind, sensitive."" ""He was very well respected, very well liked and had a tremendous working knowledge as well as academic knowledge,"" Cunha said. ""To think that he passed in this way, it's just layers of grief and shock."" ""This was not some stuffy clergyman. He was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with. ... He connected with everybody."" Just a few days ago, the priest sent a note to his parishioners, thanking them for their support and prayers and wishing them a merry Christmas and happy New Year. ""I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to be your pastor,"" Freed wrote in a letter posted on the parish website. ""Our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as Catholic Christians."" CNN's Ashley Fantz and Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta, and CNN's Dan Simon reported from Eureka. CNN's Augie Martin, Devon Sayers and Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","The slain priest was a friend and father figure to many, a parishioner says .

"Steubenville, Ohio (CNN) -- The attorney for one of two teenagers charged with rape in a case that has consumed a small Ohio town wants a judge to postpone and move his client's trial, he said Sunday. Adam Nemann, the lawyer for 16-year-old defendant Trent Mays, told CNN he wants the case moved out of Steubenville because of the extensive publicity it has received ""and what we perceive as threats to individuals, perhaps witnesses, and also defendants and even defense counsel."" Nemann would not elaborate on those threats but said media attention and an explosion of online postings about the case are another part of the reason he'll be filing motions for a postponement and a change of venue. ""We're concerned about safety issues at this point,"" he added. Mays and co-defendant Ma'lik Richmond, also 16, are charged with raping a teenage girl during late-night partying and drinking in August. Both teens are scheduled to be tried February 13 in a juvenile court in Steubenville, in eastern Ohio near the West Virginia state line. Richmond's lawyer, Walter Madison, told CNN he also plans to file a motion for change of venue ""and another motion that will probably necessitate a hearing."" He declined to elaborate. A judge from Cincinnati is hearing the case after a local judge recused himself to avoid an appearance of conflict, and the local district attorney asked Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's office to handle the prosecution. DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney did not directly address Nemann's concerns Sunday. ""The investigation is ongoing, and it includes all aspects of the case, including evidence put out in social media,"" Tierney said. ""So the investigation is still ongoing at this time. We'll review any motions they file."" Trials are often granted a change of venue because of the fear of a tainted jury pool. But in this case, a judge will determine the teens' fate. Police Chief William McCafferty said many people in town know someone who may have a connection to the case. CNN is not identifying the girl, a juvenile, in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims. Although the suspects also are juveniles, CNN is identifying them because they have been publicly named by a juvenile court judge, by defense attorneys and in media accounts. Special prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter told a judge at a probable cause hearing last October that the girl ""was unresponsive, not in a position of consent, and they knew about it, and let's be clear, they knew she was drunk."" Lawyers for both defendants have said their clients are not guilty. ""We deny the accusations completely. We deny the lack of consent. We deny that there was sexual activity. We deny that there was a rape. And we steadfastly maintain that,"" Nemann said. Madison said his client has denied the charge in court. The attorney has complained that Richmond's presumption of innocence has been destroyed by the publicity surrounding the case. ""Our emotional response is he's a juvenile, and it's life-altering -- and that was before it became the focus of international media attention,"" Madison said, adding, ""All I want is justice."" The case gained national attention after The New York Times published a lengthy piece on it in December and when the activist hacker group Anonymous posted a previously unpublicized video of teenagers cracking jokes about the case. Nemann said his motions will be filed under seal, but he plans to tell the judge that his case may be hamstrung by hesitant witnesses. Some potential witnesses who attended the parties where the alleged sexual assaults occurred are refusing to talk with his defense team, the lawyer said. ""I'm concerned about whether or not the case should be tried in this area,"" Nemann said. ""Perhaps the fact that it is in the Steubenville area is going to prohibit certain people from wanting to come forward and testify.""","Lawyer for one suspect is concerned about safety for his client .

"(CNN) -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the Daytona 500 on Sunday night in a race delayed six hours because of weather. He crossed the finish line about 11:30 p.m., giving him his first Daytona win since 2004. The track has special meaning for Earnhardt because his father, the legendary Dale Earnhardt, was killed in a wreck during the 2001 race. The race was stopped around 2 p.m. when rain forced drivers to pit road. The 150,000 fans were told to evacuate the grandstands and take necessary precautions after weather radar indicated conditions were favorable for an imminent tornado. The rains came and went, crews worked to dry the track, and full-speed racing resumed just before 9 p.m. During the delay, fans tuning in on Fox Sports were shown a replay of last year's race, causing some confusion. Jimmie Johnson won in 2013, edging out Earnhardt and a host of others down the stretch. ""I hear I won the #Daytona500? Haha! I also have friends confused and texting congratulations to me,"" he posted on his Twitter account. Bleacher Report: Confusion rains down on Twitter, Fox News . Fox News also apologized Sunday for erroneously reporting on its Facebook page that Johnson had won this year's race. ""We sincerely apologize to our viewers and readers for this inaccurate report,"" the network said. After the midafternoon storm, the National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida, later canceled the tornado warning for parts of Volusia County, including the area around the Daytona International Speedway. ""The safety of our race fans is always a primary concern. We have a detailed plan in place to monitor weather and if necessary, communicate to our fans,"" said Lenny Santiago, spokesman at Daytona International Speedway. Earnhardt won his first race in 55 tries going back to 2012. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: Fox News apologizes for erroneously reporting this year's winner .

"Cairo (CNN) -- An Egyptian police brigadier general was killed and five others were injured in bombings Wednesday outside Cairo University, the Interior Ministry said. Three blasts rocked the area outside the university campus -- the first two in quick succession near the faculty of engineering and a third a little later near the main gate. Hundreds of police and security officials cordoned off the area, where forensic experts and sniffer dogs were brought in to investigate. Ambulances also arrived on the scene. Attacks targeting security forces have become increasingly common in Egypt since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsy, who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood, in July following mass protests against his rule. In a statement, the Interior Ministry said Brig. Gen. Tariq al-Mirgawi, police chief of the criminal unit in West Giza, was killed in the blasts. Those injured were police officers. ""Experts determined that the two explosive devices were planted in one of the trees in the area,"" the ministry said, adding that an investigation was under way. A security source within the ministry told CNN the bombs appeared to be ""homemade."" Internal strife . Al-Mirgawi's funeral, held at the police academy in Cairo, was broadcast live on state-run Nile TV. The station had earlier reported security forces were dealing with a car loaded with TNT explosive material which was discovered outside the campus. State TV later said al Nahda square, which is in front of the campus, had been opened to traffic following police searches. The blasts caused part of a building to collapse, the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported. Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab called an emergency meeting of the Cabinet's security committee. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but Islamist militants have carried out similar operations in a fast-growing insurgency threatening Egypt, which will hold presidential elections on May 26-27. Egypt has faced unending turmoil since the uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Since Morsy's ouster, the country has suffered the worst internal strife in its modern history. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up soon after his removal from office. Battleground . In recent weeks, the area around the university has become a battleground for clashes between police and Muslim Brotherhood supporters. Cairo's military-installed government has declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group. It accuses the movement of supporting attacks against the police and army -- an allegation the Brotherhood denies. Since Morsy's ouster, more than 1,000 people have been killed and thousands of Brotherhood members have been detained in a crackdown by the interim authorities. The government says militants have killed almost 500 people in the same time period, most of them police and soldiers. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who toppled Morsy, is expected to win the May presidential vote easily. He is popular among Egyptians who supported the army's decision to remove Morsy from power a year into his term and see el-Sisi as the kind of strongman needed to end the turmoil dogging the Arab world's most populous nation. But el-Sisi is reviled by the Islamist opposition, which sees him as the mastermind of a coup against an elected leader and the author of a fierce crackdown on dissent. CNN's Schams Elwazer, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Heba Fahmy and Neda Farshbaf contributed to this report.","A third bomb explodes outside Cairo University .

"(CNN) -- An 84-year-old nun was sentenced to 35 months in prison Tuesday for breaking into a nuclear facility, her lawyer said. In May, a federal jury in Knoxville, Tennessee, found Sister Megan Rice; Greg Boertje-Obed, 57; and Michael Walli, 63, guilty of destroying U.S. government property and causing more than $1,000 in damage to federal property. It was not immediately clear what the sentences were for the two other peace activists. The incident began before dawn on July 28, 2012, when the three cut through a chain-link fence surrounding the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. They then walked nearly a mile, cutting through three more fences and breaching what was supposed to be the most tightly secured uranium processing and storage facility in the country. It was not until hours later that a guard finally confronted the activists who, by then, had hoisted banners, spray-painted messages and splattered human blood on a building that houses highly enriched uranium. ""They're at peace about this. They're peacemakers, and they knew that they risked this,"" Joe Quigley, attorney for Walli, told CNN affiliate WATE in May after their trial. ""Nobody is happy to go jail, but they understand."" In response to the incident, Congress has held a series of hearings and issued security recommendations to the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs Y-12 and seven other nuclear weapons sites. In March, Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the Department of Energy had taken ""several major actions ... to improve security"" since the breach, including management changes and independent security reviews.

"(CNN) -- In a historic fine, HSBC will pay out a record $1.92 billion to U.S. authorities to settle money laundering accusations -- activities which have allegedly occurred with drug cartels in Mexico and terror-linked groups in Saudi Arabia. U.S. authorities declared HSBC, the UK's biggest bank by market capitalization, in breach of a series of U.S. laws, including the Trading with the Enemy Act. ""We accept responsibility for our past mistakes. We have said we are profoundly sorry for them, and we do so again. The HSBC of today is a fundamentally different organization from the one that made those mistakes,"" HSBC Group CEO Stuart Gulliver, said in a statement. On Monday, Standard Chartered, the UK's second largest bank by market value, agreed to pay $327 million to settle U.S. Treasury Department charges of violating sanctions on transactions with Iran, Burma, Libya and Sudan between 2001 and 2007. In August  Standard Chartered paid $340 million to the state of New York's Department of Financial Services to settle civil charges alleging it had concealed $250 billion in illegal transactions with Iran. But while this week's fines are record fees, they are not earth-shattering when compared to the billions of dollars the banks boast in market values, assets and profits. According to Quartz, it will take HSBC a mere 41 days to earn back the $1.9 billion fine. ""These banks are big and you can argue that these kinds of settlements have some mitigating effect on risk-taking,"" says Gary Biddle, professor of accounting at the University of Hong Kong. But ""HSBC has about a $123 billion market cap today so its ($1.9 billion) fine is about 1%. This is not a huge amount. The stock price will vary that much in any given day anyway."" Indeed, HSBC's share price appears to have not suffered in light of these charges. In Hong Kong trading, HSBC Holdings rose 0.31% by mid-day Tuesday. Since news of HSBC's allegations hit in mid-July, HSBC's share price in Hong Kong has risen 16.3%. In the same time period in London trading, its share price has risen nearly 15%. Since the start of 2009, there have been at least 21 instances where global banks and financial institutions have been fined -- predominantly by U.S. authorities. Cases include a $536 million fine against Credit Suisse in December 2009 for allowing clients in Iran, Libya and Cuba to conduct financial transactions; a $335 million fine against Bank of America on racial discrimination charges in lending rates; and a $619 million fine against ING Bank NV that involved a cover-up of fund transfers that violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba and Iran. Biddle says bank improprieties will continue as long as governments continue to back them -- fallout from the 2008 financial crisis when the U.S. labeled some banks: ""Too big to fail."" ""The obvious natural consequence of governments bailing out banks, or any industry for that matter,"" says Biddle, ""is that executives are able to take on more risk (and) governments bailing out banks puts us all at risk.""

"(CNN) -- According to a new survey from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, three-quarters of U.S. adults who own smartphones use those devices to get some kind of real-time location-based information -- from maps and directions all the way to cutting-edge features like Yelp's Monocle augmented-reality view. That's up considerably from last year's figure of 55%. Still, mobile location-based services are clearly not for everyone. The flip side of these Pew numbers means that one in four smartphone-owning U.S. adults do not use the maps, navigation or other location-related services these devices provide. I was surprised by this. Who would invest in buying a smartphone (which usually costs considerably more than the simpler ""feature phones"" still used by more than half of U.S. adults) and not at least use the built-in maps and navigation? This seems to be one of the most basic and universally useful advantages these devices provide. It sounds a bit like buying a computer and Internet access, but never searching with Google. But apparently one in four smartphone owners doesn't see the need, or doesn't know how, to use mobile maps, navigation or location-related services. Of course, not all smartphones are created equal. For instance, according to comScore, about 12% of U.S. smartphones currently in use are still BlackBerry models, many of which have limited or clunky mapping capabilities. But that would only explain half the mystery. Older Americans might be another missing piece of this puzzle. According to Pew, 34% of Americans age 50-64 own smartphones, plus 13% of Americans over 65. But a little more than one-third of smartphone-owning Americans older than 50 don't use location-based information or services on their phones -- one of the lowest adoption rates for any of the demographics Pew examined. Similarly, Pew found that only 66% of smartphone-owning African-American adults use location-based information or services on their phones -- significantly less than whites (76%) and Hispanics (71%). This is a bit puzzling, since more African-Americans (44%) tend to own smartphones, compared to the U.S. population at large (36%), according to a recent Nielsen report. Educational attainment also appears to be a factor. About one-third of American smartphone owners whose education went no further than high school don't use location info or services on their phones. Also, the less money you earn, the less likely you are to use mobile maps or navigation: only 69% of smartphone-owning adults earning $40,000 per year or less do this, compared to 79% of those earning $75,000 per year or more. The fact that your phone always knows where you are enables not just mobile maps and navigation, but also ""geosocial"" place check-in services such as Foursquare, Facebook Places and Google Latitude. Pew found that 18% of all U.S. smartphone owners use geosocial services. That's up from 12% a year ago -- but it's still not a hugely popular activity among U.S smartphone owners. This statistic makes a little more sense to me. The perceived ""value"" of Foursquare and other place check-ins varies widely by user. It's really difficult for a lot of people to see the point of place check-ins. For instance, I've logged more than 1,200 Foursquare check-ins, but I couldn't care less about how many badges I've earned there, whether I'm the ""mayor"" of anyplace, or who's on my ""leaderboard."" In fact, I almost never look at my Foursquare account. Rather, I enjoy taking and posting photos from my phone using services that also let me specify a check-in location, in order to provide context and connection. This lets me easily find other people's photos from those places, and they can easily find mine. So I use Instagram (and before that was available on Android, PicPlz) to check in to Foursquare as well as Twitter and Facebook when I post a photo. This way, I can easily share not just pictures and information but also a sense of place with my friends and others. In other words, Foursquare has become a popular but indirect engine for location awareness, which is a far bigger deal (and more fun) than its game mechanics. Pew's numbers on exactly who's using mobile geosocial services are intriguing. Women -- who often are assumed to have more security or privacy concerns about revealing their location -- are actually slightly more likely (20%) to use geosocial services on their phones than men (17%). Also, Hispanics (23%) and African-Americans (21%) were slightly more likely to use these services than whites (17%). Wealthier people (from households earning $75,000 per year or more) are far less likely (15%) to use mobile geosocial services than people from households earning less than $40,000 per year (23%). Also, these services are less popular with college graduates (16%) than with people who hold only a high school diploma or less (20%). For the most part, who's most likely to use mobile geosocial services is almost the inverse of who's most likely to use mobile maps and navigation. This is odd -- one would think geosocial services and mobile maps and navigation would go hand in hand. And in fact, many smartphone owners undoubtedly use both. But so far the appeal of these tools and services is far from universal.","Pew: Three-quarters of U.S. smartphone owners use location-based apps .

"(CNN) -- OK, so you've resolved to lose weight, travel more and organize your finances in 2014. That's a good start. But what about your virtual self? The dawn of a new year is also a good time for a digital makeover: a savvier, more disciplined approach to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social platforms. Given that 73% of online U.S. adults are active on social media, according to a new Pew survey, this could have a bigger impact on your life than cleaning out that overstuffed closet. May we present these seven resolutions -- suggestions, really -- for better social-media use in the new year. Don't post pictures of all your meals . Sure, the tuna tartare at that fancy restaurant sure looks pretty. But interrupting your dinner to Instagram it is rude to your dining companions, not to mention obnoxious for other people sitting nearby who have to endure your camera flashes and ""which filter looks better?"" questions. Some restaurants have even witnessed food ""photographers"" climb atop their chairs to get a better camera angle. Don't be that person. Try limiting your food pics to special items like a customized birthday cake or maybe that famous 2-pound burger you must finish to earn a free T-shirt and your photo on the pub wall. Think before you tweet . OK, this one may seem obvious. But it's amazing how many otherwise smart people blast out thoughts on Twitter without pausing to consider the sheer stupidity of what they're saying. In August, TV's Dr. Phil McGraw sparked a backlash after a tweet posted on his verified Twitter account asked whether it's OK to have sex with a drunk girl. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before the Internet erupted in outrage. Then there was Justine Sacco, the PR executive who posted this on Twitter this month before boarding a flight to South Africa: ""Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!"" The tweet went viral while her plane was in the air, and she was fired soon after. It takes only a few seconds to compose a dumb tweet. The damage can last much longer. Don't tag people in unflattering photos . Hey, buddy! I tagged you in this party pic! Yeah, I know your eyes are closed, your stomach is sticking out and your tongue is caressing a bottle of tequila, but it's hilarious, right! Right? No? Oops. Ask permission before posting questionable photos of people online. It's just common courtesy. Fact-check first . No, Tom Cruise didn't die in April in a car accident in Australia. But you wouldn't know that right away from all the breathless posts on Facebook and Twitter. Then there are the fake Facebook posts, offering cheap airfare or free iPads, that try to scam you with malicious links. Social media can spread misinformation as fast as truths. Unless you want your friends to stop trusting you, Snopes.com is a good source for debunking these rumors. Or you could just use common sense. Remember that less can be more . An artfully rendered Instagram photo of your baby or cat or snowy backyard can be a beautiful thing. Seven photos in an hour, not so much. The same can apply to rapid-fire tweeting or constant Facebook updates. Unless you're live-blogging from a forest fire or the Oscars, don't overwhelm your friends' feeds. They will thank you. Go easy on the selfies . Yes, ""selfie"" is the word of the year for 2013. And selfies can be fun to look at when the person is 1. wearing a costume, 2. with a celebrity or 3. standing in front of the Eiffel Tower. Preferably all three at once. But we don't really need to see you in front of your bathroom mirror, making a duck face. By its nature, social media is already narcissistic enough. Be your authentic self . Unless, maybe, you're Anthony Weiner. There is now a whole corps of ""social media experts"" who will tell you ""how to build your personal brand."" Ignore them. The nature of networking hasn't really changed -- it's still about who you know, staying in touch and being willing to put yourself out there -- and no number of marketing gimmicks will change that. Be genuine. Be someone you'd enjoy talking to at a party. If you're using social media only to collect likes and followers, you're probably doing something wrong. But you still might want to hold off on those knee-jerk Twitter rants or Vines of yourself naked. CNN's Todd Leopold contributed to this story.","The dawn of a new year is also a good time for a digital makeover .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Army Sgt. Timothy Owens will be remembered as many things. A son, a husband, a father. A victim of Wednesday's shooting at Fort Hood, Owens loved the Army and planned to make it his career. ""He didn't answer the phone so I left a message on his phone. 'Son, call me so I know if you're OK or not.' Well, never got no call from him. I thought: 'Oh God, please don't let it be,'"" his mother, Mary Muntean, told CNN Springfield, Illinois, affiliate WICS on Thursday. ""Very terrible that they had to shoot my son. He was a good person. Why would they shoot a good person that was helping them?"" Owens is survived by his mother, his wife and two children, according to a family statement. One of his children mourned his passing on Facebook. ""Today at fort hood there was a shooting...my father sadly died tonight .... I still feel like it's all a dream.... Can't feel anything,"" wrote Loredana Owens. ""I just want everyone to think for a moment .... If you have family your fighting with forgive them, love them, because you never know when there gonna be taken from you ..... I love dad and I hate that you were taken away from me .... I love you daddy"" Owens was one of three people killed when a gunman opened fire at the sprawling Texas Army post. The shooting suspect, 34-year-old Spc. Ivan Lopez, also died, of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Sixteen other people were injured. Owens was described by his family as outgoing. He enjoyed taekwondo. His uncle said his nephew was an honorable man, someone who never met a stranger. ""You see it happening, but you never know that it's going to come to you. It's just very disturbing,"" Wallace Gerhardt told WICS. ""You'd think that they'd have more security and be able to more ready for something like that to happen. I just don't understand.""","U.S. Army Sgt. Timothy Owens was killed at Fort Hood on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A message thought to be from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri criticizes the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and urges Muslims to stand together to prevent Egypt from being divided. The 14-minute audio message -- which purportedly is al-Zawahiri's second this week -- was posted to jihadist forums on Friday. CNN could not independently verify its authenticity. The language used in the last posting resembles that in other messages attributed to al-Zawahiri in which he criticizes the treatment from various parties of Morsy, the former Muslim Brotherhood leader who last year became Egypt's first democratically elected president. ""The crusaders, the seculars, the Americanized army, (former President Hosni) Mubarak's thugs and some members of Islamic parties with the support of Gulf money and American plotting, all agreed to topple Mohamed Morsy's government,"" he says. Who is Ayman al-Zawahiri? Those behind Morsy's ouster, the message states, wanted a ""secular, pro-American president to rule Egypt so they can continue with their plotting -- along with the Americans and Zionists -- to divide Egypt, just like what happened in Sudan."" The 62-year-old Al-Zawahiri is no stranger to Egypt or its politics. A member of a distinguished Egyptian family, he is a surgeon who with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad tried to overthrow President Anwar Sadat and establish an Islamic state. After Sadat's assassination, al-Zawahiri was arrested and convicted on weapons charges. He met Osama bin Laden in the late 1980s and, in about a decade later, merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad with al Qaeda. Al Qaeda's boss asserts himself . The message posted Friday comes three days days after another message purportedly from al-Zawahiri appeared online, although it was believed to be recorded June 5. In that message, the voice purportedly of al-Zawahiri denounced U.S. treatment of hunger-striking detainees at its Guantanamo Bay military prison and pledged to free them. He also urged Muslims -- as he and other al Qaeda leaders have many times before -- to unite and fight. ""Every Muslim in every spot on Earth must work to defend the blood of Muslims that is being shed by America and its allies, and their sanctities that they are violating, and their villages and homes that they are destroying, and their wealth that they are stealing,"" he said. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","A message purportedly from Ayman al-Zawahiri is posted to jihadist forums .

"(CNN) -- It's not often that a superyacht is inspired by the work of an obscure 19th-century Ukrainian mathematician. But the astonishingly shaped ""Voronoi"" is exactly that. Still at the design stage, the 125-meter vessel is adorned with a complex lattice exterior that its designer, South Korean industrial architect Hyun-Seok Kim, says is based on an algorithmic diagram by Georgy Voronoy, a math professor who lived under the Russian empire during the late 1800s. ""What is special about the Voronoi diagram is that we also notice it in nature,"" said Kim, who is riding high after winning the 2011 Millennium Yacht Design Awards for an equally eccentric concept inspired by coral reefs and tropical fish. ""If you look at the wings of a dragonfly, the cell membrane of a plant or the fur of a giraffe, for instance, you see the Voronoi pattern over and over,"" said Kim. The 32 year-old designer believes that the unusual exterior would appeal to those looking for a superyacht more in harmony with its natural surroundings. ""Structures based on the Voronoi pattern have an organic, playful, non-repetitive feel,"" said Kim, who also argued that the pattern can create very robust structures with a minimum amount of material, and for this reason is often employed in architecture and engineering. Just never before on a luxury yacht. But the ""Voronoi's"" quirks don't stop at the exterior. Set across five decks, the design includes an indoor swimming pool lined with ancient Greek-styled columns, a sky-lounge, botanical garden and even a small golfing range. So will it ever be built? ""I certainly hope so,"" said Kim, who admitted that its non-repetitive structure is an impediment to manufacturers because each segment requires different moulds. He added: ""For future yacht designs I will focus on the commercial market ... however it isn't easy, I like futuristic yachts much more!""","""Voronoi"" superyacht has honeycomb exterior based on shapes found in natural world .

"(CNN) -- The United States faces ""a 10-year issue"" in Syria as it weighs how deeply it wants to get involved the country's civil war, the top U.S. military officer warned in an interview that aired Sunday. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey told CNN's State of the Union that the conflict is entwined in a regional issue that is now spilling over into both Lebanon and Iraq, and those underlying causes ""will persist for 10 years."" ""It is related -- not exclusively -- but related to a competition at best and a conflict at worse between the Sunni and Shia sects of Islam, and it's been hijacked at some level on both sides by extremists -- al Qaeda on one side and Lebanese Hezbollah and others on the other side,"" said Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He added, ""This is about a 10-year issue, and if we fail to think about it as a 10-year regional issue, we could make some mistakes."" Syria's civil war began in early 2011, when the government of President Bashar al-Assad turned police and troops on anti-government demonstrations. The crackdown mushroomed into a conflict that has left more than more than 90,000 dead, according to the United Nations. The Obama administration announced in June that government troops had crossed a ""red line"" by using chemical weapons against rebel forces, prompting it to increase what has so far been non-lethal aid to the opposition. The administration plans to send small arms, ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons to Syria's rebels, officials familiar with the matter told CNN. Critics such as Sen. John McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, call the response too little, too late. ""As usual, on these issues, they're undecided and going forward with a debate while events transpire,"" McCain told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. ""There's no better example of that than Syria, as we continue to watch Hezbollah, thousands of fighters; we see Russian weapons pouring in, and slaughter of now over 100,000 people. And we're going to send them light weapons? Light weapons don't do well against tanks."" But Dempsey,Obama's principal military adviser, told CNN the war in Syria is ""not a simple matter of stopping the fight by the introduction of any particular U.S. capability."" Angelina Jolie turns spotlight on Syria . ""It seems to me that we need to understand what the peace will look like before we start the war,"" he said. What complicates the question of military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al Qaeda sympathies, the same stripe of militants America has battled in Iraq and Afghanistan. They include the al-Nusra Front, a rebel group that the United States says has links to al Qaeda. Meanwhile, the United States has been bolstering efforts to keep the conflict from spreading to Jordan, where an American military presence is quietly growing. And in discussions of the use of air power to enforce a ""no-fly"" zone, as was done in Libya's civil war in 2011, Dempsey has raised concerns about the need for clear objectives and a full understanding of the risks before acting.

"(CNN) -- The main Pakistani Taliban extended a cease-fire deadline until April 10, the militant group said Friday. The move came two days after the group met with Pakistan officials and made demands. The cease-fire was initially agreed upon on March 1. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which has been waging an insurgency against the Pakistani government, said it is still awaiting a reply from the government regarding the demands, including the release of noncombatants. At least 19 Taliban noncombatants were released earlier on the directive of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said Shaukatullah Khan, governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The release is a goodwill gesture that will help promote peace talks, Khan said, speaking at a seminar in Peshawar. The prime minister is supervising the talks process, which are going in a positive direction, according to Khan. In the first direct contact between the two sides, Pakistani government representatives met the Taliban for peace talks Wednesday in the tribal region of North Waziristan. The government team flew by helicopter from Peshawar to meet the Taliban negotiators at an undisclosed location, sources and state media said. TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid told CNN the talks, which ended Wednesday evening, were held in a conducive environment. He said a consensus emerged on the exchange of noncombatants held by both sides. Sharif announced the peace initiative this year, but talks broke down last month in the wake of attacks by the Taliban. The militants, who are fighting for their austere version of Sharia law across Pakistan, have repeatedly rejected the country's constitution. Since taking office last year, Sharif faced mounting pressure to bring the violence under control. Journalist Zahir Shah Sherazi reported from Peshawar, Pakistan, and CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report from Los Angeles.","Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan's cease-fire with Pakistani government extended to April 10 .

"(CNN) -- For five days, same-sex couples could get married in Australia's capital city of Canberra. Those who did were the first in the country to do so. But that fleeting window was slammed shut Thursday by the Australian High Court, which ruled that a recent local law legalizing same-sex marriage was invalid. That means that the marriages of the couples who took advantage of the law to tie the knot -- 27 according to local media -- will be annulled. ""This is devastating for those couples who married this week and for their families,"" said Rodney Croome, the national director of the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality. ""However, this is just a temporary defeat."" The Australian court's decision is the latest setback for gay rights in the Asia-Pacific region. On Wednesday, India's top court ruled that sex between consenting homosexual partners is illegal in the country, prompting dismay from human rights groups. Australian gay rights activists said their fight would now shift to lobbying the national parliament to change federal legislation. The high court said Thursday that the federal Marriage Act, which doesn't permit same-sex marriage, takes precedence over the law passed by the legislative assembly in Canberra, also known as the Australian Capital Territory. The lawmakers in the ACT, which has a population of about 380,000 people, would have been aware that their same-sex marriage law wouldn't be allowed to override federal law. But their move has succeeded in fostering renewed debate on the issue in Australia. The activists' goal of changing the federal Marriage Act appears to be a stern challenge, though. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his conservative coalition oppose same-sex marriage. That's despite public pressure from his family. ""Sad news that the ACT same-sex marriage law has been overturned,"" tweeted Abbott's lesbian sister, Christine Forster. ""Focus now firmly on federal parliament,"" wrote Forster, who is a lcouncil member in Sydney. Earlier this year, Australian neighbor New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage. CNN's John Raedler contributed to this report.","A law in Canberra, Australia, allowing same-sex marriage is declared invalid .

"(CNN) -- When Marita Cheng was told to clean her room as a child, she imagined an army of robots doing the dirty work for her. ""I looked around and I didn't see any robots helping me with the household chores,"" the 24-year-old engineering whiz said. ""And I thought: 'I want to be part of making robots a reality.'"" Speaking to Cheng, one of Australia's brightest young scientists, you get the feeling there's not much she couldn't solve with a bit of brain power. Her latest project? Creating a bionic arm that could revolutionize the lives of quadriplegics around the world. Young gun . Watching Cheng speaking to a packed Sydney Opera House crowd at one of her TEDx talks, it's hard not to get swept up in her effervescent and eloquent ""can-do"" view of the world. ""Why are we as a country doing such a bad job at inspiring the next generation of engineers?"" she asks, microphone headpiece strapped on, before clicking to her next slide show on a giant screen behind. Has she always been this confident? ""I don't know, I guess I get scared all the time really,"" she says, speaking by phone above the din of Melbourne trams trundling past. Robogals . In 2012, Cheng was named ""Young Australian of the Year,"" a hugely prestigious award that saw her join the ranks of other remarkable youngsters Jessica Watson, the youngest person to single-handedly sail around the world, and swimmer Ian Thorpe, the country's most successful Olympian. Cheng quickly learned to become comfortable on stage, in the following year giving 150 lectures on her work that combined science and, rather unusually, feminism. While an engineering student at Melbourne University -- one of just five women in a class of over 50 men -- Cheng founded Robogals, a group of students encouraging girls to get involved in science and technology. Just 11% of engineers in Australia are women -- it's a similar story the U.S. (14%) and Britain (9%) --and Cheng felt compelled to show a new generation of girls that science could be fulfilling and even, wait for it, cool. ""There's this perception that engineering is for men, and girls don't do that,"" she said. ""When I go to expos for Robogals, I get young girls come up to me and say: 'Oh my brother might be interested in this.' But I'm like: 'No, this is something you can do, it's really fun.' They don't even realize it's a possibility before you tell them that it is.""

When Cheng recently graduated with a degree in Mechatronics and Computer Science, she had the choice of hundreds of job offers. Instead, she decided to strike out on her own, founding 2Mar Robotics -- a company ""focused on building beautiful robots that help us in our everyday lives."" The team is now working on a bionic arm -- called ""Jeva"" -- which would help quadriplegics. Mounted on a wheelchair, the high-tech limb would be voice-operated and able to remember and repeat common tasks. ""I was still finishing my studies off and I thought: 'What do I want to do? What's a cool, fun thing to do? What will make me feel fulfilled? What will give me purpose in my life?'"" said Cheng. The lucky country . Growing up in a social housing estate in tropical north Queensland, the determined young woman says her mom, a single-parent and hotel cleaner, was a huge influence in her life. ""She always just did what she had to do, and that's what I saw as a kid."" Does she think Australians are too laid back when it comes to technology? ""I think we could have more of a vision for the future,"" she says. ""Otherwise, if you're just focused on the past, then there'll be other countries that are more hungry, more innovative, and doing their best to work towards a better future.""

"(CNN) -- Note to self: When soliciting for drugs on Twitter, try a direct message. Facing another boring day at work, a Toronto car repair shop worker decided some weed would be just the thing to make the day fly by. Instead of reaching out by phone or walking to his friendly neighborhood drug dealer, the user, using the handle @Sunith_DB8R, tweeted that he needed a joint delivered to his workplace in Vaughan, just north of Toronto.

Then, retreat. ""People really think I'm serious with my tweets? MANNNNNNNN."" Finally, shame. ""Can't lie, stupid move but would y'all have noticed that tweet if YRP didn't retweet it?""

Canadian broadcaster CTV reached out to the manager of the repair shop, who said ""there was an employee here by that name; he no longer works for us.""

After ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius became the first double-amputee runner to compete at an Olympics, and Natalie Du Toit excelled in the pool, Lucas Sithole -- who lost both his legs and most of his right arm when he fell under a train aged 12 -- became the first South African to win a title at tennis' U.S. Open. ""Natalie made a huge impact on South African sport, the same as Oscar,"" the nation's Davis Cup captain, John-Laffnie De Jager, told CNN. ""Lucas can play the same role."" Judging by the welcome he received in Johannesburg following his historic victory in New York in September, Sithole is well on his way. A large crowd greeted Sithole at OR Tambo International Airport, where he signed posters that read, ""Rolling Inspiration."" Reflecting on the scene, Sithole was still genuinely surprised. And why wouldn't he be? Such receptions for wheelchair tennis champions are highly unusual. ""I wasn't expecting it but at the end of the day I was happy to be honored like that,"" the 27-year-old told CNN. ""People were calling my name and it was nice to get recognized even if I'm only in wheelchair tennis. It was actually awesome, man. ""Later on, even when I went from my house to the shop to buy bread, people still recognized me. I have no problem with that."" Boost for African tennis . His emergence as a tennis ace comes at a good time for South Africa, since the country's No. 1 in the ATP ranks, Kevin Anderson, hasn't played in the Davis Cup for two years. Anderson is married to an American and last year in an interview with the New York Times didn't rule out representing the U.S. in the future. Liezel Huber, a former No. 1 in women's doubles, already changed her nationality, becoming an American citizen six years ago. She has since won three U.S. Open doubles titles. And some will say Sithole can take over from Pistorius in capturing the hearts of South Africans after the latter's fall from grace. There is no doubting that Pistorius' exploits on the track led to plaudits and a massive following -- without the use of half his legs he reached the semifinals at London 2012 competing against able-bodied athletes -- but his reputation has suffered since he was accused of murdering his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. ""Lucas is fortunate that people in South Africa have already recognized athletes with a disability probably stronger than other countries,"" says Sithole's coach, Holger Losch. South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, sent Sithole a message of congratulations for his achievement at Flushing Meadows when he downed David Wagner on the latter's home soil. ""It was no small feat,"" Zuma said in a statement. ""He has made both the government and the people of South Africa immensely proud."" Even if the attendance on Court 11 couldn't match the buzz for the men's final between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic on gargantuan Arthur Ashe Stadium, the atmosphere was nonetheless raucous. Shouts of ""USA, USA"" were meant to encourage Wagner but Sithole rallied from a set down to beat the world No. 1 in three sets, shedding tears of joy when the finale concluded. A left-hander like Nadal, Sithole also hits with heavy spin on his forehand. Prior to his accident -- Sithole said he preferred ""not to go back there"" when the incident was brought up in this interview -- he hadn't seen anyone play tennis. He picked up his first racquet only about seven years ago. ""Certainly I thought that Lucas could be a force in the future but I just didn't know how long it would take him,"" Wagner, who plays with his racquet taped to his right hand, told CNN. ""He's very quick around the court and has good chair skills and some big shots."" Sithole and Wagner -- who are occasional doubles partners -- developed a rivalry in 2013, meeting nine times in singles since the end of May, and more battles are expected next year given they are the top two in the quads rankings. Thinking further ahead, Sithole aims to be on the podium at the 2016 Paralympics in Rio. Wagner beat a then unseeded Sithole in the first round of the Paralympics in London a year ago. 'Double bagel' start . Sithole contested his first international wheelchair event in 2006 in the Netherlands, home to the most dominant wheelchair player of all time, Esther Vergeer. Wagner beat him in doubles and Sithole lost his opening singles match by the dreaded ""double bagel"" score of 6-0 6-0. ""He's done exceptionally well to get to where he is now in a short time,"" said Losch. ""His character is the thing that drives him the hardest and he relishes playing on the big stage. He's very competitive. ""If you look at Lucas physically you'd think of all kinds of reasons he'd struggle to do stuff but when you get to know him, you see that he takes on challenges. He lives his life to the fullest."" Attending a primary and secondary school for the physically disabled changed Sithole's mindset for the better as he saw fellow students thriving. And that has come full circle, as pupils from one of his former schools were among those who saluted him at the airport. Amassing more grand slam titles will only strengthen Sithole's profile, said De Jager, who rose to No. 11 in the world in doubles after overcoming a heart condition at birth. ""I think it's going to be key for him now to keep improving and try and win some more big tournaments,"" he said. ""I think if that happens it would be huge for tennis in South Africa, especially wheelchair tennis.""","Lucas Sithole became the first South African citizen to win a U.S. Open tennis title .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian intelligence agencies have arrested Yasin Bhatkal, one of the country's most wanted terrorism suspects, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said Thursday. Bhatkal is believed to be a co-founder of the Indian Mujahideen, a militant group banned in India and listed by the United States as a foreign terrorist organization. Intelligence officials arrested him Wednesday in the eastern state of Bihar, near India's border with Nepal, Shinde said. ""He is currently under Bihar Police's custody and is being interrogated,"" he said. The U.S. State Department said in 2011 that the Indian Mujahideen has ""significant links to Pakistan"" and is responsible for ""dozens of bomb attacks throughout India since 2005"" that have caused the deaths of hundreds of civilians. Bhatkal is wanted in relation to multiple bombings in Mumbai in July 2011 that killed 27 people in three busy marketplaces. Indian authorities suspect him of planning those attacks. He is accused of masterminding several other bombings, including one that hit a bakery in the city of Pune in 2010, killing 17 people. His group has been linked to a series of deadly outbreaks of violence in India. The U.S. State Department says the Indian Mujahideen played a ""facilitative role"" in the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, when coordinated attacks on hotels, hospitals, and railway stations left more than 160 people dead. The group is also responsible for 16 synchronized bombings in Ahmedabad in 2008 that left 38 people dead, according to the State Department. The Indian Mujahideen's ""stated goal is to carry out terrorist actions against non-Muslims in furtherance of its ultimate objective -- an Islamic Caliphate across South Asia,"" the State Department says. Journalist Neha Sharma reported from New Delhi, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","Yasin Bhatkal is arrested near the border with Nepal, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- When night falls over Rwanda, many rural communities far removed from the country's electricity grid descend into darkness. Unplugged from the power lines, households in these areas rely mainly on fuel-based devices such as kerosene lamps for access to light. Such lanterns, however, are polluting and costly: They emit toxic fumes, pose fire hazards and also put a strain on family budgets. But recently, an innovative solution has emerged to offer affordable and efficient electricity to low-income households while benefiting the communities by providing jobs to local populations. Called POWERcycle, Nuru Energy says it has developed ""the world's first commercially available pedal generator"" -- a foot or hand-powered device that can recharge up to five modular light emitting diode (LED) lamps in approximately 20 minutes, as well as power mobile phones and radios. Read also: Bamboo bikes put Zambian business on right track . The company says each of its portable LED lamps provides one week of light to a rural household. It also claims that its products are more affordable and reliable than other forms of off-grid offerings that have been developed in recent years, including solar lamps or home solar lighting systems. ""We looked around and said, well, what is the one energy resource that's untapped in this environment? And human power really came to mind,"" says Sameer Hajee, chief executive and co-founder of Nuru Energy. ""We thought, well, if we can harness human energy in a way that we can create economic opportunity and low-power electricity, wouldn't that be a game changing solution?"" Watch: Can handmade bicycles change lives? According to Lighting Africa, a joint World Bank - IFC program developed to increase access to clean sources of energy for lighting, 589 million people in the continent live without access to a public electricity facility. The group says African poor rural households and small businesses pay $10 billion per year for lighting purposes, while communities not connected to the grid spend $4.4 billion annually on kerosene. Read also: Pay-as-you-go solar power lights up rural Africa . Looking to address the issue of energy poverty, Hajee, a social entrepreneur with a lot of experience in international development, spent more than a month in Rwanda in 2008, trying to figure out what were the energy needs of the country's off-grid population. What he found out was ""actually quite basic [energy needs],"" he says. ""It's light, it's cooking, it's mobile phone recharging and radio."" Read also: Unplugging from the world's power lines . With help from the World Bank, Hajee co-founded Nuru Energy and in 2009 the company started testing its products in the field. Hajee quickly realized, however, that innovative technology was not enough for the project to be successful in a place like rural Rwanda. His company also needed to adopt a creative approach in the distribution front. Read also: Rwanda's B-Boys . ""We couldn't just sell product -- we had to actually get involved in the value chain downstream,"" he says. ""We thought, well, if the generator can recharge five lights so quickly, could this not be the basis of a recharging business for a local entrepreneur?"" As a result, the company decided not to sell its products directly to customers. Instead, it set up a network of village-level entrepreneurs who are responsible for marketing, selling, and recharging the lights. Read also: Experts warn Africa must learn from India's microfinance problems . Hajee says this unique model of distribution has revolutionized the lives of both micro-entrepreneurs and customers. ""If you look at this from the standpoint of the customer,"" says Hajee, ""they would purchase the light for $6 and then they would pay about 20 U.S. cents per week for lighting. This is compared to about $2 a week that they would spend on kerosene before. So it's 10 times cheaper solution for them. ""From the entrepreneur's perspective, in 20 minutes of pedaling, they're recharging five lights, earning about $1 -- any of us that work in Africa know that that's much more than people make in an entire day. So it's a huge value proposition for the customer and for the entrepreneur."" Opinion: Could Africa be world's next manufacturing hub? Hajee notes that this model can easily be emulated across rural Africa. He says that Nuru Energy, which currently focuses on East Africa and India, has already been approached by a number of potential joint venture partners to roll out the project in other parts of the continent. ""I really hope that what we're providing here is a stopgap solution to the immediate energy needs of...rural populations,"" says Hajee. ""What I would really hope is that, you know, there's certainly effort needed in providing grid quality electricity to these populations. It'll take some time.""","589 million people in Africa live without access to a public electricity facility .

"(CNN) -- The official death toll in last month's massive landslide in rural Washington state rose to 29, up one from the previous day, Snohomish County medical examiner's office representative Kelly Stowe said Wednesday. About 15 people remain missing, authorities have said. A rain-saturated hillside along the north fork of the Stillaguamish River gave way on March 22, sending a square-mile rush of wet earth and rock into the outskirts of the town of Oso in the North Cascade Mountains. The landslide left behind a graveyard in the debris, where bodies have been recovered and crews painstakingly search for people who are listed as missing. Rescuers have been trudging through the muck, which is 70 feet thick in some places. Hundreds of people and cadaver dogs are involved in the search, officials have said. Larry Nickey, one of the incident commanders, told reporters Wednesday that he is increasingly using professional teams with extensive training in searching for human remains, and is scaling back the number of volunteers in the field. Nickey said searchers are focusing on areas of the grid where they feel there is a high probability of finding bodies. He said that one body found Wednesday is not yet counted in the official toll. The search is perilous. The debris field is full of toxic sludge -- a combination of human waste, toxic chemicals from households, propane tanks, oil and gas, according to Lt. Richard Burke of the Bellevue Fire Department. Every person, animal and thing that comes out of the field has to be decontaminated. Some of the workers have come down with dysentery, and supervisors are concerned that others may be at risk for tetanus. The weather has been good for the past three days, allowing water to recede from the debris field, but the forecast looks bad, especially for Friday, when the National Weather Service says there is a 100% chance of rain, which will be heavy in spurts. According to CNN affiliate KOMO, a bank with branches in Arlington and Darrington said it would forgive any home loans and car loans that weren't covered by insurance. ""Coastal Community Bank is ready to stand behind our customers, and if they are not insured and they owe us that debt, we will forgive that debt,"" CEO Eric Sprink told KOMO. The station reported that of the dozens of primary residences destroyed, none had landslide insurance. Gov. Jay Inslee has asked the federal government for assistance, including disaster grants. As searches continued, a major state university said it was ready to help its students from the area. Washington State University will waive tuition for the next academic year for students directly affected by the slide, specifically students with permanent addresses in Oso or nearby Darrington, university spokeswoman Kathryn Barnard said Wednesday. The number of students this could affect wasn't immediately clear. Darrington has about 450 students enrolled in its school system. CNN's Ana Cabrera contributed to this report.","NEW: About 15 people are still missing .

"(CNN) -- Facebook has so many users -- more than a billion, or roughly the population of India -- that squeezing them all into one Web page seems almost impossible. And yet someone has done just that. A new project, ""The Faces of Facebook,"" collects more than 1.27 billion Facebook profile photos on one site, arranged in chronological order according to when the person joined the social network. Users can sign in via Facebook to pinpoint their photo on the page and see where they show up in relation to their friends. At first glance, the site looks like colorful, pixelated white noise. But users can zoom in to see individual photos and then scroll around or click on a photo to visit that person's Facebook page. (Be warned, however: the page is experiencing heavy traffic and can be slow and buggy.) The site launched last week and was built by Natalia Rojas, a self-described ""creative technologist"" in Barcelona, Spain. ""I was playing around with Facebook API, and I discovered that there is a way to access everyone's public information with a very simple (but not obvious) algorithm,"" she said in an e-mail to CNN. ""At that time, I thought I could do something beautiful/interesting with that, like showing them all together. Then I started to write the code to achieve it."" Rojas said she is not breaking Facebook privacy rules because she is not storing anyone's name, photo or private information -- just linking out to public Facebook profiles. She also said she hasn't heard from the social network, which she thinks is good news because ""I was a bit worried about things like using their name in the URL."" Facebook did not repond to CNN's request for comment. Rojas said it took her a year and a half to code the site. The hardest part, she said, was stripping out the default silhouette images that appear on some inactive Facebook profiles. Asked about her hopes for the project, Rojas said she was inspired by the idea that each Facebook profile photo is an example of that person's best self, and that millions of those images together combine to present a positive, universal message. ""There is a mix of people from all over the world. And somehow we are all telling our friends: 'Look, this is me, when I like myself.' Feeling happy, being creative, looking good, being passionate about something, proud of something, enjoying the life,"" she said. ""So I think, why don't we try to BE our Facebook profile picture? Even if life is difficult some times, there is always a way for us to be what we want to be: happy.""","New Web page shows profile photos of 1.2 billion Facebook users .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- When Priya and Rajendra Kachroo dropped their only son Aman off at medical school, they were both proud and tired. They had to hurry home to care for an ailing elderly parent. ""It was a fast drop,"" recalled Aman's father, Rajendra Kachroo. Neither had any idea what their son was about to face or they never would have left him there. Aman Kachroo, 19, a freshman (or ""fresher,"" as they are called in India) was about to embark on a torturous six months that would end his life. Aman, along with his new dorm mates, suddenly became the target of ""ragging,"" a form of bullying or hazing usually inflicted by upperclassmen on freshman. Taller than his classmates, handsome and fluent in French, English, and conversational Hindi, Aman was wise beyond his years, his parents say. He had always been able to sort his problems out himself so they couldn't imagine him being intimidated. ""There is a whole guilt factor involved in all this that I didn't know [what was going on],"" his mom Priya Kachroo said. ""Really, I couldn't understand the size of this problem."" His parents knew something was going on when Aman came home from Tanda Medical College in Himachal Pradesh State and his hair had been sheered off. His parents said he told them that he was being ragged but not to worry about it because it would end. And it did. For him, it stopped after one night in 2009 when he was woken up by a group of seniors who made him and all his dorm mates stand in a line and then began beating them. Aman later died of a head injury. His father talked to him on the phone in the hours before he died and heard about what happened. Then, abruptly, his son was gone. When relatives went to Aman's dorm room to pick up his things, they found a note with the word ""ragging"" circled in the middle and words and phrases surrounding it such as, ""Prison like torture,"" ""dictator"" and ""Please talk to us don't slap us."" It was Aman's innermost thoughts about ragging and how terrible it felt. In the hours before he died, he also managed to write a letter of complaint to police describing what happened. His father later read the complaint and was horrified. ""Not easy even to think about it. It's not easy. It is very difficult,"" Rajendra Kuchroo said tearfully. Aman's death two years ago triggered national outrage. Four medical students were later convicted of culpable homicide. But his is not the first, nor the last case to end in tragedy in India. Over the years, ragging on college campuses has resulted in dozens of student suicides, students being admitted to mental institutions, or students simply leaving prestigious schools that less than 1 percent of the population can get into. Rajendra Kuchroo says since his son's case he has seen more than 30 reported suicides allegedly linked to ragging. The Kachroo case did effect some change, in part because Aman's father decided to dedicate his life to ending the torturous behavior in schools. Now, some campuses enforce a zero tolerance policy on ragging. And Aman's father took the case to the country's Supreme Court and managed to get an order setting up parameters on ways to prevent ragging. Now, two years later, inside a bright blue- and orange-colored room, a half-dozen young people are chatting away on phone headsets. But it's not a typical Indian call center, apparent with the initial phone greeting: . ""You have reached the Anti-Ragging Helpline,"" a young lady chirps. The helpline was just one part of Rajendra Kuchroo's plan to do something about ragging. Students can call anonymously to lodge complaints about any ragging behavior. In its first six months of operation, he says the center received 150,000 calls from students saying they were victims. ""Those numbers in the last two years have gone to 250,000 calls with 850 serious complaints, and we still believe this is only the tip of the iceberg,"" Rajendra Kuchroo said. He says he'll keep fighting every day in India until the day the phones at the complaint center fall silent -- because students are no longer being victimized by ragging at school.","In India, ""ragging"" is a bullying or hazing usually in college .

"(CNN) -- The New Jersey General Assembly passed a medical marijuana bill Monday that will ""ease access"" and expand patient options, including allowing qualified children to consume edible forms of marijuana. The bill, which has undergone numerous amendments, has passed in the Senate and needs Gov. Chris Christie's signature to become law. Christie vetoed the original bill in August and said he would sign legislation that included a rule that edible marijuana would be dispensed only to minors and that a psychiatrist and a physician both would have to approve before a minor could join the program. The final version of the bill -- which was approved in a 70-1-4 vote -- includes both of Christie's demands, according to a news release from the New Jersey Assembly Democrats. Christie said last month he was worried about going ""down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that wouldn't necessarily go to other people."" The bill was originally proposed after Brian and Meghan Wilson of Union City began a campaign to get what could be life-saving treatment for their 2-year old daughter, Vivian. She suffers from Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy for which anti-seizure medicine is ineffective, according to the news release. ""For Vivian and many children like her, marijuana may be the only treatment that can provide life-changing relief,"" Assemblywoman Linda Stender, who sponsored the bill, said in the news release. ""As a state, we should not stand in the way of that, and today's vote is definitely a step forward."" The bill also removes the limit on the marijuana strains that may be cultivated and requires parental permission, according to the release. If Christie signs the bill, it would make edible marijuana available to minors through tablets, capsules, drops or syrups, according to the release. ""We are happy that this is finally being signed into law,"" Brian and Meghan Wilson said in a statement. ""Our next focus will be working ...to ensure that this law is properly regulated according to the true intent of the law so that Vivian and all of the other patients in New Jersey can finally start getting the type of medicine they need in the form they need."" Stender told CNN that this was a great step but that there is still work to be done, citing the requirement of two to three doctors' approvals for a minor to be prescribed medical marijuana. Opinions on the use of marijuana, particularly for medical purposes, have shifted in the United States in recent years, with a growing number of people saying that it should be made available by prescription. ""Protection of our children remains my utmost concern, and my heart goes out to those children and their families who are suffering with serious illnesses,"" Christie said last month. Lorenzo Ferrigno Bryan Koenig, William Hudson and Kristen Kiraly contributed to this report.","Changes to New Jersey medical marijuana rules pass Assembly .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- A woman of many talents, Haddy Jatou N'jie is one of Scandinavia's rising stars. With a Gambian father and a Norwegian mother, she is both a successful singer with three solo music albums under her belt and a famous TV presenter, having hosted, among others, the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest from her hometown of Oslo. ""I can do whatever what I want, I can define myself in whatever way I want,"" N'jie told CNN from the capital of Norway. ""As a journalist, as a writer, as an artist, musician, black or white, Gambian or Norwegian, and no one can tell me I can't be this, I can't be that."" N'jie's multifarious personality has earned her celebrity status in Norway -- the fun-loving and free speaking performer has grown to become one of the country's most instantly recognizable faces. She says she needs to live ""an asymmetrical life,"" one that embraces all the different elements that have shaped her upbringing. ""People always ask me, 'What is the most important thing for you? Is it the music, the journalism, what's most important for you?' I need all of it. If I just do music, I get so tired of myself after a while that I have to do something else, and when I'm just a journalist I really need to sing and write music or express myself in a more subjective way, so I need it all."" Born in Oslo in 1979, N'jie says her life has been much the same as anyone else's but she's quick to admit that growing up as a black person in Norway has impacted her in many ways. ""When it comes to my identity as a Gambian-Norwegian, my knowledge is really more about being a visible minority in Norway and being black in a white country. ""From a very early age I started thinking, 'Who am I, where do I belong and what kind of person do I want to be?' So I started to make my own platform in a way, somewhere I could be without people, without having to defend myself in a way...I have my own room where I can be Gambian, Norwegian, black or white."" One of her jobs as a presenter is to host an annual fundraising telethon for Norwegian broadcaster NRK that raises money for noteworthy causes. This year's proceeds will be used to help and protect people fleeing from conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and Sudan, among others. Much of N'jie's knowledge about Africa comes from her Gambian father, but she's also traveled to the continent on a number of occasions. She recently visited the world's largest refugee camp in Dadaab, Kenya -- a trip that she says had a profound impact on her. ""I met young people that are really ambitious, that really want to do something good with their lives. But they're just victims of a war that they have no way of resolving, they are just stuck in a refugee camp so they have no way of fulfilling their dreams."" N'jie says at this year's telethon, she wants to use the experience drawn from this trip to highlight the challenges faced by refugees. ""When you are a refugee you don't always get your education. You are ripped out, you have to leave everything. And that's the same if you are in Colombia, or in Dadaab on the Somalian border, or if you are in Gaza. ""As a young person you need education, you need hope, you need somewhere to go, so the project they have regarding education is something I'd like to talk more about at the telethon this year."" When N'jie is not presenting shows on Norwegian television, she likes to indulge to her other passion -- performing. A talented singer in her own right, she has toured Norway several times both as a solo artist and as a member of Queendom, a comedy group of five like-minded women. ""People really tend to think of Queendom as we are just black Norwegians but we are a very international group. Because one girl is from Norway-Nigeria, one from Trinidad-Norway, one from Uganda, one from Ethiopia and me from Gambia-Norway. ""We make fun of Norwegians and we also make fun of Africans. And there is so much humor in the meeting between the different cultures. So to me it was about telling people about my experience as a black Norwegian woman but in a fun way."" N'jie's musical interests led her to another project -- hosting the latest Eurovision Song Contest. It was an offer, she says, that she just couldn't turn down. ""I love a good challenge, that's it. So when they asked me I couldn't say no. It's the biggest TV show in NRK history. I had to do it. How do you create that kind of show? With three shows, with 18 000 people every time. And it was just a big challenge, I loved every minute of it."" Teo Kermeliotis contributed to this report.","TV presenter Haddy N'jie is an instantly recognizable face in Norway .

"(CNN) -- The first guests checked back into the Taj Mahal Palace and the Oberoi-Trident hotels Sunday, marking the reopening of the two luxury venues damaged by terrorist attacks in Mumbai last month. Guests arrive Sunday at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai. Along with new guests, the hotels' five restaurants were booked with diners, representatives of the Taj Mahal said. ""Today has been an incredibly moving day. The Taj has been reopened, after a massive concerted effort, in dedication to all of those who lost their lives in the attacks on Mumbai,"" said Ratan Tata, the chairman of the company that owns the the Taj Mahal Palace hotel.

The scene Sunday is a far cry from November 26 when the hotel and many other locations in Mumbai were paralyzed by a mass of coordinated attacks. Terrorists using bombs, gunfire and fire caused the deaths of more than 160 people over three days of sieges throughout the city that is India's commercial capital. They took hostages at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels. The assaults also targeted a historic train station, a Jewish cultural center and other landmarks.

NATO warplanes belonging to the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force fired Paveway guided bombs and destroyed two main battle tanks and two armored personnel carriers belonging to Libya's military, said Maj. Gen. John Lorimer, strategic communication officer for the chief of the defense staff. The airstrikes occurred Thursday, he said. NATO reported that government forces were continuing ""to attack the peoples of the western highlands,"" Lorimer said. Meanwhile, rebels claimed to liberate Yefren and the nearby town of Kikla, both of which are about 25 miles east of their stronghold in Zintan, one rebel fighter said. Talhat al-Jiwayli, a rebel on the front lines in Zintan, also said that anti-Gadhafi forces were surrounding the town of al-Rayyana, more than 7 miles northeast of Zintan. Al-Jiwayli added that the situation on the ground was still tense, and the troops of Gadhafi were still firing daily barrages of Grad rockets on Zintan and surrounding villages. In other measures against Gadhafi's forces Thursday, NATO airstrikes hit four surface-to-air missile launchers near Tripoli; a tank, two armored personnel carriers and an ammunition storage facility near Mizdah; more ammunition storage facilities near Hun and Qaryat; two armored fighting vehicles near Sirte; and a command and control node in Brega and nearby radar, according to NATO. The latest NATO strikes occurred two days after the alliance announced its decision to extend its mission in Libya by 90 days, continuing a campaign that began in March. The resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council in March authorized member states ""to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country, including Benghazi, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory.""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra dismissed calls by protesters for her to step down by Tuesday, saying she is open to talks to resolve demonstrations against her government that turned violent over the weekend. Yingluck said in a televised news conference that it would be unconstitutional for her to step down and that the door was open for negotiations. The leader of the anti-government demonstrations, Suthep Thaugsuban, on Sunday urged the democratically elected Yingluck to resign, saying he was giving her two days to ""return power to the people unconditionally."" He made the comments after a face-to-face meeting with the Prime Minister in the presence of military leaders. Suthep, a former deputy prime minister for the opposition Democrat Party, has called for power to be transferred to an unelected ""people's council."" But Yingluck, who survived a no confidence vote in Parliament last week, is refusing to budge despite weeks of protests in the streets of the capital, Bangkok. Monday evening, a Thai court issued an arrest warrant for Suthep on a charge of insurrection. Worst unrest in years . On Saturday, three people were killed and more than 60 wounded in clashes between protesters and Yingluck's supporters -- the worst civil unrest in Thailand since a military crackdown on demonstrations in 2010. On Sunday, police used tear gas to fend off demonstrators trying to force their way into the government headquarters. Many protestors had towels they soaked with water to hold over their mouths and eyes for the gas. Yingluck reiterated Monday that authorities would not use violence against protesters, but police appeared to be resorting to increasingly tough measures to keep demonstrators at bay. Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut said police at government headquarters had used rubber bullets in certain instances. The number of protesters in the area appeared lower than in recent days, but hardcore elements seemed to be among those who remained. Tear gas canisters, rocks and bottles of water were hurled back and forth across the barricades. The government headquarters, known as Government House, are a symbolic target for protesters. Amid the siege, Yingluck has decamped from the seat of government power to the police headquarters, said government spokesman Teerat Rattanasevi. Demonstrators, meanwhile, continued to occupy official buildings they had stormed last week -- the Ministry of Finance and another complex of government offices. But Suthep's call for a civil servants to go on strike appeared not to have taken hold Monday. ""Governmental agencies are all functioning normally,"" said Teerat. ""But of course, some offices that have been taken over by these protesters have to work from their temporary setups."" Thaksin's influence . Protesters say they want to rid Thailand of the influence of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. That's an ambitious goal in a country where parties affiliated with Thaksin, who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland, have won every election since 2001. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006, and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The current protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse Yingluck of being nothing more than Thaksin's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied. The military -- which removed Thaksin amid protests in 2006 -- has remained on the sidelines of the current crisis. Yingluck said Monday that she believes the military is taking a neutral stance. Chaos and commerce . Although the demonstrations have brought chaos to certain pockets of Bangkok and prompted warnings from foreign embassies to avoid protest areas, everyday life has continued in much of the city. Some street traders have even adapted to service protesters needs. On Sunday, many people down the street from the barricades near Government House, just out of reach of the tear gas, were cooking by the side of the road. Others were driving through with pick-up trucks giving food to protestors. One enterprising vendor rode through the protest area selling ice creams in between volleys of tear gas. 10 questions: What's behind the protests in Thailand?

"(CNN) -- The former head of an Air Force sexual assault prevention program was acquitted Wednesday of an assault charge stemming from an incident in Arlington, Virginia, last spring, his lawyer confirmed to CNN. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 42, was arrested in May and accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County, not far from the Pentagon. A police report said the unidentified woman fought off her assailant, who appeared intoxicated. Krusinski was initially charged with sexual battery, but prosecutors later changed that charge to assault and battery, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. ""We are very gratified by the verdict and gratified by the very serious consideration the jury gave to this matter,"" defense attorney Barry Coburn told CNN. ""The system worked, which is always a good thing to see."" Krusinski, a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, was the chief of a branch of the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program at the time of the incident. He was removed from that post after his arrest, which came two days before the Pentagon released a report showing a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of reported sexual assault cases within the military in the fiscal year that ended September 30, 2012. Coburn said it was unclear what the acquittal would mean for Krusinski's Air Force career. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Former chief of Air Force sexual assault prevention program acquitted of groping .

"(CNN) -- Germany announced Sunday it has agreed to lend 100 million euros ($144 million) to the rebels in Libya for ""civilian and humanitarian purposes"" despite staying out of NATO's bombing campaign against Libyan government forces. Germany had previously announced a loan of $10 million (7 million euros) for humanitarian aid to the Transitional National Council, the rebel movement that is battling to unseat longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. ""Because of Colonel Gadhafi's war against his own people, the situation in Libya is very difficult,"" German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement announcing the loan. ""There is a major lack of funds to build infrastructure, as well as a shortage of needed goods, ranging from medical supplies to food."" Germany has not participated in the NATO-led military effort in Libya and abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote that authorized military action to protect civilians from Gadhafi's forces. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in June that her country shares the hope ""that this NATO mission is successful."" Merkel also said Germany was supporting the NATO mission by providing increased resources to the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan, freeing other nations to contribute to the Libyan campaign. Germany has recognized the rebels as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people and established a liaison office with the opposition in Benghazi in May. Berlin indicated Sunday that the loan will eventually be repaid by the Transitional National Council, using frozen assets from the Gadhafi regime. The statement indicated the reimbursement would happen ""when the U.N. Security Council unfreezes the assets for a legitimate Libyan government."" By agreeing to the loan, Germany added itself to a growing number of nations, including Turkey and Qatar, that have announced plans to hand over millions of dollars in frozen Gadhafi assets to the rebel council in Benghazi. In an interview with CNN last week, the finance minister for the internationally isolated Libyan government in Tripoli warned that the proposed reallocation of frozen funds would violate international law. ""The international monetary system cannot withstand action in this manner,"" said Abdulhafid Zlitni. ""If you are freezing, through United Nations Security Council action, funds for any country, then you can't confiscate it. There are legal obligations of the banks."" Also on Sunday, rebel forces fought to hold on to Qawalish, a key Libyan village along a major north-south route. Rebel fighter Talha Jwaili told CNN that Gadhafi forces advanced from nearby Al-Asaba using heavy machinery. The rebels called in a large rebel force from Zintan, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) away, and ""managed to repel the Gadhafi forces after a fierce fight that lasted almost four hours,"" Jwaili said. One person died in the fighting, Jwaili said -- his 16-year-old cousin, Youssef Jwaili, son of the Zintan military commander.  Several others were injured, Jwaili said. State TV, meanwhile, offered a different version of events. It reported ""armed gangs and the colonialist crusader alliance"" attacked a march of Libyan tribes at the entrance of Qawalish. It broadcast video of a convoy of civilian vehicles with passengers waving green government flags. It also showed video of people being treated at a hospital. In a speech last week, Gadhafi called on his supporters to march -- unarmed -- to reclaim rebel-controlled cities and towns. ""A million should march to Benghazi and liberate it from the traitors without any weapons,"" the strongman said. ""Even without weapons, we can cleanse the western mountains by the march of men and women."" CNN's Ivan Watson in Tripoli, Kareem Khadder in Tunisia and Frederik Pleitgen in Cairo contributed to this report.","NEW: Rebel forces fight to hold on to village of Qawalish .

"(WIRED) -- Last month, when Zack Ajmal was planning a vacation to Italy, he set out to find the first thing that a traveler would need in a foreign land: a map. But digital maps of Rome and Venice for his Garmin GPS device cost almost $100. So instead, Ajmal turned to OpenStreet Map, a community-driven maps database. A user-edited map of cycling routes in Perth, Australia, available on OpenStreetMap's site. ""It worked out pretty well,"" the Atlanta-based engineer says. ""I found Open MTB, which had outdoor hiking and cycling maps with not just roads information, but also trails, short cuts and little known routes."" Ajmal is among roughly half a million users who are eschewing proprietary maps information from GPS companies and instead going with crowdsourced versions, which they then load onto their GPS devices and smartphones. The key to these map hacks is OpenStreetMap. Founded in 2004, OSM is to maps what Wikipedia is to encyclopedias. The site offers maps that can be edited, customized and loaded on to devices for free. Want to go whitewater rafting but need to know where the rapids are? There's a map for that. Or to know all the interesting points along the river Nile? There's a map for that. And it's all based on the OpenStreetMap data. ""The value is that it is a richer map with more up-to-date information because anyone can fix things,"" says Steve Coast, one of the founders of OpenStreetMap. ""Users get access to the underlying data and not just a picture of the maps."" Consumer map data is currently a duopoly split between two mapping providers: Nokia's Navteq and TomTom's Tele Atlas. The two provide the mapping data that powers almost all commercial map applications and devices. But maps from these providers are extremely restrictive in how they can be used. Want a map of the best hiking trails in the country or a walking tour of Rome? Traditional GPS services can't offer that. For adventurous geeks that calls for a DIY fix. ""OSM maps are a little new on the scene,"" says Rich Owings, who runs the GPStracklog.com website and is the author of the book GPS Mapping. ""Most people in the U.S. were not using them until recently, but now there are iPhone apps based on it."" Getting OpenStreetMap is easier on some devices than others. In Garmin systems, it's as simple as taking one of the available maps and dropping it into a folder on the device. ""It's really hard to mess up your GPS doing this,"" says Owings. ""And if you have questions you can always ask the community to help you out."" Owings says he loaded maps of Ecuador on his Garmin unit in about 30 minutes. ""It's not as clean of a map as one you can get from the Garmin store but they are pretty wonderful and have very good coverage."" For TomTom systems, getting OpenStreetMap can be a more difficult process. TomTom uses a proprietary mapping format, says Coast. That means a tricky process of converting OpenStreetMap into a TomTom-compatible format. OpenStreetMap has also been used to create iPhone apps such as MotionX, which is targeted at hikers, skiers and bikers; B.iCycle, a cyclometer that shows burned calories, trip distance and trails; and ATM@UK, which shows all ATM locations in Great Britain. The OpenStreetMap project is a cartographer's dream come true, says Randal Hale, who has a GIS consulting business. Hale has created custom maps for a few clients using OpenStreetMap and has put OSM-generated maps on his Garmin unit. ""With the professional mapping software, I have to purchase a license to use their version, which is expensive and I can't use the data for analysis,"" says Hale. ""With OpenStreetMap, I download it, make cartographic edits and hopefully I have made it better for the next user."" Meanwhile, traditional navigation companies are also reaching out to users for help on data. For instance, Nokia kicked off a pilot project at the University of California at Berkeley to collect traffic information through GPS-enabled cellphones. Users could download the software for free and use it to check on road conditions on their phones. At the same time, the software would report data about its users' positions to a central database, enabling the researchers to assemble traffic data in real time. Google has also said it will add nationwide real-time traffic data to its maps by collecting anonymous location data from Google Maps users. Still, community-created maps and navigation information remains a small niche, appealing only to ""GPS techies"" who are willing to take risks, says Owings. ""There's not a lot of public awareness because many people don't even know they can do this with their Garmin or cellphone,"" he says. But if you are planning to go to Berlin later this year, take a look at the OpenStreetMap site. Germany is expected to become the first country in the site's database to be fully mapped by contributors. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- First Serena Williams, now Maria Sharapova. Another day at the Australian Open, another top female star out of the season's first grand slam. One day after world No. 1 Williams was dumped out in Melbourne, third seed Sharapova followed suit as she surrendered a one-set lead against Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova to lose 3-6 6-4 6-1. It was the second time 20th seed Cibulkova has beaten the Russian at a grand slam and Sharapova, who required treatment on a hip injury between the second and third sets, admitted her performances in Melbourne have not been good enough. ""I haven't been playing the best tennis of this tournament, but I found ways to get through to the last two matches,"" Sharapova, a winner of this tournament in 2008, told reporters. ""Tried to do that again today, but she played extremely well."" Sharapova, a four-time grand slam winner, refused to blame the injury for her surprise defeat. ""I don't think it's rocket science,"" added the 26-year-old. ""Just when you play a lot of tennis, you're going to get these types of aches and pains and certain movements that you feel it on."" Cibulkova's reward for reaching the last eight at Melbourne Park for the first time in her career is a match against 11th seed Simona Halep, who also eliminated a top 10 player in world No. 8 Jelena Jankovic. Sharapova's loss means double defending champion Victoria Azarenka is now the red hot favorite to win a third consecutive Australian Open title. Azarenka's cause will be helped by cooler temperatures, with players finally granted respite from last week's scorching heat. The world No. 2 is the only former champion left in the women's draw after she confidently dispatched American rising star Sloane Stephens 6-3 6-2. Although her chief rivals for the title have been eliminated, Azarenka is taking nothing for granted ahead of a meeting with fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska. ""The players who beat those players deserve all the credit because they've been better, so they are dangerous and they are competitive,"" said Belarus' Azarenka. ""For me it's important to just, you know, keep focusing on my game and play it one at a time. Quarterfinals of a grand slam is never easy, no matter who you play."" While the women's draw is turning out unexpected results, the men's half is proving altogether more predictable. World No. 1 Rafael Nadal registered a straight-sets win over Japan's Kei Nishikori which was far more difficult than the scoreline would suggest. The 13-time grand slam champion had his serve broken four times and he was made to sweat by 16th seed Nishikori before wrapping up a 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 7-6 (7-3) win. Nadal will continue his bid for a second career win at the season-opening grand slam against Bulgarian No. 22 Gregor Dimitrov. Three-time finalist Andy Murray didn't have it all his own way during his round of 16 victory over Frenchman Stephane Robert. The world No. 4 looked unflappable as he raced into a 6-1 6-2 lead, but Robert, ranked 119th, rallied to take a third set tie break. Eventually Murray's class told and the Scot secured a 6-1 6-2 6-7 (6-8) 6-2 win, with 17-time grand slam winner Roger Federer awaiting in the quarterfinals. Sixth seed Federer looked in ominous form as he swept aside No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3 7-5 6-4, showing glimpses of the talent which brought him four Australian Open titles between 2004 and 2010.
