"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . Treasurer Joe Hockey used his own wealthy electorate of North Sydney as an example as to why it was important to introduce a $7 co-payment for visits to the doctor. After the Federal Government's Budget in May, Mr Hockey said: 'I want to emphasise my electorate of North Sydney has one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia and I have one of the wealthiest electorates in Australia'. 'To me there is something wrong with that.' But it turns out Mr Hockey's figures were way off the mark. His wealthy electorate on Sydney's North Shore is actually in the bottom 20 per cent of bulk-billers, which is the term used to describe visits to the doctor or hospital paid for by the taxpayer-funded Medicare. Scroll down for video . Joe Hockey defended the $7 GP co-payment by claiming 'I want to emphasise my electorate of North Sydney has one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia'. New figures supplied to a Senate Committee from the Department of Human Services suggest it's quite the opposite . The latest Department of Human Services figures available (from 2013) show that bulk-billing rates in Mr Hockey's electorate are  126th out of 150. This same information was provided to a Federal Government Senate Committee on bulk-billing rates around the country. Bulk-billed: The table (above) shows that Mr Hockey's electorate is actually 126th out of 150 electorates, not as the Treasurer claimed 'one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia' As the table shows, the areas with a high percentage of bulk-billing are in the lower socio-economic areas of Sydney's western and south-western suburbs. Most of those electorates are Labor-held seats. Just one, Lindsay in outer western Sydney, is held by the Coalition. Mr Hockey's North Sydney electorate ranks 126 out of 150. Labor's Shadow Minister for Health, Catherine King said: 'Joe Hockey is completely out of touch on the health needs of Australians'. Shadow Health Minister Catherine King says 'the GP Tax hits everyone but it particularly hits low and middle income earners and those with poor health and they tend to live in some of our poorer suburbs' 'Contrary to the Treasurer’s claim, his electorate does not have one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia, it has one of the lowest,' Ms King said. 'The GP Tax hits everyone but it particularly hits low and middle income earners and those with poor health and they tend to live in some of our poorer suburbs, mostly in the outer suburbs and regional and rural communities. The very people Joe Hockey thinks also won’t pay his petrol tax because they don’t drive.' 'Scrapping bulk-billing and hitting low and middle income Australians, poor, pensioners, children and the chronically ill.' In Ed Husic's area of Chifley in western Sydney, 99 per cent of doctors' visits were bulk-billed. The figures show of 1,457,609 patient visits, 1,444,598 were not charged. The next four areas are all  Labor-held seats in Western Sydney, where just about every visit to the GP was paid for by bulk-billing. This in contrast to Mr Hockey's electorate, where only 72 per cent of GP visits were bulk-billed. Ms King said that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners told a recent Senate Out of Pocket Health expenses inquiry ‘there is good evidence to suggest that there is a negative economic impact with patients using more expensive health care through the hospital system that could be delivered by general practice at a fraction of the cost’. Health Minister Peter Dutton has fired another salvo at Senators planning to block the bill, suggesting it will lead to a smaller Medical Research Future fund. Health Minister Peter Dutton is warning any scrapping of the co-payment will damage the plans for a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund . Medicare was established in 1984 replacing the old Medibank system, which had its beginnings in 1975 under the Whitlam Labor Government . 'The medical research future fund without the co-payment will be much smaller, no doubt about that,' he said. The government claims that $5 of the $7 co-payment will be put towards the establishing of a $20 billion fund. 'If the co-payment falls over, then that is going to be a big blow to the medical research fund.' The Treasurer, though, is coming under fire from all angles, including internally. After being cut loose by senior Cabinet ministers, including the PM, over his 'poor people don't drive' claim, there are revelations today that he also had to be pulled into line by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in a party room meeting. The altercation stemming from a verbal assault Joe Hockey reportedly launched against WA Liberal Premier Colin Barnett over GST revenue.","Treasurer Joe Hockey said 'my electorate of North Sydney has one of the highest bulk-billing rates in Australia and I have one of the wealthiest electorates in Australia'

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A diet laden with burgers and fries, dripping with sweet treats and saturated in pies could kill our appetite for healthy foods, scientists warn. A new Australian study has found living on junk food not only makes rats fat, but also suppresses their desires to eat a balanced diet. Scientists believe their findings help explain how excessive consumption of unhealthy foods, can change a person's behaviour, weaken their self-control and lead to overeating and obesity. Scroll down for video . A new study, undertaken at the University of New South Wales in Australia, has found living on junk food not only makes rats fat, but also suppresses their desire to eat a balanced diet . Scientists believe their findings help explain how excessive consumption of unhealthy foods, can change a person's behaviour, weaken their self-control and lead to overeating and obesity . Professor Margaret Morris, from the University of New South Wales, said: 'The interesting thing about this finding is that if the same thing happens in humans, eating junk food may change our responses to signals associated with food rewards. 'It's like you've just had ice cream for lunch, yet you still go and eat more when you hear the ice cream van come by.' The team of researchers taught young male rats to associate each of two different sound cues with a particular flavour of sugar water, cherry and grape. Rats raised on a healthy diet stopped responding to cues linked to a flavour, in which they had recently overindulged. This inborn mechanism, widespread in animals, protects against overeating and helps promote a healthy, balanced diet. But after two weeks eating a daily diet rich with cafeteria foods, including pie, dumplings, cookies and cake - with 150 per cent more calories - the rats' weight increased by 10 per cent. At the same time, researchers noted their behaviour had also changed dramatically. They became indifferent in their food choices and no longer avoided the sound advertising the over-familiar taste. The team of researchers deduced this indicated they had lost their natural preference for healthy foods. They noted the change lasted for some time after the rats returned to a healthy diet. Professor Margaret Morris said: 'The interesting thing about this finding is that if the same thing happens in humans, eating junk food may change our responses to signals associated with food rewards' The team concluded a diet of junk food causes lasting changes in the reward circuit parts of the rats' brain, including the orbitofrontal cortex - an area of the brain responsible for decision-making. They said the findings may have implications for people's ability to limit their intake of certain kinds of foods, because the brain's reward ciruits are similar in all mammals. The World Health Organisation has estimated that more than 10 per cent of the world's adult population is obese. WHO said at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese - which are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Dr Amy Reichelt, lead author of the paper, said: 'As the global obesity epidemic intensifies, advertisements may have a greater effect on people who are overweight and make snacks like chocolate bars harder to resist.' The findings were reported in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.","Australian study found living on junk food makes rats fat-  but also suppresses their desire to eat a healthy diet .

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . Children belonging to our earlier ancestors did not develop as quickly as modern humans, researchers have found. Researchers studied the Taung Child, a 3.3 million year old skull discovered 90 years ago in South Africa. They found the Taung Child, known as Australopithecus africanus, was not like an ordinary toddler of today - it didn't experience a spurt in brain growth in its first few months, as modern babies do, making it less human-like than previously thought. The first reconstruction of the Taung Child, a 3.3 million year old human ancestor, found it didn't experience a spurt in brain growth in its first few months, as modern babies do, making it less human-like than previously thought. Found in South Africa 90 years ago, the roughly 3 million-year-old fossil is thought to have belonged to a 3 to 4-year-old. The Taung Child has historical and scientific importance in the fossil record as the first and best example of early hominin brain evolution. When this 3-year-old child's skull was found in 1924, it was among the first early human fossils to be found in Africa -- and the first early human fossil discovery to draw major attention to this region as a place of origin of the human family tree . Their findings disprove the idea that this early hominin shows infant brain development in the prefrontal region similar to that of modern humans. The Taung Child has historical and scientific importance in the fossil record as the first and best example of early hominin brain evolution, and theories have been put forward that it exhibits key cranial adaptations found in modern human infants and toddlers. By subjecting the skull of the first australopith discovered to ta CT scanner, researchers are now casting doubt on theories that Australopithecus africanus shows the same cranial adaptations found in modern human infants and toddlers. It is the first time that such a high-resolution scan has been taken of the fossil. This disproves current support for the idea that this early hominin shows infant brain development in the prefrontal region similar to that of modern humans. Killed by an eagle? The Taung Child's skull . Found in south Africa, the roughly 3 million-year-old fossil is thought to have belonged to a 3 to 4-year-old. The Taung Child has historical and scientific importance in the fossil record as the first and best example of early hominin brain evolution. When this 3-year-old child's skull was found in 1924, it was among the first early human fossils to be found in Africa - and the first early human fossil discovery to draw major attention to this region as a place of origin of the human family tree. The Taung Child’s first molars had only just begun to erupt through the gum and become visible as teeth, indicating that the fossilized jaw belongs to a child. Closer analysis of dental development, crown formation, and root length has estimated the child’s age at death at 3.3 years. The Taung Child is thought have been attacked and killed by an eagle. Scientists suspect an eagle killed the Taung Child because puncture marks were found at the bottom of the 3-year-old’s eye sockets . To test the ancientness of this evolutionary adaptation, Dr Kristian J. Carlson at the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand, and colleagues performed a virtual dissection of the skull. 'A recent study has described the roughly 3 million-year-old fossil, thought to have belonged to a 3 to 4-year-old, as having a persistent metopic suture and open anterior fontanelle, two features that facilitate post-natal brain growth in human infants when their disappearance is delayed,' said Carlson. Dr. Kristian Carlson in the Microfocus X-ray Computed Tomography facility at Wits University with the skull . 'Results of the new study show that there is still no evidence for this kind of skull adaptation that evolved before Homo, nor is there evidence for a link between such skull characteristics and the proposed accompanying early prefrontal lobe expansion,' Carlson said.","Researchers studied the Taung Child, a 3.3 million year old skull discovered 90 years ago in South Africa .

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . Medicinal marijuana continues to be a contentious debate, but now a compound found in Marijuana could soon be tested on young Australians to prevent and treat psychosis . European researchers have suggested it could treat schizophrenia and be much more effective than other drugs by having fewer side effects. It comes as pressure continues to mount on state and federal governments in Australia to legalise the drug for medicinal purposes. Indian hemp / Cannabis plant (pictured) growing on plantation for medicinal purposes or as drug.  A compound in this plant could soon be tested on young Australians to prevent and treat psychosis and schizophrenia . A plastic bag of skunk cannabis. Will marijuana be able to treat and prevent pyschosis and schizophrenia? Leading psychiatrist and mental health advocate Patrick McGorry told The Age, that one part of the drug was showing promise as an anti-psychotic medicine. Australian of the Year, Professor Patrick McGorry (pictured) says one part of marijuana is showing promise as an anti-psychotic medicine . The director of Orygen Youth Health Research Centre and 2010 Australian of the year said while tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in cannabis was widely thought to be dangerous and increase the risk of psychosis in about 10 per cent to 20 per cent of people, another component - cannabidiol (CBD) - appeared to relieve psychosis, depression and anxiety. McGorry's team are hoping to trial pharmaceutical CBD in young people showing signs of early psychosis to see how it compared to other antipsychotic medications, which often cause undesirable side effects. 'There's been a lot more concern in recent times about antipsychotic medication. Obviously it's really effective, but the longer term side effects are worrying people, especially weight gain and metabolic problems,' Professor McGorry told The Age. 'People are willing to try more experimental treatments that have got some promise and cannabidiol is definitely one of those.' There's hope to commence a new trial soon with an application already in for government funding. McGorry does believe the plant possesses both bad and good qualities, saying they should not be confused. 'We're definitely not saying smoke dope to treat psychosis,' he said. He suggests if a trial were to be set up it would only involve the compound CBD. Cannabis expert, Jan Copeland has given her support to more studies of CBD being used for people with early stage psychosis. Marijuana cannabis plant leaves Annapurna Region Nepal. A compound found in Marijuana could soon be tested on young Australians to prevent and treat psychosis . Cannabis expert Jan Copeland (pictured) has given her support to more studies of CBD being used for people with early stage psychosis . The director of the University of NSW's National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre described CBD as a 'very interesting part of the complex cannabis chemistry' that does not get people stoned, but rather appears to balance the effects of THC, which makes some people anxious. She also told The Age, 'there was a small, but growing number of studies suggesting CBD relieved psychosis, anxiety and insomnia, and that her team was trialling it in about 10 people withdrawing from cannabis use to see if it helped them through the process.' But the search for CBD in street cannabis hasn't been encouraged. 'It has high levels of THC, around 15 per cent now, but almost no CBD, so it's definitely not the same thing as smoking cannabis,' she said. In July, market researchers, Reach tel, conducted a survey of more than 3,000 Australia's asking them the question : Do you support the legislation of cannabis for medicinal purposes? The majority would support the move at 65.9 percent, 14.4 percent said they would oppose the legislation and 19.7 percent were undecided on the issue.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . It's been 30 years since Annie Potts played Janine Melnitz in Ghostbusters, but the 61-year-old actress has a good idea of where her sassy character might be today. According to Ms Potts, Janine - a secretary for the Ghostbusters - would have given up on fighting ghosts, and would probably now be running a pest control company instead. 'You know, snakes, squirrels, racoons... trying to get little bats out of the attic,' the mother-of-three, now a drama professor, tells Vanity Fair as part of its Improv Imagination series. Classic: 30 years ago, Annie Potts, 61, (right), played spirited secretary Janine Melnitz (right) in Ghostbusters, and has now shared her theory as to what the fictional character might be doing if she were around today . Ms Potts, who sports almost the same cropped red hairstyle today as she did in the 1984 blockbuster, lets her imagination run wild as she reels off modern-day predictions for her fictional character. Janine is described as living in the Jersey Shore, owning 17 cats, frequenting cruise ships and singing Cyndi Lauper covers. Her hobbies, Ms Potts suggests, might include taking a metal detector to the beach in search of lost Rolex's and rings, and her vacations would involve 'touring the national monuments.' Old school: Janine (pictured in Ghostbusters) is imagined by Ms Potts as living in the Jersey Shore, owning 17 cats, running a pest control company, and singing Cyndi Lauper covers . All grown up: Since her Ghostbusters years, the Nashville-born actress (pictured) has enjoyed minor roles in Law & Order, Ugly Betty and Two and a Half Men. She is now married to producer James Hayman . When asked whether she thinks Janine stayed with her love interest - nerdy bespectacled scientist Egon Spengle - she emphatically responds: 'Oh I always hoped.' She suggests Egon would today be teaching at Princeton University and that if the couple had had kids, it probably wouldn't have been smooth sailing. Bob: Janine's character (pictured) in Ghostbusters II . By way of example, she refers to a scene in the Ghostbusters sequel movie; in which Janine and Egon are looking after a baby who manages to get onto the roof without them noticing. 'She wasn't a very good babysitter,' Ms Potts remarks. 'I'm guessing she didn't turn out to be a very good mother.' She then goes on to predict that Janine's children would still be living at home aged '30-plus,' wasting their lives playing video games. Since her Ghostbusters years, the Nashville, Tennessee-born actress has enjoyed minor roles in Law & Order, Ugly Betty and Two and a Half Men, among others. She was also the voice of Toy Story's Little Bo Peep, and has appeared in musicals and on Broadway. These days, she is a visiting professor at Stephens College, Missouri. Ms Potts been divorced three times, but has been married to her fourth husband, TV producer James Hayman, since 1900.

Daniel Ken Holtzclaw, 27, was arrested Thursday on complaints of rape, forcible oral sodomy, sexual battery and indecent exposure . An Oklahoma City police officer was arrested Thursday and is being held in lieu of $5 million bond after being accused of committing a series of sexual assaults against at least six women while on duty. Daniel Ken Holtzclaw, 27, faces complaints of rape, forcible oral sodomy, sexual battery and indecent exposure, The Oklahoman reported. Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty said at a news conference that Holtzclaw stopped women while he was working and forced them to expose themselves, fondled them and in at least one instance had intercourse with a woman. Authorities have statements from six victims and expect a statement from a seventh, Citty said. All are black women between the ages of 34 and 58. Citty also said investigators believe there are additional victims. The department began investigating Holtzclaw after a woman complained to police June 18, the chief said. Holtzclaw, who worked the 4pm to 2am shift at the Springlake Division which predominately patrols the northeast part of Oklahoma City, was placed on leave that day. 'We started the investigation and we started looking at traffic stops he had made throughout the previous months to try to identify and initiate contact with females that we knew he had stopped during that period of time . . . to see if they had been sexually assaulted,' Citty said. Records indicate Holtzclaw is in custody at the Oklahoma County Jail. The records don't list an attorney, and jail staff said they could not provide attorney information. Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, who also attended the news conference, said he anticipates charges against Holtzclaw will be filed by August 29. A first-degree rape charge can carry a sentence of five years to life or life without parole.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Footprints made by dinosaurs 200 million years ago have been vandalised by amateur fossil hunters. The tracks were among the best examples anywhere in the world and their precise location has largely remained a secret. But blundering fossil hunters have damaged the footprints by filling one with plaster of Paris and hammering it in a bid to remove their plaster cast. Scroll down for video . Footprints made by dinosaurs 200 million years ago (pictured) have been vandalised by amateur fossil hunters.They filled some with plaster of Paris and tried to smash it out with a breezeblock . They also lit fires on the rock shelf where the tracks have laid undisturbed since Jurassic times. An investigation has been launched to assess the damage and track down the culprits. Archaeologist Karl-James Langford, who is the founder of Archaeology Cymru said: ‘I was horrified - these are some of the earliest dinosaur prints ever discovered. ‘They have been there for 200 million years but have been seriously damaged. ‘One print had been filled with Plaster of Paris and somebody had deliberately tried to smash it out with a breeze block. The footprints are believed to have been left by three-toed meat eating theropod dinosaurs, which walked on their hind legs. Experts have called for areas of special scientific interest to be protected from members of the public, between Barry and Sully (pictured) on the South Wales coast . The footprints were made 200 million years ago. It is thought they were left by three-toed meat eating theropod dinosaurs, which walked on their hind legs. Some wider four-toed footprints are believed to belong to a plant eating dinosaur which would have walked on all fours. Amateur fossil-hunters damaged the footprints by filling some with plaster of Paris and trying to smash it out with a breezeblock. They also lit fires on the rock shelf where the tracks have laid undisturbed since Jurassic times. ‘Fires are also being started at the site, and rubbish left around. The public must be stopped going to the site now, before it is too late.’ Mr Langford discovered the damage while taking a party of 10 students to the site at Bendrick Rock, between Barry and Sully, on the South Wales coast. The footprints are believed to have been left by three-toed meat-eating theropod dinosaurs, that walked on their hind legs. Some wider four-toed footprints are believed to belong to a plant eating dinosaur which would have walked on all fours. The footprints were made by some of the earliest dinosaurs in the world and it is possible that ancestoral crocodile-like replies walked among them. At the time, the site lay in the arid north belt of the equator and South Wales was a hot desert. Deposits from flash floods, including rounded limestone pebbles within the sandstone beds can still be seen at the site, revealing its turbulent past weather. The rock ledge has been made a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is of ‘worldwide importance’ because of the dinosaur tracks. Experts from the National Museum of Wales, the Geologists’ Association South Wales Group and the British Institute for Geological Conservation are investigating. There have been problems at the site before. In 2005, experts discovered that a large area of thefootprint site had been dug up and removed illegally. Slabs of rock with one or two footprints on them began to appear for sale on the internet and at fossil shops and fairs in the UK and the U.S. Many were recovered and one man was cautioned, according to the Geologists' Association South Wales Group.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Arthritis patients in the UK are risking their health by taking too many painkillers, scientists have warned. A new study found almost one in five sufferers are taking two anti-inflammatories to manage their condition, putting themselves at risk of side effects including gastric bleeds, heart attack and stroke. The research found 97 per cent of patients with osteoarthritis had restricted movement - and more than seven out of 10 had reduced mobility, with some almost unable to move at all. Those afflicted by the condition struggle with everyday activities including walking, climbing the stairs and taking part in sports . Research by Arthritis UK, Pro Bono Bio and Lloyds Pharmacy, has found one in five osteoarthritis sufferers are taking two different anti-inflammatories, putting themselves at risk of gastric bleed, stroke and heart attacks . The study, carried out by Arthritis UK, Lloyds Pharmacy and nanotechnology firm Pro Bono Bio,  revealed 90 per cent of respondents were taking drug-based medicines. And three-quarters used more than one treatment to manage their condition. Yet almost half of those with OA complained of side effects, as a result of their medication, with almost nine in 10 worried about the complications. Osteoarthritis affects nearly nine million people in Britain and costs the NHS £5.2 billion-a-year in direct healthcare costs, according to the charity Arthritis Research UK. Dr Liam O'Toole, CEO of Arthritis Research UK, said: 'The findings of this survey highlight the debilitating pain that the one in six people with arthritis in the UK are facing every day. 'Pain is one of the main symptoms of arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions. For some people, the pain is long-lasting and interferes with their daily life, stopping them doing the things they enjoy. 'All of our work is focused on taking the pain away from people who have arthritis so that they remain active, doing the things that they love. The aim of the research was to better understand the impact the condition has on patients' lives, and help determine the use of those treatments currently available. It found doctors and patients struggle to control the pain and stiffness caused by OA, a disease for which there is currently no cure. In total 440 people with the condition, took part in the study over a four-month period from January to May this year. Osteoarthritis affects around nine million people across the UK. Of those surveyed with OA, 57 per cent were taking a pain pill, including aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac. Pictured are X-rays of an arthritic knee and ankle . Of those surveyed, 61 per cent had officially been diagnosed with OA. They ranged in age from 20 to 90 years, with the majority in the over-50s bracket. Almost nine out of 10 were female and the knee was the most affected joint. Of those with OA, 57 per cent were taking a pain pill from the class of medication known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or NSAIDs. These include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib and diclofenac - some are prescribed, others can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets. The report states: 'This class of medicine is well known to cause side effects, especially in patients who have risk factors. 'These risk factors include being elderly, having conditions such as high blood pressure, having ulcers, having had a previous heart attack or taking certain other medications. 'Extremely worrying is the significant number of patients (19 per cent) who report that they are taking two oral NSAIDs at the same time.' One osteoarthritis patient who took part in the survey, Pat Fuller, 73, of Tyne and Wear, said: 'I have arthritis all over my body, but it's worst in my knees. I couldn't walk and I couldn't sleep from the pain. 'It looked like I'd have to either have knee replacements or cease to live on my own, and I didn't want to go down the route of operations. 'Five years ago I had a triple bypass and I don't recover very well from operations, so I really didn't want to have the knees done, but now, because I'm using the new gel, I don't have to. 'I can now keep the pain away and have my mobility back — and I'm enjoying a proper night's sleep.' Ninety per cent of respondents showed interest in a new drug-free treatment, proven to be effective against pain and stiffness, but has none of the side-effects of NSAIDs. The treatment, Flexiseq, was launched by Arthritis Research UK in December. Dr John Dickson, GP and a co-founder of the Primary Care Rheumatology Society, said: 'I read with interest the findings of this survey as they clearly reflect my experience that many patients continue to live with terrible pain and stiffness, despite trying many available treatments. 'These patients are looking for new options, and the new treatment, Flexiseq, may well be the answer for many of them. 'Flexiseq is a drug-free gel, gives comparable pain relief to the oral NSAIDs and has an excellent safety profile. 'I am recommending it to my patients, and use it myself on the painful arthritic joints in my hands.' Michael Earl, of Flexiseq manufacturers Pro Bono Bio, said: 'This survey demonstrates the real need that patients and doctors have for effective and safer treatment options. 'Flexiseq, which is drug-free and has been shown to be as effective as a leading pain tablet, celecoxib, is already being used by many patients and we are delighted by the positive feedback we are getting from these users and from healthcare professionals.' Nitin Makadia, pharmacist and pain expert at LloydsPharmacy, said: 'The results of the survey show a greater need for support and information around medicine management for those living with osteoarthritis. 'At LloydsPharmacy we have taken our support for these patients one step further by offering a pain service that gives patients the opportunity to discuss their pain concerns and get advice from a pharmacist about how they can manage their pain, not just with medication but also through lifestyle changes.'","New study found one in five osteoarthritis sufferers is taking two types of anti-inflammatory painkiller increasing their risk of side effects .

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . A South African fish has given scientists a glimpse of exactly how our ancestors took their first steps on land. Researchers have struggled to understand how ancient fish used their bodies and fins in a terrestrial environment about 400 million years ago. Now, they say the living fish, called Polypterus, show how a group of fish began exploring land and evolved into tetrapods – today's amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Scroll down for video . Polypterus is an African fish that can breathe air, 'walk' on land, and looks much like those ancient fishes that evolved into tetrapods. The team of researchers raised juvenile Polypterus on land for nearly a year, with an aim to revealing how these 'terrestrialized' fish looked and moved differently. The terrestrialized fish walked more effectively by placing their fins closer to their bodies, lifted their heads higher, and kept their fins from slipping as much as fish that were raised in water. But just how these ancient fish used their fishy bodies and fins in a terrestrial environment and what evolutionary processes were at play remain scientific mysteries. Researchers at McGill University published in the journal Nature, turned to a living fish, called Polypterus, to help show what might have happened when fish first attempted to walk out of the water.

'Stressful environmental conditions can often reveal otherwise cryptic anatomical and behavioural variation, a form of developmental plasticity', says Emily Standen, a former McGill post-doctoral student who led the project, now at the University of Ottawa.

'Anatomically, their pectoral skeleton changed to became more elongate with stronger attachments across their chest, possibly to increase support during walking, and a reduced contact with the skull to potentially allow greater head/neck motion,' says Trina Du, a McGill Ph.D. student and study collaborator. Polypterus reveals how a group of fish began exploring land and evolved into tetrapods – today's amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. 'Because many of the anatomical changes mirror the fossil record, we can hypothesize that the behavioural changes we see also reflect what may have occurred when fossil fish first walked with their fins on land', says Hans Larsson, Canada Research Chair in Macroevolution at McGill and an Associate Professor at the Redpath Museum. The terrestrialized Polypterus experiment is unique and provides new ideas for how fossil fishes may have used their fins in a terrestrial environment and what evolutionary processes were at play. Larsson adds, 'This is the first example we know of that demonstrates developmental plasticity may have facilitated a large-scale evolutionary transition, by first accessing new anatomies and behaviours that could later be genetically fixed by natural selection'.","Polypterus is an African fish that can breathe air and 'walk' on land .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . and Lydia Warren for MailOnline . The widow of one of the Boston bombers has remarried and has a baby with her new husband, one of her relatives has claimed in a report. Katherine Russell, 25, was married to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older of the two brothers suspected of detonating two bombs at the Boston Marathon last year. He was later killed in a shootout with police. Now, little more than a year since his death, it has been claimed that she left her parents' home in Rhode Island and traveled 100 miles to New Jersey to be with Tsarnaev's  sisters, Bella and Aliana. At the weekend, she was seen leaving the home with a baby in her arms - and Aliana, speaking to the New York Post, claimed that the child was Russell's. Scroll down for video . Widow: Katherine Russell, 25, is pictured on the porch of the North Bergen, New Jersey home where her late husband's sisters live. In a report, they claimed she has now re-married and had another child, pictured . 'Yes, she got married [again] and had a baby,' Aliana Tsarnaeva told the Post. MailOnline's calls to Russell's attorney have not been returned. The women were found by the news station WCVB last week living in a nondescript blue house in the New Jersey township of 58,000 located about 10 miles west of Manhattan. More than a year after suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed by police in the aftermath of the deadly attack, his widow moved in with his family in New Jersey. She was seen arriving home clad in a loose black frock, with a traditional Muslim headscarf tightly wrapped around her head and a pair of large sunglasses obscuring her face. Swept off her feet: Katherine (left) grew up Christian in Rhode Island, but in 2010 she met Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right) and converted to Islam before marrying him. He was killed following the bombings last year . New home: The Tsarnaevs, Russell and her young daughter have settled in this blue house in the town of 58,000 located about 10 miles west of Manhattan, earlier reports said . Daily routine: Bella Tsarnaev (left) and Katherine (right) are seen chatting in a North Bergen Laundromat . She refused to answer any questions about her late husband or brother-in-law, 20-year-old Dzhokhar, who is currently awaiting federal trial for his role in the April 15, 2013, bombing that killed three people and left 260 others wounded. The two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia were accused of planting two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line. Tamerlan was killed in a getaway attempt after a gun battle with police. Dzhokhar, who was captured hiding in a tarp-covered boat outside a house in a Boston suburb and is hospitalized, was later charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor. In 2010, the promising young artist and good student dropped out of college, converted to Islam and married Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom she met at a nightclub. The couple had a daughter. Extended family: Russell, far left, is seen here with her sister-in-law Bella, center, and her mother-in-law, right . Waiting trial: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, who is set to go on trial for his role in the deadly attack, is pictured with his sister Bella, who has remained in contact with his brother's widow . The young family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they settled in a cramped apartment and attended prayers in a Boston Islamic center. A few weeks after the bombing, Russell’s attorney Amato DeLuca claimed his client learned that her husband was suspected of being a terrorist from news reports on TV. DeLuca said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband of anything and was focused on supporting her family, working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home health care aide. Katherine Russell has largely avoided the public eye since the bombing. Her attorney told WCVB that while Russell's parents and sisters testified before a grand jury, she was never called to speak. The Tsarnaev sisters, have had legal problems of their own in recent years. Ailina is expected to go on trial next month on charges of misleading police in a counterfeit money probe, while Bella stands accused of marijuana possession with intent to distribute. Both women have visited their younger brother in jail. Dzhokhar is set to face trial in November.","Katherine Russell, 25, has remarried and had a baby with her new husband, her late husband's sister Aliana has told the New York Post .

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Part of Iceland was evacuated yesterday amid growing fears that the country’s Bardarbunga volcano is about to erupt. Airlines were on high alert as the centre of the island was hit by an earthquake every minute, signalling increased seismic activity below the volcano. If Bardarbunga erupts travel companies have been warned to prepare for a repeat of the chaos seen when Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano blew in 2010. A huge dust cloud shut down much of Europe’s airspace for six days, grounding 100,000 flights and affecting more than ten million people. Scroll down for video . This diagram shows how the ash could spread across Britain should the volcano erupt . Flights would be grounded because the extremely fine volcanic ash can jam the planes' engines . Bardarbunga: Iceland's largest volcano is seen from afar on a webcam positioned on Grimsfjoll mountain . At around . 3am yesterday between 300 and 500 people, mostly visitors, were ordered . to leave the highlands north of Bardarbunga, after 300 earthquakes shook . the area in just three hours. Tourists have been banned from visiting . the area, which is popular with hikers, and all roads are closed. Authorities . said an eruption might cause the Vatnajökull glacier – one of the . largest in Europe – which covers the volcano, to melt, causing mass . flooding. Iceland’s . Civil Protection Agency said: ‘It cannot be ruled out that the seismic . activity in Bardarbunga could lead to a volcanic eruption. The area is . now closed and has been evacuated.’ It added: . ‘These security measures have been taken since it would not be possible . to evacuate the area in time should a sub-glacial outburst flood occur . from Vatnajökull as a result of an eruption.’ Iceland issued a ‘code orange’ alert – the second highest risk level – to airlines on Tuesday, warning of possible disruption. Shaking all over: Nearly 300 earthquakes were detected near the Bardarbunga volcano this morning . With . millions of British families currently abroad for the summer holidays, . and many more planning getaways for the Bank Holiday weekend, the chaos . could be substantial. However, . the extent of the disruption depends on the wind direction during . eruption. At the moment, the prevailing winds are blowing south-east, . directly towards Britain. Forecasters in the UK are carefully monitoring . weather systems in the area. Laura Young, spokesman for the Met Office, said last night: ‘At the moment the air flow is coming from the north-west. ‘It looks . like it will stay that way until the early hours of Monday, when we are . expecting a change. If there is an eruption, it is all about timing. If . the air flow changed it might not affect us or European airspace at . all.’ Forecasting the wind direction is complicated because of the . potential height of the dust cloud. If the ash . is blown 20,000ft into the air, as the Eyjafjallajokull plume was in . 2010, it would be affected by unpredictable air flows in the upper . atmosphere. Chaos: The Eyjafjallajokull volcano erupted in 2010, creating massive disruptions for air travellers . At the moment the upper atmospheric winds are flowing in the same direction as surface winds, but that is not always the case. Miss Young . added: ‘The air moves around in different ways at various different . levels in the atmosphere. We cannot second-guess exactly which direction . any airflow in the upper atmosphere will change to.’ Einar . Einarsson of the Icelandic Meteorological Office, said seismic activity . was constant, adding: ‘It doesn’t seem to vary a lot – it is . concentrated in one area under the glacier.’ Dr Nicolas . Bellouin, an expert on atmospheric dust clouds at the University of . Reading, said: ‘Volcanic ash is a hazard to aircraft, because of . sandblasting of the outside of the plane and because particles are . sucked into the turbines where they can melt and disable the engines. ‘For that reason, aviation authorities impose a limit on the maximum concentration of ash aircraft can fly through.’ But he . added that a dust plume was ‘unlikely’ to have a dramatic effect on UK . weather and that those with health conditions affected by pollution . should not be ‘overly worried.'","Airlines preparing for repeat of the chaos seen when Eyjafjallajokull blew .

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . An airport runway was closed and flights diverted after an unexploded World War II bomb was found next to a highway close to Frankfurt airport. The 500kg device was discovered during construction work on a stretch of the A3 highway near Offenbach. Police shut off a 1,000 metre area of the autobahn, which is one of the busiest stretches of road in the country, causing long traffic jams. Disruptions: A stretch of the A3 highway near Offenbach was closed after the 500kg explosive was found . One of the airport's four runways was then closed for landings after experts warned that aircraft should avoid flying over the bomb site. The device had been outfitted with a chemical detonator, increasing the difficulty of the bomb disposal's job, who finally decided to destroy it in a controlled explosion after detonation was deemed impossible. Planes were allowed to take off from the runway, but only in the direction away from the bomb site. One of the airport's runways was closed for landings after experts advised against flying over the bomb site . Live bombs dating back to the aerial bombing of Germany during World War II are still frequently found. Most local authorities have teams working full-time to detect and defuse them. In May, bomb disposal experts were called  to Reddish, in Manchester, after a live World War Two bomb was found in an outside toilet. Police evacuated people from 10 houses on the street and neighbouring roads for around two hours, and set up a 100m cordon. The device was taken to nearby Reddish Vale Country Park where a controlled explosion was carried out.","Explosive found next to the busy A3 highway just outside the city .

"By . Anucyia Victor For Mailonline . Going on holiday is usually an exciting time, but flight delays can put a major dampener on travel plans. And unlucky travellers flying from Heathrow airport can expect the most disruption this summer. London's airports are the worst in the UK for flight hold-ups, with Heathrow topping the list in a new study. What's the hold up? Passengers waiting for their flights at Heathrow Terminal 3 . A total of 15,591 delays were recorded at Heathrow airport, with the longest lasting 23hrs 26mins . More than a quarter (27 per cent) of flights left the capital's major hub Heathrow more than 15 minutes late - adding up to 15,591 delays. Gatwick airport came in second with 8,912 (26 per cent) flights delayed. Luton had 1,934 (21 per cent) late departures and Stansted 2,967 (19 per cent) tardy flights, leaving thousands of passengers inconvenienced. The longest delay was at Manchester with a waiting time just shy of an entire day (23hrs 57mins). But Heathrow and Gatwick were not far behind with of 23hrs 26mins and 21hrs 23mins respectively. The figures were revealed by specialist solicitors Bott & Co. which analysed flights between UK airports and 18 of Britain's most popular summer holiday destinations including Cyprus, Egypt, Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Spain – including the Balearics and Canaries – and Turkey. It found flights to Larnaca in Cyprus had the highest chance of being held up with 12 per cent of summer flights there delayed. Second was Majorca's Palma airport, which saw 639 tardy flights – the late-running planes representing 10 per cent of the 5,866 flights to the island, . Just a single flight from Blackpool airport was delayed – 0.2 per cent of its 634 flights. And Robin Hood airport also proved its punctuality with just 1 per cent of its 666 flights leaving more than 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Playing the waiting game: Some travellers had to wait almost an entire day before jetting off on holiday . One to avoid? Flights to Larnaca airport in Cyprus had the highest chance of being held up . All three Turkish airports on the list fell outside the top ten: Antalya came 12th with 4 per cent of UK flights there delayed; Bodrum was 13th with 3.9 per cent of flights and Dalaman 15th with 3.4 per cent of flights. Heraklion airport in Greece is the least likely to keep you waiting, with just 2 per cent of the 886 flights there delayed. The shortest maximum recorded delay was at Robin Hood (1hr 34mins); Glasgow Prestwick (2hrs 58mins); and Norwich (3hrs 33mins). Heading home, Larnaca saw the longest hold-up of 24hrs 35mins. Tenerife was not far behind with 21hrs 3mins. Delayed passengers travelling in Europe can now claim up to up to Euro 600 per person for delays over three hours – depending on the delay length and flight distance. But delays caused by 'extraordinary circumstances' such as terrorism, sabotage, extreme weather conditions or industrial strikes are not eligible.","More than 27% of flights left Heathrow more than 15 minutes late .

"By . Anucyia Victor For Mailonline . Who said a McDonald’s is the same wherever you go? From the Dallas outlet housed in giant Happy Meal boxes to the restaurant in a stunning 1930s Art Deco hotel, diners who have had enough of run-of-the-mill outlets can now choose to eat in any one of these 14 unusual locations. With over 35,000 restaurants across the globe, it comes as no surprise that the American chain, which serves food in 118 countries, has some rather off-the-beaten-track sites. And, unsurprisingly, most of these strange fast food locations are all in the States. One outlet is housed in a preserved 19th-century Georgian Mansion in New York while another is in a converted  1930s Art Deco hotel, proving that that the fast-food giant doesn't always obliterate the unique character and history of towns it descends on. But, alongside the sensitively restored buildings, are some frankly bizarre locations as well. There’s an outlet smack bang in the middle of Israel’s Negev desert where discerning diners can chow down on burgers against an arid landscape of sand dunes. And those with far-left leanings don't have to miss out as the stalwarts of American capitalism have an outlet right below the Museum of Communism in Prague. Other unusual settings include the first ever ski-through restaurant, McSki in Lindvallen, Sweden, the UFO-shaped outlet in Roswell, New Mexico and rather incongruously, a restaurant set against the backdrop of the magnificent mountains in the picture-postcard pretty village of Yangshou, southern China. This outlet in Dallas, Texas looks like a giant Happy Meal box and and has giant sculptures of French fries, Big Macs and Ronald McDonald plastered all over it . The Golden Arches, set against a backdrop of majestic hills, seem out of place in the picturesque village of Yangshuo in Southern China . Viva capitalism: Prague's Museum of Communism, which has immersive workshops, an interrogation room and historical schoolrooms also has a McDonald's right below it . Take to the slopes: The world's first fast-food ski-through is in the resort of Lindvallen in Sweden. Customers can ski right up to the counter, order their food and ski off . Sensitive restoration: Try to spot the discreet McDonald's sign. The restaurant is set in this 1850s colonial house in Freeport, Maine which was once owned by a sea captain . Make a food withdrawal: Formerly a bank in Kristiansand, Norway this building now deals with nuggets of chicken rather than nuggets of gold . The ground floor of the Bray Town Hall in Northern Ireland has been home to McDonald's since 1997 . Views of sand, sand and more sand is what greets diners at the Negev Desert branch in Israel. The outlet does brisk business with tourists passing through the desert on their way to Israel's resort towns . Barstow Station McDonald's in California is set in refurbished rail cars and has a towering sign on the water tower for those who might just miss seeing the outlet . What's the difference: The Golden Arches were painted green in keeping with Sedona, Arizona's zoning ordinances. The company had to build a restaurant that blended into the natural setting . It's a Mctakeoff: The 20-seater McDonald's housed in a vintage luxury DC-3 plane with red and silver interior seats. The plane was bought by the fast-food chain who already have a restaurant next to it in Taupo, New Zealand . An invasion: Don't mistake this for a UFO. The Roswell outlet is, aptly enough, shaped like a flying saucer and attracts alien enthusiasts from across the world . The colonial era McDonald's, set in a 19th-century Georgian mansion in Hyde Park, New York. Local activists saved the building from being razed by petitioning to give it secured landmark status . The Art Deco McDonald's in Melbourne, Australia comes with a retro dining room and neon lights. The building was once the United Kingdom Hotel and was designed by architect James Hastie Wardrop.","Ski right up to the counter at the world's first ski-through restaurant in Lindvallen, Sweden .

As Britons across the UK look forward to the last Bank Holiday of the summer, research reveals the average person will spend an extra £113 over the three-day weekend. In a bid to make the most of their extra day off, Britons spend 120 per cent more than they would on a normal weekend. Over the course of an average weekend, people spend around £94 but when it comes to a Bank Holiday all thoughts of budget go out of the window – with spend increasing to a whopping £207 per weekend per person. Bank Holiday: Going for a walk and going on a day trip are listed in the top 10 activities to do over the weekend . 1. Go for a walk . 2. Life admin . 3. Go out for lunch . 4. Go on a day trip . 5. Go out for dinner . 6. Go out for breakfast . 7. Go away for the weekend . 8. Stay with friends . 9. Visit an attraction . 10. Have people to stay . Out of the 2,000 British adults questioned for the latest survey, one in eight claimed their spending got out of control, while nearly a quarter admitted they'd spend more than they usually would. While the luxury of having an extra day off allows Brits to fit in some cheap and cheerful activities, including long walks and life admin, eating out is hot on the agenda for the Bank Holiday. Those enjoying the extra day off will enjoy at least three meals at a bar or a restaurant - three times as often as on a normal weekend. Train carriages and car parks will also fill up as more than half of the UK's residents head out on a day trip away from their home town, with the average Brit budgeting £42.10 to get away. Going out for breakfast, lunch or dinner are among the top things that Brits like to do over the long weekend . Those in the West Midlands are set to splurge the most, spending 90 per cent more than on a normal weekend – £354.27 – followed by Londoners, who will splash £350.29 (80 per cent more), and people in Yorkshire, who will spend £310.98 (98 per cent more than usual). Brummies are most likely to hit their local attractions and eateries over the Bank Holiday, whilst the people of Wales are most likely to leave town and go away for the weekend. 'As the summer draws to a close, it's clear that we Brits are keen to go out with a bang, splurging more than double the amount we usually would as we make the most of the extra day off,' says Anita Naik, Consumer Editor of Vouchercodes.co.uk.","We're three times more likely to dine out over the long weekend .

US aviation officials have banned all American airlines from Syrian airspace in a notice that cites the threat of armed extremist groups who are equipped with anti-aircraft weapons. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned against flying in airspace over the war-torn country in the Middle East, but had not prohibited them. In an updated notice, the aviation authority said the change was based on updated assessment of risk and the lack of requests from carriers wishing to fly over Syria amid the unrest. The FAA has banned all US airlines from flying over Syria due to the ongoing armed conflict . The notice reads: ‘The ongoing armed conflict and volatile security environment in Syria poses a serious potential threat to civil aviation. ‘Armed extremist groups in Syria are known to be equipped with a variety of anti-aircraft weapons which have the capability to threaten civilian aircraft. ‘Opposition groups have successfully shot down Syrian military aircraft using these anti-aircraft weapon systems during the course of the conflict.’ The notice also cites previous threats from opposition groups, who have warned airlines to avoid flying into Syria. The FAA said: ‘Due to the presence of anti-aircraft weapons among the extremist groups and ongoing fighting in various locations throughout Syria, there is a continuing significant potential threat to civil aviation operating in Syrian airspace.’ The UK Civil Aviation Authority has issued its own warning about the dangers of flying within or near Syrian airspace, but it has not implemented a ban. The FAA says there has been a lack of requests from carriers wishing to fly over Syria amid the unrest . Very few airlines continue to fly over Syria. Data from FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking website, showed a handful of Syrian Air and Middle East Airlines flights operating regularly this month. In July, Malaysia Airlines faced criticism after it rerouted a flight over the country, just days after one of its planes was downed by a ground-to-air missile in eastern Ukraine. The FAA’s order was released as Small Arms Survey, an international research group that tracks the global flow of weapons, released a report that says armed groups in Syria have several hundred portable anti-aircraft missiles in their arsenal. The missiles could be used to destroy low-flying commercial planes, the report warns. Civil war: A report by Small Arms Survey warns about the threat of anti-aircraft missiles in Syria . Many airlines have already been avoiding airspace over conflict zones in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine. Carriers have been taking greater care since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over the conflict zone in Ukraine last month. All 298 people aboard the passenger jet were killed. Earlier this month, the FAA barred US airlines from flying over Iraq as the armed conflict there intensified and the US launched airstrikes targeting militants belonging to the Islamic State.","FAA notice says extremist groups are armed with anti-aircraft weapons .

In footage captured on-board the rescue boat, the whale appears to be dragging the vessel along as the crew figures out how to free it while it continues to swim in the ocean. Initially the disentanglement team was sent out on Tuesday but was unable to carry out the rescue until late Thursday afternoon, 37km off the coast of Geraldton.

Defiance in the face of evil: From left, Japan's Naoto Tajima (bronze), American Jesse Owens (gold), and Germany's Luz Long (silver) giving a Nazi salute . ‘Almost singlehandedly, Owens obliterated Hitler's plans,’ SCP Auctions partner Dan Imler said. ‘You've got an African American, son of a sharecropper, grandson of slaves who overcame these incredible circumstances and delivered a performance for the ages,’ he added. Despite his legendary performance, Mr Owens was unable to find work, and even gifted one of his gold medals to dancer and movie star Bill ‘Bojangles’ Robinson out of gratitude for helping him find work. ‘They formed a friendship and also a professional relationship,’ said Mr Imler. ‘Bojangles helped Owens get work in the entertainment field.’ Record setter: Jesse Owens (r) breaks the tape to win gold in the 100-meter dash in a record time of 10.3 seconds .

Mr Owens arrived at the 1936 Olympics as one of many objects of scorn of the hateful dictator Mr Hitler. The Nazi leader had grand visions of organizing the games to be a showcase of the superior genes and talent possessed by Aryans. The Germans won a total of 89 medals, the United States’ 56 were second, but it was Mr Owens’ performance that made the German leader throw fits.

"By . Matt Chorley . and Daniel Martin . Controversial: Deputy children's commissioner Sue Berelowitz said the 'model' of Asian men targeting white girls was just one of 'a number of models' The author of report into gang sex abuse today hit back at government criticism of her findings that there was no particular problem among Asian groups. The study by deputy children’s commissioner Sue Berelowitz came to the controversial conclusion, despite figures in her own report revealing that more than a quarter of perpetrators of gang-based child abuse known to the authorities are Asian. Senior Whitehall figures have branded the report 'hysterical' and 'highly emotional'. Last night a Government source said it . was ‘difficult to overstate the contempt’ with which ministers viewed . the report’s conclusions. And the NSPCC said the report exposed the danger of ‘turning a blind eye’ to the ethnicity of abusers. Miss Berelowitz said the ‘model’ of . Asian men targeting white girls was just one of ‘a number of models’, . and warned that if investigators concentrated on those patterns, victims . could fall through the net. And today she challenged ministers to take her report seriously, warning them it was a 'wake-up call'. 'This is a very calm, measured report,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'We have left out the most harrowing details, really shocking distressing stories that children have told us, that we have heard form police. I would say to the government: This is a wake up call. 'This is the most comprehensive pulling together of sexual abuse in England. They need to take it very seriously and show some leadership.' She denied that the problem of Asian men targeting white girls had been 'left out' of her report, but repeatedly insisted it 'is only one model' of abuse. She also appeared to blame police forces and councils for failing to collect information on the race and faith of perpetrators. Of the information, of the data sent to us by the police and local authorities about perpetrators, in six out of 10 cases there was no information available - the ethnicity and faith was not identified. 'Where children are falling through the net because people think it there is only one model of abuse this is a wake up call,' she added. 'We have heard evidence from the police forces that there are white males doing this across the country in fairly large numbers.' Dim light: Figures in the report state that out of 1,514 perpetrators identified, some 415 were Asian (file photo) She said there was not evidence to conclude that there was a particular issue with Asian gangs. Instead, her report says simply that abuse is carried out by men of all backgrounds. In . May, nine Asian men who groomed white girls as young as 13 in Rochdale . with drink and drugs were jailed at Liverpool Crown Court. Judge . Gerald Clifton told them one of the reasons they targeted their victims . was because they were not part of their community or religion. Last year Abid Saddique was jailed for his role as ringleader of a Derby gang that cruised streets for girls as young as 12 who were plied with vodka and cocaine before being raped or abused. Pakistani origin: Abid Saddique was jailed for his role as ringleader of a Derby gang that cruised streets for girls as young as 12 before raping or abusing them . Saddique, who is of Pakistani origin, took the vulnerable young girls to ‘parties’ in hotels or flats with other gang members. Two months ago, documents emerged which allegedly showed agencies in Rotherham were aware of allegations of widespread targeted abuse of teenage girls in the town by groups of Asian men – but did nothing for fear of looking racist. Andrew Flanagan, chief executive of the NSPCC, said: ‘If there is a problem with one community in a particular area we must be bold enough to address it and not just turn a blind eye.’ A Government source said: ‘It is difficult to overstate the contempt the Government has for the methodology and analysis in this report. The whole thing is half-baked.’ Figures in the report state that out of 1,514 perpetrators identified, some 415 were Asian. This is 27 per cent of the total, far in excess of the proportion of Asian people in the community at large, which is 6 per cent. Some 545 are described as white, 244 as black, 49 as mixed, while the rest were undisclosed. But Miss Berelowitz’s report said: ‘Different models of exploitation have been identified. The evidence is clear that perpetrators come from all ethnic groups and so do their victims – contrary to what some may wish to believe.’ The report suggested the proportion of Asian perpetrators in the figures may be higher than whites because the authorities were targeting non-whites. Unhappy: Tory MP Margot James said it was 'very disappointing' that the report shied away from tackling a 'specific problem in certain Asian communities - specifically the Pakistani community' It even concluded that the data on ethnicity was ‘unreliable’ because victims sometimes changed their description of their abuser. 'On the face of it, this is an issue for all ethnicities, but there is a specific problem in certain Asian communities – specifically the Pakistani community – in too many cities to ignore the phenomenon. Unless we recognise the problem, we won’t be able to devise a strategy for tackling it' Tory MP Margot James . A Whitehall source said last week: ‘It’s important we don’t take a politically correct approach and pretend there is not a real problem here. 'Obviously abuse has been carried out by men from all sorts of ethnic background. But that doesn’t mean we cannot say there is an issue about groups of Pakistani men systematically targeting young white girls.’ Tory MP Margot James said: ‘On the face of it, this is an issue for all ethnicities, but there is a specific problem in certain Asian communities – specifically the Pakistani community – in too many cities to ignore the phenomenon. ‘Unless we recognise the problem, we won’t be able to devise a strategy for tackling it. 'It is very disappointing that this report has shied away from it, given the fact that some leadership is coming from within the Asian community. They need support.’","Fury at result of Deputy children's commissioner Sue Berelowitz's study .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A council has finally apologised over the way it handled a decision to remove three Eastern European children from foster parents who were members of Ukip. Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council maintained that the removal of the siblings last November was in their 'best interests'. But it also said membership of the UK Independence Party was not a valid reason to take foster children from their carers and the issue was badly communicated. U-turn: Joyce Thacker, Rotherham Borough Council's head of children's services, said in November that social workers had been right to remove three children from the care of their UKIP member foster parents, but now the council has admitted that party membership was not a valid reason to take action . In a statement, the local authority said a . detailed review had found that the action to remove the brother and . sisters was in their best interests. It added: 'However, we accept the impression left following media interviews on the morning of November 24 was that the removal of the children was solely because of the foster carers' membership of Ukip and the council apologises for this. 'As this is a child care case, legal reasons continue to prevent us from releasing further details. However, we know that there are important lessons the council must learn. 'As a consequence, the council has taken action to strengthen the way it makes decisions, communicates and shares information.' The children, a baby girl, a boy and an older girl, were removed by social workers after the council reportedly received an anonymous tip-off about the foster parents' membership of the right-wing party. Social workers reportedly said they were concerned about the children's 'cultural and ethnic needs'. Standing by its decision: Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council (above) maintained that the removal of the siblings was in their 'best interests' The head of children’s services in Rotherham defended the decision, saying that their affiliation to Ukip meant they opposed ‘multiculturalism.’ Joyce Thacker, Rotherham Borough Council’s director of children and young people’s services, said the children’s ‘cultural and ethnic needs’ did not fit with the parent’s ‘strong views.’ But in today's statement, Rotherham council clarified its position on party membership. 'The council can confirm that membership of Ukip would not prevent any individual from being considered as a foster carer in Rotherham and could not be a reason for removing foster children from a placement,' it said. In November, the couple, a qualified . nursery nurse and a former Royal Navy reservist, were backed by . Education Secretary Michael Gove. Mr Gove said social workers had made 'the wrong decision in the wrong way for the wrong reasons'. In defence of the foster parents: Education secretary Michael Gove said in November that social workers had made 'the wrong decision in the wrong way for the wrong reasons' He pledged to personally investigate the case, adding: 'Rotherham's reasons for denying this family the chance to foster are indefensible.' The birth parents of the three children were later revealed to be a Slovakian couple who have had six of their offspring taken away by social workers. The father accused council staff of 'racism' and of destroying his family as he told how 20 police officers ‘raided’ their home to remove their last four children. He claimed social workers picked on the family because they are Roma and disapproved of their non-British 'lifestyle'. As reported in the Daily Mail in December, the Slovak father told friends: 'It is the social services who have been racist against my family.' The foster parents said they were planning legal action after their foster agency said the council had accused them of leaking information to the press about the children and their birth parents. They told the Guardian in December: 'If Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council are accusing us of a breach of confidentiality and do not issue a formal apology in order to clear our name we may be forced to seek legal action to protect our future as foster parents.' Ukip today said it did not wish to comment on the council's statement.","Social workers took three Eastern European children away in November .

"By . Reuters Reporter . and Joel Christie For Mailonline . Jellyfish stung at least 400 Florida beachgoers over the weekend, prompting lifeguards to raise purple flags warning of hazardous marine life off the state's east coast, authorities said on Monday. Officers said the jellyfish swarm arrived on Friday and has remained concentrated around New Smyrna Beach, on the Atlantic coast in the north-central part of the state. Tropical Storm Cristobal, a potential hurricane headed towards the US after wreaking havoc in the Caribbean, is believed to have pushed the jellyfish closer to shore, according to My Fox Tampa Bay. 'It could be thousands,' said Volusia County Beach Safety Captain Tammy Marris. Write caption here . 'Thousands': Volusia County Beach Patrol officials believe the swarms of jellyfish were forced closer to shore by winds from the storms in the tropics . Proceed with caution: Lifeguards put up purple flags to warn swimmers of what was in the water, causing many to get out . Moving fast: By Momday evening Hurricane . Cristobal had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was . tracking east at 2 mph (4 kp). This map shows its expected path this week . East Coast: Officials have not said whether the jellyfish problem will continue north as Cristobal tracks the coast . 'It's hard to see them in the water right now. All you can see are the ones on shore.' No one was seriously injured, Marris said. Lifeguards treated most of the victims with a splash of vinegar, which quickly halts the burning pain of the sting. Jellyfish stings can be dangerous or fatal in rare cases in which the victim is severely allergic to the venom. Marris said the size of the swarm and number of people stung are not unusual, adding that it is hard for beachgoers to predict when the jellyfish will wash towards shore. 'They're at the mercy of the wind and the current,' she said. Jellyfish are gelatinous, umbrella-shaped animals with long, trailing tentacles that release venomous stingers on contact with skin or prey. They can appear in various colors but typically surface with a translucent milky color on central Florida beaches. Smart: Some clever beachgoers decided the best way to deal with the jellyfish was to put their chairs in the shallows . High winds: Twenty five mph winds from the Northeast and rough surf hit the Jacksonville Beach in Florida on Monday as a result of Tropical Storm Cristobal traveling up the coast . Local lifeguards stock vinegar, which can deactivate the stingers, as can salt water. Fresh or tap water can reactivate them. Stung beachgoers can also find relief by submerging their wounds in hot water. A storm front on Monday churned up the surf, which was calm over the weekend, but so far has not washed the jellyfish out to sea, officials said.

"By . Luke Augustus for MailOnline . Follow @@Luke_Augustus29 . His Manchester United debut lasted 69 minutes but in that time Angel di Maria gave Red Devils supporters more than a glimpse of what is to come from their new No 7 in the future. Di Maria has only trained twice with his new team-mates, since his £60million move from Real Madrid on Tuesday, yet in spells on Saturday afternoon at Turf Moor it seemed he had been at  United longer as he linked up neatly with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal deployed the 26-year-old in central midfield of his 3-5-2 formation and Di Maria showed his energetic qualities that helped Real win a Copa del Rey and Champions League double last term. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Angel di Maria's career highlights . Impressive watch: Angel di Maria played well on his Manchester United debut at Burnley on Saturday . Into the fire: Di Maria (centre) walks out onto the pitch as a Manchester United player for the first time . Closely monitored: Di Maria (centre) tries to fend the ball from Burnley opponents . United's early season performances have been lethargic and the Argentina international added a much-needed injection of pace going forward. In the opening stages at Burnley Di Maria's first involvement in the match saw a trademark dribble ended by an over-hit pass into the path of Rooney. The skill involved, as he beat two men in the heart of Burnley's midfield, was warmly appreciated by the travelling United supporters who chanted 'Argentina! Argentina!' in honour of their new £60m acquisition. Welcome to England: Di Maria (bottom) wins his first Premier League free-kick after 12 mins . Di Maria's influence into the match grew as United weathered the opening 10-minute storm from Sean Dyche's side who pressed and pressurised the visitor's shaky defence. The midfielder's move to the Theatre of Dreams broke the British transfer record fee and United supporters got their first insight into why their club paid a premium price to acquire Di Maria's talents on 14 minutes. Collecting the ball on the half-way line, Di Maria sprayed a beautiful 40-yard pass into the path of Van Persie who saw his shot saved by Tom Heaton. Ping: Di Maria almosts assisted after 14 minutes when he played a delightful 40-yard pass to Robin van Persie . At Real last season, the Argentine created the most assists in Europe's top five leagues with 17, and the vision he showed to pick out Van Persie was evident in what was the move of the match. That pass was one of 33 he attempted on his debut at Turf Moor, and the midfielder soon once again neatly linked up with Van Persie to create another opening for Van Gaal's side. Sharing is caring: Di Maria attempted 33 passes during his 69 minute showing at Turf Moor . Surging down the left flank, he performed a one-two with Van Persie, flicking the ball to the Dutchman, before crossing to Juan Mata who slipped just as he was about to shoot from 10 yards out. Playing nominally in the heart of United's midfield there were times however when Di Maria struggled to cope with his defensive duties. Primarily brought in as an attack-minded player the former Real galactico lost half of his personal duels when challenging for the ball. Getting stuck in: Di Maria (right) tackles Dean Marney (left) for the ball in midfield . Role reversal: Di Maria (top) is dispossesed by  Marney (bottom) in the first-half on Saturday . Blank canvas: Di Maria failed to register any tackles, clearances or blocks during the match vs Burnley . He failed to register any tackles, clearances or blocks and was at fault for man-of-the-match David Jones' blistering volley that David de Gea did well to tip over for a corner in the first-half. Van Gaal didn't buy Di Maria for his defensive abilities though and the Dutchman must find a way to utilise his new signing's main assets in a different way - be it with a change of formation perhaps as his winless start in the United hotseat continues. For Real and Argentina - Di Maria shone in a 4-3-3 formation drifting out to the left-hand side during matches from his central role and his most destructive work for United came in the second-half doing just that but in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation. Marauder: Match Zone's heat map shows Di Maria did most of his work down the left-hand side for United . On 52 minutes he gave the Burnley defence a warning of his speed, providing Rooney an overlap before seeing his drive blocked by Kieran Trippier. Six minutes later the 26-year-old showed his blistering pace out-muscling and out-sprinting Trippier down the left flank before his ricocheted cross found Rooney. The newly-appointed England captain's mishit effort fell back to Van Persie who saw his deflected left-footed volley cleared off the line by Dean Marney. Denied: Di Maria's (top) one shot in the match was blocked by Kieran Trippier (bottom) Expensive taste: Di Maria's £60m to United broke a British record transfer fee . Shortly after that thrilling burst though, Di Maria's afternoon was ended when he was replaced by Anderson on 69 minutes. Moments before that the Premier League's most expensive player went down with cramp much to the worry with everyone connected to the club. Van Gaal later confirmed that his latest signing was taken off as a precaution after taking a kick to his calf. Impressive viewing: Louis van Gaal (third left) will have been pleased with Di Maria's debut at Turf Moor . Down and out? Di Maria (left) had to be substituted after 69 minutes after taking a kick to his calf . Overall Di Maria's performance was the only real positive for United as they struggled to break down Premier League new boys Burnley. His industrious display mixed with his unquestionable quality will be a welcome addition to United as they look to rebuild from last season's disastrous campaign. It's clear that United have problems elsewhere though and Van Gaal has until the transfer window closes on September 1 to address these problems. If not, then the qualities of Di Maria may not get to be displayed at the Theatre of Dreams as often as United supporters will wish for. Encouraging start: United fans will be hoping Di Maria can kick on after making his debut for the club .","Angel di Maria played well as Manchester United struggled at Burnley .

"By . Damien Gayle . This spring-heeled impala must be thankful for his sharp reflexes after he leapt high into the air to narrowly avoid the snapping jaws of a hungry crocodile. The predator's desperate lunge sent the animal high-jumping into the air, startling the yellow-billed oxpeckers that were resting on his back. Although it was a lucky escape for the impala, one can't help but feel pity for the crocodile - a specimen whose clumsy attempts to find a meal are a source of mirth to local guides. Leap: A spring-heeled impala jumps into the air to avoid the snapping jaws of this hungry crocodile in Zambia . That's some altitude: The impala continues its impressive leap as his fellows decide they had better flee too . Airtime: Even before the startled impala has landed from his leap, his pals have made good their escape . Where's everybody gone? The hungry crocodile, it turns out, is well known to local guides for being 'useless' The crocodile had arrived slowly, gliding across the surface of the still water, before hiding beneath at the very edge of the river bank, where it was spotted by a steely-eyed elephant. The protective pachyderm saw that the crocodile had moved itself into an attack position and unsuccessfully tried to shepherd the impala away from the riverside - even at one point trying to stamp on the submerged predator. But the impala failed to heed the elephant's warning and their protector eventually lost patience and drifted away - leaving the crocodile free to make his move. The dramatic images of his attack were captured by Kendal-based amateur photographer Rob Brookes, 64, at the South Luangwa National Park in Zambia, where he was on safari with wife Sue. Three elephants drinking water together shortly before the abortive attack: A protective pachyderm had tried to warn the impalas and even give the crocodile a good kick before they eventually lost interest . Mr Brookes said: 'Even though I knew it was there, the expectation was tremendous as neither Sue nor myself have ever seen a croc attack and certainly not from the four metres or so we were away from this one. 'Our guides were familiar with this croc and had very little regard for its ability, describing it as ""useless"". Nonetheless I was holding my breath for longer than was healthy.' The scene was played out on the banks of the Luangwa river which, at the very end of the dry season, had been reduced to a series of connected but quite shallow pools. 'Rather surprisingly the impala didn't retreat very far from the crocodile after the attack and soon returned to the river bank,' said Mr Brookes. 'They were however, very nervous and startled themselves with their own reflections for several minutes. 'As soon as three or four of them had settled down and resumed drinking, the croc once again launched an attack but for some unknown reason this was completely in the wrong direction from where the impala were and served only to confirm the low opinion our guides had of him. 'All in all I believe it managed five unsuccessful attacks during that day.'",Dramatic scene captured at the South Luangwa National Park in Zambia .
"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . An epilepsy sufferer was left with a fractured skull after a group of teenagers attacked him with a brick in an attempt to make suffer a seizure. Tony Cartlidge was walking through Northwood Park in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, when he was set upon earlier this month. The 23-year-old claims the group had launched a bullying campaign against him in an an attempt to make him suffer a seizure, and said this was the second they had attacked him. Tony Cartlidge, who has epilepsy, had a brick thrown at his head by a group of teenagers who he claims were trying to make him suffer a seizure . The 23-year-old spent two nights in hospital after the brick struck him on the head leaving him with a nasty gash to his forehead that required stitches . In the latest incident, on August 15, Mr Cartlidge was chased by a man wielding a machete, before being struck on the head with a brick which one of the group had hurled over a fence. Mr Cartlidge said: 'I felt something hit my head and when I looked down a brick was on the floor. 'There was blood all over me. They want me to have a fit. 'I’m constantly getting called a ‘smackhead’ because I shake on the floor when I have a fit. 'They found out that epileptic people can wet themselves when they have fits and that’s what they’ve been trying to do.' Mr Cartlidge spent two nights in hospital following the attack. He is constantly reminded of the trauma of the assault every time he puts on his trainers, 'because they're still covered in my blood'. Mr Cartlidge crouches down next to a brick at Northwood Park in Stoke-on-Trent where the assault took place .

The unemployed man, who lives in Northwood, Stoke-on-Trent, said he has been targeted by the same group of neighbourhood youths before. Two weeks ago he said he was hit in the back of the head with a pair of knuckle dusters and challenged to a fight. Treasurer of the Northwood Residents’ Association, Alan Wrench, said 'it is a surprise to hear about something like this'.  Other local residents called for urgent police action. Pensioner Madge Morris, 81, said: 'There are people knocking about and I have seen youngsters coming down here late at night when they should be in bed. 'If they are old enough to do the crime, they are old enough to be disciplined.' Peter Johnson, 80, said: 'I think it is terrible. It makes you wonder what the law is doing about it. 'You wouldn’t expect that to happen round here. I think teenagers now have nothing else to do.' Staffordshire Police confirmed one man was arrested following the ordeal on suspicion of affray. He has since been bailed as officers continue their investigation.","Tony Cartlidge claims he is the victim of a campaign of bullying .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Roy Hodgson is well aware of the need to bring back the 'feel-good factor' when England kick off a new era against Norway. A new-look side led by a new captain, Wayne Rooney, have been charged with getting the Three Lions back on track nine weeks on from bombing out of the World Cup at the first hurdle. The disappointment of that failure in Brazil will be underlined by the plethora of empty seats at Wembley on Wednesday, when the lowest attendance since the stadium opened in 2007 is expected for the friendly with Norway. Fresh start: England manager Roy Hodgson knows he needs to get the public back on side after the World Cup . Preparation: Rickie Lambert (second from left) challenges Jack Wilshere (third from right) for the ball . All the talk of a new beginning has clearly not appeased fans and Hodgson knows it is now up to his players to prove it on the pitch. 'We've only been together since Sunday evening, but we seem to have crammed an awful lot into that period of time with our meetings and with our training sessions,' he said on the eve of the match. 'I certainly get the feeling that the players can't wait, really, to kick off this new campaign and kick it off with an important and quite difficult game at Wembley. 'I am confident that the players are really ready to go and of course now it's all a question of when they cross the white line and the referee blows his whistle because all the talking in the world doesn't help you. It is what you do the field that counts.' After a friendly against Norway - ranked 53rd in the world - comes the start of England's European Championship qualifiers in Switzerland. Monday's match in Basel may well prove their toughest of Group E, although back-to-back victories would certainly improve the national mood. In control: Wilshere (right) fends off Leighton Baines and Danny Welbeck during training at London Colney . On the run: Forward Danny Welbeck (centre) bursts away from Wayne Rooney (left) during training . 'There are things you can't guarantee and wanting it doesn't guarantee you are going to get it,' Hodgson said. 'Of course, we would all very, very much like to get two good results now, starting with tomorrow night and get that feel-good factor. 'We're also still aware that the two-year journey is a longish one, one that you'll see an awful lot of changes within the team and in terms of the way the team plays and plays together. 'A lot of these players won't have played together particularly and a lot of them will be very, very new in their international careers. 'As time goes on, those things will improve, of course, but I can't disagree that this will be a good time to get two good results, two good performances and to show everyone my faith in the team is justified.' Hodgson is planning to field a 'young team' against Norway, although revealed none of the four uncapped players in the 22-man squad will start. In discussion: Hodgson, pictured speaking to Gary Neville (left) and Ray Lewington (right), will not start any of his four uncapped players against Norway . Intense: Defender John Stones (left) and James Milner (right) tussle for the ball on Monday . While Calum Chambers, Fabian Delph and Danny Rose may get a chance off the bench, Jack Colback will have to wait. The Newcastle midfielder will be available for the Switzerland match but a knock rules him out of the Wembley encounter, where he could be joined on the sidelines by Danny Welbeck. Having secured a £16million deadline-day move from Manchester United, the Arsenal new boy took a knock in training on the eve of the game to put his participation in doubt. 'We are happy for Danny he felt the move might lead to more regular football and that will only be to our advantage and we think or hope he will be ready to start,' Hodgson said. 'But unfortunately in training today he did manage to receive a knock in the session, but I have been assured he is okay and that it will not rule him out, but obviously I suppose it could happen. 'I would be very disappointed if he could not play tomorrow because of what happened with the last kick of the session.'","Roy Hodgson and England face Norway in first game since the World Cup .

"By . Mark Wilson For The Daily Mail . For Ally McCoist, a brief period when football dominated the agenda at Rangers came to an abrupt halt on Friday. Two hours before the Ibrox manager conducted a 9am press briefing at Murray Park, a statement to the Stock Exchange spelled out the precarious financial position at the club. The launch of a new share issue is intended to raise £4million to provide a stop-gap injection of funds. An uptake of at least £3m is required for it to go ahead. Concern: Ally McCoist is worried about the club's perilous finances and the prospect of administration . Should that fail to happen, said the release from the board, then ‘the company will be unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the company will be uncertain. The directors will immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available’. Those were words to chill supporters. Ibrox sources discount the possibility of a second administration, pointing out that the only two creditors are shareholders Sandy Easdale and George Letham, who provided £1.5m in loans last season. In the event of non-repayment, they would be granted security over the Albion car park and Edmiston House facilities at Ibrox. Disgraced: Craig Whyte put Rangers into administration in 2012 when he was in charge of the club . Others, though, are not so certain. Having bubbled away in the background while the fluctuating form of McCoist’s team drew attention, monetary worries are once again front and centre at Rangers. McCoist has been down this particular road many times. Ever since the cracks began to appear in Craig Whyte’s scandalous tenure almost three years ago, he has been confronted by a variety of looming off-field crises. It was with a certain weariness, therefore, that he insisted he would only answer questions relating to football matters. But even those issues are far from immune from the wider situation. With the transfer window closing on Monday night, Rangers look decidedly vulnerable to offers for any of their key players. Could the board reject an even half-decent offer for stalwart left-back Lee Wallace or precocious midfielder Lewis Macleod? Hot prospect: Midfielder Lewis Macleod has impressed for Rangers but could be sold to raise funds . McCoist hopes there will be no need to learn the answer to that question as he expressed his desire to keep together a squad seeking to gain promotion from the Championship at the first attempt. Asked if he was confident bids could be turned down, the Ibrox boss said: ‘I would obviously hope so as a manager. If I’m happy with my squad then you don’t want to see it being depleted. ‘But I do know what’s involved in football and I know that sometimes people make decisions that can alter your squad. That’s part and parcel of football. ‘I would hope that no bids come in for any of the players. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens. ‘If we did lose someone we’d just have to regroup and get on with it. As I say, I’m not expecting to lose anyone. I’m expecting to go with the squad we’ve got and hopefully that’s the case.’ McCoist said he had not been informed by chief executive Graham Wallace of a need to sell during their discussions. He had previously hoped some squad movement might allow him to augment his midfield options but that now appears a non-starter. Saturday's home game against Queen of the South, unbeaten so far in the Championship, will restore football to prominence for 90 minutes or so. It will be interesting to see whether further supporter dissent is aired against the board, but McCoist doesn’t expect an impact on his players. Money men: Chief executive Graham Wallace may allow players to be sold before the transfer window closes . ‘Our supporters have been fantastic in handling everything that has been thrown at them,’ he said. ‘We’ve sold 23,000 season tickets and, say what you like, that is fantastic support for us. As long as the team continue to give them everything that they can in terms of their effort and attempt to play in the right manner and win games, then the fans will stick by the team 100 per cent.’ The concern felt among many supporters was made clear, however, by a stinging retort from the Union of Fans to the Stock Exchange statement. They attacked the lack of investment progress since last December’s AGM and questioned why more had not been done to facilitate Dave King’s involvement. The South African-based businessman rejected an approach to underwrite the £4m share issue, apparently through unhappiness about the conditions. He has previously expressed a desire to invest up to £30m in Rangers in return for significant boardroom influence. Such a move would, though, require shareholder approval and dilute the existing power base. ‘The board’s inaction and incompetence over the past nine months has led the club once again into an extremely precarious financial position which could easily have been avoided,’ said the Union of Fans. Fire sale: Full back Lee Wallace is another player who may have to be sold because of Rangers' lack of money . ‘Graham Wallace and the other board members have known for at least nine months that significant levels of investment were required not only to see out the current season but also to invest properly in the club. 'They have also been, or should have been, well aware that this level of investment would not be raised from current shareholders and that only those with a genuine love for the club were willing to put such sums in. ‘They have continually refused to take the necessary steps to allow those outside the existing shareholder base to invest the funds required. Indeed, they have continued to pursue every option to keep those people out. ‘They now hang the threat of a second administration over the heads of both fans and shareholders when they remain fully aware that funding can be brought in from outside. For the avoidance of doubt, if this board would finally start to do their job properly, there can be absolutely no threat of administration. A £30m funding package has been available for at least the past seven months and remains available.’ Happier times: McCoist and Paul Gascoigne celebrate wining the Coca-Cola Cup in 1996 . The statement added: ‘Fans and shareholders should not be blackmailed into servicing this board. ‘They are doing everything in their power to keep those who care about the club from having any control over its destiny. ‘We ask them to finally do the right thing, stop putting their own positions and salaries ahead of the welfare of the club, gain shareholder approval for significant, much-needed investment and allow those who care about Rangers to take it back to where it belongs.’","Rangers may not be able to pay their creditors, and go into administration .

"By . Mark Wilson For The Daily Mail . Rangers failed to persuade Dave King to underwrite the £4million share issue the club launched yesterday as they desperately attempt to combat their mounting financial crisis. The Ibrox board released a statement to the Stock Exchange which revealed an uptake from existing shareholders of at least £3m would be required for the issue to go ahead. It carried a stark warning that failure to reach that amount would mean Rangers being ‘unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the Company will be uncertain’. In that event, directors will ‘immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available’. No go: South African-based businessman Dave King ,pictured here at Ibrox, won't underwrite the shares issue . Ibrox sources have discounted the prospect of a second administration as a consequence, but football finance expert Neil Patey, of Ernst and Young, told Sportsmail that cannot be ruled out. Succeeding with the share issue would provide breathing space and Sportsmail understands an approach was made to King ahead of the launch. The South African-based businessman has previously stated a willingness to invest £30m into the club but is seeking significant boardroom influence in return. While he is not an existing shareholder eligible to buy into the new issue, King would have been able to play an underwriting role to plug any shortfall. Talks broke down, however, with the Castlemilk-born businessman seemingly unhappy at the terms and a lack on information. Back on the brink: If the shares issues fails to reach at least £3m then Rangers' future could be uncertain again . ‘We have spoken with Mr King but the content of our discussion shall remain private,’ a Rangers spokesman told Sportsmail yesterday while King himself was unavailable for comment. One City source did, however, confirm the nature of the talks and detailed why King had rejected the offer. ‘There was an approach to King but he pointed out the money wasn’t enough to cover the club’s short-term needs,’ said the source. ‘There was also dubiety about whether it would provide shares. It could still have proceeded but he wanted Rangers to provide access to the books, which was refused. That ended it.’ The issue has now been launched without an underwriter but Newcastle owner Mike Ashley could yet play a significant role. He remains keen to expand his stake while remaining beneath levels that govern dual ownership. Off-field distractions: Rangers manager Ally McCoist (left) attempts to focus on the playing side of the club . The need for income at Rangers has been increased by a drop in season-ticket sales from 36,000 to 23,000 and the requirement to repay £1.5m in loans received from shareholders George Letham and Sandy Easdale. They were due their money by close of business yesterday but that deadline has been extended until the end of the share-issue process on September 18. Failure to repay would see Letham and Easdale gain security over the Albion car park and Edmiston House facilities at Ibrox. The Stock Exchange statement revealed Rangers had just £1.54m of accessible cash at the end of June and made it clear the share issue was only a stop-gap measure. Success needed: Rangers will hope the Glasgow giants can gain promotion from the Scottish Championship . It said: ‘Assuming full subscription, the Company will require additional external funding in the latter half of the current financial year in order to meet working capital requirements as a result of the cyclical nature of its business. At the minimum level of subscription, additional working capital will be required towards the end of the current calendar year.’ It is thought the intention is to reach an AGM in October or November and gain shareholder approval for a wider issue that would be cornerstone of the aim to bring in between ‘£20m-£30m’ over the next three years. King could enter the fray at that point but the immediate future is the most pressing concern. Patey, who has followed the Rangers saga, believes the coming weeks will be vital. ‘I think this is probably the worst point since coming out of administration two years ago,’ he said. ‘There is obviously a clear, short-term cash shortfall. And therefore you can’t rule out a chain of events that leads to there not being enough funding there. ‘I don’t think that we are looking at administration just yet, but it is quite a stark financial situation they are in right now. There is a crucial period coming up. It is a very important two to three months.’","Financially troubled Scottish giants have attempted to raise around £4million with new shares being made available to existing shareholders .

"By . Paul Newman for MailOnline . Joe Root was forced to deal with criticism from too close to home for comfort but was adamant that England are on the right path to one-day riches. The demolition of England’s one-day approach by Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan in a BBC wet-weather radio debate was eye-catching because Swann in particular has so recently stepped outside of the team environment. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Root says England can take winning momentum into ODIs . Hope: Root is convinced that the Test players who defeated India will prove equally adapt at the shorter game . Yet Root, a flag carrier for the new England after an outstanding summer, is convinced that the Test players who defeated India will prove equally adapt at the shorter game when the one-day series makes its belated introduction on Wednesday. The crux of Swann and Vaughan’s argument is that England’s 50-over cricket remains in the dark ages under a captain in Alastair Cook who should have rested up after proving his Test point and left this to the big-hitting kids. Not so, said Root, who hopes England will prove one of their best captains and one of their greatest spinners wrong, starting against India at Cardiff. Claim: Swann and Vaughan believe England's 50-over cricket remains in the dark ages under Alastair Cook . Overlooking: Peter Moores looks on during a net session ahead of Wednesday's ODI with India . ‘I think guys have been picked because they’re very capable of making big scores in one-day games,’ said the man who will one day replace Cook as captain in both formats. ‘We’ve prepared really well and it’s exciting for us. Those guys are paid for their opinions and they are entitled to give them, but we know where we are as a side. We are comfy and ready to go.’ England must have thought Cook’s position would have ceased to be an issue after runs and three successive Test wins but Root, who scored more than 700 runs in the Test summer, was obliged to come to the captain’s defence. ‘He’s our leader in one-day cricket as well as Tests, he’s done well over a number of years and we all back him,’ said Root of Cook. ‘He’s a fantastic player and has got all our support. His style complements players like Alex Hales and hopefully that can be shown this series. We want to show what we can do as a one-day outfit. I don’t think there’s much of a problem with the batting.’ Stroke: Gary Ballance hits out past bowler Root during England net practice . In sight: England bowler James Anderson playing American Football during the training session . The argument is a fascinating one. England, yet to win a World Cup and outsiders in next year’s tournament in Australia and New Zealand, were widely expected to introduce more than just Hales from the next generation here. But a combination of outstanding performances in the last three Tests from the likes of Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali coupled with the largely poor form of the Lions top order against New Zealand A this season forced a partial re-think. Certainly Swann’s assertion that England ‘do not have a cat in hell’s chance’ in the next World Cup seems a bit over the top when, in effect, they will only need to put three good 50-over displays together against decent opposition to win in Australia and New Zealand because of the World Cup’s flawed format. Cook proved Mike Atherton wrong when he was labelled a ‘plodder and a donkey’ after becoming one-day captain three years ago. Now, starting at the Swalec Stadium, he has the chance to do the same to Swann and Vaughan. Had his say: Vaughan admits Cook proved him wrong but says England's one-day game is unncessary .

"By . Larry Fleisher, Associated Press . Gennady Golovkin was a hit in his first appearance at Madison Square Garden. If Golovkin has his way, he will get another attempt at fighting in the big arena against another Madison Square Garden regular - Miguel Cotto. Golovkin easily retained his WBA middleweight championship on Saturday night, stopping Australia's Daniel Geale at 2:47 of the third round in front of 8,572 fans. Belting performance: Gennady Golovkin celebrates his knockout win against Daniel Geale in New York . Game over: Golovkin knocked Australian boxer Geale out in the third round at Madison Square Garden . 'It's the biggest name that will get in the ring with him,' said Tom Loeffler of K2 promotions. 'That's our target. Miguel had a victory. He and Gennady Golovkin would be the biggest fight in the Garden and it's a unification fight.' 'I want to fight him next and prove to the world without a doubt that I'm the best middleweight in the world,' Golovkin said about Cotto, who has fought nine times at Madison Square Garden. 'That is very important to me.' Seven weeks after Cotto stopped Sergio Martinez in the 10th round for the WBC middleweight title, Golovkin was even more impressive. Golovkin improved to 30-0 with his 17th straight knockout and 27th overall, giving him a knockout rate of 90 percent - the highest in middleweight history. Next up: The Kazakh now wants to face WBC champion Miguel Cotto in a middleweight unification bout . he end came with a series of shots in the corner late in the third. After taking a shot from Geale, Golovkin struck with a right hand to the nose and followed with a left hand. That sent Geale to the canvas and referee Michael Ortega stopped the fight. 'It was a big step fighting in the arena and I'm happy to be performing for the fans,' Golovkin said. 'I was patient in the first round and part of the second. This is my style but once I figured him out, I was able to attack aggressively. I knew it was a matter of time. 'It was difficult to time Geale because he was coming in and out,' trainer Abel Sanchez said. 'Gennady hit him with a perfect left-right (combination) and the fight was over.' By the time Golovkin finished off his 11th title defence, Geale had already been bloodied in the right eye. That came about midway through the second round. 'I don't think there's anyone at 160 who can go 12 rounds with Gennady,' said Geale's trainer, Gary Shaw. 'I think that knockout streak will go on for a long time. Golovkin also nearly won the fight early in the second round. Less than 30 seconds into the round, Golovkin used a combination along the ropes that caused Geale to fall down. That came after Beale slipped with 18 seconds remaining in the opening round and that round inadvertently went four minutes. Geale (30-3), a former unified middleweight titleholder lost for the second time in three fights. He also lost to England's Darren Barker last August in Atlantic City, New Jersey. 'Golovkin's really quick and I think I fell into a couple of his traps,' Geale said. 'I was disappointed in myself. Things were going right early on. I guess that's what happens when you relax a little bit. I got caught.' Close call: Bryant Jennings beat Mike Perez by split decision in a co-featured bout . Rough justice: Perez's trainer Adam Booth claimed his man won the fight by three rounds . In the co-featured bout, Bryant Jennings (19-0) won a controversial split decision over Mike Perez (20-1-1) in a WBC eliminator heavyweight fight. Jennings became the mandatory challenger for the WBC heavyweight championship vacated by longtime champion Vitali Klitschko in December and his next fight will be either Bermane Stiverne or Deontay Wilder. 'He wouldn't trade with me,' Jennings said. 'I wanted him to stand in there with me and fight. I was expecting the inside pressure and it didn't happen.' Judges Glenn Feldman and Joe Pasquale had Jennings winning by scores of 114-113 and 115-112, respectively. Tom Schreck had Perez winning by a 114-113 margin. Perez wound losing a point with about a minute and a half remaining in the 12th after withstanding an early flurry by Jennings.

But we'll have a look in the morning and just make sure he's ready to go. 'We've got to give him as much opportunity as he needs. He's an important player for us. I'm pretty confident he'll be okay. If he plays, he will be fit.' Powell insists the club have carried out all the relevant medical checks and says Huby himself will help make the final decision. 'It's me and him.' said Powell. 'We've done all that, there's no major issues from that point of view. 'He's got to be confident that he can deliver his best performance and, if he tells me that he is and I see him do a couple of things in the morning, then we'll go with that.' Recovery: Huby dislocated his elbow less than two weeks ago but may recover in time for Saturday's final . Leeds coach Brian McDermott, who named his team at the start of the week, expects Huby to play. 'I think he's got a chance,' McDermott said. 'He's dislocated his elbow, which to your average man in the street means a number of months off. 'But it looked like it went back in. (They will) strap it up and put some injections in it.

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . Johnny Sexton is expected to complete a four-year deal to return from France to former club Leinster at the end of the coming season. Ireland fly-half Sexton is understood to have rejected a new contract offer from current club Racing Metro. The 29-year-old will hand Ireland a big Rugby World Cup boost if he returns to Leinster next summer, falling back under IRFU control. Coming home: Johnny Sexton looks set to return to Leinster from Racing Metro at the end of 2014-15 season . Unsettled: Sexton had option of a third year and Racing wanted him to stay longer but he is not happy in France . Head coach Joe Schmidt lamented Ireland's lack of influence over Sexton last season, with the Kiwi fearing his star playmaker had been overworked by Paris club Racing. Schmidt and Ireland will enjoy full access to British and Irish Lions star Sexton should he complete his anticipated Leinster return. Sexton had the option of staying for a third year in France, but the French Top 14 club were keen for him to sign a new long-term contract. The 45-cap fly-half had admitted struggling to settle to life in France after his move away from Ireland last season. Sexton remains Ireland's sole front-line star plying his trade abroad. Return: Sexton left Leinster at the end of the 2013 season but he is set to return to the province next year . Control: The IRFU will be able to control Sexton's availability and selection once he returns to Ireland . The IRFU fended off the lures of big money contracts in France last season, tying down the likes of Sean O'Brien, Jamie Heaslip, Conor Murray and Donnacha Ryan, with captain and talisman Paul O'Connell signing a new contract too. Leinster's Rob Kearney and Munster skipper Peter O'Mahony will be chief among those whose contracts expire at the end of the coming season. Sexton's move to France was expected to herald a host of team-mates following suit. The IRFU headed that off at the pass, and will seek to capitalise on Sexton's impending return to convince another clutch of out-of-contract stars to stay put. Sexton's troubles at Racing were well-documented last term, the outside-half called on to play 13 matches in 12 weeks, causing a hamstring tweak to threaten his involvement in Ireland's autumn Test series. Frustrated: Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt was annoyed he could not control Sexton's selection last year .","Sexton expected to complete four-year deal to return to Irish side Leinster .

"By . Chris Foy for the Daily Mail . Follow @@FoyChris . They thronged Wheldon Road in their thousands, adorned in replica shirts and scarves, waving flags as the Tigers emerged from The Jungle for their historic journey south. It was a fittingly raucous send-off. Castleford haven’t been to Wembley for 22 years, so when the coach carrying players and staff left their ground on Thursday, it was as if half of the West Yorkshire town had come along to wave them on their way. They crawled through the crowds before heading for the M1 and London. Challenge Cup fever was plain to see ahead of Saturday’s clash with big-city neighbours Leeds. The British sporting staple of haves versus have-nots had captured the imagination of the public. These Tigers may go into the showpiece fixture as underdogs, but they will have close to 25,000 fans urging them to upset the odds at the home of English football. VIDEO: Castleford fans get ready for the team's Challenge Cup final . Rugby fever: Proud Castleford supporters gear up for Saturday's Challenge Cup final . Do us proud boys: Castleford fans wave off their heroes as they head to London for the showpiece match . Half a mile from The Jungle, all along Carlton Street, stalls had been set up to sell ‘Cas’ merchandise, with traders converging from around the country. There were T-shirts announcing the ‘Wembley invasion 2014’. An opticians had mannequins dressed in team shirts, the indoor market had a ‘Tigers fun day’ in full swing and a bank had stickers in the windows. Cafes and houses were decorated with black and gold bunting. Anticipation was tangible. At the official club shop, they had run out of Castleford kits for the first time ever — with the white away shirt selling well as it is the one the players will wear today, as their triumphant predecessors did in 1969-70. Reaching this final is worth £300,000 to the Tigers and victory would bring a further £70,000, along with prestige, enhanced ticket sales, profile and interest. Rivals: Tigers' Michael Shenton and Leeds Rhinos' Kevin Sinfield pose with the prestigious trophy . On their way to Wembley: Excitement has been building in Catstleford before the Challenge Cup final . But that is merely a small part of the story. A club and a town forced to endure tough times in recent years have cause for renewed optimism. Steve Gill  took over as chief executive last year and the plight of the Tigers left him struggling with depression before an upturn in fortunes on and off the field this season. Castleford (from): Dixon, Shenton (capt), Webster, Carney, Dorn, Sneyd, Lynch, Milner, Huby, Hauraki, Massey, Clark, Holmes, Mariano, Wheeldon, Ellis, Finn, Jewitt, Carvell.

TV: LIVE on BBC1 from 2.30pm (kick-off 3pm). Referee: Phil Bentham . Venue: Wembley Stadium . Today is when the revival becomes real. ‘We’ve had some big games when we’ve won promotion back into Super League — in 2005 and 2007 — but the big one for the fans is the Wembley game,’ said Gill. ‘It is a showpiece of the sport on one of the best stages in the world. For us to get there is fantastic for the town and the club.’ Asked what the Tigers represent to the people of Castleford, Gill added: ‘This means everything to them. We were a mining town and a lot of people here lost their jobs in the industry. I was a miner, I did 22 years underground, and we were proud of our colliery — the whole town was proud of it. It meant a lot to us; to work hard and look after each other, and those values are part of the rugby club in Castleford. It is ours, it is a family and it is an integral part of the community. You beauty: Castleford's Frankie Mariano celebrates the team's Challenge Cup semi-final win against Widnes . The gaffer: Tigers Head Coach Daryl Powell stands next to the trophy that he hopes to lift on Saturday . ‘Everything we do has an impact on the town. We make people’s lives a lot easier when we win and everyone feels it when we lose. I haven’t felt that same sense of community here since the miners went on strike in 1985. On Saturday, we’re asking the last person out of here to turn off the lights.’ Kellingley, the last colliery in the area, was recently earmarked for closure, which will once again have a negative impact on the local workforce, but for now rugby league is providing a welcome distraction. Win or lose today, the Tigers will enjoy a civic reception in Castleford on Monday, then resume their attempts to reach the Super League play-offs. Earlier this season, coach Daryl Powell’s players agreed a self-imposed alcohol ban, as another means of committing themselves fully to the quest for a first major title since the old Regal Trophy was won in 1994. Physical: Castleford will need to play with determination to get the better of Leeds on Saturday . On Tuesday this week, the current squad were addressed by Malcolm Reilly, the decorated coach of the successful 1986 team and a player in the fabled 1970 side. Powell is the obvious link between the teams, as one of the Rhinos side who claimed this prize in 1999. Since then, Leeds have been to six finals and lost the lot. Captain Kevin Sinfield has been in five of those defeats. ‘We don’t have a bad record apart from the finals,’ he said. ‘We’re desperate to win. I feel very fortunate to have played at Wembley and to get another shot is really special.’ There can be no doubting the motivation for Leeds, but for Castleford the long wait for this pilgrimage to the capital and the difficulties they have endured adds greater resonance. As the club await planning permission for a proposed new stadium, Gill said: ‘We’ve been lucky to survive, now it is our time to thrive.’ Up for the cup: Castleford has been given a lift by the club's unexpected cup run .","Castleford supporters gathered in their thousands to wave the team off .

"By . Pa Reporter . Hunter Mahan produced a near flawless final round to clinch a two-shot victory in the opening FedEx Cup play-off at The Barclays in New Jersey. Mahan rose to the occasion on the back nine, with five birdies moving him steadily up the leaderboard and he could even afford to bogey the last, his only blemish of an otherwise fantastic display. A closing six-under 65 saw him finish comfortably ahead of American compatriot Cameron Tringale and Australian duo Stuart Appleby and Jason Day, who was joint overnight leader. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mahan delighted with hard fought win . Happy family: Hunter Mahan celebrates with his wife Kandi and daughter Zoe after winning at The Barclays .

Peaking at the right time: Mahan rediscovered his form at the perfect time ahead of Ryder Cup selection . VIDEO Mahan delighted with hard fought win . It was Mahan's sixth victory on the PGA Tour, and his first since April 2012, and puts him in an enviable position to claim the 10million US dollars (£6million) bonus that comes with winning the FedEx Cup. 'This is a FedEx Cup play-off event, this is where all the best players are. You need to peak your game and play some great golf and to do it on a Sunday like I did and hit some great shots and big putts down the end feels great,' he said. 'I felt good in the last few weeks. I felt like I turned a corner from myself and refocused myself on doing the right things. 'It feels great to get a 'W'.' Victory: The round sealed a first Tour victory for Mahan since 2012 by two shots from Day, Tringale and Appleby . With nine players having already qualified for America's Ryder Cup team, Mahan's effort this weekend may go a long way to earning a wildcard spot in Tom Watson's team for the event in Gleneagles next month. The 32-year-old from California has made two appearances for the United States but missed out on selection two years ago. However, he made it clear he would welcome a wildcard spot. 'It's the goal of every American and European player to play in the Ryder Cup. It means so much to us on both sides,' he added on Sky Sports 4. 'It's such a great competition that everyone loves to play against one another. It brings out the best in everyone. It'd be a huge bonus to be a part of the team.' Solid: Although his winning streak came to an end, Rory McIlroy's 70 did secure him a tie of 22nd place . Mahan started brightly with two birdies in his opening five holes but a run of five successive pars left his chances of glory floundering. He exploded into life from the 11th, however, with a run of five birdies in seven holes, and his putt on the 17th, 21ft from the pin, brought the crowd to their feet. A poor tee shot at his final hole kept them on the edge of their seats and he was lucky to avoid a bunker on his approach, with the ball nestling in the rough just above the sand. While he was unable to save par, he did hold his nerve to hole a tricky putt. Out: Lee Westwood finished the tournament level par but will not qualify for the second play-off . Day needed an eagle on the last to enforce a play-off but he too found the rough with his tee shot and with that his hopes vanished, settling for joint second after a closing 68. Fellow Australian Appleby also finished on 12 under for the tournament after matching Mahan's round, with Tringale carding a closing 66. World number one Rory McIlroy finished in a tie for 22nd after a one-under 70, while England's Lee Westwood was among the 25 players to fail to qualify for the second play-off event at the Deutsche Bank Championship, despite finishing level par for the tournament after a closing 70.","Mahan cards a 65 to win in New Jersey .

"By . Marcus Townend, Racing Correspondent . A clutch of top Flat jockeys escaped costly bans on Monday after the Starter and Advance Recall Flag man were blamed for a false-start, void-race fiasco at rain-lashed Epsom. Eight riders, including Ryan Moore and James Doyle, potentially faced a penalty which would have ruled them out of the final Classic, the St Leger at Doncaster. But Epsom stewards decided that the reason for the failure for the jockey to respond to a false start in the third-race, the Totepool Supporting The Sport You Love Handicap in which Humidor passed the post first, lay with officials. Fiasco: James Doyle leads Humidor to victory after eight runners ignored a false start at Epsom on Monday . While the Advance Flagman, responding to the Starter, waved his yellow Flag when Taurus Twins broke the stalls early, he took steps to his right and the jockeys claimed the did not see him with visibility poor. He also failed to blow his whistle as is required by the rules. As the operating procedures were not followed, the stewards decided that no action would be taken against the riders. A report was forwarded to the British Horseracing Authority. While some bookmakers stuck to their void race rules by re-funding stakes, others decided to pay out on the result.","Eight runners completed the five furlongs despite a false start being called .

"By . Marcus Townend, Racing Correspondent . Apprentice Louis Steward made the most of his biggest ever opportunity when landing the £265,000 Betfred Ebor on Mutual Regard at York. The 19-year-old jockey, based with trainer Michael Bell in Newmarket, was called up by winning trainer Johnny Murtagh to step in for suspended Ross Coakley after catching the eye of owner Andrew Tinkler. After he had driven 20-1 shot Mutual Regard to a length and a quarter win from Van Percy, five-pound claimer Steward said: ‘I ran through the race in my mind a thousand times thinking what if. I am still in shock.’ Concentration: Apprentice Louis Steward, riding  Mutual Regard, managed to take York's Ebor event . Trophy kiss: Steward celebrates after winning the Betfred Open at York on Saturday . Murtagh, who never won the Ebor during his distinguished career as a jockey, could now aim Mutual Regard at the Melbourne Cup in November. He said: ‘This lad had been going well at home. He got put up 11lb for winning first time out and I ran him in a Group Three last time and he ran a nice race behind Pale Mimosa (who won the Lonsdale Cup on Friday). ‘Ascot might be on his agenda now, but we'll see about the Melbourne Cup as he loves fast ground.’ High hopes: Trainer Johnny Murtagh (pictured taking the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge with Steward) wants Mutual Regard to ride at the Melbourne Cup in November . Elidor was third while the heavily-backed 9-2 favourite Pallasator ran a big race to be fourth from his wide draw in stall 22, which meant he had to be dropped in almost last on leaving the gates. He was almost last entering the home straight and the energy he expelled reaching a challenging position under jockey Luke Morris eventually told. Ironically, Mutual Regard used to be trained by Pallasator’s handler Sir Mark Prescott. He was bought by Tinkler out of the Prescott stable for 60,000gn at last October’s Horses In Training Sales.","Suspended jockey Ross Coakley replaced by apprentice Louis Steward .

"By . Sam Webb . The picture, of four Chinese officials meeting a 103-year-old woman in her home, was probably meant to convey the impression of a government in touch with the masses. The image, from Ningguo in eastern China, even bore the caption: 'Love and consideration for the elderly is a cherished Chinese tradition. They should feel the warmth of the party and the government.' However, the media stunt backfired spectacularly as the image was an ineptly edited montage that exposed all involved to ridicule from China's increasingly vocal online commentators. Utterly bizarre: This poorly manipulated image was released by Chinese officials keen to highlight their concern for the elderly . A close-up of the manipulated area. The woman looks like a doll and the officials torso hovers in mid-air . Four grinning men tower above centenarian Cheng Yanchun, who has obviously been edited into the photo from another image but appears almost doll-sized. One of the party officials has been chopped off at the thigh to incorporate the image, leaving him bizarrely hanging in mid-air. Chinese users of Weibo, a micro-blog site, were not impressed. 'The brainless propaganda staff will probably be sacked along with these officials,' said one. Another added: 'This picture really shows the distance between leaders and commoners in the eyes of your average government official. Very sad and depressing.' Another photo of the visit: The government has apologised for the picture, saying the photographer had struggled to get everyone at the event into the frame . Even Xinhua, China’s official news agency, put the boot in. 'The officials appear to be floating in the air. In addition the woman’s proportions do not match those of the officials indicating that the photo may have been faked,' it reported. Officials told The Honk Kong Standard that they had visited centenarians during a Chinese festival, but an employee had merged two shots because the layout of the room had prevented the photographer from capturing the woman and the officials in the same frame. 'Cheng was sitting on a chair on the balcony, under the sun. The balcony space was very small and the camera lens could not cover the whole scene… When the employee of the municipal civil affairs department uploaded the photos … he simply merged two shots,' the government said. 'We express deep regret to internet users for its negative influence… We will learn from the experience, to improve civil affairs work.'

"By . John Greechan for MailOnline . Celtic boss Ronny Deila insists he has no doubts over Virgil van Dijk’s continued commitment to the club despite wrecking the central defender’s dream of a deadline-day move to the Barclay’s Premier League. Deila left van Dijk out of the starting XI for their 1-1 draw with Dundee at Dens Park after telling the Dutchman he would be going nowhere despite interest from Newcastle, Sunderland and Swansea. ‘He had of course wishes to get to a new stage,’ said Deila, who remains positive about landing Serbian striker Stefan Scepovic despite fears of a last-minute hitch. ‘He is a young player and a young man - and he will get many chances in his career. But now we need we need him here and he knows that and that is how it is going to be. Disappointment: Virgil van Dijk was incredibly disappointed not to seal a move to the Premeir League . ‘I think it’s no problem. But he needs a couple of days to get this out of his system, get thinking positive again. ‘He’s a player we want to have and we would like to sign him on an even longer contract. That’s how it is. We need good players here and we need to have his kind of player if we want to get the results we need. So that is no problem, that is how it is.’ Asked outright if he worried about the commitment of a player with declared designs on a move, Deila said: ‘No. He is professional. There are a lot of emotions, a lot of thinking, and not so much sleep. The speculation is hard for the mind. It will be good when we come back after the break. ‘I am 100 per cent sure (that he will be committed).’ Training: Van Dijk is still training but missed the match against Dundee as he was not in the right frame of mind . Invited to explain whether he or the player had decided on his omission from a team struggling defensively, the manager said: ‘We talked about it. When you are not 100 per cent at Celtic you can’t play. Then other players can do a better job and that is how it is. ‘There has been a lot of speculation and a lot of thinking for him. He is a very important player for us, a very good player – and we have told him that there is no chance he is going to leave. ‘He is too important to us, so there is no chance we will let him go during this window. We couldn’t replace him. So he is going to stay here. ‘Of course it’s hard for him and he’s had a lot of thinking to do. But it will not be a problem. ‘His girlfriend is also pregnant and due soon. So he hasn’t had the right focus, he wouldn’t have been 100 per cent today – that is why he didn’t play.’ Reports in Spain insisted that Sporting Gijon striker Scepovic, who has passed a medical after the clubs agreed a fee, was prepared to spend today waiting to see if a better offer came in from elsewhere. Committed: Ronny Delia said he had no doubts as regarding Van Dijk's commitment to the club . But Deila declared: ‘No that’s not my understanding of it. He wants to play for Celtic .That’s a good start. ‘We hope that that can be arranged. We are working hard now every day to get that done. ‘I think the process is ongoing. It’s paperwork all over, things have to be settled 100 per cent before we can go out with anything. ‘Will anyone else come in? We’ll see. Things can happen. We are working all the time to see what the options are.’ Asked about persistent whispers of a bid for Dundee United midfielder Stuart Armstrong before the transfer window closes, Deila said: ‘No...I can’t comment.’ Europa League: Celtic missed out on Champions League qualification after losing to Maribor . He was more adamant about the prospect of Leigh Griffiths going on loan, saying: ‘He is going to stay as well. No players are going out, it is important to get people fit and players back from injury, get the new players in and back from injury and get them playing matches so we have a strong and good squad for the fantastic games we are going to have after the next 14 days.’ Deila was disappointed that his team conceded after just a minute yesterday, saying: ‘That was a very poor start – I think we looked afraid and we lacked energy. That lasted for quite a while. ‘I am not very concerned by the results. Now we get ten days away from each other, because almost the entire squad is going away with their national teams. ‘It is a possibility for them to get their heads around something else, also play more matches. When they come back, we will know who is going to be here – and who is not going to be here. ‘We can start working with the squad we have, new players will come in and we will be more fit, as well. So we will be a stronger squad and stronger team after the international break.’","Virgil van Dijk is committed to Celtic, says manager Ronny Delia .

"By . John Greechan for MailOnline . Rangers are once again flirting with financial meltdown – after the board admitted that they’ll be unable to meet the demands of creditors unless a new £4million share issue succeeds. Despite repeated official denials of any imminent threat of a second administration, the club lodged an open offer with the Stock Exchange on Thursday, inviting existing shareholders to buy new shares at 20 pence each. And the club warned that, unless they raise at least £3million, the offer will not proceed – adding: ‘Should this occur, the Company will be unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the Company will be uncertain; The Directors will immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available.’ Disarray: Rangers face an uncertain future if they cannot raise at least £3million . Aiming for promotion: Rangers have claimed six points from their opening three games . That statement comes despite the board insisting that they have over £4million in the bank – and alongside promises to invest heavily in the club’s bid to return to a position of dominance in the Scottish game. In a sign of how deep the crisis runs, the official statement to shareholders, outlining grand plans to raise up to £30million in the next three years, revealed that the club needed this fundraising exercise to help repay the £1.5million emergency loan taken out earlier this year. The statement read: ‘On 23 February 2014, the Company announced that it had entered into two secured short term credit facilities for an aggregate amount of up to £1.5million. 'These credit facilities are due for repayment on 1 September 2014 and the Board is in discussions with the providers in relation to their repayment, part of which will come from the proceeds of the Open Offer. ‘The Board has developed and approved a strategic plan as part of the Business Review to re-build and re-establish the Club, to return it to the top of the domestic game within three seasons, and to thereafter be competitive in UEFA competition. This will require continued investment in the playing squad over the next three years and beyond to drive on-field success. ‘In order to achieve this, the Company will need to raise capital over the next three years. It expects to raise between £20 million and £30 million. The Open Offer is an important planned part of this fund raising strategy and will provide the Club with working capital and part of the repayment to George Letham and Alexander Easdale of the £1.5million drawn down from the credit facilities provided by them to the Company.’ Worrying times: Rangers manager Ally McCoist be keeping a close eye on his side's financial worries .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is one of the few certainties of air travel. You can normally assume that – after all the ticket checks and security procedures – if you are allowed onto an aircraft, it is the plane that will be taking you to your destination. 'Traumatised': Stacey McGuinness found herself at the wrong airport . But this was not the case for a Scottish holidaymaker who found herself 300 miles from home last week after low-cost carrier Jet2 dropped her in the wrong country. This mistake led to red faces at the airline – and a long taxi ride for the weary tourist. Stacey McGuinness, 27, from Dundee, had just enjoyed a ten-day break in Turkey with her family. She was due to fly home from Dalaman, in the south-west of Turkey, on Friday – and was booked onto the 11.05pm Jet2 flight to Glasgow. Three hours later, she found herself not just at the wrong airport, but in the wrong country, after the plane landed at Leeds-Bradford Airport. The confusion began at Dalaman Airport. ‘The screen said to go to gate 33 for the flight to Glasgow,’ Ms McGuinness says. ‘But when I went to the desk it said Leeds-Bradford.’ ‘When I asked at the desk, they said “this is the right one”. ‘I asked them to check again just before we boarded, but they still said I was in the right place. ‘I got to my seat fine. The plane was quite empty anyway.’ Despite the assurances that she was on the right flight, Stacey's nightmare situation was confirmed when the captain told the passengers they were just one hour from touching down in England. Forced to apologise: Budget airline Jet2 put Stacey McGuinness onto the wrong flight at Dalaman Airport . When the plane landed, Stacey met a Jet2 manager, who apologised for the mistake. Her luggage was nowhere to be seen. The airline decided to call for a taxi to take her on a five-hour journey back to Dundee. But Stacey said the gesture was not enough. She still hasn't received her baggage, and she wants compensation for her whole ordeal. ‘The manager said it shouldn't have happened, and that I could have been a terrorist or anything’ she says. ‘He ordered me a taxi all the way back to Dundee, and the taxi driver did not want the journey at all. ‘I got back in the end, but all my clothes and valuables are in my suitcase that I still haven't got back, and the customer services are telling me nothing.' Jet2 have been unable to comment on the issue of how she ended up on the wrong flight. Not even close: The holidaymaker wanted to go to Glasgow, but found herself at Leeds-Bradford Airport . However, they have said that Ms McGuinness's luggage will be returned to her today. A spokeswoman for Jet2 said: ‘Ms McGuinness's baggage has arrived with us and will be delivered today. Jet2 apologises for the inconvenience.’ Stacey, who lives in Douglas, a suburb of Dundee, says: ‘I asked twice if I was in the right place, and each time they said that I was. ‘I still can't believe what has happened. 'I won't be travelling with Jet2 again. I'm scared to even fly at all now. ‘I was on my own, which made it worse. I was really traumatised.’","Stacey McGuinness wanted to fly to Glasgow, but landed at Leeds-Bradford .

Mackay since apologised  but caused further controversy after describing two racist text messages, which he admits he sent, as 'friendly text message banter'.

Tan launched a £750,000 investigation, conducted by law firm Mishcon de Reya. The series of deeply offensive text messages were discovered during a raid on Moody’s London home in March. Mackay issued a poorly-worded statement through the League Managers’ Association. ‘In the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one-line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures,’ said the statement. ‘These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.’ Disgraced: Malky Mackay is being investigated by the Football Association about text messages .

It is understood that Mackay was sat on a table with former Labour Party leader and Cardiff City supporter Neil Kinnock. VIDEO Scroll down for Malky Mackay supervises training at former club Cardiff . Attendance: Malky Mackay was present at Kick It Out's 20th anniversary dinner only three months ago . Reported: Mackay is being investigated by The FA . On that evening, Martin Luther King III, the eldest son of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. took to the stage to address the audience. King said at the dinner: ‘People must stand up against racism. We know what we should do, we know what we must do, but we just have to identify the will - when ability and will meet then results occur.’ Mackay has often spoken positively of the anti-discrimination organisation. Fan favourite: Mackay was hugely popular in Wales, the fans were outraged when he was let go by Vincent Tan . Matt Lawton's story that shook football . In 2012, he said: ‘The chairman [Lord Herman Ouseley] of the ‘Kick It Out’ campaign has been championing kicking racism out of our sport for years and is trying his damnedest to make this work, as have a lot of people. ‘People have got opinions but to stand as one block and try and fight against it is the best way.’ Following an educational workshop for local children in 2011, the then Cardiff manager Mackay was quoted as saying: ‘As a Football Club we unite as one against racism. ‘Football is a game followed by all and should an enjoyable experience, whatever their racial or ethnic background. We all have a role in stopping racism in sport, and society in general.’ Positive: Former Cardiff City boss Mackay (right) has spoken regularly of his admiration for Kick It Out . The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.","Mackay is currently under investigation by The FA for 'racist, sexist and homphobic messages'

That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.","Sporting director Iain Moody resigned from his post on Wednesday .

"By . Chris Waugh . Barcelona have had their appeal against a two-window transfer ban rejected by FIFA following a hearing on Wednesday. The Spanish giants will be barred from signing players in the next two transfer windows - taking them through until January 2016 - after breaching transfer conditions to do with 'the protection of minors'. But the club have confirmed that they will now take their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in order to have the ban overturned.

Unveliing: Luis Suarez was presented as a Barcelona player on Tuesday but the Catalans have now failed with their bid to have his appeal for biting overturned and have their two-window transfer embargo lifted . New man: Thomas Vermaelen is one of five players to have moved to the Nou Camp this summer . Just days after hearing that Luis Suarez would not have his ban for biting reduced - though the forward is now allowed to train with the club and made his debut in a friendly on Monday - the Catalans once again attempted to plead their case for leniency. A club statement read: 'Regarding the resolution handed today by FIFA's appeal committee with regards to the transfer and registrations of players under 18, FC Barcelona announces that it will continue to defend its interests to the highest sporting legal court, in this case the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). 'FC Barcelona cannot agree in any way with the resolution that goes against the spirit of our Masia (Barcelona's youth academy), an example of academic, human and sporting development, recognised worldwide.' FIFA announced in April that Barca would be unable to sign any players for two transfer windows due to the 'international transfer of minors', but the Spanish giants immediately appealed the decision. That caused their embargo being indefinitely postponed - leading to the signing of five players this summer. The most notable arrival was the £75million acquisition of Suarez from Liverpool.

"By . Sami Mokbel for the Daily Mail . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . It's Chelsea, but not as we know it. Dynamic, inventive and exuberant, Jose Mourinho’s new-look team have ripped up their overused ‘How to win’ manual and begun work on a new book. With Cesc Fabregas as the author, the latest chapter in Chelsea Football Club’s meteoric rise looks sure to make compelling reading. The London club lived up to their billing as early-season title favourites with a tantalising display of attacking football in Monday’s 3-1 win at Burnley. It was breathtaking at times — Andre Schurrle’s goal alone was worth the entrance money. VIDEO Scroll down to see new Chelsea signings Fabregas and Costa score brilliant goals . Dream team: Jose Mourinho has constructed a new-look Chelsea side in his second coming at the Bridge . The silk: Chelsea's side have the creative passing characteristics of Barcelona . ... and the steel: The Blues also have the physical resilience of Wimbledon's Crazy Gang . With 37 games games still to go you will struggle to see an assist as delicious as Fabregas’s to set up the German World Cup winner for Chelsea’s second of the night. We wondered if Fabregas could still cut it in England. In that moment, we got the answer. His two debut assists were merely the icing on the cake, though. It was the way he dictated Chelsea’s play and tempo that caught the eye. Of course, his nine years at Arsenal helped; there will be no settling in period for him. His sixth sense of when to inject pace into Chelsea’s passing or take the foot off the gas was all too apparent at Turf Moor. You just wonder what Arsene Wenger, or even David Moyes, were thinking when watching the Spaniard’s display. And in Nemanja Matic, Fabregas has a midfield monster of a partner who can provide him with the platform to cause destruction. Beauty: Cesc Fabregas' exquisite passing orchestrated play from midfield . ... and the Beast: Nemanja Matic offered a perfect foil for Cesc Fabregas with his tough tackling . Mourinho said: ‘Fabregas and Matic controlled the game, the intensity of the game, they were choosing how to play; when to increase pace and decrease pace. ‘Last season we couldn’t control the game in the way we controlled it today. Fabreags was our first choice for that position. I know clearly the player he is because we have spent so many years in the same league, here in England, then he moved to Spain. ‘He’s giving exactly what we need, that stability, that quick thinking in midfield, the right intensity of the game. He brings other people in the same direction.’ Striker light: Jose Mourinho did not select a true No 9 in his first away game last season . German engineering: Andre Schurrle scored the goal of the night after a through ball from Cesc Fabregas . The counter-argument, of course, is that this was the first game of the season, against a newly-promoted team. And, yes, that should be taken into account. But the signs are ominous for the rest of the Premier League. Remember that attacking football and Chelsea haven’t always gone hand in hand. Too often they have relied on sheer power to get them over the line. Indeed, it was only this time last year when Mourinho took his side to Old Trafford and started the game without a recognised striker. Now, 12 months on, and Mourinho’s team look transformed. But that’s not to say Chelsea have forgotten how to rough it. Missing link: Spain international Diego Costa is the striker that Chelsea were missing last season . VIDEO Fabregas and Matic controlled the game - Mourinho . Diego Costa scored on his debut against Sean Dyche’s side but, perhaps, more importantly showed an appetite for a fight. John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Matic will not pull punches either. In many ways, it’s Roman Abramovich’s dream.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From Tiananmen Square to the Forbidden City, smog frequently shrouds China’s famous landmarks in a grey haze. But as well as ruining the view for tourists and posing a health risk for locals, the air pollution over Asia’s largest cities has been found to affect weather all over the world. A team of U.S. scientists discovered that aerosols created by humans in Asian economies impact storm formation in the U.S. and beyond. The almost hidden city: From Tiananmen Square to the Forbidden City (pictured), smog frequently shrouds China's famous landmarks in a grey haze and the air pollution has now been blamed for storms further afield . Smog greeted Formula One teams in Shanghai for the forthcoming Chinese Grand Prix this weekend. It was uncertain that the practice was going to go ahead as factories in town and car exhaust fumes contributed to 214micrograms per cubic metre - three times the national limit. The US Consulate warned that people with ‘heart or lung disorders, older adults and children, should avoid all physical activity’ outdoors, while healthy adults should still avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. The particles are dangerous as they can go deep into the lungs. The race is thought to be unaffected, particularly because factories will shut over the weekend. Pollutants frequently reach dangerous levels in Beijing while emissions in Delhi often exceed the World Health Organisation’s recommended levels, which affect the health of people in the cities. Scientists compared air pollution rates from 1850 to 2000 and found that man-made particles from Asia impact the Pacific storm track that can influence weather over much of the world. A team from Texas A&M University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the University of California at San Diego and Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) used detailed pollution emission data compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and looked at two scenarios: one for a rate in 1850 before the Industrial era and one from 2000. By comparing the results from a global climate model, the team found that aerosols impact cloud formations and mid-latitude cyclones associated with the Pacific storm track. Blanketed: A thick haze shrouds eastern China. Aerosol particles from Asia affect storms sweeping across the Pacific and subsequently the weather patterns in North America and the rest of the world, the scientists said . ‘There appears to be little doubt that these particles from Asia affect storms sweeping across the Pacific and subsequently the weather patterns in North America and the rest of the world,' said Renyi Zhang, a previous researcher at Texas A&M University and employee at JPL. ‘The climate model is quite clear on this point. The aerosols formed by human activities from fast-growing Asian economies do impact storm formation and global air circulation downstream. ‘They tend to make storms deeper and stronger and more intense, and these storms also have more precipitation in them.  We believe this is the first time that a study has provided such a global perspective.’ In recent years, researchers have learned that atmospheric aerosols affect the climate, either directly by scattering or absorbing solar radiation, or indirectly by altering cloud formations. Could storm damage in the U.S. become a frequent occurrence? The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy is pictured. Researchers found that aerosols impact cloud formations and mid-latitude cyclones associated with the Pacific storm track . Increasing levels of such particles have raised concerns because of their potential impacts on regional and global atmospheric circulation. Dr Zhang said large amounts of aerosols and their long-term journey from Asia across the Pacific can clearly be seen by satellite images. The pacific storm track transports heat and moisture across the ocean and the scientists think it is intensified by the air flow of pollution generated in Asia. ‘Our results support previous findings that show that particles in the air over Asia tend to affect global weather patterns. It shows they can affect the Earth’s weather significantly,’ Dr Zhang said. Pollutants frequently reach dangerous levels in Beijing, China, while emissions in Delhi, India, often exceed the World Health Organisation's recommended levels, which affects the health of people in the cities.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Fernando Alonso has confirmed he and team-mate Kimi Raikkonen are pulling in the same direction in a bid to haul Ferrari back to the front of the Formula One grid. The return of Raikkonen to Ferrari, pitching two world champions together in the same team, was expected to produce fireworks and results. But there has been nothing sparkly about their relationship to date as the Finn has struggled for form, leaving Alonso to keep Ferrari in the hunt for podiums. Not working: Kimi Raikkonen (left) has been poor this season, placing a big burden on Fernando Alonso (right) Taking instructions: The pair receive a briefing before the Melbourne Grand Prix . Alonso and Raikkonen did at least conjure their best results this season last time out in Hungary before the sport's summer break, finishing second and sixth. Circumstances, however, dictated the result, which was no indicator as to a potential revival for the second half of the campaign which starts on Sunday with the Belgian Grand Prix. Alonso and Raikkonen both know they have a lot of work to do if Ferrari are to show signs over the closing eight races they can again be a force to be reckoned with in 2015. To that end, the duo are working hand in hand and Alonso said: 'We definitely work a lot together. Plenty to ponder: Alonso has seen Ferrari struggle this season, with team-mate Raikkonen out of form . 'The meetings have been quite long this year because we have had a lot of things to sort out after the races. 'We have been constantly making suggestions and comments about what we have on the track to try to help the engineers to transfer that to Maranello (factory) and to translate those comments into ideas for the car. 'It's not a big change compared to the way I used to work with Felipe (Massa) and any other team-mate. 'It's a working relationship to try to help the team all the time.' Happier times: Raikkonen (left) and Alonso (centre) celebrate a podium finish in the 2013 Chinese Grand Prix . Alonso has so far finished ahead of Raikkonen in all 11 races, and although he can point to longevity with the team as one reason behind such a statistic, the new regulations introduced at the start of the campaign should have provided more of a level playing field. Raikkonen, though, has not found the car to his liking at all, with Alonso adding: 'Obviously the car is not great. 'We lack downforce and traction, and we had difficulties with braking at the first couple of races, and other systems, that we had new this year. 'Kimi was probably not feeling confident with the car and he was not totally happy with the balance, but at the moment neither of us are super happy with the performance. 'All we can do is to try to keep improving to score more points because, up until the last race and especially with the constructors' championship, we were going backwards a little bit. 'We now need to put both cars in the points as many times as possible.'

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association Sport . Kevin Magnussen believes McLaren are a long way from a return to their glory days, although is convinced they are at least on the right track. With eight races of the season remaining, starting this Sunday with the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa as Formula One returns from its summer break, McLaren find themselves in the unaccustomed position of sixth in the constructors' championship. You have to go back to 1981 for when McLaren last finished a season in such a position, while it is now 21 months and 30 races since the team's last victory, their worst winless streak for 17 years. Back on track: Kevin Magnussen believes that McLaren are on a return to glory . That is not what Group chief executive Ron Dennis envisaged at the start of the year when he firmly suggested McLaren would win again. For Magnussen, from the high of finishing second on his debut in Australia, the remainder of the year has been a struggle for the rookie. Yet the 21-year-old Dane has every confidence if the team continue along the path they have been treading, they will again be back at the front. 'We're still some way off where we should be, which is McLaren dominating Formula One,' said Magnussen. 'But we just need to keep doing what we're doing at the moment, which is staying strong, positive and patient. 'For me, I'm on a very steep learning curve, a process of development as a Formula One driver. 'The goal for the next part of the season is to stay on that curve, to keep the development going, and for the team it's not that much different. Optimistic: Magnussen is in his first season as a F1 driver at the age of just 21 . 'We need to keep developing as we have been doing because we've done a really good job in catching up some of our rivals. 'I know we're not where we want to be but we have closed the gap to some really good competitors, and if we can keep that going then that would be a good plan.' Magnussen is mature enough to appreciate McLaren's situation, so when it comes to personal targets there is only one worth mentioning. 'I'm not really planning goals for myself,' added Magnussen. 'With where we are at the moment our goal should simply be just to win. 'Right now we're not in a position where we can expect to be winning every race, so we need to just have the one goal, which is getting back to winning again. 'Goals like top three or top five are not relevant. Until you win, you just have to get the most out of what you have, out of the situation.'

"By . Phil Medlicott, Press Association . Stoke defender Erik Pieters believes the club's current strength in depth means players will soon lose their places in the team if they are not performing up to scratch. The Potters have made six summer signings and, reporting he had a fully fit squad, manager Mark Hughes emphasised the point ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League opener at home against Aston Villa that several senior players he has every intention of retaining would not be able to feature. In the end, the likes of Robert Huth, Jon Walters and Steve Sidwell were unused substitutes, while Victor Moses, Peter Odemwingie, Geoff Cameron and Andy Wilkinson were among those not in the matchday 18. Battling display: Eric Pieters surges forward for Stoke during their defeat to Aston Villa . Stoke lost the contest 1-0 after Andreas Weimann netted in the 50th minute, and 26-year-old Holland full-back Pieters said of the hosts' performance: ""Of course you are disappointed to concede a goal. ""But it was early in the second half, so you have a lot of time to recover and get back into the game if you keep playing football. But we were just too sloppy. We weren't sharp enough. ""The thing is, we have a big squad now. Everyone knows that and you have to perform every week. ""If you don't it is simple - you are out. We have enough players to take your place in every position. It is good for the team."" Star villain: Andreas Weimann scores the winner for Aston Villa to give them an opening day win . Asked if he thought the new players needed more time to gel with their team-mates, Pieters added: ""I don't think they have time. ""It is the Premier League and you have to be there from the start. If you are not, then you have to look in the mirror and say you have to do better."" Stoke announced their latest new signing just prior to the Villa match, with Nigeria winger Moses - who was ineligible for the game - joining on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea. Hughes has subsequently indicated there will be no further additions to the squad in this transfer window and that ""one or two"" players could be departing. ""It's fair to say, I think our business is done now,"" Hughes said on www.stokecityfc.com. ""One or two players may be leaving the club but I don't envisage anyone else coming in. We're done now - it's a case of working with the group that we've got."" Flurry of signings: Victor Moses signed for Stoke on a season-long loan from Chelsea . Regarding 23-year-old Moses, Hughes said: ""We're very happy that Victor has come to the club. ""He's a player with a great deal of potential but he hasn't played as much football as he would have wanted to in recent years. ""He's desperate to play and that's why he has come to us. He's a good young player and will bring pace and power."" There has also been plenty of change at Villa, with Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez arriving on Friday as their most recent summer acquisition. At the same time as five new summer recruits coming into the picture, there have been personnel restored to first-team contention after long periods of not being involved, including defender Alan Hutton. As part of a determined display by Villa's defence on Saturday, Hutton was making his first competitive appearance under manager Paul Lambert after two seasons of being frozen out and playing on loan. And the 29-year-old Scotland international was delighted with how his ""second debut"" went. Reflecting on the victory, Hutton said: ""First and foremost you have to defend well, and to get a clean sheet was brilliant. All the boys are happy enough. ""It is unbelievable to come away from the Britannia Stadium with a win, being as hard a place as it is to get three points. ""And with it also being a second debut for myself, it was brilliant.

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Ronald Koeman walked into Anfield’s Press auditorium, looking completely deflated. After a summer of turmoil on the South Coast, he had to fulfil the duty — explaining a Southampton defeat — which many would have expected after his first game in charge. His deflation, though, had nothing to do with the hand that he had been dealt. There was no complaint about his club’s board or the absence of those influential former players who were sold for a king’s ransom this summer. No. Koeman was miserable because his team had to make the long journey home with nothing to show for their impressive efforts; their performance, full of spirit and tenacity, rattled a disjointed Liverpool and should have yielded at least a point. VIDEO Scroll down for Ronald Koeman: We created enough chances to get a result . Despair: Koeman insists his side were unlucky not to beat Liverpool having equalised in the second-half . Level: Clyne equalised for Southampton, and Koeman says his side played most of the football afterwards . Such has been the seismic change at St Mary’s, with five players leaving, a manager departing and a chairman quitting, that the vast majority of predictions in pre-season involved Southampton being included in the three names who will tumble out of the top flight next May. Koeman, however, does not subscribe to the opinion that relegation is a certainty — ‘have a bet with me about that and you will lose,’ he said before this trip to Merseyside — and nor should he on the basis of this effort. ‘Always there is one end to all of those stories,’ said Koeman, as he reflected on the sucker-punch goal from Daniel Sturridge that clinched Liverpool’s victory. ‘It is between the white lines of the pitch to show the people and, first, to show ourselves that we have to believe in our quality. Energetic: Ryan Bertrand impressed for Southampton at left-back, making up for Luke Shaw's departure . ‘That was one of the messages we gave the boys. We played an impressive second half and that is how we like to play. If we play like that, I don’t think we will struggle. The way we played (against Liverpool) I think brings us a lot of confidence.’ So it should. If it took them a while to find their stride, Southampton regularly began causing Liverpool headaches. All over the pitch, figures in dark blue caught the eye, from Jose Fonte, the best central defender on the pitch, to the terrific Nathaniel Clyne. In midfield James Ward-Prowse darted into dangerous areas and delivered a stream of impressive dead balls, Victor Wanyama was figure of muscular aggression, while Dusan Tadic showed enough flair to suggest that, at £10.9million, he could become a key figure. Talented: Dusan Tadic was instrumental for Southampton on his debut, setting up their only goal . Yet all those positives could not mask Koeman’s feelings. He had been at Anfield seven days earlier, along with his assistant Sammy Lee, to see Liverpool pummel Borussia Dortmund 4-0 but he had done his homework and it so nearly paid off. ‘We were unlucky but the final score makes the points,’ Koeman reflected. ‘At 1-1 one team on the pitch was playing and it was Southampton. We had a chance to score the second, two great opportunities, but the quality of Liverpool… that makes the difference.’ It was, ultimately, small details. If Simon Mignolet had not diverted Morgan Schneiderlin’s thumping 88th minute drive on the bar, Koeman’s belief would have been vindicated. As it is, he will have to wait for Saturday’s home date with West Brom to show why he has such faith.

"By . Pa Reporter . Liverpool have a new 'SAS' partnership up front after Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge saw off Southampton. The £75million sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona not only saw Liverpool's title credentials questioned, but ended his lethal partnership with Sturridge. Asked if Liverpool were stronger without Suarez, who scored 31 league goals for the Reds last season, Sturridge told Sky Sports 1: 'I think so, with the players we have brought in. No disrespect to Luis - he's a great player and he'll be missed - but we move on from that. All smiles: Daniel Sturridge believes Liverpool are stronger without Luis Suarez . Pastures new: Suarez joined Barcelona in a £75million deal this summer . World class: Suarez (left) scored 31 league goals for Liverpool last season . 'We have shown we can win games, score goals and defend as well. But with the little man (Sterling) and the other players producing the goods, we'll be okay.' The England striker did not look lost without Suarez on Sunday, as he and Sterling both scored in a 2-1 victory over Southampton. 'It's important as a collective unit that we all provide the goals, but it doesn't matter how many we get so long as we defend well and get the goals we need,' Sturridge added. Tucked away: Sturridge's second-half strike gave Liverpool a 2-1 win against Southampton . Brothers in arms: Sturridge (right) says him and Raheem Sterling (left) have a connection at Liverpool . 'I think with ourselves and the other boys, especially the ones the manager has brought in, with myself and Raheem we have a connection.

'I'm the older brother so I give him more stick than he gives me!' Their goals came either side of a Nathaniel Clyne equaliser, and Sturridge's in particular eased the nerves after the unfancied visitors came on strong. 'The first game is always difficult,' Sturridge added. 'The pace was high, we worked hard and controlled things, but when they got a goal it was difficult for us.

"By . Matt Morlidge for MailOnline . Follow @@MattMorlidge . Six players made their debuts as Liverpool hosted Southampton on Sunday, all looking to make an instant impact. Dejan Lovren was the most high profile, facing his former club, though Adam Lallana missed out on that same chance. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at who impressed and who faltered in their first game. LIVERPOOL . Javier Manquillo . Plenty of energy down the right-hand side, but was perhaps lucky to be let off in the lead up to Liverpool's opener. Had the tricky task of keeping Dusan Tadic quiet but didn't look out of place on his Premier League debut. Two-year loan may prove to be good, if not odd, business. VIDEO Scroll down to watch debutants Lovren for Liverpool and Tadic for Southampton . Energetic: Javier Manquillo got used to the physicallity of the Premier League straight away on his debut . Dejan Lovren . Provoked cheers and boos every time he touched the ball, looked at home at Anfield. A rugged centre-back whose instincts are to defend first and foremost, a rarity of late for a Liverpool defender. £20million may sound like a lot for a solid defender, but if David Luiz is worth £50m... Presence: Dejan Lovren provoked cheers and boos every time he touched the ball, and was solid in defence . Rickie Lambert . Emotional debut at Anfield for the 31-year-old, albeit from the substitute's bench. While his introduction may have culminated in Liverpool's winner, he didn't have enough time to truly make an impact. SOUTHAMPTON . Fraser Forster . £10m is a lot to spend on a goalkeeper but after Fraser Forster's displays for Celtic handed him a World Cup squad, there was no more sought-after stopper in England. Could do nothing about Raheem Sterling's goal, and made several solid saves as Liverpool dominated the first half. Glove specialist: Fraser Forster may turn out to be a coup for Southampton at £10m . Ryan Bertrand . Struggled early on in the first half as Philippe Coutinho, Manquillo and Jordan Henderson targeted the left-back. Grew into the game though, and should prove to be a fine replacement for Luke Shaw. Southampton knew what they were getting when they loaned Bertrand. A consistent, but young, performer who knows the Premier League inside out. Energetic: Ryan Bertrand impressed for Southampton at left-back, making up for Luke Shaw's departure . Dusan Tadic . The best of them all. Tadic showed plenty of promise in the first half and was always willing to take his man on, but failed to deliver at times. Come the second half the Serbian winger really showed what he was about. Drifting in from the left, his beautiful backheel flick set up Nathaniel Clyne's equaliser. Talented: Dusan Tadic was instrumental for Southampton on his debut, setting up their only goal . Graziano Pelle . Strikers who score plenty in Holland tend to struggle in England, and Pelle's start to life on these shores could certainly have been better. Looked languid up front, lacking movement, and was dealt with easily in the first period by Lovren. More impressive when midfielders and defenders ran off him, but never seemed likely to trouble Simon Mignolet directly. Static: Graziano Pelle's movement wasn't great on Sunday, he may turn out to be another flop from Holland . Shane Long . Thrown on when the going got tough, Long will hopefully have more time to help justify that £12m fee in the future for the Saints. Missed a fine chance after Morgan Schneiderlin's effort hit the bar, heading wide with the goalkeeper down.","Tadic set up Nathaniel Clyne's equaliser at Anfield and looked lively .

In need of another striker following the exit of star man Luis Suarez, the Reds last week plumped for a shock move for the maverick Italian.

New boy: Steven Gerrard has backed Mario Balotelli (left) to shine at Liverpool . The 24-year-old was thrown straight in at the deep end by the Reds boss on Sunday, who started the striker from the outset at Tottenham six days after arriving from AC Milan.

'With all due respect to Manchester City and AC Milan, Mario is going to get a different kind of support here,' the Reds captain said.

All eyes were on him and I thought he was a terrific team player. 'He did a lot of ugly work for the team and showed some really good touches. You've got to remember that he's only had three lots of 45 minutes in pre-season, so with game time and getting used to the manager and players around him, he's going to be a terrific player for us.' Nice try: Balotelli first half strike was applauded by a laughing Brendan Rodgers (right) Balotelli was replaced just after the hour mark at White Hart Lane, by which point the three points were secure.

The Spanish striker passed a medical on Friday after the two clubs agreed a deal, which includes the option to buy permanently, earlier in the week and the paperwork has now been finalised. Aspas, 26, moved to Anfield from Celta Vigo last summer but had a disappointing season and made just 15 appearances, the majority as a substitute, and scored one goal.

"By . Neil Ashton for the Daily Mail . Roy Hodgson has admitted talking with Manchester United and England left back Luke Shaw at the World Cup amid increasing concerns about his fitness. Shaw, 19, the world’s costliest teenager when he left Southampton for Old Trafford in a £28million deal, was heavily criticised by United manager Louis van Gaal over his training regime. And Hodgson, who named Wayne Rooney as England’s new captain in his first squad since Brazil 2014, seems to have similar concerns. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis Van Gaal: US tour is possible cause of Luke Shaw injury . Injured: Luke Shaw was not named in Roy Hodgson's England squad as he recovers from injury . Fitness concerns: Hodgson admits he spoke to Shaw about his fitness during the World Cup . He said: ‘He might have had it mentioned to him a couple of times during the World Cup when we were together by people like myself and Gary Lewin (England’s head physio). ‘When Van Gaal talks to Mauricio Pochettino then Pochettino will say to him, “What you were saying to Luke Shaw is what I’ve been saying to him”. ‘I think a lot of Luke’s situation is purely down to the fact that he is still young, his body is changing but I think he’s aware that the work-rate which is required does mean he’s got to work very, very hard on that aspect of his game. ‘I must say, watching him play in the matches for Southampton — which caused me to select him — and watching him in the game against Costa Rica when he played, he didn’t seem to have too many problems coping with the physical side of the game. Having words: Louis van Gaal put Shaw on a special fitness regime during pre-season . ‘That doesn’t mean to say he can’t be fitter and if Louis thinks that he can get him fitter then I’m sure he will certainly have our approval. ‘Luke’s been aware of it and he will get fitter and stronger, not least of all because he’s still a very young man and his body has not yet reached its proper proportions for the level he wants to play at.’ Shaw is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury and has not been named in Hodgson’s England squad for Wednesday’s friendly with Norway at Wembley and the Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland five days later. The United left back, who turned 19 in July, is still living in a city-centre hotel in Manchester and is struggling to adapt to his new surroundings. Shaw is just one of several United players who have been on the end of Van Gaal’s volatile moods as he continues to search for his first competitive victory in charge. Making his point: Hodgson believes much of Shaw's issues are to do with the fact he is young . Yesterday, Hodgson began a new chapter with England after making some radical changes to the squad for the games against Norway and Switzerland. Arsenal defender Calum Chambers, Tottenham left back Danny Rose, Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback and Aston Villa’s Fabian Delph have been named in a new-look squad. Rooney, who has 95 caps for his country, was confirmed as England captain following Steven Gerrard’s retirement from international football.Hodgson’s decision to select Colback, who has made two appearances in the Barclays Premier League for his new club since his move from Sunderland, is eye-catching. Hodgson said: ‘Someone who knows him well up there called him “the ginger Pirlo” and it would be delightful if that epithet turns out to be the correct one. I think that would be a hard ask. New leader: Wayne Rooney was named the new England captain by Hodgson . VIDEO Wayne Rooney named England's captain . ‘We followed him in the opening games and I was at Aston Villa v Newcastle. At the moment, we have lost three central midfielders in Gerrard, Lampard (both retired) and Carrick (injured). ‘He plays in a position where vacancies can easily arise and we have to see how he gets on.’ Hodgson has a number of injuries to contend with. Shaw, Ross Barkley, Adam Lallana, Glen Johnson and Chris Smalling are absent from the squad. Colback, has already been nicknamed Jack Colbeckenbauer by fans in the North East and yesterday his club manager, Alan Pardew, likened him to England 1966 World Cup winner Alan Ball. Call-up: Jack Colback is one of the new additions to the England squad . ‘He’s a terrific player. The last time we won a World Cup we had a ginger in Alan Ball. Now we’ve got another one. It’s about time,’ said Pardew. After naming Rooney as captain England’s manager surprisingly admitted the player had ‘baggage’. He said: ‘It is wrong, I think, for me to look back too much into the past and any mis-demeanors the player may have had. ‘I’ve got to say in the two years he has been with me, I’ve had no reason at any time to question anything about his character, his desire to play for the country and the wholehearted, willingness to offer himself in any conceivable situation. ‘He has that baggage with him and he will have to accept that as a further part of the pressure along the way because, unfortunately, you can’t draw a line over the past.’ Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page.","England manager says he spoke to Luke Shaw about his fitness during the World Cup .

I’ve got to go there, express myself in training and hopefully be a part of the games. I want to show people what I am capable of and I know that once I’ve experienced it once, I will want to do it again. ‘I’ve just got to go there and do what I’ve been doing at club level, hopefully impress them and stay in the squad.’ Giving youth a chance: Hodgson has named a fairly inexperienced squad for the friendly with Norway and Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland . Highest praise: Roy Hodgson has labelled Jack Colback as the 'ginger Pirlo' after calling the Newcastle midfielder up to the England squad . Colback only learned of his call up on Thursday morning, as he explained: ‘I was in the gym when Tony (Toward, team administrator) came in and said he had received the paperwork saying I was involved. ‘If it had been anyone else I wouldn’t have believed it, but the manager had pulled me this morning to say that England had rang to check if I was fit, so therefore I may have a chance. When Tony confirmed it, I believed it. ‘To be honest, before today, when it comes to the time of the squad being announced, I’ve never really taken much notice or thought about it. ‘I’ve never been involved before, not even much as a young lad, and sometimes it can be difficult to get in there when you haven’t been around it before. ‘I just always wanted to concentrate on playing well for the team and doing well for the Club - not individual performances. ‘That’s why it has come as a surprise. It is a massive bonus in my career, a challenge I will relish and it will be a great experience.’","Jack Colback and Fabian Delph have been called up to the England squad .

Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has delivered the bad Budget news to the Government today that 'we are not going to have a co-payment of even one cent' Tony Abbott was still talking up a deal on the Medicare co-payment plan as late as this morning 'that is what we're working towards'. That was until Clive Palmer arrived to tell the Coalition that 'the co-payment is dead, we won't be supporting it' Mr Palmer continued, suggesting the co-payment had now been consigned to history. 'You can talk to all the analysts and crunch all the numbers you want but the fact of the matter is the Palmer United Senators will not be changing their position and the co-payment will not be getting through. 'We have been inundated with calls from real Australians and the message is very clear that they do not want it. 'It is another cost they simply can’t afford and the Palmer United Party cannot allow more pain to be inflicted on ordinary Australians who are already doing it tough under Tony Abbott. 'Low income earners, single parent families, pensioners, nursing home patients and those who are socially or financially disadvantaged will be hardest hit by a GP co-payment. 'It is a ruthless attack on Australians when savings can be made elsewhere in the budget. “There is zero chance of the Palmer United Party supporting it in the Senate,” Mr Palmer added. Mr Palmer has long lobbied for co-payment provisions to be altered, particularly for pensioners. Last week Mr Abbott repeated the Coalition's stance though. 'We don’t exempt pensioners from a PBS co-payment. Their co-payment is normally a little less than the co-payment that the public faces,' he said. 'I don't think it's unreasonable for a comparable amount to be paid for visits to the GP.' The proposal announced in the May Budget deemed that all patients would pay a $7 fee, but concession card holders and children would be bulk-billed after paying the fee 10 times in a year. Today, Mr Abbott remained confident the co-payment would get through. 'We certainly think it should, this is what we’re working towards,' he said. But without support from PUP, the Government will be hard pressed to breathe life back into the co-payment plan which was a major chunk of the $10.5 billion cut to health spending. The Medicare plan alone was forecast to save $3.5 billion over four years.","Clive Palmer says 'tell all Australians they don't need to worry any more, it's history'

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Treasurer Joe Hockey’s controversial remark that wealthy people spend more money on petrol seems to be the comment that just keeps on giving as social media erupts with mock suggestions on ‘what other things the poor don’t do’. Mr Hockey has come under an explosion of fire for his comments made on radio yesterday which has started the public expressing their outraged views with the hastag: #OtherThingsThePoorDontDo going off on Twitter.

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . An accountant has spent £25,000 on what she describes as her plastic surgery 'hobby' in a bid to get her dream body - all before her 25th birthday. Maddison Hawk, who had her ears pinned back at the age of six, claims the success of the surgery at that young age inspired her to give her entire body an overhaul. Soon after, she drew up a list of treatments and operations she wanted and, as soon as she turned 18, spent more than £2,000 on semi-permanent make up. Scroll down for video . Big spender: Maddison Hawk has spent £25,000 on what she describes as her plastic surgery 'hobby' in a bid to get her dream body - all before her 25th birthday . Makeover: Maddison Hawk has spent £23,000 on cosmetic surgery to look a million dollars, drawing up a list of treatments and operations she wanted and as soon as she turned 18, including chemical peels, countless lip fillers, regular teeth whitening and then eventually a £4,800 boob job boosting her from a 32C to a busty 32H . Next came a host of chemical peels, countless lip fillers, regular teeth whitening and then, at the age of 23, came a £4,800 breast enhancement, boosting her from a 32C to a 32H. Despite being a svelte size 12, Maddison booked in for liposuction on her tummy - and at the last minute decided to have the fat sucked from her whole body. Now a size eight, she insists her looks are worth every penny and has vowed to continue having surgery until she has the perfect body. Maddison, from Witney, Oxfordshire, said: 'After I had my ears done I got a taste for altering my body.

'I wanted to change the way I looked and started plotting - as soon as I was old enough, I was going to make some big changes. 'I don't believe that you have to accept the way you were born, I think it's fine to pay for changes to your body. 'And besides, what's the difference between wearing make up and having liposuction? It's all just tinkering!' Changing face: Maddison, pictured, left, now and, right, before all the treatments, had tattooed make-up on her eyes, eyebrows and lips costing £600 - plus £1,600 for top-ups a year later all from the age of 18 . Work in progress: Maddison, whose obsession started when she had her ears pinned back as a youngster, said she didn't see why you have to accept the way you were made when there's so many treatments and surgeries available to change the way you look . Maddison's obsession began when her mother Alison, 50, took her to have her ears pinned back because she was worried her daughter would be bullied at school. At 18, she had make-up tattooed on her eyes, eyebrows and lips costing £600 - plus £1,600 for top-ups a year later. Three years later she spent £750 on three chemical face peels and £3,500 on lip fillers over a year. Aged 23, she had her £4,800 breast enhancement, followed by £4,000 laser eye surgery, £1,100 teeth whitening, and laser hair removal on her legs and underarms for £600. Before and after: Maddison, pictured, left, before her surgeries and, right, after, insists that she doesn't regret any of her surgery, which she pays for from her wages as an accountant and hair extensions business . Cosmetic fan: Aged 23, she had her £4,800 boob job, followed by £4,000 laser eye surgery, £1,100 teeth whitening, and laser hair removal on her legs and underarms for £600 . But her biggest operation came in April last year when she had full body liposuction in April, costing £5,000. Petite Maddison said: 'I'd tried diet and exercise but nothing I did got rid of my pot belly. I decided lipo was the only answer. 'My surgeon agreed to lipo my tummy but said I didn't really need it on my arms or legs. 'But I said ""just go the whole hog"". While I was under anaesthetic, why not? I woke up in absolute agony. 'It was the most pain I've ever been in, but I recovered quickly and loved the results, going from a size 12 to a size eight. 'Of course it hurt - I'd had the fat sucked out of me - but no pain, no gain!' Under the knife: Maddison's biggest operation came in April last year when she had full body liposuction in April, costing £5,000 - every pound of which she says was worth it . Maddison, who has no debt, insists that she doesn't regret any of her surgery, which she pays for from her wages as an accountant and hair extensions business. She plans to have her boobs lifted, and more laser eye surgery, as well as Botox in the future. 'A nip here, a tuck there, I don't see what the big deal is,' she said.

"By . Reuters . and Ashley Collman for MailOnline . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday it flew an employee back to the United States from West Africa by chartered plane after the staff member came in contact with an international healthcare worker who later tested positive for Ebola. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the employee was 'feeling fine' and had been scheduled to return to the United States from West Africa anyway. The staffer's exposure was 'low-risk', the CDC said in a statement. According to the statement, the staff member worked in 'close proximity', which it defined as within three feet, and in the same room with the ill person for a prolonged period during the period that that individual had symptoms. Home: A CDC employee who came in contact with an Ebola patient, returned to the U.S. from West Africa on Wednesday. That employee has not displayed symptoms of the disease and is not believed to pose a risk to the public. Above, a photo showing the Ebola virus . The CDC transported the staff member via chartered plane because its regulations require that people who have contact with Ebola patients who travel long distances must travel by private means for 21 days after the last contact, the statement said. The provision is designed to protect other travelers in case the exposed person develops symptoms during the flight, it said. According to the World Health Organization, Ebola spreads through direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and through indirect contact with contaminated surfaces. According to the CDC statement, the staff person is not sick with Ebola, does not show symptoms of the disease and 'poses no Ebola-related risk to friends, family, co-workers or the public'. At least 1,427 people have died and 2,615 have been infected since Ebola was detected in Guinea in March. The outbreak has killed at least 120 healthcare workers. News of the CDC worker's return comes as the director of the health organization issued a statement, warning about the dangers of the fast-spreading disease. 'It's even worse than I'd feared' CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said on Wednesday. 'Every day this outbreak goes on, it increases the risk for another export to another country. 'The sooner the world comes together to help Liberia and West Africans, the safer we will all be.' Dr Frieden arrived in Liberia on Monday to asses the situation. Warning: News of the CDC worker's return came the same day that the health organization's director issued a statement, calling the Ebola crisis 'worse than I'd feared'.

"By . Infant Health Expert Dr Pamela Douglas . Dr Pamela Douglas busts the myths about what makes a contented newborn . The first four months of a baby’s life can be a testing time for parents and caregivers. The wide range of confusing, and sometimes conflicting advice available can create even more anxiety at an already stressful time. Brisbane GP and infant health expert Dr Pamela Douglas cuts through the confusion in her new book The Discontented Little Baby Book. The mother-of-two has busted the top six myths about caring for newborns. Myth 1. Babies need to be taught how to sleep . Babies don’t need to be taught how to sleep – sleep is a normal biological process, which can’t be forced. It is not under conscious control. Sleep is actually controlled by two biological sleep regulators and our job is to remove obstacles that are often put in the way of healthy sleep. Parents may be told that if they don’t teach their baby to sleep now, that child will become a poor sleeper later in childhood, with negative effects on learning and development. But this is simply not true, if you look at the latest evidence. Dr Douglas believes that babies don’t need to be taught how to sleep – sleep is a normal biological process which can’t be forced . Myth 2. Feed/play/sleep cycles are the best way to get your baby into a good sleep routine . Sleepiness at the end of a feed is caused by the hormones of satiety and relaxation, and is a sign that the normal biological sleep regulators are kicking in. Sleepiness at the end of feeds is a powerful biological cue; by deliberately ignoring this cue and not letting your baby fall asleep at the end of a feed, which is often what parents are told to do, we interfere with the healthy function of the sleep regulators. The sleep may not last for long but catnapping during the day is quite normal for babies. Dr Douglas (pictured with her baby) says sleepiness at the end of feeds is a powerful biological cue . Myth 3. Back-arching, breast refusal and vomiting are signs of gastro-oesphageal reflux disease (GORD) in this age group . Back-arching at the breast, pulling off of the breast or refusing to feed actually signal a feeding problem, one that can be helped by a health professional who is trained in clinical breastfeeding support. Vomiting (once medical conditions like pyloric stenosis have been ruled out) is normal and peaks at about four months. Dr Douglas says back-arching or pulling off of the breast, or refusing to feed, can actually signal a feeding problem . Myth 4. Burping helps settle babies . Burping is a practice that spread around the world with the British Empire, but is unnecessary. Babies relieve themselves of any wind naturally from any position, just like you and me. If it seems to be working for you, that’s fine – but if your baby is unsettled, I usually recommend not burping, because it disrupts that lovely sleepiness at the end of the feed which allows the baby’s biological sleep regulators to kick in. Dr Douglas doesn't recommend burping, because it disrupts the sleepiness at the end of the feed which allows the baby’s biological sleep regulators to kick in . Myth 5. Babies need a quiet, dark sleep environment free of stimulus . Many families are told that their baby is unsettled because of over-stimulation, but this is not true. This false belief can be traced back directly to the concern doctors felt at the beginning of the 20th century about the effects of electric lighting, motor transport and radio on children’s developing brains, and has persisted despite lack of evidence. In fact, all the new neuroscience research suggests that under-stimulation of the senses from long periods spent in quiet, dark rooms during the day represents the greater risk. Research suggests under-stimulation of the senses from long periods spent in quiet, dark rooms during the day represents the greater risk . Myth 6. Sleep breeds sleep . This adage is a misinterpretation of the fact that a baby who is relaxed and content falls asleep easily; that is, calm breeds calm. But sleep can’t be forced, and babies’ sleep needs are incredibly varied. Your baby might need half as much sleep as the baby next door in the same 24-hour period, and both babies are normal. Removing the obstacles to sleep – like long naps during the day in artificially dark and quiet rooms, or following a feed/play/sleep routine – will help your baby’s natural sleep regulators do their job. Doctor Pamela Douglas is a Brisbane based GP and infant health expert, and director of the Possums Clinic for Mothers and Babies. The Discontented Little Baby Book releases 1 September and price is $29.95. It’s available at University of Queensland Press .","Brisbane GP and infant health expert Dr Pamela Douglas busts top six newborn myths .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . A fan of Take That for more than 22 years, Mandy Emerson, 44, from Gateshead, couldn't believe her luck when she finally got the chance to meet Gary Barlow. But when she saw the photos of the moment, Ms Emerson, who, at just 5ft 1"", tipped the scales at 19st 10lbs, was left humiliated by the sight of her less than slender frame. Spurred on to lose weight by the picture, she now weighs 11st 10lbs and says she hopes to meet the singer again to show off her newly svelte figure. Embarrassing: Ms Emerson was left humiliated by her less than slender frame in this photo of her and the star . Looking good: Mandy Emerson has shed almost half her body weight following a meeting with Gary Barlow . 'I couldn't believe it when I was chosen to meet Gary,"" said Ms Emerson. 'As I stood up all I could think about was my dream was coming true - and I looked a complete mess and I was going to look horrific on the photograph. Barlow, who has also struggled with his weight over the years, was filming The X-Factor in Manchester when Ms Emerson was introduced. 'I have wanted to meet Gary for 22 years, so to get picked to finally meet him was amazing,' she adds. 'But when I looked back at the picture I was upset by the way that I looked and it shocked me.' Ms Emerson's problems began at the age of 21 following the birth of her son Lee, who is now 23, and were made worse after she had a hysterectomy aged 30. Indulging in a diet of burgers, fry-ups, chips and pies, she began to pile on the pounds and eventually developed asthma as a result. Big improvement: Ms Emerson, who is just 5ft 1"", weighed 19st 10lb at her heaviest but has since shed 8st . Compounding the problem were the steroids prescribed to treat an auto-immune condition and diabetes medicine given to her by her GP. Following the embarrassing moment with Barlow, which took place at a recording of The X Factor in Manchester, Ms Emerson was humiliated further when a medical consultant suggested that she have a gastric band fitted. 'You have to be grossly overweight for that, so I [thought that] I must be,' remembers Ms Emerson, who describes the moment as 'devastating'. Instead, she joined her local Slimming World group, the Birley Buffs, and after overhauling her diet and beginning a regular exercise regime, has managed to lose more than 8st. Once a size 28, she is now a slim size 14 and has overcome many of her medical ailments, including her diabetes and sky-high cholesterol levels. 'I never dreamt I could achieve so much and it's made such a huge difference - it's changed my life,' she adds. Shaping up: Barlow has struggled with his weight in the past (left) but has, like Ms Emerson, since shaped up . Overjoyed: A thrilled Ms Emerson would now like to meet Barlow for a second time - and get a better photo . 'I've got so much more energy and I can do things now that I couldn't before. My fitness has improved - I enjoy being active now rather than thinking of it as a chore. 'I know a lot of people like me worry about joining a slimming club because they don't know what to expect. 'But from the minute I walked into Slimming World, the support I've received from my consultant Nicola Young and the rest of the group has been brilliant. 'I couldn't have done it without them. It's like having lots of cheerleaders on your side, when you're doing well they spur you on further and when you're struggling they keep you going.' Although Ms Emerson was thrilled to be nominated for the Slimming World Woman of the Year competition by her friends, there is still one person she wants to show off her newly slender frame to - Gary Barlow. 'I would love to meet Gary again to get a picture taken with him now that I'm slimmer,' she beams. 'It would mark the significant change that I've made.'","Mandy Emerson, 44, from Gateshead, has shed half her body weight .

"By . Claire Coleman for the Daily Mail . Got a beauty problem? Try sticking a patch on it. Women are increasingly resorting to cloth, plaster and jelly ‘patches’ which, when stuck to the face, and sometimes left overnight, are said to treat everything from lip wrinkles to frown lines. But apart from giving your husband nightmares, do they work? Claire Coleman teamed up with skincare expert Jonquille Chantrey, who runs an aesthetic clinic in Cheshire, to test them. BUDGET EYEBAG BUSTER . Montagne Jeunesse Anti-Wrinkle Cool Eyes, £1.99 for two pairs, montagnejeunesse.com . The claim: These clever little eye patches help reduce fine lines, sagging skin and crow’s feet. Chill in the fridge before use. Claire says: They felt like blobs of jelly, or those ‘chicken fillets’ women use in their bras. Cooling and moisturising, so any lines due to dryness disappeared — but the effect wore off before the day was out. Expert view: Sagging skin and crow’s feet are caused by sun damage, fat loss and repeated muscle contraction. Any topical product will have to be able to deliver active ingredients through the skin barrier. But the cold mask helps to reduce swelling by temporarily shrinking the blood vessels under the eye. Verdict: Won’t get rid of all lines or bags, but will provide a temporary boost to eyes for an evening out. A total bargain. 3/5 . ESSENCE OF SNAIL . Skin Pep Hydro-Gel Decolletage, £14.99 for five, skinpep.com . The Claim: One application will dramatically hydrate, smooth, soften and boost skin elasticity. The mask contains five clinically tested peptides, botanical extracts, antioxidants . . . and concentrated snail secretion to rejuvenate fatigued looking skin. Claire says: Like all the other masks that trap moisture against the skin, this helped banish crepiness on the neck, although couldn’t smooth out deeper lines. Expert view: The neck is so often neglected. It needs special attention to prevent early signs of ageing, such as sagging and jowls. Snail secretion sounds like an odd ingredient, but there is some evidence that it contains a type of protein which may help with skin rejuvenation. Verdict: If your neck needs a bit of tender loving care, this mask will definitely give it a quick boost. 3/5 . FAREWELL TO FROWNS . Frownies Forehead & Between the Eyes, £18.95 for 144 patches, frownies.co.uk . They say: Frownies Facial Patches help change the shape of the muscle under the patch. By holding the muscle flat and relaxed while you sleep the body can reverse muscle memory, keeping you from frowning while you sleep. Claire says: These are like super-sticky stamps. You wet them, hold the skin taut, then stick them on. They sound basic but, after a couple of weeks, lines looked fainter. Expert view: Some studies have shown that you may frown 70-80 times in your sleep, which eventually contributes to permanent lines. If these patches stay in place, they may be of benefit. I like the concept! Verdict: Won’t get rid of wrinkles entirely as you’ll still frown during the day, but they’re inexpensive and quite effective. 5/5 . LUXURY EYE SMOOTHERS . Elemis Pro-Collagen Hydra-Gel Eye Masks, £46 for six pairs, timetospa.co.uk . The claim: Clinically proven to instantly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Claire says: Bigger than many cheaper ones, so worked on more of the face. Left on for 20 minutes, skin was smoother and tighter. Results seemed to last quite well. Expert view: Some interesting ingredients. The houttuynia cordata leaf is used in Chinese medicine as a detoxifying element, whereas the camellia sinensis leaf (found in green tea) has anti-inflammatory properties. Hyaluronic acid will smooth the dead outer layer of skin cells, making skin feel hydrated in the short term. Verdict: At this price, an occasional treat, but they did what they promised, hydrating, tightening and zinging up the eye area. 3/5 . GOLDEN LIPS . Jamela Luxurious Gold Crystal Collagen Lip Mask, £46.75 for 16, jamelaskincare.co.uk . The claim:The combination of gold and plant collagen helps to increase cellular metabolism. The rapid absorption of the nutrients also replenishes moisture leaving the lips smoother and healthier. Claire says: This makes you look quite strange, and only really stayed on when lying flat on your back, which was a bit annoying. Although lips were softer, they didn’t look plumper. Expert view: The skin on the lips is thinner than the rest of the face and therefore more prone to moisture loss. Also contains rose oil, recognised as an emollient to dry skin, and short-term benefits may be seen due to the application of hyaluronic acid on the skin surface. Verdict: This definitely softens lips, but the gold seems a bit of a gimmick. I don’t believe the mask will have an effect on the cellular metabolism, and at this price, you could buy a lot of hydrating, plumping lip balm. 1/5 . IRON OUT SMILE LINES . Skyn Iceland Hydro Cool Firming Face Gels, £30 for eight (four for forehead, four pairs for smile lines), marksandspencer.com . The Claim: Visibly smooth smile lines — in ten minutes flat — without a needle in sight. These peptide-packed transdermal patches plump deep creases around the mouth. Claire says: Although they definitely helped improve the surface of the skin, the deeper lines did not disappear in ten minutes. Expert view: Hydrating oils can instantly smooth skin by softening the layer of dead cells on its surface, however long-term hydration usually needs specifically formulated hyaluronic acids to penetrate deeply. The gels contain Arctic cloudberry, which has high levels of vitamins A, C, E and B, important for healthy skin. Verdict: Naso-labial folds — or marionette lines — are hard to treat without filler. These patches improve the appearance of the skin, but to see serious results you would need to apply ingredients such as these daily. 2/5 . WIPE AWAY THE YEARS . Line Smoothing Complex High Potency Treatment Mask, £46 for six, drlewinns.co.uk . The claim: A powerful anti-ageing booster to target the early signs of ageing and tired, lack-lustre complexions. Packed with natural extracts and advanced skin-smoothing and line-erasing technology to hydrate, plump and soothe skin. Claire says: Being in two pieces makes this mask easy to use with no mess. Results were good: skin felt hydrated and looked glowing. Expert view: Repeated facial expressions eventually cause permanent wrinkles. The key ingredient appears to be acetyl hexapeptide-8, which claims to soften some expression lines. An alternative to Botox? Not quite yet. Verdict: This will get rid of fine lines, and as it’s soothing and fuss-free would be ideal for rejuvenating skin the morning after a party. About the same price as many luxury face masks, without the mess. 4/5 .","Range of plasters on market, which claim to beat wrinkles .

In an article for The Atlantic, the inventor and director of the Centre for Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) says that the advert-reliant internet is the result of good intentions gone awry. But it was not his intention to annoy the world when he came up with the idea at web hosting service Tripod.com in the mid-1990s. Pop-up adverts annoy users so much because they obstruct the view of a page that they are viewing and have to be closed down with the click of a mouse. Mr Zuckerman describes them as a barrier to overcome. Mr Zuckerman (pictured) thinks that if the internet is reliant on advertising, people's privacy will be invaded. He says: '20 years into the ad-supported web, we can see that our current model is bad, broken, and corrosive' Most . internet users are find pop-up adverts that disrupt their browsing down . right annoying (illustrated). Ethan Zuckerman - the man who invented them - now  believes that advertising is the ‘original sin of the web’. He explains that a large car company loved the idea of pop-up advertising and he found himself coding an advertising window that popped up on an unsavoury website. He is now sorry for coding it, but says that his intentions at the time were good. Ethan Zuckerman says that as long as the internet is reliant on advertising, people’s privacy will be invaded. ‘Free’ services are currently selling their users and their attention as the product, he says. The computer scientist believes that if people want to make sure companies and organisations can no longer see the sites they are visiting, they will have to pay for future services. Mr Zuckerman thinks that if this happens, many users would abandon services that they deem not worth paying for, so some websites would shrink, while others would grow quickly. He thinks this move might increase competition and lead to more innovative websites and services. The computer scientist also helped to develop software that allows advertisers to see what users click on, which lets them to target consumers in a more personal way. Mr Zuckerman believes that as long as the internet is reliant on advertising, people’s privacy will be invaded. He says: ‘20 years into the ad-supported web, we can see that our current model is bad, broken, and corrosive.’ He thinks that over the years, users have been trained to expect this and accept that it is part of them using certain websites. ‘I have come to believe that advertising is the original sin of the web,’ he writes. ‘The fallen state of our Internet is a direct, if unintentional, consequence of choosing advertising as the default model to support online content and services.’ Mr Zuckerman says that an internet that is not built upon advertising could be achieved if users start to pay for services that they love. The move would see website numbers change considerably and could lead to more innovative products. He believes that ‘free’ services are selling their users and their attention as the product at the moment.","Ethan Zuckerman invented pop-up adverts in the mid-1990s .

"By . Mark Prigg . It may not net him quite as much cash as a Hollywood blockbuster, or have quite the same budget - but Tom Hanks hopes his latest project will help people write. The Hanx Writer app recreates three classic typewriters on screen - allowing people to hear and see them. Developers worked with the actor, who has previously spoken of his love for vintage typewriters. Scroll down for video . Thwe Hanx Writer app has three vintage typewriters - and sound and looks exactly like them. Users can email or print their work to retain its look. The app has three typewriters to choose from, and each recreates the sound and fonts of the original machine. 'The Hanx Prime Select is the writer’s best friend and is free; the Hanx 707 is bold enough for any journey; and the Hanx Golden Touch is sleek and elegant.' Hanx Writer recreates the experience of a manual typewriter, but with the ease and speed of an iPad, the developers said. 'With Hanx Writer, you’ll hear the rhythm of your work with SHOOK SHOOK or FITT-FITT.” – Tom Hanks said. 'No longer must you surrender modern luxuries, like the DELETE key, to enjoy the look, feel, and sound of good, old-fashioned word-processing.' Each document written in Hanx Writer can be emailed, printed, and shared and has its own unique statement-making personality. 'I wanted to have the sensation of an old manual typewriter – I wanted the sound of typing if nothing else,' Hanks said. Hanks tweeted this picture of himself to show he also uses more traditional keyboards. 'Because I find it’s like music that spurs along the creative urge. Bang bang clack-clack-clack puckapuckapuckapucka… I wanted the ‘report’ of each letter, each line.' He says the app is a 'tool, not a toy', and has been collecting typewriters since the 1970s. 'I use a manual typewriter — and the United States Postal Service — almost every day,' he recently wrote in the New York Times. 'My snail-mail letters and thank-you notes, office memos and to-do lists, and rough — and I mean very rough — drafts of story pages are messy things, but the creating of them satisfies me like few other daily tasks.' 'Tom sent us three vintage typewriters from his personal collection for us to enjoy during this project,' the developers said. Users can choose between three specially created vintage typewriters. 'We took full advantage of this and typed a few pages on each one. 'We had a little fun with them as well! On a new employee’s first day, he was welcomed to Hitcents with a desk 'fully stocked' with one of Tom’s typewriters, a sheet of paper, and a pencil.' He also explained the differences between the three typewriters in the app, adding that the Prime Select would let you 'bang away', while the 707 is smaller and quieter, and the Golden Touch is the luxury model.","Actor has collected typewriters since the 1970s and has huge collection .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . With his pricked up ears and large 'puppy dog' eyes, two-year-old German Shepherd Harry looks the picture of innocence. But behind that friendly lolling tongue lurks something of a destructive streak, with the pet causing £5,000-worth of damage since his owners took him home as a 12-week-old puppy. Despite hardly ever being left alone by owners Kay and Kyle Gregory at their home in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, Harry turns 'destroyer' whenever he is left 'for an hour or two' - or even when the family are asleep. Scene of the crime: Harry the German Shepherd has caused £5,000 worth of damage to a couple's home in two years since they got him as a puppy, and often gets to the morning post and magazines before his owners . In the past two years, Harry has managed to ruin 15 pairs of shoes, five handbags, four purses, several baseball caps and hats, eight dog beds, bras, coats and countless books. The pet has also taken chunks out of numerous rugs and carpets, chewed on sofas, door frames, tables, and bannisters - as well as eating several dog leads. The long list, revealed by Mr and Mrs Gregory - who both work for holiday firms - also includes a George Foreman grill, a Black & Decker garden strimmer and a Dyson vacuum cleaner. Campaign of destruction: Despite hardly ever being left alone by owners Kay and Kyle Gregory at their home in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, Harry turns 'destroyer' whenever he is left 'for an hour or two' Picture of innocence: Harry, who has pricked up ears and large 'puppy dog' eye, is pictured with the family cat . All three electrical items were 'bitten to pieces' by Harry, who left them broken on the floor when he had finished with them. The list goes on to include two pairs of Mr Gregory's spectacles, ripping up lino floors and chomping on the floor covering - and also biting through and wrecking several wedding presents from when the couple got married on June 2 last year. Mrs Gregory, 38, said she and her 31-year-old husband 'dare not think' about how much Harry's antics have cost the family, but estimates it to be around £5,000. Putting his foot in it: In the past two years Harry has destroyed 15 pairs of shoes, including these boots, which had belonged to Mrs Gregory . Pulled apart: Harry has even pulled apart eight dog beds, which his owners then have to replace . 'We got him at 12 weeks old and babied him far too much,' she said. 'We took him to puppy school for three months but he didn't get anything out of it and he started destroying the house one day when he was left on his own while we were at work. 'Luckily, because of our shifts he's only ever left for a couple of hours at a time, but he's destroyed 15 pairs of shoes in his two years living here. 'He used to be able to unlock the shoe cupboard but my husband has moved the lock higher up so he can no longer reach it."" Efforts: Mrs Gregory says she had tried 'almost everything' to stop Harry's destructive streak, taking him to dog trainer for three months, getting a dog behaviour expert in and leaving him with chewy dog toys and treats . She added: ""The most shocking thing he ever ate was our George Forman grill. 'We used it in the morning and left it out planning on cleaning up when we got home.. but when we got back it was in pieces - Harry's teeth can cut through metal! 'He has eaten handbags, purses, had a good chew on my coffee table, eaten half the rug and we've just had to pay for the settees to be re-upholsted as he ate them. 'He ate the lino floor and this is our fourth stair carpet so far. 'In fact, last time he ate the stair carpet it had been down less than a week and we couldn't afford to replace it all so we just got the guy to come round and replace the first few steps, which he ate last week. 'He has eaten a lot of the bannister on the stairs and the door frame in one of the rooms. To tell the tooth: Harry has also taken chunks out of numerous rugs and carpets, chewed on sofas, door frames, tables, and bannister - as well as eating several dog leads . Owner and pet: Mr Gregory is pictured with Harry shortly after the couple took him home at 12 weeks old . 'A few days after our wedding we arrived home to find he had destroyed some of our presents - we don't know what they were as we hadn't opened them - I cried for hours over that."" 'He's eaten two pairs of my husband's glasses and my son Michael's favourite baseball cap....I could honestly go on for a long time.' Mrs Gregory says she had tried 'almost everything' to stop Harry's destructive streak, taking him to dog trainer for three months, getting a dog behaviour expert in and leaving him with loads of chewy dog toys and treats. Remorse? Mrs Gregory says Harry enjoys destroying things too much to think ahead . No matter what, however, Harry snubs any attempt to change his 'wayward behaviour'. 'Sometimes the damage he does is actually when we are in the house, just last week he crept into our bedroom at night, stole a teddy bear from a shelf and crept downstairs with it,' said Mrs Gregory. 'In the morning the bear had one eye and was looking worse for wear. 'We always know when he's done something wrong as he looks very guilty and looks away and tries to hide. 'He does seem to have some remorse but enjoys destroying things too much to think ahead."" She added: 'When he was a pup we took him to dog classes, to try and train him to be obedient.. it did nothing for him. 'We once had a dog expert come to the house for a couple of hours to see if she could ""fix"" Harry. 'She was a believer in the primal way of training a dog, the Alpha theory - she certainly knew her stuff but we didn't feel it was the right thing for Harry. 'We had already very much made him our baby so weren't prepared to start growling at him."" 'We also set up cameras around the house to see if we could see what was triggering off his destroying. 'We didn't really get anything from it but did see that he was ignoring his toys, bones and chews, instead preferring to munch on furnishings and personal belongings. 'He has many interactive toys and we swap them around so he doesn't get bored of them. Best pals: Mr and Mrs Gregory say that regardless of everything Harry has destroyed their pet is 'so, so loved' True love: Harry is also obsessed with cats and is 'best friends' with the Gregory family cat Jess - snuggling up to her and grooming her . 'Regardless of everything he has destroyed, he really is the centre of our world. He is so, so loved.' Harry is also obsessed with cats and is 'best friends' with the Gregory family cat Jess - snuggling up to her and grooming her. Mrs Gregory said: 'Harry loves cats. He is obsessed with our female cat and is often found trying to snuggle up to her and she spends half of her life with a wet head as he is always licking and grooming her.' Insurance companies almost never cover 'pet damage' - limiting polices to cover 'vermin' like damage caused by rats and insects, not household pets.

Currently codenamed Threshold, it is expected to include a 'mini' Smart Menu and separate Windows for its controversial Metro-style 'tile' applications. Earlier this year Microsoft was forced to bring back its Start menu after users complained they were confused by its Windows 8 'tile' interface. Scroll down for video . Windows 8's controversial start menu - which is set to be abandoned in Windows 9 . Windows 9 is expected to feature  a new 'mini' Smart Menu . It will have separate windows for Metro-style 'tile' applications running on the desktop . Microsoft is also planning to remove its charms, an overlay used to access search, share, the Start Screen, devices, and settings. It will also include Cortnana, a new virtual assistant similar to Apple's Siri. The new software will be shown off at the end of next month, according to The Verge. The date is currently 'tentative,' according to the report. 'The Threshold version of Windows is currently in development and Microsoft plans to release a preview version of what will likely be named Windows 9 to developers on September 30th or shortly afterwards,' the site claims. Last week, ZDNet reported that Microsoft is planning to launch a 'technology preview' of Threshold at the end of September or early October. Users will be able to try out the operating system, but would need to have software updates automatically downloaded to the platform each month. The firm is hoping it can undo some of the damage done by windows 8, which was poorly recieved among consumers. 'Threshold is expected to include a number of new features that are aimed at continuing to improve Windows' usability on non-touch devices and by those using mice and keyboards alongside touch,' according to ZDNet .

However, many users were confused, and Microsoft recently reinstated the classic start menu on its desktop. The new software will also include a Siri-like personal assistant. Microsoft formally announced earlier this year it has developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called Cortana, a direct rival to Apple's Siri. The feature has been rumored for some months and a test version was demonstrated at the event by Joe Belfiore, a Windows Phone executive. The Cortana service, which can take verbal instructions to search the Web, set alarms, make calls and a host of other actions, is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard feature on Windows phones and desktops.","New version expected to include new mini smart menu .

Strays dogs are a huge problem in Chile, where the Google Street view images were taken. An estimated 2.5 million dogs live in the streets of Chile. According to a study conducted by the Veterinary Medicine Faculty of The University of Chile, in 2002 in Santiago alone there were over 1,100,000 dogs. Most of them (52%) were street dogs with owner, which means that this animals are allowed to roam public places and return home at will. Google's Street View mapping cars were recording Meza Bell 2815-2861 in the Quinta Normal, Región Metropolitana area of Chile. As the car approaches the dog, it seems oblivious, continuing to carry on standing in the road. Google told MailOnline it was currently investigated the images.

Even Wiseman seemed lost for words, simply tweeting 'unbelievable' with the image . an aurora from space, with the 'arms' of the space station visible. Astronaut Reid Wiseman seemed lost for words, simply tweeting 'unbelievable' with the image . In an interview last year with MailOnline, former Commander of the ISS, Chris Hadfield said that lightning shows were one of the best parts watching Earth from the ISS. ‘Imagine you’re lying in bed, with your eyes closed, and there is this tremendous light show coming through your eyes that keeps exploding,’ he said, describing an immense storm over Indonesia. ‘It looked as if someone with a fat paint brush was swiping it over the Earth for about 500 miles, this great bright light, and it was continuous, back and forth…If there had been gravity, my jaw would have dropped.’ 'Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine this,' he later said, tweeting a second image. The images are just the latest in a series of stunning images and videos from the space station, a tradition started by commander Chris Hadfield when he was aboard. Earlier this month, Wiseman tweeted hypnotic flashes over Italy are unlike any lightning storm you’ve ever seen before. The stunning Vine was captured by astronaut Reid Wiseman as he looked down on Earth from his 150 mile (250km) vantage point on the ISS. It shows the awesome power of the storm lighting up the country and, according to the post yesterday, left Wiseman ‘speechless.’ Vine is a mobile service that creates short looping videos which are six seconds or less. A second image shows the stunning Aurora against part of the space station . In June, the 38-year-old made history by becoming the first ISS crew member to send a Vine from space. The short timelapse condensed a 92-minute orbit into the span of around six seconds showing the space station hurtling around the planet at 17,500 mph (27,600 km/h). The sun never sets in the Vine because the space station's orbit comes into alignment with something known as the day and night ‘terminator’ line.

"By . Ben Spencer . If you yawn and the person next to you follows suit, don’t worry – you are not boring them. Rather, it is a good sign, for it means they really like you. A scientific study suggests ‘contagious’ yawns are a sign of deep empathy. They are caused by an irrepressible need to share and understand the emotions and feelings of others. Scroll down for video . If you yawn and the person next to you follows suit, they might like you, according to new research.

"By . Andy Whelan . Suspected war criminal: Modeste Hakizimana last week . A suspected war criminal accused of playing a role in the slaughter of nearly a million Rwandans is working as a taxi driver in Britain and cannot be deported because of human rights laws. Modeste Kennedy Hakizimana, 41, is alleged by the UK Border Agency's War Crimes Unit to have helped Hutu soldiers kill members of the Tutsi ethnic group during the genocide in 1994. As a prominent member of the ruling party which is accused of planning the genocide in the central African country, he is also alleged to have made speeches in favour of the massacre. But for the past 13 years Hakizimana has been living in Britain and now works as a mini-cab driver in Redbridge, East London. Hakizimana arrived in Britain in 1999 after Rwanda was taken over by a Tutsi-dominated party. He sought asylum, but his application was turned down. An immigration tribunal has since ruled he does not qualify for refugee or humanitarian protection in Britain because he is suspected of crimes against humanity in Rwanda. But he has been allowed to remain because of a precedent set in the High Court which let four suspected Rwandan war criminals stay in Britain on the basis that they would not get a fair trial in their home country, breaching their human rights. When The Mail on Sunday approached Hakizimana last week in the car park of a hotel in Redbridge to ask him about the allegations, he denied any involvement in the genocide and flew into a rage. He refused to answer further questions and then called police and falsely accused the reporter of racially assaulting him and spitting on him. Officers questioned him and the reporter – then issued Hakizimana with an £80 spot fine for wasting police time. The genocide in Rwanda began after a plane carrying the Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana, leader of the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party, was shot down in April 1994. The MRND government blamed Tutsi rebels from the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and this sparked the massacre of almost a million Tutsis. Hakizimana is a Hutu from the village of Rambura in north Rwanda, the same village as Mr Habyarimana. Hakizimana's brother Major Thaddee Bagaragaza was chief of the Presidential Guard to Mr Habyarimana and also died when their plane was shot down. The immigration tribunal heard that while studying biology and chemistry at the National University of Rwanda from 1992-94, Hakizimana was leader of the Butare campus MRND party. In 1999 Hakizimana fled Rwanda – leaving behind his wife and child – and came to Britain. The tribunal was told that since arriving, Hakizimana had fathered a boy to a Kenyan nurse but they broke up because she claimed he was aggressive. It is understood he lived in a council house near Romford, Essex, but has now moved. Hakizimana had his first asylum application refused by the Home Office in 1999 but in 2002 he was granted exceptional leave to remain. When it was due to expire at the end of 2005, he claimed indefinite leave to remain but the Home Office rejected this in April 2009 because it believes he is a war criminal. Genocide: A young boy stands beside a pile of slaughtered Tutsi's in Kigali during the Rwandan Civil War . This decision was based on a report by the UK Border Agency's War Crimes Unit which said 'there are serious reasons for considering the subject committed, aided, abetted or otherwise assisted in the commission of crimes against humanity and/or genocide'. In August 2009, following the High Court ruling that year on the four suspected Rwandan war criminals, the Home Office granted Hakizimana discretionary leave to remain. But he appealed against the Home Office's decision not to grant him indefinite leave to remain and the case was heard at the immigration tribunal in July 2010, where a judge dismissed his asylum claim but granted him humanitarian protection. The Home Office challenged this ruling and a hearing at the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber found in its favour. The tribunal heard that in the first week of May 1994 – during the genocide – Hakizimana travelled from his home in Rambura to the Butare campus. He claims it was to collect his books and studying material, but the Home Office alleges he returned to help identify Tutsis to the soldiers. The remains of victims laid to rest at the Murambi Genocide Memorial, Rwanda on the anniversary of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide . The Home Office claimed that as the leader of the student MRND party he had admitted possessing a list of Hutu students which could have been used to identify Tutsi students for killing. The Home Office believed it was 'neither plausible nor credible' that he had returned to collect his books and 'was much more likely that [he] had returned to participate in the genocide and had done so'. In ruling that he did not qualify for humanitarian protection, the immigration judges said: 'The claimant may not have killed anyone himself, but his hands are not clean .  .  . he did know both what was planned, what was happening, and was complicit in it.' Last night Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, who has tabled a Bill to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights, said: 'It's extraordinary that someone suspected of genocide should be driving a taxi. They should be before a court facing charges. 'Anyone suspected of serious crimes like genocide should face justice and the Human Rights Act should not obstruct the proper course of justice.' Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of the Migrationwatch UK think-tank, said: 'For reasons that will baffle most British people we cannot send him back to Rwanda. This cannot be right.' The UK Border Agency said: 'Anyone accused of war crimes should be put on trial in their home country and even when the courts rule against us, we keep these cases under constant review. Meanwhile we impose stringent reporting and employment restrictions. We will not allow the UK to become a refuge for war criminals.' After speaking to our reporter, Hakizimana emailed The Mail on Sunday and again complained he was racially abused and spat on, and claimed publication of the story would breach his human rights. He wrote: 'I entirely refute any allegation that I was involved in the commission of genocide in Rwanda and indeed any such related allegation.' The Mail on Sunday left a message with Hakizimana's immigration solicitors but they failed to respond. What happened when an MoS reporter approached Mr Hakizimana. Andy Whelan: Are you Modeste Kennedy Hakizimana? Modeste Hakizimana: Yes. AW: Are you  from Rwanda? MH: Yes. AW: I'm a newspaper reporter from The Mail on Sunday. We are looking at an immigration tribunal case. We understand that you moved here in 1999.  Is that correct? MH: Yes, that is correct. AW: And you were a student leader at the MRND party at university? MH: What is this? [He walks away and gets inside his taxi.] . AW: We understand that the Home Office believes you took part in acts of genocide? We are running a story, would you like to make a comment? MH: I don't know you, man [starts engine]. This is assault. AW: It's not assault. I'm just asking if it's true what the Home Office say. MH: I don't know what you are talking about. I have nothing to answer with you, I have nothing to answer. AW: Did you take part in genocide? MH: What do you mean did you take part in genocide? That is a false allegation. You are assaulting me. AW: Is it a false allegation? [Hakizimana gets out of car.] . MH: Boss... I think that you are talking to the wrong person. AW: Am I? MH: Definitely yes ...  So what I will do now, I am calling the police because definitely you are assaulting  me. [Shouting.] You are an animal... You think because you are a white man you can just abuse me? AW: No I'm not, I'm asking you a question. MH: I don't know you, I don't know you, sir. I'm calling  the police. Hakizimana then called the police on his mobile phone. He told them: . 'Police police police please... Someone is assaulting me. My name is Modeste and I'm being assaulted by someone. I'm just by Premier Inn hotel. Just by Redbridge Railway station... Because he's making false allegations... I'm just doing my job working, I'm a taxi driver, and someone came up and started abusing me... He's a white man... I need the police to come out. I need the police around here please.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . Discount supermarket Aldi has banned sweets and chocolates from its checkout displays after complaints from parents about the 'pester power' of their children. The UK's fastest growing supermarket said racks of sweets will be replaced with dried and fresh fruit, nuts and juices, following a trial of these healthier options at checkouts earlier this year. From January 2015, all confectionery, chocolate and sweets will be removed from Aldi's checkouts and replaced with healthier options in a victory for health campaigners. From January 2015, all sugary treats will be removed from Aldi's checkouts and replaced with healthier options . The decision follows a 16 week trial of healthier tills in a select number of Aldi stores from February to June. Giles Hurley, Joint Managing Director of Corporate Buying at Aldi, said: 'The healthier tills trial enabled us to determine what our customers want at the checkout. 'It quickly showed that healthier foods prove more popular with our shoppers than the traditional checkout offer of confectionery and sweets. 'Aldi takes a customer-focused approach, which involves helping our shoppers to lead healthier lifestyles. We are now pleased to be able to roll-out healthier tills as part of this.' Kawther Hashem, Nutritionist for Action on Sugar, told MailOnline: 'We are glad to hear this announcement from Aldi, finally more and more retailers are ditching the horrifically unhealthy products from their checkouts, which only encourage ""pester power"" and makes the whole shopping experience more difficult for busy parents. 'As a nation we should be reducing unnecessary sugar and calories from our diet and one of the ways to help us do this is to stop impulse buys. 'An even better way is to make all the products healthier in the first place. We hope Aldi are looking at making all of their products better for everyone.' The move by Aldi follows a recent study by the University of Sheffield which found nine in ten items at the checkouts of supermarket convenience stores would be considered ‘very unhealthy’, according to Food Standards Agency guidelines. The vast majority of these were chocolate treats and stacked on shelves at one metre and below, which is directly in the eye-line of children aged three to five. The Prime Minister has previously lambasted stores for using this tactic, famously attacking WHSmith for putting boxes of chocolate oranges at checkouts. As far back as 2006, the then Opposition complained in a speech about ‘irresponsible’ marketing techniques by shops. Marks and Spencer is one of the few remaining grocers still selling the snacks at checkouts . Similar moves were made by Tesco in May this year at all its Express and Metro stores after bosses found the most annoying part for parents was the 'pester' factor at the checkout when small children wanted sugary treats. Aldi's biggest rival Lidl has also banned sweets from the so-called 'guilt aisles' at at all 600 of its UK stores. Sainsbury's had scrapped sweets from its biggest store checkouts but has been criticised for continuing to sell confectionery at its convenience store checkouts, with a new shop opening almost every week. Marks and Spencer is one of the few remaining grocers still selling the snacks at checkouts - although campaigners are pushing the Government to pass a law making the practice illegal.","Aldi has banned sweets and chocolates from its checkout displays .

A spectator at a motorbike race got a bit too close for comfort when he bagged a spot by the track - and nearly got flattened by a rider who had been thrown from his bike. Ian Robinson was watching the Ulster Grand Prix at Deer's Leap, in Northern Ireland, when a rider called Bruce Anstey fell from his bike and rolled across the opposite side of the road. His bike however continued to slide down the road, taking out rider Michael Sweeney who was flung through the air right where Mr Robinson was stood filming the dramatic action. The spectator dropped the camera in surprise as he leapt to get out of the way leaving the lens pointing at a crowd of spectators who had chosen to view the race from a safer distance. The accident meant that the race was halted in the first lap but fortunately there were no serious injuries.

Fire call: What an iPhone looks like after it catches fire, as happened when a blazing smartphone (not the one pictured) forced the evacuation of a Prague-bound flight from Tel Aviv aiport . The father of the phone's owner, Yarden Leviovej, told Nova TV (as translated by iClarified): 'My daughter opened her purse, from which we saw the flames and the heat radiating from it.' After the source of the flames and smoke was established, and the cabin cleared, the flight was reboarded. However Yarden, who was travelling with her family, had to leave without her burned out smartphone. In July, the Civil Aviation Authority made a series of videos about the dangers of and risks associated with the transportation of lithium batteries, the power source of most personal electronic devices that would be used by travellers. The videos, in conjunction with the US's Federal Aviation Administration, are aimed at airline and airport staff, cargo handlers, check-in staff and cabin crew, and explain the increased fire risk that comes with lithium batteries on passenger and cargo planes. The CAA explains that 'although lithium batteries are very safe, their high energy levels mean they can pose a fire risk if damaged.' 'As a result they must be treated with care and stowed appropriately during flight.' In-flight entertainment: An iPhone similar to the one which caught alight, likely due to a faulty battery . The use of items such as smartphones and tablets is only set to increase as airlines increasingly begin to offer on-board WiFi as part of their on-board entertainment. It is the International Civil Aviation Organisation which sets the worldwide guidelines for dangerous goods, with lithium batteries a common cause for concern in their publicly available literature. Current rules allow passengers to carry mobile phones, laptops, tablets, cameras and equipment in their carry on and hold luggage, but new security restrictions demand they be charged and able to be powered up on request.

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . An animal rights group has released harrowing footage of a circus elephant going on the rampage and being gunned down on the street 20 years after the incident to draw attention to the cruelty it says they suffering being trained to entertain. The People For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals organisation (Peta), posted footage on social media of Tyke the elephant running amok at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1994. Just before a performance she went berserk, killing one of her trainers and then charging out into the street, sending passers-by running for their lives. Scroll down for video. WARNING: Graphic content . Shocking: Tyke the elephant ran amok just before a performance at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center in Honolulu in Hawaii in 1994 . Out of control: The terrified animal left one dead and 13 injured . Police quickly arrived on the scene and shot the elephant dead. It took almost 100 rounds to bring her down and she eventually collapsed dead against the side of a car. Along with the death of the trainer, the rampage left 13 people injured. Peta is using the footage to persuade circuses to abandon their use of animals, claiming that the training they endure ‘drives them to the brink’. ‘It’s no surprise that these animals lash out,’ it said. ‘Circuses use violence, intimidation, and extreme confinement to force elephants to perform inane tricks. These cruel training techniques are used to break elephants' spirits when they're only babies, and they mark the beginning of a life in which everything that is natural and important to these sensitive, intelligent animals is taken away from them.’ Stopped in her tracks: Tyke cannot carry on after facing a hail of bullets . Gunned down: Tyke was shot almost 100 times after running out into the street . Taking aim: A man fires his rifle at Tyke . Tragedy: Peta claims that training animals to perform is cruel - and can have dangerous consequences for humans . Peta has already scored one victory, with the Moscow International Circus confirming this week that it will use only willing human performers and no animals in its upcoming shows at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center. Peta Foundation Deputy General Counsel Delcianna Winders added: ‘As the world saw 20 years ago when Tyke lashed out and died bellowing on the street, forcing frustrated animals to perform in circuses can have deadly consequences. Peta supporters and kind people around the world will be relieved to hear that the Moscow International Circus is putting safety and kindness first and going animal-free in Hawaii.’ Acts that use big cats - as the Moscow International Circus had reportedly planned to do - also pose a risk to the public, Peta points out, as on average, captive big cats in the U.S. kill one person every year and injure 10 more.","Elephant Tyke ran amok in Hawaii in 1994, killing her trainer and injuring 13 .

"By . Carol Driver for MailOnline . A teenager had to be rescued after a surging riptide dragged her out to sea at a popular tourist beach off the Cornish coast. Nicole Lonsdale, of Uxbridge, London, was on a summer break with her family in Cornwall when she was dragged towards rocks by a strong underwater current at Porth Beach, near Newquay. Her family watched in horror as Nicole, 15, was dragged, screaming for help, towards rocks by the treacherous riptide as she swam yards from the beach. Warning: Holidaymakers have been told to observe red flags at Porth Beach near Newquay, Cornwall . Her father Paul, 44, swam out in an attempt to rescue her but was not able to hold on to her and she was swept across the mouth of Porth Bay. The teenager finally managed to clamber on to a rock ledge, while Paul was stranded on rocks 200 yards away on the opposite side of the bay. Holidaymakers who saw the unfolding drama from the beach alerted the coastguard, who launched Newquay's inshore lifeboats and scrambled the air-sea rescue helicopter. One of the lifeboats inched close to the rocks and lifted Paul to safety, but the waves and riptide were so strong that it couldn't reach his daughter clinging to the rocks the other side of the bay. The rescuers yelled to her to hang on and after a few minutes she was airlifted to safety in a harness lowered by the helicopter. Popular: The family was enjoying a day at the beach while on holiday in Cornwall when the incident happened . The watching crowds on the beach clapped and cheered as she was placed in the helicopter's survivor bay and flown to hospital. Suffering from the cold and exhausted by her ordeal, and sporting a few cuts and bruises where she'd scrambled on to the jagged rocks, she was otherwise unhurt. Paul said: ‘I swam out and tried to grab hold of her but I just couldn't manage it. ‘When she was swept back out to sea I thought ""this is it, this is the end"". ‘I shouted for help - I just didn't know what to do. It's a miracle she managed to get on to the rocks. ‘The lifeboat and the helicopter were just amazing. It's really strange because our family are RNLI fund-raisers.’ The rescue happened at 6.30pm on Monday, just minutes after the beach lifeguards had packed up for the day. A coastguard spokesman said: ‘Thankfully this ended happily - it could have turned out tragically. ‘The riptides can be treacherous so holidaymakers should take great care and observe the red flag warning areas at all times.’","Nicole Lonsdale, 15, was swept out to sea while on holiday near Newquay .

"By . Laura Silver for MailOnline . It won't just be children and teachers who'll be upset if the government slashes school holidays from six weeks to four. Theme parks and other tourist attractions could be forced to sack staff or even close if the traditional summer break is cut short. The Deregulation Bill, which is in its final stages in the House of Lords, would allow schools to reduce the summer holidays, but lengthen other holidays at Christmas and Easter instead. Rollercoaster: After surviving the recession the leisure industry is being threatened by The Deregulation Bill . Concerned about how the new holidays would impact on numbers to tourist attractions in the summer, Julie Dalton, managing director of Gulliver's Land, World and Kingdom theme parks said: 'We are hoping the bill won't be passed. 'Our biggest weeks are in the summer holidays. Around one third of our business comes then because that is when it is nice weather and you can get out and about. 'You can't do that at Christmas and Easter. It would have a major impact on the number of people coming. Peak trade: The school summer holidays account for a third of theme parks' business . 'If the bill does come through we would have to reduce the number of people we are employing, so it would make a huge difference. I would hope that we would fight our way through it, but some of the smaller attractions would face a much bigger battle to stay open.' Julie was one of 30 leisure industry chiefs who publicly warned of the dangers the bill could create for attractions dependent on summer trade in a letter to the Sunday Telegraph. Their letter said: 'Many in the tourism industry survived the recession by the skin of their teeth. The economic harm provided for within the bill is deeply worrying.

This Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Porto was delayed due to this and was then further delayed due to a fuelling issue at the airport. Passengers on this flight were disembarked and provided with refreshment vouchers. The aircraft departed the following morning at 7.50am. Ryanair sincerely apologised to all passengers affected by these adverse weather delays, which were outside of our control. With this flight and every flight, we always work hard to get our customers to their destination.” Flight: The short flight to Porto from Stansted should usually take just two hours 20 minutes .

In one incident, Spanish police hauled a woman off a plane in Valencia, Spain, before it took off because she had the 'wrong type of hand luggage'. Spanish newspapers said she was judged to have broken the airline’s rule of boarding with only a small package because she was carrying a scroll, which would not fit in her case, and a book. Footage of the incident in 2012 shows the Spanish woman begging to be let on board . as other passengers shout 'shameful, shameful'. Last month, furious French Ryanair passengers launched a revolt and stole from the drink trolley after being faced with 24-hour delay following an emergency landing. Their plane to Paris took off from Rabat, in Morocco, before being forced to land in Madrid because of a medical emergency. It was too late for the flight to land in Paris because of night restrictions by the time it took off again - so the plane stopped in Nantes instead. Passengers were put on a bus to their destination the next day. In May last year, a Ryanair flight was diverted 200 miles to another airport away from its Greek holiday island destination because the pilot said it was 'too dark to land'. The flight from London Stansted to Kefalonia landed at Thessaloniki airport on the Greece mainland instead as a result of the problems.

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . Ukip last night warned they will target Boris Johnson over his support for a migrant amnesty if the Conservatives try to use him to erode their support. Tory sources yesterday confirmed that the London Mayor will be deployed as a ‘Ukip killer’ in next year’s general election, following confirmation that he wants to return to parliament. Mr Johnson has agreed to carry out a tour of key marginal seats, where Conservative strategists believe he may be able to persuade traditional voters who have defected to Ukip to return to the Tory fold. Nigel Farage, right, has warned the Conservative Party that he will target Boris Johnson over migrant amnesty . But Nigel Farage dismissed the threat, saying Ukip would highlight his views on immigration, including support for an amnesty for illegal immigrants. Mr Farage, who was selected to fight Thanet South, in Kent, on Tuesday night, told the Daily Mail: ‘If Boris wants to explain to our voters why he supports an amnesty for illegal immigrants then he is very welcome to – and we will do what we can to help. ‘Of course Boris is very engaging and entertaining and he will appeal to parts of the Tory grassroots. But, as we pointed out yesterday, he is more Oxbridge than Uxbridge - our voters want representatives who stand up for the concerns of ordinary people whose voice is not heard.’ Mr Johnson has been positioning himself as a Eurosceptic recently. But he takes a much softer line on immigration than either Ukip or David Cameron. As recently as April this year, he attacked the government’s ‘crazy’ immigration crackdown, and he has spoken out repeatedly in favour of an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for years – a policy that even Nick Clegg has now abandoned. Mr Farage said he was ‘very confident’ that Ukip will win its first seats in parliament next year – and said he would quit as leader if the party fails to make the breakthrough. The Conservative Party are planning to use Boris Johnson's popularity to block the Ukip threat . ‘The old idea that we cannot win seats at Westminster has gone,’ he said. ‘I am very confident we are going to win some seats – I can’t tell you how many – and in a tight, hung parliament we could even hold the balance of power. If that happens we will drive a very hard bargain that makes sure the British people get a full, free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the EU.’ Mr Johnson has been burnishing his Eurosceptic credentials in recent weeks as part of a drive to position him both to take on Ukip and to eventually replace Mr Cameron as Tory leader. In a significant intervention this month, Mr Johnson went much further than the Prime Minister on the possibility leaving the EU, saying Britain had ‘nothing to be afraid’ as it could go on to forge a ‘great and glorious future’ if it cut itself free from the shackles of ‘job-destroying’ Brussels. Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron are said to have made a secret pact under which the Prime Minister would give his old friend and rival a fair wind to return to Westminster in return for the London Mayor pledging not to destabilise his leadership. Mr Johnson will tour marginal seats in the coming months to drive home the Tory message that voting Ukip risks putting Ed Miliband in Number 10. Speaking in the wake of his decision on Tuesday to ‘whack in’ an application to become Tory MP for the safe west London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, he said: ‘A vote for Ukip will kill our chance of a referendum and a renegotiation on Europe. The EU needs reform and only David Cameron and the Conservatives offer that hope. ‘A vote for Ukip Is a vote for Labour – it will give voters who want change, who want to take powers back, exactly the opposite.’ f0i * .","Tories plan to use Boris Johnson as a 'Ukip killer' during the 2015 election .

UEFA chief Michel Platini committed himself to staying in charge of European football for the next five years and not challenging Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. Platini summoned all 54 European federations to Monaco to tell them he would stand for another term as UEFA supremo next year despite being the confederation's best bet to fight Blatter for the FIFA crown. But Platini made it clear that he wanted to work for UEFA - ensuring beyond any doubt that Blatter will be elected for another four-year term in 2015 as he already has the support of five confederations around the world.. Not standing: Michel Platini has ruled himself out of the running for the FIFA President's job . Veteran: 78-year-old Sepp Blatter has been the president of FIFA since 1998 . Platini said: 'This was my choice based on my passion. May be one day I will be moving on but not yet. I want to go to the end of my contract with UEFA and there is stlll a few years until the end. 'I chose from my heart, from football and from passion. I am more committed then ever to developing football in Europe.' However the UEFA President was a lot less aggressive towards FIFA and Blatter than many of the delegates expected him to be. Platini said: 'European football has never been stronger. My goal is not to attack FIFA as some of you were expecting me do. But what interests me is UEFA and only UEFA. I hope somebody opposes Mr Blatter, but it will not be me. Backtrack: Platini had previously called for a 'breath of fresh air' at the top of FIFA . 'I have helped Mr Blatter in the past, but I will not be supporting him in the next selection. It's not a debate between UEFA and FIFA. I still respect Mr Blatter, but I will not back him in 2015.' Platini, having confirmed his desire to stay at the helm of UEFA, now wants Europe to be united around the FIFA ExCo table. Platini said: 'The UEFA members on FIFA should bring ideas to the table. They should not always be sheep saying yes and allowing Mr Blatter to be omnipresent.'

"By . Nicola Rowe . Playing video games really may have helped Prince Harry spot the enemy faster, research suggests. Researchers say that video game consoles help the brain to make better and faster use of visual input, distinguishing between one object and another - such as a ‘good guy’ and a ‘bad guy’ - more quickly. Prince Harry famously said that he . trained for flying Apaches by playing on the computer, and a study by . Duke University in America suggests there was some truth in his comment. Prince Harry wearing his monocle gun sight and sitting in his Apache helicopter cockpit in Afghanistan in 2012. He famously said that he trained for flying Apaches by playing on the computer . Professor Greg Appelbaum said: 'Gamers see the world differently. They are able to extract more information from a visual scene.' Researchers found 125 participants who were either non-gamers or very intensive gamers then ran them through a visual sensory memory task that flashed a circular arrangement of eight letters for just one-tenth of a second. After a delay ranging from 13 milliseconds to 2.5 seconds, an arrow appeared, pointing to one spot on the circle where a letter had been. Participants were asked to identify which letter had been in that spot. At every time interval, intensive players of action video games outperformed non-gamers in recalling the letter. Earlier research has found that gamers are quicker at responding to visual stimuli and can track more items than non-gamers. Researchers say that video games help the brain to make better and faster use of visual input, distinguishing between one object and another - such as a ‘good guy’ and a ‘bad guy’ - more quickly . Prof Appelbaum said that when playing a game, especially one of the 'first-person shooters,' a gamer makes 'probabilistic inferences' about what he’s seeing - good guy or bad guy, moving left or moving right - as rapidly as he can. With time and experience, the gamer apparently gets better at doing this. He said, 'They need less information to arrive at a probabilistic conclusion, and they do it faster.' 1.

Dead Island: Riptide . Both groups experienced a rapid decay in memory of what the letters had been, but the gamers outperformed the non-gamers at every time interval. Dr Appelbaum said that the visual system sifts information out from what the eyes are seeing, and data that isn’t used decays quite rapidly. Gamers discard the unused stuff just about as fast as everyone else, but they appear to be starting with more information to begin with. The researchers examined three possible reasons for the gamers’ apparently superior ability to make probabilistic inferences. Either they see better, they retain visual memory longer or they’ve improved their decision-making. Looking at these results, Applebaum said, it appears that prolonged memory retention isn’t the reason. But he said that the other two factors might both be in play, suggesting that it is possible that the gamers see more immediately, and they are more able to make better and accurate decisions from the information they have available.","Gamers 'extract more information from visual scenes than non-gamers'

Tyson Fury will take on Belarusian giant Alexander Ustinov on Saturday - the man his original opponent Dereck Chisora was sparring when he fractured his hand. Fury has boxed just once in the last 15 months and looked set to endure yet more frustration after Chisora pulled out, but he has now accepted the fight with the 37-year-old in Manchester. Ustinov, who at 6ft 7in is still two inches shorter than Fury, has lost just once as a professional - to the undefeated Kubrat Pulev.

It was during his final sparring session with Chisora on Friday that the Londoner broke his left hand but he waited until Monday to announce his decision to pull out. The heavyweight rematch had been expected to be rescheduled for September but that must now be in considerable doubt. Ustinov was last in the ring in November when he outpointed David Tua and will present an altogether different challenge than the shorter, stockier Chisora. 'The first thing is I’m happy to still be fighting this . Saturday and that the fans will get what they paid for and see a good fight,' said Fury.

Fury said he plans to fight under the Irish flag as he holds an licence with the Boxing Union of Ireland. His latest brush with the Board comes after he aimed an expletive-laden tirade at a journalist during a press conference. When the journalist asked Fury if he had any respect for the sport, he retorted: 'If you don't like the station, change the channel b****. 'This is my show, I do what I want. This is boxing, it isn't tap-dancing. If anybody doesn't like that they shouldn't be here. 'I'm in fight mode, kill-mode. I don't apologise, it is what it is.' He also used explicit language when talking about Chisora, David Haye and world champion Wladimir Klitschko. The Board later issued a statement to say that Fury's licence would be revoked if he did not turn up to the hearing.

'Chi O go no n*****!!!!!' reads the caption from a sister at the University of Alabama's Chi Omega sorority in Tuscaloosa. The responsible sister has since been kicked out of the chapter, which just that day had pledged two African American women. Scandal: This photo showing women from Chi Omega's chapter at the University of Alabama purportedly included a caption with the racial epithet . A message appeared on the national Chi Omega Fraternity Facebook condemning the message on Monday. 'What was . expressed is absolutely reprehensible and completely inconsistent with . Chi Omega's values and policies,' said the organization's post. 'Chi Omega took swift . disciplinary action in accordance with the organization's policies and . procedures.' It also said that 'The Chi Omega chapter at the University of Alabama pledged a diverse group of young women, which included several new members who self-identified as minorities, including two African-American women.' That information was supported by university newspaper The Crimson White, which tweeted '[...] All 16 Panhellenic sororities participating in recruitment offered bids to African American women.' Sisterhood: Two African-Americans reportedly pledged Chi Omega at the University of Alabama. The sorority members from a previous year are seen here . The woman responsible and the other sisters in the photo had yet to come forward as of Tuesday, but someone took the time to anonymously email Sorority humor blog Total Sorority Move with denials that the poster meant to use the racist epithet at all. 'The snap was, apparently, an auto correct from the word ""ninjas"" to “n*****,""' one tipster told the website. 'These so-called ""ninjas"" are, after how alabama rush works, a sorority gets stuck with girl that weren’t their top picks. The reason these dumb, non proofreading chi o’s were so happy was that they got a ""perfect pledge class"" this rush season. Now, don’t get me wrong, being a part of the alabama greek system there is a tradition of racism, but it stems from alumni in sororities not usually the actives.'

The Swiss star sailed through to the men's final with a straight sets victory against the young Canadian on Centre Court.

Federer's stoic march through the field left him conceding he had almost produced the perfect route to the final. 'I'd say so,' he said when asked if he had found almost the perfect fortnight so far. 'I've played some great tennis, under pressure at times, because I didn't play so well here last year and I expect a lot of myself here.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It goes against everything we've been told about sun worshiping. But a new study has shown that women who avoid sunbathing during the summer are twice as likely to die than those who sunbathe everyday. Researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden claim guidelines which advise people to stay out of the sun unless wearing sun lotion may be harming us, rather than helping us. Could sunbathing be good for us? Researchers say guidelines advising us to stay out of the sun may be harmful . Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight is often cited as a cause of skin melanoma and the NHS recommends avoiding overexposure to the sun to prevent all types of skin cancer. But after following nearly 30,000 women over 20 years, the new research found that women who stay out of the sun are at increased risk of skin melanomas and are twice as likely to die from any cause, including cancer. The study's lead author, Dr Pelle Lindqvist, said: 'The results of this study clearly showed that mortality was about double in women who avoided sun exposure compared to the highest exposure group. 'Sun exposure advice which is very restrictive in countries with low solar intensity might in fact be harmful for women’s health. Essential: Our bodies need vitamin D, created through exposure to sunlight, to reduce the risk of illness . 'The mortality rate was increased two-fold among avoiders of sun exposure as compared to those with the highest sun exposure habits.' A lack of vitamin D, which is created through exposure to the sun, is thought to be to blame, as it is known to increase the risk of diabetes, rickets, tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis. Prof Dorothy Bennett, Professor of Cell Biology at St George's, University of London, said: 'The findings support the consensus that the ideal amount of sun exposure for Northern Europeans is ‘a little’, rather than zero. 'As the authors comment, our bodies need sunlight to make essential vitamin D, which can help us resist some cancer types. 'Those who normally avoid the sun and/or cover most of their skin are advised to take vitamin D supplements.' The research was published in The Journal of Internal Medicine.","Ultraviolet radiation from the sun thought to be cause of skin melanomas .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Andy Murray's trusted lieutenant Dani Vallverdu is believed to have considered his future with the deposed Wimbledon champion in the wake of Wednesday's Wimbledon quarter final letdown. With Amelie Mauresmo having departed back to France there was still no official word from the Murray camp about how their discussions of Friday had concluded, with issues still apparently to be resolved. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andy Murray play mixed doubles with coach Amelie Mauresmo . Support team: Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo (right) and Dani Vallverdu at Wimbledon . Among them, according to well-placed sources, are the frustrations of the 28-year-old Venezuelan who for nearly four years has been a constant at the side of Murray, who he first met when they were fellow teenage students at a Barcelona Tennis Academy. Vallverdu's influence in the recent career of Murray and his major successes tends to have been underrated as he has worked largely in the shadow of high profile figures like Ivan Lendl and, for the past few weeks, Mauresmo. While he has got on well with the French former player, as Murray has done, a point of contention to said to have been the manner of her appointment. While Vallverdu was kept in the loop throughout the process of Lendl being brought in, he and other members of the backroom staff are said to have been taken by surprise that talks with Mauresmo were as far as advanced as they were in Paris. That has added to a growing sense of being under-appreciated, which may have been exacerbated by what happened on Wednesday. While year-round Murray watchers will know that outbursts at his box are nothing new, the focus is much magnified at Wimbledon. Fallout: Murray's quarter-final exit at Wimbledon has led to him having to re-assess his team . Call: Fitness coach Jez Green (second right) wants a clear structure in backroom team . Lendl would go out of his way to praise Vallverdu's role in a team that is clearly under general evaluation by Murray as he plots how to get back towards the top after his ranking slides to number ten on Monday. During the Czech's increasingly long absences towards the end of the partnership Vallverdu, who last night denied he was about to jump ship, was the ever-present. His role remains vital as it is clear that, even if Mauresmo continues, she does not want to travel full-time on the tour. For instance Murray is now keen to restart training soon in Miami and he would be expected to supervise that while she takes a holiday. He is said to want assurances about his role and stature within the team. Other members, such as the influential Florida-based fitness trainer Jez Green, are also believed to be demanding that a clear structure is established going forward if Mauresmo is going to be in for the long haul. Vallverdu, a mild-mannered and genial former top American college player who is very well-liked on the tour, knows Murray better than anyone. As well as having a good tennis brain he understands the 27 year-old Scot's moods and rage for perfection and if he ever left it would be a major blow.","Murray's trusted lieutenant Dani Vallverdu considered his future .
