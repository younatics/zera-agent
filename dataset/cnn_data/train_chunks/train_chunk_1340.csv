"The front-page consisted of 1,000 Russian planes raiding towns in Finland, two royal birthdays and prisoners locking their own guards in cells. Also in the first Boxing Day edition of the Daily Mail in the Second World War was a story about a father accidentally running over his own daughter. And the newspaper on December 26, 1939 carried a feature on George VI's Christmas broadcast to millions of listeners from Sandringham in Norfolk. Scroll down for video . Plane raids and Christmas messages: The Daily Mail's front page on the first Boxing Day during the Second World War, in 1939 . He said of the approaching New Year: ‘If it brings peace, how thankful we shall all be. If it brings us continued struggle we shall remain undaunted.’ The King’s comments came ahead of a Russian raid on Finland, with two attacks on Helsinki and a 'large number of casualties' reported. There was also a report in the newspaper - which cost one penny - of both sides in the war declaring a voluntary and unofficial 'armistice' for Christmas. The article went on to say: 'Turkey and plum pludding were enjoyed by our troops, in ships at sea and in Air Force messes' In the news: Three of the front-page stories were a driver running over his daughter, a prison riot in Northern Ireland and the King's broadcast . Elsewhere, a driver named John Townsley, of Coldstream in the Scottish Borders, was tragically said to have run over his 19-year-old daughter Helen. A report stated that he was 'motoring home with his wife and friends after a dance when he felt his car hit something', before finding it was his daughter. The family had organised the dance for soldiers in the town, and Miss Townsley had been walking along a lane while seeing a friend home in the dark. Meanwhile a jail riot was reported at Londonderry Prison in Northern Ireland, with inmates setting fire to bedding and smashing furniture. Break in fighting: Other articles in the newspaper included a piece on Christmas for troops on the Western Front (left), and two royal birthdays . A report said prisoners 'overpowered five warders, locked them in cells, barricaded a door, and maintained a siege' in a part of the jail. But they eventually surrendered after armed police arrived, plumbers burned through the doors and firemen turned a hose on the prisoners. One of the photographs on the Mail's front-page was of the Duchess of Gloucester celebrating her 38th birthday on Christmas Day. Also pictured was Princess Alexandra, daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Kent, who celebrated her third birthday on the same day.","Newspaper edition on Boxing Day 1939 carried feature on George VI's Christmas broadcast from Sandringham .

"The bereft widower of Lynda Bellingham decorated his hotel tree with OXO cubes in a touching tribute to his wife, after flying to Dubai because he cannot spend Christmas here without her. Michael Pattemore went abroad for the festive period because he could not bear to be at home without the 66-year-old, who died from cancer in October. Tonight, Lynda's famous 1984 OXO Christmas advert was screened on ITV after Coronation Street in another poignant tribute to the 'OXO mum'. Michael Pattemore (left), the widower of Lynda Bellingham (right), decorated a hotel tree with OXO cubes, as he flew to Dubai to spend his first Christmas without the 66-year-old . The 59-year-old tweeted that he was hanging the cubes on the tree in tribute to his 'gorgeous wife' It comes as her book, There's Something I've been Dying To Tell You, topped the best-seller list for Christmas, after nine weeks at number one. In a tweet from Dubai, Mr Pattemore - whom Lynda described as her 'rock' - wrote:  'Hi everyone, hear I am in Dubai I have hung the OXO cubes on the hotel Christmas tree in memory of my gorgeous wife xx'. Mr Pattemore had previously travelled to Dubai with Lynda nine years ago, when she surprised him with a trip there for his 50th birthday. After his wife's death, Mr Pattemore told how he wanted to return to the middle east this Christmas in a bid to bring back happy memories, rather than being at home alone without her. Tonight, Lynda's best-known OXO advert from 1984 was aired on ITV after Coronation Street in a touching tribute to the TV star . Mr Pattemore posted a second photo of the tree, which was adorned with the stock cubes advertised by Lynda. She died in October after a year-long battle with colon cancer . In a tweet from his hotel, the 59-year-old posted a picture of the tree, saying: 'People are walking around and think we are mad !!!!! Merry Christmas to you all and thank for making Lynda No 1 xxx.' He then posted to say: 'Hope you all enjoy the commercial tonight Lynda is with us all love Michael xxxx' Lynda's most famous role in the OXO adverts kept her on British TV screens for almost two decades. She also presented a number of TV shows and took part in the 2009 series of Strictly Come Dancing. Michael, who has been described as Lynda's 'rock', flew to Dubai to recreate memories from his 50th birthday, when Lynda took him there as a surprise . He previously told how he could not bear to be in the UK for his first Christmas with his beloved wife, who was known as the 'OXO mum' Before Lynda's death, the Loose Woman star had revealed plans to end her chemotherapy but said she hoped to spend one last Christmas with her family. She fought her cancer in the open, appearing on television and radio talking about her illness and her decision to stop her treatment. The actress and presenter insisted death should be confronted and discussed and made it her mission to transform it into a 'positive' thing. Lynda (pictured, left, in 1976 when she appeared in 'Yus My Dear') was known for a host of TV roles, including being a contestant in the 2009 series of Strictly Come Dancing (right) Writing in The Mail on Sunday, she said: ‘I would love to make one more Christmas, if possible, but I want to stop taking chemo around November in order to pass away by the end of January.' She also appeared on Loose Women to talk about her decision to end treatment. But she died, in her husband's arms, just 11 days after the television appearance. The cancer had also spread to her lungs and liver. Her death was met with an extraordinary outpouring of grief from the celebrity and acting world. Since Lynda's death from bowel cancer, Mr Pattemore has been raising money for her oncologist Professor Justin Stebbing's charity Action Against Cancer.","The 66-year-old died in October after a year-long battle with colon cancer .

"Gamers have slammed hackers who knocked out Playstation and Xbox networks on the  day millions received consoles for Christmas. The online networks which allow game players to get the most out of their new machines went down yesterday, leaving many youngsters frustrated and parents furious. Notorious hacking group Lizard Squad, who had previously brought down both networks earlier this month, claimed responsibility for the sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. As the disruption dragged on into a second day today, many desperate gamers sent messages to the group on Twitter, urging them to return service to normal. Scroll down for video . Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service . In one of hundreds of similar messages, Andrew Quintero wrote: 'Could you guys please let PSN back on?' Others, such as London's Luca Rizzo, turned their anger on the companies, calling on them to improve security. He wrote: '@XboxSupport when is online going to be back on? This is a joke were missing out on xmas gaming because of a hack! We want answers!' Microsoft and Sony both used Twitter to acknowledge the issues and to assure users that they were doing everything they could to restore their services. At 2:30pm this afternoon, the Playstation's network was offline and, while many Xbox Live services were up and running, the service's status was described as 'limited'. On Boxing Day morning, Xbox support tweeted: 'Some Xbox One users may currently be experiencing issues signing into Xbox Live.' Around the same time, Playstation's support team posted: 'Our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today. Thanks for your continued patience!' Hundreds took to Twitter today to complain about being unable to connect to the console's networks . The hack left gamers unable to play online and also impacted online components of hugely popular games such as Call of Duty, Madden, FIFA and The Sims 4. Occasional downtime is par for the course for both services, but Christmas Day is a particularly bad time to be hacked, just as hundreds of thousands of PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones were being unwrapped and set up for the first time. Lizard Squad had first announced earlier this month plans to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day. It described itself as the 'next generation Grinch.' Another hacker group, The Finest Squad, then emerged, saying that it would stop the group and bring its members to justice. The Finest Squad tweeted at about 5pm ET that they had Xbox 'pretty much restored.' The problems may have been exacerbated by Sony's decision to let consumers download the controversial movie The Interview through Xbox Video as well as other online sources. Lizard squad is a hacking collective who have claimed responsibility for a series of hacks on games networks. This year the group has been linked to cyber attacks on EA games, Destiny and previous hacks of Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network. Threats posted after a previous  hack on Xbox Live claimed it wouldn't be the last. They wrote: 'Microsoft will receive a wonderful Christmas present from us.' Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch' It had previously been alleged the group used a Russian internet domain, leading to claims they were based in that country. However, it was claimed online today that they are in fact a group made up of one Canadian, three men from the US and two from the UK. One of the men from Britain declined to comment on the claims when contacted by MailOnline, another was unavailable. The hack left gamers unable to play online and also impacted online components of hugely popular games such as Call of Duty, Madden, FIFA and The Sims 4 . Microsoft used Twitter on Christmas Day to keep gamers updated about the issues impacting on Xbox Live . There was anger on Twitter today as parents and youngsters expressed fury at not being able to use their expensive Christmas presents properly. Wigan's Christine tweeted: 'Why hack Xbox & Playstation on Xmas day to stop kids playing with there presents....modern day Scrooge' Another website user added: 'Can't believe people have nothing better to do on Xmas than to hack into Xbox Live and play station network and shut them down' And IT tecnicial Jon Massey wrote: 'Cant figure out why they would hack Xbox + PSN. Way to spoil the Christmas for the kids who were lucky enough to get consoles...' Three Xbox platforms were affected by the service problem: Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Xbox on other devices, Microsoft's status website said. 'I have the nation on strings,' Lizard Squad wrote on its Twitter site. It also said it would put the sites back online if enough people retweeted its messages. Sony also used Twitter to keep PlayStation Network users abreast of the issues it was facing . Rival hacker group, The Finest Squad, claimed via Twitter on Christmas Day that they had restored Xbox Live . In the past, Lizard Squad have overloaded both Microsoft and Sony's gameplay services, as well as Blizzard's online gaming network. Distributed denial-of-service attacks or DDoSing - occurs when massive numbers of people or automated machines flood servers with external data requests, crippling the computers to the point where they grind to a halt and are effectively frozen. This is what happened when Lizard Squad attacked the Blizzard and PlayStation Network servers in August. It is unclear exactly who or what Lizard Squad are or what they are demanding. The group communicates through Twitter - usually posting messages warning of upcoming attacks or flagging up current ones. Various reports suggest that the group is based in Russia - although this has not been proved. A link on the Lizard Squad Twitter page, leading to a chat room login - was originally Russian-based domain.","Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service were hacked .

"Corporal Eric Rowden mingled with the Germans during the 1914 Christmas truce, exchanging buttons with one enemy soldier . When Corporal Eric Rowden heard the enemy shouting ‘Happy Xmas’ late on Christmas Eve, he was understandably apprehensive. But to his astonishment, as the mist lifted over the top of the trenches on December 25, 1914, he saw German soldiers walking about and waving. After a morning of playing football with his colleagues in the 16th Battalion of the London Regiment, the young soldier mingled with the Germans and exchanged buttons with a man he had been trying to kill the previous day. Now the rare uniform button has gone on display in the Imperial War Museum as part of the First World War Galleries collection. The poignant scenes were described in a memoir given to the London museum, along with the button, by Cpl Rowden’s family. The button spent the war pinned to an English postcard on which the German soldier, Werner Keil, had written his name. Cpl Rowden, who was 20 on the day of the Christmas truce in 1914, wrote in a memoir: ‘They were calling in broken English and French, “comrade, Happy Xmas”, and all that and saying they wanted peace on Xmas day. ‘We kept a sharp lookout all night but nothing happened. But next day after it was light and the mist had lifted, we saw them walking about on the top of the trenches and waving to us, so it was not long before we were doing the same and playing football behind our trenches. 'In the afternoon we went out and met them on “no man’s land”. I went out and found a German who spoke English a little and we exchanged buttons and cigarettes and I had two or three cigars given to me and we laughed and joked together.’ Anthony Richards, curator of documents and sound at the museum, said the button was ‘incredibly rare’. He told the Mail: ‘While we know from contemporary accounts that souvenirs were exchanged between British and German soldiers involved in the Christmas truce, surviving examples of such mementos with proven provenance are incredibly rare. 'The German uniform button kept by Eric Rowden is therefore an extremely unusual and important item, especially as it is accompanied by the postcard bearing the German’s name and unit as well as Rowden’s own detailed account of the Truce. ‘We are delighted to look after such an important collection.’ The torn postcard, complete with thumb-print marks and creases, suggests Cpl Rowden may have carried the button around with him for the rest of the war .

The torn postcard, complete with thumb-print marks and creases, suggests Cpl Rowden may have carried the button around with him for the rest of the war. Alongside his name, Werner Keil also wrote Zwickau, referring to a city in Saxony, Germany, presumably where he was from. The day after the Christmas truce, Cpl Rowden left the trenches to go on leave back to England. He joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in October 1915 and continued to serve in France. In December 1916, he fell ill and was sent to Michelham Convalescent Home in the south of France, where he was treated for shell shock. For his wartime service, he was awarded the 1914 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Cpl Rowden, of Chiswick in West London, died in 1968, at the age of 73.","Corporal Eric Rowden was given a button during the 1914 Christmas truce .

"Victim: Nikki Allan was killed just yards from her home in Sunderland in 1992 . Police have arrested a 43-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a seven-year-old girl more than twenty years ago. Officers from Northumbria Police said the man was taken into custody this morning over the death of Nikki Allan, who was found dead in Sunderland in 1992. He is currently being questioned by police. Nikki was found after a brutal attack where she was, beaten with a brick stabbed 37 times. The young girl had vanished after leaving her grandparents’ flat, in Wear Garth, to walk to her home, just 150 yards away. Her shoes were discovered outside the Old Exchange building a few hundred yards away the next morning. Her body was found inside the building by a neighbour helping police with the search. An investigation has been open ever since. A number of people were arrested in connection with the killing, but no one was convicted. Police say new information leading to today's was given to police after a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of her last movements. Ahead of the programme, Detective . Superintendent Ford said: 'This was an extremely brutal attack on a . defenceless seven-year-old girl and 21 years after it happened it’s . still talked about in Sunderland and the local area. 'Nikki’s family have been left devastated by what happened and we will never give up trying to find her killer. 'Technology . and forensic investigation techniques are improving all of the time and . it’s our hope that these advances along with new information from the . public could lead to us finding out who murdered her.' A spokesman said officers: 'are particularly keen to speak to anyone who lived in the Wear Garth area at the time of the murder or anyone who hung around or inside the Old Exchange Building.' Scene: Nikki was found insidethe Old Exchange building, pictured in 1992 . Nikki's mother Sharon Henderson, 47, today spoke of her shock after finding out about the arrest. Ms Henderson has campaigned for years to get justice for her daughter and was visited by officers earlier today with the news. 'Never given up': Nikki's mother Sharon says she still believes the killer can be found . She received word of the arrest in hospital today, where she is recovering from a collapse which doctors say may be linked to the stress of her campaign. She said: 'I am just in total shock, I can't believe it. Everything I have worked towards in the past two decades has finally materialised. 'It makes all the stress, all the campaigning worth while. But the news still hasn't sunk in, and I don't know who has been arrested. 'When the police arrived at the hospital to deliver the news I assumed they had come to check I was OK. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard the news. I just feel overwhelmed with emotion.' 'This is what I have been hoping for all these years. I hope that Nikki is finally getting the justice she deserves. I am waiting for the police to tell me who the suspect is.' Sources have also said that the arrested man was not George Heron, who was cleared of her murder after a trial in 1993. Mr Heron was acquitted despite apparently making a confession after a judge ruled he had been dealt with oppressively by police. Nikki's mother Sharon Henderson subsequently won a civil claim against him, and he was ordered to pay her £7,000. Anyone who thinks they have any information that could help detectives with their inquiries is asked to contact police on 101 ext 69191.","Nikki Allan was found dead in derelict building in Sunderland 21 years ago .

"Tim Howard has urged Everton’s fans to be patient and accept that manager Roberto Martinez will not switch to a more direct brand of football. During the last home game against Queen Park Rangers, the Goodison Park crowd was noticeably tense and anxious as Everton’s players moved the ball around and there was a point when one backpass to Howard was greeted with noisy discord. Everton won plaudits last season for the style of football they played under Martinez as they accrued a club-record points tally (73) in the Barclays Premier League and returned to Europe for the first team in five years. Tim Howard has urged Everton’s fans to be patient and stick with the players during this difficult period . He also told fans to accept that manager Roberto Martinez will not switch to a more direct brand of football . Things have not been so straightforward this time around, as Everton’s form has been erratic and the tension among supporters is as much to do with the club’s position in the table as it is with the slow tempo of their play. Howard, though, has explained that Martinez will not be abandoning his principles just to get a few results on the board and he accepts that could mean the atmosphere at Goodison being prickly, starting this afternoon against Stoke. ‘Winning cures everything,’ said Howard. ‘If you could pick the ball up and throw it in with your hands, then people would cheer for that. When wins aren’t coming as regularly as you would hope, there is an edginess. ‘It doesn’t matter whether you are kicking the ball up in the air or passing it on the floor. 'The fans want wins but, trust me, we want them even more. We are not robots. We hear the crowd. But we are a passing team and we are not going to get away from it. Roberto doesn’t bat an eye at it. Martinez and his Everton side lost 3-0 to Southampton in their last Premier League outing . But Martinez has said that the team's style of play is not to blame, and that his players need to perform better . ‘He encourages us to pass the ball and it is proven we can win games that way. He has been in charge for 18 months and it has been very positive. There will be no change. I love these fans and they are passionate. But I fight with my brother, too. Do you know what I mean? ‘You don’t always have to agree. I have always had a good rapport and banter with them. That will never change.’ This is Howard’s ninth season on Merseyside but there is no sense that he is approaching the end of the line in terms of contributing; he has been one of Everton’s more key performers this year and his durability and consistency means he has long since paid back the £3.5million it cost to sign him.

He arrived at Everton, initially on loan, from Manchester United under a cloud as his form had tailed towards the end of his spell at Old Trafford.

The first instinct is to go back to America. That is why most US players fail. I was always going to make it here. ‘I knew I had to get my career back on track, so there was a lot of stuff there in that first year for me to deal with. But my self-belief never wavered.

"Killer: Steven Grieveson, 42, (pictured) was convicted today of murdering Simon Martin in 1990 after confessing his crime to police . A serial killer who strangled three teenage boys in the nineties has been convicted of the murder of a fourth. Steven Grieveson, 42, was already serving three life sentences when he confessed to killing 14-year-old Simon Martin in 1990. He told officers that he had lured the boy to an abandoned building after playing football with him. Grieveson, a former fairground worker and kitchen assistant, then confessed to sexually abusing Simon, before strangling him and bludgeoning his face with a rock. He denied murder at Newcastle Crown Court, claiming he had diminished responsibility because he had mental problems. But after a nine-day trial the jury today found him guilty, and he was sentenced to at least 35 years in jail. The notorious killer had previously been found guilty of killing three other teenagers - Thomas Kelly, 18, David Hanson, 15 and David Grieff, also 15, between 1993 and 1994. He strangled all three of them and burned their bodies to hide the evidence. But the murder of Simon in May 1990 had remained a mystery for years after his remains were found in the abandoned house a week after he was murdered. Grieveson did not give evidence during the trial, but the court heard it reported that he claimed all four deaths were accidents. He said he killed them unintentionally while he was threatening his victims to ensure they did not tell anybody that he was bisexual. Grieveson told police last year that after performing a sex act with Simon he killed him on a mattress in a room at Gillside House in Roker, Sunderland. He said: ‘After it was finished I got scared and . I started shouting at him not to tell anyone. ‘I just flipped, I flipped, just flipped for a minute then I started strangling him then, I don’t know, I didn’t let go. ‘The . next thing he was on the bed and I got scared and I think there was a . rock or something and I smashed his head in. Victim: Steven Grieveson told police that he strangled Simon Martin (pictured) after sexually abusing him, then bludgeoned his face with a rock . 'It was haunting me for 20 years. I have self-harmed because of it. It drove me crazy and I needed to give the family peace of mind and peace of mind for myself as well. I can't move forward unless this has been said. Grieveson had kept quiet when investigators questioned him in the past, and said nothing when a former schoolmate was charged with the murder. The case against the innocent man was eventually dropped. Simon, who lived in Sunderland with his . parents Robert and Jean, was last seen alive on May 18 1990 when he went . to play out with friends at 5pm. The court heard he was told to be home for his tea by 6pm. But prosecutor William Lowe told jurors: ‘He never came home.’ Simon was reported missing that night and his body was found by two children playing in the disused house a week later. Murdering spree: Grieveson, left, pictured as a . teenager playing football and right, leaving Newcastle Crown Court in . custody in 1996 during his trial for the murders of Thomas . Kelly, David Hanson and David Grieff . The body of Simon Martin was found at Gillside House, Sunderland, pictured. It has since been demolished . He had died as a result of brain injury, with compression of the neck a contributing factor. The court also heard that Grieveson had told a woman who visited him in jail that 'the need to kill took him over' when he murdered the boys. The woman, who told detectives she was writing a book about the killings, was said to have given gifts and money to the killer in order to 'manipulate' him. Grieveson, who was flanked by five guards throughout the trial, showed no emotion as his crimes were described to the jury. Murdered: David Grieff (pictured) was murdered during a four month killing spree by Steven Grieveson between 1993 and 1994 . Strangled: David Hanson, left, and Thomas Kelly, . right, were murdered by Steven Grieveson in the early nineties it is . believed he used violence to keep them quiet after sex, or to force them . into engaging in homosexual acts . He called on expert evidence in an attempt to show he had a severe mental condition that led to him killing Simon. Professor . Derek Perkins told the court during the trial Grieveson has . ‘psychopathic traits’ to his personality which, mixed with . vulnerabilities which makes for a ‘dangerous combination’. Grief: Simon Martin's father robert (pictured) saw the sentencing at court today and read a statement afterwards . The . professor said: ‘His lack of emotion, callousness, lack of remorse are . elements that would have contributed to his ability to kill, more than . once.’ Grieving members of Grieveson’s victims’ families staged a daily vigil in the public gallery to hear what had happened during their sons’ final moments. It was on 26 November 1993 Thomas Kelly’s body was found burning in an allotment shed behind Monkwearmouth Hospital. On 8 February 1994 David Hanson’s charred remains were found in a derelict house in Roker. And on 25 February 1994 David Grieff’s body was found in an allotment shed at the rear of Monkwearmouth Hospital. Grieveson was sentenced for the fourth murder this afternoon, after the court was adjourned, though he decided not to be in court for the sentencing. Mr Justice Ramsey said: ‘You are a sexual predator. You will murder young . boys or men who do not comply with your wishes for sexual . gratification. 'Precisely what happened is known only to you. There is powerful evidence you strangled him as part of a sexual act then gratuitously smashed his skull. ‘I hope the family of Simon Martin . can now feel there has been some closure of this case, justice has been . done and they can now move on with their life.’ Speaking outside of court, Simon's father Robert Martin gave a statement to reports on behalf of his family. He thanked the police and investigators who brought the case to justice, and said: 'It has been traumatic and life changing for all the families. 'Traumatic and life-changing': Mr Martin gives a statement outside of Newcastle Crown Court today . ‘Now, Grieveson will spend the rest of his days behind bars. ‘No other family should suffer the heartache we have had to go through and I am sure the families behind me agree. ‘Our sons were taken away from us by a cruel man whose despicable actions cost four boys their lives. ‘These were innocent boys whose actions led in no way to their devastating and tragic deaths.’","Steven Grieveson, 42, was convicted of murder at Newcastle Crown Court .

"Jamie Donaldson has some advice for the US taskforce looking to end their embarrassing series of defeats against Europe in the Ryder Cup, and it's really rather simple: just enjoy it. Europe have won eight of the last 10 Ryder Cups and the secret to their success, according to Donaldson, is nothing but having fun together. The Welshman - whose stunning wedge to two feet of the pin was the shot that sealed the cup for Paul McGinley's side at Gleneagles last month - said that laughter helped them to cope when their opponents piled on the fiercest pressure. Jamie Donaldson tees off at the 10th hole during the BMW Shanghai Masters on Thursday . Ballantine’s asked Donaldson to name a defining moment, or ‘Moment of Truth’, in his golfing history, with the player signing his answer on the camera. Donaldson wrote ‘My first win!’ in reference to his Irish Open victory . The Welshman celebrates with the Ryder Cup after his starring role in Europe's victory . 'It’s difficult to comment on the American team but we seemed to just gel better as a team and enjoy the experience,' said Donaldson. 'When the European team gets together we have a thoroughly good craic and enjoy each other’s company, which helps us play well under pressure in my view.' Donaldson tees it up at the BMW Masters in Shanghai this week hoping to cap the most special year of his career with a big victory in one of the European Tour's flagship Final Series events. He made a promising start, shooting a four-under-par round of 68 to sit in sixth place, three shots behind leader Alexander Levy. CLICK HERE to read a report of the first round . But for years, Donaldson was a journeyman pro, a decent player touring the world with no tournament wins to his name, due in no small part to an ongoing back problem. One specialist even advised him to give up golf for good. Thankfully for Europe and McGinley he paid no notice. Donaldson's first victory came at Royal Portrush two years ago and he is now reaching the pinnacle of his career at the age of 39. That laser-guided wedge on the 15th hole of the Centenary Course remains the defining shot not just of his 4&3 victory over Keegan Bradley but also of this year's Ryder Cup. 'It was huge for me and the European team. This has been my most exciting season without doubt,' he said. Donaldson hits the shot that sealed the Ryder Cup - a wedge into the 15th in his match against Keegan Bradley . Phil Mickelson (centre) is one of the big names on the US Ryder Cup taskforce . 'Winning my first European Tour title, the Irish Open in 2012, was pretty special. It had taken a lot of hard work to get that point and a lot of tournaments.'

"Manuel Pellegrini has set Manchester City a target of 87 points to retain their Premier League crown. The champions trail Chelsea by three points going into the trip to West Bromwich but are on course to meet Pellegrini’s mark as they approach the halfway point of the season. Twice in the past three years, City have won the title on the final day after finishing level with Manchester United on 89 points and edging out Liverpool with 86. Manchester City stars looked relaxed in training ahead of the Boxing Day game at The Hawthorns . City's title charge appears to be building up a head of steam ahead of the crucial Christmas period . Manuel Pellegrini has set Manchester City a target of retaining their Premier League title . Pellegrini estimates that this year’s winning total will be somewhere between the two. ‘You must win around 86 or 87 points,’ he said. ‘You have to play for 57 points in the second half of the season and there are still six points in this half, so that’s 63 points. With big teams it’s always important to win titles but we are not thinking about what we did last season, or what happened with Chelsea. ‘You must always forget whatever we did in the past and try to have your mind in the present because every season is different.’ Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic has claimed the leaders are capable of winning a quadruple this season under Mourinho, but Pellegrini speaks from experience when he says that such a feat would be very difficult. City won a Premier League and Capital One Cup double last season, and were in contention for four trophies until March, when they went out of the FA Cup and Champions League in the space of four days. Manchester City's Champions League hopes were dashed by a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona in March . But Pellegrini added the Premier League crown to the Capital One Cup to cap a memorable first season . ‘It’s difficult, especially during December and January,’ said the City boss. ‘They are two months when you have to play nine games each month, like we did last year. ‘You get towards the end of the season, March and April, but you must play semi-finals, finals of the cups. You must be on top of the table too, and you play fewer league games because of the cups. ‘We tried last year and we couldn’t do it for different reasons. It’s always possible — difficult but possible.’ Pellegrini confirmed that Yaya Toure is expected to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast after the FA Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday a week on Sunday and could be unavailable until well into February. That has placed even greater importance on keeping Frank Lampard at the Etihad, with the former England midfielder’s future still unresolved. Frank Lampard (left) is becoming increasingly important to City- especially given Yaya Toure's absence . City are confident that Lampard’s loan from their US sister club New York City will be extended until at least mid-February and possibly for the rest of the season. It is understood that the timing of the announcement is particularly sensitive, with New York preparing for their debut season in Major League Soccer and Lampard a central figure in their plans both on and off the pitch. ‘It’s an internal reason that’s not important,’ said Pellegrini. ‘The important thing is that Frank Lampard stays here. Yes, I’m confident he’ll stay but I can’t say 100 per cent because it doesn’t depend just on me. ‘It’s not so easy because Frank is a New York City player. He’s only on loan until December so we must respect the other people. ‘One of the reasons we asked Frank to play here was because we knew Yaya would be leaving us to go to the Africa Cup of Nations. ‘Yaya will go around January 5-10. We are not exactly sure of the dates but I think maybe the FA Cup game will be the last one. You always want to retain the best players here but you know the rules.’","City have twice won the title on the final day, with 86 points and 89 points, respectively .

"Former President George H.W. Bush will remain hospitalized through Christmas Day after being admitted for shortness of breath. Family spokesman Jim McGrath said Thursday evening that the 90-year-old remained at Houston Methodist Hospital for a third day but 'had another terrific day and is in great spirits'. He said Bush was visited by his wife, Barbara Bush, as well as son Neil Bush, after being hospitalized Tuesday night in what was reported as a precaution. President Barack Obama and first lady lady sent 'their good wishes to the former president and the entire Bush family during this holiday season', according to White House spokesman Eric Schultz, after hearing about Bush's condition while vacationing in Hawaii. Scroll down for video . Hospital for the holidays: George H.W. Bush, 90 - pictured here on November 3 - has spent a third night at Houston Methodist Hospital after being admitted Tuesday for shortness of breath . THe oldest living president's hospitalization was 'out of abundance of caution', a family spokesperson said. He is pictured here at a Houston Texans game on November 23 . Barbara Bush read 'Twas The Night Before Christmas with Houston Texans player JJ Watt at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday before her husband's hospitalization was announced . Bush is the oldest living former American president. He suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him to rely on a motorized scooter or wheelchair. But he's also skydived on at least three of his birthdays since leaving the White House, including a tandem jump for his 90th birthday in June. Bush spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. He was discharged in January 2013, after nearly two months in the hospital. Bush made two public appearances last month. He attended an event at Texas A&M University with his son, former President George W. Bush, and served as the coin-toss captain for the Houston Texans during a Nov. 23 game that honored the US Armed Forces. The elder Bush was a naval aviator in World War II — at one point the youngest in the Navy — and was shot down over the Pacific. Mrs Bush and Watt were the special guests for the Radio City Christmas Spectacular in Houston . Methodist Hospital in Houston is the top-rated hospital in Texas and is nationally ranked, as well . Bush served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president before being elected the nation's 41st president in 1988. After one term, highlighted by the success of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait, he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton amid voters' concerns about the economy. The elder Bush has skydived on at least three of his birthdays since leaving the White House. In June, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. During the winter, Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston. Bush, also a former U.S. ambassador to China and CIA director, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair for mobility. Bush's wife, Barbara Bush, made a surprise visit with Houston Texans' JJ Watt at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in Houston on Tuesday evening to perform 'Twas the Night Before Christmas.' It's not clear whether she was with the 41st U.S. president when he experienced his shortness of breath . Methodist Hospital is rated as the top hospital in Texas by US News & World Report.

"One month and a day after their first data dump of private information stolen while hacking Sony, the now infamous Guardians of Peace seem to have gone quietly into the night, failing to deliver the much hyped 'Christmas gift' they claimed would destroy the studio. 'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift,' the group posted online in mid-December. 'The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state.' Yet days later a letter released by the hackers on December 18 said that Sony had 'suffered enough.' Scroll down for video . People wait in line on Christmas day to watch the first screening of the controversial movie The Interview  in Atlanta, Georgia. The promise of more Sony secrets being revealed has so far failed to materialize . A man wearing a U.S. Flag outfit leads cinema goers in Austin, Texas, in a sing along of Proud To Be An American ahead of a screening of The Interview . Since then the hackers appear to have turned their attention to the FBI and on December 21 they posted a message which cynically 'praised' the FBI's investigation into the hack, with a link yo a video that repeated the phrase 'You are an idiot' repeatedly. On Christmas Day, people flocked to the 300 or so cinemas showing the movie. 'We are taking a stand for freedom,' said theater manager Lee Peterson of the Cinema Village East in Manhattan, where most of Thursday's seven screenings had sold out by early afternoon. 'We want to show the world that Americans will not be told what we can or cannot watch. Personally, I am not afraid.' At Atlanta's Plaza Theater, a sell-out crowd Thursday hailed the film's release, washing down popcorn with beer and cocktails and uniting for a boisterous sing-along of 'God Bless America' before the opening credits. 'This is way more fun than it would have been,' said Jim Kelley of Atlanta, who waited outside with his daughter, Shannon. The elder Kelley added, with mocking sarcasm, 'This is almost dangerous, like we're living life on the edge.' While the Guardians of Peace may be done, a new hacking group has already stepped in and taken their place, managing to shut down the company's PlayStation network at the worst possible time - Christmas Day. Game over: The Sony hack that resulted in the leak of thousands of emails exchanges between Hollywood heavyweights including studio head Amy Pascal (right) and Scott Rudin (left) seems to be over . No backlash: This despite the fact that Sony decided to reverse their decision made last week to shelve the film following threats of a terrorist incident . According to Deadline, a group called Lizard Squad is taking credit for the hack, which managed to put the network out of commission for hours not just once, but twice during the holiday. They are also claiming to have done the same to Xbox Live. This hack pales in comparison however to the damage inflicted on Sony and its employees as a result of the Guardians of Peace hack. And of those employees, no one has had to endure more than studio head Amy Pascal, whose work emails were released on a near daily basis. The hackers began their reign of terror on November 24 by hacking into employee computers and displaying a flashing skull with a cryptic message informing workers 'we've obtained all your internal data.' The computers would remain down for over a week, and a few days later the hackers deliver their first of many shocking dumps when the leak the Brad Pitt war drama Fury as well as unreleased studio titles including Annie, Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love On Her Arms online. It was around this time in late November that speculation began to mount that North Korea was likely behind the hack, a claim that seems to be based on nothing other than the fact that the country's UN ambassador Ja Song Nam wrote a letter to UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon taking issue that a film that depicts the assassination of a sitting world leader was allowed to be made, let alone released. And although the Guardians fail to even address these claims, or make any demands of Sony, until well into December, the story continues to grow and is accepted by many as fact long before the FBI claims to have actual proof of the country's involvement. Deny: Following an FBI report that North Korea was behind the attack, King Jong-un (above) released a statement denying the allegation and attacking the United States . It is in December that the hackers really turn things up, dumping an astonishing amount of information in the first two weeks of the month. Salaries of the company's top executives become public, the script for the new James Bond film is leaked, and then there are the emails attacking an assortment of A-list actors, writers and directors, along with a racist exchange between Pascal and her frequent pen-pal in many of these leaked emails, producer Scott Rudin, in which the two mock President Obama by listing what his favorite movie might be. The two would later release individual public apologies for their comments. This racist exchange is still being addressed by Pascal, who flew to New York to meet with Al Sharpton and has given the go ahead to a new program dedicated to promoting racial diversity in film. Pascal does however manage to come off as respectful and understanding when speaking about many of Hollywood's biggest stars, save one incident in which she labels Adam Sandler an 'a**hole' not once, but twice. Rudin on the other hand seems to have no problem talking about the talent behind their back, particularly Angelina Jolie who he labels 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one email, and in another exchange actually removes from the chain in order to tell Pascal that the actress is 'out of her mind.' During this time the group also starts dumping employee medical records, and most notably there letter on December 8 demanding that Sony stop the release of their upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview. Then, on December 13 with the scandal at near fever pitch, the group announces plans for their upcoming 'Christmas gift' which they say will put Sony 'into the worst state.' Then things go quiet until December 16, when the group follows up their demand by threatening a terrorist attack of any movie theater set to play The Interview when it is released on December 25. Everywhere: The film has now been released across three viewing platforms - theaters, on demand and online . By day's end, the four largest theater chains in the country announce they will not show the film, and the following day Sony cancels the film's release. It is then that the Guardians release the aforementioned December 18 letter saying the Sony has suffered enough. Things finally turned around on Wednesday however for Sony, when Christmas came exactly one day early and the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing The Interview online. Making the release even sweeter for Sony was the massive outpouring of public support for the film, with thousands turning out for Christmas Eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of Americans streaming the film online. And as an added bonus for Sony, the studio will now go down in the history books for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online, as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms - theaters, online and video on demand. 'It has always been Sony's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film,' Sony Pictures chair and CEO Michael Lynton said in a statement. 'We chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day, and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release.' Even more impressive however is how quickly the studio managed to pull this all together after initially deciding to hold off on distributing the film last week. Sony only announced on Tuesday that the film would play in selected theaters and be released to video on demand on Thursday. As for the big online announcement, that was confirmed less than an hour before the movie appeared on Google Play, YouTube, Microsoft Xbox Video and a Sony website created for the film, with the option of renting the film for $5.99 or downloading it for $16.99. There are still questions as to just who was behind the hacking as well, with many experts in the cybersecurity field questioning an FBI report that they say proved North Korea's government masterminded the attack. The experts all firmly believe the hack had to be an inside job.","The 'Christmas gift' data dump that Sony hacking group Guardians of Peace promised two weeks ago hasn't materialized .

The 50-year-old was caught hanging upside down from a piece of gym equipment that is mainly used for strengthening your upper body. Rather than spending time tenuously lifting heavy weights, the cigar-smoking golf star decided to prepare for this weekend's BMW Masters in Shanghai by quite literally hanging around. Spanish golf star Miguel Angel Jimenez hangs upside down during an unusual gym workout . The European Tour's physio unit took to Instagram to show Jimenez larking around in the gym. They wrote: 'Spotted the legend M A Jimenez hanging around in the gym using the equipment in his own unique way!! #bmwmasters'. The European Tour veteran Jimenez, vice-captain for the last two Ryder Cups, doesn't seem to be too worried about the race for the 2016 Ryder Cup captaincy. Northern Irishman Darren Clarke is the early favourite and has the backing of heavyweights like world number one Rory McIlroy, nine-time Ryder Cup star Lee Westwood and two-time major winner Martin Kaymer. Jimenez and his team take part in a Chopstick Challenge during the Pro-Am event prior to the BMW . The Spanish veteran entertains the crowd during the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles . Kaymer, however, said last week the reason behind his thinking was that 2016 was too early for the 43-year-old Bjorn as he was playing too well. The growing campaign behind Clarke also saw Graeme McDowell call for McGinley to put aside differences with the Ulsterman after their friendship cooled when Clarke supported Montgomerie for the Gleneagles captaincy. Jimenez is also a contender and would have the backing of the miracle of Medinah mastermind Jose Maria Olazabal. It is expected a decision on the 2016 captain will be made early next year. Jimenez smokes his cigar and poses with the trophy after winning the Open de Espana in May .","Miguel Angel Jimenez hangs upside down on piece of gym equipment .

"France's Alexander Levy made the ideal start to his bid for a third European Tour title of the season - and second in China - in the BMW Masters on Thursday. Levy, who won the Volvo China Open in April and the rain-shortened Portugal Masters three weeks ago, carded a flawless opening 65 at a damp Lake Malaren to finish seven under par, one shot ahead of compatriot Romain Wattel, Belgium's Nicolas Colsaerts and Argentina's Emiliano Grillo. Starting from the 10th, Levy birdied his first four holes and picked up another shot at the par-three 17th to reach the turn in 31, before recording further birdies at the second and ninth. Alexander Levy has made an impressive start to the BMW Masters as he leads the way on day one . 'I think this country likes me,' joked the 24-year-old. 'For me, this golf course is pretty much the same as the one where I won in Shenzhen. 'I like this type of golf course with water and the target golf. I enjoy being in China and I'm going to try my best the next few days to do the same things I did in April.' Levy is a close friend of both Wattel - whose flawless 66 was achieved despite cracking the face of his driver during the round - and Ryder Cup star Victor Dubuisson, who returned a two-under-par 70 and is helping inspire the new generation of French players. 'No French player has won a major or something like that, but I think we have a good mix between the older generation and young generation,' Levy added. 'Victor played the Ryder Cup this year and I think it showed all the French players it's possible to play a big event like that and be in position to be in the Ryder Cup in France in 2018. 'For my part I'm thinking only about that, to be in France in 2018 at Le Golf National, it's an amazing place. I think we will have, I hope, two or three players on the Ryder Cup in 2018. Graeme McDowell finds himself two shots behind Levy after shaking off jet lag to card a respectable 67 . Oliver Wilson tees off during the first round at Lake Malaren Golf Club in Shanghai . 'We have a good generation. Every year some French players win and new players come on the European Tour.' Graeme McDowell, who won the French Open at Le Golf National earlier this season, was two shots behind Levy after shaking off jet-lag to card a 67 in the first event of the Tour's Final Series. 'I got here Tuesday morning and haven't really been feeling my best the last couple of days,' said McDowell, who was knocked out in the group stage in the defence of his Volvo World Match Play Championship a fortnight ago. 'It's the first sort of long trip of the year for me and the body took a little bit of time to catch up. Thankfully I felt much, much better this morning and the energy level has felt good. 'The golf course is fairly soft due to the rain. It's playing very long (7,600 yards), but the greens are very receptive and you can attack a few pins. 'I've had a lot of yardage in my hand most of the day out there. We counted up, I think I had seven iron shots from outside of 200 yards on this golf course. 'Certainly for a guy like me who doesn't hit it maybe as far as some of the other guys, I have to be precise with my iron play and putt well, and I putted well today. That was one of the keys.' After a disappointing start to the series Justin Rose recovered to sign off for a level-par 72 . McDowell's Ryder Cup team-mates Thomas Bjorn and Jamie Donaldson were among a six-strong group on four under par which also featured England's Oliver Wilson, who won his first European Tour event - the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship - on his 228th appearance at the start of October. Wilson started on the back nine and covered it in 32 before picking up another shot on the third, the 34-year-old dropping his only shot of the day on the ninth when his approach plugged in a greenside bunker. Justin Rose signed for a level-par 72 after recovering from being four over par after his first four holes, the world number six having run up a triple-bogey eight on the par-five 13th. But Ian Poulter struggled to a two-over-par 74 which contained five bogeys and three birdies and left the world number 43 joint 62nd in the 78-strong field.","Alexander Levy bidding for third European title of the season .

"Alan Pardew believes Manchester United under Louis van Gaal are a different proposition from the David Moyes side beaten by Newcastle last December. The Magpies broke a 41-year winless run at Old Trafford when Yohan Cabaye scored the only goal 12 months ago. That defeat left United ninth and Moyes under increasing pressure. Louis van Gaal (right) has restored order at Manchester Unted, says Alan Pardew . Pardew takes his Newcastle troops to Manchester looking for back-to-back wins at Old Trafford . Yohan Cabaye hit the winner last time out, but the Frenchman swapped Tyneside for Paris in summer . Pardew, though, believes Van Gaal’s presence has brought security to the club as well as the team. ‘You can sense a difference between last year and this year,’ said the Newcastle manager. ‘Last year they didn’t seem that secure around David. But they’ve definitely got it this year. There’s a bit more stability with the manager. There was a lot of unstable reporting and messages coming out of there last year and for David that wasn’t working. ‘Van Gaal has had more patience and more time, and more assurance about what’s going on from above. That makes them look as though more good news is going to be arriving than bad. ‘I think the board have made a statement that Van Gaal’s the man and he’s made it very clear he’s their man too. ‘Put that together and they’ve got a great base for those great players, those great strikers. ‘He’s had terrible injuries, like ourselves, but they’ve got a great chance of getting back in the Champions League and that’s what I think they’re pushing for.’ Newcastle will again start  with 21-year-old goalkeeper Jak Alnwick. And that, says Pardew, is a stark contrast to United’s David de Gea, who he believes is challenging Bayern Munich’s Manuel Neuer as the world’s No 1 between the posts. Following his dream debut against Chelsea, Jak Alnwick has found life tougher between the sticks . David De Gea has been a rock at the last line of defence for United, pulling off a string of sensational saves . ‘There’s such a contrast in goal at the moment — Jak is on his third Premier League start and De Gea is pushing Neuer for the title of being the best goalkeeper in the world,’ he said. ‘He’s a fantastic shot-stopper. He still has parts of his game that he wishes to develop, but in one-on-one situations he excels. ‘He covers a lot of the areas goalscorers want to score in by doing so with his feet and his hands. ‘He makes it very difficult to score, so you have to go with power and go for the corners.’ Newcastle, meanwhile, are on the back of three straight defeats and they last won when upsetting League leaders Chelsea 2-1 on December 6. But Pardew (below) is refusing to panic. ‘Against the top teams we’ve done well, we’re ninth in the division and we’re not far away from the top,’ he said. ‘If we get a win today it’s then Everton and Burnley at home and it could put us in a great position. So it’s all to play for. I do think this team is stable, it’s a strong middle-of-the-Premier League team and we need to be better than that if we can. ‘I think this January is important. It’s important that big players come back to us — and we do some business.’","Newcastle won at Old Trafford last season with United rudderless under David Moyes .

"Few managers can appreciate the loss of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge to Liverpool better than Burnley manager Sean Dyche. While the two Liverpool strikers were tearing up the Premier League with 52 goals between them last season, Sam Vokes and Danny Ings were firing Burnley to promotion from the Championship with a combined total of 40 League goals. Vokes has not played this season due to a serious knee injury, though the Wales international could finally return to the squad to face Liverpool at Turf Moor. Sam Vokes poses . Danny Ings has netted four times in 15 Premier League games this season as Burnley battle to beat the drop . Ings was also missing for more than a month with a hamstring problem, and Dyche can fully understand why Brendan Rodgers’ side have suffered without their two main strikers. ‘With all due respect, Vokes and Ings are still learning to be Suarez and Sturridge-type players,’ said Dyche. ‘So if we’re missing them, it’s fair to say that Brendan Rodgers will miss two players like that from his side. Sean Dyche and Ings celebrate after beating Wigan on the way to promotion to the Premier League . Luis Suarez (left) left for Barcelona and Daneil Sturridge has only played three times for Liverpool this season . ‘Liverpool without Suarez and Sturridge look a different unit. Still a good unit, but are they as good? The question remains. ‘Strikers make a difference. That’s why they all drive massive cars, that’s why there is a shortage of them, that’s why the world demands “Can we find a striker?” — because it changes the whole view of the team. ‘Rarely did your dad speak to you about the right back. I remember mine talking to me about Ian Rush and other Liverpool strikers. They make a massive difference to the way a team looks.’","Last season, Sam Vokes and Danny Ings fired Burnley to promotion from the Championship with a combined total of 40 League goals .

"The forgotten victim of English cricket’s civil war has dusted himself down, picked himself up and embarked on the new challenge he hopes will help him recover from the blow of missing out on the top job that looked certain to be his. Ashley Giles was, perhaps, the most unfortunate casualty of the fallout from an Ashes disaster that saw Andy Flower fall on his sword and Kevin Pietersen sacked amid bitterness and rancour that still rumbles on. Giles, 41, had been earmarked to succeed Flower as team director when he was appointed one-day coach almost two years ago but his apprenticeship was nipped in the bud when England’s world came crashing down. Ashley Giles missed out on England's top job in the fall out from the Ashes disaster . One of the heroes of England’s greatest modern Ashes victory a decade ago, Giles was unable to stem the bleeding after taking a wounded team to the World Twenty20 in March and he then found himself forced out in favour of Peter Moores. Now, after a summer of reflection and new experiences, Giles has climbed back on the horse at one of England’s biggest counties and finds himself charged with bringing the good times back to relegated Lancashire. Not only that, but the man who guided Warwickshire to the County Championship title has also taken on a new and very different challenge aimed at providing him with an alternative career when his coaching days are over. ‘I hurt throughout the summer,’ admitted Giles, when looking back on his own sacking as Paul Downton’s new broom swept through English cricket. ‘It was painful and I was disappointed but I’m not bitter. I’ve got a job to do now.’ Giles has new career as cricket director and head coach at Lancashire . The job that Giles looked destined to do was become England coach in a carefully worked out succession programme that started with him taking over the one-day side to allow Flower more time to plan overall strategy. At the time, at the start of 2013, it seemed the perfect antidote to crazy schedules but it quickly became clear that two very different men with very different ideas would bring confusion rather than clarity. Test cricket has always been England’s priority and Giles was all too often forced to lead England in limited-overs cricket without important players who had been made to rest by the demands of the itinerary. Yet he still guided them to the brink of their first global 50-overs title when they reached the 2013 Champions Trophy final and was favourite to succeed Flower when he took the team to Bangladesh for the World Twenty20. Failure there, and in particular defeat by Holland, cemented the mood for change and Giles found himself on the outside without really being given a proper opportunity to stamp his identity and methods on the post. Giles has dusted himself down, picked himself up and embarked on the new challenge . ‘Was (Holland) the clincher for me? I don’t know,’ said Giles. ‘Momentum seemed to be moving towards Moores before then but it clearly didn’t help. It just about wrapped up all that happened to England in the previous six months which was horrible for all of us. It took some getting over.’ Giles will not criticise the two-man coaching system which saw him lead the limited-overs teams while still being answerable to Flower, but it is clear he felt his hands were tied when he discusses his preferred working methods. ‘What I enjoy is leading my own environment and putting my stamp on it,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I like to take decisions knowing that they are on my head and that I’m fully accountable for them. That’s the way I like to work.’ He is equally loath to comment on England’s continuing struggles in one-day cricket. Alastair Cook has now been axed for the World Cup in February and England will hope the likes of Moeen Ali and Alex Hales can get them off to a flyer Down Under. But Giles made an interesting observation on the perceived lack of dynamism when Cook was at the top of the batting order. ‘The most successful one-day sides don’t necessarily start their innings any quicker than us,’ said Giles. ‘But what they do so well is go through the gears during an innings. We’re still having trouble doing that.’ Giles was hurt by the England snub and required a summer of reflection to get over it . Giles will be able to make all the big decisions at Old Trafford as Lancashire’s cricket director and head coach after taking his time in deciding what was next for him. ‘I just didn’t care any more after the England thing,’ he admitted. ‘I needed a break after all that had happened and it was healthy for me to get away from it all. We went on a proper summer family holiday to the US, the first one I’ve had since the kids were born, and I did a bit of media work with ESPN. ‘There was also a charity climb and cricket match at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro which was one of the toughest things I’ve done but also one of the most rewarding. ‘I started to discover what I enjoy again but by the end of the summer I was desperate to get back in the game.’ He talked to Somerset but they plumped instead for Matthew Maynard, the former England Test batsman and ex-Glamorgan coach. ‘It’s great to see him back,’ said Giles. Then the chance came for him to join a Lancashire team who, with delicious irony, had been without a full-time coach since Moores left to take over England at the start of last season. Giles was often forced to lead England in limited-overs cricket without important players . ‘This is perfect for me and hopefully for Lancashire too,’ said Giles, as he looked out at his new ‘office’ of Old Trafford. ‘I have started working with the players and so far so good. We’re still unbeaten! ‘What strikes me is the size and history of this club. There are similarities with Warwickshire and I feel privileged to be able to lead another big county. Things are pretty healthy business-wise here now and we have a fantastic stadium. Cricket-wise it’s not too bad but there is work to do.’ Lancashire should belong in the first division competing for trophies but they have had an up-and-down time since Moores took them to that elusive Championship title three years ago. Promotion is clearly a priority for Giles but he does not want to indulge in a short-term fix. ‘The aim is to build something deep-rooted that stands the test of time and will be in place long after I’ve gone,’ said Giles. ‘We need stability, consistency and sustainability. It will take a few years to build that. The pressure will be on us to go straight back up but the most important thing is to put in place an underlying structure which will give us sustained success.’ England's shock defeat to Holland at World Twenty20 didn't help Giles' predicament . But is there the patience in modern sport, even the traditionally old-fashioned environment of county cricket, for a long-term plan? As Giles found to his cost with England, the demand for results is instant. ‘It’s a balancing act for sure,’ he said. ‘I want to provide a strong pathway to the Lancashire team through all the age groups and plan for tomorrow while looking after today. ‘The temptation is to look at who you can recruit but I want to try to improve the guys under our noses. It’s all very well changing things quickly but that usually doesn’t work and if we bring anyone in they will have to fit in with our values. ‘Social media has made for a society where everyone has a view and there’s a pressure to build very quickly. I hope to be given the time to do this properly. Look at Stuart Lancaster and the England rugby team. I think he’s doing an excellent job and putting something in place that could pay real dividends along the line. But people are asking questions of his results all the time. It takes time.’ Not that Giles wants to spend all his time coaching. Rather than think about a possible return to England in the future — managing director Downton said the job had come too soon for him when he appointed Moores — he has started to look at his long-term future. Peter Moores (left) was appointed coach following the departure of Andy Flower . Giles is completing a masters degree in sports directorship at Manchester Metropolitan University with a view to taking a wider control of a sporting team. ‘After I’d come round from the disappointment of England I realised I didn’t want to be caught in the coaching trap for ever,’ said Giles. ‘I don’t want to be hitting catches when I’m 50. This course is related to the business of sport and how the science works. It’s a good mix. It’s challenging but really enjoyable.’ So, instead of planning England’s attempt at finally making a mark at a World Cup, which appeared his destiny until he was rudely interrupted earlier this year, Giles has had plenty of other things on his plate. ‘If things were different I wouldn’t have climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, had a great holiday in America and undertaken a masters,’ added Giles. ‘And I wouldn’t be sitting here looking out over Manchester. I rather like it.’","Ashley Giles was casualty of the fallout from the Ashes disaster .

Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama and Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang make up the final contingent. A longer list involving 25 players was announced in November but that has now been whittled down. Yaya Toure has been revealed as one of three players nominated to win the African Player of the Year Award . Toure has won the award three times before, he scored 24 goals last season for City in all competitions . Toure, a three-time winner of the award, had an exceptional season as City won the Premier League in 2013-14, scoring 24 goals as Manuel Pellegrini brought home the title in his first season in England. He also played all three of the Ivory Coast's matches at the World Cup in Brazil. Aubameyang, meanwhile, scored 14 goals last season as Dortmund finished runners-up in the Bundesliga behind Bayern Munich. Enyeama helped guide Lille to a third-placed finish in Ligue 1 and also captained Nigeria at the World Cup in Brazil.

"Chelsea chiefs have met supporters in a bid to improve the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge, with proposals for designated singing sections and individuals to lead the songs. Jose Mourinho complained last month that it was like playing in ‘an empty stadium’ and, though he apologised, the issue is being taken seriously in the boardroom. After meeting supporters’ groups over the last month to canvass opinions, chairman Bruce Buck presented some of the ideas to the club’s fans’ forum in a meeting at the Bridge. Jose Mourinho said it was so quiet during the win over QPR that it was like playing at an empty stadium . Fans in the Matthew Harding Stand are acknowledged to be the rowdiest at Stamford Bridge . Stamford Bridge attracted a full house for the visit of  QPR, but Mourinho was unhappy with noise levels . Manchester United introduced a permanent singing section at Old Trafford in April 2014. It was brought about to improve the atmosphere, following trials in their matches against Real Sociedad (on October 23) and Fulham (on February 9). United's official website explained a singing section is designed to 'promote increased competition between the home and away fans'. Chelsea want to trial a new singing section in the Shed End, which is shared with away supporters, in the hope it will spark more noise from other parts of the ground. They also want to give individuals responsibility for leading the singing. The noisiest Chelsea fans are usually at the other end of the ground in the Matthew Harding Stand, and another idea is to move away fans and create a second large groundswell of vocal support in the Shed End. Away fans used to sit behind the dug-outs in the lower East Stand but Mourinho complained in his first spell at the club that they were too close to him and could easily influence the linesman and fourth official. Chelsea may even consider moving the dug-outs across the pitch if the away fans are moved back and the manager is unhappy. Such problems are by no means limited to Chelsea. Many grounds, including some famed for their passionate atmosphere, have been hit by the changing demographic of match-going fans in the Barclays Premier League era and the increasing corporate sector. Chelsea supporters teased their manager during the game immediately after his comments, chanting: ‘Jose, give us a song’. Chelsea fan groups were angered by Mourinho's comments, but the club appears to be taking action . Chelsea fans wave flags at Stamford Bridge on their way to a Europa League win over PSG .","Blues chiefs wish to introduce the proposals after Jose Mourinho claimed it was like playing in 'an empty stadium' last month .

"Russell Westbrook guides the Thunder to victory in San Antonio, the Heat spoil James' return to Miami and Los Angeles Clippers beat Golden State Warriors . LeBron James and Dwyane Wade wrapped each other in a pre-game embrace, chatted and laughed at half-time, then hugged again after the final buzzer. Just like old times. Only this time, just one got to enjoy a victory. James' return to Miami as an opponent was a success - for the Heat, that is. Wade scored 24 of his 31 points in the first half, Luol Deng had 25 points and dogged James defensively all night, and the Heat beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 101-91 in a hyped Christmas Day contest on Thursday. James also ended up in the crowd after overrunning for the ball in the second half, and he headed back to the locker room for a quick check up before returning to the court.

James pictured during the game with hands on hips as he got a mixed reaction before being cheered . Cleveland Cavaliers forward James hangs from the rim after a dunk during the second half of the NBA clash . 'We didn't have a bad breakup,' Wade said. 'We played against each other for seven years, man. The weirdness just wasn't there. It wasn't like we played against each other our whole career and the breakup happened. We played against each other for seven years, then with each other for a period of time, then he went back to the same situation and I'm in the same place.' Here's an example of how their relationship has endured: When James, who returned to Cleveland in the off-season after four seasons and two titles with the Heat, and the Cavaliers landed in South Florida on Wednesday, the four-time NBA MVP went to Wade's house for a night of Christmas Eve revelry. James turns 30 on Tuesday. He had questions for the 32-year-old Wade about what changes at that age. That's what they talked about, no smack about how the Cavaliers are perceived to be a championship contender and how the Heat aren't even at the .500 mark. James acknowledges his fans during the game, which ended in a 101-91 defeat for Cleveland Cavaliers . 'We only play this game for so long,' said James, who got a warm ovation when a video of his Heat highlights played in the first quarter. 'You've still got life afterwards. For us we're going to compete, we're going to go about our business and do what we need to do in our profession. You'll never let friendship come in between that.' It was fitting that they talked about life after 30 - because for the seventh time in their head-to-head meetings, both scored at least 30 points. James had 30 points and eight assists for the Cavaliers, who got 25 from Kyrie Irving and 14 from Kevin Love. 'Couple of the best in this generation,' Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said about the James vs. Wade nights. 'Spectacular. I wish I could sit back and enjoy it like a fan, because it's just fantastic basketball. ... However long these two guys play, you'll get your money's worth.' LeBron James warms up at the American Airlines Arena ahead of an emotional return to Miami . Miami Heat center Chris Andersen fouls Cleveland Cavaliers forward James . A close-up of James shoes during their Cleveland Cavaliers' NBA defeat against the Miami Heat . Deng had eight points and eight assists for Miami. Chris Andersen scored 12 for the Heat, who led by as many as 17, trailed for a moment in the fourth quarter before gathering themselves and pulling away again. Miami was again without Chris Bosh, still sidelined by a calf injury. Wade was just 2 for 12 after half-time. Backcourt mate Mario Chalmers was 2 for 12 for the game. It didn't matter. Miami found a way, even after a 17-point lead slipped away - just like a 23-pointer did against Philadelphia two nights earlier. An emotional return ended in defeat, but James said: 'I gave everything and more to this city when I was here' James had a go-ahead dunk in transition with 11:20 left. After that slam put Cleveland up 78-77, he got a technical foul for hanging on the rim a bit too long - so that lead lasted exactly zero seconds. Wade made a free throw after the technical, tying the game. And up 90-87 late, the Heat finished on an 11-4 spurt. 'We're not that good right now,' James said. 'We've won some really good games, we've lost some games, but we're not that good right now.'","LeBron James received a mixed welcome from Miami Heat fans .

"Arsene Wenger admits the figures do not bear scrutiny but he is certain that Arsenal have not slipped backwards during the last 12 months. Last Christmas, Wenger’s side were nicely poised in second place in the Barclays Premier League, with 36 points from 17 games and trailing leaders Liverpool only on goal difference. Yet, despite a summer outlay of more than £70million on Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck, Mathieu Debuchy, Calum Chambers and back-up goalkeeper David Ospina, they are nine points worse off than this time last season and 15 points adrift of leaders Chelsea. Arsene Wenger has insisted that his Arsenal team has not regressed in the last 12 months . Wenger said: ‘I don’t think that we have gone backwards in the quality of our squad because if you look at the five players that we bought, you cannot say that one of the five players is a failure. ‘I can’t deny that we are behind much more than last year because we had a depleted squad since the start of the season, and no stability, and the fact that we got so many important injuries at the back cost us too much. ‘We lost Debuchy and (Laurent) Koscielny at the same period for three months. It’s too much.’ From dreaming of winning their first title since the Invincibles campaign of 2003-04, Arsenal are preparing for another anxious fight to extend their proud Champions League record to 18 consecutive years. However, the manager, having broken a nine-year trophy drought by winning the FA Cup last season, is not prepared to give up on the Premier League title just yet. Martin Skrtel heads in Liverpool's dramatic late equaliser in the Premier League clash at Anfield . Wenger highlighted the recent additions to his squad such as former Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez . Wenger said: ‘Let’s see how the schedule goes over Christmas. We will have a much better idea at the beginning of January. It can still change. The next three or four games are important. ‘Chelsea will be in the fight for the title, for sure. Will it only be Chelsea and Manchester City? Today you can say maybe, but it is still a long way. Chelsea play Champions League, Man City do as well. Then you have the FA Cup and Chelsea also play in the League Cup. There is still a long way to go. ‘What is for sure is that teams like us, and those around us, need to be massively consistent to have a chance to come back. At the moment, it’s better if I don’t talk too much and we perform on the pitch.’ Injury problems linger. Still, he is without half a dozen first-team regulars going into the game at home to Queen’s Park Rangers but all except Jack Wilshere are expected back before the end of January. The Arsenal boss also attributes some of his problems to the World Cup, which he believes has influenced players physically and mentally. The Gunners boss has received heavy criticism from some sections of the club's supporters . Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is again out with an ankle injury after a heavy challenge from Paddy McNair . ‘After the World Cup, we had too many players who were not at their level,’ said Wenger. ‘Too many came back not ready to compete again. Then you look again at the number of players we lost when they were just back to their best. ‘We had no Walcott, no Wilshere, no Ozil, no Debuchy, no Koscielny, no Arteta for too long periods. No Giroud for three months. It’s like you have half of the squad out!’ Wenger still believes the best way to address these problems of fatigue is to introduce a mid- season break to relieve the relentless grind of English football, although he would like to see it in the new year to protect the traditional festive fixtures. ‘Maybe it would be good for the English national team to have a break,’ he said. ‘Respect the English tradition, and have a break in January. If you look at the history, is it a coincidence the German team have always done well in big tournaments when England haven’t done so well? Germany has the longest winter break in Europe, out of the big countries. And by coincidence, they always do well in tournaments because they have refreshed players.’ Wenger said his team had badly missed players such as Mathieu Debuchy while they were injured . The idea of a winter break in England has been debated often. Sven Goran Eriksson pushed hard for it when he ran the national team, but was unsuccessful. It always hits the same obstacles. The Premier League will not vote to reduce the number of teams in the top flight and in turn the Football League and the Football Association are reluctant to surrender FA Cup replays and one leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final to generate necessary space in a congested calendar where midweek dates are dominated by UEFA competitions. Any agreement is still hard to imagine, not least because many fear clubs would abuse a break and see it as merely another chance to squeeze in a commercial tour, disguised as warm-weather training, but managers will often back the principle. ‘You don’t go on tour, but you give them two weeks off and then you prepare like the German teams do,’ said Wenger. ‘They stopped on Saturday and they come back at the beginning of January.’","Arsenal drew 2-2 with Liverpool in their last Premier League match .

"Queens Park Rangers have been given a major fillip after key midfielder Sandro returned to training. The Brazilian has been out since November 22 after sustaining a knee injury in the defeat at Newcastle. But the former Tottenham midfielder has returned to the club’s Harlington HQ as he steps up his rehab. He plans to resume full training early next month ahead of a first-team comeback towards the end of January. However, Rangers boss Harry Redknapp has learned that left back Yun Suk-young will miss up to six weeks with an ankle injury. Sandro (right) has made a return to training following a lay-off of over a month . But Yun Suk-young is on the sidelines for up to six weeks after suffering an ankle injury . The defender damaged ankle ligaments in last Saturday’s 3-2 win over West Bromwich Albion. Redknapp admits he is in the market for a new left back next month, but says QPR’s finances mean the club must rely on the loan market. ‘The injury to Yun means left back is an area we might look at,’ said the QPR manager. ‘But the club doesn’t want to get into trouble by spending money we don’t have. We have what we have so we’ll try to take a couple of loans.’ Meanwhile, Redknapp has backed Arsenal to qualify for next season’s Champions League, but only because their competitors have not been up to scratch. Charlie Austin has netted 11 Premier League goals and his fitness is key to the Hoops' chances of survival . Rangers travel to the Emirates Stadium  looking for a second successive victory. And despite Arsenal’s difficulties this season, Redknapp says they will secure a top-four spot. ‘I think the other sides have not performed to their normal level,’ said the Rangers boss. ‘Tottenham are starting to pick up some points but Everton and Liverpool, who were bang there last year, this year they are not and they need to start getting it together quickly. ‘And I’m not writing West Ham off either, but I still think Arsenal and Manchester United will fill the other two spots.’","Sandro has been out after injuring his knee at Newcastle on November 22 .

"There's a charming town in southern France, roughly 600 miles from Manchester and 400 from Madrid, where an Irish woman is living in a different kind of world to Robin van Persie and James Rodriguez. It’s here, in Albi, where Stephanie Roche calls home these days. Or at least for the next six months, if things go well. She’s taking a big step in this small town, moving to professional football from the Irish amateur game, where she scored the goal that lapped the planet. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Stephanie Roche's stunning goal for Peamount United . Peamount United forward Stephanie Roche flicks the ball away from the defender and up into the air . Roche waits for the ball to drop before volleying it, as the defender tries in vain to stop her . The 25-year-old's effort flies into the top corner of the net, leaving the Wexford keeper with no chance . Since here wonder goal, Roche has moved on to play professionally for French club ASPTT Albi . She speaks no French and all bar two of her team-mates speak no English; when the 25-year-old returns to her small apartment each night, it’s alone, away from her footballer boyfriend and family in Ireland. But her dream for years has been to get to this level, playing full-time football in a respected league. James Rodriguez, Robin van Persie and Aaron Ramsey all make the cut as Sportsmail selects their top 10 best goals of 2014 . Only the best players in the French top flight can expect to earn as much as £800 a month, but for Roche, ‘it’s about loving the game, not being rich’. In that sense, the romance has never been less one-sided. There have been almost five million YouTube hits for her goal, though Roche is more interested in the countdown to January 12, when the Puskas Award will be presented in Zurich. There, at the Ballon d’Or gala, she will learn if the public voted her goal the world’s best in 2013-14, ahead of Colombia’s Rodriguez and Robin van Persie of Holland. Van Persie is her favourite player and Manchester United happen to be her favourite club. ‘I might well ask for a picture or two,’ she says. ‘I probably won’t ask for an autograph because I don’t want to look out of place.’ Stephanie Roche is all smiles as she is interviewed by Sportsmail in her new home, Albi . Roche says 'it's about loving the game, not being rich' as she adapts to the change of scenery in France . Roche says she will be the happiest footballer in the world if she wins the goal of the year award for 2013-14 . That much should not be in doubt — the quality of her goal puts her there on merit. But the goal’s circumstances, with 85 people and one camcorder in attendance, means she stands out to say the least. ‘Van Persie and Rodriguez scored in the World Cup, so I guess mine is a little different,’ Roche says. ‘I don’t want to sound cheeky but I think mine was the best of the three.' And what a remarkable goal it was. The 25-second clip from October 2013 — the span for entries was October 2013 to September 2014 — is a little fuzzy. It was uploaded to YouTube by the manager of Peamount United, Eileen Gleeson, whose side were playing Wexford Youth in the Women’s National League. There isn’t a supporter to be seen as Peamount’s Aine O’Gorman crosses from the right to Roche. The Republic of Ireland international controls with her right, uses her left to lob her marker and then spins to volley the dropping ball from the edge of the box. From cross to net, the ball doesn’t touch the ground. James Rodriguez fires Colombia into a 1-0 lead against Uruguay during the 2014 World Cup .

Van Persie's header pulled Holland level and sent his team on their way to a 5-1 victory . Ian Wright described it as the best he has seen, David Luiz called it ‘incredible’ and Gary Lineker said it was the goal of the season. Roche’s first thoughts were less grand. ‘I’m a forward so I was just thinking that it was my first of the season,’ she says. ‘Then after the game the Wexford manager called me over to watch it on his laptop. ‘I thought, “OK, that’s actually quite nice”. It’s lucky it was caught on tape. You don’t get cameras there every week.’ Gleeson put the video on YouTube and for a time it never spread beyond friends and family. Then things got a little intense. ‘After about a week it wasn’t noticed,’ Roche says. ‘Then it went on a football website in Ireland, a few people shared it and then I had a tweet one morning from Soccer AM on Sky. It said #unbelievabletekkers so I got in front of the TV and 20 minutes later they are showing my goal. Now it has had millions of views. ‘I realised how big it was when people like Ian Wright, Matt Le Tissier and David Luiz were talking about it. Dara O’Briain, the comedian, as well.

'John Hartson went through it on TV and was really positive about my technique. ‘I’ve been asked about the goal by shows in the US, Germany, Belgium, France, Brazil, Egypt. Honestly, it’s all gone crazy.’ After the incredible surge of popularity, it was announced earlier this month that she was on the shortlist with Rodriguez and Van Persie, making her the first female player to ever reach the final three. ‘Some rubbish gets talked about women’s football so it’s been very nice that it might help change opinions,’ Roche says. ‘But the whole thing has been so much fun. To be up against Van Persie is great. My boyfriend and I go to watch United seven or eight times a year. ‘Funnily enough, my boyfriend (Dean Zambra) plays in the League of Ireland for Bray Wanderers and he was up for goal of the season there. He was saying, “How is your goal up for the Puskas and mine wasn’t?” It’s all been so much fun.’ Jonjo Shelvey chested down a Brad Guzan clearance before volleying home from 50-yards . Villa goalkeeper Guzan had no chance of saving Shelvey's strike at the Liberty Stadium in April . Blaise Matuidi connects with his unique version of a bicycle kick during a friendly against Holland . Certainly it’s made the adaptation to life in France easier. Roche moved over to join ASPTT Albi on a one-year contract in June, before she was shortlisted. Crowds are between 500 and 1,000 a game and training is five days a week rather than the two days she’d do at Peamount. When Sportsmail visits she is twice recognised by strangers on the street. But for all her new fame and joy at full-time football, it’s not a living as Van Persie or Rodriguez would know it. ‘It’s hard out here with the language and I don’t make a lot of money,’ Roche says. ‘I am looked after with my apartment and bills but what I earn is what I live off. 'I’ll have to make a life for myself at some point but this is about the football. ‘I wanted to test myself, to give it a go. It is what I wanted so I have no complaints about it being hard. None at all — I’m happy. This nomination makes me happier still. ‘If I actually win the thing I’ll be the happiest footballer in the world.’ To vote in the Puskas Award, visit: www.fifa.com/ballon-dor/puskas-award .","Stephanie Roche has been shortlisted for the FIFA goal of the year award alongside James Rodriguez and Robin van Persie .

"Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has praised Harry Kane for emerging from a difficult loan spell with Leicester to lead the line for Tottenham, but believes it is too soon for an England call-up just yet. Kane spent four months at the King Power Stadium in 2013, but only played in three wins and mostly featured from the bench, scoring twice in 15 games. Leicester suffered a late-season slump and only squeezed into the Championship playoffs with a last-minute winner on the final day before losing out to Watford in the semi-finals in dramatic circumstances. Nigel Pearson has praised Tottenham's young striker Harry Kane ahead of their Boxing Day meeting . Pearson is impressed with how Kane, 21, has responded in his career — with 13 goals in 22 games for Spurs this season. ‘Harry came in at a difficult time for us and I think for him,’ said the Leicester manager. ‘We were in a terrible run then just as we are now. So it wasn’t always easy for him, but he handled himself exceptionally well. ‘Of course, he’s a couple of years older now, with more experience — and as a very likeable and level-headed young man, as he was then, he’s proved to be an outstanding talent. ‘People are even talking about the possibility of an international call-up. But again, let’s keep things in perspective. He’s doing very well for himself and for his club at the moment. ‘I’d like to think he’d look back on his time here as valuable, whether in terms of the appearances he made or of being able to deal with setbacks in football. But Pearson feels the in-form forward is not quite ready for an international call-up . Kane has scored a remarkable 13 goals since coming into the Tottenham side this season . ‘In hindsight you learn as much from the difficult times as you do from the positive. Harry was very popular and the staff rated him highly.’ Meanwhile, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has warned Emmanuel Adebayor that it will take more than a crowded festive fixture list to grant a return to the team. Adebayor scored 14 last season but has only struck twice since Pochettino replaced Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane in the summer and has not started a game for almost two months. ‘I will decide to pick him when he’s ready,’ said the Spurs boss. ‘When he deserves to play, he plays.’ Pochettino has made it clear reputations count for nothing under his leadership. Paulinho and Aaron Lennon are others who have been on the fringes while academy graduates Kane, Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason have thrived. Mauricio Pochettino has warned Emmanuel Adebayor he will only regain his place in the side if he deserves it . Kane seized his chance while Adebayor struggled with injuries and returned to Africa for personal reasons. ‘Football pays when you work hard,’ said Pochettino, on the subject of 21-year-old Kane. ‘We need to take advantage of the player’s moment.’ Adebayor, 30, was not included in the squad who beat Burnley on Saturday. Asked if he would need to bring the Togo striker back for the Christmas programme, with three games in seven days, starting at Leicester, Pochettino shrugged and said: ‘Maybe, maybe.’","Leicester City host Tottenham on Boxing Day in the Premier League .

"One of Louis van Gaal’s predecessors at Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson, turned the haranguing of referees into something of an art form. Van Gaal’s Boxing Day opponent at Old Trafford, Newcastle’s Alan Pardew, has also been known to overstep the mark in his technical area in every sense. But as much as he commands an automatic place in the spotlight, Van Gaal has been happy to spend his first five months in English football sat largely in the shadows. Louis van Gaal (third left) has opted for a measured approach on the bench since taking over at United . Van Gaal observes proceedings as Manchester United suffer a surprise loss at the hands of lowly Leicester . The Dutchman has opted not to react furiously while on the sidelines, unlike Sir Alex Ferguson . The Dutchman has been conspicuous by his absence on the touchline, preferring to stay in his dug-out during games studiously taking notes. Not for him the antics of Ferguson, who spoke once again this week about the benefits of pointing animatedly to his watch in front of match officials to give United a little extra ‘Fergie Time’ when required. Van Gaal questions the myth. ‘You think the referee is looking at Ferguson?’ he said. ‘On television you can see that because every television station is recording the manager, I know. But the referee is not looking at the TV. Maybe after the match, but then he can’t change anything any more. ‘I don’t think I can influence the referee, no. When I was in my first year I did everything. But I learned to be more quiet. I write notes for half-time. I can say the things that I am willing to say that can influence the match. Then the sequence is always the right way because the players remember the moments of the game in sequence. It’s more efficient then.’ Ferguson clashed with Pardew when United last met Newcastle in a Boxing Day fixture at home two years ago, a memorable game that ended 4-3 after the United boss pursued referee Mike Dean on to the pitch at half-time. Sir Alex was later criticised by Pardew and responded with his famous ‘wee club in the North East’ putdown. The Newcastle boss is no stranger to touchline controversy. In the past year alone, Pardew has been banned for seven games and fined a total of £160,000 for butting Hull midfielder David Meyler, and warned about his conduct after calling Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini a ‘f****** old ****’. Sir Alex Ferguson's touchline explosions were a familiar sight during his all-conquering reign at United . Ferguson looks aghast in the Old Trafford dugout during defeat to Liverpool in 2004 . Ferguson and Pardew fell out on Boxing Day 2012 following a spat on the sidelines . Pardew was banned for seven games following this headbutt on Hull's David Meyler . In 2012 he was suspended for two matches and fined £20,000 for pushing an assistant referee in a row over a throw-in, having previously been involved in angry altercations with Arsene Wenger and Martin O’Neill. Van Gaal does not see the point in ranting and raving on the touchline. ‘I have never had a fight,’ he said. ‘I only use my voice, never my hands or something like that.’ So why do other managers scream at their players, officials and rival managers? ‘You have to ask them,’ he replied. ‘I don’t have the idea that you can influence a game by shouting from the sidelines. ‘With the fans in the Premier League shouting so much, the players can’t understand you. That’s why I’m always on the bench. You have trained them to read the game by themselves. It is much more important that they are more involved with the game, that they make their own decisions. It is like a child, you educate. ‘Sometimes they can’t read that but then you have half-time or you have a (substitution). Then you can say to the player who is coming on to the pitch how they have to play in their position. You have to transfer that.’ United’s draw at Aston Villa last weekend ended a run of six straight wins in the Premier League, and Van Gaal’s side are now 10 points adrift of leaders Chelsea. Christian Benteke put Aston Villa ahead but the game ended 1-1 to end United's winning streak . Jose Mourinho has lifted titles throughout Europe on all seven occasions his teams have topped the table at Christmas, but Van Gaal has not given up hope of turning United into champions in his first season in English football. He added: ‘In the Netherlands and also in Germany you have the Christmas champions but that doesn’t count at the end of May or June — then you have to be first. ‘It’s better to be the Christmas champions, then the possibility you shall be next champion is bigger — but not certain. Our goal is still to be champions at the end of the season. We are looking in a football world where No 1 is the most important thing. Our goal is to be first.’ Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand has backed his former club to finish in the top three this season after overcoming a ‘sticky start’ under Van Gaal. Ferdinand, whose 12-year stint at Old Trafford ended in the summer, is convinced his old side’s recent revival will continue. ‘Six weeks ago you’d be thinking hopefully they’d get in the Champions League,’ Ferdinand said. ‘Looking at them now, they’ll finish in third place, definite Champions League, then maybe they’ll get one of the cups. Rio Ferdinand warned Manchester United's title rivals to expect a fight come the business end of the season . ‘If they continue on the run they’re on, who knows? They could go into second or first, but Champions League this season would have been something they were asking for. ‘Van Gaal had a sticky start, but the lads seem to be getting a better understanding of what he wants and you can see that in the results in the last six games. Michael Carrick coming back has been a huge plus for them.’ Ferdinand also spoke of the change in his relationship with Ferguson. ‘It’s crazy. You listen to him speak now — he created that divide between himself and the players, but now I’ve spoken to him more than when I played at United. He seems like he’s really enjoying life and I’m sure he’s enjoying Christmas with the family.’","Ferguson was well-known for his outbursts on the sidelines .

"NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens  will warn today that Britain needs to 'get back in shape' if a public health catastrophe is to be avoided . Britain needs to ‘get back in shape’ if a public health catastrophe is to be avoided, the head of the NHS warns today. Simon Stevens is to launch a national anti-obesity drive in the new year – as a report finds Britain is now the second fattest country in Europe. In a clarion call to those recovering from the excesses of Christmas Day, Mr Stevens will ask GPs to identify tens of thousands of fat patients to be put on anti-diabetes programmes and offered lifestyle advice. The NHS England chief executive will say that losing just 5 to 7 per cent of weight can cut the chance of developing diabetes by almost 60 per cent, according to research. The warning comes as a study of 30 European nations found that only Hungary has fatter adults than Britain. Campaigners said Britain needs to make a collective New Year’s resolution to reverse current trends, which suggest two thirds of middle-aged men will be obese in two decades, official data shows. Mr Stevens also attacked a ‘daft’ European Court of Justice ruling last week which said obesity should be counted as a disability. He said such fatalistic talk should be abandoned in favour of a realisation that it was up to all of us to take responsibility for our health and get in shape. ‘The ghost of Christmases past reminds us that 20 years ago we didn’t have these problems as a nation,’ Mr Stevens said. ‘The ghost of Christmases future tells us that if we get our act together – as the NHS, as parents, as schools, the food industry – we can get back in shape. Scroll down for video . ‘Rather than recent daft judgments by the European Court practically pretending that obesity is inevitable, in England in 2015 we’re going to start proving that it isn’t. ‘That’s why the NHS is going to be funding a new national programme, proven to work, that will offer tens of thousands of people at risk of diabetes proper support to get healthier, eat better and exercise more.’ Under the new scheme, GPs will be asked to identify patients at risk of diabetes – especially those under 40 who are overweight. After tests for pre-diabetes, they will be advised on fitness and diet . The extent of Britain’s obesity epidemic was exposed in the latest study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Its Health At A Glance Europe 2014 report shows 24.7 per cent of British adults are obese, compared with a European average of 16.7 per cent. Norway, Switzerland, Italy, Bulgaria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria and Romania all have obesity levels of less than 13 per cent. Only Hungary has higher rates of adult obesity than the UK, at 28.5 per cent. The OECD report, based on data collected in 2012, shows Britain’s rate rose from 23 per cent in 2002. Rankings cannot be compared, as some countries in the 2014 report did not feature in 2002. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index of 30 or more, meaning the person’s weight is a danger to their health. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres. A measure of between 18.5 and 25 is healthy. Independent research earlier this year found that obesity costs British taxpayers more than the police, prisons and fire service combined. Mr Stevens believes anti-obesity schemes will begin saving the NHS money within three years. Under the scheme, GPs will be asked to identify patients at risk of diabetes – especially those under 40 who are overweight. After tests for pre-diabetes, they will be advised on fitness and diet, followed by regular monitoring. Earlier this year, a major study suggested a third of Britons have borderline diabetes. The NHS spends £10billion a year treating the three million sufferers of the condition – the majority of whom have type two, linked to obesity. Local NHS organisations that have run successful diabetes prevention schemes will be asked to help design the national programme. Official data suggests that if obesity was reduced from the current rate of almost 25 per cent to the 1993 level of 15 per cent, about five million cases of disease could be prevented in two decades. The National Obesity Forum’s Tam Fry said: ‘After all the food and drink consumed yesterday and today, I wouldn’t be surprised if the UK had caught up with Hungary … The National Obesity Forum is calling for a national New Year’s resolution … to tackle the aftermath of turkey, pud and cake.’ Obesity has caused 88,000 avoidable cancer cases, according to Cancer Research UK . Four in ten cancers could have been prevented over the past five years if Britons had adopted healthier lifestyles, research shows. A toll of 600,000 avoidable cases includes 314,000 caused by smoking, 145,000 by poor diet – including eating too much red meat – and 88,000 from obesity, says Cancer Research UK. Figures from the charity show that around 40 per cent of the 331,500 new cases diagnosed each year are directly caused by a poor lifestyle. According to the statistics, half of us will be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetime. Scientists are urging the public to make simple lifestyle changes to slash the odds. Researchers from Queen Mary, University of London – funded by Cancer Research UK – looked at more than 100 existing studies to calculate how many cancers diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 were caused by poor lifestyle. In addition to smoking, a poor diet and obesity, they found that a further 62,200 cases were down to excess alcohol and 55,900 from spending too much time in the sun. Professor Max Parkin, a Cancer Research UK statistician, said: ‘There’s now little doubt that certain lifestyle choices can have a big impact on cancer risk, with research around the world all pointing to the same key risk factors.’ But he added that ‘we can stack the odds in our favour by taking positive steps now that will help decrease our cancer risk in future’.","Simon Stevens will launch national anti-obesity drive in the new year .

"After a month of threats from hackers that nearly derailed its release and almost brought Sony Pictures to its knees, the long-awaiting opening of The Interview on Christmas Day became a major event with packed crowds flocking to not only see the movie but also champion freedom of expression. Hundreds of theaters, from The Edge 8 in Greenville, Alabama, to Michael Moore's Bijou by the Bay in Traverse City, Michigan,  made special holiday arrangements for the Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Sony Pictures had initially called off the release after major theater chains dropped the movie that was to have opened on as many as 3,000 screens. But with President Obama among others criticizing the decision, Sony officials changed their minds and independent theaters agreed to release it in over 300 venues on Christmas Day. Scroll down for video . Patrons wait in line to see The Interview at the Valley Art theater in Tempe, Arizona on Christmas Day after the Sony release was reinstated in some independent theaters and through a variety of digital platforms . Theater goers in Austin, Texas, enjoyed a sing along of Proud To be An American ahead of a Christmas Day screening of The Interview at the Alamo Drafthouse . People wait in line on Christmas day to watch the first screening of the controversial movie The Interview at the Plaza Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia . A movie goer heads to her seat at West End Cinema, one of just a few theaters showing The Interview  in Washington, DC . 'We are taking a stand for freedom,' said theater manager Lee Peterson of the Cinema Village East in Manhattan, where most of Thursday's seven screenings had sold out by early afternoon. 'We want to show the world that Americans will not be told what we can or cannot watch. Personally, I am not afraid.' 'It was more serious, the satire, than I was expecting,' said Simone Reynolds, who saw the film while visiting from London. 'There's a message for America in there too about America's foreign policy.' Ken Jacowitz, a 54-year-old librarian from the New York borough of Queens, called it 'a funny film made by funny people.' He had a message for North Korea and the hackers: 'You have given this movie whole new lives.' At Atlanta's Plaza Theater, a sell-out crowd on Thursday hailed the film's release, washing down popcorn with beer and cocktails and uniting for a boisterous sing-along of God Bless America before the opening credits. 'This is way more fun than it would have been,' said Jim Kelley of Atlanta, who waited outside with his daughter, Shannon. The elder Kelley added, with mocking sarcasm, 'This is almost dangerous, like we're living life on the edge.' In Little Rock, members of an Arkansas family who say they otherwise would have never seen The Interview were among the first patrons at the Riverdale 10 theater. Kay Trice and her husband drove an hour from Stuttgart, Arkansas, to see the movie with their daughter and appreciated 'the freedom to see it.' 'It should be shown in this country and somebody in North Korea should not have the right to scare us out of seeing this,' Trice said. Moviegoers wait for The Interview to begin at the Chase Park Plaza Cinema  in St. Louis. Sony Pictures had initially called off the release after major theater chains dropped the movie that was to have opened on as many as 3,000 screens .

Barbara Magrino, 69, waits to pickup her tickets for a screening of The Interview at the Valley Art theater in Tempe, Arizona. Tickets for all five showings on Thursday were sold out . For many patrons attending screenings of The Interview going to see the film was as much about championing freedom of expression as it was about going to the movies on Christmas Day . Security was light at many theaters, with the occasional police officer on hand. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying that there were no credible threats . Co-directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, who also co-stars in the low-brow comedy with James Franco, surprised moviegoers by appearing at the sold-out 12:30 a.m. PT (0330 ET) screening of the movie at a theater in Los Angeles, where they briefly thanked fans for their support. A few dozen people lined up early outside Tempe, Arizona's Valley Art theater, where tickets for all five showings on Thursday had sold out. 'There are a lot of people going crazy over (the controversy). It's bigger than the movie,' said Omar Khiel, 20. At the Cinema Village theater in Manhattan, the 10 a.m. screening was near capacity. Derek Karpel, a 34-year-old attorney, said that 'as many people as possible should go see it. In fact, the government should subsidize tickets to make that possible.' But he wasn't about to call The Interview a national treasure. 'No one should go into expecting it to be a serious commentary on politics,' he said. 'But it's fun. People should go.' The Interview also made history by becoming made available on a variety of digital platforms on Wednesday afternoon, including Google Play, YouTube Movies, Microsoft's Xbox Video and a separate Sony website. A Sony spokeswoman on Thursday said she had no figures on the number of downloads so far, and the studio was not expected to have box office numbers from theaters before Friday morning.

'The Interview,' the comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, was listed under an American flag on the marquee of the Cinefamily at Silent Movie Theater in Los Angeles . The back story of The Interview has itself played out like a Hollywood satire, in which a cartoonish farce distracts from some of the holiday season's most prestigious films: Selma, the drama about the 1965 civil rights march; Angelina Jolie's adaptation of the best-selling World War II story Unbroken; and the all-star, big-screen version of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods. Security was light at many theaters, with the occasional police officer on hand. The possibility of violence was taken more seriously by the movie industry than by government officials. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying that there were no credible threats. Meanwhile, Darrell Foxworth, a special agent for the FBI in San Diego, said on Wednesday the agency was sharing information with independent movie theater owners showing The Interview out of 'an abundance of caution' and to educate them about cyber threats and what help the FBI can offer. Kim Song, a North Korean diplomat to the United Nations, condemned the release on Wednesday, calling the movie an 'unpardonable mockery of our sovereignty and dignity of our supreme leader.' But Kim said North Korea will likely limit its response to condemnation, with no 'physical reaction.' Decisions to show the movie through the internet could open up companies to hacking. Xbox and PlayStation's online gaming services were down on Thursday afternoon but the cause was unclear. A hacking group called the Lizard Squad claimed it was behind disruptions at both Xbox and Sony Corp's PlayStation Networks, which was not carrying 'The Interview.' Neither Microsoft nor Sony offered explanations for the connectivity problems, though both services expected heavy use as consumers who received the devices for Christmas tried to log on all at once. Extra network traffic on Xbox from users downloading The Interview may also have exacerbated connectivity problems for Microsoft. Meanwhile, YouTube and other Google products were not having any disruptions.

"The easy thing to do would have been to let someone else step up. With time ticking by and a game slipping away, Adam Lallana knew exactly what was at stake when Liverpool won a corner. This was their last chance to salvage a point against Arsenal and the wrong delivery would have been greeted with a mix of derision and exasperation by the Kop. Those without sufficient mental strength would have been inclined to pass on such responsibility. Adam Lallana's corner is headed home by Martin Skrtel as Liverpool rescued a point against Arsenal . Lallana has been under pressure since his big-money move to Liverpool this summer from Southampton . Lallana, however, did not flinch. He ended up delivering the perfect set-piece, inviting Martin Skrtel to thunder in a header and secure a 2-2 draw. If the centre back’s goal on Sunday has the potential to change Liverpool’s season, the assist could be vital for the man who provided it. Things have not been straight-forward for Lallana since his £23.7million summer switch from Southampton. He has sat out big games, nursed injuries and struggled for form but his persistence and determination cannot be questioned. The evidence was there for all to see last Sunday when it mattered. ‘When you’re not playing well and results aren’t going well, it’s easy to hide and not want the ball,’ said Lallana. ‘But that’s where you have to work through because eventually it will click. Something good will happen, you will gain confidence and you’ll have a good impact.’ Skrtel celebrates with Lallana as the stoppage-time goal provided Liverpool with some momentum . Having beaten Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup, Liverpool are trying to put together a string of results . Lallana celebrates with Raheem Sterling after the winger scored against Bournemouth last week . Few would dispute that Lallana, who has been playing with broken ribs, would benefit from a change of fortune; they would also find it difficult to argue with the fact he has looked a different player since Brendan Rodgers reverted to a 3-4-3 formation and let Liverpool attack once more. There have been signs over the past fortnight that, perhaps, Liverpool are about to leave behind the form that made their autumn so wretched. The atmosphere at Anfield was certainly lifted by the manner in which they attacked Arsenal from the start. A shortage of confidence, undoubtedly, had been an issue for Liverpool’s players — not just Lallana — but they now have a prime opportunity to start building momentum, given their festive fixture list begins on Boxing Day against Burnley at Turf Moor and includes home dates with Swansea and Leicester. ‘I think we’re getting a bit of confidence and rhythm in our game,’ said the 26-year-old, who celebrated his first wedding anniversary on Christmas Eve. The England midfielder celebrates his first Liverpool goal, against West Brom in October . It has been a difficult start to life at Anfield for Lallana, but he is beginning to show why he cost so much . ‘We’re causing teams problems, so we can gain belief from that. The lads were lacking a bit of confidence. ‘That comes with disappointing results. Anyone in the game will tell you that you have these points in your career when you have got to show a bit of bottle, where you’ve got to go looking for the ball. We’ve had that and it’s about keeping on going into work, wanting to come back strong. ‘There’s been a lot of talk in-house that we have to stick together as a squad. When you’re not playing well, everyone will be up against you, wanting you to slip up. So it has been about us sticking together. We know we have character and a great dressing room.’ What Lallana says also works in Liverpool’s favour is the presence of Rodgers, the manager who was so desperate to sign him. Liverpool’s group may have been stung by criticism but Rodgers has ensured they have not lost focus. Brendan Rodgers has been criticised after his side's slow start to the season following last year's success . Lallana insists his manager has been fantastic and believes Liverpool can still have a good season . ‘He’s been fantastic with me and the group as a whole,’ Lallana explained. ‘I’m sure he’s found it difficult as well. You cannot always ignore what people write and say. But it’s about sticking together and that’s what he’s mentioned — we stick together no matter how many people have their opinions. ‘There are reasons (Liverpool are not fighting for the title like last year) and people might not like the reasons but it’s up to us, step by step, to gradually get back to where the lads were last year. Over the last couple of games I think we have found a system to suit and that’s credit to the manager.’ In Rodgers' new 3-4-3 formation Lallana is starting to rediscover his superb form from Southampton . Will 3-4-3 be the key to Liverpool staging a revival in the new year? Lallana will not make any bold declarations but he is quick to point out that the season, come May, might yet be judged as a triumph, given the avenues that are open. ‘We’re in the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup (against Chelsea) — I can’t wait for that,’ said Lallana. ‘We’ve also got a good run of games coming up in the league, where, if we put in performances like we did against Arsenal, we’ll have a strong chance of picking up points.’","Adam Lallana has struggled since £23.7million to Liverpool .

"Mario Balotelli's hopes of transforming his Liverpool career have suffered another blow after Brendan Rodgers warned he must get used to being a substitute. The Italy striker is available for the game at Burnley after serving a one-match suspension but Liverpool’s manager has no intentions of handing Balotelli an immediate recall. Liverpool’s performances have improved recently since Rodgers reverted to a 3-4-3 formation and the manager says Balotelli does not have the traits to play that role.

Mid-table Liverpool head to Turf Moor knowing that only a victory will suffice as they hope for a top four spot . It is the latest sign that Balotelli’s career at Anfield is doomed to failure and Rodgers would not provide any assurances to the 24-year-old that he will be starting any time soon. When asked how Balotelli would deal with being a substitute, Rodgers said: ‘It’s something he would have to. If the team is going to need him from the bench, then it’s something he would have to become adjusted to. ‘It’s the same for every single player, not just him. When called upon — whether it’s to start a game or come off the bench — you ask your players to be ready.’ Balotelli has not scored in the Barclays Premier League since joining Liverpool in a £16million deal in August and, due to a combination of injuries and suspension, he has only played 124 minutes since November 8. His manager feels he does not have the attributes to thrive in the style Liverpool play. Balotelli was last seen in a Liverpool shirt as a substitute  during the 3-0 mauling at Old Trafford . Brendan Rodgers (right) must pick up the mercurial Italian in order to resurrect his short Liverpool career . Rodgers  added: ‘We have seen it’s not really his game (to press defenders and run). Working with him for the period of time he’s been here, we have seen that he’s probably someone who’s better in and around the box. ‘So that level of intensity and pressing isn’t part of his game. But you try to get the best out of the players you have and the qualities they have. ‘That’s something we will focus on. The most important thing is that he is now available and adds another player to this squad.’","Balotelli is available to play at Burnley after a one-match suspension .

"With a triumphant smile, cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson shows how she can now stand on her own – thanks to Daily Mail readers. The two-year-old was unable to walk but has strengthened her legs using a special bicycle and has progressed to take steps. Readers raised £55,000 for Sophie after she was denied NHS funding for surgery to help her walk at the same trust which paid for aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham's breast enlargement operation. Scroll down for video . Proud smile: Sophie Thomlinson is now able to stand on her own thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers . Readers' funds enabled Sophie's family to buy the specially-adapted £1,200 bicycle to strengthen her legs ahead of the procedure, which they hope she will have in the US when she turns three next year. While Sophie posed for pictures for the Mail, she suddenly stood up without help for the first time – causing her mother to burst into tears. 'I couldn't believe that she just did it,' said her mother Allison, 41, who is a nurse. 'It shows how well she's coming on.' Sophie will still need the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to be able to walk freely. She was born prematurely with spastic diplegia – a form of cerebral palsy. Her mother said: 'We are just so pleased Sophie has been able to take a step. It has all stemmed from the bike. She's on it all the time and the more she's on it the more strength she's getting. 'That is good news for the operation because the stronger she is the better. Without the donations from readers we would never have been able to afford the bike so I can't say how grateful we are.'

"ITV came under fire from viewers today for screening an 'offensive' e-cigarette advert during I'm A Celebrity which appeared to show a woman talking about oral sex. A woman in a black cocktail dress uttered a series of suggestive phrases in the 20-second commercial screened just after the watershed. Advertising watchdogs have launched a full investigation into the advert after receiving a 'significant number' of complaints. Scroll down for video . 'Crude': The woman in the advert appears to be talking about oral sex in the advert screened on ITV just after the watershed last night . 'Unfunny': A man in the advert who is asked to 'get it out' by the woman - in a reference to an e-cigarette . In the commercial, the woman said 'I want you to get it out' and 'I want you to put it in my mouth', in an apparent reference to a sex act. She added: 'I want to see how great it tastes'. However, in a twist at the end she makes clear that she is actually referring to an electronic cigarette. Viewers branded the advert 'disgraceful' and unfunny while others said that it glamourised smoking. The commercial screened at 9.10pm last night during I'm a Celebrity which this year stars Joey Essex from The Only Way is Essex and model Amy Willerton. Commercial: The advert screened during I'm A Celebrity last night on ITV. Laila Morse, pictured, was voted off the show . Commercial: The advert was for an electronic cigarette. It is a device that simulates smoking but does not contain the harmful chemicals . Louise Edwards Tweeted at ITV's official account that she thought the advert was inappropriate. She wrote: 'I really object to VIP advert just shown on ITV talk about the wrong messages to young people watching I’m a celeb £disgraceful.' Reece Doyle even accused the advert of promoting sex crimes. He said: 'I really do not like the VIP advert. There are obvious allusions to rape. Utterly disgraceful.' Jodie Pullman added: 'The VIP Ecig advert is awful. Needs removing off TV that does.' A teenager wrote that it was 'awkward' to watch the advert nextr to his parents. The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) confirmed they were investigating the advert for VIP Electronic Cigarettes. A spokesman said: 'The ASA has received a significant number of complaints about two TV ads for VIP electronic cigarettes. 'One ad shows a woman, and the other a man, both speaking directly to the camera. 'Complainants object that the language used in the ads is overly sexual and offensive while others object that the ad sexualises and glamorises e-cigarettes and/or smoking. 'We have now launched a formal investigation into these ads.' Makers of the e-cigarette said they had created the commercial in response to an EU ban on actually showing their product on-screen. 'Crude': Viewers also complained that the advert on ITV glamourised smoking. Watchdogs are now investigating . Offensive: The makers of the e-cigarettes defended their advert which they described as 'tongue in cheek' Miguel Corral, co-owner of VIP Electronic Cigarettes, defended the ‘tongue-in-cheek’ advert. He said: 'I think it’s safe to say that our ads could be considered controversial and definitely push boundaries. 'Due to advertising regulations we were not permitted to include the product in the ad, so we decided to take a tongue-in-cheek approach to appeal to an adult audience and communicate the superior taste of VIP products, whilst making it clear that the product does contain nicotine and that they are only available to smokers over the age of 18. 'We anticipated that the creative treatment for this campaign would cause comment and we were ready for this, but I want to make it very clear that as a leading e-cigarette manufacturer we take our responsibilities extremely seriously which is evident in our decision not to broadcast the ads before the watershed and follow the advertising rules closely.'","ITV screened the 'crude' advert just after the watershed last night .

"Yesterday, I washed down the turkey with a glass of donkey milk. After all, it’s a perfect festive drink — no Nativity scene is complete without a donkey looking over Jesus in his manger. And the flavour was surprisingly pleasant, although I expected more of a kick. It was reassuringly odourless, and looked and tasted just like skimmed cow’s milk, although a tad sweeter. But the real reason I downed the stuff is that, to some, it’s a veritable elixir. Hailed by the ancients as a cure for a variety of ailments and an anti-ageing skin tonic, donkey milk is enjoying a revival. And its popularity is likely only to grow further after Pope Francis this month revealed he was fed it as a baby in Argentina to supplement his mother’s milk. Flawless: Elizabeth Taylor, as Cleopatra, bathing in asses' milk . Pieris Georgiadis is already a convert to its benefits. As the owner of Cyprus’s biggest farm producing the milk, he drinks it daily in its fresh, unpasteurised form. At 54, he’s only a year younger than me, but looks stronger and more youthful. ‘Donkey’s milk is a serious product,’ he assures me. Certainly, scientists are becoming increasingly interested in it. The milk’s medicinal virtues were first heralded by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, who recommended it to combat a host of bodily woes, including liver problems, fevers, infectious diseases, poisoning, joint pains and nose bleeds. The Romans later added constipation to that list. The use of donkey milk as a moisturiser in cosmetics is even more fabled, thanks to Cleopatra. The Egyptian queen took a daily bath in it, with a steady stream of milk supplied by more than 700 lactating asses. The stuff ‘erases facial wrinkles, makes the skin more delicate and maintains the whiteness’, enthused Pliny the Elder, an ancient Roman know-it-all. Of course, people have drunk it as part of their daily diet, too: fresh donkey milk was widely available in 19th-century London as an alternative to the highly adulterated cows’ milk sold by dairies. Now, with more and more people looking to avoid cow’s milk products because of dairy allergies, interest in alternatives is growing. Could donkey milk repeat the success of goat and sheep milk and, more recently, camel milk? As it’s rich in lactose — a type of sugar — and low in fat, donkey milk is the closest animal milk to the human variety. Its nutritional properties may make it more suitable for the ‘2 to 6 per cent of the population’ who are allergic to cow milk, according to a UN study. D onkey milk is also vitamin-rich and contains anti-bacterial proteins and anti-allergens — substances that regulate the immune system, countering allergic reactions — reputed to alleviate skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema, as well as asthma and bronchitis. I first learned of the milk’s reputation last month when, amused to see bars of donkey milk soap, liqueur, chocolate and cosmetics in a Cypriot gift shop, I asked if they were meant as joke presents. The assistant soon set me straight. I was particularly intrigued by her account of a Dutch customer who snapped up 15 bars of the soap, declaring they were the best relief for his psoriasis, an irritating skin condition. Pope Francis, pictured as he is presented two young donkey foals and some donkey milk at the maternity unit at the Vatican's paediatric hospital, revealed he was fed donkey milk as a baby . Every few months for the past 15 years the skin under my beard and eyebrows has become red, itchy and flaky. I suspect it’s psoriasis but have never had it properly diagnosed — I usually manage to get rid of it in a few days with a cream applied topically. This year, though, the itchiness has returned more aggressively. The shop assistant directed me to her supplier: Pieris at his Golden Donkeys Farm in the hilly village of Skarinou. Home to 200 of the animals, the farm is proving a hit with both health-conscious holidaymakers and locals, many of whom remember their grandmother’s tales about the benefits of supping donkey milk. I see two elderly but sprightly-looking nuns sporting sunglasses in the farm’s gift shop snapping up several bottles of fresh donkey milk (but, God bless them, no donkey milk liqueur). They’re regulars, according to Pieris, getting the weekly supply for their community. ‘Drinking the milk is the best way to get the benefits of its antibiotic properties,’ he says. And he’s not asking people to take him on faith. To get a scientific stamp of approval, he has called the Cyprus University of Technology in Limassol to oversee his work. Dr Photis Papademas, a lecturer in dairy science, has been interviewing people who’ve been drinking milk from the farm regularly over a period of two to three months. ‘From what they say, they’ve had some remarkable results, especially children with asthma or coughs and for some with eczema and psoriasis,’ says Dr Papademas. ‘Now we’ll try to get a clinical study going on the adults to see if this milk really is as promising as it looks. We know already that traditionally it was used by people just a few generations ago to treat whooping cough in young children.’ The science behind the milk’s therapeutic properties does seem intriguing. Like humans, donkeys have a single stomach. Yet we mostly drink the milk of multi-stomached animals such as cows and goats, which use a lot of bacteria to digest their food through a complicated fermentation process. Donkey milk is not only very close to human milk in composition but contains protective anti-bacterial agents — one of which ‘seems to be maybe 200 times more active than in cow’s milk’, says Dr Papademas. This might explain why donkey’s milk appears to be particularly free of germs. ‘As a scientist I’m always cautious, but this milk looks promising,’ he says. So, why aren’t we all drinking donkey milk already? At €24 (£19) a litre in Cyprus it doesn’t come cheap, and the average price in other countries is twice that. In Europe, it’s produced in France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Holland, Serbia and Bosnia; far more is produced in Latin American countries. Two years ago, there were reports tennis ace Novak Djokovic had bought up his country’s entire supply of donkey milk for a chain of restaurants he’d opened in Serbia . The problem is a jenny — a female donkey — produces just a litre of milk a day for six to seven months a year, while a cow can deliver 30 times as much. Also, a donkey won’t produce milk unless it’s stimulated by the presence of its foal, and milking has to be done manually. But only a little is needed to feel the benefits, according to Pieris, He recommends drinking just 60ml a day — ‘all you need to protect your body’. He also uses donkey milk to make an unusual liqueur, which looks and tastes like Baileys Irish Cream, but isn’t quite as creamy. British aficionados can buy donkey milk and products such as soaps, moisturisers, creams, shower gels and body lotions online. Eurolactis, the company that recently gave the Pope a couple of donkeys, is one supplier (eurolactis.com). And a Swiss chef is already testing recipes with donkey cheese. ‘When you add in sugar and chocolate, in particular, the taste is amazing,’ Jean-Michel Evequoz told Modern Farmer magazine. He’s working on an ‘emulsion of donkey’s milk and wild flowers to complement a poached lobster’. Pieris has no intention of turning his precious milk to cheese, however. ‘Donkey milk has virtually no fat —just 0.5 per cent — so you’d need 100 kilos of it to make one kilo of cheese,’ he explains. ‘Imagine how much you’d have to sell it for. In Serbia it costs €1,000 (£800) a kilo.’ Indeed, the crumbly white cheese is a coveted Serbian delicacy, known as pule. Two years ago, there were reports that tennis ace Novak Djokovic had bought up his country’s entire supply for a chain of restaurants he’d opened in his homeland. He denied the claims, but it’s nice to think donkey milk might be the secret of his sporting success. Andy Murray should give it a try. Back in Skarinou, Pieris loads with me presents: a bottle of the donkey milk liqueur, a tin of his extra virgin olive oil, which contains aromatic basil grown on the farm, and some delicious chocolate containing pasteurised donkey milk that tastes like Bournville. But I’m most chuffed by the two bars of donkey milk soap that he pops in my gift bag. Back home I lather it on — the itchiness under my beard goes within an hour. Three weeks on there’s no recurrence. The milk’s benefits may not yet be clinically proven, but I’m a convert. My brother, a fellow sceptic, is also braying with delight. The eczema on his hands has cleared up after a week. ‘This soap seems to be doing the trick,’ he says. ‘Is it coincidence? I’ll keep using it to see.’ I just hope those nuns don’t buy up the entire stock.","Hailed as an ancient cure for various ailments and an anti-ageing skin tonic .

"She gave hope to millions of women everywhere when she appeared outside hospital with her new baby, Prince George, sporting a noticeable baby bump. But just five weeks later, the Duchess of Cambridge has managed to sensationally snap back into shape  - and is even sporting her pre-pregnancy skinny jeans.

Happy: Kate and William looked relaxed and radiant as they arrived to start the Anglesey ultra marathon . Despite the uneven surfaces in the Holyhead Breakwater Country Park she also sported her favourite black wedges. Kate has always been a sporty young woman and kept fit throughout her pregnancy by walking her dog, Lupo, and taking part in regular ante-natal yoga classes. Yoga not only helps mothers stay healthy before the birth but is also believed to help them regain their figure afterwards by ‘training’ their muscles. Sarah Barrett, Managing Editor of pregnancy and parenting website BabyCentre UK said: ‘Antenatal yoga is an excellent choice for pregnant women. It’s different from traditional yoga and is a great way to stay in shape both during pregnancy and to help new mums get back into shape after pregnancy. ‘Practicing yoga is also an excellent way to prepare you for labour and the birth of your baby. Kate obviously looks fantastic – and we wouldn’t be surprised if a little yoga was part of her secret.’ Although Prince William recently revealed that his wife was bearing the brunt of baby George’s night feeds - and that their son was proving to be quite a nocturnal little fellow - the Duchess appeared remarkably bright-eyed as she chatted with well-wishers at the start of a gruelling marathon race her husband had agreed to officially start. The Duchess revealed that her mother, Carole, - or granny as she called her - had come up to babysit. 'He's doing very well. He's with granny at the moment.

Miss Blake from Holyhead said: 'They seem down to earth, you know. I thought they might find it fun.' The prince himself had the crowds laughing when a baby cried loudly as he walked past. 'We're hearing a bit of that at the moment,' he joked as he cupped his hand to his ear. His wife added; 'He (George) is sleeping at the moment for now - fingers' crossed!' At one point the Duchess seemed rather thrown when she encountered George Bailey, nine, from Manchester who had been cycling in the area with his family while on holiday. As she bent down to chat, George told her matter of factly: 'I don't see the point of a royal family.' 'Oh, well, oh' Kate stuttered. Fortunately he then added: 'Until today.'

The Duke of Cambridge spoke to well wishers at Breakwater Country Park at the start of the race . The Duchess told some well wishers fans how fast George was growing. 'We were talking about the joy she was having from George, and how quickly he was changing. She couldn¿t quite believe how fast he was changing. He was getting quite huge,' said one . The Duchess also said she was keen to get 'back into shape' following George's birth. Will Stewart, park warden at Holyhead Breakwater Country Park where William rang a bell to start the Ring O’Fire Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon, said the Duchess told him she was “genuinely interested” in doing some more walking around the area – “especially after the baby'. He said: 'She said she wants to get back into shape. I said, ‘You don’t need to worry about that.’ She looked great.' Marian Wyn Jones, the High Sheriff of Gwynedd, said the Duchess told her how fast George was growing. 'We were talking about the joy she was having from George, and how quickly he was changing. She couldn’t quite believe how fast he was changing. He was getting quite huge.' Mrs Jones also spoke to William about his attempts to master the Welsh language, most recently witnessed when he made a speech in Welsh at the Anglesey County Show earlier this month. “He asked what the reception had been to his venture into the Welsh language. It was very well received.' Not by all, however. “He mentioned that a couple of girls at [RAF] Valley had been critical of a few points.' He fared less well with Annwen Mary Jones, a 49-year-old hairdresser. “I said to him, ‘Prynhawn Da, William’ – Good afternoon. He said, ‘Bora Da’ – Good morning. I said, ‘No, good afternoon!’ 'But he is doing all right. Fair play to him. It is a difficult language to learn.' The prince himself had the crowds laughing when a baby cried loudly as he walked past. 'We're hearing a bit of that at the moment,' he joked as he cupped his hand to his ear . Jazmine Tomblin, aged six, her sister Hollie, aged nine and their friend Megan Emery-Jones, aged seven, handed a posy of flowers to Kate and a home-made card with a picture of a butterfly made especially for Prince George. Holly said: 'She said, ‘Where do you live?’ and said ‘We will be coming back soon to visit.’ 'We made a butterfly for him with loads of glitter on. She said George really likes bright colours. She's pretty.' Megan's mother, Louise Emery-Jones, 38, from Menai Bridge, Anglesey, said locals would miss the royal couple, who have been seen living a normal life and during their time on the Island. 'She's been seen shopping in Waitrose, out and about and on the beach at Rhosneigr. 'They have done wonders for the tourist industry. I think it’s been a lovely life for them here. It's a shame they can't live here. 'They've been allowed to just get on with their lives, but obviously things have changed.' Ring O' Fire is an annual 135 mile coastal ultra marathon circumnavigating the Isle of Anglesey, North Wales . Kate joined husband Prince William as he officially started the island marathon on Anglesey . Kate and William looked the picture of happiness when they left the Lindo Wing the day after George's birth . The . Duchess's next official engagement will be on September 12 when she . attends the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards with her husband in . London. Today's event is . the prince's last official engagement on the island before leaving to . take up a new military posting next month. He has lived in a rented farmhouse in North Wales for just over three years, the last two with wife Kate. After . George's birth the couple went to live with Kate's parents, Michael and . Carole Middleton, at their £4.8 million mansion in Bucklebury, . Berkshire. William returned . to his job as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley two weeks later . following the end of his statutory paternity leave. Kate and his son then joined him a a fortnight ago. The Ring O’ Fire Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon is a gruelling annual 135 mile coastal marathon circumnavigating the entire island. At the start of the race, William will meet a number of the runners and their families as well as a selection of volunteers involved in organising it. Over three days runners will follow the island's coastal path, much of which is designated an 'Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty'. Kate's decision to attend suggests that 'little rascal' George may be sleeping more at night . Competitors encounter a wide variety of terrain, including estuaries sandy beaches, cliff top paths, sand dunes, fields, forest and road. The 135 mile distance and 13,695 feet of vertical ascent make the Ring O’ Fire one of the most extreme ultra marathons in the United Kingdom. Race Directors, Quentin Brooksbank and James Bingham started the gruelling event as an 'inspirational challenge' that attracts international runners to the island that they grew up on. In a statement Kensington Palace said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge will now attend the Ring O’ Fire Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon with The Duke of Cambridge this afternoon. 'The Duchess will join The Duke in meeting a number of the runners and their families and a selection of volunteers involved in the administration of the race before The Duke officially starts the Ultra Marathon. ‬ 'The Duke and Duchess will not take Prince George to the event.'

"Did he do it? Law students have suggested Ronald Lee Moore could have killed Hae Min Lee in 1999 . The University of Virginia's Innocence Project has identified another suspect who they say could be linked to the death of Hae Min Lee, whose murder was the focus of the hit podcast series 'Serial'. Ronald Lee Moore, who was released from prison 10 days before Lee vanished in January 1999, could have been responsible for her death, they say, and they are now hoping to test physical evidence in the case against his DNA. He killed himself in 2012. Lee's body was found in a Baltimore park just weeks after she broke up with her boyfriend, Adnan Syed, who was ultimately convicted of murder and is now serving life in prison for the death. Syed, then 17, has always insisted that he was over their break up and did not murder her, and there was no physical evidence linking him to the crime. But a friend, identified on the podcast as 'Jay', claims Syed told him he had murdered her and helped him bury her body. His story and the investigation around Lee's murder were the subject of the highly-popular podcast series, Serial, and in the final episode, UVA's Innocence Project suggested other suspects. In an interview with TIME, Deirdre Enright, the head of the Innocence Project at UVA, suggested that Moore could have had a part in her death. Moore, who committed suicide while in prison in 2012, aged 40, was identified as a suspect in a 1999 rape and a 1999 cold case rape-murder when his DNA later matched the crimes. Accused: Adnan Syed, left, is serving a life sentence for the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, but has always said he is innocent. The podcast series, Serial, delved into the crime to see if he was guilty . In one case reported in the L'Observateur at the time of his suicide, police said a DNA match in 2006 connected him to a sexual assault in which he broke into a woman's apartment, shocked her with a cattle prod, and forced her to perform sex acts on him. Earlier this year, the Baltimore Sun reported that another DNA match connected him to a 1999 murder, in which he broke into 27-year-old Annelise Hyang Suk Lee's apartment and strangled her. Sarah Koenig, who produced the podcast, ultimately did not conclude whether Syed was guilty or not . He was arrested for burglary in December 2011 - and was listed as one of America’s Most Wanted Fugitives at the time. He ultimately took his life in 2012. Enright believes he could have had something to do with Lee's murder in January 1999. 'In some ways, he was ideal because he had been released from prison and fit the timeframe for Hae's murder because he had been out for 10 days when she was murdered,' she told TIME. But Enright said she and her team are also pursuing other theories and looking into other potential suspects - who cannot be named because they are still alive - while they wait for the courts to test the evidence, which could take months. Enright admitted there were some problems with Moore as a suspect, including that he had been tied to sexual assaults but Lee was apparently not sexually assaulted. However, Enright said that she knows a rape kit was carried out on Lee's body - and that it was not tested. 'What we know is that Hae had her clothes on, although I know her shirt and bra had been moved up,' Enright told TIME. 'And her skirt was on but pushed up... There were hairs on her body, two of which were microscopically compared to Adnan, and he was excluded and they didn't belong to her either.' If it comes back as a match with Moore's DNA, it should show Adnan is not guilty, she said. Close: Friends said Syed moved on after his break up from Lee but prosecutors said he killed her out of anger . Alternatively, it could match someone else who's already locked up, or it could belong to someone not known to the authorities - but that, too, should clear Syed of her murder, she said. 'If there was semen and it was not her boyfriend and it was not Adnan, and we still couldn't point out a serial killer or a serial rapist, I would still argue - depending on what that physical evidence there was - that that should also exculpate Adnan,' she told TIME. One problem with Moore as the suspect is that Jay led police to Lee's car after he said he and Syed buried her body, and Enright cannot yet account for this. 'But I wonder about whether Jay somehow got involved with people who had some other entire scheme going on and it's them he's afraid of,' she said. She added that Serial host Sarah Koenig may have uncovered some leads they can pursue, mostly legal quibbles, while Reddit users have also suggested another suspect.","Warning: Contains spoilers .

"A hybrid of table tennis and football, headis is a game that is catching on in its native Germany and beyond. Invented by Rene Wegner, and popular already in universities throughout his homeland, headis uses the tactics of tennis and ping pong with the primary skill, the header, borrowed from football. The rules are similar to those in table tennis, with the same table used, but there are a few obvious exceptions. For one, instead of a small plastic ball and a paddle the headis ball is seven inches in diameter and weighs about 100 grams. Scroll down for video . A game of headis, a mix of table tennis and football, is played in front of a small but enthusiastic gallery . It is made out of rubber and has special bouncing qualities. Volleys are allowed as well as touching the table. A game is made up of two sets each to 11 points, and just like table tennis the set's winner must be leading by two points. According to Mr Wegner, 2,000 headis balls have been sold this year, compared to a 2013 total of 1,300, as more and more people give it a try. This video shows competitors from near and far gathering on Saturday in the German town of Unna to take part in a tournament. A headis player used her hands for balance, an important element in the game that is fast catching on . A competitor in a headis tournament in Unna, Germany, shapes to play his shot with his head . The game is serious stuff - players launch themselves at shots, leaping onto the table in the hope of winning the point. Headis was invented in 2006 by Wegner, while he was a student at Germany's Saarland University. It is now part of the sports programme in at least 15 universities in the country, and is creeping into the Czech Republic educational establishments. Sales of headis balls have continued to grow year on year as the game kicks off around the world . Headis is popular on the university circuit in Germany, and is creeping into Czech Republic too . As with any game, there's winners and losers; here are the victors from the Unna tournament . Speaking to the Wall Street Journal in September, Wegner said: 'In the beginning, people were like, what are you doing, you idiots?' recalled Mr Wegner. But with a recent tournament attracting 100 competitors, being named a finalist in the international sports industry start-up competition and setting up a company in the headis name, this is one game that could certainly catch on.","Headis was invented in 2006 by German René Wegner .

"On their way into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Guns N' Roses got together for one more gig. Axl Rose missed it. The hedonistic hard rockers, who became the world's top music act amid endless dysfunction, reunited for three songs on Saturday night before 6,000 fans, many of whom were thrilled to see at least most of the band's original lineup jam on classic hits like 'Sweet Child O' Mine' and 'Paradise City.' Rose, the band's frontman and ringmaster of the G N' R traveling sex, drugs and rock and roll circus, declined to attend the induction, saying he did not want to be part of the ceremony because it 'doesn't appear to be somewhere I'm actually wanted or respected'. Reunited: Guns N' Roses' Duff McKagan, left, Matt Sorum, top left, Steven Adler, top right, and Slash, right, perform with guest vocalist Myles Kennedy after induction onto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . He was hardly missed. While his decision disappointed some hardcore fans and ended any possibility of a full-scale reunion of the original lineup, guitarist Slash, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steve Adler performed for the first time in nearly 20 years to the delight of the sell-out crowd inside historic Public Hall. Guns N' Roses were one of the headliners of this year's eclectic group of inductees, which included the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Beastie Boys, folk icon Donovan, late singer-songwriter Laura Nyro and British bands the Small Faces and Faces. The event lasted well into the early morning with an All-Star jam featuring some of rock's biggest names closing the five-and-a-half hour ceremony with a stirring rendition of Stevie Wonder's 'Higher Ground'. Hours earlier, Chili Peppers lead singer Anthony Kiedis said it was strange to be enshrined while the band was touring. 'We're going somewhere,' Kiedis said. 'How can we stop and take an award when really we're just halfway there? But it is nice to be together with people that we spent some incredible years along the way writing songs and playing shows in little theaters and sweaty little transvestite clubs and having the time of our lives.' Crowd-pleasers: Guns N' Roses performs in front of 6,000 fans at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday, April 14, 2012, in Cleveland . Inducted: Drummer Steven Adler waves during the band's performance, left, and Duff McKagan throws his fist in the air, right . Happy: Guns N' Roses, from left: Matt Sorum, Duff McKagan, Slash and Steven Adler, after their crowd-pleasing performance . Cleveland rocked without Rose. As he inducted Guns N' Roses, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong recalled the first time he saw the band on MTV. 'I thought, one these guys could end up dead or in jail,' he said. Guns N' Roses came out both barrels blaring and their debut album 'Appetite For Destruction', shook a music world that at the time was consumed with pop ballads and dance music. 'It's the best debut album in the history of rock and roll,' Armstrong said. 'Every song hits hard. It takes you a trip to the seedy world of Los Angeles. The thing that set them apart from everyone else was guts. They never lost their edge for one second.' Armstrong talked about each of the Guns members, talking about Slash's mastery and Adler's pulsive, pounding beats before pausing. 'Let's see, who am I missing?' The reference to Rose drew boos and catcalls that Armstrong tried to shout down. 'He's one of the best frontmen to ever touch a microphone,' Armstrong said. McKagan and Slash did not mention Rose during their brief remarks but then took the stage with Myles Kennedy, a member of a side project with Slash, singing lead vocals. No show: Guns N' Roses' Duff McKagan, center and Slash, right, perform with guest vocalist Myles Kennedy after Axl Rose refused to attend . Like Guns N' Roses, the Red Hot Chili . Peppers emerged from Los Angeles during the 1980s when Sunset Strip's . rock scene was dominated by 'hair' bands more concerned with their tight . lycra pants and eyeliner than their sound. Not the Chili Peppers, who . found their unique groove by blending punk, funk, rock and rap. While their lineup has undergone some changes - founding guitarist Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose in 1988 - Kiedis and bassist Flea have survived personal highs and lows and the band remains one of music's top live acts. Kiedis said Slovak would have loved the honor. 'I think that he would have a good laugh,' Kiedis said. 'Yeah, it would certainly mean something to him as he cared deeply about music and the love of the brotherhood of being in a band and being a creative force in the universe, which he is and always will be a brother in everything we do.' Comedian Chris Rock, a longtime fan and friend of the band, inducted the Chili Peppers. 'If (Beach Boy) Brian Wilson (funkmaster) George Clinton had a kid he would be ugly,' Rock said. 'But he would sound like the Red Hot Chili Peppers.' The Chili Peppers took the stage at 1 a.m. and opened a four-song set with 'By The Way' with drummer Chad Smith flanked by Jack Irons and Cliff Martinez, two former drummers with the band. Flea gave a moving speech in which spoke of his passion to play for the musicians before him. He choked back tears as he thanked his mother.

Elated: Matt Sorum gestures as Duff McKagan, back left, Steven Adler and Slash, back right, watch . Three white middle-class smart alecks . from New York City, the Beastie Boys were initially dismissed as . beer-swilling frat boys following their 1986 debut album 'License To . Ill', which featured songs like '(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To . Party!)' and 'Girls'. But their follow-up, 'Paul's Boutique,' was . acclaimed by critics and brought the Beasties credibility in the black . hip-hop community. 'It broke the mold,' said Public Enemy's Chuck D, later citing one of the group's lines. 'The Beastie Boys are indeed three bad brothers who made history. They brought a whole new look to rap and hip-hop. They proved that rap could come from any street - not just a few.' Only two of the three Beasties attended the ceremony. Michael 'Mike D' Diamond, Adam 'Ad-Rock' Horovitz read a speech by Adam 'MCA' Yauch, who has been fighting cancer. The Beasties are just the third hip-hop act to enter the hall, joining Grand Master Flash and the Furious Five and Run DMC. Kid Rock joined the Roots in a medley of Beastie hits, including 'No Sleep `Til Brooklyn' and 'Sabotage'. Stevie Van Zandt, one of Bruce Springsteen's sidemen in the E Street Band, inducted the Small Faces and Faces, bands that included Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, two rock superstars. Van Zandt credited the underrated bands for having a major influence on generations of rockers. He said both were blessed to have strong lead singers in the late Steve Marriott and Rod Stewart. 'Not many bands get two lives or two of the greatest white soul singers in the history of rock and roll,' he said.

Stewart came down with the flu this week . and couldn't attend. Simply Red's lead singer Mick Hucknall, a friend . of the band, filled on three songs including the classic 'Stay With Me,' with Wood, previously inducted with the Rolling Stones, delivering an . exquisite slide guitar. During a speech that was at times comical but heartfelt throughout, John Mellencamp inducted Donovan, a balladeer from the flower-power 1960s once labeled 'the new Dylan.' Donovan Leitch had a string of hits in the `60s with 'Sunshine Superman,' 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' and 'Mellow Yellow.' During his remarks, Mellencamp raised the copy of Donovan's 'Fairy Tale' album he bought 47 years ago as a kid in Indiana. 'I wasn't just listening to Donovan, I was living Donovan,' Mellencamp said. 'He was my inspiration. One of the original originals.' The influential Nyro, who died in 1997, never reached commercial success but wrote hits for other artists. She was inducted by singer Bette Midler. 'I loved her the moment I dropped the needle on the vinyl,' Midler said. 'She was the very essence of New York City. Not in the gritty real sense, but in the passionate, romantic, ethereal, eternal sense.' Carole King inducted late rock promoter Don Kirchner, who helped launch the careers of Prince and the Eagles. Smokey Robinson inducted long-deserving backup bands for early rock artists. The groups included Buddy Holly's The Crickets, James Brown's The Famous Flames, Bill Hailey's The Comets and Robinson's The Miracles.",Beastie Boys and Red Hot Chilli Peppers also honoured .
"The Pentagon has designed a massive spy satellite that will dwarf any space telescope ever launched - and it point its sensitive lens back at us. The Membrane Optical Imager for Real-Time Exploitation (MOIRE) will be capable of capturing 40percent of the surface of the Earth at once. It will be able to beam back real-time high-resolution video and images from anywhere in the world at any time. The satellite is the brainchild of DARPA, the Pentagon agency tasked with developing the next generation of weapons and technology for the U.S. military. This is an artist's rending of the Membrane Optical Imager for Real-Time Exploitation (MOIRE) satellite that the Pentagon hopes to launch to spy on the earth . This is one of the membrane panels from a prototype of the MOIRE satellite that completed testing on earth . And it relies on a remarkable technological advancement that could increase the power and precision of space telescopes by several fold - while making them less costly, Wired magazine reports. MOIRE uses massive membranes that will be shot into orbit collapsed, but once aloft, can expand to 68 feet in diameter. Currently, the largest ground-based telescope is about half that size. The space-based Hubble Telescope is less than eight feet in diameter. The membrane will be the thickness of household kitchen wrap, but will diffract light - instead of reflecting it or refracting it with mirrors like traditional glass optics. Massive: This drawing shows how much bigger MOIRE is designed to be (68 feet) compared to the Hubble Space Telescope, the W.M. Keck Observatory telescope - which is one of the largest ground-based instruments in the world - and the James Webb Space Telescope, a device planned for launch in 2018 . This is a prototype full lens of the MOIRE satellite. There is no launch date for the telescope yet, but developers say it is in its final phase . Until now, the scope and precision of space telescopes was limited by the size of their lens, which are quickly becoming too heavy and expensive to carry into space - even for the largest rockets. 'Membrane optics could enable us to fit much larger, higher-resolution telescopes in smaller and lighter packages,' Lieutenant Colonel Larry Gunn, a program manager for MOIRE, told Wired. 'In that respect, we’re ""breaking the glass ceiling"" that traditional materials impose on optics design.' The MOIRE satellite will be both cheaper to produce and cheaper to deploy, if the design works out because it doesn't require the high-quality glass. DARPA has already tested a ground-based prototype of the project. Researchers will now move into the final phase of the project. No completion date has been made publicly available as yet.","Membrane Optical Imager for Real-Time Exploitation (MOIRE) uses a massive web of thin membranes instead of heavy lenses .

"Call it a Christmas miracle, or a stroke of absolute luck, but a dying Alabama man believes a stray dog he picked up on the street has helped him fight off incurable cancer and live to see Christmas. Doctors told 84-year-old Bill Hogencamp, of Phenix, that wouldn't see December 25 this year after being diagnosed with cancer of the gall bladder, liver, colon and the lining of his abdomen in May. And he accepted his fate. 'I have seven children and I've traveled all around the world,' Hogencamp told ABC News. 'I thought, if this is it, then this is it.' Scroll down for video . Cured: Father-of-seven Bill Hogencamp, 84, was told he wouldn't see out the year after being diagnosed with cancer of the gall bladder, liver, colon and lining of his abdomen, but he believes a dog his wife picked up off the street, who they called Mahjong, saved him. The two are pictured here together . But Hogencamp and his wife, Kathy, made the decision to still try and fight. In October he had surgery to remove three large tumors. After the surgery, Kathy went to pick up her husband from a rehabilitation center, she noticed a dog dangerously wandering down the road. Kathy, and some other cars, slowed down so as to not hit the pup. But after walking past several cars, he came up to hers and put his paws up on her door. She opened the door and let the dog get in, the continued to get her husband. However he was not happy that she decided to take in a stray. 'I hadn't had a dog in twenty years and I had no desire to have a dog,' Hogencamp said. 'I kept saying we need to find his owner.' A long subsequent search yielded a no answers, and while a vet told the couple the Maltese had been fixed, he was not micro-chipped. Savior: The Hogencamp family say it's as if Mahjong knew he had to help them . They had little option but to keep the dog, and named him Mahjong after Kathy's favorite card game, which is similar to solitaire. Mahjong fell in love with Hogencamp and rarely left his side. He would jump on Hogencamp's lap at any chance and fall alseep with him during naps. Hogencamp then chose to undergo chemotherapy as a further attempt to rid his bodies of the tumors. Incredibly, doctors later informed the shocked couple that tests had deemed Hogencamp cancer-free. 'My life has been a miracle,' Hogencamp said. 'And now Mahjong is part of that miracle.' Hogencamp and his wife believe Mahjong found them in a time of need, and somehow understood it was his responsibility to help the man fight cancer. 'The dog seemed to know right away that Bill was sick and it was his job to take care of him -- and Bill knew it was his job to take care of the dog,' Kathy Hogencamp told ABC.","Bill Hogencamp, 84, of Phenix, Alabama, was diagnosed with cancer of the gall bladder, liver, colon and the lining of his abdomen in May .

'The overshoot of vodka prices leads only to increasing consumption of bootleg (spirits),' said Putin, who is known for promoting a healthy lifestyle. 'I think the relevant structures (government bodies) should think of that,' he added. According to a study by leading international universities last year, a quarter of all Russian men die before they reach their mid-fifties, and their love of alcohol - particularly vodka - is partly to blame. The government-regulated minimum retail price of half a litre of vodka has been increased by around 30 percent since last year to 220 roubles (£2.40). Russia has been tightening regulations for producers of vodka and beer, such as Russia's Synergy, Poland's CEDC and Danish brewer Carlsberg. Russia's economy is expected to slide into recession in 2015 due to falling oil prices and Western sanction over the Ukraine crisis. Annual inflation, meanwhile, is expected to exceed 10 percent this year. Putin's popularity is partly based on his reputation for providing prosperity and stability, but Russia is currently facing its worst economic crisis since 1998 .","His popularity is partly based on reputation for providing prosperity .

"Perilously perched over the edge of a raised pavement, bursting through a fence and even left on top of a concrete bollard - these photographs show the hilarious, and often dangerous, parking feats attempted by some of Britain's worst drivers. Photographs posted on social media . channels are providing a catalogue of parking disasters on the country’s . roads, as bemused Twitter and Instagram users shame those who struggle . behind the steering wheel. The pictures, which have been taken across the country, include a black Mercedes parked on a double, yellow line and on the corner of a T-junction. Scroll down for video . Shamed: In one of many examples of poor parking posted online, this car has been left on top of a bollard (and the driver has ignored the double yellow lines) Overhang: Perhaps this driver didn't realise the kerb would become a wall as they drove up this pavement? Dangerous: This black Mercedes has been left across a T junction, and a double yellow line . Blurred lines: Perhaps this Golf driver did not see the lines marking out the parking spaces in this car park . In another insurance-busting picture, a motorist has attempted tor by reversing into a space filled by a hatchback, which has in turn smashed into a fence. One picture even shows a car parked in a grass ditch, while another is of a Mercedes 4x4 straddling a raised concrete curb in a busy B&Q car park. Another image shows two cars, a Honda and a Vauxhall, which are parked side-by-side but are so close together, they are almost touching. The positioning of the cars would make . it impossible for the driver to get back in the Vauxhall, let alone . drive off without smashing their wing mirrors. There are also plenty of drivers who have ignored the spacious white lines and parked across two spaces. Impact: The driver of this car has reversed into this hatchback, and pushed the other vehicle into a fence . Blocked: The drivers who have parked properly in these disabled spaces will be in for a surprise when they return to find this Audi blocking their route out . Cross country: The driver of this hatchback has left the road behind, leaving the car on the edge of patch of grass, having reversed onto a pathway . Too much space: The Fiat 500's compact sizes usually makes life easier for drivers trying to fit into a tight spot - but this motorist needed two spaces to park . Another shot to be posted is of a black Vauxhall parked precariously on top of a concrete bollard. According to the Ford Motor Company, many drivers find it increasingly difficult to park as cars have got steadily larger, while parking spaces have remained the same. 'Statistics show that as car size increases in line with safety and fashion (10-17 per cent larger than their automotive predecessors) many drivers are struggling to master the art of parking them,' said a spokesman. 'Indeed, 72 per cent of car-owning households in UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain have reported parking-related door damage – at a cost of as much as £300 per door. 'Meanwhile, the minimum measurements of a car space have remained static since 1994.' Hanging out: This driver (left) clearly struggled with the concept of parallel parking, while this driver may not have noticed the curb when they left their car outside this Tesco supermarket (right) Hazard: Other motorists would struggle to get around this car safely after the driver abandoned it on a kerb .

"A father and son are part of a group of seven Florida men accused of prostituting a 16-year-old girl and forcing her to have group sex while they plied her with drugs, prosecutors say. The high school student was reported missing by her school and disappeared for a week while she was driven across Miami-Dade and told to earn $1,288 for the group, according to police. The Miami Herald reports that the girl climbed into a black Ford Taurus with one woman and two men on December 4 after school. Scroll down for video . Accused: Derrick Powell, Sr, (left) and Derrick Powell, Jr, (right) are part of a group charged with trafficking a 16-year-old girl into prostitution while feeding her drugs . She was then given alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, an amphetamine-like synthetic drug with hallucinogenic effects. She was coerced into sex acts with at least 16 men over the week she was missing, including two occasions where she was forced to have sex with up to 8 men at once, authorities said. 'Every time you think you have seen the worst of the worst, a case like this pops up,' State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told NBC. 'It's nauseating. It's horrifying and unspeakable,' she added. 'How human beings could be so barbaric to each other is a mystery to me.' Police charged 43-year-old Derrick Powell, Sr, with sexual battery. The man's own son, 18-year-old Derrick Powell, Jr, was also charged with assault. Five other suspects, Craig Hill, Mark Evans, Branden Sands, Jerome Grace and Edward Cornelius, ranging from ages 24 to 42, are also in custody.

Prosecutors say the girl was located in Overtown a week after she was taken and taken immediately to the hospital. The next morning, she identified the homes where she trafficked between, and police moved in to make arrests. Several of the men have prior convictions, including manufacturing and sale of illegal drugs, according to Florida inmate records. Police say the investigation is ongoing and are seeking the woman in the car and another man to question them about a possible connection to the crime.","Derrick Powell, Sr, is charged with sexual battery and Derrick Powell, Jr, is charged with assault .

"Possibility: The idea that Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, of Buckinghamshire, might have ordered the attack - or even led it herself - is not far-fetched at all . Last night, as the bodies were still being counted at the shopping mall, one British woman was notably slow to join the condemnation. For Samantha Lewthwaite, the daughter of a former British soldier who grew up attending school discos in Buckinghamshire, views these awful events as a cause for jubilation. Kenyan anti-terror police revealed yesterday that Lewthwaite - who is known to many as the White Widow - may be the brains behind the operation to bring terror to the heart of Kenya, a country once  synonymous with the sexual high-jinks of the Happy Valley expatriate set, but rapidly becoming a new battleground in the war between Islamists and the West. ‘I suspect this woman Lewthwaite is behind this attack,’ a senior anti-terror source told me last night as survivors described how a woman in a veil appeared to be commanding the other terrorists as they hunted down and killed non-Muslim shoppers. The idea that she might have ordered the attack – or even led it herself – is not far-fetched at all. Having converted to Islam as a young woman and married a man who went on to be a 7/7 London suicide bomber, she has become a key figure in the terror group behind this weekend’s attack. Lewthwaite has even been involved in training a group of all-female suicide attackers at camps in lawless neighbouring Somalia. Scroll down for video . Mall massacre: Civilians who had been hiding during a gun battle hold their hands in the air as a precautionary measure before being searched by armed police leading them to safety, inside the Westgate mall in Nairobi . It is an extraordinary, macabre journey into darkness for the 29-year-old, who grew up as a normal teenager in Aylesbury before meeting Jermaine Lindsay, a British Muslim, in an online chat room when she was 17. The pair married three years later. When her husband was named as one of four suicide bombers who blew up Tube trains and a bus in 2005, killing 52 people, Lewthwaite initially condemned her late husband’s attack and denied any knowledge of his plan. This was a lie. More than eight years later, Lewthwaite is one of Al Qaeda’s main recruiters in East Africa and is an official spokesman for Al Shabaab (The People), the terrorist group behind the horror in Nairobi. As well as railing against ‘infidels in the West’, Lewthwaite had previously used a Twitter account to denounce a rival foreign terrorist in the text-speak of a teenager. ‘Fyi [for your information] sam . lewthwaite thinks u r a irritating obnoxious contemptible little Muj . PRAT,’ she wrote. (‘Muj’ is a contraction of mujahideen – a jihadist). Backup: More soldiers from the Kenya Defence Force arrived to strengthen the already large numbers of troops available to deal with the siege at the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya . The object of her anger was Omar Shafik Hammami, a former student from Alabama. Last week he was shot dead in an ambush by terrorists loyal to the White Widow. ‘May his fate serve as a lesson to all those who want to follow in his footsteps as a poster boy for jihad,’ Lewthwaite wrote gleefully on Twitter. Teenage years: Samantha Lewthwaite grew up attending school discos in Buckinghamshire . To add to her name for ruthlessness, the White Widow did not mention in her tweets that a British man reputed to be her second husband was also killed in the ambush. Her fearless reputation within Africa’s growing Islamic terror network has been strengthened by her own involvement as a mujahid – or warrior – during a series of bombings and shootings in Kenya’s tourist areas. Known to her devoted followers as dada muzungu – Swahili for white sister – Lewthwaite moved to Kenya with her three children in 2007. A small, dumpy woman, she cut off all links with her family in Britain and became immersed in East Africa’s Islamic terror networks, forging links with other British fanatics who had come to Kenya to wage ‘jihad’ against non-believers. It was last year that details of Lewthwaite’s secret new life emerged in grisly detail. A white woman, later identified as Lewthwaite, had led a group of terrorists who fired grenades into a bar in Mombasa, the Kenyan coastal tourist resort popular with Britons. Three people, including a child, were killed and more than 50 injured. In truth, I was deeply sceptical when news was first leaked two years ago about the White Widow’s alleged role as a terrorist with the group now causing carnage in Nairobi. Yet now, having spent time among her acolytes in the Islamic stronghold where she once lived near Mombasa, and in briefings with police, prosecutors and senior investigators during subsequent investigations in Nairobi, I have no doubt that Lewthwaite is a cold-blooded killer and a dangerous ideologue. Senior officers in Kenya have told me . they will kill her on sight. So far, however, she has avoided arrest by . wearing all-concealing Islamic dress as she has flitted between Somalia, . Kenya and Tanzania. Former home: The 29-year-old grew up as a normal teenager in Aylesbury (file picture), Buckinghamshire, before meeting a British Muslim in an online chat room when she was 17. The pair married three years later . Meanwhile, the group she is allied to continues to wreak havoc in the region. Al Shabaab grew out of the chaos of Somalia, and has seen jihadists wage a brutal war to impose strict sharia law in the East African state. 'I suspect this woman Lewthwaite is behind this attack' Senior anti-terror source . But Kenyan forces, supported by Britain and America, have been waging war across the border in Somalia in an attempt to keep the Islamists from power. With the war against Al Shabaab in Somalia proving highly effective, Kenya’s support has made it a key enemy of the Islamists. Even before this weekend’s attack, the activities of Lewthwaite and her fellow terrorists had turned Kenya into a place of fear and paranoia. Clearly, the White Widow has a taste for blood. It remains to be seen whether she will live long enough to kill again.","Samantha Lewthwaite grew up as normal teenager in Buckinghamshire .

"It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football! There's £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest-scoring manager! As the Premier League season gets going, Sportsmail take a look at players new to the top flight with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. DARYL JANMAAT IN A NUTSHELL . The domino effect of Arsene Wenger taking Mathieu Debuchy to Arsenal saw Newcastle  seek a replacement. That prompted manager Alan Pardew to bring in a right-back by the name of Daryl Janmaat. The 25-year-old from Feyenoord, arriving for a cool £5million, gave those in Tyneside a taster of what he is capable of with Holland at the World Cup in Brazil. There, he brought his total caps to 21 since making his debut against Turkey in September 2012. From U20 to U21 to the senior level under now-Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, Janmaat looks a player the 52,000 at St James' Park can get excited about. New boy: Holland right-back Daryl Janmaat  moved to Newcastle United from Feyenoord for a cool £5million . All smiles: The 24-year-old is an attacking full-back and is expected to fit straight into Newcastle's defence . Looking up: Janmaat is quick and likely to excite the 52,000 at St James' Park with his overlapping runs . Debuchy would cost you £5.1m in our Fantasy Football game. Janmaat? £4.9m. CLICK HERE and start picking now! SO, JANMAAT OR DEBUCHY? Janmaat is designed to replace his French counterpart, but what do the statistics say? Look away Arsenal fans - and don't shoot the messenger - but Janmaat wins in almost every department from last season, according to Squawka, who kindly did the math. Looking at everything from passing to tackling to chances created, Janmaat scores 23.38 points compared to Debuchy's 14.69. He also wins in the defensive market - 9.87 to 8.99. Janmaat completed an average of 38.20 passes per match with an 82 per cent success rate - Debuchy made just 25.14 passes with 73 per cent finding their destination. Assists? Five to three. Minutes on the pitch? 2,644 to 2,491. Debuchy does win the occasional battle, though. The former Newcastle defender wins in tackles by the skin of his teeth - 2.45 to 2.20. But, in doing so, he commits more fouls - 1.41 to 0.83. Make of these what you will, but Janmaat looks the safer bet on paper. Tackle: Janmaat (left) is not afraid to make a challenge and is eager to add to the attacking element of teams . Why pay top dollar for an overly-expensive defender when you can get Janmaat for less than £5m? 1. £7m - V Kompany, Manchester City . 2. £6.9m - B Ivanovic, Chelsea . 3. £6.8m - J Terry, Chelsea . 4. £6.7m - P Metresacker, Arsenal . 5. £6.6m - P Zabaleta, Manchester City . 53. £4.9m - D Janmaat, Newcastle United . BUT HOW WILL HE GET YOU POINTS? Janmaat, a rare breed of a defender, loves to get forward while also fulfilling his duties at the back. Not only will he get you those appearances and clean-sheet points, the Dutchman will chip in with the occasional goal and assist too. Last season, Janmaat scored twice (that would be 10 points apiece in Sportsmail's Fantasy Football game) and nabbed five assists (three apiece). Not a bad return for a full-back. It appears the ex-Feyenoord star has been given licence to do the same at Newcastle by Pardew, so do you fancy a gamble on the attacking full-back that costs just £4.9m? SO, WHO WOULD COST YOU MORE? Take your pick. Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne, Stoke's Erik Pieters and Everton's Sylvain Distin all cost more than Janmaat. In the list of defenders by price, Janmaat falls 51st. Can you afford not to pick him as a substitute? Going Dutch: Janmaat played five times at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil for Holland under Louis van Gaal . IS HE EXPERIENCED ENOUGH FOR THE PREMIER LEAGUE? Judging by Brazil 2014, he is. Janmaat had to rise through the ranks to earn that orange shirt, and did so impressively. Van Gaal isn't the easiest man to please after all. Not to mention, he's confident. Janmaat describes his transfer to Newcastle as the 'perfect move'. The right-back, having also been linked with Juventus, Arsenal and Manchester United in the past, shows no signs of weaknesses yet. He's there to bridge a gap, and should do so fittingly. CLICK HERE TO START PICKING JANMAAT FOR YOUR TEAM! YOU'RE NOT TOO LATE! Step-up?

"There are between 20 and 30 cars that make up the official motorcade of the President of the United States - a security procession that travels, usually at high speeds and with green-light corridors, with the commander-in-chief  everywhere he goes. A 24-year-old California student has now revealed how she was selected as one of many volunteer drivers to be part of that chain of vehicles, 'following Obama all over San Francisco' for a day - despite having no experience, no training and, in what experts have called the most troubling, no idea what to do in an emergency. Natalie Tyson even read a college textbook while waiting for the convoy to get back on the road, and posted pictures to her Facebook of the October experience, one of which was captioned: 'Me, wondering why anyone would trust me with a 15-passenger van full of reporters.' 'Me with the President's car': Bay Area student Natalie Tyson spent a day as part of the President's motorcade in San Francisco, but admits to having no experience or training . Snap happy: Tyson, a graduate student, volunteered for the job after being offered it by a friend, and documented the experience with a series of photos on Facebook, such as this one . Selfie: This photo was captioned with 'Me, wondering why anyone would trust me with a 15-passenger van full of reporters' 'You know how sometimes you are starting a new job or starting a new course, and you have to come up with three truths and a lie about yourself?” Tyson told The New York Times in a new feature. 'This will be my truth that sounds like a lie.' The motorcade is centrally comprised of a Secret Service detail guarding the President, local police as assistance and an ambulance - which remains at the rear with a doctor permanently on board. However, there are also 'filler' cars in the middle carrying White House personnel, communications staff  and reporters, all of whom travel with the president. Tyson said that one week before President Obama arrived in San Francisco on October 10, a friend who works at the White House texted her asking if she would be willing to drive a van full of reporters as part of the procession. She told him she had never driven a van, but had driven a pick-up truck. She also said she had a clean driving record, no criminal history and would be willing to take on the job. A week later she was on the tarmac at San Francisco International Airport waiting for Air Force One to touch down. Touch down: President Barack Obama arrives at San Francisco International airport on Friday October 10, 2014, to attend fundraising events . When pressed by The Times on how she would handle an incident such as an attack, Tyson admitted she received little-to-no briefing from the Secret Service before getting behind the wheel of the official van. She said the main warning was not to hit any police motorcycles, usually driven by local officers. Tyson also said that, in the event of an emergency, she would just follow the car in front of her. 'Whatever I am is good enough for them,' Tyson told the newspaper. In practice, the President travels in a line of vehicles that is referred to as the 'secure package'. Secret Service agents are trained to pull the secure package out of the motorcade during an emergency. They would separate from the group and get the President to safety, leaving the other cars behind. However, having a novice involved in any part of the motorcade poses serious security issues, according to former Secret Service agent Dan Emmett. Agents of (blue) steel: Here Tyson poses with two Secret Service agents, who she described as friendly . Escort: This photo was captioned with 'Zoomed through the empty streets. People waved and took my picture but I don't think they realized that I'm just me' 'Drove out onto the tarmac at SFO to greet Air Force One,' Tyson wrote with this photo . Emmett, author of Within Arm’s Length: A Secret Service Agent’s Definitive Inside Account of Protecting the President, served as agent between 1983 and 2004. 'If the motorcade ever comes under fire, it’s going to be a problem,' he told The Times. 'There are so many non-law-enforcement vehicles that it’s going to be a goat rope. 'Everyone will be responding, police officers and the Secret Service, and it will be all these people running around in a panic like the last scene of the ‘Blues Brothers’ movie, when there’s the big police chase that ends in a wreck of 50 police cars.' Emmett said he used to work as part of the motorcade and the cars being driven by volunteers - something that has been commonplace since the 1980s - were often more problematic than the risk of a skirmish. 'You are face to face with a young person who is just completely full of themselves and enthralled,' Emmett said. 'We were more concerned with that than an attack on the motorcade.' 'Number one thing they told us was not to hit any motorcycle cops. I mean, among other things,' Tyson posted . Tyson said she remained committed to her driving and the motorcade throughout the entire day. But between official visits and press conferences, there was plenty of time to take photos and read her textbook. 1902 - Secret Service agent struck and killed by trolley car in Lenox, Massachusetts, while serving in President Theodore Roosevelt's detail . 1928 - Police motorcycle escort to a presidential candidate struck and killed in Kearny, New Jersey . 1929 - Virginia State Police officer dies after a motorcycle crash escorting President Calvin Coolidge . 1992 - Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputy dies in motorcycle accident while escorting Senator Paul Tsongas, a presidential candidate . 2006 - Honolulu Police officer dies after his motorcycle slides on a rain-slicked roadway, where he was escorting President George W.

Source: Associated Press . One of her photos, showing Tyson standing in front of Obama's official car, was captioned: 'The president's limo! But he wasn't in there yet, that's why they let me take the picture.' Another, taken of the van's side mirror, was captioned: 'Zoomed through the empty streets. People waved and took my picture but I don't think they realized that I'm just me.' A shot of some parked police motorcycles said: 'Number one thing they told us was not to hit any motorcycle cops. I mean, among other things.' A final photo with some Secret Service agents said: 'The secret service was surprisingly nice. One guy had to direct me on backing the van into a parking spot - I don't think he realized his job was going to be so hard when he signed up.' Afterwards, Tyson had the opportunity to meet Obama and take a quick photo. She said his hands were 'so soft' and that he told her and some other volunteers they were 'the best drivers in San Francisco'. 'But I think the reporters in my van might say otherwise,' Tyson wrote on Facebook. Obama was in San Francisco at the time raising campaign money for fellow democrats. The White House would not comment on the practice of enlisting volunteers for the official motorcade, according to The Times. A week before Tyson's involvement, a car accompanying the motorcade for Vice President Joe collided with a police motorcycle in San Francisco, causing damage to the bike but not the officer, The Wall Street Journal reported. It is not known whether the car was being driven by a volunteer. That was not the first incident for a Presidential motorcade. Killed: Jupiter police officer Bruce St. Laurent, a 20-year veteran of the force, was killed in September 2012 when his motorcycle was struck during President Barack Obama's motorcade . Most recently - in September 2012 - a police officer riding with Obama's convoy in Jupiter, Florida, was killed when his motorcycle was struck while riding with the motorcade. A look at the history of accidents in the motorcades shows it is predominantly officers on motorcycles that have died. In this case, the officer - Bruce St. Laurent, a 20-year veteran -  was reportedly hit by Ford F-150 pickup. No further information about the car or driver was released. Earlier, in February 2008, Dallas police officer Victor Lozada was killed while participating in the motorcade of Hillary Clinton, who at the time was seeking the Democratic nomination for the presidency and was not yet U.S. Secretary of State. Scene: Dallas officer Victor Lozada was killed when participating in the motorcade of Hillary Clinton in February 2008, when she was seeking Democratic nomination for presidency . Dead: The family of Victor Lozada argued in a 2010 that he should not have taken part in the motorcade because he had not properly finished his motorcycle training . Lozada tried to overtake part of the motorcade, in what officials called a 'leapfrog' maneuver, when he ran into a sidewalk and slammed head-on into a concrete outcropping. In 2010 Lozada's family sued Clinton and the city of Dallas, saying he was not properly trained to take part in the job. According to The Dallas Morning News, Lozada's motorcycle trainer, Senior Cpl. Dale Erves, wrote that he did not think Lozada was ready to ride on duty, less than one month before the officer's death. A January 25, 2008, daily observation report, signed by Lozada and Erves, states that Lozada had made 'so many mistakes' that Erves was scared of how he would perform on-duty. Lozada had failed that phase of training and needed at least two more weeks of training, the report said.","Graduate student Natalie Tyson, 24, was a volunteer driver for the President's motorcade during a visit to San Francisco on October 10 .

"West Brom head coach Alan Irvine has left the door open for record-signing Brown Ideye after he axed the £10million man. The striker was left out of the squad for the 1-0 win at Leicester on Saturday and has so far struggled for form and fitness. He has netted once since his record-breaking Baggies move from Dynamo Kiev in the summer, in the 3-2 Capital One Cup win over Hull in September. Brown Ideye was left out of last weekend's West Brom squad by Baggies boss Alan Irvine . The Nigeria international picked up an ankle injury in the process but has since recovered and Irvine is happy to speak to Ideye if the forward so wishes. Irvine said: 'The way that we do it is I say to any player 'If you want to come in on Monday, come in on Monday'. 'But when the team's named and the subs are named they have to accept that, respect the rest of the players and then come back in later if they want to have a chat. 'I might have a chat with him if he feels he needs to have a chat, but if he doesn't then I won't be calling him in.' Ideye has made just two starts in the Premier League since his record move from Dynamo Kiev . Ideye has made just two starts in the Barclays Premier League this season and has made little impact at The Hawthorns. Irvine said his omission was purely for tactical reasons as he picked Victor Anichebe and Georgios Samaras on the bench at the King Power Stadium. 'I haven't had a chat with him. We pick the team carefully even if it's the same team. It's still chosen with a lot of thought and care - that applies to the subs as well,' he told the Wolverhampton Express & Star. The West Brom players celebrate Esteban Cambiasso's own goal against Leciester City on Saturday . 'What we knew was that Leicester had a physical presence. Generally, I have two centre-forwards on the bench. 'I decided that I needed physical options there rather than somebody like Brown - whose strengths are running in behind. That's why I went for Victor and Sami (Samaras).'","Alan Irvine leaves door open for Brown Ideye following squad axe .

"While the rest of the royal family braved the cold as they headed to church yesterday morning, Zara Phillips was enjoying Christmas weather of a very different kind. The 33-year-old royal was all smiles as she joined sailing fans in sunny Sydney to wave off boats taking part in the Sydney to Hobart 2014 - one of the toughest yacht races in the world. Resplendent in a pair of navy shorts and a matching polo shirt, Zara looked tanned and happy as she strolled around the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia with its president, Commodore John Cameron. Scroll down for video . Enjoying the sunshine: Zara was in Sydney to wave off competitors taking part in the Sydney to Hobart 2014 race . But although she clutched a cuddly toy seal, Zara's baby daughter Mia were nowhere to be seen. Husband Mike Tindall, 36, was there however and joined his wife on  main sponsor Rolex's viewing yacht. The mother-of-one is in Sydney ahead of the Jeep Magic Millions race meeting which kicks off on the Gold Coast on the 10th January. Patron of Racing Women, an initiative that aims to boost ownership of racehorses among women, Zara first became involved with the race in 2013. As in 2013, she will present the winner of the Racing Women bonus prize with a cheque for $500,000 (£260,000) and a trophy but has missed having a traditional family Christmas to be there. Like the rest of the royal family, Zara usually spends the festive season at Sandringham with the Queen  but instead chose to fly to Australia early for what is the country's fourth royal visit in less than a year. Looking good: Zara looked tanned and happy as she took in the action at the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia . Present for Mia? The 33-year-old was clutching a small stuffed toy seal as she wandered around the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia . Royal visit: Zara's trip to Australia is the fourth by a member of the royal family in less than a year . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George were the first to visit Australia and New Zealand when they travelled to the two countries in April this year. Next came the Princess Royal in October, who spent most of her trip in Brisbane at an agricultural conference before taking part in charity events on behalf of Riding for the Disabled and Save the Children. She was followed to Australia a month later by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, who was there to mark the 50th year of Australian participation in the Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme. The initiative, which was set up by Prince Philip, encourages school children to take part in camping expeditions, as well as doing community and charity work. Family affair: Zara's mother, the Princess Royal, visited Australia in October but spent most of her visit in Brisbane . Enjoying herself: Zara is a keen sailing fan and took part in a charity race during Cowes Week on the Isle of Wight in August . Although Zara has no royal title, she proved a hit with the crowds at the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia. Joined by Australian celebrities, among them Olympic swimmer Geoff Huegill,  she helped wave off 117 yachts - all of whom are battling it out to take first prize in what has been described as the world's 'most testing race'. Stretching 628 nautical miles (722 miles) from Sydney to Hobart in Tasmania, the route takes in the Bass Strait, which is regarded as one of the most perilous waterways in the world. Twice as wide and twice as rough as the English Channel, the Strait is famous for shipwrecks and was the scene of six deaths during the 1998 race following a storm. On her own: Zara's husband Mike Tindall and baby daughter Mia were nowhere to be seen . Engagement: Zara is in Australia ahead of the Mega Millions race day on the 10th January . Ready to go: The crew of the Perpetual LOYAL included boxer Danny Green, Olympic sailor Tom Slingsby and chef Guillaume Brahimi . Saying farewell: The crew say their goodbyes as they prepare to leave the Rose Bay Marina ahead of the race . Stars: The Perpetual LOYAL is crewed entirely by celebrity 'supersailors' including former rugby player Phi Waugh and surfer Sally Fitzgibbons . Celebrity sailing fans: Former Rugby League player Anthony Minichiello (left) chats to Olympic swimmer Geoff Huegill (right) Although Zara is not taking part in the race, she is a keen sailing fan and joined sailors for the Artemis Challenge, a 50-mile charity race around the Isle of Wight, last August. Part of the annual Cowes Week, the race takes competitors on a circuit of the island with winners taking a £10,000 prize to donate to the charity of their choice. Although Zara's yacht failed to win, she did enjoy the day and described the experience as 'absolutely beautiful'. 'We had a great time out there,' she said after the race. 'It was an absolutely beautiful day to be out on the water and I really enjoyed the action at the start. 'It was a good race, it would have been great to have a bit more wind but I’m really pleased we got to go round the Island. The Artemis Challenge is an event I enjoy every time I do it.' Leading the field: The USA's Comanche raced away from the start and was still leading the field 12 hours into the race . Challenger: Behind the Comanche was Wild Oats XI (left) which is crewed by a team from New South Wales, Australia .

"The driver of an armored delivery truck found emptied and abandoned on Monday in Texas has been arrested in Colorado. Trent Cook, 24, of Amarillo, and a second white male were busted in Colorado Springs on Wednesday afternoon. The name of the second suspect was not released. ‘Investigators have confirmed that money believed to have been taken in the theft has been recovered,’ said Amarillo police in a statement. Armored truck driver Trent Cook, 24, (left) has been arrested and charged with first-degree felony theft, while his father, Brian Hodge, 43, (right) has been arrested for allegedly being involved in the heist . Cook has been charged with first-degree felony theft of over $200,000, reports ABC News. Cook's father, Brian Hodge, 43, was arrested on Monday evening for tampering with or fabricating evidence in connection with the case. Police found the Rochester Armored Car Co. vehicle at around 7:50 a.m. on Monday, after receiving a call that it was standing unoccupied. The vehicle was assigned to make rounds filling ATM machines with cash. ‘There was no sign of a struggle or forced entry into the vehicle,’ police said, adding that ‘investigators have information that the suspect had discussed how a theft like this would be committed.’ Authorities have not revealed the contents of the vehicle. Cook was being held at the El Paso County, Colorado jail, pending extradition to Texas. Emptied: On Monday, authorities found this Rochester Armored Car Co. abandoned with its contents stolen; Cook, the driver, was nowhere to be found . He was apprehended at a local hotel based on information provided by the Amarillo police. When authorities found the abandoned vehicle  around 7.50 a.m. in a vacant lot, the Amarillo Police Department listed Cook as a 'missing/endangered person,' but later, investigators said they had reason to believe Cook was involved in the heist. 'Investigators have developed credible evidence Cook has access to a rifle and handguns, and could be considered dangerous due to this information,' the department said in a statement while they were still searching for Cook. On Tuesday, police issued the warrant for Cook and arrested Hodge who, they say, tampered with or fabricated evidence involving the case. Family: Cook's mother (left) and stepfather, Bill Wills (right) maintained that if Cook was involved in any crime involving the vehicle, he must have been forced to participate against his will . Abandoned: On Monday, police found the armored company vehicle abandoned with its contents emptied nearly 30 minutes after the truck went missing . Cook's family had claimed he wasn't voluntarily involved in the heist. They said if he did have anything to do with it, it would have been against his will. But, investigators uncovered that Cook had discussed with others how a heist like this could be pulled off, according to Fox News. On Tuesday evening, authorities even found a white 1995 Ford van in a parking lot which they believe was Cook's getaway vehicle. 'This recovery indicates that the suspect changed cars in the area early in the day, possibly shortly after the theft,' the department said in a statement, according to Fox. 'It is unknown if he was picked up by another person or if the suspect had pre-positioned a second vehicle at that scene.' Getaway vehicle: Authorities found a white 1995 Ford van abandoned in a parking lot which they say they believe was Cook's (photographed) getaway vehicle . Cook is a former reservist of the U.S. Army who had recently quit his job at an Amarillo correctional facility to work for the Rochester Armored Car Company . Bill Wills, Cook's stepfather told the Huffington Post that his son is a former reservist with the U.S. Army and recently quit his job at an Amarillo correctional facility to work for the armored car company. The family told ABC that Cook loved his job and had nothing to do with the crime. Cook was not armed and authorities believe he was the only employee in the truck at the time.","Trent Cook, 24, has been arrested and charged with first-degree felony theft of more than $200,000 .

"A home intruder was given the gift of lead when a California homeowner shot the man he found in his home early Christmas morning. Nathaniel Blair of Anaheim Hills had just exchanged presents with his wife and gone out to move his truck when he encountered a man in a ski mask inside his home. 'I opened the door and was like, is this happening right now?' he told NBC. At home: Nathaniel Blair pursued and shot Jeremy William Bell, 29, pictured in this still fromOnScene.TV, who struck him with a wrench and fled . The intruder, who police later identified as 29-year-old Jeremy William Bell, attacked Blair with a large wrench before trying to escape on foot. 'At that point in time, I'm like, you know what man, you came to the wrong home if you think you're going to come into my house and do that,' Blair said. ABC reports he ran upstairs and locked the door leading to his wife and three-year-old daughter before grabbing his 12-gauge shotgun and pursuing the would-be burglar. 'I had my gun and he tried to round the corner, and I shot him, you know, in the back,' said Blair. 'The resident fired one shot, and struck the suspect who continued to flee on foot,' said Lt Bob Dunn of the Anaheim Police Department. The officers had already responded around 11pm to reports of a man in a ski mask trying to break into a basement window at a nearby home. They returned around 3.30am to search for the man Blair shot. At home: Nathaniel Blair was going out to his truck when he was confronted by the burglar, and shot him once while pursuing . Scrap: The masked man attacked Blair with a large wrench before trying to escape on foot, leading Blair to lock the door to his home and retrieve his shotgun . CBS reports that around 5am, officers located Bell with minor injuries in the garage of a third home with the assistance of bloodhounds and a K9 unit. He was charged with robbery and is being investigated for additional charges in relation to the first report. According to SF Gate, California courts have upheld the right of residents to use force against an assailant inside or outside their home if they have a reasonable fear of injury or death. Rulings include the right 'if reasonably necessary, to pursue an assailant until the danger of death or great bodily injury has passed. This is so even if safety could have been achieved by retreating.'

"President Barack Obama marked the end of more than a decade of combat in Afghanistan by paying tribute to America's military, telling troops on Christmas Day that their sacrifices have allowed for a more peaceful, prosperous world to emerge out of the ashes of 9/11. At an oceanfront Marine Corps base in Hawaii, Obama told troops that while tough challenges remain for the U.S. military in hotspots like Iraq and West Africa, the world as a whole is better off because American troops put country first and served with distinction. He said Americans and their president could not be more thankful. 'Because of the extraordinary service of the men and women in the American armed forces, Afghanistan has a chance to rebuild its own country,' Obama said to applause from Marines and their families. 'We are safer. It's not going to be a source of terrorist attacks again.' Scroll down for video . 'Merry Christmas everybody!': President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama use their Christmas address to give thanks to U.S. troops and their families . At an oceanfront Marine Corps base in Hawaii, Obama told troops that while tough challenges remain for the U.S. military in hotspots like Iraq and West Africa, the world as a whole is better off because American troops put country first and served with distinction . In wishing all Americans a Merry Christmas as part of their annual address, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle turned the focus to the sacrifice of U.S. troops and their families, and how the combat mission in Afghanistan would soon be over. 'We're able to gather with family and friends because our troops are willing to hug theirs goodbye and step forward to serve,' Obama said in the speech. 'After a long day, we can come home because they're willing to leave their families and deploy. 'We can celebrate the holidays because they're willing to miss their own,' Obama said. 'And so, as our troops continue to transition back home - back to our businesses, our schools, our congregations, and our communities - it's up to all of us to serve them as well as they have served us.' Obama's visit to the Marine Corps base - where troops and their families had just finished a Christmas dinner of turkey, lobster and candied yams - came midway through his annual family vacation in Hawaii, where the president was spending the holiday unwinding from a turbulent year in Washington. Earlier in the day, Michelle shared a snap of Christmas past. The first lady tweeted a photograph on Thursday afternoon showing her with President Obama in their younger years, with the message: 'Merry Christmas!' In the image, which is not dated, the young couple are standing beside a Christmas tree that is a slightly less impressive than the one at their home today. She shared her message online as she celebrated Christmas day by singing carols and opening gifts with her husband and their daughters at their vacation home in Hawaii. The White House said Obama started the holiday on Christmas Eve by having dinner with friends, his wife and daughters before telephoning troops who are stationed overseas for the holidays. Younger years: Michelle Obama  shared this photo to Twitter on Thursday with the message: 'Merry Christmas!' President Barack Obama, with first lady Michelle Obama, greeted troops and their families on Christmas Day, at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii during the Obama family vacation . In the calls, he thanked the troops for their service and the sacrifice they and their families make. Later on Thursday, as is their tradition, Obama and his wife were planning to visit with troops and their families at a Marine Corps base in Hawaii. On Christmas Eve, White House photographer, Pete Souza, shared another rather festive snap of the commander-in-chief - showing him wearing a jewel-encrusted tiara with a Girl Scouts troop. The image, which was actually taken with the troop from Tulsa, Oklahoma at the annual White House Science Fair in May, was shared by Souza on his Instagram page on Christmas Eve. He explained that he came across the image while editing his images from 2014. ABC News noted that the smiling youngsters managed to get Obama to do something the Navy football team had been unable to do in April - wear a headdress. The Navy had presented Obama with a custom-fit helmet but he refused to try it on. 'Here's the general rule: You don't put stuff on your head if you're president,' Obama said at the time. 'That's politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.' Also on Christmas Eve, the White House shared a photograph of Michelle Obama speaking to children on the phone for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and its super-popular Santa tracking program. Festive: A Girl Scout troop from Tulsa, Oklahoma convinced President Obama to don a tiara during their trip to the White House in May. The image was shared by his official photographer on Christmas Ev . The first couple passed on their good wishes to the country in Obama's weekly address, and called upon the nation to give thought to the troops and their families. The president added that the celebration of the birth of Jesus was a reminder of a message 'that has changed the world: to reach out to the sick; the hungry; the troubled; and above all else, to love one another as we would be loved ourselves.' On Christmas Eve, Mrs Obama had spent the day away from her husband on the fifth day of their traditional Hawaiian getaway so that they could both complete diplomatic duties and be with their daughters on Christmas Day. While his wife was volunteering, the President enjoyed a game of golf with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Obama and Najib teed off Wednesday on a cloudy but balmy afternoon at a Marine Corps base on Oahu, not far from where Obama is renting a home for his two-week stay. The two leaders seemed at ease together, smiling and laughing in casual clothes as they sized up their shots. Although Obama plays golf nearly every day while on vacation, he typically restricts his foursome to a small circle of longtime friends and advisers.

Mixing business and pleasure: US President Barack Obama he plays golf with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razzak at Marine Corps Base Hawaii on Christmas Eve . 'The two leaders took the opportunity to discuss the growing and warming relationship between the United States and Malaysia,' the White House said in a statement . But in recent years, his annual trip to Hawaii has allowed Obama to mix in a little diplomacy. Last year, he hit the links with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who owns a home in Hawaii. Media access to Obama's golf games is typically restricted, but reporters and photographers were permitted to briefly watch the two leaders Wednesday about halfway through their game. Neither leader was having particularly good luck with their short game. Up first to finish the hole, Najib came up short with his putt. Obama crouched low to line up his shot, but the ball tilted left and evaded the hole. After another failed attempt, he picked up the ball and called it quits. Najib, too, missed his next shot, but a gracious Obama gave him a pat on the shoulder and praised his golf game just the same. 'Merry Christmas,' Obama said as he waved to the media. In April, Obama paid the first presidential visit to Malaysia in nearly half a century, when Lyndon B. Johnson visited the Southeast Asian nation . U.S. President Barack Obama puts his putter in the bag after he and Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak played on the 18th green at the Clipper Golf course on Marine Corps Base Hawaii on December 24 . Then he added a note of caution for reporters covering his Hawaiian getaway. 'Be careful about those fruity drinks,' he said. 'You never know - they might have a little kick to them.' Ever the statesmen, Obama and Najib also used their time on the course to discuss world affairs, including Malaysia's rotating leadership next year of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. 'The two leaders took the opportunity to discuss the growing and warming relationship between the United States and Malaysia,' the White House said in a statement. Najib has served as Malaysia's prime minister since 2009. In April, Obama paid the first presidential visit to Malaysia in nearly half a century, when Lyndon B. Johnson visited the Southeast Asian nation. During that visit, Obama met with Najib and pressed his government to improve its human rights and political freedoms. Vacation: President Obama, his wife and daughters Sasha and Malia disembark Air Force One  after arriving at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for their annual family Christmas vacation last Friday . Obama is no stranger to Hawaii's picturesque golf courses, and this year's vacation has been par for the course. The president has played a round four out of the five days he's been on the island so far. Michelle, meanwhile, was busy helping NORAD, which uses the heat signature from Rudolph's nose to 'track' St. Nick over spots ranging from Australia to South America and on to the United States. She volunteers each year. While other volunteers work from an operations center in Colorado, Michelle works remotely from Hawaii each year. She spent 30 minutes answering calls from children. This year, Obama fielded a half-dozen calls while Santa was swooping down in Italy, Kosovo and the Czech Republic. Heartwarming: NORAD volunteers take phone calls from children around the world asking where Santa is and when he will deliver presents to their homes at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado . NORAD and USNORTHCOM Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Charles D. Luckey joins other volunteers taking phone calls  during the annual NORAD Tracks Santa Operation . 'Do you believe in Santa?' asked Sara, an 8-year-old from Ontario, Canada. Mrs. Obama replied that she did ? and the president does, too. 'That's why I try to be good all year. I try to help other people and eat my vegetables, and be kind to all the kids that I know because I believe that Santa is watching,' the first lady said. Kids can call 877-HI-NORAD or email noradtrackssanta@outlook.com on Christmas Eve and an operator will tell them exactly where Santa is based on their tracking system. The program is based at a control center at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. Last year the website received 19.5 million hits, while volunteers fielded 117,000 phone calls and answered 9,600 emails. The website was launched in 1997.

"An ancient fresh water lake on Mars could have sustained life on the red planet billions of years ago. Mudstones from Gale Crater, the landing site of the Curiosity rover, were formed in a lake that may have existed on the planet for hundreds of thousands of years, say scientists. The 150 kilometre-wide (93-mile) impact basin, with a mountain at its centre, is believed to have supported the lake - and possibly more than one - around 3.6 billion years ago. Scroll down for video... The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This is an artist's impression of what a lake on Mars may have looked like . The analysis showed that the lake was . calm and likely had fresh water, containing key biological elements including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. Such a lake would provide perfect conditions for simple microbial life such as chemolithoautotrophs to thrive in. On Earth, chemolithoautotrophs are commonly found in caves and around hydrothermal vents. The microbes break down rocks and minerals for energy. Mudstones generally form in calm conditions. They are created by very fine sediment grains settling layer-by-layer on each other in still water. The finding was made by a team of researchers from Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover mission, which includes a member from Imperial College London. Pictured is the Curiosity Rover that analysed the area . The team's analysis showed that the lake was calm and likely had fresh water, containing key biological elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur . Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived on Mars in 1971. Mariner 9 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometres. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past. In June this year, Curiosity rover found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. The finding was made by a team of researchers from Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity Rover mission, which includes a member from Imperial College London. The mudrocks were at a site named Yellowknife Bay in Gale Crater, near the Martian equator. These revealed that Gale Crater, a 150km wide impact basin with a mountain at its center, sustained at least one lake around 3.6 billion years ago. Professor Sanjeev Gupta, a member of the MSL mission at Imperial College London said: 'It is important to note that we have not found signs of ancient life on Mars. 'What we have found is that Gale Crater was able to sustain a lake on its surface at least once in its ancient past that may have been favourable for microbial life, billions of years ago. 'This is a huge positive step for the exploration of Mars. 'It is exciting to think that billions of years ago, ancient microbial life may have existed in the lake's calm waters, converting a rich array of elements into energy. 'The next phase of the mission, where we will be exploring more rocky outcrops on the crater's surface, could hold the key whether life did exist on the red planet.' In previous studies, Professor Gupta and the MSL team have found evidence of water on Mars' surface in other rocks such as conglomerates. However, the new research provides the strongest evidence yet that Mars could have been habitable enough for life to take hold. The team analysed the geology and chemistry of the mudstones by drilling into the rock using the MSL six-wheeled science laboratory, which is remotely operated by the MSL team from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena in the USA. The next step will see the team using the rover to explore Gale Crater for further evidence of ancient lakes or other habitable environments in the thick pile of sedimentary rocks scattered across the crater's surface. The findings are published in the journal Science. The Mars rover Curiosity drilled into this rock target, 'Cumberland,' during the 279th Martian day. Analysis such as this helped discover that a fresh water lake existed on Mars billions of years ago .","Evidence of lake came from rocks in Gale Crater near the Martian equator .

"Elvin Payamps of Queens allegedly told a friend that he wished the two cops assassinated in Brooklyn on Saturday had been white . A New York man has been arrested and charged after he was overheard talking on his cell phone about wanting to murder two white NYPD officers. Elvin Payamps of Queens allegedly told a friend that he wished the two cops assassinated in Brooklyn on Saturday - Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu - had been white. Payamps was heard vowing to make it right by shooting more officers, as he stood in a TD Bank branch on Wednesday lunchtime. Unbeknownst to Payamps, 38, his threats were overheard ex-NYPD officer Charles Otero who was stood nearby, reports the New York Post. 'I'm going to kill another cop. We should do it before Christmas. The cop should have been white that was killed. I always have a gun on me,' he is alleged to have said. Otero called 911, and Payamps was later stopped by the police. He was found to have marijuana on his person and was taken into custody. Police then searched his home, which was less than a mile from the Christ Tabernacle Church where  Rafael Ramos' funeral will be held on Saturday. At Payamps's house, officers found a Jimenez Arms 9mm pistol and a Mossberg Maverick 12-gauge shotgun with defaced serial numbers, as well as two bulletproof vests and brass knuckles. Payamps allegedly confessed to stealing one of the vests from the Brooklyn Detention Center and to making the threat against officers. He was ordered held in lieu of $500,000 bail on Thursday night on felony weapons charges, along with charges of felony aggravated harassment, unlawful use of a police uniform and pot possession. 'The case is serious,' said Queens Criminal Court Judge Stephanie Zaro. 'But the law does not allow me to remand on a C violent felony,' she said, in reference to the weapons charge. NYPD officers found a Jimenez Arms 9-mm firearm and a Mossberg Maverick 12-gauge shotgun with defaced serial numbers, as well as two bulletproof vests and brass knuckles at Payamps' Queens home .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has hinted further that Frank Lampard is still likely to be in his squad next month. Former England midfielder Lampard has made a big impact at the Etihad Stadium since signing on loan from sister club New York City and is expected to extend his stay with the English champions. The 36-year-old's initial spell is due to expire at the end of this month but Pellegrini has made clear his desire to keep the player. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has hinted Frank Lampard is still likely to be in his squad next month . Lampard (right) in training with Yaya Toure (left) and he could extend his stay in the Premier League . 'One of the reasons we asked him to play here was because we knew Yaya would be leaving us to go to the African Cup of Nations,' Manchester City manager Pellegrini admits . Lampard has also indicated a willingness to stay and Pellegrini said earlier this week that he expected a decision within the 'next days'. Now the Chilean has revealed that having Lampard as potential cover for Yaya Toure during the African Nations Cup, which starts on January 17, was always part of the plan. 'One of the reasons we asked him to play here was because we knew Yaya would be leaving us to go to the African Cup of Nations,' Pellegrini said. It remains to be seen, however, whether Pellegrini will get his wish for Lampard to stay until the end of the season. The former Chelsea midfielder is a key part of City's bold strategy in New York and Pellegrini's American counterparts want him available for the start of the Major League Soccer season in March. Negotiations are therefore not straightforward and appear to be taking time, but Pellegrini claims any perceived delay is not an issue. He said: 'The reason (it is taking so long) is not important - the important thing is that he stays here. Yes I'm confident he'll stay but I can't say 100 per cent because it doesn't depend just on me. 'It's not so easy because Frank is a New York City player. He's only on loan until December so we must respect the other people.' Lampard is on loan from New York City  but Manchester City want him to stay beyond January . Toure is likely to join up with his Ivory Coast team-mates for the African Nations Cup after the FA Cup third-round tie against Sheffield Wednesday on January 4. Ivory Coast play their first match at the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, which ends with the final on February 8, on January 20. Toure was missed during the tournaments of 2012 and 2013 and that is likely to be the case again as he starts to find form after a difficult start to the season. But Pellegrini has no complaints about the situation having long known it was a possibility. He said: 'We are not exactly sure of the dates. I think he will play in the FA Cup and then go in the second week of January. 'I think with every club, you know at the start of the season what will happen. You can prepare the season knowing those things and you can do it in the way you think is best. 'Am I happy? No. You always want to retain the best players here but you know he must go. The rules are the rules.' Toure (right) is likely to join up with his Ivory Coast team-mates after the FA Cup third-round tie on January 4 . Another player likely to be missing for most of January is top scorer Sergio Aguero, who suffered a knee injury in the defeat of Everton on December 6. Pellegrini hopes the Argentina striker will be back for the crucial clash with title rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on January 31. He said: 'He'll be back as soon as we hoped. I hope by the end of January he'll be fit.' Chelsea lead the Barclays Premier League by three points from City ahead of the Boxing Day fixtures. With the Londoners also still in contention in the Champions League and Capital One Cup - and with their FA Cup challenge to begin in January - midfielder Nemanja Matic has spoken of the possibility of winning a quadruple. City were in a similar position at the same stage last year but eventually had to settle for two trophies. Pellegrini said: 'We tried last year and we couldn't do it, for different reasons. Particularly in the FA Cup we made mistakes, losing at home against Wigan. 'It's always possible - difficult, but possible.' As for whether Chelsea might achieve such an unprecedented feat, Pellegrini is not interested. 'I don't analyse Chelsea,' he said. 'I will start thinking about them the last week before we play them on January 31.'","Manuel Pellegrini admits keeping Frank Lampard as cover was the plan .

"Deposed: Mohammah Mossadegh was removed as Iran's prime minister in a CIA coup whose details have just been revealed for the first time . Today marks the 60th anniversary of the coup in Iran which deposed prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh after he restricted the flow of oil to the West. However, it is only now, six decades on, that the CIA has finally admitted that it was behind the revolution, which was one of the most significant landmarks in modern Iranian history. It has long been widely acknowledged that the U.S. and British authorities were behind Mossadegh's overthrow - one factor behind the anti-Western sentiments shared by many in Iran which led to the 1979 Islamist revolution in the country. However, the CIA has never publicised . its role in the operation, claiming that it needs to maintain secrecy . in order to protect its working methods and sources of information. But today the agency released documents to the National Security Archive in which it admits that the coup 'was carried out under CIA direction as an act of U.S. foreign policy'. The . operation, codenamed 'TPAJAX', was 'conceived and approved at the . highest levels of government', the documents - entitled 'The Battle for . Iran' and compiled in the 1970s - reveal. The . agency admits that the coup, which saw the Shah persuaded to sack . Mossadegh and replace him with Fazlollah Zahedi, was a 'last resort' and . a 'policy of desperation'. It took place on August 19, 1953, after negotiations between Britain and Iran over securing UK access to Iranian oil broke down. Populist: Mossadegh alienated the West by nationalising Iran's oil supplies which were controlled by Britain . MI6 . is thought to have asked the CIA to remove Mossadegh and install a . pro-Western leader, and the U.S. authorities readily agreed as a way of . getting the upper hand over the Soviets in the Cold War. The . internal dossier says: 'It was the potential of those risks to leave . Iran open to Soviet aggression that compelled the United States in . planning and executing TPAJAX.' One . alternative possibility was a unilateral invasion of Iran by British . forces, similar to the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt during the Suez . crisis three years later. However, . that prospect was apparently unacceptable to the U.S., as it would lead . to a Soviet backlash and the West would permanently lose access to . Iran's oil supply. Coup: Soldiers and tanks stand in the streets of Tehran after the deposition of Mossadegh in August 1953 . Historic: The coup led to a strong anti-Western legacy in Iran, culminating in the 1979 Islamic revolution . Mohammed Mossadegh was elected as prime minister of Iran in April 1951, and quickly set about opposing the British authorities who had long dominated the Middle Eastern country. Around the time he came to power, the Iranian parliament voted to nationalise the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, taking the country's oil supply into its own hands. Britain fiercely opposed this move, and opted to blockade Iran in order to prevent it from selling its oil to anyone else. This put severe strain on the national finances, but the fiercely patriotic Mossadegh refused to back down and set about shoring up his power. The CIA and MI6 managed to persuade the Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, to support Fazlollah Zahedi as a replacement prime minister at the head of a military junta. They orchestrated street protests and arranged a national propaganda campaign which led to Mossadegh's downfall on August 19, 1953. The deposed leader was sentenced to three years in prison, then spent the rest of his life under house arrest before dying in 1967. The Shah, emboldened by his newfound power, became an autocratic leader who ruled the country with an iron fist until his downfall in the Islamic revolution. 'The Soviet army would have moved south to drive British forces out on behalf of their Iranian ""allies"",' the CIA documents say. 'Then not only would Iran's oil have been irretrievably lost to the West, but the defence chain around the Soviet Union which was part of U.S. foreign policy would have been breached.' They continue: 'Under such circumstances, the danger of a third world war seemed very real.' Although the coup was extremely successful in the short term, with Mossadegh being swiftly removed and imprisoned, its long-term effects were less positive. The U.S. intervention in Iran's . internal politics created a strong strain of anti-American sentiment in . the country, which culminated in the hostage crisis following the . Islamic revolution of 1979. The . UK's involvement in the coup - which has never been officially . recognised - also created a backlash within Iran, with many regarding . Britain with even more hostility than they do the U.S. The . newly released CIA documents acknowledge these ill effects, stating the . the coup is regarded by many observers as being 'near the top of their . list of infamous Agency acts'. While . the CIA itself has never previously alluded to its role in carrying out . the coup, officials as senior as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have . acknowledged that the operation had U.S. backing. It is unclear why intelligence chiefs have now decided to own up to the true origins of the coup.

"Harry Redknapp believes QPR striker Charlie Austin will find the consistency needed to avoid becoming a one-season wonder. Austin, a £4million signing from Burnley in 2013, is the highest-scoring Englishman in the Barclays Premier League this season with 11 goals in 15 appearances and will be the Hoops' main threat in the Boxing Day showdown at Arsenal. Redknapp is delighted with the 25-year-old's immediate acclimatisation to the top flight and is confident he will not fade. Charlie Austin rises highest to score against West Brom in QPR's last Premier League match . Austin's hat-trick against West Brom took him to 11 league goals for the season, the most by an Englishman . 'I think he will show the consistency he needs. He's mobile, he runs, he's a handful and is improving all the time. He's scored some great goals in training too,' Redknapp said. 'You can see the confidence in him now. For sure I see him doing it for more than one season. 'He's a smashing lad. If you had a club full of Charlie Austins, it would be an easy job as manager. He gets on with it and there are no problems. 'It's just the way he is, he's just a good lad. There's no one you'd want to be successful more than Charlie, he's a good person.'

Redknapp believes England selection is a possibility for Austin, but insists the former Swindon hitman is a entering a key period as he seeks recognition by Roy Hodgson. 'There are three months until the next England game and he's got to keep doing it for the next three months,' Redknapp said. 'Three months is a long time in football. If he can keep performing in these three months anything can happen for him. But that's a long way off.'

"It started as a controversial project between estranged countries. But after President Obama's announcement last week, everything changed. On Wednesday, the curtains went up on Cuba's first Broadway musical since 1959, and the actors were celebrating much more than the show's debut. Scroll down for video . Reaching out: On Wednesday, the curtains went up on RENT, Cuba's first Broadway musical since 1959, and the actors were celebrating much more than the show's debut . Anticipation: After applying to put on the Spanish-language version of RENT, it took producers a year to get a response from Cuba . Wild times: The debut of RENT in Havana came just after the surprise announcement by President Obama to normalize relations with the small Caribbean nation . In front of an invitation-only crowd of dignitaries and theater aficionados, a cast of 15 put up the Spanish translation of the hit 90s musical RENT that they had been practicing for the past month. 'We rocked the roof off the theater,' the musical's Cuban-American director Andy Señor Jr told the Miami Herald. It was a production years in the making, with revered producer Bob Nederlander Jr at the helm and Mr Señor Jr, an original cast member, directing. Even after applying to stage the show last fall, it took a year to get a response, Mr Nederlander Jr told DailyMail.com. 'That year was tense,' he said. 'We did have to wait a while and there were times I wasn't sure what would happen. I had this false sense of optimism but they could have said anything.' During the wait, they never imagined the scenes of Wednesday December 17, when the US and Cuba agreed to normalize relations. 'It was a brilliant moment on Wednesday, the announcement was a real, real surprise. Open wounds: The themes explored in RENT about sexuality, poverty, the struggle with AIDS and addictions were still raw in the country . Success: RENT, a modern adaptation of Puccini's La Boheme, replaces 1800s Paris with 1990s New York City, and tuberculosis with AIDS.The original production enjoyed a seven-year run. 'All of the cast and crew were huddled around the television watching their president's speech. 'They are all incredibly happy, incredibly excited. 'The timing really is astounding. We have a front-row seat to see this history unfold. It is incredible.' RENT, a modern adaptation of Puccini's La Boheme, replaces 1800s Paris with 1990s New York City, and tuberculosis with AIDS. The original production enjoyed a seven-year run. Excitement: The producers spoke about the emotion of putting this show on for young Cubans, as the themes and music, they hoped, would connect with the current generation . Dealing: The musical deals heavily with the issue of HIV and AIDS, while the island nation's healthcare system developed to fight the disease has been lauded internationally . Audiences across the US and Europe embraced the struggling film maker, the nightclub dancer, the drag queen; the bisexuality, the drugs, the fight against AIDS. Despite the cultural references - which may fly over the heads of 95 per cent of Cubans who don't have internet - Nederlander insists this is the perfect musical to break the ice. And the directors of Havana's Bertolt Brecht Theater, chosen for its intimate setting, had no objections. 'It is perfect. We wanted to excite a younger audience, and RENT has everything. The music contemporary, and the themes of friendship, love, loss, hate... They're things we can all connect with; things everyone in Havana will connect with.' In fact, many of the show's issues are still open wounds for the Caribbean nation. Cuba did not legalize homosexuality until 1979. However, the nation's battle with AIDS has been as devastating and testing as New York's. And though critics question the Castro brothers' motives, their healthcare system developed to fight the disease has been lauded internationally. The original run on Broadway accrued a following of fans dubbed 'RENTheads' - New Yorkers similar to the embattled characters, who would queue for hours to get their hands on specially discounted tickets. Those tickets would be reserved for the front two rows of the stalls, and cast members frequently gushed about the atmosphere in those rows, . In Havana, all tickets throughout the three-month run will be sold for the equivalent of 50 cents. And in a meta-theatrical twist, the show opens on Christmas Eve with the characters praying they will make it through Christmas. Señor Jr, who played the AIDS-infected transvestite Angel in the original, gave a hint of that atmosphere from the rehearsal room. 'We're making the impossible possible!' he said.","A Spanish-language version of the musical, directed by one of the original cast members, opened Wednesday for an invitation-only performance .

"A psychic who claims to have sex with aliens who sneak into her room while she sleeps appeared on live TV to discuss the 'out-of-this-world orgasms' she has with 'octopus men and cat people'. Stephany Fay Cohen discussed her adult adventures with Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield on today's This Morning, as part of a week of features celebrating the supernatural. Cohen even drew pictures of both the UFO she travels in with her 'spirit guides', and a Grey, one race of alien with whom she interacts. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Before the show, Cohen, left, revealed to Philip Schofield that the sex she has with aliens including the Grey race, right, resulted in 'out-of-this-world orgasms' A drawing, by Stephany Fay Cohen, of the UFO on which she was taken in to space on Tuesday night . Before the show, Cohen had revealed to Philip that the sex she has with aliens resulted in 'out-of-this-world orgasms'. Explaining her story, Cohen said that the aliens sneak into her room at night: 'My group, I call them Team Spirit, we have a UFO, a flying saucer, and we go off to planets within our own solar system but also way out. We go in mind. It happens when my physical body is asleep but my spiritual body travels. Holly then asked: 'Could it be a dream? Isn't that what most people call dreaming?' To which Cohen replied: 'A dream is a friendly way of letting you know what you've been doing without scaring you. That's what they are. Because otherwise people would be afraid if they were face-to-face with an alien.' WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW ON THIS MORNING HERE . Cohen explained that the various types of alien races include the Greys, the reptilians, the cat people and the octopus men, all of whom come from different planets in the Canis Major solar system. She has a particularly close octopus man friend named Ian. She said: 'He stays close to me, kind of like a . spirit boyfriend - but I don't call him my boyfriend, he's more a good . spirit friend who happens to be from the octopus race. 'All of the races indulge in sex, but particularly the cat people are highly-charged sexually - and it's part of our culture.'

The This Morning studio was given a special ethereal makeover for their supernatural special . Supernatural sceptic Professor Chris French appeared alongside Cohen on the programme to contradict her views. He said: 'The oldest question is whether . there is any kind of external proof of this, and I'm not convinced. It's . all happening in Stephany's head, basically, as she admits herself.' Professor French suggested an alternative explanation was that Cohen suffers from Persistent Arousal Disorder, which makes her feel as though she is having sex while asleep. When asked if the aliens were in the studio at present, Cohen explained they were, saying: 'My cat grandmother is sitting on the sofa over there doing her knitting.' Philip Schofield, left, and Holly Willoughby, right, asking questions to Stephany Fay Cohen on This Morning . She elaborated that the aliens didn't appear to everyone because 'they're not into showing off and are quite reserved', and that each person has their own individual guides who manifest themselves to them only.

"Got your juicer ready to start your liquid-only diet or are you set to starve yourself two days a week from January 1st? If it's your New Year's resolution to lose weight and you plan to follow a fad diet in order to do it then you are doomed to fail, according to the author of a new book. Ruth Field believes we would all be fitter and slimmer if instead of cutting carbs, gluten or dairy from our diets, we just cut the cr*p instead. Scroll down for video . Planning a fast? Cut out sugary, high fat indulgences rather than all foods, says the author of a new book . The mother-of-two has written about her common sense approach to dieting in Cut The Cr*p: The No-Nonsense Plan For A Healthy Body And Mind that will be published by Sphere on 15 January. Using her formidable alter-ago, The Grit Doctor, Ruth tells it how it is to give people a reality check on their waistlines. She said the first step for anyone wanting to lose weight is to acknowledge they are fat because of their own lifestyle choices - not because of their genes, their job or their family. The author of a new book has no patience for people who eat  chocolate and  complain about being overweight . She writes: 'Every time you are in a newsagents buying sweets or chocolate because you are starving and desperate for a sugar hit, remember this: someone else slimmer and fitter than you was feeling the same way, yet chose to eat an apple. And then went for a run. 'That is the unpalatable truth that no one is telling you straight. You need to accept that you being overweight is no one's fault but your own.' She adds: 'The reason you are fat is you eat too much cr*p and you don't move enough.' The author: Ruth Field has written Cut The Cr*p to help and inspire people to become healthier . Ruth writes that anyone who seeks salvation for their figure in a faddy diet is fooling themselves - because they won't be able to stick to it. She uses the women she has observed in her local north London coffee shop as an example. 'They discuss their fasting or no carb diets while munching on pastries and sipping lattes. 'Educated interesting women spending their precious time and energy discussing diets while eating cr*p,' she writes. Ruth believes that faddy diets and promises of miracle fixes are 'distracting us from the real issues'. 'The important stuff about food that actually matters: from food labelling to portion sizes, from sugar addiction to our insatiable appetite for processed foods - issues that demand our scrutiny so that we can make better foods choices for ourselves and our increasingly porky children.' Thus in the book, Ruth does not promise miracles or a 'magical elixir juice recipe that is going to answer your prayers'. Instead, she reveals how to make lifestyle choices that will last beyond January so you can become fitter and healthier for life. She explains ways to stay motivated and provides recipes that are healthy but simple to make - and even your children will eat them. She knows as she tested them out on her own four-year-old twins. Be accountable: Ruth said many people have to accept they are overweight because of the choices they have made instead of blaming other factors like their genes or job (posed by model) She said people need to aim for healthier choices 'most of the time' (treating yourself occasionally is fine but bingeing on sugary food every day is not). She said people need to be more educated about what is in the food they eat by becoming vigorous about checking labels for the nutritional content. In particular, caution should be taken when it comes to foods that claim to be healthy because they are low in fat or calories. A quick check of the label could reveal they are high in sugar and salt. Ruth said to lose weight, people should think SAP. S IS FOR SUGAR: Less of it . A IS FOR ACTIVITY: More of it . P IS FOR PROCESSED GOODS: Fewer of these . Ruth is also passionate about encouraging people to exercise more in order to stay fit and healthy. The 39-year-old former criminal barrister took up running herself in her mid-20s after agreeing to do a marathon. She knows from experience that it's not fun at the beginning because you are unfit but that doesn't mean you should quit. 'Everyone hates it until they have practised it religiously for sometime,' she admitted. She added: 'I wouldn't say I enjoy running but I enjoy the benefits that running brings such as getting outdoors and feeling healthier. I certainly didn't enjoy it when I first started. 'I can honestly say I hated every single one of those early runs as they were incredibly difficult and I was out of breath within minutes feeling like I was on the verge of a heart attack.' Everyone has the same 24 hours a day and if President Obama can find time to exercise, you can, says Ruth . She also has a comeback for the other excuses people peddle for not being active, such as 'I don't have time' ('Everyone has the same 24 hours a day, President Obama finds the time and I guarantee he has more to get done in a given day than you do in an entire week'). And 'I don't have the right build for running' ('There's no such thing as the right build. It's an excuse often used by large breasted ladies but I once ran with a double E cup friend who wore two sports bras'). She's previously written the book Run Fat B!tch Run about what's she's learnt about running and how she got fitter. Despite her initial dislike of the activity, she's now made it a part of her life and goes for a jog regularly. She's not currently training for a marathon but running has become a habit - this is what she encourages in her book. Find something that you can do regularly that keeps you active such as running, walking the children to school or going to a twice weekly Zumba class and it will do wonders for your long-term health. Combined with eating less sugary foods and fewer processed goods, you will be slimmer - it's really that simple. Cut The Cr*p: The No-Nonsense Plan For A Healthy Body And Mind will be published by Sphere on 15 January, £12.99 . Despite their best intentions, many people may take up running this New Year and give up by mid-January due to lack of motivation and support. But Jantastic, a new running challenge kicking off on January 5, may be the secret to staying on track. This is an online challenge that's open to everyone of all abilities, with a range of goals. Participants set their own personal activity targets for their fitness, health or performance goals and strive to stick them during January, February and March. Runners can take part individually or as part of a team and every workout logged contributes towards a participant's overall Jantastic score. Participants can also raise money for charity with Macmillan Cancer Support and Virgin Money Giving and also track their activity levels and routes with the sports social network, Strava.

"We have been treated to some cracking Barclays Premier League action this season with some excellent individual performances. Chelsea lead and have been dominant, but only three points separate them and Manchester City. We’re almost half way through as we enter 2015 and here is Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown's Premier League team of the season so far... Goalkeeper . David de Gea (Manchester United) Over the last two years he has been the only Manchester United player performing at the levels you would expect of that club. He has matured, gets more reliable with every game he plays and is now absolutely key to any success they have. David de Gea makes a superb save to deny Mario Balotelli in one of his many excellent displays this season . De Gea has been Manchester United's best player this year, earning them valuable points . Defence . Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton) Clyne’s has been an incredible rise. He has gone from Crystal Palace to Southampton to England and not once looked out of his depth. It will be a job for anyone to replace him in Roy Hodgson’s team. Nathaniel Clyne has developed hugely at Southampton this year, putting in a string of top performances . The Southampton full back's form has earned him an England call-up this season . Gary Cahill (Chelsea) John Terry has been good but Cahill is now Chelsea’s main man in defence. He has learned from his partner but is an excellent defender in his own right. He is strong, committed and one of the key reasons behind Chelsea’s fantastic start. Gary Cahill has been a rock at the back for Chelsea alongside John Terry as they have dominated the league . Vincent Kompany (Manchester City) He has suffered with some injury niggles but Kompany is still a supreme defender. More than that, his qualities as a man are so impressive. He carries himself and his club with dignity and is a class act on and off the pitch. Despite injury problems, Vincent Kompany has shown this season that he is still a top class defender . Leighton Baines (Everton) His team might be struggling for form, but Baines is still my top left back. He put his World Cup disappointment behind him and has attacked with great freedom for Everton this season. Leighton Baines had a poor World Cup but is getting back to his best for Everton despite his club's struggles . Midfield . Eden Hazard (Chelsea) He’s like a boxer you just can’t hit. Hazard is so fast and tricky and he is now dictating games. He decides when he wants to go past defenders — they have no say in the matter. When he is at his best, as he has been so far this season, Eden Hazard is almost unplayable for a defender . Hazard has scored six Premier League goals already this season, and is one of Chelsea's main threats . Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea) I was surprised to see him move to Chelsea, but he has been sensational. There is a great simplicity to his passing game and he is playing the best football of his career. Even after time at Barcelona, this team give him the best options he’s ever had. Cesc Fabregas is enjoying life at Chelsea, conducting things from midfield with options all around him . Nemanja Matic (Chelsea) Matic perfectly understands his role in this Chelsea team. He is good in possession but knows the value of getting back to slam the door shut. His defensive platform allows Chelsea’s attackers to do what they do best. Sitting in front of Chelsea's back four, Nemanja Matic gives his team-mates the platform to build from . Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) When he plays on the left, the picture is clearer for him — he cuts inside so well and his work-rate is infectious. With that he has great quality and has scored important goals. Since joining from Barcelona, Alexis Sanchez has fast become Arsenal's most important attacking player . Strikers . Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) Shifts direction in an instant and his change of pace leaves defenders for dead. He is strong, level-headed and shows perfect balance, physically and mentally. Just behind Costa he would be unstoppable. Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring at the Etihad - the striker has been prolific this season for Manchester City . Diego Costa (Chelsea) A brute of a striker. He doesn’t stand and wait to be kicked — he makes sure he kicks defenders first. He lays down Costa’s law and has adapted perfectly to English football. Since arriving from Atletico Madrid, Diego Costa has been something of a goal machine . Costa has netted twelve times in the Premier League since joining Chelsea at the beginning of the season . Manager . Jose Mourinho (Chelsea) Selling David Luiz for £50million is enough to win manager of the year! He saw weaknesses in his team and fixed them in the transfer window. Perhaps the only blip was letting go of Frank Lampard. Will he come back to haunt Jose? Jose Mourinho has put together a strong side with good transfer dealings, and Chelsea are top of the league .","Three England internationals make Martin Keown's team of the season .

"A report out of the World Bank shows rapidly expanding China is poised to overtake the once invincible United States as the world's largest economy by the end of 2014. The International Comparison Program looks at exchange rates to reveal purchasing power of different currencies and found that yuan in China will soon pack more punch than the mighty dollar. Meanwhile, Chinese officials bashed the report as flawed, likely for fear of losing its status as a developing nation and the pollution-spewing perks that come with it. Don't count on it: The once invincible American dollar will slip behind China's yuan in terms of purchasing power by the end of 2014, according a World Bank report . China's biggest Asian competitor, India, leaps over Japan from its previous tenth place to become the world's third strongest economy, the report finds. The estimate says that, based on 2011 prices, the purchasing power of the yuan was much stronger than was reflected by exchange rates. By that measure, China's economy was 87 percent the size of the United States' in 2011, or 15 percent bigger than the previous estimate, according to a calculation by RBS economist Louis Kuijs. Faster-growing China would pass the United States in purchasing power terms this year, though it still would be about 60 percent the size of the U.S. economy at market exchange rates. The World Bank's International Comparison Program is conducted every six years and determined that, based on 2011 prices, the purchasing power of the U.S. yuan will surpass that of the U.S. dollar in 2014 despite China's economy being just 60 percent the size of America's at market exchange rates. India has also leap-frogged over Japan to become the world's third largest economy when measured by purchasing power. The current top 10 economies according to the report were as follows: . 1. United States . 2. China . 3. India . 4. Japan . 5. Germany . 6. Russia . 7. Brazil . 8. France . 9. United Kingdom . 10. Indonesia . China is on track to become the No. 1 economy by sheer size by the early 2020s and possibly sooner. But its leaders downplay such comparisons, possibly to avert pressure to take on financial obligations or make concessions on trade or climate change. China's National Bureau of Statistics, which took part in the study, rejected its conclusion, according to the World Bank report. The statistics bureau ‘expressed reservations’ about the study's methodology and ‘did not agree to publish the headline results for China,’ the report said. A figure was estimated anyway by researchers, but ‘the NBS of China does not endorse these results as official statistics,’ the report said. China's government has been reluctant to acknowledge previous milestones showing its economic rise when it passed Germany as the biggest exporter, Japan as the No. 2 economy and the United States as the biggest trader. Its leaders have emphasized China's status as a middle-income country in resisting pressure to adopt binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions, for which their country is the biggest source. The International Comparison Program, conducted every six years, is meant to allow comparisons of living standards in countries with widely varying prices. The results are a good tool for understanding living conditions for Chinese families but other uses are limited, said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital Economics. ‘It does bring home the sheer size of the Chinese economy, in the services and goods and that people in China are producing,’ Williams said. ‘Where it falls short is that it doesn't really tell us about China's economic standing relative to the rest of the world,’ he said. ‘When it comes to China's purchasing power abroad, we need to look at the figures adjusted for market exchange rates.’ The death knell for 142 years of American dominance came just as the U.S. economy slowed drastically in the first three months of the year as a harsh winter exacted a toll on business activity. Asia's rise: The World Bank's International Comparison program conducts a survey every six years to determine relative living conditions and purchasing power world wide. The most recent results indicated China's imminent rise to the top and show India has already leap-frogged past Japan to become the number 3 world economic power . The sharp slowdown, while worse than expected, is likely to be temporary as growth rebounds with warmer weather. The . economy's growth slowed to a barely discernible 0.1 percent annual rate . in the January-March quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the weakest pace since the end of 2012 and was down from a 2.6 percent growth rate in the October-December quarter. Consumer . spending grew at a 3 percent rate. But that gain was dominated by a 4.4 . percent rise in spending on services, reflecting higher utility bills. Spending on goods barely rose. Also dampening growth were a drop in business investment, a rise in the trade deficit and a fall in housing construction. The International Monetary Fund has forecast China's economic growth this year at 7.5 percent, nearly triple the 2.8 percent outlook for the United States. With its much larger population of 1.3 billion people, China barely ranks in the top 100 countries for income per person. The report is a reminder that Chinese consumers only have about one-tenth as much money to spend as Americans, said economist Brian Jackson of IHS Global Insight. That is about half the world average, on par with the Philippines, Bolivia or Iraq. Sellers of consumer goods ‘may find it discouraging, given it implies a relatively low cost regime for final sales,’ Jackson said in an email.","A report out of the World Bank indicates that Chinese purchasing power will surpass that of America in 2014 .

"Prisoners are smoking e-cigarettes as part of a move which could lead to a ban on smoking in jails. E-cigarettes are now being sold in three prisons across the UK as part of a pilot to test whether the alternative could be used instead of cigarettes, BBC news reported. Last year, the prison service said it was committed to banning cigarettes across jails in England and Wales. Prisoners are smoking e-cigarettes as part of a move which could lead to a ban on smoking in jails . An e-cigarette brand is available in shops in women’s prison Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire, as well as men’s prisons Preston Prison in Lancashire and Stocken in Rutland. It was reported that 50 were sold across both male prisons in one week. The move comes after a Guernsey prison banned tobacco last year. The anti-cigarette policy was introduced at Les Nicolles prison following success on the Isle of Man. At Les Nicolles, prisoners now use e-cigarettes instead of traditional tobacco products. Guernsey Prison governor Dave Matthews said last year that the smoking ban at the jail had ‘gone very well’. He said: ‘We have removed tobacco but also provided prisoners with some assistance to try and give up their nicotine habit through the form of patches and the use of Quitline.’ Prisons across Britain currently allow inmates to smoke in their cells but not in communal parts of the jail or in exercise yards (file photo) Prisons across Britain currently allow inmates to smoke in their cells but not in communal parts of the jail or in exercise yards. Of the total prison population, a staggering 80 per cent of inmates smoke. The Prison Officers’ Association has been campaigning for a ban on smoking in all UK prisons since 2007. The POA said they were concerned that staff would be ‘forced to suffer the harmful effects of second-hand smoke’. E-cigarettes have soared in popularity in the UK but any long-term impact on health remains unknown. Critics of the devices fear using them in public could ‘re-normalise’ smoking. An independent review recently found that almost one in 10 smokers had been able to quit thanks to cigarette replacements. A Prison Service spokesman told the BBC: ‘We are looking into whether disposable e-cigarettes are suitable for use in prisons and are currently conducting a trial in three prisons.’ A spokesman for the Prison Governors Association said ‘anything that could protect not only staff but other prisoners and visitors from second-hand smoke inhalation is obviously welcomed. ‘We will be watching this trial with interest to see just how successful it is.’","E-cigarettes now being sold in three prisons as part of pilot scheme .

"Astronomers have found a distant planet so strange, that according to current planet formation theories, it shouldn’t even exist. The planet is 11 times Jupiter’s mass and orbits its star at an incredible 650 times the average Earth-Sun distance. Named HD 106906 b, the planet is unlike anything in our own solar system and doesn’t fit with any existing planet formation theories. Scroll down for video . The planet, whose original name is HD 106906 b, was discovered by the University of Arizona earlier this year and has been baffling scientists ever since . It is thought that planets close to their stars, like Earth, are created from small asteroid-like bodies born in the primordial disk of dust and gas that surrounds a forming star. However, this process acts too slowly to grow giant planets far from their star. Another proposed mechanism is that giant planets can form from a fast, direct collapse of disk material. But primordial disks rarely contain enough mass in their outer reaches to allow a planet like HD 106906 b to be created. Planet HD 106906 b is shown in thermal infrared light. The planet is more than 20 times farther away from its star than Neptune is from our sun . HD 106906 b  is 11 times Jupiter’s mass and orbits its star at an incredible 650 times the average Earth-Sun distance. At only 13 million years old, this young planet still glows from the residual heat of its formation. It . has a temperature of 2,700 Fahrenheit (about 1,500 °C) making it much . cooler than its host star. It emits most of its energy as infrared . rather than visible light. Earth, by comparison, formed 4.5 billion years ago and is about 350 times older. Several alternative theories have been put forward, including formation like a mini binary star system. ‘A binary star system can be formed when two adjacent clumps of gas collapse more or less independently to form stars, and these stars are close enough to each other to exert a mutual gravitation attraction and bind them together in an orbit,’ said Vanessa Bailey, a student at Arizona University who led the research. ‘It is possible that in the case of the HD 106906 system the star and planet collapsed independently from clumps of gas.’ One problem with this scenario is that the mass ratio of the two stars in a binary system is typically no more than 10-to-1. ‘In our case, the mass ratio is more than 100-to-1,’ she explained. ‘This extreme mass ratio is not predicted from binary star formation theories – just like planet formation theory predicts that we cannot form planets so far from the host star.’ The team was able to confirm that the planet is moving together with its host star by examining Hubble Space Telescope data taken eight years prior for another research programme . This system has also sparked interest because researchers can still detect the remnant ‘debris disk’ of material left over from planet and star formation. ‘Systems like this one, where we have additional information about the environment in which the planet resides, have the potential to help us disentangle the various formation models,’ said Ms Bailey added. ‘Future observations of the planet's orbital motion and the primary star's debris disk may help answer that question.’ At only 13 million years old, this young planet still glows from the residual heat of its formation. It has a temperature of 2,700 Fahrenheit (about 1,500°C) making it much cooler than its host star. It emits most of its energy as infrared rather than visible light.

The team was able to confirm that the planet is moving together with its host star by examining Hubble Space Telescope data taken eight years prior for another research programme. ‘Such detailed information is rarely available for directly imaged exoplanets, making HD 106906 b a valuable target for future study,’ said co-investigator Megan Reiter, a graduate student in the UA Department of Astronomy.","The 1,500°C planet, named HD 106906 b, is 11 times Jupiter’s mass .

"Bolton at Home chief executive Jon Lord, pictured, defended the use of seasonal greeting cards to warn against reckless spending over Christmas . A housing association has been attacked as 'insensitive' after it sent Christmas cards to its tenants containing a notice about how far behind they are with their rent. Bolton at Home sent the cards which warned their tenants against over indulging over the Christmas period and ensure their rent is paid. The housing association apologised to any tenants who felt offended by the notices, but said they were just trying to ensure compliance with this 'gentle approach'. One outraged tenant told the Bolton News: 'When the card came through the door, I thought how nice it was for Bolton at Home to wish me seasons greetings. 'But when I opened it to see a reminder of my arrears and a warning about overspending at Christmas I was mortified and really angry. I found it extremely patronising. 'I felt pre-judged. I know what level of arrears I am in. It is under £150 and I am chipping away at it. 'There was just no need for this because they send us formal reminders every 12 weeks. 'It is not an easy time of year for a lot of people and I just think the way this was done could push people over the edge.' Bolton at Home chief executive Jon Lord defended the use of seasonal cards to warn against spending recklessly over the festive period. 'We have sent these cards out for about four years and the comments we have had back suggested that people preferred this approach at this time of year compared to a heavy arrears letter. 'I fully accept that it could be taken both ways, but it is certainly not designed to offend anyone and if that has happened then I apologise. 'There is no easy way to do this but this is the first time we have had complaints about the Christmas cards and we will certainly take them on board.' Mr Lord admitted that he has received a number of complaints that some of the cards had been sent out in unsealed envelopes. He added that it was not his intention to offend anyone during the holiday period. Conservative councillor Martin Cox supported the approach taken by Bolton at Home: 'Landlords will often come across as insensitive or patronising but it is a no-win situation. There is also never a good time to remind people about rent arrears.' Bolton at Home is a registered charity which owns and manages more than 18,000 homes in the Bolton council area. Tenants of the Bolton at Home housing association who were in arrears received a special festive message... ...warning that they are already behind with their rent and not to overspend this Christmas . Housing association tenants have been warned against providing lavish spreads for Christmas dinner as it may push them into debt and threaten their tenancy bringing them to the brink of eviction, file photograph . The independent Money Advice Service recommends that tenants should ensure their rent as well as other priority debts are paid because of the dire consequences associated with non-payment. MAS said priority debts are not necessarily the largest or the ones with the highest interest rates. The most important debts are mortgages, rent and any loans secured against their home. Failure to pay priority debts could see the householder evicted, have their gas or electricity service suspended or even jailed. MAS recommends that once the priority debts are cleared, it is then important to target the bill with the highest interest rate and try and clear that as quickly as possible by over-paying the minimum amount. However, the householder should not neglect other debts, as this could lead to penalty or default charges. Source: Money Advice Service . According to the housing association's website, they charge a rent which is only 80 per cent of the property. Meanwhile, Luton Borough Council has warned its tenants not to allow their home to become someone else's Christmas present by failing to pay their rent or council tax. A statement released on the council's website said: 'It’s easy to spend too much money at Christmas, especially if you have children, and it may be tempting to put off paying your rent or council tax. 'But it isn’t easy to catch up afterwards.We evicted 15 tenants for rent arrears last year and issued over 7,000 summonses to begin recovery action for council tax. 'Up to this October, we have raised 4,372 summonses to begin recovery action; this process adds £120 to the debt already owed by each individual.' Councillor Tom Shaw warned: 'Most people are feeling the economic squeeze at the moment, particularly with the Welfare Reform changes such as the bedroom tax kicking in. But please make paying your rent and council tax a priority over Christmas and New Year and don’t risk losing your home. 'We want people to pay up or seek help immediately before allowing their debts to spiral out of control so we can cut the eviction rate, as well as our arrears bill. 'We work closely with the Citizens’ Advice Bureau, Luton Foodbank, local credit unions and a wide range of other organisations offering advice and support to anyone with financial problems. 'But we will evict or take legal action when necessary against our debtors, particularly where someone won’t pay, rather than can’t pay.'","Landlord sent tenants rent arrears notices disguised as Christmas cards .

"The Argentine journalist who first noted the significance of Top Gear's controversial number plate has slammed the TV crew's claims that any reference to the Falklands War was a coincidence. Carlos Cristofalo, the reporter who runs Autoblog Argentina, first spotted what he thought was a reference to the Falklands War on Jeremy Clarkson's 'H982FKL' number plate on September 19. Tweeting a photo of the vehicle, he asked if anyone else noticed the reference to the 1982 conflict. Within a few days, the number plate had caused such outrage among locals that the Top Gear crew had been chased out of the country. Scroll down for video . The controversial number plate was first questioned when Mr Cristofalo tweeted this photograph of it on September 19 . In the wake of the incident, Clarkson and other members of the production team claimed the numbering on the plate being a reference to the war was entirely coincidental. But Mr Cristofalo has now told The Telegraph the suggestion it was a coincidence is absurd given the history of the show. He said: 'No one who has seen every series of Top Gear can think that it was a casual thing. Top Gear always makes these kinds of jokes. 'We have a profound respect for what Top Gear means to the history of television. But we just regret that Top Gear doesn't respect its audience and dignifies them with a proper explanation of what went on.' Writing in his column in The Sun after leaving the country, Clarkson later maintained the number plate scandal was not deliberate, and said that if it had been, the BBC would have fired him. Recalling how the number plate controversy came about, Clarkson said when he asked the office to find a Porsche 928GT, only two were available. One was grey and the other black. He said because black 'doesn't work on television' he chose the grey one, and 'didn't even see it' until he arrived in Argentina. The Porsche 928GT had a licence plate that read H982 FKL which locals believed was in reference to the Falklands War; Clarkson said his crew changed the plate as soon as the controversy was pointed out to them . The Top Gear convoy pictured prior to fleeing the country, with the offending number plate attached to the front of the lead car . Clarkson went on to say no one in the Top Gear crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in Chile. Its significance was pointed out to the crew on the internet, the show's executive producer has said. Government officials were then contacted and asked if the plate would be a problem when they arrived in Ushuaia two weeks later, Clarkson said. The were told to change it before they arrived, which Clarkson said created continuity issues as the car had already been filmed. To make up for continuity issues involving the plates Clarkson said the crew created these joke plates which they were going to put on the car to make him look 'idiotic' when he was driving around . Clarkson said they then formed a 'cunning plan' to make-up for the number plate swap. They created joke plates - saying BE11 END - which they planned to film May and Hammond fitting on the car without his knowledge making him look 'idiotic' when he drove it. But before the crew had a chance to film the scene they were set upon by an angry mob who threw rocks at their cars. The H982 FKL plates were then removed, revealing an old personal plate underneath, which they left on, then drove off. The cars were later abandoned. The episode featuring the incident is due to air over two parts on  December 27 and 28.","Journalist who first spotted controversy slams claims it was a coincidence .

"There have been 40 separate threats against New York City police officers reported since the fatal shooting of two officers in Brooklyn Saturday, the NYPD said in a statement Wednesday. Officials say that though the threats -- which are under investigation -- have not been deemed credible, four arrests have been made since the shooting, ABC News reports. Mayor Bill de Blasio said it is the city's 'obligation' to stop future tragedies. The Mayor vowed Wednesday to protect officers. Scroll down for video . Threates: There have been 40 separate threats against New York City police officers reported since the fatal shooting of two officers in Brooklyn Saturday . Mayor: In a statement Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio (photographed) vowed to protect police officers saying it is the city's 'obligation' to stop future tragedies . Police have increased security at some stationhouses. Emergency Services Unit officers were providing additional protection at two Brooklyn precincts, where they were stationed starting Tuesday. NYPD Sgt. Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said in a statement Wednesday that the department 'received notice there would be a violent act committed at Precincts 73rd, 79th, and 81st in Bedford-Stuyvesant,' the neighborhood where Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down Saturday, according to ABC. Police said Wednesday they were remaining vigilant while investigating the origin of the threats, which they didn't detail. Two Officers: Four arrests have been made and 40 separate threats have been reported since the Dec. 20 murder of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu who were gunned down while sitting in a patrol car . Concern: John Miller, head of NYPD intelligence and counterterrorism, said that out of the 40 threats received by the NYPD, only 'a handful are of concern' John Miller, head of NYPD intelligence and counterterrorism, told Newsday that out of the 40 threats received by the NYPD, only 'a handful are of concern.' 'A lot are just angry people blowing off steam with inappropriate comments,' Miller said. 'Some guy says 'I was drunk and didn't mean it' . . . About a half-dozen at any one time are concerning.' Meanwhile, an 18-year-old was facing charges of making a terroristic threat after authorities said he put up a menacing photo and message online on Saturday hours after the afternoon ambush of  Liu  Ramos by a gunman who had signaled his plans on social media. Freed: Devon Coley, 18, (photographed) was freed without bail after posting a threatening photo to Facebook . Teenager Devon Coley posted a photo on his Facebook page Saturday night of a gunman shooting at a patrol car, symbols showing a gun pointed at an officer's head and a caption with his local precinct's number and 'next,' according to a court complaint. His lawyer, Daniel Ades, said Wednesday that the state terroristic-threats law was being misapplied. 'Nobody's condoning threats against police,' he said, but 'even if this is proven, it doesn't amount to a crime.' He noted that the law requires a 'reasonable expectation or fear' that a threat meant to influence government or intimidate the public is about to be carried out. Prosecutors sought $250,000 bail for Coley, who was already facing unrelated gun possession and other charges, the New York Post reported. Court records show a judge released him without bail on the threats charge. The New York Post reports that the judge who released Coley, criminal court Judge Laura Johnson, has come under fire for her decision and cops reacted with even more fury when she did so a second time Thursday. The judge freed Travis Maye, 26, Thursday who was arrested for allegedly punching an officer and he told his arresting officers that he would find out where they live and 'get' them. 'You will die!' he allegedly told the officers. Maye was freed without bail. Officials said they had assessed hundreds of online postings and calls to emergency lines, initiating about 40 threat probes, with about half of those being closed or referred to other agencies. '73Nextt:' Here is the post that prompted the arrest of Coley, the caption reads '73Nextt,' referring to the 73 precinct that covers the teens Brownsville neighborhood . The police department said one 52-year-old man had been arrested after walking into a Manhattan stationhouse and saying: 'If I punch you in the face, how much time will I get?' and refusing to leave. In addition, two Staten Island residents were arrested in separate incidents on Tuesday. A 16-year-old was arrested on a charge of making a terrorist threat and a 46-year-old man was charged with making a false report. Mayor de Blasio denounced the various threats Wednesday and said the city 'will protect the men and women who protect us.' 'New York City stands with our police officers in this time of tragedy, as we do every day, and our city will not be intimidated by those spouting hateful, violent messages,' he said in a statement. 'Cowardly threats of violence against the brave men and women of our police force will not be tolerated.'","There have been 40 separate threats against New York City police officers reported since the fatal shooting of two officers in Brooklyn Saturday .

"The secret to successfully adapting from city to country life is to spend as much time in the pub as possible and to take the dog for a walk, research has revealed. A survey, which spoke to 501 people who had recently ditched the rat race for rural life, asked how they had adjusted to their new community. It found the pub to be one of the best ways to mingle with locals, as well as joining the church and using stores in the area as frequently as possible. Scroll down for video . The secret to adapting to country life is to frequent the pub often and to take the dog for walks, a study has revealed. File photo . The research, commissioned by Sky 1, also revealed that more than a quarter of those who have recently moved to the countryside admitted it was harder than they thought it would be. A yearning for the bright city lights and the dramatic change in the pace of life proved to be some of the most difficult hurdles to overcome. It also emerged that typically it takes people a year and two weeks to feel totally settled in their new surroundings. But despite extensive efforts, around one in ten said they had 'failed' to integrate, and were happy to consider themselves 'not part of the community'. The survey also found those who enjoyed a seamless transition from city to country made an effort to go to as many local events as possible in a bid to meet people. Walking a pet around the streets was also revealed as an effective way to get to know neighbours and other villagers. Buying all produce locally also helped as did volunteering where possible. Throwing parties for Halloween, Bonfire Night and Christmas also made a significant difference in the amount it took people to settle after moving from a city. Holding coffee mornings and offering to 'pet-sit' are also tactics which appear to have worked. The study also showed that more than half of those polled who had made the move had since managed to persuade friends or family to come and join them away from the hustle and bustle of a city. Most of those (23%) who quit city life said they did so because they wanted to escape the rat race, while one in five moved for employment reasons. Upsizing, moving back to their roots, or upping sticks to move closer to an elderly relative were also common reasons for making the move. Others moved after retiring or to downsize. And the move is clearly one worth making, as three quarters of the respondents stated they were 'much happier' in the country than they were in the city. But almost one in three said they had mulled over the possibility of returning to city life. A Sky spokesperson said: 'Moving somewhere new can leave us feeling like a fish out of water. 'So it makes sense that popping into the local for a pint or a meal from time to time can help people ease themselves into a new area and way of life. 'Good village pubs are alive and kicking, and they are often still seen as the heart of smaller communities, so they are an obvious place to start socialising with local people.'","Survey spoke to people who had recently moved from cities to the country .

"She won't be the only one feeling the pain after a night of Christmas excess. But Bella the German Shepherd may think twice before lapping up a litre bottle of advocaat again - as the drunken dog ended up needing emergency treatment at an animal hospital. The mischievous puppy managed to knock the 17.2 per cent bottle of liqueur off a table when her owner was out - and when the glass smashed she thirstily licked up the sweet-tasting alcohol. 'Boozy Bella': Bella the German Shepherd required emergency treatment after knocking a litre bottle of advocaat off a table when her owner was out - and lapping up the contents . Her shocked owner Rachel Day returned to her home in Shepherds Bush, London, to find Bella looking worse for wear, bumping into walls and struggling to walk. After finding the broken bottle, which costs £11, the mother-of-four put two and two together. Seventh-month-old Bella was rushed to the Blue Cross animal hospital in Victoria, Central London where vets put her on a drip to try to flush the alcohol out of her system. She was kept in overnight to sleep off her heavy drinking session and was allowed to go home the next morning after making a full recovery.

Yesterday Ms Day said: 'I had only gone out for an hour and a half, and when I got back I found the smashed bottle. 'It was a Warninks-brand advocaat and we were very much looking forward to drinking it over Christmas. 'I had to mop up some of the liquid but most of it had gone. 'It wasn't until a few minutes later when I saw Bella attempting and failing to walk properly that I put two and two together. The mischievous puppy managed to knock the bottle of liqueur off a table when her owner was out . 'She had been sleeping, but then she tried to get up and just started banging into walls. She looked like a drunk person. 'There was lager and coca-cola on the table outside too, but she obviously knew what she preferred. 'I think she just wanted to enter into the festive spirit but she evidently didn't know her limits. 'I had got home at about 4pm, and we were at the vets within the hour and thankfully we were able to deal with it in time. Her owner Rachel Day said: 'I think she probably just felt a bit left out because she hadn't got her own Christmas drink, but I will have to make sure I keep the bottles completely out of reach in future' 'They flushed her out and put her on a drip. 'She's a big dog though. When I went to collect her the next morning she was as chirpy as always, she didn't have a hangover at all. 'She's such a wonderful character. The vets fell in love with her as well - they nicknamed her 'Boozy Bella'. 'It was really scary at the time when we weren't even sure if she would pull through, but we can laugh about it now.

'Because Bella is almost fully grown and quite a big dog the damage is not as bad as it may have been with a smaller breed, which could have proved fatal.

"Renovations to the Prime Minister's Lodge in Canberra will now cost tax payers $6.4 million - making it more expensive than building an entirely new residence. Contract documents posted on the Australian government's AusTender website shows the cost of renovating the 40-room historic building now occupied by Prime Minister Tony Abbott has more than doubled from the original estimate price of $3.1 million. The upgrades, which started in September 2013 and were commissioned by the former Labor government, have been delayed and could now stretch on until December next year. Scroll down for video . Renovations to the Prime Minister's Lodge in Canberra will now cost tax payers $6.4 million - making it more expensive than building an entirely new residence . Part of the delays rest with trying to find bathroom and toilet fittings that are aligned with strict heritage requirements, the Herald Sun reports. Renovations to the building built in 1920 include replacing the slate roof, asbestos removal, complete rewiring, insulating the ceiling, replacing old gutters and plumbing and fixing leaky bathrooms. The original contract and costs for the Lodge renovations have been amended more than 15 times since April this year.

Tony Abbott never moved into the residence with his family and has spent the past 14 months in a $110 a night room at the Australia Federal Police College in Barton, just two kilometres away from the Lodge. While public servants had rented Mr Abbott a $3,000 a week home as renovations took place, he declined and it cost $65,000 in lease termination fees. The Lodge, which is located in Deakin at 5 Adelaide Avenue, is just a stone's throw away from Parliament House. It is one of Canberra's more prestigious suburbs.

During his time on the show, Mike was known for singing country and western music, and was credited by the mentors for his efforts in getting the genre noticed in the UK. The singer took to Twitter to express his shock at his father's death, posting a photograph of the pair together and writing: 'Can't believe I lost you today dad .. & you actually had hair .. Gonna miss you R.I.P.' Ms Jolly, from Dudley, had been reunited with her family five months ago and was planning to spend Christmas with her loved ones for the first time in years. Ms Jolly's devastated mother Sylvia Duddle, 61, told the M.E.N: 'We were in contact again, it was like a fresh start. 'She was supposed to be coming to one of my other daughter’s houses today and stay for Christmas. I’m absolutely devastated. I feel broken - like my heart has been ripped out.'

The incident took place as the couple were crossing Princess Road at the junction of Greenheys Lane outside an Asda superstore at about 10.15pm yesterday. Both were hit by a blue Vauxhall Corsa. Mr Ward died at 10.45am today while being treated at Manchester Royal Infirmary. Paramedics had been unable to save Ms Jolly - and a witness described on social media how this was despite their best efforts. Gemma Partington said: ‘Saw the paramedics working so hard to save the lady's life last night at the side of the road. Very sad to hear she didn't make it. RIP. Wishing the man a full recovery.’ Pc Paul Joynson, from Greater Manchester Police’s serious collision investigation unit, said: ‘Our thoughts and sympathies are with the families of the man and woman at this tragic time and we have specially-trained officers supporting them. ‘We are keen to speak to anyone who saw the blue Vauxhall Corsa in the area shortly before the collision, and I would urge you to speak to police if you have any piece of information, no matter how small.

"New Labour's 24-hour drinking laws have left Britain 'awash' with cheap alcohol and plagued by late night violence, experts warned last night. Home Office figures reveal there are now a record number of trouble hotspots – with 208 neighbourhoods officially classified as being 'saturated' with problem pubs or bars. To the fury of medical experts, there is also a record number of supermarkets, petrol stations and convenience stores selling booze around the clock – fuelling harmful drinking. Scroll down for video . New Labour's 24-hour drinking laws, introduced in 2005, has left Britain 'awash' with cheap alcohol . The scale of Britain's drinking culture is laid bare by the Home Office's annual report on alcohol and late night refreshment licensing, slipped out shortly before Christmas . Adding to the misery inflicted on residents, the number of late night takeaway shops servicing the bars and off-licences has hit an all-time high of 87,000. The Tories had pledged to end the chaos caused by New Labour's licensing reforms, which occurred in 2005 in the face of fierce opposition from police and GPs, as well as a Daily Mail campaign. But the powers they gave town halls to limit opening hours in problem areas and make bars and clubs pay for extra policing have proved a spectacular flop. By the end of March this year, only one so-called late night levy had been introduced and there was not a single order to restrict early morning alcohol sales. Last night council leaders demanded a change to the rules – labelling the current powers 'unwieldy, bureaucratic, and extremely costly and time-consuming'. Health campaigners said one of the most devastating consequences of 24-hour drinking laws has been shops selling cheap alcohol all day and night. Of the 7,353 licences in force for round-the-clock opening, more than a quarter (2,065) were for supermarkets and convenience stores. Chief constables have since declared 24-hour drinking a failed 'experiment' which did not usher in the promised 'café culture' The total number of premises licensed to sell alcohol is stable at 204,300, as is the overall number of 24-hour drinking licences, which stands at 8,200 . Liver specialist Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance, said: 'We are awash with outlets selling cheap drink. I don't think actually the general public is in favour of this and I don't think they know what to do about it. It beggars belief you can buy a bottle of wine at a garage at 2am. 'The whole direction of policy is in deregulation, to make alcohol an ordinary product just like soap powder rather than realising it is a drug of dependence. The problem is supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations selling cheap drink.' The scale of Britain's drinking culture is laid bare by the Home Office's annual report on alcohol and late night refreshment licensing, slipped out shortly before Christmas. The total number of premises licensed to sell alcohol is stable at 204,300, as is the overall number of 24-hour drinking licences, which stands at 8,200. But the number of supermarkets and shops which never close is up by 5 per cent. There has also been an alarming 19 per cent spike in the amount of so-called cumulative impact zones – up from 175 a year ago. This means a town centre or neighbourhood is officially considered to be a trouble hotspot which is at 'saturation' point and cannot cope with new premises opening. Trouble in these areas ranges from fighting and litter to drug dealing, pick-pocketing and robbery. Many are now found in small, previously quiet towns which used to have few crimes of this nature. At the end of March 2007, when the licensing laws had been relaxed for just over a year, there were only 71 of these zones in the UK. To the fury of medical experts, there is also a record number of supermarkets, petrol stations and convenience stores selling booze around the clock – fuelling harmful drinking . Upon coming to office, the Conservatives promised to limit the worst impact of the change in the law with two new powers: late night levies which would see late-opening problem venues pay more for their licence, and early morning alcohol restriction orders, or EMROs. EMROs enable town halls to prohibit the sale of alcohol for a specified time period between midnight and 6am in the whole or part of their area. Yet, despite being launched amid great fanfare, there was not a single EMRO in force at the end of March this year. And at the end of that month there was just a single late night levy, which raised £300,000 from pub and bar owners in Newcastle; a city notorious for drunken late night scenes. Cllr Ann Lucas, chairman of the Local Government Association's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said: 'Councils are being hamstrung by the current systems for implementing early morning restriction orders and late night levies, which are unwieldy, bureaucratic, and extremely costly and time-consuming. 'Local authorities are forced to hold numerous hearings, and call scores of witnesses as a result of multiple representations by the alcohol industry. However, residents – who do not have access to expensive lawyers – struggle to be heard because of the number and complexity of forms they must fill out. 'Late night levies must be introduced across councils' entire areas, which makes it extremely difficult to target them effectively.' Home Office figures reveal there are now a record number of trouble hotspots – with 208 neighbourhoods officially classified as being 'saturated' with problem pubs or bars . The Daily Mail – backed by senior police, ambulance staff and judges – opposed the 2005 relaxation of the licensing laws. Chief constables have since declared 24-hour drinking a failed 'experiment' which did not usher in the promised 'café culture'. Last year, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said the situation was so bad that private sector-run 'drunk tanks' should be introduced to care for the inebriated. Last night, Labour's shadow home office spokesman Diana Johnson said: 'Theresa May's record on alcohol is one of broken promises and failed policies.' Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'The Government is taking a range of action to address the £11billion a year that alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder costs England and Wales. 'We have given local areas more powers to deal with alcohol-related disorder, and I have recently written to local authorities and police and crime commissioners to remind them of these important measures. 'We have also lowered the evidence threshold for decision-making to make it easier for licensing authorities and the police to review, revoke or impose conditions on licences. 'Seven local authority areas have now decided to introduce a [late night] levy.'","Home Office figures show shocking results of the 24-hour drinking laws .

"Warning: Robert Zoellick said Europe is heading to the 'danger zone' The head of the World Bank yesterday warned that financial markets face a rerun of the Great Panic of 2008. On the bleakest day for the global economy this year,  Robert Zoellick said crisis-torn Europe was heading for the ‘danger zone’. Mr Zoellick, who stands down at the end of the month after five years in charge of the watchdog, said it was ‘far from clear that eurozone leaders have steeled themselves’ for the looming  catastrophe amid fears of a Greek exit from the single currency and meltdown in Spain. The flow of money into so-called ‘safe havens’ such as UK, German and US government debt turned into a stampede yesterday. In Berlin the two-year government bond yield fell below zero for the first time, with the bizarre result that jittery international investors are now  paying – rather than being paid – for lending to Germany. There was a raft of dismal economic news from around the world, with manufacturing output falling in Britain and Europe, unemployment jumping in the eurozone and America, and fast-emerging economies such as Brazil and China showing signs of running out of steam. The FTSE 100 index fell 60.67 points to a new 2012 low of 5260.19 in London and the pound tumbled against the US dollar to $1.5234 – a level not seen since January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 200 points in New York, wiping out all its gains this year. Borrowing costs in Spain and Italy have soared back above 6 per cent towards the 7 per cent level that triggered bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Mr Zoellick warned that the coming months could be as bad as the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008. Plunging: The Dow Jones (left) opened down and the FTSE 100 (right) hit a year-long dip yesterday . Desperate: European leaders scrambled to stop the financial crisis in Spain spiralling out of control and infecting other countries such as Italy . He said: ‘Events in Greece could . trigger financial fright in Spain, Italy and across the eurozone. The . summer of 2012 offers an eerie echo of 2008. ‘If Greece leaves the eurozone, the contagion is impossible to predict, just as Lehman had unexpected consequences.’ BP is on the verge of a humiliating exit from its lucrative Russian business, following repeated rows with its oligarch partners. The oil giant said it was looking to sell its 50 per cent stake in joint venture TNK-BP. This could raise £23billion for BP but would have a huge impact on its profitability because the venture has been highly lucrative. TNK-BP’s oilfields account for 29 per cent of BP’s production and a quarter of its oil reserves. Its latest spat with the other half of TNK-BP – Alfa Access Renova (AAR) – began with BP’s attempt to form a partnership with rival,  Kremlin-backed oil firm Rosneft to drill in the Arctic. AAR – a group of four oligarchs: Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg and Leonid Blavatnik – angrily blocked the deal. Fears are mounting that Spain will be crippled by its banking sector and will be the next domino to fall. Mr Zoellick said: ‘Eurozone leaders need to be prepared to recapitalise banks. In the eurozone, the guarantees of some national sovereigns are unlikely to be sufficient and only that of the “euro-sovereign” will suffice. ‘It is far from clear that eurozone leaders have steeled themselves for this step. Eurozone leaders need to be ready. 'There will not be time for meetings of finance ministers to discuss the outlook and debate the politics. 'In panicked markets, investors flee to safe assets, sparking other flames.’ Yesterday investors scrambling for lifelines piled into German, US and UK government debt. Not only did the German two-year bond . yield fall below zero for the first time, but also the yield on . ten-year UK gilts – the benchmark borrowing cost for the British . Government – hit a record low of 1.44 per cent. The yield on the equivalent US treasuries fell to 1.46 per cent – the lowest in over 200 years of records. ‘People’s objective is the return of . their capital, not the return they get on their capital,’ said Sam Hill, . a strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. ÷ Ireland has accepted tough new . budget controls, as stipulated under the European fiscal treaty, in a . referendum which saw 60 per cent of voters backing the deal. Crisis: Spain's government nationalised major bank Bankia earlier this month, and now says it needs to inject $23.6billion in public money into the bank . Eurozone unemployment has hit a record high and job losses are likely to keep climbing as the debt crisis eats away at businesses' ability to hire workers while indebted governments continue to cut staff. Around 17.4million people were out of work in the 17-nation eurozone in April (11 per cent of the working population) - the highest level since records began in 1995, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said today. 'This 11 percent level is going to continue edging up in the coming months and probably until the end of the year,' said Francois Cabau, an economist at Barclays Capital who sees the eurozone's economy contracting 0.1 per cent this year. 'The economic activity situation tells you the story of the labour market. There's been basically no economic growth since the fourth quarter of last year and indicators are pointing to very weak growth momentum for the second quarter,' he said. ING economist Martin van Vliet said he sees the unemployment rate reaching slightly above 11.5 per cent if the economy starts to recover later this year. But if the downturn worsens, 'the risk is for an even higher peak in unemployment,' he said. As the debt crisis intensifies, companies in the euro zone are trying to keep their labour costs low as they struggle with falling demand and profits, while a German-led drive to cut deficits and debt is pressuring governments to shrink spending. But some economists say austerity policies in an economic downturn are self-defeating because governments receive less tax receipts as unemployment grows and must pay out more money in jobless benefits.","Robert Zoellick: 'Far from clear leaders ready for impending catastrophe'

"If you were disappointed that Father Christmas brought sunshine instead of snow for Christmas Day, you may not have to wait too long. Forecasters predict temperatures are set to plummet today – and there is even a risk of storms. The Met Office has issued a cold weather alert for large parts of England and severe weather warnings for snow from this afternoon. It is due to a so-called weather 'bomb' – or rapid cyclogenesis as it is known in technical terms – which will see snow and gale force winds bring misery to vast swathes of Britain. Scroll down for video . A resident wades through the water of Windermere after heavy rainfall left the area flooded this morning .

And swimmers taking part in the annual Peter Pan Cup race in the Serpentine in central London were able to enjoy slightly less icy water than usual. Bookmakers are offering odds of 5/4 that it will snow today. Forecasters are not sure which regions in the UK will experience snow, but high ground is set to see three or four inches. There will also be gusty 40mph winds bringing rain and sleet. The unsettled weather threatens to disrupt one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Millions are expected to hit the roads to visit relatives and friends or hit the sales but they have been warned to keep up to date with forecasts. There has been localised flooding in some parts of the UK and the Environment Agency has nine flood alerts in place – three in the north east, four in the north west and one each in the south east and south west. Residents in Windermere had an early taste of what is to come after they awoke yesterday to find Lake Windermere had broken its banks after days of rainfall, submerging large parts of the locality. There was also snow in Scotland before Christmas. The Met Office said: 'An area of rain, sleet and snow is expected to spread eastwards across parts of Northern Ireland, England and Wales during Boxing Day before clearing during overnight. 'A lot of uncertainty surrounds how much snow will occur, but there is the risk of several centimetres even at low levels. As precipitation clears, roads could turn very icy.

"Old-fashioned girls' names such as Doris, Edna and Hilda are making a comeback, but Harper - the name of the Beckhams' daughter - has climbed the highest on the 2014 list of baby names. Rising 67 places to number 77, Harper outstripped the likes of Thea, Darcie and Lottie to become the girls' name growing fastest in popularity. The list also revealed some of the more unconventional names given to babies in 2014, including Royal, King, Thor and Dyson, as in the vacuum cleaners. Harper, the name of the Beckhams' daughter, has climbed the highest on the list of baby names for girls in 2014 . Hilda, Edna, Dilys and Doris, which hark back to the Second World War, are making a slight comeback after years of lying dormant. Among the odd names given to boys this year are Muse, as in the rock band, and Memphis, the birthplace of Elvis Presley. Made in Chelsea also appears to have influenced Britain's parents, with Hugo, as in Taylor, and Ollie, as in Locke, climbing the table. Amelia, Olivia and Emily remain the top three names for girls, holding the same positions as last year. Jack still tops the list for boys, holding off stiff competition from Oliver and Charlie, which climbed one place to third. THE BOYS . 1. Kian . 2. Teddy . 3. Elijah . 4. Hugo . 5. Ollie . 6.

The trends emerged from Bounty Parenting Club's annual report of names handed out to 370,000 babies who were born in the UK this year. Bounty spokeswoman Lisa Penney said: 'Only a handful of parents named their girls Edna, Hilda and Doris, but this could well be the start of something. 'The trend for old-fashioned names continues to grow for girls and boys. Even Simon Cowell took the plunge this year naming his baby son Eric after his own father. 'Celebrities like the Beckhams are renowned for choosing unusual names for their offspring and today's parents are quick to follow a trend in a bid to make sure their choice of baby names stands out from the crowd. 'But baby name trends can change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom. 'Just a couple of years ago Ava and Isla were relatively unheard of as a baby girl's name, yet now they regularly feature in the top ten. 'Likewise for boys, a decade ago the names Jacob and Noah were rarely considered and now they are in the top 10 as parents look beyond previously traditional biblical names like Matthew, Luke and Adam.' The name Doris, made popular shortly after the Second World War by the actress Doris Day, is making a comeback . Old-fashioned girls' Edna and Hilda are also returning, but Amelia, Olivia and Emily are the three most popular names for the second year running .

'Like celebrities, parents are getting more and more creative with their name choices. 'Indeed, for some the sky really is the limit when it comes to creating something unique. 'Generally speaking whatever a child is called they usually grow up to make it their own, yet mums and dads should bear in mind that a really individual name can be a lot to live up to if you don't grow up to be rich or famous.'","Harper has climbed highest on list of most popular baby names for girls .

"A schoolboy has landed a catch of a lifetime - a monstrous 8ft catfish  weighing the same as a champion boxer. The carnivorous catfish had snatched the live bait from 14-year-old Sam Lee's line who was on a fishing holiday in Spain with his father Peter. Weighing in at 208lb, similar to that of boxing champion David Haye, it was never going to be an easy battle to pull him in. The giant catfish, which weighs a staggering 208lb and is 2.6 metres long, dwarfs Sam  after he caught the monster on a fishing holiday in Spain . The giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream, but Sam, from Chester, hung on. And finally, after a 35 minute battle, Sam finally landed the 15 stone, 2.5 metre-long fish. In time honoured tradition, he then posed for the traditional photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia. His father Peter: 'Sam certainly hit the jackpot with that monster! He was exhausted but ecstatic after the fish was eventually landed, weighed and photographed. It was safely returned to the river and swam away in good health.' Sam fought for more than half an hour to land the fish after it snatched the live bait on the end of his line but was eventually able to catch it and pose for a traditional photo . Sam, who attends Upton High School, has loved fishing for years and his latest catch is the biggest yet. He landed a 133lb catfish on the same stretch of river during a holiday last year and never expected to beat that. But he quickly hooked a 133lb fish this time before feeling the tug of the 208lb fish on the end of his line later on. Peter, who hooked a rare albino catfish weighing 116lb, said they had 'an amazing few days' fishing. 'This was his third trip to the Ebro in search of giant catfish. 'The big one took 35 minutes to land and Sam had to be taken out in a boat by the guide from the swim to play and land it as it stripped 100m of line on its first big run. Sam did brilliantly to land it.' Earlier this year an eight foot 260lb Wels catfish was caught in Italy by angler Dino Ferrari on the River Po in Italy. But the European catch to beat is the Guinness World Record of 297lbs, 9 oz. But the biggest on record is the Mekong catfish, found in Southeast Asia, which was recorded as  8ft 9in long and just a sliver under 646 pounds.","Sam Lee was fishing with his father when he felt the monster take the bait .

"It appears Santa's little helper went overboard with the celebrations on Christmas Day. To get through working on one of the merriest days of the year, police on duty today have taken to social media to share a bit of festive cheer and a timely message for all. It all started with an anonymous tip from a man - who only wanted to be known as 'Mr S' - which led to the arrest of an elf for drink driving. Police made no exceptions and caught the wayward elf in Scone - in the Hunter Region which is north of Sydney - and breathalysed him, where he blew mid-range. Scroll down for video . Police say they caught the elf in Scone, in the Hunter Region which is north of Sydney, and breathalysed him, where he blew mid-range . An anonymous tip from a man - who only wanted to be known as 'Mr S' - which led to the arrest an elf for drink driving . Police on duty during Christmas Day took to social media to share a bit of festive cheer and a timely message for all: 'drink driving...it's a crime' Several images of the elf, who has not been named, were posted on Hunter Valley local area command's Facebook page on Christmas morning. It was a parody with a serious road safety reminder for Aussie motorists. 'He [the elf] has had his free phone call and is now waiting in the dock to be charged,' police wrote on Facebook. 'Has been photographed. Currently being fingerprinted. Drink driving...it's a crime.' The elf, who's sure to be on the 'naughty' list next year,  signed his licence suspension notice and was granted conditional bail. Police wrote that the elf is expected to appear at the Scone Local Court on January 22, 2015. Senior Constable Jason Lambert says in reality, mid-range drink driving can result in suspension of licence on the spot and a hefty fine - clearly not an ideal way to spend  Christmas. 'The Facebook posts were all a bit of fun but is also a way for us to get the message across especially at this time of year,' he told Daily Mail Australia. And it wasn't just NSW Police who had a bit of a laugh on social media. Australian police across the state took to Twitter on Christmas Day, being prompted by Queensland officers who asked: 'Hey @nswpolice @VictoriaPolice @SAPoliceNews @TasmaniaPolice, have you guys seen Santa yet?' In response to the question, NSW Police wrote: 'Left cookies + milk (full cream, skim & soy - we never know his tastes these days).' 'We have made sure cookies are gluten free & our reindeer food organic,' Victoria Police also tweeted.

"From stockpiling extra cash to possibly authorizing advances to customers who rely on federal benefit payments, banks are working out how to help customers cope should the federal budget impasse not be resolved by next week. Currently partially curtailed, all federal government activities will come to a complete halt in nine days should Democrats and Republicans not come to a budget agreement that includes raising the debt ceiling. With the government expected to run out of money October 17, many Americans are nervous about what the impact will be to them, and banks are taking steps to make sure customer needs are met. Working from a playbook: A number of banks are working out contingency plans to help customers should federal benefit payments halt next week as a result of a full government shutdown . An unidentified bank began upping cash reserves at retail branches by at least 20 per cent last week, according to a senior banking executive who spoke to the New York Times. The extra cash is likely coming from financial institutions such as Citigroup and Morgan Stanley selling government bonds, the Times reported. This action is a strong signal that Wall Street’s faith in Washington is diminishing. That same bank is also planning to ensure customers’ who rely on payments from Social Security or similar programs will be able to overdraft their accounts without incurring fees, the executive further divulged. Interest-free cash advances are also being considered in the event benefit payments are delayed, the executive noted. Endangering the masses: Banks are fielding many concerns from customers and are working to ensure customers are affected as little as possible . Part of what the Financial Times referred to as a ‘playbook,’ the measures were first conceived in 2011 as a government default loomed in the waning days of summer. Stockpiling cash at retail banking branches is being done should customers decide that stuffing money in mattresses is better than leaving it in accounts no longer insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 worth of deposits. Should the borrowing limit not be raised, the U.S. government’s obligations will exceed its ability to pay, forcing the government into a first-ever default. Let's make a deal: President Barack Obama signaled a willingness to make concessions during a Tuesday news conference . Most experts agree that a breach of the debt ceiling would lead to grave consequences, including a freeze in credit, severe drops in securities markets, and a global economic downturn as bad – if not worse - as 2008’s Great Recession. Failure to raise the debt ceiling would lead to a ‘very, very severe recession with no obvious way out,” Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi told the Wall Street Journal. ‘Not only might the economic consequences of default be profound,’ the Treasury Department wrote last week in a report, ‘those consequences, including high interest rates, reduced investment, higher debt payments, and slow economic growth, could last for more than a generation.’ Despite these dire predictions, some in Congress are taking a laissez-faire approach to resolving the issue. Extra cash: Many banks are fearful that customers will withdraw increased amounts of cash to sit on should the government default (though pictured here, there is not indication Capital One Bank is taking such action) Louisiana Republican John Fleming has compared economists to weather forecasters. 'Economists, what have they been doing? They make all sorts of predictions,' Mr Fleming said. 'Many times they’re wrong, so I don’t think we should run government based on economists’ predictions.' Florida Republican Ted Yoho said global financial markets would stabilize, should a default occur. President Barack Obama, in remarks Tuesday from the White House, signalled a willingness to compromise, admitting he’d be open to a short-term budget while a longer-term solution is worked out. ‘We recognize,' Mr Obama conceded, 'that there are going to have to be some compromises between the Democratic position and the Republican position.’ The government has nine days to avoid a potential economic calamity, but the nation’s banks are not standing idly by during another looming default.","American banks are preparing contingencies in the event of a U.S. government default .

"Once, it would have been unthinkable – but this year's Christmas message from the Queen included an appearance from former IRA commander Martin McGuinness. He was shown accompanying the monarch earlier this year on a visit to Crumlin Road Gaol – where he was once imprisoned. The footage played as the Queen stressed the importance of reconciliation, after a year that nearly saw Scotland leave the United Kingdom. Reconciliation: The Queen's Christmas message included footage of her meeting with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness (left), who is the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland . The footage played as the Queen stressed the importance of reconciliation, after a year that nearly saw Scotland leave the United Kingdom . Two years ago, the monarch shook hands with Mr McGuinness, now Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister, when they met in Belfast for the first time. He also enjoyed a private meeting with the Queen, whose cousin Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979. Mr McGuinness, who later said that he ‘liked’ the Queen, went on to attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle this year, where he shook her hand once again. The monarch began yesterday’s televised address by talking about a sculpture of a man and woman embracing by Josefina de Vasconcellos called Reconciliation, casts of which can be found in Berlin, Coventry and Belfast. She said: ‘The benefits of reconciliation were clear to see when I visited Belfast in June. While my tour of the set of Game Of Thrones may have gained most attention, my visit to the Crumlin Road Gaol will remain vividly in my mind. What was once a prison during The Troubles is now a place of hope and fresh purpose ... a reminder of what is possible when people reach out to one another, rather like the couple in the sculpture.’ While she did not mention Mr McGuinness by name, his image appeared on screen as footage of the Queen’s visit was played. Yesterday’s message also saw the monarch admit that many felt ‘great disappointment’ after Scotland rejected independence – while others felt ‘great relief’. She added: ‘Bridging these differences will take time.’ Two years ago, the monarch shook hands with Mr McGuinness (left) when they met in Belfast for the first time . Mr McGuinness also enjoyed a private meeting in 2012 with the Queen, whose cousin Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979 . The Queen had strived to maintain a neutral position in the run-up to this year’s poll, but was quoted telling one voter near her Balmoral estate that Scots should ‘think very carefully about the future’ – widely interpreted as a plea to reject independence. Resplendent in a purple Angela Kelly dress, the Queen recorded her message next to a table displaying portraits of her grandparents George V and Queen Mary – the latter of whom passed down the diamond and pearl brooch pinned to her shoulder. The speech, recorded earlier this month in Buckingham Palace’s state dining room, also touched on the Christmas truce, which took place 100 years ago during the First World War and saw soldiers from both sides lay down their weapons, and meet between the trenches to play football. The Queen said: ‘Without any instruction or command, the shooting stopped.’ She later added: ‘Sometimes it seems that reconciliation stands little chance in the face of war and discord. But, as the Christmas truce a century ago reminds us, peace and goodwill have lasting power in the hearts of men and women.’ The Queen also turned to the religious significance of Christmas, describing how Jesus Christ was an ‘inspiration and an anchor in my life’ which has ‘taught me to seek to respect and value all people, of whatever faith or none’. Mr McGuinness acknowledges he is a former IRA member – but denies being part of its seven-man decision-making Army Council. In 1973 he was sentenced to six months in jail after being arrested near a car containing 250 pounds of explosives and nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition. He claims he left the IRA in 1974. The Queen’s table displayed an embossed brass box created for the Sailors & Soldiers Christmas Fund, which began in 1914. Princess Mary invited the public to help provide troops with Christmas gifts; by 1920, more than two million boxes were used to send presents from tobacco to chocolate.

"British Ebola survivor William Pooley has called for a global solution to the epidemic which has claimed more than 7,500 lives in this year's Alternative Christmas Message. The 29-year-old nurse from Suffolk became the first Briton to be evacuated from west Africa with the deadly disease and famously returned to work in Sierra Leone after making a full recovery. He said Ebola is unlike any other disease he has ever witnessed and said thousands have died 'lonely, miserable deaths' without access to proper medical attention. Mr Pooley follows in the footsteps of more controversial choices Edward Snowden, Ali G, and Sharon Osbourne in delivering Channel Four's answer to the Queen's message to the nation. Scroll down for video . British Ebola survivor William Pooley has called for a global solution to the epidemic which has claimed more than 7,500 lives . He said Ebola is unlike any other disease he has ever witnessed and said thousands have died 'lonely, miserable deaths' in this year's Alternative Christmas Message . In her speech later today, Queen Elizabeth will say she was 'deeply touched' by the 'selflessness' of medical staff and aid workers fighting the Ebola epidemic in her speech. Speaking from the Connaught hospital in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, Mr Pooley said: 'I don't want to make you feel guilty, but I would like you to think just for a few minutes about what you could do to help. 'This is a global problem and it will take the world to fix it. What a wonderful Christmas present that would be.' He contracted the deadly virus six weeks after he began working with Ebola patients in west Africa and was airlifted back to the UK for treatment in August this year. In her speech today, Queen Elizabeth will say she was 'deeply touched' by the 'selflessness' of medical staff and aid workers fighting the Ebola epidemic in her speech . The nurse told how he developed symptoms six weeks after starting work in Kenema government hospital, Sierra Leone. 'I was tested and later that day I awoke to find a colleague standing over me in protective gear. He told me I'd been infected with Ebola.' He said he was 'extremely fortunate' to be flown back to Britain for specialist treatment. 'My colleagues worked night and day to get me flown back to Britain for the best available treatment at the Royal Free in London. 'After I recovered I decided that I wanted to return to Sierra Leone and continue my work there as a nurse.' Wearing blue scrubs, Mr Pooley said his exposure to the disease reinforced his belief that when people need help it's important that it's given. 'Ebola is unlike any disease I've ever witnessed. Nothing can prepare you for the effect it has on the infected, on their families and on their communities. 'I realise I was incredibly lucky, lucky to be born in a wealthy country, lucky to be well-educated, lucky to have access to the best possible treatment for this awful disease.' He became the first Briton to be evacuated from west Africa with the deadly disease and famously returned to work in Sierra Leone after making a full recovery . He asked people to take a few minutes and ask themselves how they could help in fight against Ebola . But he said thousands of thousands of people in west Africa have not had that luck and died 'lonely, miserable deaths' without access to proper medical attention. 'If anything, Christmas should focus our minds on our kinship with people in all corners of the globe,' he said. 'We are all brothers and sisters. I'm sure we would all help a brother or sister in need.' The Alternative Christmas Message is designed to be a counterpoint to the Queen's speech, the theme of which is reconciliation. Today the head of state will tell viewers: 'I have been deeply touched this year by the selflessness of aid workers and medical volunteers who have gone abroad to help victims of conflict or of diseases like Ebola, often at great personal risk.' Last year Edward Snowden, who was behind the leak of documents revealing mass surveillance programmes, said that children born today would grow up with no conception of privacy. Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4's head of news and current affairs, said Pooley's speech is 'a message of love and hope which inspires'. My name's Will Pooley – I'm an NHS trained nurse. I come from a small village called Eyke in Suffolk. This is Connaught Hospital in Freetown the capital of Sierra Leone. Some of you may remember my name because in August this year I was the first Briton to be evacuated from west Africa with Ebola. As you can see I survived. Ebola is unlike any disease I've ever witnessed. Nothing can prepare you for the effect it has on the infected, on their families and on their communities. Six weeks after starting work in Kenema government hospital I developed symptoms. I was tested and later that day I awoke to find a colleague standing over me in protective gear. He told me I'd been infected with Ebola. In the end I was extremely fortunate. My colleagues worked night and day to get me flown back to Britain for the best available treatment at the Royal Free in London.

My exposure to this disease reinforced the belief that when people need help it's important that it's given. I realise I was incredibly lucky, lucky to be born in a wealthy country, lucky to be well educated, lucky to have access to the best possible treatment for this awful disease. Thousands of people here in west Africa have not had that luck. They have died often lonely, miserable deaths without access to proper medical attention. This is a good time to think about the sheer fortune of where and when we happen to be born. If anything Christmas should focus our minds on our kinship with people in all corners of the globe. We are all brothers and sisters. I'm sure we would all help a brother or sister in need. I don't want to make you feel guilty, but I would like you to think just for a few minutes about what you could do to help. This is a global problem and it will take the world to fix it. What a wonderful Christmas present that would be. So with that thought let me wish my family, my friends and all of you a very Merry Christmas and healthy and happy New Year.

"They’ve been spotted at the beach, by the back yard BBQ and cruising down main streets. Once a rare species, brush turkeys have made a remarkably bold comeback with their population increasing 700 per cent in the last 20 years in Brisbane, Queensland, alone. Now one top scientist has warned the red-necked game birds - also commonly known as bush and scrub turkeys - are heading for the expensive gardens of Sydney. Behavioural ecologist Professor Darryl Jones told the ABC there is nothing to stop the protected species which have taken over Brisbane and are now making their way south. 'We have a visitor!': Brush turkeys have made a remarkably bold comeback after once being a rare species . In Byron Bay, this brush turkey came over to investigate one beach goer's belongings . This turkey was spotted making a mess by one Instagram user, who wrote: 'That's a nice path. It'd be a shame if someone kicked mulch all over it' ‘I'm constantly getting reports from down in Sydney about “what the hell are we going to do about these big birds - they're destroying our gardens”, which we've known about for 30 years,’ he said. Professor Jones said despite the fact that they aren’t very smart, the birds are tough. ‘Sydney can expect an avalanche in the next 20 years of more and more brush turkeys because they love it – somehow or other they survive.’ A brush turkey jumped up onto a BBQ in one amused Aussie's back yard. 'Have you ever wondered what a bush turkey would be like on the BBQ? Well this guy just volunteered,' they wrote . At Australia Zoo a brush turkey wanders over to a woman and a kangaroo .

The bird, which has a mainly black body plumage, bare red head, yellow throat wattle, has been spotted along eastern Australia, from Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, south to the northern suburbs of Sydney and the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Bemused members of the public and bird lovers have shared their bizarre brush turkey sightings on social media. And as their population continues to expand, with female brush turkeys laying 20 to 30 eggs a year, experts have suggested those who want to avoid their garden being inhabited by the bird temporarily lay down chicken wire on their lawn if they spot one starting to dig.

"Consumers who shop for bargains at overseas stores online to avoid paying GST could soon see an end to cheaper prices, the government has announced. Tony Abbott’s new Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has revealed plans to review the tax exemption on goods bought overseas that are worth less than $1000, The Australian reports. If the exemption is scrapped, shoppers could see the online prices of household goods such as TVs, books, clothes and small electronic appliances like cameras shoot up. Scroll down for video . Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg (left), this week with Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Governor-General Peter Cosgrove and Assistant Minister for Education and Training Simon Birmingham . His announcement, which came on Boxing Day – the most important shopping day of the year - has been hailed as significant by The Australian Retailers Association, who have been lobbying to close the tax ‘loophole’ for over five years. Assistant Treasurer Frydenberg said the review of the tax-free status of goods purchased over the internet from international retailers was an ‘issue very much in the context of local jobs’ ‘You do want a relatively level playing field ... My sense is that we are seeing local retailers with one hand tied behind their backs,’ he told The Australian. Designer jeans and cosmetics are popular online purchases with Australians looking for a bargain . Goods purchased from online retailers that are worth less than $1000 are not subject to the goods and services tax. Australian retailers have for a long time complained that the GST loophole gives their overseas counterparts an unfair price advantage and have been lobbying state and federal governments to reduce the tax-free threshold. NAB estimates Australians spent $16.3 billion on online retail in the 12 months to November 2014. This level is equivalent to 6.8 per cent of spending at traditional bricks & mortar retailers as measured by the ABS (excluding cafés, restaurants and takeaway food) in the 12 months to October 2014. The Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that in the year 2012-2013, consumers travel, accommodation, memberships or tickets of any kind were the most common type of purchase for both males and females. The second most popular online shopping items for females were clothes, cosmetics or jewellery (59 per cent), in comparison to males second most popular purchases of CDs, music, DVDs, videos, books or magazines (50 per cent). Australian Retailers Association’s director Russell Zimmerman has welcomed the move . The Australian Retailers Association’s director Russell Zimmerman told Daily Mail Australia he feels confident that the government will take action against the tax exemption. ‘The remarks I’ve heard so far are quite strong. I think the government are quite concerned about the loss of revenue not being collected,’ Mr Zimmerman said. He said the LVIT loophole is costing thousands of retail jobs in Australia and that a further 33, 000 jobs will be lost in 2015 in the discretionary retail sector, having already lost 80,000 jobs since 2007. ‘The government is desperately in need of revenue; they’ve made that very clear.’ Mr Zimmerman explained that Australian shoppers are buying a huge range of products from international retailers online. ‘I think it’s virtually everything and anything… books are a big issue with imports from overseas. We have some very good online book sellers in Australia, why should they be penalised against the likes of Amazon or whoever it may be?’ ‘It’s time we saw some action,’ he added. The Abbott government is not the first to review the loophole; the most recent inquiry was in 2009. Australians purchase books and small electronic goods online for better rates . Australian retailers have for a long time complained that the GST loophole gives their overseas counterparts an unfair price advantage . Director of Campaigns and Communication at consumer advocacy group Choice, Matthew Levey, said that Mr Frydenberg’s announcement on Boxing Day was more a ‘restatement of where their position has been for a while.’ He explained the government has been reviewing how to impose a GST on overseas purchases in a way that doesn’t cost them more to implement than it would to do nothing. ‘We’ve yet to see any proposal on how you can put GST on small transactions that is cheaper than the money you are spending on people to collect it,’ he said. Mr Levey explained ‘if the issue here is about local retailers feeling uncompetitive, then we should look at what’s making them uncompetitive… we support the idea of a level playing field.’ ‘We don’t want to penalise consumers for no benefit,’ he added.","Goods currently purchased from online retailers overseas that are worth less than $1000 are not subject to the goods and services tax .

"They were reduced to tears when a somewhat harsh letter arrived from Santa notifying them about their inclusion on his naughty list. But after being given 13 sleeps to turn their behaviour around or risk a Christmas morning with no presents, brother and sister Tyler and Freya Cole awoke to find themselves in his good books. They were left ecstatic as they dashed out of their bedrooms and found that Santa had stuck to his word and rewarded their remarkable turnaround. Scroll down for video . After receiving a letter from 'Santa' saying they had to improve their behaviour if they wanted Christmas presents, Freya, 4, and Tyler Cole, 8, stopped squabbling . The pair, following a plan devised by their mother Laura, put their differences aside and were overjoyed to recieve presents on Christmas morning . The squabbling siblings put their differences aside having been warned in the missive from Lapland that Santa is ‘always watching’. Yet they did not realise that the letter was actually part of a ploy devised by their mother Laura to try and improve their behaviour in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The 32-year-old filmed the children’s tearful reaction as they opened the letter in which Santa described his disapproval of their naughty behaviour. Despite feeling guilty about the unusual approach and acknowledging that some people will brand her a ‘terrible mother’, Mrs Cole said the plan was a resounding success. Aside from a few minor blips, Tyler, eight, and Freya, four, managed to ‘work out their differences’ and even calmed each other down when normally chaotic situations began to unfold. The turnaround was obviously noticed by Santa, as Freya found herself the lucky recipient of an Elsa doll from Disney’s hit movie Frozen, the year’s most sought-after present. The siblings were reduced to tears when a somewhat harsh letter arrived from Santa notifying them about their inclusion on his naughty list . But Tyler was a picture of happiness this morning as he unwrapped a new Lego set left under the family's tree . Tyler was also left euphoric after opening his Lego ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ set, while both children were delighted by the array of gifts in their personalised stockings. And Santa himself even left his own letter this time in which he congratulated the children for making it on to his ‘nice list’ and urged them to continue being kind to each other. Mrs Cole, who works for ski tour operator Crystal, said that the magical Christmas morning after a visit from Santa was ‘really well deserved’ after a fortnight of hard work by her children. ‘They ran out of their room this morning and were so happy to see the presents,’ she said. ‘They weren’t overly naughty kids but they did fight a lot and this has really helped to work towards something together. ‘They have been getting so much better. When they were having their baths on Christmas Eve Tyler turned to Freya and said ‘He’s coming’ as he knew they had been good.’ Despite being criticised for penning the fake letter after she posted a video online of Tyler sobbing as he read it aloud, Mrs Cole said it was never meant to be cruel. Mrs Cole, who also lives with husband Dennis and one-year-old son Logan in Epsom, Surrey, said: ‘We didn’t want them to be sad or for this to be a negative thing. ‘It helps them appreciate the presents they got, rather than just assuming they are going to be there under the tree no matter what.’ ‘So we kept telling them about how good their behaviour had become over the last couple of weeks.’ But on the few occasions when the pair began to fight with each other, Miss Cole pointed to the letter which was kept on the mantelpiece and told the children that Santa was watching. ‘On some occasions, Tyler would even turn around to Freya and tell her off as he said Santa could see everything,’ Mrs Cole added. The video shows Tyler quivering as he reads out the message, which says that Santa is ‘certain’ they will be on his naughty list. The squabbling siblings put their differences aside having been warned in the missive from Lapland that Santa is ‘always watching’ Dear Tyler and Freya, . I have been watching you for the last few weeks and I am certain that you will both be on my naughty list. You have not been good children. I can see you have been fighting with each other and not treating each other well. This has made me feel extremely disappointed. I am also not impressed with the lack of listening you do Freya and the attitude you have at the moment Tyler. You have 13 sleeps to change this. I will be watching you both very very closely in a hope I can change you to the nice list. If you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents I have for you both. Remember only good children are on the nice list. I hope to see you on Christmas Eve. Santa Claus . ‘If you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents I have for you both,’ it warns. After reading the letter, a sobbing Tyler looks at his mother and cries: ‘What are you looking at us like that for? It makes me upset.’ When she responds by reminding him that he has 13 days to turn things around, the dispirited schoolboy says: ‘I know, but [Freya] keeps annoying me.’ The husband and wife have also decided to treat the children to a trip to Walt Disney World in February. With no threat from Santa over their heads, Miss Cole hopes they can use the holiday to keep working on the children’s sometime ill-discipline. She believes, however, that her successful fake letter ploy will lead to long-term harmony between the pair. She said: ‘They are a brother and sister who fight quite a lot, which is to be expected, and aren’t overly naughty. But in the last couple of weeks they seem to have worked out their differences.’","Tyler and Freya Cole received letter from 'Santa' they were on naughty list .

"PC Neil Doyle died after being attacked on the street during a work night out in Liverpool . Two more people have been arrested by police investigating the murder of newly wed policeman Neil Doyle who died after being attacked in the street. A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender on Christmas Eve, following the incident in Liverpool last Friday. Andrew Taylor, 28, and Christopher Spendlove, 30, were charged with the 36-year-old's murder earlier this week. Mr Doyle, who recently married, was on a work night out when he was assaulted. Police previously said they believed his attackers knew the officers were off-duty policemen. Last night a 24-year-old woman and 29-year-old man from Liverpool were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Mr Doyle married only five months ago and he and wife Sarah, 37, had booked a belated honeymoon for the new year. Mrs Doyle said in a statement: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all. 'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.' The couple were married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month. Speaking last week, Sir Jon Murphy, Merseyside's Chief Constable, said: 'Constable Doyle was enjoying a Christmas night out with his work colleagues. 'They were subjected to an apparently unprovoked and vicious attack by a group of males. 'There is no indication whatsoever that they were involved in any kind of argument or altercation earlier in the evening. 'The officer I have spoken to has indicated that the individuals who approached them referred to them as police officers. Investigation: The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am following the officers' Christmas party at a pub. Above, officers at the scene on Friday . Vicious: Bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive the man before paramedics arrived. A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. Above, officers at the scene .

A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. Sir Jon said the constable was a patrol officer who had served with the force for ten years. He had won a commendation for arresting three violent robbers.

"Medical experts are urging parents to be aware of the potential risks loom bands (pictured) pose after four children were taken to hospital in one week with loom bands stuck up their noses . Parents need to be more aware of the dangers of loom bands amid the potential for the popular accessory to become lodged in children's noses, a report has warned. Four children were treated at a Scottish hospital in just one week after the rubber bands became stuck, according to an article in the Journal of Laryngology & Otology. Loom bands - tiny loops of elastic in different colours that can be linked together to create low-cost jewellery such as necklaces and bracelets - have become something of a craze, with even the Duchess of Cambridge and pop star Harry Styles seen wearing them. But they have also been linked to a string of mishaps in which children have been hospitalised for injuries that include damaged eyesight. In a paper entitled Loom bands and young children - a tragedy waiting to happen? staff from the ENT Department at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie, said there had been a surge in the popularity of the bands recently, and urged people to be aware of the potential risks. In September, Kyle Lawrence, 7, was left with permanent sight damage after his brother accidentally flicked one of the popular bands into his eye while they were making a bracelet. The Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, youngster developed a cataract, which led to lasting muscle damage to his left eye. The report's authors said: 'Although the four cases presented were resolved without the need for general anaesthetic, the ever-soaring prevalence and popularity of loom bands necessitates a degree of caution and vigilance from parents, retailers and manufacturers alike. 'We believe there is an urgent need for greater public awareness of their potential hazards.' There is a risk of inhalation when objects become stuck in nasal passages, obstructing the airway, they added. In August one of the country's leading toy stores removed loom band charms from its shelves after they were found to contain potentially harmful chemicals. The Entertainer said the charms could contain phthalates, which can disrupt hormones in children. The chemicals, which are used to soften plastics, have been banned in toys on sale in the European Union for several years. The Duchess of Cambridge pictured wearing a loom band. The children's accessory has become hugely popular this year but has also been linked to a string of medical mishaps . Hospital treatment: Kyle Lawrence, of Cleethorpes, whose left eye was injured by a loom band bracelet . Manchester-based RMS International, which supplied the charms to The Entertainer, said the incident involved only a number of PVC loom charms, adding that loom bands are 'entirely safe'. The colourful rubber bands are woven together to make friendship bracelets and have been worn by high profile celebrities well as children. While a computer game can cost £40, 1,800 loom bands are as little as £2.50. They are already Amazon’s eighth best-selling toy of all time, after classics such as the Rubik’s Cube, Monopoly and Scrabble. Mark Lambert took this photo of his son Brandon, to show him how dangerous loom bands can be. The eight-year-old is pictured when two of his fingers went black after he fell asleep with loom bands wrapped around them . In July, eight-year-old Brandon Lambert's fingers went black after he fell asleep with the elastic bands wrapped around two digits. Fortunately, his father Mark checked on him half an hour after he fell asleep and removed them. The scare left the 36-year-old warning his son could have lost his fingers if the circulation of blood to his fingers had remained cut off. He said: ‘I don’t usually check on Brandon, but I am so glad I did. If the bands had stayed on his fingers all night then he might have had to get them amputated. The circulation had been completely cut off. ‘I took a picture quickly because I wanted to show Brandon how dangerous they can be. He was shocked when he saw the picture.’ The landscape gardener, who lives in Skipton, North Yorkshire, with his wife Donna, 32, a carer, added: ‘Brandon spends up to six hours a day at the weekend playing with loom bands, but nothing like this has happened before. ‘They are marketed as a fun and safe product but I don’t think they are. They are like elastic bands, and elastic bands are not child-friendly. They can be dangerous.’","Experts have urged parents to be more aware of hazards of loom bands .

"The traditional family Christmas took a back seat for many yesterday as millions of Britons spent a large chunk of the day online. Bargain-hunters spent around £441,000 a minute to set a 'Clickmas' record, racking up an estimated £636million sales. Up to 8 per cent of all adults hunted for bargains at some stage during the day. Many then cut short the family festivities to join the queues for the start of today's High Street sales. Thousands queued through the night for Boxing Day bargains, with some shopping centres opening at 6am. Scroll down for video . Bargain hunters spent an estimated £636million today, with around £441,000 being spent every minute . But that will not ease the rush for internet bargains. It is expected to be even busier online today, with spending predicted to hit £748million – or £515,000 per minute – 29 per cent up on Boxing Day last year. Retail spending figures suggest millions have delayed buying their presents for friends and family they did not see over Christmas in the hope of finding big bargains. Numbers visiting the High Street were down this month compared with last year. Even though retailers have slash prices by up to 90 per cent to shift stock, industry analysts fear Boxing Day could see the number of shoppers down by a third. Retail expert Julie Palmer, of business recovery experts Begbies Traynor, said: 'After a period of subdued High Street spending in the run up to Christmas, retailers who have underperformed and missed their peak trading targets will be discounting heavily today in a bid to draw in the crowds and make up for lost ground. 'The High Street retailers should still expect queues this morning, albeit at lower levels than what we would usually expect, as after two days holed up with the family, there's nothing quite like a bit of retail therapy. 'Shoppers can expect to find the largest discounts at the fashion retailers as, after an unseasonably warm end to the year, most clothing outlets have more surplus winter fashion items in stock than you would normally expect.' Experian Footfall says many who might have visited town centres today have already snapped up bargains from the comfort of their sofas as online sales began on Christmas Eve. Britain spends more online per head than any other nation, including the US, with retail spending online for 2014 forecast to top £100billion for the first time. More than £1 in every £5 of retail spending – other than food – is now online. Market research suggests that in some households online shopping has already become part of the festive tradition while families watch television and unwrap presents. Gift cards that allow shoppers to choose their own presents online have driven the popularity of Christmas Day internet shopping. Amazon said business on its site has grown fivefold in the past five years and eBay reported its busiest ever Christmas Day. The rise of e-readers and tablets has meant millions begin downloading books, music, films and TV box sets immediately after unwrapping Kindles and iPads. On Amazon, several deals sold out within hours, including a Rotary men's watch reduced from £450 to £74.99. On eBay, a £6.99 'selfie stick' – an extending pole allowing smartphone users to take better pictures of themselves – had sold out by 2pm. The site also proved a popular way to sell unwanted gifts, with a handheld window-cleaning Hoover listed with the comment: 'Just did not want this present.' eBay predicts that 2.7million users will sell unwanted gifts worth £819million on the site. Coffee machines and cameras are being sold at half-price on eBay alongside a plethora of discounted goods . A PS4 console is also being sold on the online auctioneer with a discount of £30 . Millions will take to the High Street tomorrow to make the most of the traditional Boxing Day sales . Analysts IMRG and Experian predicted that 142 million people would visit online shopping websites throughout Christmas Day. Marks and Spencer launched its sale with 50 per cent off a range of homeware, furniture and clothing. Among the most discounted items is a £999 sofa reduced to £499 and kitchen sets. Amazon started offering discounts from 4pm, with traffic expected to peak shortly after 9pm tonight. On eBay, sellers have slashed prices by up to 50 per cent, with savings also available on coveted gadgets such as a Playstation 4, reduced by £50 to £359.99. The online auctioneer is also selling a range of Apple iPads for £329.99 - a discount of 17 per cent - and Phillips coffee machines for £50. Half of consumers polled by Barclaycard in the run-up to Christmas said they would do some online shopping today. Giles Longhurst, consumer insight general manager at Experian Marketing Services, said: 'The ease of shopping online via connected devices raises the prospect of a very large amount of shopping activity on Christmas Day itself. 'We expect a 25 per cent growth on last year in the number of site visits to 142 million as shoppers slip away from families to do some additional bargain hunting on the big day, with a corresponding spend of £636million. Dominic Trigg, managing director for Europe of digital advertising technology company Rocket Fuel, said: 'Shopping online on Christmas Day is now a normal part of UK consumers' holiday experiences every year. 'This year spending on the day will increase 36% compared to 2013, taking it to an estimated £636 million. 'It is clear that UK consumers now see shopping from the comfort of their own home, following Christmas Day dinner, as much of a tradition as a turkey and ham dinner.' Crowds of bargain hunters at Westifled shopping centre in west London on Boxing Day last year on one of the busiest shopping days of the year . John Lewis said last week's sales of £160.6 million, up 6.5 per cent on the previous week, confirmed its expectation that customers were choosing to leave their Christmas shopping until the last minute. The department store's retail director, Andrew Murphy, said: 'Last week we said it's all to play for and that is still absolutely the case as we have seen a building trend of customers leaving their gift purchases right up until the last minute. 'Busy though our shops have been over the past week, it's only in these final pre-Christmas days that many customers are finally moving to complete their gift buying and other purchases. 'Consequently our partners are standing ready for a very busy final trading day before the festive break.' Millions will hit the High Street tomorrow for the traditional Boxing Day sales, however. Queues formed outside luxury London department stores Selfridges and Harrods last year, with the majority of customers eager to snap up the best deal travelling from abroad.","Shoppers spent around £440,000 a minute throughout Christmas Day .

"Torrid conditions have taken a toll on the smaller boats on the opening night of the Sydney to Hobart race. New American flyer Comanche was leading three of her fellow super maxis, while Comanche, which impressively won the early dash to be first through Sydney Heads, was around two nautical miles ahead of seven-times line honours winner Wild Oats XI. Two other supermaxis, Perpetual LOYAL and Ragamuffin 100, were a further three-and-a-half and six miles adrift, respectively. Thousands of people lined the Sydney Harbour foreshore and hundreds of spectator boats were on hand for the countdown to the 70th blue water classic. Scroll down for video .

Supermaxi Wild Oats XI is favourite to take line honours again this year, but will face stiff competition from 100-footers Perpetual Loyal (front), Ragamuffin and American yacht Comanche . The fifth supermaxi, RIO 100, struggled in the heavy conditions and was lagging in eighth, with Giacomo, Black Jack and Alive, filling fifth to seventh spots, respectively. Of the retired yachts, 1997 line honours winner Brindabella was the biggest boat and highest profile casualty. Barely two hours had elapsed before news of the first casualties emerged. Sydney-based boats Bear Necessity (rudder damage) and Accessional Coarse Language Too (steering damage) and Victorian yacht Tina of Melbourne (hull damage) were among the first wave of stricken vessels to stop racing. Triton (forestay damage), Wiilyama (torn mainsail), Brindabella and Last Tango (sail damage) were later additions to the mounting list. While the southerlies were expected to lash the fleet throughout the night, significantly higher conditions were forecast to arrive at some stage of Saturday morning. Among the early frontrunners on handicap were British 68-footer Titania of Cowes, NSW 40-footer Ariel and New Zealand Volvo 70 boat Giacomo.

The Queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, spent Friday morning before the race at the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia. She lead a contingent of celebrities who also gathered to farewell competitors as the Boxing Day countdown to the 1pm race start drew closer. Surfing champ Sally Fitzgibbons was front and centre after being asked to sail on board Perpetual LOYAL with owner and skipper Anthony Bell. They were farewelled at a special event at Rose Bay Marina on Friday morning. Anthony Minichello and wife Terry Biviano were among those who soaked up the sunny and hot weather with their daughter Azura. Olympic swimmer Geoff Huegill and television host Larry Emdur were also in attendance. Other 'supersailors' alongside Sally Fitzgibbons include boxer Danny Green, Olympic sailor Tom Slingsby, rugby union player Phil Waugh, chef Guillaume Brahimi. Crew safety came first as Victorian yacht Tina of Melbourne became the first yacht to pull out of the Sydney to Hobart race. The 37-footer which was just off Bondi when the crew discovered a problem with her hull leaking after sustaining damage in rough conditions outside Sydney Heads. 'We fell off probably a metre and a half, two-metre wave,' skipper Andy Doolan said. Hi-tech American supermaxi Comanche reached the first turning mark in just four minutes and 35 seconds, which is believed to be a record . Thousands of people lined the Sydney Harbour foreshore and hundreds of spectator boats were on hand to see off the yachts taking part in the 70th blue water classic . Thousands of people watched on to farewell the yachts through the Sydney heads . A 15-knot southerly breeze was forecast for the start of the race and it's tipped to reach 20-28knots by Friday afternoon . 'We noticed a bit of water ingress, so at that point I notified the crew.' 'They were all okay, there was no imminent danger. I switched the pumps on and noticed that we couldn't fix the problem there and then so I made the decision to retire.' 'Our number one priority was the safety of the crew. There was no point continuing on.' Three other boats - Bear Necessity (rudder), Occasional Coarse Language (steering) and Willyama (main sail) - also withdrew in the first four hours. Another early casualty was a crew member aboard Last Tango, who was being dropped off at Botany Bay after suffering a hernia issue. At the front, Comanche was reined in by three of her supermaxi rivals after making a scintillating start that made her the talk of the race. The high-tech, red and black hulled boat owned by Netscape co-founder Jim Clark and his Australian wife Kristy Hinze-Clark rounded the first mark in an unofficial record time of four minutes and 35 seconds, 35 seconds ahead of seven-times line honours winner Wild Oats X1. Wild Oats skipper Mark Richards could only marvelled at the early pace of his boat's newest challenger as she raced clear up Sydney Harbour. 'She's smoking. Look at that thing go!' exclaimed Richards. Another awed by Comanche's blazing start was 91-year-old Geoff Ruggles, the oldest survivor of the first Sydney to Hobart race in 1945. 'I have a sense of wonderment about the technological advances and the development of this boat Comanche,' Ruggles said. However, Comanche skipper Ken Read deflected credit for the hot start and wasn't reading too much into it so early in the 620-nautical mile race. 'The crew pulled the trigger just right,' said Read. 'But you don't get any awards for the start.' The American veteran said his boat was coping well with the tougher conditions encountered later in the day. Olympic swimmer Geoff Huegill joined the crew farewelling Perpetual LOYAL at a special event at Rose Bay Marina on Friday morning . Other 'supersailors' alongside Sally Fitzgibbons include boxer Danny Green, Olympic sailor Tom Slingsby, rugby union player Phil Waugh, chef Guillaume Brahimi . 'It's a little bumpy, but the boat is handling the weather quite well,' Read said. 'We're at (winds of) 23 to 26 knots and we're pushing hard, looking good.' While the boats on all three start lines appeared to get away cleanly, former line honours winner Brindabella made a 720-degree turn, though organisers were unsure why. The fleet were expected to encounter some more strong southerly breezes on Friday night before a forecast lightening of conditions some time on Saturday morning. This year, yachts lined up on three start lines because of the large number of boats taking part. Sydney to Hobart newcomer Comanche made the most impressive start by a race rookie in memory, blitzing the fleet to be first out of the Sydney Heads. The hi-tech American supermaxi reached the first turning mark in just four minutes and 35 seconds, which is believed to be a record. She beat seven-times line honours winner Wild Oats X1 by 35 seconds with Syd Fischer's Ragamuffin 100 third and Anthony Bell's Perpetual LOYAL fourth. Supermaxi Wild Oats XI is favourite to take line honours again this year, but will face stiff competition from 100-footers Perpetual Loyal, Ragamuffin and American yacht Comanche.

"Big brown eyes, a wagging tail – and a nose so keen it strikes fear into drug smugglers far and wide.Megan, the most successful sniffer dog ever, has capped off her career with her 100th find. Now, after detecting £30million of cocaine – some 220kg (485lb) – in seven years on the job, the record-breaking springer spaniel is getting ready to retire. Border Force Springer Spaniel Megan, 8, who is based at Gatwick Airport, is the most successful drug detection dog ever. Scroll down for video . Border Force Springer Spaniel Megan, 8, who is based at Gatwick Airport, is the most successful drug detection dog ever . Only months from retirement, this week she made her 100th find – more than any other dog. On the streets, the 220kg cocaine she detected would have a street value of more than £30million. Her handlers say the secret of her success is her unusually large nose and long muzzle. Alan Thorpe, Dog Unit Team Leader said: ‘She is by far the most successful drugs sniffer dog ever. Getting 100 finds is an amazing achievement, and it’s never been done before.’ Megan’s handler is Steven Martin, 29, from Sidcup. She lives with 12 other dogs at a top secret location near Gatwick Airport. Away from work she is, he says, a sensitive dog, with a gentle personality. But when he puts her harness on, she is transformed. It is, Steve says, a ‘superhero-type thing’. Megan's handler is Steven Martin, 29, says the secret of her success is her unusually large nose and long muzzle . ‘When she is out and about here being her normal self she can be quite sensitive.  But when she’s working she is indestructible. ‘When she wants to find the drugs, there’s nothing that will get in her way. Once she puts her harness on she has these powers and she goes off and does what she has to do.’ When she finds the scent, Megan will indicate at the strongest point of smell with a ‘freeze stare’, focused on it with her eyes and nose. Such is her sense of smell, she can even smell cocaine dissolved inside another liquid in a bottle, or the sweat of cocaine on the hands and feet of smugglers who have swallowed – or otherwise deposited the drugs inside their body. Mystery surrounds her birth and origins – she came from the Metropolitan Police but before that it is unclear. Her relationship with Steve did not get off to the most auspicious of starts. ‘She rolled over and weed on me,’ he said. But from that point on, they’ve never looked back. In their first year, sniffer dogs in training are not expected to make even one find; Megan made ten. Since then, she’s broken every record going. Megan was a protégée of the now retired Badger, another Springer Spaniel, who retired in 2007. A picture of Badger hangs in the headquarters of the sniffer dogs near Gatwick Airport. Its inscription reads: Badger: ‘A Gatwick Legend’ 2001-2007. He made 82 finds. The sniffer dog base is in a secret location, unmarked from the road, and hidden from view by trees. Security is taken seriously: some years ago the name of a dog – now retired – was found by the FBI at the home of a notorious drug baron in South America. The animal – which has not been identified – had been put on a hit list, and had a price on its head, because it had intercepted a particularly large consignment of drugs. And a few months ago there was a scare when a dog died. There were fears an organised crime gang operating in the airport might have slipped the dog a poisoned biscuit. A full investigation was carried out and suspicions were allayed – the animal died of intestinal problems and hadn’t been poisoned. At the base the dogs live in relative luxury – under overhead lamps and heat reflective floors. In the pack, Megan isn’t the top dog, Steve says, but doesn’t get in to scraps. ‘Everyone gets on with Megan – she is very popular,’ he says. For six months she went off the boil – and Steve was worried she might be slowing down because of her age. But after a visit to the dentist she bounced back to life. The problem had been a rotting tooth giving her toothache. Now coming to the end of her working life, you would expect her work ethic to have eased off. But not a bit of it, Steve says. The only day she allows herself a lie-in, he says, is when she’s not working. ‘Even at eight she is really active, a real pro. She wakes up in the morning with the rest, but if she sees it’s not me then she will go back to bed.’ Around the airport, Megan is something of a celebrity – having appeared on a series of documentaries set in and around the airport. ‘People are always recognising her,’ says Steve. I just drive her around now and let her get on with the job. People say I’m just her driver.’ He admits that, when her last day comes – expected to be within months – it will be an emotional day. ‘To see her be so successful, to go after seven years, it’s going to be a bit upsetting,’ he says. ‘She has done me proud’. ‘It’s going to be a tough transition’. ‘She’s doing it for herself but she is also doing it for me – because I’ve asked her, and that’s the bond coming through.’ When her retirement day comes, she will go home with Steve and live with him or, when he’s at work, with his parents. ‘She has been an amazing dog. She knows exactly what to do. I can take a step back and let her get on with it. I never have to gee her up. ‘I will miss her when she goes. It’s going to be an emotional day to see her go. She is one of the greats.’","Border Force Springer Spaniel Megan, 8, made her 100th find this week .

"The last voyage of the world's oldest surviving clipper ship is to be revealed in a new book. The City of Adelaide transported thousands of settlers from Europe to Australia in the 19th century before ending up in Irvine, North Ayrshire. Scottish author Rita Bradd was granted exclusive access to accompany the 150-year-old ship on its final 14,000-mile journey around the globe. The last voyage of the world's oldest surviving clipper ship will be revealed in a new book . Scottish author Rita Bradd was granted exclusive access to accompany the 150-year-old ship on its final 14,000-mile journey . She was given permission to join the crew of the cargo ship MV Palanpur, which carried the clipper from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to its final resting place in Port Adelaide in South Australia, where it arrived safely earlier this year. The tall-ships enthusiast kept a diary in tandem with that of a young woman who made the maiden voyage in 1864, charting the ups and downs of the trip - from spending Christmas Day on the equator to surviving a cyclone. The journey marked the culmination of the latest chapter in the 450-tonne clipper's eventful life. Researchers estimate that a quarter of a million South Australians can trace their origins back to passengers who travelled on the City of Adelaide. Its sailing days ended in 1893 but in later years it was used as a hospital ship, renamed Carrick as a training boat and a clubhouse, and was raised and kept on a slipway at Scottish Maritime Museum in Irvine after sinking in the River Clyde in 1991. Charitable organisation Clipper Ship City of Adelaide led a successful campaign to save and relocate the boat to become part of a new maritime heritage park in South Australia. Rita Bradd with open arms with City of Adelaide on Bradley Barge . The historic 'City of Adelaide' clipper ship on board the heavy lift ship MV Palanpur, docked at Port Adelaide in Adelaide . Charitable organisation Clipper Ship City of Adelaide led a successful campaign to save and relocate the boat . The group beat a rival bid from campaigners in Sunderland where the ship was built. Mrs Bradd, whose book will include the stories of many of those who have been involved with the clipper over the years, recalled the 'huge sadness' of the day the boat left Scotland bound for Greenwich in south east London and on to Rotterdam. She said: 'The ship is a people's ship. She's just got such an amazing presence. 'She's done so many interesting things in her life and she's lived through all these hardships. She just captivates people's imaginations. 'It's an incredible story, not just my part in it, but the whole ship and the people who have been involved with her and the passion that bubbles out from everybody.' Researchers estimate that a quarter of a million South Australians can trace their origins back to passengers who travelled on the City of Adelaide . The 70-day voyage took her from Rotterdam to Norfolk in Virginia, US, and on to Port Hedland, Western Australia, via the Cape of Good Hope . The 70-day voyage took her from Rotterdam to Norfolk in Virginia, US, and on to Port Hedland, Western Australia, via the Cape of Good Hope, following the historic route the ship would have taken in its heyday. Recalling the final and most precarious leg of the journey, Mrs Bradd said: 'We hit the tail end of a cyclone and it was really wild. 'I quite like a bit of a thrill but that was just a little bit scary and I did think 'Am I ever going to see my family again?'. I really did. Mrs Bradd has pledged to give a percentage of what she makes from the book towards the City of Adelaide . 'I was always imagining what it would have been like being inside the ship in storm-force winds, it must have been awful. 'When I saw the land, I was so relieved. I was overcome with joy at the safe arrival of the ship and for that wonderful engineering experience to have been such a success. 'It's a fantastic thing that she has been saved and she looks great out there.' Mrs Bradd has pledged to give a percentage of what she makes from the book towards the City of Adelaide in the future. 'She's given me this wonderful experience and you can't not give something back,' she said.","The City of Adelaide is the oldest surviving clipper ship .

"Brits have revealed the worst Christmas presents they have ever received including a car exhaust, maggots and a can of spam. A poll of 2,000 people found that the 'awful gifts' were all panicky last minute buys from 'loved ones'. Other dreadful items to grace a list of the Top Ten Worst Gifts were a jar of pickled gherkins, a loaf of bread and a packet of bean sprouts. Scroll down for video . And the winner is! A poll of 2,000 people by Barclays revealed a can of spam to be the worst Christmas present received by a Brit . The poll was compiled by Barclays, which found that ten per cent of Brits leave buying some of their gifts until Christmas Day and end up popping out to the local petrol station for a last minute present. David Jarman, 31, of Chesham, Bucks, said: 'If I got a can of spam or a car exhaust for Christmas I would take back the presents I'd bought them. 'Christmas is about thinking of other people, not buying stuff that nobody wants or that you can find in the kitchen cupboard, or under your car.' Barclays bosses said it had come up with a solution for those who forget to buy a present, saying they can get gift vouchers - for stores such as Debenhams, Cineworld, iTunes and Nintendo - 'pinged' to their phones on Christmas Day. Close runners: A jar of pickled gherkins came in at third in the Top Ten Worst Presents, while maggots as a gift ranked at number nine . Darren Foulds, Managing Director of Barclays Mobile Banking and Pingit, said this week: 'Busy lives and a desire to avoid the crowds mean it's no surprise that many people leave their present shopping to the last minute. A poll compiled by Barclays revealed the most dreadful Christmas presents Brits have ever received. Here are ten of the worst: . 1. Can of Spam . 2. Car exhaust . 3. Jar of pickled gherkins . 4. Loaf of bread . 5. Packet of bean sprouts . 6. Extension lead for a garden mower . 7. 20 feet of chain . 8. Hoover bags . 9. Maggots . 10. Stepladder . 'Thankfully while a petrol station may have traditionally been the only option for frantic shoppers, consumers can now use their mobile or tablet to buy last minute Christmas gifts in time for the big day. 'Since its launch consumers have used Barclays Pingit to send money quickly and safely, but can now also choose from a range of fantastic gifts including experience days, gift cards, subscriptions and iTunes services - which mean it's even easier to send thoughtful, last minute gifts for friends and family.' With so many Brits claiming they have received terrible Christmas gifts - many have had to learn how to master their present-opening face. MailOnline recently met Dr Simon Moore, a chartered psychologist with the British Psychological Society, to discover the verbal and physical signs that reveal what people really think of their present. The good news for those worried about their acting skills, said Dr Moore, is that spotting fake happiness is quite hard, with the detection rate for the average person being around 40 to 50 per cent. This is handy - as a recent survey by eBay revealed that 59% of people are steeling themselves to feign delight if they unwrap presents they don’t want this today . Last-minute buys: Among the Top Ten Worst Gifts, a car exhaust came second, while an extension lead for a garden mower ranked sixth . 'Awful gifts': A packet of bean sprouts was voted the fifth worst present on the list, while a stepladder came in at number ten . Dr Moore says a select few will be able to correctly see through around seven or eight out of 10 attempts to fake joy. The trick to up your detection rate, said Dr Moore, is never to look for one or two signals, but a cluster of them. These include agitation, the freezing of the face, touching the face and shaking the head, leaning away from the gift and smiling unnaturally.","Poll of 2,000 Brits found last minute 'awful gifts' people have received .

"Shocking details have emerged which suggest one of the two men arrested in counter terrorism raids on Tuesday allegedly planned to kill people at random in the Blue Mountains. The National Security Committee was told about the alleged attacks as part of a briefing on the men's broader terror plans shortly before they approved the Australian Federal Police's raids in Sydney's west. It is thought that one of the men had planned to carry out guerrilla warfare in the Blue Mountains region - just outside Sydney - targeting and killing random people in the area's bushland, reports the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . It has been alleged a Sydney jihadist had planned to carry out random attacks in the Blue Mountains, NSW . Sulayman Khalid, pictured on the SBS Insight program, has been charged with allegedly possessing documents outlining 'potential Federal and State government entities for an attack' Sulayman Khalid is pictured here during a court appearance earlier this year . The two men arrested during the terror raids have both been charged and refused bail. One of the men previously stormed off the set of a television program while wearing an Islamic State symbol. Sulayman Khalid has been placed behind bars after he was charged with possessing documents listing potential targets for a terrorist attack. Khalid, 20, from Regents Park in Sydney's west, was formally refused bail in Parramatta Local Court. The Marsfield man, who cannot be named, was charged with breaching a Control Order. He was refused bail after a magistrate deemed him an 'unacceptable risk to the community'. The arrests followed raids around 1.30pm last Thursday where police seized a large number of documents outlining possible Federal and State government targets, a rifle and two shotguns. Deputy NSW Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said the men were arrested as part of an ongoing investigation into an apparent ring of 15 to 20 people. She said 11 people have been charged so far under the counter-terrorism operation, known by the codename Appleby. The same investigation conducted the largest raids in the nation's history on September 18, which involved more than 800 NSW and Federal Police. AFP Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan told reporters the men shared the 'ideology' of the Islamic State terror group. 'It is a group of people here in Sydney who we've been actively monitoring for a long time,' he said. 'Certainly their ideology is linked to [Islamic State].' Adam Houda, Khalid's lawyer, told Daily Mail Australia his client has been charged with a very serious offence. 'But I want to remind you that the authorities have got it wrong in the past many times,' Mr Houda said. 'I ask that the court process be respected and for this matter to be determined on the evidence and not by politicians and the media.' A 21-year-old man was arrested for breaching a Control Order . The largest terror raids in the nation's history were conducted earlier this year . Under the name Abu Bakr, Khalid appeared on the SBS program Insight earlier this year for a forum about the Federal government's cancellation of terror suspect's passports. The part-time labourer had his passport suspended last December. He stormed off the set after facing a grilling over his support for the Islamic State terror group. In a separate hearing, prosecutors alleged today that the Marsfield man breached the conditions of his control order by using a public telephone and a mobile phone which did not belong to him in the space of an hour on Monday evening. His lawyer, Arjun Chhabra, told the court the mobile belonged to his mother and said his age should be taken into consideration. Today's arrests follow an extraordinary pre-Christmas message from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, where he warned a terrorist attack remains 'likely'. 'The briefing from the security agencies today indicated there has been a heightened level of terrorist chatter in the aftermath of the Martin Place siege,' he said. He said security agencies would be 'highly visible' as the nation moves into the festive season. On December 15, crazed gunman Man Haron Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Martin Place cafe. Barrister Katrina Dawson, hospitality worker Tori Johnson and Monis were killed on Tuesday morning as the siege came to a bloody end.

David Jones chief Iain Nairn said in the first five hours, his stores had raked in just over $4.4 million. Mr Nairn said the most popular items by far were designer handbags, with early bird shoppers buying up bags marked down by 80 per cent. Tony Sutton, Myer executive general manager, could not confirm sales figures but said crowds were the biggest the department store had seen in 10 years. 'We had up to a thousand lining up before 5am – the first customers lined up at 7.30pm last night,' Mr Sutton said. But some shoppers in Myer's Bourke Street Mall store in Melbourne were left disappointed after misleading handwriting on vouchers led them to think they had been gifted a $201 voucher when it was only valid for $20, the Herald Sun reported.

Mr Sutton said the most popular items so far had been menswear, with the store selling 50 business shirts a minute. He added that ladies shoes and heavily discounted Christmas decorations and wrapping were also selling quickly. Australian National Retailers Association chief Anna McPhee said consumer confidence was on the rise. If Boxing Day sale predictions come true Australian shoppers will splurge more than $2 billion . Shops around the country will take in more than $16 billion over the next three weeks . 'Cheap petrol prices particularly are putting extra dollars in people's wallets,' Ms McPhee said. 'Low interest rates across the year have also been boosting household budgets.' Retailers expect shops around the country will take in more than $16 billion over the next three weeks, including a $2.072 billion boon on Boxing Day alone. If so, it would be the first time Australian shoppers have spent more than $2 billion in a single day.

ARA executive director Russell Zimmerman slammed 'ludicrous' retail regulations in New South Wales (NSW) preventing shops outside the city's CBD from opening their doors early on Boxing Day. 'NSW is Australia's most populous state, and yet Victoria easily takes the cake when it comes to expected Boxing Day sales,' Mr Zimmerman said on Thursday. 'This equals a $98 million loss of trade to NSW retailers, with absurd and outdated trading restrictions largely to blame.' 'Consumers can buy online 24/7 but many bricks and mortar stores are still unable to open on, what is for many, the largest trading day of the year.' Australian shoppers aged 14 or older will spend an average of $850 each between Boxing Day and January 15.

Shehzad Masih and Shama Bibi - who was four months at the time - were viciously beaten by a mob and then thrown in a brick kiln, witnesses said. Jill Kelley, right, said she was horrified when she learned that three children had been orphaned after their Christian parents, Shehzad Masih and Shama Bibi, left, were brutally murdered . The Florida socialite has revealed that she has arranged for a house to be built for the orphaned 18-month-old Ponam, Sonan Rani, 4, and Salman, 6, who are being cared for by their grandfather . The killing was sparked by the mob's belief that Shama Bibi had desecrated a copy of the Koran. By the time the attack was over, only charred bones and the couple's discarded shoes remained. More than 50 people have been arrested in connection with the incident which took place in Chak 59 - a village situated in Kasur district, 60 kilometers from Pakistan's second largest city Lahore. Kelley, who has worked with the U.S. Central Command on interfaith and alliances, contacted a Catholic priest in the  region who helped her find a house for the children who are currently being cared for by their grandfather, reports the New York Post. 'I personally paid for the house and we have just gone into contract. Nothing will bring their parents back, but if I can help these children and do something to provide for their future at Christmas then it is worth it.' Kelley received global media attention for triggering the investigation that revealed that intelligence chief Petraeus was having an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell. 'My life has changed drastically because of everything that has happened, but I believe there is a silver lining, and if I need to use my notoriety to bring awareness to humanitarian issues in the world, I will do that,' she said. Kelley received global media attention for triggering the investigation that revealed that intelligence chief Petraeus, left, was having an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, right . Kelley, whose uncle is a Syrian Catholic leader, also joined a private audience with Pope Francis last week along with Catholic bishops from Middle Eastern nations to discuss the genocide of Christians in the region. She is attempting to rehabilitate her reputation which took a battering following the Petraeus scandal. In September she was informed that she can pursue a lawsuit which claims the government invaded her privacy during the scandal. Kelley claims the FBI and Defense Department violated her privacy when officials leaked damaging information about her to the media. In 2012, Kelley, who has friends in military circles, complained to the bureau when an anonymous individual sent her harassing emails. Kelley also joined a private audience with Pope Francis last week along with Catholic bishops from Middle Eastern nations to discuss the genocide of Christians in the region . Her concerns triggered an investigation that led agents to Broadwell, who was romantically involved with the married Petraeus at the time. However, after a search of her emails, the bureau publicly announced that she had 'inappropriate' email conversations with General John Allen - even though she is married. She claims that agents deliberately leaked her name to the public and then released the correspondences to insinuate an affair between them and smear her name. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Kelley could sue government officials in a move that could reveal more information about the scandal that unfolded two years ago. Court filings by her lawyers claim the government falsely told one news outlet the emails between Allen and Kelley were the equivalent of phone sex. Mrs Kelley was forced into hiding after the allegations were disclosed. She has only recently spoken out about how she feels it was unjust for her to be forced into a defensive position even though she believes she did nothing wrong. Kelley, with her cancer surgeon husband Scott at her side, has fought back against the federal government for releasing her name in connection to the Broadwell investigation and further insinuating an inappropriate connection to General Allen . All of the parties involved in the tumultuous scandal- Petraeus, Broadwell, Allen and Kelley - were all married to other people, but Kelley claims that Petraeus and Broadwell were the only two that had a romantic relationship. Mrs Kelley, with her cancer surgeon husband Scott at her side, fought back against the federal government for releasing her name in connection to the Broadwell investigation and further insinuating an inappropriate connection to General Allen. She served as a volunteer civilian liaison to MacDill Air Force Base, where Petreaus and his wife had been stationed when he served as head of the military's Central Command. Petreaus struck up a friendship with Kelley, but Broadwell feared he was having an affair with her, as well. The married intelligence chief resigned from his position as Director of the CIA in November 2012, citing his extramarital affair.","Mother-of-three Kelley has bought a home for three children tragically orphaned in Pakistan last month .

"Brendan Rodgers has a riddle to solve: how does he keep Liverpool one of the most potent sides in Europe without one of the best players in the world? Slowly but surely, we are starting to see the answer he will provide. Moving on without Luis Suarez, the man who provided 31 goals last season and perpetual threat, is going to be a challenge but that is not to say Liverpool will stall without him. Pace and penetration from all areas is what Rodgers wants to see from his side in the new campaign, with the goals and threat being shared out and at times during their latest friendly – a 1-0 win over Olympiacos, secured by Raheem Sterling’s goal – you saw how it might all fit together. VIDEO Scroll down for Rodgers saying scoring not a problem without Suarez . On target: Raheem Sterling prods the ball beyond Balazs Megyeri to give Liverpool an early lead . You beauty: Sterling wheels away as Liverpool fans celebrate his goal . On top: Brendan Rodgers named a strong side but his charges did not play to their full potential . Mixed emotions: Megyeri angrily boots the ball upfield as Sterling is congratulated by debutant Lazar Markovic, Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge . Thwarted: Megyeri uses all of his wits to deny Sturridge from close range . VIDEO Scoring not a problem without Suarez - Rodgers . Liverpool: Jones, Johnson (Kelly 62), Skrtel, Toure (Coates 62), Enrique (Robinson 45), Gerrard (Lucas 62), Henderson, Can (Allen 45), Sterling (Ibe 75), Markovic (Coutinho 45), Sturridge (Lambert 75). Subs: Ward, Coady Peterson . Goal: Sterling 5 . Olympiacos: Megyeri, Abidal, Papadopolous, Siovas, Do Carmo, Ghazaryan, Maniatis, N'Dinga, Diamantakos, Dossevi, Saviola . First . Rodgers had Steven Gerrard dropping deep, acting like a quarterback in a . stadium synonymous with American football. To his sides, Emre Can and . Jordan Henderson provided energy, while up front Daniel Sturridge, Lazar . Markovic and Sterling kept Liverpool explosive. There . will, inevitably, be adjustments made to this line-up before their new . campaign begins on August 17, not least as a new £20million defender in . Dejan Lovren needs to slot in, but this might just have been a glimpse . of the Liverpool of the future. Clearly, . it is impossible to say at such an early stage whether this new look . squad will be superior to the group Suarez inspired before his . £75m sale to Barcelona, but Rodgers unquestionably has a plan, one . that he believes will keep Liverpool on the front foot. That . is how they started their campaign in the grandly titled Guinness . International Tournament; Olympiacos couldn’t contain them in the . opening 10 minutes, as Sterling, Markovic and Sturridge scurried . forward, constantly running beyond the Greek defence. Block tackle: Steven Gerrard launches himself at Ionnis Maniatis' shot as Martin Skrtel looks on . Midfield battle: Markovic comes under pressure from Do Carmo Salino in Chicago . High jump: Skrtel and Dimitrios Diamantakos go for the ball . Determination: Glen Johnson battles with Gevorg Ghazaryan for possession . Clearing his lines: All eyes are on Megyeri as he thwarts a Liverpool attack . Sterling . opened the scoring after five minutes, dashing into the danger zone to . feed on the scraps after Sturridge, who had been set free by Gerrard, . scuffed a shot that cannoned off Eric Abidal and fell invitingly at the . England forward’s feet. A . few more goals should have followed before half-time. Liverpool have . only been in training for three weeks – some of this starting line-up . only returned last Monday – but they looked sharper and more nimble than . their opponents in the stifling 28 degree heat. First . Markovic sped inside two tackles before curling his shot over the bar; . next Henderson almost burst through after Sterling and Markovic had . impressively combined, while Gerrard fired a series of dangerous set . plays into the area. Olympiakos, . by contrast, offered no threat and their physical approach was . illustrated by the fact Dimitris Siovas and Do Carmo Salino were booked . for crude challenges. Javier Saviola, meanwhile, was shown a yellow card . after he dived to win a penalty. As . is always the case with these games, a raft of changes followed in the . second half. Olympiacos almost found a way back into the match, when . Gevorg Ghazaryan cracked a drive against the crossbar in the 50th minute . but that was the only scare Liverpool had. If . anything, they had more opportunities to win. The best fell to Rickie . Lambert, whose right-footed drive in the 75th minute was beaten away by . Olympiacos keeper Balazs Megyeri, while Philippe Coutinho found the . side-netting with a powerful effort from 20 yards. Denied: Dimitris Siovas challenges Sturridge as Eric Abidal watches on . A meeting of minds: Real Madrid legend Michel and Brendan Rodgers share a moment before the game . I beg your pardon: A Gerrard fan expresses her support for the Liverpool captain . In full voice: Liverpool fans sing that famous, spine-tingling anthem before kick-off . Even . though there were no further goals, a crowd of 36,170 saw Liverpool . take a definite step forward on their performance when they lost 1-0 to . Roma in Boston and Rodgers will be looking for more of the same again . when they return to New York for the first time in 10 years to play . Manchester City. City, . of course, are the standard-bearers back in the Premier League but the . game may yet be revealing to see where Liverpool now stand in relation . to the champions. Two points separated them last May – Rodgers will be . hoping the changes he has made will bridge that gap. After the game, Rodgers said: 'I'm evaluating the fitness of the players but I was delighted with the team. Pride and passion: Liverpool fans show their colours during the friendly at Soldier Field in Chicago . Red is the colour: The crowd in Illinois was a sea of red as American-based Liverpool fans had the chance to cheer on their team . You'll never walk alone: One Liverpool fan joins in with the singing . Stateside support: These fans had an excellent view of Liverpool's 1-0 win against the Greek champions . Hand on heart: Fans pledge their allegiance to Liverpool as the match gets underway . 'We will get sharper but at the minute we are building up the resistance. Our passing was crisp and precise and I was also pleased with how we defended. Overall I was delighted.' Rodgers also paid tribute to Sturridge and was excited by the impact Markovic made. 'I have seen a difference in Dan and I think he's ready to be the main man,' he added. 'He has come back from the World Cup looking really sharp. Markovic looked exciting and Sterling was a joy to watch.' Liverpool's move to sign striker Loic Remy broke down earlier in the day, and Rodgers added: 'We are disappointed for the player but we have to move on. We have made a decision.'","Sterling fired the Reds ahead after five minutes with a close-range effort .

"Adorable babies born at a Pittsburgh hospital are heading home with their parents in tiny stockings. The Magee-Women's Hospital at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center snapped photos of the tots lined up in the stockings, each with a green or red hat atop their head. Parents spending their first Christmas with their babies at the hospital get the stockings and hand-knitted hats as keepsakes, ABC reported. Nurses at the hospital have been organizing the event for several years, it added. Gifts: Newborn babies are seen bundled in tiny stockings at Magee-Women's Hospital at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania. Their parents can keep the stockings and hats as keepsakes . On Facebook, staff shared a photo of the pile of tiny hats that volunteers have kindly knitted for the new arrivals. 'If you've walked through the Magee lobby recently, you may have noticed a group of women surrounded by construction tape,' a message on the page read. 'Known as the ""Magee Knitters"", the group started in September 2014 with a mission to make caps for the newborn babies at the hospital.' By Tuesday, the Magee Knitters had whipped up a staggering 193 hats for the babies. 'Of course, they're always happy to welcome new members, so next time you're in the neighborhood, swing by the Magee Knitters station!' it added. Festive: The hospital has been carrying out the tradition with the help of volunteers for several years . Nearly 11,000 babies are born at Magee each year, which accounts for 45 per cent of all births in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, according to the hospital's website. The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is the largest in the state and one of the largest in the U.S. and treats more than 1,500 seriously or critically ill babies each year. Other hospitals around the country have also adopted the tradition, including Kettering Medical Center in Ohio, which has been popping tots in stockings for 20 years. In Albuqurque, New Mexico, the Presbyterian Hospital has been sending babies home in stockings for 36 years. This year, staff worked on 35 stockings for the babies. Good work: This year, volunteers knitted nearly 200 hats for newborns at the Pittsburgh hospital.

"A disabled puppy dubbed 'the mermaid dog' because her badly bent legs dragged behind her has been taken for a walk for the first time in her life after pioneering surgery. Daisy, a 14 week-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel cross Toy Poodle, was born with problems that affected her back legs, earning her the nickname 'the mermaid dog'. She either walked like a seal with her legs spread behind, or had her legs folded inwards under her body leaving her dragging her feet and shuffling her bum along the floor. Once nicknamed 'the mermaid dog', Daisy is now able to enjoy running and walking like any other dog. Here she is pictured going for a run after her surgery, for which the back half of her body was shaved . Daisy, who was originally called Tuffty, was taken to a vet to be put down by a dog breeder, but the vet passed her on to an animal shelter. Her new owners Paul Brothwell, 57, and wife Debbie, 54, fell in love with her after spotting her at Ravenswood Pet Rescue, Cambridgeshire. The couple spent £2,500 on pioneering surgery for Daisy at the Queen's Veterinary School Animal Hospital in Cambridge. Surgeons had to use tweezers and small eye surgery tools to delicately fix Daisy's knee joints as she is so small. She now has a new lease of life and is able to run around with the family's other dogs Harry, a two year-old chihuahua cross Yorkie, and Alfie, a nine year-old Yorkie cross Jack Russell. Mr Brothwell, who works for Anglian Water, said: 'When we saw her we just fell in love with her. 'She dragged along her legs a bit like a seal. Her knee caps weren't in the right place and her hips were funny and we just felt so bad for her. 'She wasn't in pain but she was very uncomfortable and she couldn't bear any weight on her right leg.' Daisy (pictured), a 14 week-old puppy, was born with problems that prevented her from using her back legs . But since her pioneering surgery - carried out with tweezers and eye surgery tools - she has been able to run and play like any other dog. Here she is pictured on the right in the arms of her owner Debbie Brothwell . Mr Brothwell added: 'She used to drag her bum across the floor and that would also be uncomfortable. 'We were absolutely thrilled to know she could be helped and though the surgery cost a lot it was worth it. 'We were told the day after the operation she just stood up, it was incredible. 'My wife Debbie used to take Daisy out in her coat while the other dogs were walked, but now she can join in. 'Now she charges around the house like a mad thing. She can play with Alfie and Harry and though her legs still go slightly to the left they are more or less straight.' Mrs Brothwell, a carer, said: 'Her legs were like jelly, she just dragged them round in the position she got up in. 'It's amazing to see her be able to walk. We were told by one vet to think about putting her to sleep but we just couldn't, and Daisy proved them wrong.' Daisy was already fixed at the rescue centre with splints which helped her build up the ability to walk. But the centre never thought a family would be kind enough to not only take on Daisy, but fork out the cost for surgery too. Her legs still veer slightly to the left (as pictured on the right), but her condition is now significantly improved from when they were 'like jelly', owner Paul Brothwell said . Daisy pictured having a nap after having gone for her first walk following surgery . The Brothwells were told the surgery - which carried a 50 per cent success rate - would cost a whopping £10,000, but orthopaedic surgeon Gareth Arthurs found a way of doing it for a quarter of the price. The delicate surgery, which involved filing a groove in her bones to help reset her legs and get her knee caps to sit properly, was the first time it had been carried out at the practice. Paul, who is dad to Sarah, 33, Sophie, 30, and Lucy, 23, said the pup was already walking on all fours when she was ready to return to their home in Orwell, Cambridgeshire. Sophie, a school teacher, said: 'A call to adopt her was put on Facebook and that's how we first found out about her. We called her the mermaid puppy. 'She still needs some physio. We're doing hydrotherapy with her, which makes her fur come out all fluffy - it's adorable. 'She may need hip surgery later, but for now she loves running about and we're so happy to have her this Christmas.' The family are planning to fundraise for Daisy's future hip surgery and are getting in touch with Paul O'Grady to see if he can help.

"A former leader in the Church of Scientology - who has since left the controversial church - claims that current leaders setup high-tech surveillance cameras to spy on him and his wife in their rural Texas home, according to a lawsuit the former leader's wife has filed in a Texas district court. Monique Rathbun, the wife of former Scientology leader Marty Rathbun, claims church members - at the apparent directive of church leader David Miscavige - rented property near a home where the couple lives in order to spy on them. According to the suit, filed in Comal County, Texas, church members 'harassed, insulted, surveilled, photographed, videotaped, defamed and humiliated' the couple. Scroll down for video . Former Scientology leader Marty Rathbun and his wife, Monique, claim the church has been spying on them . The Leader: The Rathbuns hope they will be able to depose Scientology leader David Miscavige in person . One group of scientologists, known as 'squirrel busters,' were seen wearing t-shirts with Rathbun's face on them as they filmed the couple near their Texas home. 'The intent was to make our life a living hell and drive us out of our . hometown, which succeeded. We moved to hill country, property surrounded . by woods. They tracked down the owner of a 5-acre undeveloped property . behind us and leased it and put what appeared to be camouflaged game . cameras,' Marty Rathbun told Page Six. 'But upon inspection they turned out to be high-tech human . surveillance cameras — the same cameras used by the DEA and patrol on . the Mexican border and now by drug dealers to counteract the DEA. They . were camouflaged in cameras that appeared to be to alert hunters to the . movement of deer.' Controversy: Scientology is one of the more controversial religions in the world today, with many describing it as a 'cult' Until 2004, Marty Rathbun was the 'inspector general' of Scientology's Religious Technology Center. But he and Miscavige had an apparent falling out, and he left the church. His wife was never a member. The couple now hopes to depose the church's leader, David Miscavige, which Scientology critic Tony Ortega says is likely going to happen. On his blog, Underground Bunker, Ortega writes that Texas Judge Dib Waldrip 'has ordered the deposition of Miscavige with no restrictions.' The church, Ortega writes, asked that Miscavige give his deposition in writing, a request Judge Waldrip evidently denied. Celebs: Scientology has dozens of famous members, including Tom Cruise and Jon Travolta . 'The main thing is we get the time to do discovery,' the Rathbun's attorney, Ray Jeffrey, told Ortega. 'David Miscvaige is still in this lawsuit, and has to give his deposition.' Ortega says that 'Miscavige . had argued that he had nothing to do with the harassment campaign that . Monique alleges made her life miserable over the past four years. And . although one church entity, the Church of Scientology International, has . admitted to running that campaign, Miscavige claims that he has nothing . to do with CSI and instead only runs a different church entity, the . Religious Technology Center (RTC), and should be let out of the lawsuit. Monique argues that he runs all aspects of Scientology, and she should . have the ability to depose Miscavige before Judge Waldrip can make a . decision about Miscavige’s request to be let out of the suit.' The Church of Scientology has long been suspected of harassing its critics and leading campaigns to silence those who they feel are a threat to the religion.","Marty Rathbun and his wife claim church members have rented property near their home in order to spy on them .

"Thousands of jobs are at risk over the festive period as one of the UK's biggest parcel delivery services collapsed in to administration on Christmas Eve. City Link, which has been loss-making for years, has called in the professional services firm Ernst and Young and stopped accepting parcels from customers. The news comes ahead of what is expected to be a busy time for retailers, with many chains starting their Boxing Day sales online 24 hours earlier. City Link, which has been loss-making for years, has called in the professional services firm EY and stopped accepting parcels from customers . EY said it expected 'substantial redundancies' over the coming days because no buyer had been found to save the troubled company. City Link, which is owned by investment firm Better Capital after it was purchased for £1 last year, is understood to count John Lewis among its largest clients. Today the retailer told MailOnline that none of its orders had been affected by Citylink's collapse. 'John Lewis has worked with City Link during this challenging period and provided significant support to enable them to trade. 'It is always a matter of deep regret when any of our suppliers are unable to continue with their business. 'John Lewis operates its deliveries and click and collect proposition through a number of external suppliers as well as its own in-house green van fleet.

The courier company has suffered from poor systems and an overcrowded market in recent years, due to the rise in online shopping. Hunter Kelly, joint administrator to City Link, said: 'City Link Limited has incurred substantial losses over several years. 'These losses reflect a combination of intense competition in the sector, changing customer and parcel recipient preferences, and difficulties for the company in reducing its cost base. 'The strain of these losses became too great and all but used up Better Capital's £40 million investment, which was made in 2013 and intended to help to turn around the company.

'Despite the best efforts to save City Link Limited, including marketing the company for sale, it could not continue to operate as a going concern and administrators were appointed. 'We have temporarily suspended operations at all transport hubs and depots until Monday, when we intend to reopen depots to the public to enable customers and intended recipients to collect their parcels. 'We will also provide support to employees relating to potential redundancies. We are now beginning the process of realising the company's assets.' Customers who had placed parcels with the company on Christmas Eve and intended recipients who have been notified of a failed or pending delivery are urged to retrieve their parcels as soon as possible on or after Monday. They can do so at the company's 53 depots throughout the UK, which will remain open for a short period of time to enable people to collect their parcels. The firm's online parcel tracking system remains live and a help phone will be open on Saturday  and from Monday. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said: 'This is the bitterest blow any group of workers could receive on Christmas Day and it is absolutely shocking that the company have sprung this announcement once all the Christmas deliveries have been completed. 'RMT will do everything within its power to mobilise a political and industrial fight to save the thousands of jobs that have been put at risk as a result of this shock announcement.'

"Forget the swans, this year babies are a-swimming. Infants just a few months old have been photographed diving underwater in their Christmas outfits. With no armbands in sight, they grin for the camera and swim unaided towards their festive toys. The adorable pictures have been produced for the holiday season by a swimming school for infants. Scroll down for video . Santa's missing reindeer: Wearing a glittery pair of antlers, Mya Spragg was one of a number of babies to be photographed for the swim school . Santa and his little helper: Jasper Cox and Felix Ross dressed up in their best Christmas costumes for the underwater photo shoot . Close to Christmas: Little Alice Knight appeared to need a bit more encouragement, and was snapped diving towards her snowman teddy . While some of the children seem far too young to be diving, their instructors say it is good for babies to swim from birth so they are not scared of the water. Among the gorgeous models is Olivia Parry, who is seen at just a few months old in her red and white outfit and Santa hat, which is touching the water’s surface. Her big beautiful eyes gazing at the camera, she is perfectly calm gliding under water. Osian Kerton, meanwhile, makes a plunge in his green elf costume, with a red and green ‘Santa’s little helper’ hat and Alex and William Steward and their friend Beau West beam as the three kings in their gold crowns. Siblings Erin and Oakley Nicholson also posed in their Christmas hats, with Erin sticking her tongue out for the camera, clearly delighted to be in the pool. Alisha and Sophia Sunthareswaran laughed as they posed with a doll as Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus. Camera ready: Ethan Whitehouse was determined to keep his eyes open for his close-up as he dived into the water to have his photo snapped . Santa's little helper: Olivia Parry is seen at just a few months old in her red and white outfit and hat, which is touching the water’s surface . Festive family: Siblings Erin and Oakley Nicholson also posed in their Christmas hats, with Erin sticking her tongue out for the camera . Barney Burns, however, looked slightly alarmed in his bright red reindeer antlers and Alice Knight appeared to need a bit more encouragement, diving towards her snowman teddy. The photographs were produced by Water Babies, a British baby and toddler swim school, which teaches more than 41,000 babies a week learn to swim at franchises across the UK and Ireland. The shoot was overseen by specially trained ‘dipographers’, who are experts in watching and interpreting babies’ body language and expressions to make sure they are completely happy in the water. Water Babies encourages parents to take their children swimming from birth – because, they say, it is good for bonding, teaches babies not to be frightened of water and is great exercise. Underwater nativity: Alisha and Sophia Sunthareswaran laughed as they posed as Mary, Joseph, with a doll standing in as baby Jesus . A royally good time! Alex and William Steward and their friend Beau West beam as they dress up as the three kings in their gold crowns . (Rein)deer in the headlights: Barney Burns looked slightly alarmed as he took the plunge in his massive bright red reindeer antlers . Babies instinctively hold their breath when submerged and can move freely in water supporting their weight. But they do not have the strength to swim to the surface. Since Water Babies started in 2002, its research has found that babies who participate show improved patterns of eating and sleeping. The instructors also claim swimming promotes bonding between babies and their parents. Co-founder Paul Thompson said: ‘Swimming with your baby is an unforgettable experience for both parent and child, allowing you some special one on one time to focus on each other. ‘Studies have shown that participating babies have improved sleeping and eating patterns, thanks to the hidden physical workout received during the gentle class.’ Perfect paddling: Infant Phoebe Day matched her red-and-white hat to a festive striped bib for her turn in front of the underwater camera . Water baby: Edith Potter looked relaxed in the water as she took a dip wearing her Santa hat. She is one of a number of babies learning to swim . It's in the name... Amalie Waterworth brought a pop of colour to the pool in her fuchsia and orange swimming bottoms and red Santa hat . The company, which has teamed up with Manchester University to examine the effects of baby swimming classes on children, parents and the family unit, said their students have saved their own lives because of their lessons. In the lessons, the infants learn how to kick to the surface, swim to and hold on to the nearest solid object and, where possible, how to climb out of water. At least ten of the children, they claim, have used their skills to get out of life-threatening difficulty. Five of them were just two at the time. Water Babies’s research also shows 75 per cent of parents do not know that drowning is the third highest cause of accidental death of children in the UK – and the average child at the moment only learns to swim when they are four years old. Reaching out: Hands stretched out in the water in front of him, Alfie Weston also chose a Santa hat for the swimming school's photos . Bobbing along: Toby Brooks' Santa hat floated to the surface as he floated underwater for his photograph . The instructors said most children panic when they find themselves suddenly in water, caused by the shock of not being familiar with swimming. ‘In most cases, it’s the shock of sudden submersion that causes children to panic. We passionately believe that by introducing babies to water as early as possible, they’ll be less likely to experience fear if they do fall in,’ Mr Thompson added. Water Babies’s youngest student to enrol is Phoenix Charles Elwell, who was just one day old when he was first taken swimming by his parents. The newborn was taken swimming by his father Simon, 30, in the hydrotherapy pool at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon. Mr Elwell, a Water Babies instructor who is married to Rebecca, 33, and also has a two year old daughter Alyana, said of his baby son: ‘He absolutely loved his time in the pool. I think he would quite happily have gone to sleep in the water when we finished. It was quite special for me too.’","Infants just a few months old have been photographed diving underwater in their tiny Christmas-themed outfits .

"Dressed in a Santa Claus outfit for a holiday party over the weekend, 24-year-old Eddie Fuentes was the designated driver who made sure everyone got home safely –- everyone except for himself. Last Saturday, Fuentes was standing next to his favorite hot dog joint, Original Maxwell Street in Chicago's Gage Park neighborhood, just after 3am when he was struck and killed by a suspected drunken driver. Jason Rayford, 30, has been charged with reckless homicide and domestic battery in connection to the deadly crash in the 5300 block of South Western Avenue. Scroll down for video . Tragic loss: Eddie Fuentes, 24 (left), was the designated driver at a holiday party last weekend when he was struck and killed by Jason Rayford, 30 (right) The crash happened outside Fuentes' favorite hot dog joint, Original Maxwell Street on South Western Avenue . Detectives say Rayford was punching his wife in the face during a dispute as she drove her 2006 Chevy Impala, reported NBC Chicago. At one point, police say the 30-year-old grabbed the steering wheel and that is when the car careened into Fuentes who was standing next to his car parked outside the hot dog stand at the time. The 24-year-old man was rushed to Advocate Christ Medical Center suffering from a severe brain injury. He passed away five hours later, still wearing his Santa suit. Jason Rayford attempted to flee on foot after the crash but was caught a short time later. Three witnesses identified Rayford from a police line-up. His 29-year-old wife has been charged with a DUI. According to his arrest report, Rayford, an employee at a chemical transportation company, is a suspected member of a Chicago street gang. On Tuesday, the 30-year-old appeared in court for his arraignment. A judge gave him the option of being released on electronic monitoring, if he qualifies for the program, or on $100,000 bail. Light of their lives: Fuentes (right), pictured here with his mother (center) and older brother Fernando (left), has been described as the glue that kept their family together . Premonition: Eddie, pictured here during his sister's wedding in September, was urged by his mother to 'be careful' on the day of the party Saturday. He replied, 'I will, I love you' Rayford also has been prohibited from getting behind the wheel, if he is released from jail. Eddie Fuentes' family were struggling this week to accept the loss of the bright, kind-hearted and gregarious graphic design student who was the glue that kept his family together. The youngest of four siblings, Eddie was described as a gifted guitar player who was a year away from graduation, according to his older brother Fernando. Mr Fuentes, 28, recalled how the last time he saw his beloved kid brother alive, which was a day before the crash, he had just returned home from his job in tech support for RedBox and hugged him from behind. ‘He was too young to go,’ Fernando said. ‘He always made sure his friends got home safe. It hurts that no one made sure that he got home safe.’ Eddie's mother, Laticia Monarrez, tearfully recalled to ABC 7 Chicago how on Saturday night before the fateful party she told him, 'Be careful, Eddie.' The 24-year-old kissed her and replied, 'I will, I love you.' Those were Eddie’s last words to his mother. Everyone in the Fuentes family have their favorite ‘Eddie’ memory: how he liked to joke around with his father about his height and made popcorn for him after work; how he spent hours watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta with his mother, and how on the day of his sister’s wedding in September Eddie helped the bride paint her nails. Above all, Eddie will be remembered for being caring and compassionate towards those he loved. ‘He always made sure his friends got home safe. It hurts that no one made sure that he got home safe,’ his brother Fernando lamented in an interview with Chicago Tribune. Eddie’s big sister Patty Landeros has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help the family bring justice for their beloved son and brother.","Eddie Fuentes, 24, died from brain injury last Sunday after being struck and killed outside a Chicago hot dog stand .

"A singer once praised as the 'reincarnation of Michael Jackson' has claimed he is the dead star's son. Brandon Howard, whose mother is pop singer Miki Howard, is said to have 'groundbreaking' DNA evidence proving he is the King of Pop's offspring, TMZ reported. Ms Howard is said to have met Jacko in 1982, shortly before Mr Howard was born in 1983. Scroll down for videos . Claims: Singer Brandon Howard (left) claims he has 'groundbreaking' DNA evidence which proves he is the son of King of Pop Michael Jackson (right) Testing: Mr Howard, 31, having his DNA taken, as he aims to prove he is the eldest child of Billie Jean star, Michael Jackson. His friend, actor Corey Feldman stands close by . Howard Weitzman, Jackson's estate lawyer, told TMZ: 'We've never even heard from him,"" when asked about Howard's claim.He added that 'any deadline for claiming to be Michael's child has long since passed'. The results of the DNA test are due to be revealed today live on FilmOn.com at 12pm Pacific time, 8pm (GMT). The artist known as B Howard released a statement today through his manager Scott Broomfield of Musical Star LLC. He said: 'To my fans, family, and friends, despite recent allegations, I did not authorize the testing of my DNA to be compared to that of the late Michael Jackson nor did I contact TMZ regarding the publication of the story. 'This spring, I agreed to be a part of a documentary with FilmOn.TV and was asked to give a sample of my DNA. 'Even though I agreed to this I never expected it to be used in this manner. Comparison: Brandon Howard, who is known as B Howard, has long been compared to the late superstar . Affair: Brandon Howard is said to be the product of an affair Michael Jackson had with the singer's mother Miki Howard. The pair are said to have met in 1982, shortly before he was born in 1983. But today, his father Augie Johnson dismissed the claims . Family: Brandon Howard (centre) is pictured with his mother, singer Miki Howard (right) and Chaka Khan (left) 'To this day, I have never claimed to be Michael Jackson's son nor do I have any intention of pursuing the family's estate.' The estate has been estimated as holding $17million in cash and earning $600million in revenue. Mr Howard has long been compared to the Billie Jean singer, but has said in the past the similarity is not intentional. 'I just do what’s naturally in my heart, and that’s what comes out,' he told EUR’s Lee Bailey exclusively. 'I’m doing me.' 'Who hasn’t been inspired by Michael and the Jackson brothers?' he added. 'Most of the people out now, even my good friend Ne-Yo, he’s come out with the sequined jacket and everything. For me, it’s more of I’m doing me. …I’m just me. I’m Brandon.' His musical legacy spans to his mother the pop star Miki Howard and his grandmother, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Josephine Howard. B Howard’s career has been gaining momentum, and he worked on songs with many multi-platinum selling artists including pop superstar Akon —an artist who was very close to Michael and released the star' last ever song, Hold My Hand. At the time of Michael’s death, he was named in more than six lawsuits, and 65 creditors’ claims were filed after he died. Eldest: If the results prove positive it would make Brandon Howard the eldest of Michael Jackson's children. However, singer Augie Johnson says he's his biological dad . Siblings: Jacko's children, Prince Michael Jackson II (left), Paris (centre) and Prince (right) Claims: Shortly after Michael Jackson's death in  June 2009, his father claimed Omer Bhatti, who sat with the family in the front row at Jacko's funeral, was his fourth child. But the Norwegian dancer, pictured (left) with MJ in Tunis when he was 12, denied the claims . Howard's CV reveals a long list of stars the singer, songwriter and producer has collaborated with. They include Ne-yo, Chris Brown, Missy Elliot, Lupe Fiasco and Vanessa Hudgens. Last year he teamed up with Wyclef Jean and Jazmine Sullivan for the World Cup son Ke Nako. Howard has three different record deals across the world, including a production pact with Universal Music, linked to his own company 6 Point Entertainment. The Jackson family have faced previous claims by people who believed they were the offspring of the star, who died in June 2009. In 2009, Joe Jackson, Michael's father, said he believed Norwegian dancer Omer Bhatti was Jacko's fourth child. Joe said at the time: 'I knew Michael had another son, yes I did. 'He looks like a Jackson, he acts like a Jackson and he can dance like a Jackson.' But the rapper, who claimed to be Michael Jackson's best friend, denied he was the King of Pop's love child, despite being given a front row seat at his funeral. Lawsuits: At the time of his death in 2009, Michael Jackson was named in more than six lawsuits . At the time of Michael Jackon’s death, the singer was named in more than six lawsuits, and 65 creditors’ claims were filed after he died. Since his passing in 2009, the superstar had a resurgence of popularity, causing the executors of his estate to try and find ways to re-release his works. It has propelled his wealth and he is still the highest earning dead celebrity in the world, raking in around $160million last year. However the amount he left in his estate is widely disputed. He was reportedly $500million debt, but last month, his executors were accused of cheating taxpayers out of millions of dollars by allegedly undervaluing his wealth. Legal documents filed with the U.S. Tax Court in Washington, which were obtained by the L.A. Times, said that after Jackson died in June 2009, the executors of his estate valued the singers net worth at around $7billion. However the IRS disputed the figure and claim MJ is actually worth a staggering $1.125 billion. A number of projects released after his death, however lucrative, have also caused legal issues. Last year his producer Quincy Jones, sought $10million after claiming a deal for his material was breach when the soundtrack for documentary ‘This Is It’ and the 25th anniversary edition of the Bad album were released. Last October, the family also lost a $13billion lawsuit against his concert promoters AEG, claiming failing to prove the company were negligent for hiring Conrad Murray, who was jailed for his involuntary manslaughter in 2011. In 2012, Michael Jackson's father dropped a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the former doctor who was convicted of causing the singer's death. Estate: The star's estate, which includes his Neverland ranch (pictured), was valued at $7billion . Court records show Joe Jackson's request for a dismissal. The filings did not elaborate on a reason for dropping pursuit of the case. In 2013, Debbie Rowe threatened to sue Michael Jackson's doctor over accusations she stole Demerol to supply to the late star. The 54-year-old nurse got involved in a bitter war of words with dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein - who introduced Debbie to Michael after being employed as a nurse by him in the 1980s - on Twitter, after he alleged she took the powerful painkillers from his practice to feed the singer's addiction.","Brandon Howard, 31, has long been compared to the King of Pop .

"A British walker was stunned after she came across this strange exotic fungus which appeared to have six red tentacles. Lucy Purdy was enjoying a stroll through the countryside of Dartmoor in Devon when she was hit by the smell of rotting flesh. Intrigued she found the creature which bears a close resemblance to an octopus, with red 'tentacles' emerging from a pod lying on the ground. Walker Lucy Purdy was stunned when she discovered the Clathus Archeri fungus (pictured) more commonly known as 'devils fingers' or 'octopus stinkhorn', growing in Dartmoor, Devon . She took a quick snap of the putrid pod and sent it into the workers at Devon Wildlife Trust, who identified it as Clathrus Archeri. Clathus Archeri, more commonly known as 'devils fingers' or 'octopus stinkhorn', is identifiable by its long red tentacles, and foul smell which it uses to attract flies. The exotic fungus is native to Australia and New Zealand was first discovered in the UK a century ago - and only occasionally found here. The fungus' long red tentacles means it bears a close resemblance to an octopus (pictured) although it is a couple of legs short . The exotic fungus is native to Australia and New Zealand was first discovered in the UK a century ago - and only occasionally found here . It is believed the species travelled to the UK inside crates of military weapons shipped to the South West from the Antipodes early in the First World War. The creepy-looking growth is formed when four to seven tentacles erupt from a suberumpent egg, and slowly grow as the fungus matures. Initially the tentacles are white, and the fungus strongly resembles a disembodied human hand. After a while the tentacles open up and develop their adult colour of pinkish-red. The devils fingers are not poisonous, and are technically edible, although due to their foul taste and smell it is recommended they are only eaten in wilderness survival circumstances.","Lucy Purdy was on a country walk when   the smell of rotting flesh hit her .

"It's the story that left the nation heartbroken and in tears. For Sydney teenagers - the Lawrence brothers - it's been the toughest of years.

But when their gut-wrenching story first when to air on Nine Network's A Current Affair earlier in the year, it changed their lives. With the help of more than $1.2 million donated by generous Aussies, the brothers say they're doing okay - despite what they've been through. The Lawrence brothers lost their father Christopher on February 2, 2008 'in unfortunate circumstances'. Mum Natalie died on March 17 this year after suffering two brain aneurisms. She was buried four days later, on Jarrod's birthday. Since then, Jarrod has vowed to look after his little brothers while also juggling his studies. In a follow up interview with A Current Affair on Thursday night, Jarrod recalled the moment he had to make the harrowing decision to turn off his mother's life support. 'It was four o'clock in the morning on Monday,' he said as he fought back tears. 'I woke them [the brothers] up and sat them on the lounge and said: ""Look mum's sick, the doctors don't think that she will get better"".' But in addition to losing both parents in the space of six years, youngest brother Dylan underwent brain surgery in 2012 to have tumours removed and is still on the mend. The boys are now in good spirits, trying to get through each day with the support of each other. 'We're alright I'll look after the boys and do the best I can,' Jarrod said. 'Obviously you can't become as happy as we were but we're getting through it. Yeah we're getting as happy as we can.'

The couple also have two grandchildren and will have 22 guests for lunch this year. Sadly Mrs Radford lost baby Alfie at 21 weeks in January but became pregnant again and her baby is due next year. Despite the incredible number of guests everyone will get a seat - as long as they help with the cleaning up afterwards, which involves huge amounts of washing up including five dishwasher cycles. Mrs Radford told Woman's Own: 'Christmas is exhausting, but I love it. 'It's such a magical time of year and it feels even more special with so many of us to celebrate.' Full family: Casper, two, Oscar, three, Tillie, four, Max, six, Josh, seven, Aimee, eight, Ellie, nine, James, 11, Katie, 12, Millie, 13, Luke, 14, Daniel, 15, Jack, 17, Chloe, 19, Sophie, 21, and Chris, 25, sandwiched by proud parents Sue and Noel . Mammoth effort: Each child will get four gifts each - but their parents use 80 metres of wrapping paper and spend two hours a night for a month getting them done . Siblings: Tillie and Josh spend some time on the internet by the tree and will probably do the same on Christmas Day . Excitement: Mr and Mrs Radford said that the children still believe in Father Christmas so Ellie, Aimee and Josh will be very excited today . The day starts with presents when the children get up at around 6.30am. Breakfast follows where they usually need three loaves of bread, 12 eggs, two boxes of cereal and 18 pints of milk. After their 1pm lunch members of the family play separate games of Monopoly, watch films and play with their presents. This evening there will more food, including six tins of Quality Street. Planning Christmas has become a military exercise. Mrs Radford said: 'With such a big family, I’ve become an expert at planning. It’s not like me to leave anything to the last minute, so Christmas preparation starts in September. Online shopping for presents is handy, but I’ll pick up things in town, too. 'For Christmas I have to keep a list – or I’d go mad! Each of the kids gets one main gift and three smaller ones – that’s 64 presents! This year, Chloe, 19, has asked for driving lessons and Max, six, wants a scooter. They all know there’s a budget so they’re not expecting a new Xbox. 'All the gifts need to be kept somewhere so Noel takes a few to work, while the rest are hidden in the basement. There are so many, I start wrapping when the kids are asleep, I spend about two hours each night. I get through at least 30 rolls of wrapping paper – it’s the job I hate the most. 'Of course, none of this is cheap. Our bakery business – which we bought before our fifth child Daniel was born – supports our family, but I set aside a few pounds each week for Christmas. And I make use of the offers in shops'. Mrs Radford says she won't be drinking because she is pregnant again - and admits she can barely remember a Christmas when she wasn't. And the couple - who feel 'incredibly lucky and blessed' admit they believe this child will be their last. Mrs Radford told The Sun: 'We weren't planning on getting pregnant so quickly. I wasn't sure it would happen, to be honest. 'This will be the last, 18 is enough. I've had bad morning sickness but it has stopped now so I am just waiting for the cravings'.

"A vandalised home covered with red spray paint and smashed windows sits vacant in an east side neighborhood of Detroit. The street used to be a busy hub of families, but its occupants have fled their homes leaving whole blocks empty and dark. The city's budget problems have . deepened to such an extent that it could run out of cash in a matter of . weeks or months and ultimately be forced into what would be the . largest-ever Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing in the United States. Ghost town: A vacant and blighted home, covered with red spray paint, sits alone in an east side neighborhood once full of homes in Detroit . The story of Detroit's decline is decades old - its tax revenue and population have shrunk and labor costs have remained out of unfeasible . Signs of decline are everywhere in . Detroit - crime is rising with the murder rate of one per 1,719 people . last year, more than 11 times the rate in New York City. The jobless rate is . above 18 percent, more than twice rate for the country as a whole. At the Detroit Auto Show earlier this . month, luxury was in the air. Pricey new Bentleys and Maseratis . glittered - including a Maserati 2014 Quattroporte with a $132,000 price . tag; U.S. Cabinet Secretaries and dignitaries rubbed shoulders; and . many of the well-heeled attendees ponied up for a $300-a-ticket . black-tie charity ball. Cuts: Spray paint on the front of a vacant and blighted home says the gas and water utilities have been turned off in the east side neighborhood . Running out: The city's budget problems have deepened to such an extent that it could run out of cash in a matter of weeks or months . But in a city that is slowly dying, the glitz didn't extend much beyond the Cobo Center exhibition hall. General . Motors Co (GM.N) and Chrysler (FIA.MI), which along with Ford Motor Co . (F.N) gave the Motor City its identity, survived near-death experiences . after filing for bankruptcy during the financial crisis. Now, Detroit itself is edging closer . to a similar precipice, only unlike the automakers, its chances of . getting a federal bailout are almost nonexistent. The . story of Detroit's decline is decades old: Its tax revenue and . population have shrunk and labor costs have remained out of sync. Bankrupt: Detroit could ultimately be forced into what would be the largest-ever Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing in the United States . Frustrated . by the lack of concrete progress, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a . Republican, last month appointed a team to scour the city's books. The audit could result in a state takeover of Detroit's finances through the appointment of an emergency financial manager. Such a manager, who would seize control of the city's checkbook, could . then propose federal bankruptcy court as the best option. Snyder, who has called the situation 'a crisis in terms of financial affairs,' said the team would deliver its report in February. Investigation: Frustrated by the lack of concrete progress, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, last month appointed a team to scour the city's books . 'Detroit is teetering on the verge of . bankruptcy after the City Council has failed to make the necessary cuts . to deal with having a smaller population,' said Rick Jones, chairman of . the Republican majority caucus in the state Senate. Jones, . who has indicated he does not favor a bankruptcy, said he would like to . see an emergency manager installed to fix the city's problems. If that . failed, there would be a case for finding a way to shrink the Detroit . municipal area, he argued. Detroit's . population is now just over 700,000 - down 30 percent since 1990 - but . the city still has to provide services to an area encompassing more land . than San Francisco, Boston and the borough of Manhattan. While Democratic Mayor Dave Bing and the Detroit City Council have moved to reduce spending and initiate some reforms to stave off a takeover, including layoffs and wage and benefit cuts, the progress may not be enough for Michigan officials and lawmakers. Spotlight: President Barack Obama speaks about the economy at the Daimler Detroit Diesel engine plant in December . In the booming post-Second World War era, Detroit was America's fifth-largest city. Today, . it ranks 18th. In addition to a sharp population decline, it suffers . from high unemployment related to a loss of businesses, a flood of home . foreclosures and a cut in state funding. That . has led to shriveling revenue, leaving the city unable to afford a . workforce of more than 10,000 and the surging health and pension costs . that go with them and with its retirees. Issues: Mayor Dave Bing talks about the city's crime problem during a press conference at the Coleman Young building in Detroit . As a result, credit ratings on Detroit's approximately $8.2 billion of outstanding debt have sunk deeper into junk territory. The . city's labor costs, including health care and pensions, are shrinking . in absolute terms but rising as a share of the budget. They . are slated to drop to $968 million, or nearly 49.5 percent of the . operating budget, in the fiscal year ending June 30 versus $1.14 . billion, or 45.5 percent, a year earlier. A bankruptcy would be messy. The interests of creditors would likely collide with those of labor unions wanting to protect workers' benefits, said Eric Scorsone, a Michigan State University economist who has written papers on municipal bankruptcy and on the state's emergency manager laws. 'It is going to require the players - the City Council, the mayor, the state - to be on the same page. If you go into bankruptcy with a lot of conflict and dissent, it's going to cost more,' said Scorsone. It could also be racially explosive. Detroit has the largest percentage of black people of any U.S. city, with 83 percent of the population identifying themselves as African American, black or Negro, according to the 2010 U.S. census. Most of Michigan's state government, including the governor's office, is run by white Republicans. Detroit Council Member JoAnn Watson, who along with two other members of the city's all-black City Council has been resisting reform measures, said she is still hopeful of a federal bailout or an injection of state money that she claims the city is owed. Changing times: In the booming post-Second World War era, Detroit was America's fifth-largest city . Heyday: Despite previous glory ears the city now suffers from high unemployment related to a loss of businesses, a flood of home foreclosures and a cut in state funding . Mayor Bing would not comment for this story. The . automakers have little to say publicly about the crisis. Most of their . operations in Michigan are now outside Detroit, and getting any top . executive to even discuss the possibility of a city bankruptcy was . almost impossible at the auto show. 'I don't want to get into the politics,' said GM CEO Dan Akerson, while . Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said: 'I don't see what the consequences . would be for us.' One . of the city's biggest challenges is its complex set of labor agreements . with a whopping 48 bargaining units that represent most of the city's . workforce. Trip through time: The Ford factory at Detroit Dearborn in Michigan . Thriving business: A gathering of workers in the yard of the Ford factories between the two wars . Control: Station of the electric commands regulating the temperature of ovens at the Ford car factory in Detroit . Max Newman, a . bankruptcy attorney at Michigan-based Butzel Long, said a Chapter 9 . bankruptcy could help the city throw out its collective bargaining . agreements with unions. Costs . would have to be tackled since Detroit cannot just jack up taxes to . reduce the cumulative budget deficit, which grew to $326.6 million in . fiscal 2012 from $196.6 million in fiscal 2011. The state would likely resist tax increases, and they might only make matters worse anyway. 'If taxes go up any further it would exacerbate the flight out of the city,' Newman said. But for some of those who have seen Detroit struggle for years, bankruptcy is starting to look like the least awful option - even though it will be painful. 'I think...off and on, that it wouldn't be a bad idea,' said former Ford chief financial officer Allan Gilmour, now the president of Detroit's Wayne State University. 'Let's clean this out once and for all.'","The city's budget problems have deepened to such an extent that it could run out of cash in a matter of weeks .

"Russia could use the crisis in Cyprus to secure a military foothold and energy rights in the Mediterranean, it was claimed last night. President Vladimir Putin called the decision to seize money from savers’ bank accounts as ‘unfair, unprofessional and dangerous’. But in a move that has raised eyebrows, the Russian energy giant Gazprom offered Cyprus a plan in which the company will undertake the restructuring of the country’s banks in exchange for exploration rights for natural gas on the island. Representatives of the Russian company submitted the proposal to the office of Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades on Sunday evening. President Vladimir Putin called the decision to seize money from savers' bank accounts as 'unfair, unprofessional and dangerous'. But a Russian energy giant has offered to restructure banks in exchange for gas exploration rights . It is also rumoured that the Kremlin is privately offering to help bail out Cyprus in exchange for the right to use a naval base in the Greek part of the island. Moscow has already handed over £2billion to prop up the economy of Cyprus and is now in talks to restructure the assistance programme. Russia currently has the use of only one foreign base at Tartus in Syria and docked warships in the Cypriot port of Limassol last year. Up to £30billion of Russian money is stashed on the island, in what financial services insiders claim is a massive money-laundering operation for oligarchs and plutocrats attracted by its low tax rates. Cyprus ranks as the largest source of foreign direct investment into Russia – money that is largely Russian in origin and passes through Cypriot banks before being sent back to Russia. US commentator David Frum said: ‘The island of Cyprus is home to about 1.1million people. ‘This smallish jurisdiction is home to one of the world’s largest banking industries, holding deposits equal to eight times Cyprus’s GDP. ‘Where’d that money come from? Cyprus has chosen to allows its banks to act as global money launderers.’ Russians have reacted with anger to the tax raid. ‘While assessing the proposed additional levy on bank accounts in Cyprus, Putin said that such a decision, should it be made, would be unfair, unprofessional and dangerous,’ said a Kremlin spokesman. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the eurozone decision seemed to be aimed at confiscating someone else’s property. ‘This practice, unfortunately, was well-known and familiar in the Soviet period,’ he said. Representatives of the Russian company submitted the proposal to the office of Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades on Sunday evening. Cyprus’s finance minister Michael Sarris will visit Moscow tomorrow for meetings to try to pin down new loan terms, a Russian government source said. Officials have also said Russian investors are interested in buying a majority stake in Cyprus Popular Bank and increasing their holdings in Bank of Cyprus – the two biggest banks on the Mediterranean island. British expats in Cyprus blamed the prevalence of dirty Russian money on the island for Germany’s decision to demand the tax raid in exchange for the bailout. Efy Charalambous, 53, from North London moved to Cyprus ten years ago and runs a fruit and vegetable business with her husband Chris. She said: ‘The only reason Germany is doing this is because they think rich Russians launder their money through the banks here in Cyprus. ‘But the Russians all carry cash, I know because they come here and buy fruit with 500 euro notes. The only people being hurt are expat Brits and ordinary Cypriot people.’ Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov also condemned the move and said the eurozone’s decision that Cyprus should introduce a levy on bank deposits was taken without consultations with Moscow. EU officials now expect Russia to extend its £2bn loan to Cyprus by five years until 2021 and possibly refinance its terms.","Gazprom submitted plan to Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades on Sunday .

"The demise of Wayne Rooney, it seems, has been greatly exaggerated once again. Not for the first time in his career, the Manchester United striker's longevity as a top level footballer had been questioned this summer in the wake of a difficult World Cup. This last week in North America, however, Rooney has shown his new manager Louis van Gaal that he remains hungry, motivated and, most importantly, eminently capable of lifting this United team when he feels the need. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Miralem Pjanic practice his 60-yard wonder strike . Opener: Rooney opened the scoring for United with a sublime strike from 25 yards in Denver . All smiles: Rooney celebrates with Antonio Valencia and Ander Herrera after the opener . On form: Juan Mata scored with a superb lob as the first-half came to a close .

Goals: Pjanic75, Totti (pen) 88 . Booked: Calabresi, Castan . Referee: Allen Chapman . Man of the Match: Wayne Rooney . Attendance: 54,117 . Poor for half an hour here at Sports . Authority Field on Saturday, Rooney hauled United to victory with two . stellar contributions towards the end of the first half. Not even a . second half goal from his own half by Roma substitute Miralem Pjanic . could upstage him. A . terrific Rooney goal – only made possible by perfect technique – from 25 . yards and then an even better pass to Juan Mata helped United in to a . 2-0 lead. Then, after a foul on Danny Welbeck, Rooney drilled the second . penalty of his tour past the Roma goalkeeper in the 44th minute. Given . the heat in Colorado on Saturday, Rooney was taken off at half-time as . part of an almost total United reshuffle. Roma would only have been glad . of that. Certainly it was rather peculiar to see United in front by three at half-time as for half an hour they had been pretty dreadful. With . Van Gaal once again using the 3-5-2 formation he has promised will be . the norm once the Barclays Premier League season starts, United’s . central defenders were not on the same page at all as Salih Ucan played . Seydou Keita in behind young Tyler Blackett for a clear run on goal. The . Roma midfielder looked as though he had scored as he lobbed the ball . over young goalkeeper Sam Johnstone but the ball took a huge bounce as . it landed five yards from the goal line and somehow ended up clearing . the crossbar. From range: Pjanic's strike from 60 yards stunned United goalkeeper Ben Amos and the Denver crowd . Spot: Rooney scored his second and United's third from the penalty spot as his side ran riot before the break . Sublime: Mata took the ball down from Rooney and lobbed over Roma goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski . Relieved not . to be behind so early, United tried to settle but their midfield kept . giving the ball away which served only to invite further pressure on . their uncertain defensive line. Ucan . may have done better than shoot at the goalkeeper after Tom Cleverley – . captain for the day – surrendered possession then Leandro Peredes and . Akessadro Florenzi came close. Rooney’s . first goal was lovely, though, and indicative of just what he can do . when the mood takes him. Receiving possession 25 yards from goal, the . 28-year-old shifted the ball to his right and whipped an unstoppable . shot across his own body and in to the goalkeeper’s right hand corner. Come together: United players show unity after celebrating Rooney's second goal . It takes two: Rooney is dispossesed by two Roma players in the first-half at Mile High . One . of the goals of Rooney’s United career, it seemed to inspire him for . just three minutes later he dropped in to his own half and, spotting . Mata’s run off a defender’s shoulder, dropped a pass perfectly in to his . path and watched as the Spaniard took possession and lifted the ball . over the goalkeeper and in to the goal off the near post. Roma could have been excused a little disbelief. They had dominated the game but suddenly found themselves two behind. It . soon got worse, too, as Danny Welbeck and Ander Herrera exchanged . passes only for Welbeck to be dragged down as he drove in to the penalty . area. The contact from Roma’s Mattia Destro may actually have been just . outside the box but Rooney didn’t care as he stepped up to drill the . fourth goal of his tour past Lukasz Skorupski from the penalty spot. Up and down: Van Gaal was pleased with the win but disappointed with the overall performance . Whipped: Nani, whose future is still unknown at United, attempts a cross-field ball in the second-half . Pressure: Mehdi Benatia closes down United and England striker Danny Welbeck . Mine: Rooney stretches in an attempt to get the ball from Mattia Destro . As . he had promised, Van Gaal made nine changes at half-time. Only . Cleverley and Blackett remained. Roma, meanwhile, introduced five new . players including former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole at left-back. It . was, however, a later substitute, the Bosnian midfielder Pjanic, who . lifted the crowd to their feet with 15 minutes left, beating Ben Amos . from ten yards inside his own half with a perfect lob that David Beckham . would have been proud of. Amos . was to redeem himself rather with a late save from a Leandor Castan . overhead kick but Francesco Totti reduced the deficit to one with a late . penalty after Michael Keane handled in the area.","Rooney grabs first-half double as United score three goals in nine minutes .

"The RSPCA has blasted the 'sickening' discovery of five dead ponies who were found piled up on top of each other in a village field. The grim discovery was found by a member of the public on Tuesday in a field on Rempstone Road in East Leake, Nottinghamshire. The passer-by then called the police and the RSPCA is now investigating after they removed the bodies of the animals and are searching for the owners. Scroll down for video . The five dead ponies who were discovered piled up on top of each other in a village field in East Leake, Nottinghamshire . It is believed the horses were badly neglected as they were found with large bruises and the charity added they were thankful no children had seen the bodies. Inspector Clint Davies from the charity said: 'This was a shocking discovery. Even in a nation of animal lovers, there are thousands of people out there who don't care about their animals at all. 'In fact, some literally treat them like rubbish. It's a bit like fly-tipping. ‘We can only speculate how they've died but they weren’t in particularly good condition from what we could see from the bodies.’ Residents in the village also told of their shock at the discovery. The RSPCA are now searching for the horses owners saying they believe they had been badly neglected before they died . Geoff Adams, 59, told the Nottingham Post: 'The village is usually quiet so it's come as a huge shock, especially because it's so close to Christmas. While Jennifer Marshall, 36, added: 'I hope people change their attitude towards animals. 'My 11-year-old daughter rides horses and she's devastated by the news.' RSPCA chief inspector Cathy Hyde, who heads a specialist team of equine officers, said the dumping of horses has become a growing problem across the UK. The ponies were found dead in a field on this road in East Leake, Nottinghamshire by a passer-by . She added: 'Over the past five years there has been a marked and very worrying increase in equine neglect and abuse. 'This is witnessed on a daily basis by front line staff. 'This disturbing trend in neglect seems to be affecting equines more than any other animals that we deal with.' Police say it is up to the RSPCA if they want to pursue a prosecution against the owners.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Owners reported the remote-controlled devices, or unmanned aerial vehicles to give them their proper name, flying out of control and vanishing on their maiden flights. Others crashed into neighbours’ gardens and roofs – while one even hit a dog. Scroll down for video . Remote control drones have been an incredibly popular Christmas present this year, however the Civil Aviation Authority warned that many new users do not realise they are subject to stringent restrictions . One drone flew within 20 feet of an aircraft on approach to Heathrow Airport in London (file picture) The Civil Aviation Authority says users could be fined up to £5,000 if they do not follow rules when flying drones. It followed several incidents involving the devices, including one with a passenger jet at Heathrow, raising fears that they could cause a disaster in the skies. The devices usually have cameras attached to allow users to take spectacular aerial images and have become increasingly popular among those wanting to take selfie-style photos, or ‘dronies’. Some models cost as little as £30, with the most sophisticated designs going for £3,000, and it is estimated that more than 30,000 will have been bought in Britain by the end of the year. Dozens of people took to Twitter yesterday to reveal their delight at receiving a drone as a gift. But some failed to get off to a flying start when they took theirs out for a spin. Among those was Nick Hardy, a sports equipment salesman, who wrote on Twitter: ‘I got a mini drone for Christmas and it’s in next door’s garden already. Typical.’ Angela Ryan wrote on the site: ‘Christmas at the Ryans’: Drone stuck on the neighbours’ roof...’ A remote control drone caused major controversy during a Euro 2016 qualifier match between Albania and Serbia when one fan flew an Albanian nationalist flag over the Partizan stadium in Belgrade, pictured . And Twitter user @katystddybr had an unfortunate incident with her dog. ‘I got this little remote control drone thingy for Christmas and I accidentally hit my dog with it omg he hates me,’ she wrote. ‘It’s so bad he won’t come near me, I almost had to cut his fur to get it out.’ The incident at Heathrow involved an Airbus A320 passenger jet. A remote-controlled device flown by an unidentified amateur was spotted by the airliner’s pilot but, alarmingly, was not detected by air traffic control radars. The UK Airprox Board, the air safety panel that investigates near misses, gave the incident the highest risk rating of A, meaning there was a ‘serious risk of collision’. A CAA spokesman said: ‘We know that unmanned aircraft of various shapes and sizes have been popular Christmas presents this year. However, people have to understand that they are subject to rules and cannot be used indiscriminately.’ The Civil Aviation Authority says: . - Drone pilots should not ‘recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property’. - They should not be flown out of sight of the pilot, generally 1,640ft horizontally or 400ft vertically. - If fitted with a camera, a drone should be flown at least 164ft away from a person, vehicle or building apart from on take-off and landing. - They should not be flown within 492ft of a congested area or large group of people, such as a sporting event or concert.","The Civil Aviation Authority warned new drone owners over safety rules .

"Cleared: Border officials interrupted the wedding of Muhammad Hassan Nazir, a Pakistan national, and Bulgarian Tanya Dimitrova Draginova. Above, the couple leave court arm-in-arm this week . A bride and groom who had their wedding interrupted by immigration officers who feared it was a sham marriage have been cleared. Muhammad Hassan Nazir, a Pakistan national, proposed to Bulgarian Tanya Dimitrova Draginova after he was arrested on charges relating to immigration fraud. After being alerted by claims made on Nazir's visa application, border officers raided their ceremony at Lancaster Register Office in a scene that was likened to one from iconic 1960s film The Graduate, the court heard. Miss Draginova later admitted to agreeing to marry Nazir because he had 'a problem', adding that he was a friend and she had only kissed him once. But the pair were cleared of arranging an unlawful marriage at Carlisle Crown Court on Tuesday. Nazir, 34, was sentenced to 10 months in jail after admitting to fraudulently staying in the UK. The wedding was described by Judge Peter Hughes QC as one of the 'desperate measures' taken by the defendant to remain in the UK. Tim Evans, prosecuting, compared the 'dramatic' ceremony on October 1 to the closing scene of The Graduate. He said: 'At the end of the film Ben Braddock - the Dustin Hoffman character - storms into a church where a wedding is taking place and stops it happening before running off with the bride. Well, no film set here.' After likening character Ben Braddock to Immigration Officer Steve Halfpenny - who 'too took the bride-to-be-away' - Mr Evans told the court in an interview that Miss Draginova admitted agreeing to marriage because he had a 'problem'. 'He was a friend of a friend and not a boyfriend and she was going to marry him so he didn't have to leave the UK,' said Mr Evans. The court heard she did not know where they would be living after the ceremony and she had only kissed him once. She also said that she did not intend to share a bed with him and the wedding rings had been bought a week or two earlier from Argos. But a jury was directed to a not guilty verdict for one charge of attempting to obtain leave to remain in the UK by deception against Nazir, . Miss Draginova was found not guilty of attempting to assist unlawful immigration to a member state. Admission: Miss Draginova (right) later admitted to agreeing to marry Nazir (left) because he had 'a problem', adding that he was a friend and she had only kissed him once. Above, the pair outside Carlisle Crown Court . The court was told how Nazir first came to the UK in 2005 and studied for a degree before securing a post-study work visa which ran out in 2010. Between 2010 and 2013 he had told the immigration authority he was living and working at a restaurant called Bombay Brasserie in Nottingham. But in fact he was working for K Cars in Kendal, Cumbria, and went on to 'run' the company for his Pakistan-based father. When he filled out another application to remain in the UK in July 2012, authorities were alerted by his claim to be working in an eatery in Birmingham while living in Kendal, Cumbria. Mr Evans told the court Nazir proposed to Miss Draginova just after being arrested on August 1 2013, and made arrangements with the registry office in September for their autumn wedding. In mitigation Gulam Ahmed said K Cars had since been sold for £5,000 and Nazir, who was now living in Manchester 'hangs his head in shame'. Mr Hughes said: 'The basis of your application was that you were to work as a full time assistant manager in Nottingham, on 40 hours a week with a salary of £28,000. 'That was the means by which you obtained leave to remain. 'I'm quite satisfied the information you gave about your employment was bogus from the outset.' He added: 'In 2013 you took a number of desperate measures in an attempt to stay in the country. Hollywood moment: Tim Evans, prosecuting, compared the 'dramatic' ceremony on October 1 to the closing scene of The Graduate, pictured above, in which Dustin Hoffman's character fled with the bride-to-be . 'Whether you would have lived together and made a relationship after the ceremony we will never know. At least you've not gone into the witness box and repeated your lies.' Nazir was sentenced to 10 months in prison for obtaining leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception. 'It will be up to the Immigration Authority what happens after that sentence,' added Mr Hughes.","Pakistani Muhammad Nazir was to marry Bulgarian Tanya Draginova .

"While most New Yorkers do all they can to avoid rats lurking in subway stops and city alleyways, a group of students is actively searching them out. Two teams from Fordham University have been traipsing across New York City to catch rats for research - in the hopes of finding out how the species has evolved differently across the island of Manhattan. Photojournalist Johnny Milano, who is based on Long Island, snapped a series of intriguing images showing the students hard at work as they sniffed out the fearsome rodents - before snipping off parts of their tails or feet for tests. The black-and-white photo series shows the students heading to far corners of the city or climbing through shrubbery as they put down traps filled with peanut butter, bacon bits and other greasy foods. A few days later, they return to collect them and carry out their tests. Hunt: Fordham University student Matt Combs measures a rat as part of a project to determine if rats in different parts of New York City display different genetic traits. The project began in 2013 and the small team has been collecting samples across the city ever since . Search: Another student, Otis Wood, searches for traps, which the team has so far laid across Central Park and Inwood . Study: Sample can be any part that contains DNA, but is most often taken from the tail or the foot, photographer Johnny Milano explained . The students believe that there are genetic differences in rats that are specific to their area in the city, that is, rats in downtown Manhattan could be genetically different from those in the Upper West Side. They have noticed, perhaps unsurprisingly, that well-kept areas of the city do not have many rats - such as Central Park - whereas well-populated areas, including playgrounds, are overrun with the rodents. 'I thought it was ironic, how rat populations relate to socioeconomics,' Milano told CNN in an earlier interview. The duo's project started in 2013 and will continue for at least two years. So far, they have set traps and collected samples in Central Park and Inwood, which is the northern-most part of Manhattan, and next year they will be searching other parts of the city, including Times Square. 'Our research seeks to understand how rats inhabit this environment,' student Matt Combs explained to Vice. 'What makes them more or less successful, and how they travel through a dense urban matrix like Manhattan.' Their tests have so far found 'there's a pattern of evolution', CNN reported. Ongoing search: The team plans to set more traps next year in parts of the city, including Times Square . Strange sight: Milano said he was inspired to capture the project because he wanted to look at a part of the city he had not seen before . Findings: The team believes the rats could have different genetics depending on where they are found in the city . For Milano, the strange subject choice was appealing. 'I wanted to focus on a project in the city that I hadn't seen before,' he said. In other photographs, shared on his website, Milano snapped another rat catcher team appropriately named 'R.A.T.S.', which stands for Ryder's Alley Trencherfed Society. The team, led by Richard Ryder, goes out at night with between four and ten dogs to catch as many as 20 rats in areas of the city. They train the dogs, mostly terriers, by allowing them to chew on rats as pups, or by simply taking them on searches until they show their genetic leaning towards hunting. The Fordham students are now working with R.A.T.S to collect samples for their study. The students found that the rat hunters were a far more efficient way of helping them find the rodents, Vice reported. The team says they have the support of nearby residents - and police even point them in the right direction for their next hunt. Killed: A dead rat can be seen inside a trap after being poisoned with Isothesia, a chloroform-like substance that the scientists use to kill rats that are still alive in the traps. They capture the rats by putting peanut butter or bacon bits inside the traps . Log: A book shows the researchers' log of rat numbers; they also get rats with the help of a city rat hunting society . Hopeful: The project, which will continue throughout next year, could show how rats have evolved within the island of Manhattan .","Fordham University students are capturing rats across the city in the hopes of finding out how the species has evolved differently across the island of Manhattan .

"A man who died after being Tasered by police by a 50,000-volt stun gun was not breaking into the property as thought but visiting friends for a quiet birthday drink, a friend has claimed. Adrian Thompson became unresponsive after being bundled into a police car and taken into custody in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, having been stunned. A call to the police suggested he was breaking into the property, but a friend has now insisted the 34-year-old had been invited to the scene in the early hours of Monday morning. His death is now being investigated by the Independent Press Complaints Commission. Scroll down for video . Adrian Thompson, 34, died after being Tasered by police at a property in Staffordshire . 'There was no burglary at the property. Adrian had come round for a few quiet drinks for my birthday,' said Paul Carter, who lives in the flat. 'Police were called when he became distressed as we wanted help for him. Adrian was a brilliant character.' Staffordshire Police however said it was called to the scene following reports of a burglary. 'The occupants of the house had left before officers arrived – leaving the man inside. 'During the incident, a taser was discharged by officers and the man was then taken to a police vehicle. 'While in the vehicle, the man became unresponsive and despite the efforts of paramedics from West Midlands Ambulance Service, he unfortunately died a short time later,' a statement read. The incident is now being investigated by the Independent Police Complains Commission. When contacted by MailOnline, the Commission said it could not comment on Mr Carter's claims. Commissioner Kathryn Stone OBE added: 'I would like to express my sincere condolences to the man’s family at this difficult time. Death: A man has died after being shot with a Taser stun gun by police at a home in Newcastle-under-Lyme . Investigation: The incident came after police allegedly received reports of burglary . 'We are at a very early stage of our independent investigation into the actions police took at the scene. 'We will be examining closely police involvement in this incident and the circumstances surrounding the man’s death.' Mr Thompson's death comes after Matthew Williams died after being shot with a stun gun. The 34-year-old had launched a horrific attack on Cerys Yem at a hostel where he was staying after being released from prison. Miss Yemm was allegedly murdered by Williams who ‘ate her face while high on cocaine’ in Caerphilly, South Wales. Police discharged the Taser after finding the 22-year-old unconscious with severe facial injuries. Solicitor Sophie Khan, from the Police Action Centre, has now called on Theresa May to consider a temporary ban on Tasers. She said stun guns are a ‘real threat to life and their use must now be curbed’. Neighbour Mark Finney, 50, said: ‘I was asleep and at around 1.30am, I woke up and heard shouting and tremendous banging. It sounded like someone was in distress.’ A 22-year-old local resident, who did not want to be named, said he heard the Taser victim shout ‘help me’ after the stun gun was fired at around 1.45am. He added: ‘There were seven or eight police and I saw them dragging this bloke out. ‘He was still alive then but he looked like he was drunk or something. They were carrying him with their arms under his shoulders. They bunged him in the back of the van.’ Police: Officers at the scene in the aftermath of the fatal Taser shooting in the early hours . Block: The incident and subsequent death happened at these flats in Newcastle-under-Lyme . On guard: A police officer at the scene with a Taser holstered on his jacket . Probe: The Independent Police Complaints Commission will be investigating the man's death . Quiet: The incident took place in the suburb of Chesterton just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme . An IPCC report revealed in July that Staffordshire officers had used Tasers as ‘a deterrent’ 619 times in the past nine years. Between 2012 and 2013, the force fired stun guns a total of 71 times – more than three times more than similar-sized forces such as Leicestershire and West Mercia Police. The weapons have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade. Staffordshire’s police and crime commissioner Matthew Ellis said it was ‘immensely sad’ that a man had lost his life, but added that it would be inappropriate to comment further during an ongoing IPCC investigation. Witness: Mark Finney said he heard screams but could not tell what was going on in the flat .

"Two teenagers were arrested on Christmas Eve for stabbing a nativity donkey 12 times and forcing it to miss its annual show. Cheeky the donkey, who is 22 years old, was due to star in the Christmas show at Greenmeadow Farm in Cwmbran, South Wales, until she was knifed in the night. Police have been hunting the cruel attackers since the knife assault in November and  two 17-year-old boys were arrested last night.

"Hunt supporters are plotting to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election. A Conservative pledge to hold a free vote in the Commons on scrapping the decade-old ban was quietly shelved after ministers realised it would be lost. But campaigners claim the result will be very different if Scottish MPs, dominated by Labour, are barred from voting on the issue after next year's election. Hunt supporters are plotting to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election . A well-placed source in the pro-hunting campaign said: 'Hunting is a classic example of the anomaly which allows Scottish MPs to dictate the law in England and Wales on an issue over which they themselves have no say in Scotland because it is a matter that has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament. 'Any move to stop MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from voting on devolved issues in the next parliament would, therefore, make repeal or amendment of the Hunting Act in England and Wales much more likely.' A strong showing by the SNP – whose MPs do not vote on English-only matters on principle – could have a similar effect. The move comes as more than 300 hunts and thousands of supporters prepare to ride out today in defiance of the ban, which was pushed through reluctantly by Tony Blair as a piece of 'red meat' to keep his backbenchers on side. The figures suggest that if Scottish MPs were allowed to vote then a bid to repeal the ban would fail by a majority of 16 . Research by the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance suggests that English and Welsh MPs would vote by a majority of 22 to scrap the ban if a vote were held now. The research, based on MPs' public and private indications, suggests that 292 MPs in England and Wales are in favour of repealing the law, with only 270 against. But the slim majority south of the border is heavily outweighed by overwhelming support for the ban among MPs in Scotland, where hunting was banned separately by the Scottish Parliament. The Countryside Alliance believes that Scottish MPs would vote to keep the ban by 47 votes to six. Northern Ireland's MPs are said to support repeal of the ban by eight votes to five.

The move comes as more than 300 hunts and thousands of supporters prepare to ride out today in defiance of the ban, which was pushed through reluctantly by Tony Blair to keep his backbenchers on side . But, following cross-party agreement that Scotland should be handed sweeping new powers, party leaders are now under intense pressure to bar Scottish MPs from voting on purely English matters at Westminster. Labour's 2004 Hunting Act does not apply in Scotland, where hunting was banned two years earlier. A Countryside Alliance spokesman said: 'The promised vote on repeal has not materialised in this Parliament, largely because of uncertainty about the outcome, with 41 Scottish Labour MPs effectively vetoing any change in the law in England and Wales. 'Scotland has its own hunting legislation and there can be no justification for continuing to allow Scottish Labour MPs to perpetuate the prejudice of the Hunting Act.' The Tories are expected to repeat their pledge to hold a free vote on hunting if they win the election. But anti-hunting groups are stepping up pressure on Labour to tighten the law, amid concern at the low level of prosecutions.","Hunt supporters want to use 'English votes for English laws' to repeal ban .

Shortly after the White Christmas Dip took place members of the Bournemouth Spartans, the town's long-running winter swimming club, took to the water. Peter Jenkins, 47, from Bournemouth, said: 'The water was freezing at first but after the initial shock it wasn't so bad. It certainly woke everyone up after their Christmas Eve indulgences.' A group of brave swimmers also continued a 150-year tradition as they jumped into the sea at Brighton on a crisp Christmas morning. A group dressed as Christmas puddings were among some of the more outrageous outfits seen at today's annual Exmouth swim . The revellers met next to the city's iconic pier at sunrise, defying council orders to stay away from the potentially dangerous waters today. Brighton and Hove City Council had decided it would close the beach today over 'safety fears' after a man got into difficulty in the waters earlier this year and another swimmer had to be rescued while taking part in the event three years ago. Brighton Swimming Club agreed to follow the council's lead and cancel its annual festive swim after its dedicated group of 30 experienced swimmers taking part has swelled to 4,000 revellers turning up at the beach in fancy dress and after heavy drinking in recent years.

"A family escaped disaster late on Christmas Eve after an overheated light bulb set fire to their roof. East Sussex Fire and Rescue were called to the scene just 40 minutes before Christmas Day to discover flames reaching more than 20 feet into the sky. The family, who have not yet been named, escaped unharmed from the blaze in Uckfield, East Sussex. The house on Oak Tree Court, Uckfield in East Sussex, pictured, caught fire late on Christmas Eve . More than three-quarters of the family home was destroyed by the blaze which took hold at 11.20pm . Luckily the family escaped with out injury as the blaze took hold late on Christmas Eve . It is believed that the blaze started accidentally in the loft of the semi-detached house. Firefighters managed to battle inferno and stop it from spreading to the house next door. Local Conservative Party councillor Michael Lunn said the timing of the incident, just minutes before Christmas Day was particularly unfortunate. He said: 'It is a very sad incident, but I know the Uckfield  community will rally behind the family. 'We will have an an appeal with the town and district council. 'The key thing is that everyone is completely safe and we are grateful to the emergency services for their actions.' Cllr Lunn said the family returned to the house briefly this morning to salvage personal effects and whatever Christmas gifts that had not been destroyed by either smoke or water. He added: 'The Uckfield community will always be there to support a family in crisis.' A spokeswoman for East Sussex Fire and Rescue said: 'Fortunately all persons had managed to get out and were all accounted for. 'Firefighters used breathing apparatus, firefighting foam and main jets to tackle the fire and they gained access to a neighbouring property to stop the fire spreading. 'They also spent time cutting away and salvaging items for the occupants.' The spokesman added that crews used an aerial ladder platform to remove tiles and make the roof safe. The family were forced to move out of the property as a result of the extensive fire and water damage. Firefighters with breathing apparatus searched the house and managed to rescue some of the presents .","The house in Uckfield, East Sussex caught fire at 11.20pm Christmas Eve .

"A new study says that global industrial civilization may collapse in mere decades due to unequal wealth distribution and increased strain on the planet's resources. The report, funded by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, investigates factors which may be most closely linked to civilizations' downfalls, including Population, Climate, Water, Agriculture, and Energy, The Guardian reports. Together, these factors can create resource strain and a wide gap between rich and poor. Increased strain on resources and widening gap between rich and poor may lead to industrial civilization's collapse, the study warns . In one scenario, a famine among 'Commoners' eventually causes the collapse of society, due to a loss of workers . The study, led by mathematician Safa Motesharrei, goes on to say the the rich, or 'Elites,' may be responsible for both problems, the Guardian notes. '...accumulated surplus is not evenly distributed throughout society, but rather has been controlled by an elite,' it says.  'The mass of the population, while producing the wealth, is only allocated a small portion of it by elites, usually at or just above subsistence levels.' Furthermore, technology also 'tends to raise both per capita resource consumption and the scale of resource extraction.' It also cites the downfall of other major, highly advanced civilizations, including the Roman, Han, Gupta and various Mesopotamian empires as evidence that they can be 'fragile and impermanent.' In both scenarios the study says that Commoners would collapse first, later followed by the wealthy Elites . Would societal collapse mean a doomsday scenarios like the one portrayed in 'The Day After Tomorrow?' (pictured) The study then lists a series of doomsday scenarios. In the first, the Elites 'grow and consume too much, resulting in a famine among Commoners that eventually causes the collapse of society. [This] is due to a loss of workers, rather than a collapse of Nature.' In the second, 'the decline of the Commoners occurs faster, while the Elites are still thriving. [Eventually] the Commoners collapse completely, followed by the Elites.' Because of a buffer zone due to their wealth, Elites may continue '""business as usual"" despite the impending catastrophe.' The study then goes on to say that in order to avoid societal collapse, the wealth gap must be greatly reduced and population must be controlled.","Collapse of civilization may be linked to increased strain on planet's resources and wide gap between the rich and the poor .

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is embroiled in a fierce row with ‘macho’ colleagues who accuse her of giving too much ground to teachers . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is embroiled in a fierce row with ‘macho’ colleagues who accuse her of giving too much ground to teachers. Close allies of David Cameron say Mrs Morgan, the surprise choice to replace Michael Gove, should take a more aggressive stance and trumpet her predecessor’s radical school reforms more clearly. One Government source said: ‘I don’t think there’s any question that she’s stumbling. She will have to be told.’ Mrs Morgan’s department has been nicknamed ‘the Department of Nice’ in Whitehall, because of what is perceived as the non-combative nature of the Education Secretary and her junior ministers, the source revealed. By contrast, Whitehall has a reputation of being male-dominated and some ministries in particular – such as the Department for Education under Mr Gove – were seen as having an aggressive ‘macho’ culture. Mrs Morgan has also been dubbed ‘Ms U-turn’ after reversing her opposition to gay marriage, watering down a list of approved punishments teachers can use against errant pupils and launching a consultation on whether teachers are overworked. Last night Mrs Morgan, 42, hit back at the criticism, saying sniping colleagues had little or no understanding of how toxic their attitude was to Conservative chances in marginal seats such as her own. A source close to the Education Secretary said she made no apology for ending Mr Gove’s ‘war against all’. Mrs Morgan, who is also minister for women and equalities, believes a more consensual approach stands a better chance of ensuring that Mr Gove’s reforms endure. ‘This would have more force if critics could point to one substantive area where we have retreated,’ the source said of the sniping. ‘She’s the only Conservative Cabinet minister with a marginal seat and that makes her more attuned than some to what voters do and don’t want to hear. Those urging total ideological purity or aggressive attacks on public sector workers tend to be those with the safest seats.’ Close allies of David Cameron say Mrs Morgan, the surprise choice to replace Michael Gove (right), should take a more aggressive stance and trumpet her predecessor’s radical school reforms more clearly . The source insisted Mrs Morgan had outclassed ‘vacuous’ Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt since taking on the brief in the summer. Other ministers claim Mr Gove’s new role as Chief Whip allows him to interfere in Mrs Morgan’s work, hampering her ability to carve out her own identity. ‘I think it’s fair to say that Michael retains a very strong interest in what is going on in his former department. I’m sure that doesn’t help matters,’ said one. A Downing Street spokesman strongly denied that Mr Cameron had been disappointed in her performance. ‘That’s not his view at all, and anyone criticising Nicky does not speak for him,’ he said. Mrs Morgan won her Loughborough seat with a majority of 3,744 over Labour, and has been identified as one of five members of the Cabinet facing a battle to hold their seats in May’s election. Pupils are spending more time on core subjects such as science and languages – while so-called ‘Mickey Mouse’ subjects such as media studies are on the decline. Since 2010, the number of hours teachers are spending on science and history has risen by a quarter, figures show. And the number of children taking GCSE exams in tougher subjects has soared since the election. The percentage of pupils taking exams at 16 in maths, English, science, a language and either history or geography has gone up by 60 per cent. Ministers said the figures were a vindication of Tory policies – in particular the introduction of the English Baccalaureate, a performance measure which promotes the subjects employers place most value on. The figures, contained in a parliamentary answer, show that between 2010 and 2013, the average number of hours spent teaching physics, chemistry, biology and history all rose by about 25 per cent. Languages also benefited, with the number of hours teaching Spanish up by 38 per cent. But the number of hours spent teaching media studies has fallen by 15 per cent. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘Our plan for education is working. Under Labour both academic and vocational subjects had been dumbed down and Britain was stagnating in international league tables. Now, academic standards are back.’","Education Secretary Nicky Morgan in fierce row with 'macho' colleagues .

"An English backpacker has had a Christmas to forget in Australia after falling nearly 30 metres from his apartment's balcony. Matthew Lehan, 22, spent Christmas day in hospital after surviving the six-storey fall with broken arms and cuts to his face and head. It is believed he was trying to climb from a seventh-floor balcony in a central Sydney apartment block to his own unit's balcony when he fell at 1am on Thursday, police said. Scroll down for video . Matthew Lehan, 22, spent Christmas day in hospital after surviving the almost 30 metre plunge . The view from Matthew Lehans balcony, where it's believed the 22-year-old was trying to climb from a balcony to his own unit's balcony when he fell . 'This man made a dangerous decision which resulted in serious injuries. It could have resulted in his death, but thankfully it didn’t’, a police spokesperson told Nine News. When he slipped off the window seal, he fell onto a first floor structure, an almost 30 metre plunge. It is believed he was trying to window hop into his room, which he was locked out of after losing his keys. The tin sheeting cushioned his fall from the concrete beneath, in turn saving his life. The man, reported to be an English backpacker, broke both his arms and cut his head and face. Mr Lehan, who was born in South Africa, is believed to have a permanent home in the UK. Just a month ago, Mr Lehan posted the following message on his Facebook account . According to previous posts on his Facebook account it would seem it is not the first time Mr Lehan has lost the keys to his apartment. In November he wrote that he had lost his key to his room, adding that that was ‘$20 down the toilet’ and he needed a job ‘pronto’. Mr Lehan, reported to be an English backpacker, broke both his arms and suffered lacerations to his head and face .

"He has a long white beard and a sack, but that's where the similarities end. In Siberia, he might be wearing a belt made from woolly mammoth bones and - shock, horror - not even arrive on Christmas Eve. So spare a thought for the Russian region, where no fewer than seven different Santa figures will bring joy to children in the coming weeks. All of them look old, with flowing white beards, and most have long histories, possibly reaching back to pagan times, but each is distinct and covers their own territory. Intriguingly, most are accompanied by beautiful snow maidens. Scroll down for video . Santa summit (l to r): Ekhe Dyyl, Grandfather Frost and Chyskhaan discuss who has been naughty and nice in an ice cave. Snow maiden Kharchaana accompanied Ekhe on the visit . Quite often at this time of year, some of these colourful Russian figures meet for friendly Santa summits, occasionally in a real ice cave. Their expressions may be serious, but all of them aim to bring happiness and - more often than not - gifts to children who are well behaved... Grandfather Frost - or Ded Moroz . Best known across Russia is Grandfather Frost - or Ded Moroz - who often carries a magical staff and is often accompanied by his snow maiden - Snegurochka. He is the one who looks most like our own Father Christmas, yet there are also key differences. For example, his busiest night is New Year's Eve with presents arriving at midnight. The busiest night of the year for Grandfather Frost (right) is New Year's Eve when he delivers presents at midnight. He is often accompanied by his snow maiden, Snegurochka . He often visits excited children in their homes or at parties before New Year's Eve, and since the end of Soviet times, he also appears in some flats and houses to mark Orthodox Christmas Eve and Christmas Day on January 6 and 7. Usually he is in red, but he is sometimes seen in blue or very occasionally white. His traditional mode of transport is a sleigh pulled, not by reindeer, but white horses. Over the years, though, he has also resorted to the Metro and trams. Clambering down chimneys, though, is not for him. Grandfather Frost has a large wardrobe. He is usually dressed in red, like our own Father Christmas, but is sometimes seen wearing blue and occasionally white . Traditionally, in deep history Ded Moroz wandered around the forest, controlling the frost, bringing presents to the good, and punishments to the bad. Unlike Santa, Grandfather Frost gives his gifts openly when he arrives with a big sack of presents. Typically, children need to show him how good they are, often reciting a poem or singing a song before he hands over the gifts, assisted by Snegurochka. He lives not at the North Pole but in the town of Veliky Ustyug, in northern Russia, well shy of the Arctic. It is here the Russian Post Office delivers his mail, but with this being such a large country, he has regional residences, for example at Royev Ruchey Zoo in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. Grandfather Frost's birthday is November 18, the coldest day ever recorded in the town of Veliky Ustyug. The glamorous Snegurochka was originally a character from ancient fairy tales who became part of the Christmas ritual in the late 19th century. She remained when Stalin permitted Grandfather Frost to return two decades after the Russian Revolution. Chyskhaan, aka the King of the Cold . Children in Russia's largest region, the vast Sakha Republic in Siberia, are also familiar with the magnificent blue-coated Chyskhaan. Every year, in late September and early October, he makes his way south from the Arctic Ocean to the diamond region of Sakha, also known Yakutia. 'And with his every step comes cold,' tells native Yakutian, Olga Stepanova. The region can sink below minus 60C. At an annual conclave with Grandfather Frost, he hands over the cold each winter. These dashing Santas are Ekhe Dyyl (left),  known for riding a bull and carries a sack of presents, and Chyskhaan (right), who hands over the cold to Grandfather Frost each winter . He has two horns, by legend one from a bull, the other from a woolly mammoth. 'Then at the end January his first horn falls off, and in middle February his second horn,' she explained. As the snow melts, he floats back to the Arctic in the Lena River before the ritual is repeated the following winter. Ekhe Dyyl . Yet another Santa-like figure is seen in this region, the coldest in Russia. This is Ekhe Dyyl (pictured above), who shares a granddaughter, Khaarchana, with Chyskhaan. She likes to play with children but can only do so around New Year - the time when presents are exchanged. At other periods, she wears a hat that makes her invisible. The bearded Ekhe Dyyl rides a bull, and carries a sack of presents, while Khaarchana goes around on a reindeer called Buur. Sagaan Ubugul or White Elder . Another of the Siberian Santas is Sagaan Ubugul or White Elder, who is seen in the Buddhist republic of Buryatia. He has a white beard and carries a stick with a dragon's head. Sagaan Ubugul is another of the seven Santas and is known for giving sweets and candles to children in the Buddhist republic of Buryatia . His duties fall later than the others since the New Year is celebrated according to the lunar calendar in late January or early February. He invites children and adults to Lake Baikal - the oldest lake in the world - and the gifts he bestows are health, love, family and wealth to the deserving. To children he gives candles and sweets. Sook Irey . In the southern Siberian republic of Tyva is a Santa who - like our own - is able to fly over the rooftops. There is no sleigh nor any reindeer but Sook Irey flies to houses and yurts bringing gifts to children at New Year. Snacking Santas (l to r): Sagaan Ubugul, Sook Irey, Tugeny Eneken, accompanied by a snow maiden . 'His body, arms, legs consist of ice,' according to one description. 'He looks cold and tired. His hair, eyebrows, and beard covered with white frost like all the trees and bushes. 'His clothes are white, blue, reminiscent of the ice.' Yet while he looks old and worn, he can turn into a young man or beautiful girl, as the mood takes him. 'But he cannot warm anyone. He can only freeze,' according to the Tyva Legend of Creation. He can be accompanied by Tugeni Eneken - Mother Winter from Evenkia. Kysh Babayi . Kysh Babayi has quite an entourage, including his pretty snow maiden, Kar Kyzy . On the Western fringes of Siberia, in the largely Muslim regions of Tatarstan and Bashkiriya, is the preserve of the magical figure of Kysh Babayi, dressed in blue and seen by some as a brother to Ded Moroz. He is accompanied by Kar Kyzy - his snow maiden - but also by a veritable collection of others, notably golden haired Altynchech - a female warrior; Takhir and Zukhra, described as a Tatar Romeo and Juliet; Shaytan, the embodiment of evil; and Batyr, a strong man. Like Ded Moroz, he distributes presents as the New Year dawns. Yamal Iri . While most owe their origins to old traditions, Yamal Iri - who rides a sleigh pulled by reindeer and dresses in blue - is a much newer creation. He started presiding over Christmas in the gas-rich Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous region of northern Siberia as recently as 2007. Yamal Iri is the youngest of the seven Santas of Siberia, first appearing as late as 2007 . Yamal Iri is much like our own Santa, riding a sleigh pulled by reindeer. However his boots are made from reindeer skins and he carries a drum to drive away evil spirits . However, his character is based on old legends and he arrives with a drum made from reindeer skin to drive away evil spirits. As well as presenting gifts to children, he spreads positive energy and brings midwinter happiness. He lives in the Arctic, at Gornoknyazevsk village, some nine miles from the city of Salekhard, on the bank of the Ob River. His traditional costume and boots are made from reindeer skins and his belt decorated with bones from woolly mammoths. Putin with Ded Moroz in 2008 . In December 2008, a Kremlin official claimed that Father Christmas was an 'imposter' and an 'illegal immigrant'. Speaker of the Russian Parliament Boris Gryzlov insisted that the only authentic figure for bringing presents to Russia's children was Ded Moroz - Grandfather Frost. Mr Gryzlov was at Velikiy Ustyug, traditional home of Ded Moroz in the far north of the country, when he said: 'No one will ever be able to take away Ded Moroz from Russia - not Santa Claus nor any other imposters.' Behind his attacks on Santa Claus - whom he urged to 'get out of the profession, at least in Russia' - was a fear of encroaching Western influences which led to battles in the streets between Santas dressed in white beards and red coats and Ded Morozes dressed in blue. Although he is popular now, life was not always easy for Ded Moroz. He was persecuted under Stalin, being branded a 'priest's ally' in 1928. At the same time, Christmas trees were banned in the early years of the USSR. Stalin, however, relented and in 1937 Ded Moroz was rehabilitated, returning in triumph to the Moscow Palace of Unions.","Grandfather Frost carries a magic staff and visits on New Year's Eve .

"Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said more than half of schools promised rebuilds could still be awaiting work at the end of 2017 . David Cameron’s flagship school building programme is way off track, Labour claimed last night. Despite promising in 2012 that a total of 261 promised rebuilds would ‘begin immediately’, work has started at just 63 of them. Only 14 school buildings have been handed over for use under Mr Cameron’s priority school building programme. It means that over three quarters of schools promised rebuilds from this Government are still waiting for work to start three years and five months after the programme was first launched. But last night the Conservatives hit back - denying the scheme was behind schedule, and pointing out that it was managing to build schools a third cheaper than under Labour. A Tory source said: ‘Labour must have been at the Christmas sherry. ‘It’s remarkable to be attacked by them for the state of school building. The fact is we’re building schools quicker and cheaper than under their wasteful programme, saving taxpayers around £5million per school. ‘If they really want to have a fight on this ground then that’s fine by us.’ However, shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said that if progress on school building continues at the current rate, more than half of those schools promised rebuilds could still be awaiting work to start by the deadline of the end of 2017. He said: ‘This just goes to show that David Cameron’s Priority School Building Programme is decidedly not a priority for this Government, limping along at a staggeringly slow pace,’ he said. ‘On top of this, the Tory-led government’s decision to divert scarce resources away from areas desperately in need of more school places in order to fund their flawed Free School programme, has meant that more and more pupils up and down the country are being crammed into makeshift temporary classrooms. ‘David Cameron desperately needs to get a grip on the crisis he is creating in schools and ensure school buildings and classrooms are fit for our children to learn in.’ In July 2011, the government launched its replacement for Labour’s ‘Building Schools for the Future’ scheme after they scrapped it – the Priority Schools Building Programme. In May of the following year, the then Education Secretary Michael Gove announced that work would begin ‘immediately’ on 261 schools that would have their condition needs met through the programme. It is three years and five months since David Cameron's flagship school building programme was launched, and over two and a half years since Michael Gove announced that work would begin ‘immediately’ It is now three years and five months since the programme was launched, and over two and a half years since Mr Gove announced that work would begin ‘immediately’. But earlier this month, schools minister David Laws told the Commons: ‘Under the Priority School Building Programme we have now signed construction contracts for 63 schools. ‘Eight schools have opened in new buildings since October 2014. This brings the total number of schools open in new buildings to 14. ‘Construction work is continuing at a number of these schools to demolish the old dilapidated buildings.’ Labour said that if progress was to continue at this rate - 63 schools since the programme’s launch 41 months ago; then more than half of those schools promised rebuilds would still be awaiting work to start by the deadline of the end of 2017. That is 36 months from now. Last night the Coalition pointed out that school buildings are now being constructed for about a third less, saving the taxpayer millions of pounds. Last night a spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘It is nonsense to suggest the Priority School Building Programme is behind schedule. ‘We are working with all 260 schools in the programme – 14 are open, 59 are being built, 64 contracts have been signed, and the others are in various stages of development. ‘Under the previous school building initiative, BSF, it took three years for building work to begin. Under the PSBP this time was slashed to one year. And the average secondary school now costs around £5million less to build, saving vital taxpayers’ money.’","The PM’s flagship school building programme is way off track, Labour say .

"A report reveals highly qualified working mothers are being excluded from full-time jobs because they lack flexibility. File photo . Highly qualified mothers are being excluded from full-time jobs because of a lack of flexibility in the work place, according to a report. The survey revealed that two-thirds of employed women were unable to adjust the time they start or finish work. And a quarter said it was difficult to take an hour or two off work to attend to personal matters at short notice. The report by the IPPR think-tank said the UK had a ‘particular problem’ with a lack of part-time work in skilled jobs for highly qualified workers compared to other countries. It means many women with children in Britain are working part time in jobs below their skills level. Women in Sweden and the Netherlands are more able to adapt their working hours than those in the UK, said the report. More than two-fifths of women who work part time do so mainly to take care of children or disabled adults, compared with 6 per cent of men, said IPPR. The report revealed that a third of women in part-time jobs were not happy with the amount of hours they work. The research also showed that women who work part time in the UK are seven times more likely to let care duties dictate their working hours than men in part-time jobs. Dalia Ben-Galim, associate director of IPPR, said: ‘Employers are missing out on top talent and highly qualified women are working in low-skilled jobs. ‘That’s a missed opportunity for both employers and employees. ‘How work is arranged, and employees’ level of autonomy over working hours, can have a big impact on how well people reconcile paid work with other commitments.’ The survey revealed two-thirds of employed women were unable to adjust the time they start or finish work. File photo . She continued: ‘An important indicator for flexibility is how employees’ hours are set, and who has control over this. ‘For example, fixed starting times set by an employer may conflict with the varying and changing needs of families. ‘Flexible working in its current, reduced-hours form simply isn’t flexible enough. ‘The prevalence of rigid scheduling, especially in low-income jobs, often means that even reduced hours work is not sufficient for meeting the more spontaneous demands of care-giving.’","A quarter of employed women said it was difficult to take time off to attend to personal matters at short notice .

"Labour has accused the Tories of breaking a pre-election promise as it emerged that the vast majority of rail services will not be running today. Seventeen major operators are offering no trains at all while the rest have only limited or Sunday services – causing misery for the public on a day when many families, as well as sports fans, will be trying to travel. The Boxing Day shutdown comes despite the fact that the Conservatives in opposition repeatedly complained about a lack of rail services on the day after Christmas. Railway lines will be empty today as seventeen train operators are not operating a service on Boxing Day . Football fans and  shoppers were left furious today as many were left unable to get to matches or the Boxing Day sales. QPR fans hit out at South West Trains on Twitter as no services ran from into London from the western suburbs and towns. Manchester United fans living outside the city are also selling their tickets online because Virgin Trains are not running services. A Twitter user called Neil Armstrong wrote: 'Wish Virgin Trains would join the rest of us in the 21st Century and run a service today.' He added: 'Given how much Virgin Trains hike prices for football fans, there must be serious profit to be made today.' And a woman in eastern England tweeted: 'Just got to the train station for Boxing Day sales to find out there are no trains. Are you having a laugh Greater Anglia?' Labour said the shutdown showed the Tories’ hypocrisy that four and a half years after taking power, they have done nothing to improve the situation. In opposition, in 2008 and 2009, the Tories accused Labour of not having the ‘interest of the travelling public at heart’. But this year, there are almost no Boxing Day rail services across the country. A list showing the services each of the country's rail providers are running today the day after Christmas . Michael Dugher, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: ‘The travelling public are facing misery on Boxing Day as yet again ministers have allowed the rail network to shut down for the day. Before the last General Election, the Tories repeatedly criticised the lack of rail services on Boxing Day. ‘But it is clear they have done absolutely nothing about it in government. Yet again, this Tory-led Government has been shown to be all talk and no action.’ The low level of service contrasts sharply with the demands of former Tory transport spokesman Stephen Hammond – now a transport minister – who in 2008 called for an increase in Boxing Day rail services. He said at the time: ‘Boxing Day is a traditional sporting fixture across the country for many sports, not just football. 'Families and football fans will be given no choice but to get into their cars, pump more CO2 into the atmosphere and put up with potentially eye-watering levels of congestion because the railways remain shut.’ Football fans took to Twitter this morning to complain about being unable to get to Boxing Day matches . A year later he repeated the attack, saying: ‘If Labour had the interest of the travelling public at heart they would not cut people off from the railway at the very time when they need a fast, reliable and pleasant way to travel long distance across the UK.’ Yet today’s virtual shutdown comes on the fifth Boxing Day since the Conservatives took office and the third since Mr Hammond was appointed as a transport minister. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ‘Deciding the level of service on specific days is a matter for train operators. But we know passengers want to travel on Boxing Day, and that’s why we have worked with the rail industry to ensure there are limited services on some franchises on that day. ‘Network Rail and train companies have ensured that a large part of the railway will remain open over the Christmas/New Year period and alternative routes are provided where the lines are closed for essential engineering work, and that these are communicated properly to the public.’ Today's virtual rail shutdown comes on the fifth Boxing Day since the Conservatives took office and a third since Stephen Hammond became transport minister .","Seventeen major operators are not offering trains at all today, Boxing Day .
The rest are only running a limited or Sunday service for travellers .
Closure causing misery for families and sports fans trying to travel .
Conservatives in opposition had complained about a lack of services .
Now Labour have accused the party of break a pre-election promise .
Shutdown is the fifth consecutive year  since Conservatives took office ."
"Jailed: Grandmother-of-two Carla Buckle was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after she was taken to court for failing to pay £3,500 in council tax . A grandmother-of-two who was jailed over unpaid council tax was freed just in time to spend Christmas at home with her family after an online appeal raised enough money to pay off her debts. Carla Buckle was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after she was taken to court for failing to pay £3,500 in council tax. But, just 48 hours before Christmas, the 52-year-old was released from HMP Bronzefield near Ashford, Surrey, after supporters donated more than £1,500 to cover the remainder of her bill. A viral online campaign was launched to free the grandmother, on the grounds that she was on a low income and devoted her time to caring for others in her community. Mrs Buckle, of Newbury, Berkshire, was said to be a carer on a zero-hours contract, earning just £7 an hour for around 25 hours a week. It was claimed that this left her without the means to pay the bill from West Berkshire Council. The man who led the campaign to free the grandmother said she had been 'overwhelmed' with the support she had received. He said: 'She was over the moon, absolutely overwhelmed with all the support and the work that has been going on behind the scenes to get her released. She was quite unaware of it. 'She's back home now. She's having a lovely Christmas with her family.' When she was jailed at Reading Magistrates' Court on November 18, it was only the second time the district council had been granted a custodial sentence for the non-payment of council tax. Mrs Buckle owed £3,500 in council tax at the time, which was reduced by £60 for each day she was in prison. Speaking at the time of the conviction, the council's executive member for finance, Alan Law, said: 'We are all obliged to pay council tax to cover the cost of numerous essential services and it is totally unfair for some people to think that this shared responsibility does not apply to them. 'I hope that this sentence gives a clear message that expecting others to pay will not be tolerated.' Campaigners insisted Mrs Buckle was a civilian, not a criminal, who had been held in unlawful custody. An online petition calling for her release garnered 1,671 signatures. Home for Christmas: Just 48 hours before Christmas, 52-year-old Mrs Buckle was released from HMP Bronronzefield Ashford, Surrey, after supporters donated more than £1,500 to cover the remainder of her bill . Taking action: An online campaign was launched to free the grandmother, on the grounds that she was on a low income and gave her time to caring for others in her community. Above, West Berkshire Council offices . The High Court review granted the mother-of-three immediate bail and a judicial review application will be heard in January. A West Berkshire Council spokesman said they had simply brought the case forward to try to retrieve the money and the court decided the sentence. The council and the prison where Mrs Buckle was held said they could not comment any further on individual cases. Speaking ahead of Mrs Buckle's release, her spokesman said: 'We have been invited to turn up with cash at the prison and pay Carla's council tax bill to them directly - and she will be released immediately. 'How utterly ridiculous in 2014 - we still have the Poor Laws in operation and debtors' private prisons. 'It's completely against Carla's human and constitutional rights to be jailed for a debt she cannot afford and has no contract for.' Writing on Facebook, Mrs Buckle thanked her supporters and said she was grieving for her uncle who had passed away while she was behind bars. She said: 'To everyone that wrote to me and have sent me messages, I am not ignoring you and will get back to everyone in the near future and hope you understand that I am busy helping the heroes that put time and effort at the expense of pushing their own social lives aside for me and their sleep, to put a case together and get me out of hell. 'I'm also recovering from my traumatic experience and grieving for my uncle and saddened I couldn't be with my mother at such as sad time when she needed me the most.'","Carla Buckle, 52, was taken to court after not paying £3,500 in council tax .

"Berkeley, Missouri is preparing for a third night of protests after the death of a black teenager at the hands of a white police officer on Tuesday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, crowds swarmed the gas station where 18-year-old Antonio Martin was shot dead to protest the killing. The demonstrations became violent and led to several arrests. Hours after Martin's death, authorities released surveillance footage from the gas station that they said showed the teenager raise a gun at a police officer, who was in the area responding to a robbery call. The officer, who has not been named, shot him dead. On Twitter on Christmas Day, there continued to be calls for protests in the St Louis suburb, which is just three miles from where Michael Brown was shot by a white cop in Ferguson in August. Protests: A relative of Antonio Martin, the teenager who was shot dead by police on Tuesday, addresses protesters and the media on Wednesday close to where he was gunned down in Berkeley, Missouri . Demonstrators: Protesters engage in a 'die in' at the gas station on Wednesday in protest of the death . Clash: A woman walks with police on Wednesday. Police made several arrests last night . Fears: A store is seen boarded up after protesters attempted to break in in Berkeley, Missouri on Thursday . On Christmas Eve, the night started calmly, with fewer than 100 people, including Martin's grieving mother Toni Martin, turning out for a candle light vigil for the teen at the gas station. They then marched through town and onto Interstate 170, forcing police to block off traffic and shut down the major St. Louis-area thoroughfare. Violent history: Police say Antonio Martin raised a gun at the officer before the officer shot him dead . Some of the protesters turned violent as the night wore on. Several nearby storefronts were damaged during what appeared to be the start of a small riot. At least one store, a local beauty salon, was broken into - though police chased away looters before they could make it inside. Gunshots could be heard in the parking lot, according to videos posted on social media. Six to eight people were arrested, Berkeley Police Chief Frank McCall said, and more than 40 officers were on hand to restore order. Also on Wednesday night, a mass shooting outside a 7-Eleven in downtown St. Louis left one person dead and three people critically injured. The incident appears to be unrelated to Wednesday's protests. The protests were not nearly as violent or as large as on Tuesday night - when more than 300 furious people converged on the Mobil station within hours of the shooting. The protests turned violent when someone set off an explosive next to a gas pump. Another protester lit firecrackers. Several angry members of the mob lobbed rocks and bricks at officers. Four people were arrested and at least two officers were injured - including one who was caught in the bomb blast. Police say that Martin pulled a loaded handgun on the officer without warning while the cop was talking to him and a friend in the parking lot of the Mobil on Tuesday night. Peaceful: Early on Wednesday night, Martin's mother Toni and father, Jerome Green, right, took part in a candlelight vigil at the gas station . By the end of the night on Wednesday, the protests turned violent. At least one store was broken into, several others were damaged and police made several arrests. No shops were actually looted, however . Blocking traffic: Protesters stopped cars in the road and refused to let traffic pass . Anger: A man holds back protesters who were pursuing a lone officer at the strip mall near the scene . Speaking out: Protesters shut down Airport Road in Berkeley during the protests on Wednesday . The officer stumbled backward, dropped his flashlight and fired as he fell to the ground. On Wednesday, they released surveillance footage showing the police officer running. One of the shots hit Martin and killed him. One went into the tire of the officer's squad car. The third bullet has not been found. Martin did not open fire on the officer after pulling the gun, police say, but Mayor Theodore Hoskins said he believed the officer's actions potentially saved his life. Police are still looking for the second suspect from the evening - who can been seen in surveillance video sprinting away at full speed when the shooting starts. Despite the three videos and the photos of the gun, Martin's family and many supporters don't believe the version of events that police are offering. Martin's grandmother, Margret Chandler, 65, told the Los Angeles Times: 'If he was in the wrong, I want to know he was in the wrong. I want to see the gun in his hand. Fleeing for his life: The officer is seen in newly released surveillance camera footage falling to the ground after Antonio Martin pulled a gun on him, according to police. He then runs to the other side of the gas station . Police say that as the officer fell, he fired three shots - one of which hit Martin and killed him. Martin, who is off screen, had pulled a loaded pistol on the officer without warning, police say . 'I don't want them to tell me he had it. I want to see it. These police do some dirty things. They just wait until nightfall to see some young black men and gun them down.' The shooting two days before Christmas comes at a time when tensions between the black community and police are at their highest in recent memory. The decision by the grand jury in St. Louis not to indict the officer in Mike Brown's death - along with other failures to indict in high-profile cases - sparked mass protests and fury over alleged police brutality across the country. The anger at police took a horrific turn on Saturday when two New York officers were executed in their squad car by a man who said he was targeting cops as revenge for the deaths of Brown and New York chokehold victim Eric Garner. The death of Martin, a young black man, at the hands of a white police officer sparked immediate comparisons to Ferguson and other cases where police have been accused of using excessive force. A memorial of flowers and stuffed animals has cropped up near the spot where Martin was killed. One mourner posted a sign that said, 'They can't kill us all.' 'They can't kill us all': The killing on Antonio Martin drew immediate comparisons to the death of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson and other cases where police brutality has been alleged . Berkeley Mayor Theordore Hoskins said on Wednesday that the killing was not the same situation as the death of Michael Brown . Martin's girlfriend, Keanna, leaves a message on a makeshift memorial outside  the Mobil gas station . But speaking about the death on Wednesday morning, Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said that the incident should not draw comparisons with the death of Brown, who was unarmed and whose death was not caught on camera. Mayor Hoskins, who himself is black, added that Berkeley has a predominantly African American police force so his officers are more sensitive to race relations than officers in Ferguson. He said that after hearing that a black teenager had been shot by a white officer last night, his first reaction was that it was another case of police brutality. But after finding out what happened, 'I can assure you that did not happen last night', he said. 'Everybody don't die the same,' he said. 'Some people die because police initiate it. Some people die because they initiate it. At this point, our review indicated that the police did not initiate this.' The officer who shot Martin is on administrative leave. The 34-year-old officer, a six-year veteran of the force, did not have his body camera switched on. Clash: Police scuffled with as many as 300 protesters at the scene after the shooting on Tuesday . Dangerous: Three explosives were detonated, police said, including one right next to a gas pump at the station . The front entrance to a shop on the opposite side of the street, pictured, was damaged amid scuffles . Location: The scene of Mr Martin's shooting is only about three miles from where Michael Brown was shot in August .","Antonio Brown, a black 18-year-old, was shot dead on Tuesday night by a white officer at a gas station in Berkeley, Missouri - a St. Louis suburb .

"A council is set to build a £12,000 'noise barrier' at a children's playground - because the sound of youngsters having fun is too loud. Bakewell Recreation Ground in Derbyshire hit headlines last June after it was closed following a single complaint about the noise of children playing. But after a public outcry, Derbyshire Dales County Council bowed to pressure and re-opened the facility - reinstating the original opening times. Controversial: Bakewell Recreation Ground in Derbyshire is set to feature a two-metre high £12,000 'sound barrier' around its perimeter because the sound of children playing is too loud . They will now spend thousands of pounds erecting an accoustic sound barrier measuring two metres high and 13.5 metres long to cut the noise. They came to the decision after sound monitoring showed the noise levels in the playground were unacceptably high over a six week period. Using LA90 noise measurements, the level of sound coming from the play area when it was not in operation was between 46dB (decibels) and 49dB. A six-week experiment at the playground in Bakewell Recreation Ground recorded noise levels of 57 decibels when children were playing. This was deemed too loud. Noise is measured in units called decibels (dB). The higher the number in decibels, the louder the noise. Here is a list of noises with their relevant decibel levels. Aircraft at take-off: 180 . Fireworks: 140 . Snowmobile 120 . Chain saw: 110 . Amplified music: 110 . Lawn mower: 90 . Noisy office: 90 . Vacuum cleaner: 80 . City traffic: 80 . Normal conversation: 60 . Refrigerator humming: 40 . Whisper: 20 . Leaves rustling: 10 . Calm breathing: 10 . Source: Hearing Aid Know . When the play area was in use however, the noise levels rose to an average of between 56dB and 57dB. It is estimated that the accoustic sound barrier would cut the noise by 7.1dB. The cost of the screen would be paid for out of the council's capital programme. Additionally it was recommended that a landscaped shrub border be planted to address the issue of parents allowing their children to urinate next to residents gardens - at a cost of approximately £2,500. The committee also agreed that further noise monitoring may be carried out on the site in the future to determine the effectiveness of the screen and whether it was necessary to install a second screen. At the meeting councillors were told the cost of relocating the wet play area would be around £100,000. At a meeting of the council's environment committee on Thursday, Councillor Peter Slack commented: 'On the site visit we could see the different issues involved in it and all these recommendations are the answer.' The committee passed the recommendations, which included a provision that further noise monitoring may be carried out on the site in the future to determine the effectiveness of the screen and whether it was necessary to install a second screen. Speaking at the time the play area was shut, Kate Hunt, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, who went to the park with mother Jayne, son George and niece Molly, both aged four, said: 'I can't believe one person can ruin so many children's fun. Stunned: Kate Hunt, of Sheffield, who often visits the park with her son George, (pictured) was shocked when the playground was closed in June following a single complaint about the noise . 'We've been visiting the park for years so were shocked to find the wet area closed - it was particularly upsetting for George and Molly. 'Upon investigating we were told the opening hours had been reduced due to one nearby resident complaining about the noise of children playing. 'It's beyond belief someone would complain about children having fun - I'm sure the traffic noise from the main road is far more disruptive.'","Bakewell Recreation Ground in Derbyshire temporarily closed in June .

"While some of the nation's top politicians record standard Christmas messages for the country,  Julie Bishop has opted for a more modern day approach. The Foreign Minister took to Twitter on Christmas morning to wish everyone a happy holiday with the help of a few emojis. Her message included Christmas trees, presents, Santa Claus, family and music - the key elements for the festive season. Scroll down for video . At work and play: Julie Bishop arriving at the House of Representatives (left) and in Melbourne for Cup Day channelling Carrie Bradshaw . The Foreign Minister took to Twitter on Christmas morning to wish everyone a happy holiday with the help of a few emojis . But many humorously opted to relate Ms Bishop's tweet to same-sex marriage equality after she included emojis of two women and two men holding hands. '@JulieBishopMP I like how you have included same sex couple emojis in your Christmas tweet #marriageequality #auspol,' one person tweeted. 'Nobody tell Julie that these aren't brothers and sisters,' another wrote. It isn't the first time the politician has taken over Twitter with emojis. She spent three hours replying to her thousands of Twitter followers using nothing but the small pictures earlier this year. Ms Bishop's popularity has doubled in recent months ranking her on par with the prime minister as preferred Liberal leader and she was named 'Woman of the Year' by Harper's Bazaar magazine in November. Julie Bishop leaving a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop in Canberra . The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security this year. Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine. The Foreign Minister was further regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies. Ms Bishop was also listed as one of the 50 most powerful women in Australia of 2014 by the Australian Women's Weekly. She told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'living then dream and loving the job'. 'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said. 'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.' The 58-year-old politician is a fan of ‘investment pieces’ such as Armani suits . Ms Bishop accessorises with brooches in a look inspired by US politician Hilary Clinton . She's a big fan of Louis Vuitton and Christian Louboutin heels - particularly the red stiletto kind . Ms Bishop revealed due to high demanding job, she only gets four hours sleep a night but still manages to fit in a workout each day. While she famously wears Giorgio Armani suits and has a love for pearl necklaces, a departmental document reveals many of the other requests that follow Ms Bishop all over the world in her role as Foreign Minister. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document contains insider information on her non-stop professional life and personal preferences when travelling. The note shows that Ms Bishop leads a healthy lifestyle, saying that she is a 'non-smoker', and 'prefers to eat healthily but not a fussy eater and open to try local foods. The document also makes note of her love of running, saying under 'Personal Time' that she requests '1 hour (early morning) for exercise.' Ms Bishop, seen here with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, believes it's her duty to dress in a way that promotes the best image of Australia . Julie Bishop arrives looking glamorous at the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House in Canberra . During her treasured half an hour 6km daily run she dons 2XU and Asics sports gear . Her morning jogs have become known among other foreign staff, who often join her in her precious sole hour of 'alone time' in her hectic day. The minister is also not a coffee drinker, despite only sleeping for four hours a night, noting that 'We don't have time for that'. She prefers 'English Breakfast tea with skim milk or peppermint tea', but isn't demanding, noting that there is 'no need to provide in hotel room.' Ms Bishop 'Prefers sparkling water, however will drink wine or Champagne at appropriate functions,' the document states. The Foreign Minister also likes to be prepared for small talk as well as large issues, with the document revealing that she likes to be given a 'snippet' of local information 'to start conversation with interlocuters', and gives the example of meeting New York Mayor as 'Yankees scraped into the finals this week'. It is also important for her to have gift wrap, scissors, and tape on hand, in order to wrap presents she might need to present to hosts or other leaders. Julie Bishop thanked her staff with this emoji-filled tweet earlier this month . The Foreign Minister is a big fan of brooches like those worn by Hillary Clinton . The Foreign Affairs Minister spent three hours entertaining her 85,000 Twitter followers by replying in nothing but emojis . The requests continued to roll in, pushing the Foreign Affairs Minister to see just how far she'd take the online joke . The jokes continued on until just after 11pm when the Foreign Minister, clearly knackered from keeping up with today's youth, wrote the following Tweet .","Julie Bishop took to Twitter on Christmas morning to wish everyone a happy holiday with the help of a few emojis .

"Bacall, Gabe, Chief, Michonne, Bindi, Bogey and Piper have been given a home - just in time for the holidays. The brood of seven puppies were only two-days-old when they were found dumped in a trash contained outside a Radio Shack in Susanville, California. Their eyes were still closed, their umbilical cords still attached and each weighed about one pound. But after being found, they were taken in by the Pet Network Humane Society in Incline Village, Nevada, who worked around-the-clock to make sure they survived, The L.A. Times reported. Scroll down for video . Dumped: These seven puppies were found in a trash container in Susanville, California, with their umbilical cords still attached, but were taken in by the Pet Network Humane Society in Incline Village, Nevada . 'We're a small shelter, and we are able to do around-the-clock care,' Pet Network Human Society worker Melissa Shaw told The Times. 'And that's what these puppies needed. 'They were extremely small. Most of them were all black, and some had little spots of white. 'We later determined they were a mix of German shepherd, black Lab and golden retriever. 'But that first day, they were muted little creatures, just clinging to life.' Around-the-clock care: The dogs were so young and so close to death, they needed 24-hour care . Feeding: The pups were bottle fed every two hours until they were healthy enough to feed themselves . Despite being left for dead, the dogs kept fighting. 'At first, they weren't even little balls of fur yet,' Shaw said. 'They had short hair. 'They looked like hamsters, but with these little scrunched-up faces.' Because of the work involved in looking after seven sick puppies, the shelter put them in the care of 'surrogate' volunteers, who were instructed how to act like the animals' mother, such as rubbing their stomachs to prompt them to go to the bathroom. 'With puppies that young and no access to mother's milk, we had to improvise,' Shaw said. 'Luckily, we have great foster families who took them home for round-the-clock care — night feeds, all of the stuff you do with an infant.' Healthy: Workers at the Nevada animal shelter described the dogs as fighters for pushing through . As the pups got bigger, talk of them spread, and people started lining up to see them. That progressed to people lining up to take them home. Soon there was a waiting list of prospective owners. One family, the Wolfords, read about the dogs online and, touched by the story, were determined to give one a good home. Mom Kaelan Wolford called the shelter and said: 'Just because you have a lot of families in line doesn't mean they're the best family. We're the best family.' The shelter agreed, and the Wolfords took home Chief. Mrs Wolford said the process has taught her children an important lesson about the good and the bad people in the world.

Passenger Lauri Springer live tweeted the ordeal after the pilot said there was a 'security issue' Ms Springer said she learned there was a problem on board when the pilot informed passengers that the aircraft was turning around due to a ‘security issue’. When the plane arrived at the gate police officers boarded the aircraft and detained a disruptive passenger who was making threats, she said. The University of Alabama student, who was heading to California for a  family holiday, wrote in a tweet: ‘And then everyone applauded the police officers and pilot and flight attendants for handling it so well.’ The disruptive passenger was not charged with a crime but he was not allowed back on the plane . Passenger Lauri Springer was heading to California for a family holiday when the incident occurred . The plane spent around two hours in Albuquerque before resuming its journey to Los Angeles . Airport spokesman Daniel Jiron told The Albuquerque Journal that Sunport police arrested the passenger once Delta Flight 81 landed. Mr Jiron told the newspaper that he doesn't know the nature of the incident that made the pilot feel he had to land the plane. He said the FBI was called, which is standard in such situations. The passenger was not charged but he was not allowed back on the plane when it departed for Los Angeles around two hours later. Passengers had spent nearly seven hours on the plane before they finally arrived in Los Angeles.","Boeing 767 was forced to land in Albuquerque due to security threat .

"Homeless thief Nathan Dorsett, 30, stole from Oxford University colleges because it was 'better than burgling people's homes' A serial thief who carried out a string of burglaries at Oxford University colleges because it was 'better than burgling people's homes' has been jailed. Nathan Dorsett broke into the historic colleges to steal students' wallets, electrical items and even food from canteens and a buffet. The 30-year-old homeless man was caught when he was found on campus with a crowbar and bolt croppers in his bag. He was recognised from a wanted poster police had put up around the university and detained by staff at Mansfield College until police arrived to arrest him. A judge heard that Dorsett had stolen a range of personal items from Oxford colleges during a series of break-ins in July and August this year. He climbed over a fence into St John's College - previously attended by alumni including Tony Blair - stealing a handbag, wallet and a mobile phone from a room. The next day he entered St Catherine's College, where he went into the canteen and ate food, before climbing through a window in Balliol College to steal a ring and cameras. When inside St Catherine's, Dorsett headed for a buffet, eating and drinking refreshments which were laid out for a conference. He also stole electrical items from St Anthony's College, in Woodstock Road, on August 25. Dorsett admitted four counts of burglary, one count of theft and one count of being equipped to steal. He was sentenced  at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday afternoon to two years and four months in jail. Dorsett stole a handbag, wallet and a mobile phone from a room at St John's College, once attended by Tony Blair . Dorsett, at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), admitted four counts of burglary, one count of theft and one count of being equipped to steal and was jailed for two years and four months . Dorsett had previously been given a 23-week suspended sentence for handling stolen goods at Birmingham and Solihull Magistrates' Court on August 20, which will run consecutively with his new sentence. Five other burglary offences at colleges - two committed in Oxford, two in York and one in Norfolk - were taken into consideration. PC Jennifer Hanks, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Dorsett had not only been targeting Oxford but had travelled around the country by train and had committed burglaries in other university towns and cities as he did not feel this was as bad as breaking into peoples' homes. However, during these incidents he stole personal belongings and stole from educational organisations. 'This custodial sentence means he will no longer be able to commit similar offences.'","Nathan Dorsett launched string of burglaries at Oxford University colleges .

"A Louisiana man gave his newborn son a name just like his own, but instead of simply calling him 'Junior,' Jack Daniels named his son Jim Beam. Jack Daniels Leathers, 31, was just turning rebellion into tradition. 'My parents decided they wanted to name their son something to make their parents mad,' Jack told Houma Today. Newborn: A Louisiana man gave his newborn son a name just like his own, but instead of simply calling him 'Junior,' Jack Daniels named his son Jim Beam . 'And, at the time, my dad was drinking Jack, which he enjoyed,' he explained. 'My mom said, ""Why not?""' 'Nobody believed my name until I showed them my ID,' Jack said about the name, which also made him popular during his time in the military. 'When I went into the Army, sergeants would yell, ""How much more American can you get than Jack Daniels?""' 'I went through most of my Army career not hearing my last name because people would call me Jack Daniels, he said.' Jack brought up the story of his name on his first date with Lydia, and the couple decided then to name their first-born Jim Beam, after the Kentucky bourbon. They even kept the beverage theme running through their wedding, which was officiated by Houma's Judge Johnny Walker. Fallen: Jack and his wife Lydia were already talking baby names on their first date, and decided then on Jim Beam .

I just went along with it.'","Jack Daniels Leathers, 31, named his newborn son Jim Beam .

"Andy Murray appeared simply delighted on Christmas Day as he threw on a festive jumper for the seasonal celebrations. The 27-year-old tennis star, who is almost as famous for his dry wit as his ability with a racket, took to Twitter to show off his new apparel.

Andy Murray dons an Alexis Sanchez shirt while his brother Jamie (right) wears a Manchester United strip . Murray was enjoying a rare day off with his family at Christmas, and was showing off another new piece of attire earlier  - an Arsenal shirt with Alexis Sanchez on the back. Brother Jamie, meanwhile, was given a Manchester United shirt to wear. 2014 has not been the best year for  Murray, as he failed to build on his previous successes and add to his US Open and Wimbledon titles in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Murray was training earlier this month in Miami ahead of the Australian Open in January . Murray collapses to the ground after a gruelling training session... his trainer sees the funny side . He also dropped to a year-end ranking of No 6 in the world, and fell at the quarter-final hurdle of three of the four Grand Slams - only making the last-four of the French Open before losing in straight sets to Rafael Nadal.

Geelong forward Brad Hartman, 20, was driving home on Sunday afternoon when he clipped the vehicle in St Peter's in South Australia but kept driving, according to a statement from the club. On Monday, he reported the incident to police after discussing the matter with his father. Brad Hartman played his first game for the Cats on June 15 this year . Getting amongst it: Hartman handballs during a Round 13 game against the St Kilda Saints last year . He has been charged with leaving the scene of an accident and failing to stop at a stop sign.

"It seems everything in the technological world was bigger and better in 2014. From ballooning smartphones to a tidal wave of Uber, it was the year to reap the benefits of an increasingly digitised age. But with virtual reality beginning to make a splash and on-demand streaming just around the corner, what can we expect in 2015? PHONES GET BIGGER . After Samsung paved the way with the 2011 Galaxy Note, competitors have followed suit with larger modelled smart phones . Initially dismissed as a fad, large-screened mobile phones are becoming the norm. Analysts thought Samsung had lost its marbles when it popped a 5.3-inch display on its 2011 Galaxy Note. This year's phones make that model look puny. Apple joined the phablet party with its 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, while Google and Nokia went one better with 6-inch offerings. The extra screen space is better for games, videos, and heavy web-browsing. Analysts predict the trend will continue. UBER DRIVES ON . Despite an increasingly controversial reputation, Uber continues to propser around the world . The car-hailing company accelerated its rollout, irking taxi operators and posing tough questions for regulators worldwide. Its app-based services reached Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Geelong and the Gold Coast this year after launching in Sydney and Melbourne in 2013. It's met opposition from regulators concerned about the safety of its ridesharing service, Uber X, which lets users book lifts in everyday cars. Uber ploughs on regardless and remains confident regulators will see the light. BITCOIN AT A CROSSROADS . Despite the emergence of bitcoin ATMs and debit cards, the value of Bitcoin has not recovered from a suspected cyber-hack in February . The pre-eminent cryptocurrency was dealt a severe blow in February when the biggest exchange, Tokyo-based Mt Gox, collapsed after a suspected cyber attack. Bitcoin's value plummeted and hasn't recovered. It's now trading at about half its January high of about $US800 ($A865.57). Analysts remain concerned about security and the lack of regulation, but Australian entrepreneurs are keeping the faith. To try to take it mainstream, one company began rolling out bitcoin ATMs and another has launched a bitcoin debit card. FACEBOOK WINS FRIENDS . This year saw Facebook bolster its position of utter dominance, reaching 1.35 billion monthly users . The world's premier social network bolstered its position of utter dominance. It has 1.35 billion monthly users at latest count, 64 per cent of whom use it daily. Third-quarter revenue grew 59 per cent from the same period in 2013 to reach $US3.2 billion ($A3.46 billion). Most of those dollars come from advertising to the mobile users marketers so dearly want to reach. CEO Mark Zuckerberg spooked investors with some wacky thoughts on future investments, but the business ends the year in excellent shape. GLASS HALF EMPTY . Google glasses became a byword for intrusion, with the public uneasy that wearers could be covertly filming everything they see . This was meant to be the year Google took Glass, its pioneering head-mounted computer, mainstream. Instead, the company has gone quiet. The gadget has become a byword for intrusion, with the public uneasy that wearers could be covertly filming everything they see. Google has yet to put it on general sale, focusing instead on mobiles and smartwatches. App developers have likewise lost interest. Other companies such as Epson and Huawei are working on their own takes. If they can find a market for them, perhaps Google will revisit the technology. - WHAT 2015 HOLDS - . WATCH THE WATCHES . Despite failing to crack the mainstream, the technology and software of smartwatches are rapidly improving . Smartwatches have been around for a while now. Samsung, LG, Sony and, most recently, Motorola, have all had a crack at the gadgets. But, bulky and geeky-looking, none has cracked the mainstream. That could change in 2015. The technology and software is improving and - crucially - they're beginning to look half decent. Apple's first attempt, revealed to much fanfare in September, is set to hit the market early in the year. The world's premier tech company has a knack for timing and rarely misreads the market, though it might take a couple of tweaks to get it right. FROM A STREAM TO A FLOOD . After years of anticipation, Netflix confirmed in November  it will launch in Australia in March . Broadcast bosses can ignore it no longer: the future of TV is online, and 2015 is shaping as the tipping point. Netflix confirmed as much in November when it announced that it will launch in Australia in March. Foxtel has already slashed subscription prices in anticipation. Channel Nine and Fairfax Media have announced their own service, called Stan, while Channel Seven is expected to reveal its plans soon. These are in addition to local streaming services such as QuickFlix and EzyFlix. It's scary for the incumbents, but good news for Australians crying out for more choice. VIRTUAL TO BECOME REALITY . Samsung and Google this year released impressive headsets that use smartphones for a virtual reality screen . Twenty years since its potential was first discussed, virtual reality is poised to hit the mainstream. Breakthroughs in 3D graphics and sensor technology have brought prices down to a palatable point for everyday consumers. Samsung and Google this year released impressive headsets that use smartphones for a screen. Next year, we can expect Sony's Project Morpheus, which will tie in with the PlayStation 4, and the pioneering Facebook-owned Oculus Rift. It raises new possibilities for immersive gaming and entertainment, but, like most new technologies, success will hinge on the appetite of app and game developers. PAYMENTS GO MOBILE . In 2015, users will be able to store credit card information on new iPhones and tap-and-pay at registers . Tech companies haven't enjoyed much success in trying to nudge their way into in-store payments. That could begin to change in 2015 with the rollout of Apple Pay. Users will be able to store credit card information on new iPhones and tap-and-pay at registers, using the fingerprint scanner for verification. Early reviews from the US have praised the system's ease of use. Deloitte research suggests only about a third of Australians are prepared to use their phone as a payment device, but analysts suggest this percentage will grow. Trust is the biggest issue. The entry of a company of Apple's prestige could be a game changer. TABLET WITHDRAWAL . It's believed that Tablet sales, which slowed to 7.2 per cent this year, will continue to dwindle in the coming year . Tablet growth slowed to 7.2 per cent this year - a dramatic fall from the 52.5 per cent of 2013, according to market-tracker IDC. There is little sign things will pick up in 2015. Tablets are being squeezed as phones get bigger. People also tend to hold onto them for a year or two longer than they do smartphones. iPad sales are predicted to flatline, with Windows and Android tablets faring slightly better. Apple left its iPad Mini practically unchanged this year, suggesting it could soon be shelved. Forrester researchers expect Apple to launch an iPad about the 13-inch mark to compete with hybrid laptop-tablets such as Microsoft's Surface Pro 3.","Leading smartphone companies have increased the size of their models .

"In a significant boost to Chancellor George Osborne, forecasters have claimed the British economy will be larger than Germany's by 2030 . The British economy will be larger than Germany’s by 2030, forecasters have claimed. In a significant boost to Chancellor George Osborne, analysis also suggests that the UK overtook France in 2014 to become the world’s fifth largest economy. The promising forecast will be an embarrassment to Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is still haunted by his praise for French president Francois Hollande, now leading a faltering economy with record levels of unemployment. And the analysis also claims that within the next two decades, Germany, held back by a declining population and the weakness of the euro, could be overtaken by the UK for the first time since 1954. The projections, in the World Economic League Table by the influential City think-tank the Centre for Economic and Business Research, will make encouraging reading for Mr Osborne. They demonstrate that even though the most recent data shows growth was not quite as robust as at first thought in 2014, the UK’s total output overtook France’s. The growth in Britain’s national accounts was aided by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to include earnings from the previously uncharted economy of drugs and the sex trade. The French figures do not yet include these industries. CEBR’s league table tracks the size of different economies around the globe and projects changes over the next decade. In 2013, the US and China were the largest economies, with Japan and Germany next. France came in fifth, while the UK was just behind. One of the most startling findings from the latest analysis is the gradual erosion of Germany’s position as Europe’s locomotive nation. ‘Germany slides back, held back by a declining population and the likely weakness of the euro. In 2030 Germany, which was the world’s third largest economy, is overtaken by the UK for the first time since 1954 to drop to seventh place in the league,’ notes CEBR’s chief executive Douglas McWilliams. The changing shape of Europe’s pecking order demonstrates how wise it was for Britain to stay out of the eurozone following the wide-ranging study by then Chancellor Gordon Brown (left) in 2003 when he was under pressure from pro-European forces led by Tony Blair (right( . The changing shape of Europe’s pecking order demonstrates how wise it was for Britain to stay out of the eurozone following the wide-ranging study by then Chancellor Gordon Brown in 2003 when he was under pressure from pro-European forces led by Tony Blair. Russia, which has been under enormous pressure from Western sanctions over Ukraine, the falling oil price and the tumbling rouble, looks set to remain a second-rate economic power. It has now slipped from eighth to tenth place in the global league and it will remain there in 2030 despite the country’s enormous wealth of natural resources. The CEBR’s World Economic League Table also finds that emerging economies are set to grow even more quickly than expected. China is set to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in 2025 – three years earlier than previously thought. Pictured is US president Barack Obama with Chinese President Xi Jinping last month . India’s ‘unstoppable rise’ will continue, overtaking the UK to become the largest economy in the Commonwealth in 2018. And China is set to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in 2025 – three years earlier than previously thought. Mr McWilliams added: ‘The league table brings things back to hard figures. Countries who have invaded neighbouring countries and whose leaders spout aggressively nationalistic rhetoric are brought down to earth by their falls in the league table as their economies collapse. ‘It also shows the dramatic changes now taking place in the world’s economic geography, with slow-growing European economies falling back and Asian economies catching up.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The news from the Centre for Economic and Business Research that the UK is moving up the world economic league table shows that the British people’s hard work this year is paying off and that the economic plan is working. ‘But the Government is the first to say the job is not done, so we need to carry on working through our economic plan that is securing a resilient economy and a better future.’","Analysis suggests UK became the world's fifth largest economy in 2014 .

"They may be able to stand the heat on the pitch, but young  stars Luke Shaw and Adnan Januzaj will no longer have to stay out of the kitchen - with Manchester United arranging for a top chef  to teach them how to cook. According to The Sun, the club sends a chef to their homes to give them advice on diet and food preparation. And they could easily have taken advantage of their new-found skills on Christmas Day, after Manchester United players were given the day off by Louis van Gaal ahead of the visit of Newcastle on Boxing Day. Luke Shaw and Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal in discussion during a training session . The 19-year-old left back is being taught how to cook by a chef organised by Manchester United . 'Some of our players - including first team regulars like Luke Shaw and Adnan Januzaj - are in their teens and some haven't learned how to cook,' a source told The Sun. 'So we send a chef to give their fridges the once-over. The chef explains what needs throwing out, what's healthy and what's not. Then they re-stock the fridge and work on some healthy recipes. 'Most have £30,000 designer kitchens which wouldn't be out of place in Michelin-starred restaurants but some can barely use a microwave let alone an oven.' Shaw's Manchester United career has been blighted by injury thus far, as he has managed just seven Premier League games since joining the club for £30million during the summer. His most recent start came during the club's 2-1 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates stadium last month, although he managed just 16 minutes of that game before being forced off through injury. And he is set to miss out again when Newcastle visit Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Adnan Januzaj is another youngster being given advice on diet and food preparation . The Belgian youngster in discussion with senior team-mates Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie . Manchester United youngster Shaw took to Twitter to celebrate Christmas Day with his family . Januzaj, meanwhile, has struggled to make an impact so far this campaign after such an impressive debut season under David Moyes. The youngster is out of favour with Van Gaal, and could be set to leave the club on loan in January, with French champions Paris Saint-Germain among those interested to take him on loan. His last appearance for United was on December 2 against Stoke City at Old Trafford, and with the club not in Europe this season, Januzaj would be eligible to play in the Champions League, while Premier League clubs such as Everton and Hull are also keen.","Luke Shaw and Adnan Januzaj among those taught to cook by a chef .

"Manchester City's slow start to the Barclays Premier League season was due to poor preparation, according to full back Pablo Zabaleta. The Argentinian full back, who has once again been a crucial part of City's defence this season, blamed the champions' disappointing early-season form on a lack of fitness in the club's squad. But Zabaleta insisted that City, who are on an eight-game winning run in the league, are now back to their best as they hunt down Chelsea. Pablo Zabaleta celebrates with David Silva after helping Manchester City extend their winning run . Zabaleta claims his team-mates were under-prepared at the start of the season, but are now ready to shine . 'From the beginning of the season some of the players were not physically 100 per cent,' said Zabaleta. 'But now we look so much better. 'It was hard becasue we probably didn't have enough rest and it wasn't a very long pre-season,' added the Argentine, who played in last summer's World Cup final. 'Now I think everyone has improved. That's why we have got better as a team - and we have to keep playing at this level. 'In the way we want to play, we were lacking some intensity and concentration. It cost us a few points.' Zabaleta hailed Manchester City's team spirit after making it eight wins in a row against Crystal Palace . Silva (right) opened the scoring with a deflected shot during Manchester City's 3-0 defeat of Crystal Palace . However, going into the busy Christmas period City, who were once nine points behind leaders Chelsea, are now just three points off top spot. City travel to West Brom on Boxing Day hoping to keep the pressure up on the Premier League's top side. And Zabeleta believes Jose Mourinho's team are bound to drop points during the festive fixtures. The likes of Yaya Toure made slow starts to the City title defence, but have started to show their best form . 'Even if Chelsea are winning games and looking solid, it is normal to have a point of the season where you can lose points. 'It will be very hard to play on the 26th and 28th within 48 hours of one another.'","Manchester City had a slow start to the Premier League season .

"Lanzarote, Tenerife and Cancun in Mexico are offering British holidaymakers some of the best bargains for a post-holiday break thanks to a stronger pound, research has revealed. The pound is making top winter sun destinations more affordable for UK tourists with those visiting resorts such as Tenerife, Lanzarote and Paphos in Cyprus now getting five per cent more for their money than a year ago. Some of the best savings are found in long-haul destinations, where the local currency has dipped even more against the sterling. For a seven-night package holiday, Lanzarote offers the best-value for money, according to a study . Holidaymakers who are heading to destinations in the US will get 4.3 per cent less for their money . Britons jetting off to sunny Cancun will get 8.2 per cent more for their money than last year, while visitors to Tokyo will see their money stretch 9.1 per cent further. For a seven-night package holiday, including evening meals, Lanzarote offers the best-value for money with such a package costing just £278 per person. The next-best resort is Paphos (£283), followed by Tenerife (£309) and Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt where the package costs £408 despite a 1.2 per cent dip in the pound's value in Egypt since last year. Britons jetting off to sunny Cancun will get 8.2 per cent more for their money than last year . Visitors to Tokyo will see their money stretch 9.1 per cent further than it did last year, research has revealed . Holidaymakers who are heading to the US will get 4.3 per cent less for their money, as the pound has dipped against the US dollar in the last year. Caribbean destinations are more affordable than a year ago, while the pound is 4.8 per cent stronger against the South African rand. Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: ‘Although European winter sun holidays are unbeatable on price, the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh is also great value with packages pegged at 2013 levels to make them a compelling proposition for bargain hunters. ‘Further afield, the continuing strength of sterling against currencies for some of the most popular long haul beach destinations will make these attractive to wallet watchers as well -particularly in Mexico and Jamaica where the pound has risen in value recently.’","UK holidaymakers are finding solid bargains thanks to a stronger pound .

Scroll down for video . Get the look: Daisy Lowe, the model face of Rodial's first make-up range, shared her  beauty and style tips with FEMAIL . As the face of the capsule range, which is designed to sculpt and define the cheeks and features for a natural, flawless and radiant look, Daisy obviously loves using the products. 'It's a fail-safe range,' says Daisy. 'You just have to learn where to place the contouring. My top tip is: suck in your cheeks and make a fish face, which casts a natural shadow on your face. 'Then apply the bronzer over that shadow and then pop the highlighter above that.' Sharing her signature Christmas beauty look, she said: 'My Christmas Party essentials for luminous skin are the Contour Powder to add definition and Illuminating Powder for a glow because, for me, Christmas  is all about gleaming skin. 'For party eyes, my go-to favourites are Eye Sculpt and Smokey Eye Pen in black, which I smudge for a smoky eye effect finished with lashings of Skinny Mascara.' Inspired: The model says she takes beauty and style inspiration from Erin O’ Connor and  Mariah Carey . After years on the modelling circuit, Daisy says the top tip she's picked up is using concealer around her nose to even the skin tone. 'And make your forehead and chin a lighter shade than the rest of your face for a more defined look,' she said. The dewy-skinned model says she swears by lymphatic drainage and blue light treatments to keep her skin clear and has a Michael Kors bag, a set of travel speakers and Tom Ford fragrance on her Christmas wish list. The model - who is the daughter of Pearl Lowe and Gavin Rossdale - says she takes beauty inspiration from supermodel Erin O’ Connor and style cues from Mariah Carey. Sculpt: The new make-up is a capsule range created to help define cheekbones, eyes and make skin glow . Daisy, who describes her personal style as 'Parisian chic with a naughty London twist', says she loves toughening up a grown-up dress with grungy Dr. Martens to 'stay true to her Camden roots'. Inspired by the Thirties and Seventies, she loves creations by Christopher Kane, Erdem and Saint Laurent and says online shopping at Topshop and Reformation is 'lethal'. No wonder Daisy has such good taste- she has best pal and fashion's darling Alexa Chung to share style secrets with. While Alexa, who is known for her famous feline eye flick and recently unveiled her own eye make-up range,  is 'amazing' at doing make-up, said Daisy. Rodial founder Maria Hatzistefanis, left, handpicked Daisy to be the face of their brand's first make-up range . Fashion models Suki Waterhouse, Daisy Lowe, Clara Paget and Cara Delevingne attend US Ambassador Matthew Barzun and Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman's celebration of London Fashion Week in September . Daisy may have just been signed up by Rodial, but she's also been very busy with other projects. Recently, the in-demand brunette was unveiled as the new face of U.S. clothing brand American Eagle Outfitters. And, as well as her modelling duties, earlier this year the baking enthusiast released a recipe book entitled Sweetness And Light, a collection of recipes for 60 healthy treats. By making simple changes to ingredients, such as using maple syrup rather than refined sugar, or discovering new ingredients like raw chocolate, Daisy promises that her recipes are transformed into something 'devilishly delicious' but 'angelically healthy'. Fashion family: The model, with mum Pearl Lowe, cites Katharine Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot as style icons . Best friends: Daisy, pictured, left, with Alexa Chung and, right, with Nick Grimshaw, wants to travel the world . 'I just love cooking,' she told us. 'In the future I want to do more cooking, shooting campaigns and see the world. 'In five years time I want to continue doing loads of fashion stuff and be happy with a big smile on my face.' Speaking about her festive food habits, she said: 'I let myself off a little bit at Christmas, eating is the main event of the day after all and my New Year's resolution is live in the moment.' With such a positive attitude to life, it's no wonder the founder of Rodial, Maria Hatzistefanis, snapped her up. She said: ‘I first met Daisy when she attended our Rodial awards where she won Woman of the Year. I was impressed by her effortless natural beauty, style and radiance. 'What Daisy can bring to the Rodial brand is a modern, cool and quintessentially British edge.’ From the £52-illuminating powder to the eye sculpt,£34, each of the new products have been designed to contour and sculpt your face. The powders are opalescent, so designed to highlight facial features with an illuminating gleam, and the universal champagne tone aims to add a candle-lit glow to the skin. The powders use micronisation technology  in the formula, which is intended to give the skin a silky texture and ensures even application. The eye products have been made with a mousse-like texture, which, say the makers, can be built up from subtle natural enhancement to a deeper, more sculpted effect so  looks can go from day to night. There's also a tinted cream, £24, that adds a flush of colour to the cheeks to give a long-wearing healthy glow. The moisture-boosting hyaluronic acid promises to plump skin while the coral shade adds a subtle rosy colour to the apple of the cheeks. If you want to try before you buy, Harvey Nichols has opened a sculpting bar, where beauty fans can test out the products.

"Ice hockey is thought to be a rough and violent sport, but this heart-warming moment involving two Canadian youngsters shows an inspiring display of sportsmanship. Proud father Mike Zegil captured the moment while his youngest daughter, four-year-old Amara, was on the ice with the Gore Bay tyke hockey team in their home arena at Manitoulin Island, Ontario. Amara was there to lend a helping hand after a pint-sized opponent fell to the ice and was unable to get back on her skates. Amara (right) extends a hand to help her opponent, Arabella, get back on her ice skates . Mike Zegil captured the moment while his  daughter was playing with the Gore Bay tyke hockey team . The adorable moment unfolded while Amara’s team went on the attack against the visitors from Manitowaning. As the players in white jerseys skate up the ice, one of their opponents – three-year-old Arabella – falls at the blue line and is unable to get back up on her own. That's when Amara skates over to Arabella and extends her glove to help her rival to her feet. The two – both wearing No 12 – then skate side-by-side as they chase the puck with their teammates.

"A customer who altered a credit card contract without the provider noticing is now suing the bank - for breaching his own terms and conditions. Russian Dmitry Argarkov, 42, wasn't happy with the credit card terms being offered by Tinkoff Credit Systems so he scanned the document into his computer and made a few changes. His more favourable terms included unlimited credit, zero per cent interest and no bank fees or fines. He also added a clause that he could fine the bank three million ruples - around £588 - every time the company failed to comply with the rules and a further six million ruples - £117 - if they tried to terminate the contract. Mr Argarkov, from Voronezh, Russia, then sent the amended contract back to Tinkoff which didn't pick up on the alterations and returned him the signed paperwork along with a credit card. Getting a better offer: Dmitry Argarkov, 42, decided to rewrite the terms of a credit card contract and is now suing Tinkoff Credit Systems for breaching his terms and conditions . After two years of using the account, the Russian company terminated Mr Argarkov's credit card in 2010 because he was late on his minimum payments, Russia Today reported. The company then took him to court to try and reclaim 45,000 rubles - around £881 - in unpaid fees and charges. But as Mr Argarkov's contract with Tinkoff stated he did not have to pay the bank any fines or account fees, a Russian court ruled this week that he only needed to repay the outstanding balance on the card - just 19,000 (approximately £371). The judge ruled: 'They signed the . documents without looking. They said what usually their borrowers say in . court: ""We have not read it"".' All in the small print: Mr Argarkov changed the contract terms to give himself 0% interest, unlimited credit and exemption from fines and bank fees. He is now suing Tinkoff for not honouring the contract they signed after failing to read his altered small print . And after his victory in court, Mr . Argarkov is suing the bank for 24million rubles - approximately £470,000 . - for not honouring the amended contract they signed. His lawyer Dmitry Mikhalevich told Kommersant: 'The Bank confirmed its agreement to the client's terms and sent him a credit card and a copy of the approved application form. 'The opened credit line was unlimited. He could afford to buy an island somewhere in Malaysia, and the bank would have to pay for it by law.' Tinkoff has launched a counter claim against Mr Argarkov, accusing him of fraud. Oleg Tinkov, founder of the bank, tweeted: 'Our lawyers think he is going to get not 24m, but really 4 years in prison for fraud. Now it's a matter of principle for @tcsbanktwitter.' The court will review Mr Argakov's case next month.

"To those who live in the tiny village of Sandringham in Norfolk, Christmas brings more than just a visit from St. Nick. With the Queen in residence just over a mile away, it also brings a motley collection of press and well-wishers – as well as the royal family itself. Luckily for the villagers, they’ve had nearly two centuries to get used to it – and as these striking images reveal, very little has changed. A new collection of images from the Royal Collection Trust reveal the festive traditions that the royal family Christmas entails. Pictured- the dining room at Windsor castle . The pictures, which have been taken from the Royal Archives, reveal festive celebrations that manage to be both familiar while being grander than most of us will ever experience. And if the modern royal family prefers to dial down the grandeur in favour of family celebrations and amusing joke presents, it certainly wasn’t always so. Queen Victoria, whose husband Prince Albert introduced the festive fir to the UK in 1841, was partial to a sizeable tree as Ernst Becker’s 1857 lithograph reveals. Heavily laden with candles and surrounded by family pictures, it’s every inch a tree fit for a Queen or, indeed, an Empress as Victoria by then was. According to the Royal Collection Trust there are approximately 10 Christmas trees at Windosr castle this year, locations include St George's Hall, the Crimson Drawing Room, and in the China Corridor . But while the current Queen is no stranger to an impressive pine, her 20ft specimen takes pride of place at Sandringham, while Queen Victoria, in the early days of her reign at least, preferred to celebrate at Windsor. Not that Windsor Castle is a tree-free zone, as Royal Collection Trust curator Sally Goodsir explains. ‘There are approximately 10 trees along the visitor route this year,’ she reveals. ‘Locations include St George's Hall, the Crimson Drawing Room, in the China Corridor and in the Waterloo Chamber.’ Planning the festive décor takes approximately six months while putting everything up takes three days, with much of the work done at night. Queen Victoria's Christmas Tree - William Corden the Younger (1819-1900) Prince Albert driving the Queen and Princess Royal in their Sledge, at Brighton. JWG (lithographer), c.1840s . The toughest job of all though, involves the 60ft spruce that dominates St George’s Hall come December. ‘It requires 2500 twinkling lights,’ adds Goodsir. ‘Between 500 and 600 decorations are placed on it, and long ladders are required to reach the top.’ But the vast spruce isn’t the only striking addition made to Windsor Castle’s already impressive collection of artefacts. Another, the Christmas table laid out in the State Dining Room, gives a flavour of how the big day would have been celebrated while Queen Victoria was still alive. 'The special table display in the State Dining Room at Windsor Castle evokes a sense of how the royal family celebrated Christmases past,’ explains Goodsir, who masterminded the set-up. ‘Set with the magnificent silver-gilt Grand Service commissioned by George IV, it also includes a centrepiece which Prince Albert designed, which features four of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's favourite pet dogs.' The Queen's Christmas Tree, Windsor Castle, 1845. Joseph Nash (1809-1878) Christmas trees of the Duchess of Kent and the royal children at Windsor Castle, 1850 James Roberts (c. 1800-67) Considerably grander, in short, than today’s incarnation. But then, Windsor Castle, with its 1,000 rooms and a history that began with William the Conqueror, is itself considerably grander than the ‘homely’ Sandringham. That came into the royal family in 1862 and is only one of two palaces – the other being Balmoral – personally owned by the Queen herself. Originally intended to be the marital home of the then Edward, Prince of Wales and his Danish wife, Princess Alexandra, it swiftly became a much-loved family residence. The current house on the site is also new in comparison to Windsor. While that began life as a motte and bailey castle built by William the Conqueror, Sandringham was designed by Norfolk architect AJ Humbert and completed in 1870. A ballroom was added in 1881 and a guest wing in the early 1890s, although that wasn’t enough for its owner who, right up until the moment he died in 1910, ‘was continually improving his domain, repairing churches, spending money on the place in one way or another,’ according to a letter written by a friend. With Edward VII gone, ownership of the house passed to George V who described it as ‘the place I love better than anywhere in the world’ and began the tradition of spending Christmas there. It was also George who began another royal Christmas tradition – the monarch’s annual speech to the nation. The first Christmas message was broadcast to what was then the British Empire was in 1932, with George calling for nations to work towards peace from Sandringham’s ‘business room’. It was a tradition enthusiastically embraced by his successor George VI who became king shortly after his brother Edward VIII abdicated weeks before Christmas 1936. The Queen's Christmas Tree, Windsor Castle, 24 Dec 1857 Ernst Becker (1826-88) Edward had been on the throne for less than eight months before standing aside in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Like his father George V, who had been at Sandringham when he died on the 20th January 1936, George VI, who was both born and died at the house, was devoted to his Norfolk home. Indeed, so happy was he at Sandringham, he fondly wrote of it: ‘I have always been happy here and I love the place.’ Under George VI, Christmas at the house became more of a family affair, with his children, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, enjoying a succession of happy Christmases at the house – all of which bear more than a little resemblance to the modern incarnation. Then, as now, guests begin arriving on the 23rd although most descend on Christmas Eve itself. The tree, a 20ft spruce taken from the 20,000-acre Sandringham Estate, is decorated by the younger members of the family – supervised by the Queen. After tea, the presents are unwrapped – a nod to the Queen Alexandra, who introduced the Danish tradition after her marriage to the future Edward VII in 1863. Osborne House, The Dining Room at Christmas c. 1873 . A formal black-tie dinner follows, with festivities ending at around 10pm when the women withdraw for coffee while the men stay on to enjoy a glass of port. Christmas morning brings a trip to the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Sandringham village where the royals greet well-wishers and villagers before continuing on into church. The Queen, who remains devout, goes every day during the Christmas period, although, as last year showed, doesn’t always stop to chat. Afterwards comes lunch, served at 1pm on the dot, with traditional festive fare, including a turkey raised on the Sandringham Estate, on the menu. The Queen then withdraws to watch her Christmas message alone, while the rest of the family gather around the TV to watch. This year's had the theme of reconciliation and included a cameo role for Game of Thrones and Sinn Fein politician Martin McGuinness. Both featured in the Queen's historic visit to Belfast in June, which also included the monarch's first selfie, courtesy of 14-year-old schoolboy, Jack Surgenor. On Boxing Day comes another royal tradition - Prince Philip's annual shoot - which will see members of the family, usually including the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, brave the cold for the chance to bag a pheasant or two. For Norway’s Crown Prince Haakon and his wife Mette-Marit, Christmas is all about enjoying the snow. By contrast, Monaco’s Prince Albert and Princess Charlene spend the big day making the most of the Mediterranean sunshine, although with the princess still in hospital following the birth of twin babies, this year’s celebrations look set to be a little more muted. But what about the rest? Nikki Jeffries, royal expert and managing editor at Royalista.com, reveals what the crowned heads of Europe did on December 25th. ‘Finally Christmas is here again and the royals in Europe are celebrating the festive season in many ways. ‘Some, including King Felipe and Queen Letizia, will be ""at work"", while others are taking well-deserved holidays or spreading Christmas cheer wherever they can. ‘In Denmark 41 royals, among them Queen Margrethe and her heir Crown Prince Frederik, will be gathered around the Christmas tree for what is one of the largest royal family Christmases in Europe. ‘Like the Queen, Margrethe also sends a Christmas message to her people, although Denmark’s speech is made on New Year’s Day instead. ‘In Monaco, this year will be all about the twins, although swimming and giving gifts are likely to play a part in keeping with Monegasque tradition. ‘The Norwegian royals will enjoy the most low-key celebrations, much of which will revolve around gingerbread which is an essential way to spread Christmas cheer. ‘Regardless of which country is involved, the one thing that they all do have in common is that Christmas is private and all about family.’","A series of photographs revealed by Royal Collection Trust showcase the royal family's Christmas traditions .

"She has one of the most famous wardrobes in the world and nearly everything she wears sells out - so it's no surprise that the Duchess of Cambridge has been crowned 2014's most stylish woman. The future Queen, 32, beat Victoria Beckham, 40, into second place and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, 31, into third, in a new poll of 2,000 Britons. Runners up included actresses Emma Watson, 24, and Jessica Alba, 33, and Ultimo model Abbey Clancy, 28. Style queen: The Duchess of Cambridge has been named the most stylish woman of 2014 . Striking: Yesterday saw the Duchess arrive at Sandringham church in a chic herringbone tweet coat .

Another fashion flop was Kim Kardashian who, despite her much-vaunted makeover and American Vogue cover, was just behind Ms Price in the poll. But it was the Duchess of Cambridge who amassed the most plaudits, thanks to her pitch-perfect ensembles. Highlights from this year include the stunning white Zimmerman dress worn during April's visit to Sydney and the dramatic Diane von Furstenburg number worn for the Royal Variety Performance. Also popular was the recycled Jenny Packham teal gown worn for a gala dinner in New York earlier this month and the pink Mulberry coat worn for a visit to the 9/11 memorial during the same trip.

'It's encouraging to see women of all ages, shapes and sizes dominating the poll,' added the spokeswoman.

Spain has been battling to emerge from its second recession in just over three years with its economy still reeling from the collapse of the once-booming real estate sector. The Spanish economy first fell into recession in the second half of 2008, with millions of jobs were lost and tough austerity measures put in place. Spain then sank into its second recession since 2009 at the end of 2011 after a burst housing bubble left millions of low-skilled laborers out of work and sliding private and business sentiment gutted consumer spending and imports. Fueled malaise: Efforts by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to control Spain's deficits through billions of euros of spending cuts and tax hikes . Efforts by Prime Minister Mariano . Rajoy's government to control one of the eurozone's largest deficits . through billions of euros of spending cuts and tax hikes have fueled . general malaise, further hampering demand. When Rajoy took office in late 2011 there were 5.27 million jobless in Spain. Battling to reduce a swollen deficit and avoid a bailout, the year-old conservative government has brought major financial and labor reforms and applied severe cutbacks in wages and spending but so far the economy has shown few signs of recovery. The austerity measures are aimed at lowering the deficit, but are hurting the economy in the short-term, while the reforms will only help growth in the longer-term. That means the economy will suffer more before it recovers. The European economy has also been rocked by a downturn in factory output as hopes of recovery were dealt another damaging setback last Saturday. Gloomy figures showed British manufacturers suffered a decline in activity last month – the first since November – while factory output in the eurozone fell for a 19th month in a row in February as a dire performance in France offset a return to growth in Germany. It came as a separate report showed unemployment hit a record high of 11.9 per cent in the single currency bloc in January. The slump in manufacturing and rise in unemployment to 19m – up 1.9m on January 2012 – rounded off a dismal week for the eurozone as the political deadlock in Italy threatened to plunge the region deeper into crisis. Crisis: A man waits outside a Madrid employment office as the latest figures revealed that 26 per cent of the population were unemployed at the end of the fourth quarter, the highest level since 1975 . ‘The overall picture is consistent . with a eurozone economy that is still stuck in recession,’ said Lee . Hardman, currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Research . group Markit said its index of activity in UK manufacturing – where 50 . is the cut off between growth and decline – sank from 50.5 in January to . 47.9 in February. It left Britain on the brink of a third recession in . five years after the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter . of 2012. Chris Williamson, . chief economist at Markit, said: ‘This represents a major setback to . hopes that the UK economy can return to growth in the first quarter and . avoid a triple-dip recession.’ The eurozone manufacturing index also read 47.9. Germany scored 50.3 but Spain hit 46.8, Italy 45.8 and France 43.9.

"Opening a door, driving a car, even yawning - they are all daily activities we take for granted. But for one mother-of-five, any one of of those simple tasks means the risk of a very painful dislocation. Jojo Meadows suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) -  a rare  condition which causes her bones to dislocate up to  ten times a day. Scroll down for video . Jojo Meadows (pictured) suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) - a rare condition which causes her bones to dislocate up to ten times a day . The agonising condition has seen the 38-year-old to break or dislocate almost every bone in her body. Even simple tasks are enough to force her bones to pop out of their sockets. But despite her bizarre illness, Jojo, from Hereford,  is determined not to the condition hold her back. Jojo said: 'My bones pop out so often, that sometimes I don't even notice it. 'The worst one was when I dislocated my jaw so I could barely speak. My four-year-old son was shouting down the phone to 999 telling them that my mouth had fallen out. 'My kids were doing handstands and I decided to join in - before I even thought about what I was doing I broke both my wrists. 'I dislocate my bones daily so it's become a normality, but it's still very painful. 'I'd say I end up in the hospital around 100 times a year.' The condition is a genetic one which means the collagen in Jojo's body is too weak to hold her limbs in place. Her condition means the 38-year-old has broken or dislocated almost every bone in her body (right) She first noticed the condition when she was just 12 years old after finding bruises on her skin. Jojo said: 'I noticed the symptoms when I was still at school, but I didn't get a diagnosis for 24 years. 'Doctors were stumped until I had a hysterectomy in 2009, and a doctor referred me to a joints specialist. 'When they told me I had EDS I was relieved, finally I had an answer to why my body is the way it is. 'I'd never heard of the condition before but quickly researched it and found out about the condition very quickly, I now help doctors to understand the early signs of EDS. 'Since I was diagnosed I've had to be more careful, but equally I don't let anything get in my way. 'It could easily let the condition disable me and change my temperament but I'm not going to let it, I've got a life to live, beautiful children and a lot to be thankful for.

Internal hemorrhaging . - Bleeds of the spleen . - Kidneys . - Ovaries . Womb . Bbowel . Lung . Bladder . Now, Jojo continues to live with her condition, and takes each day as it comes. She said: 'EDS affects my everyday life. 'Just last week I had to make three visits to the hospital, and I need extra help every day. 'I've visited the doctors so many times now that I'm a regular - they recognise me instantly.' Despite Jojo's frail bones, she has been an avid skateboarder since her early teens - although she's no longer attempting adventurous tricks. She said: 'I can't do any jumps now because all my bones would probably pop out. 'If I banged my head it could be pretty dangerous for me so I only have a slow roll around now. 'I used to go on motorbikes, but I ended up dislocating my arms when someone accelerated, so skateboarding is the best I can get. 'For me skateboarding is a way of not letting EDS get the better of me, it's showing that the condition won't defeat me and it's very liberating.' She's now trying to raise awareness of the condition, which is infamously known for being difficult to diagnose. Along with Consultant Rheumatologist Dr Ayman Askari she travels around hospitals in the Midlands teaching doctors to spot the early signs of EDS. Dr. Askari said: 'It's a very rare condition so on the whole doctors don't think about it because it doesn't have any cure or medication to eradicate it. 'It's not like a sore throat that you can cure, it's a life-long condition that will forever be with you. He still believes there is a lot more that could be done, hoping to gain access to genetic testing facilities and teams of physiotherapists to help with hypermobility issues. Dr Askari added: 'The essential treatment for EDS comes through physiotherapy, additionally diagnosing the condition removes a lot of the anxiety patients suffer caused by worrying about their symptoms.' Jojo is also campaigning for more support to be available for people with EDS, especially during pregnancy after she was left bedridden, only awake for a few hours a day. She said: 'My 15 year old basically had to doing everything for me during my pregnancy. I couldn't walk. 'He had to feed me, carry me to the shower - it was horrendous. 'But now I want to move forward and look to help doctors provide support, I'm not here to criticise or condemn. 'I want to help however I can.'","Jojo Meadows, 38, suffers from the rare Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)

"One of Eric Garner's daughters has outraged New York police officers by sharing the address of another cop who was at the scene of her father's chokehold death this summer. At 1.45am on Thursday, Erica Garner tweeted  that cop Justin D'Amico, who has previously been named in reports, was 'another officer that helped killed my dad', the New York Post reported. She also shared a link that listed addresses for the officer and five possible relatives. Ms Garner, who has more than 5,000 followers on Twitter, promptly deleted the tweet after inquiries from the Post, it reported. Thoughtless: Erica Garner, whose father died at the hands of a police officer in July, tweeted the name of a second officer at the scene and shared addresses for him and five of his potential relatives . Her message came nearly a week after two police officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who had claimed he was going to put 'wings on pigs' for the deaths of Garner and Ferguson teenager Michael Brown. Police officers said they feared that D'Amico and his family could now be targeted because of the 'disgusting' tweet. 'She clearly wants someone to go to the officer's house and assassinate him in cold blood just like Ramos and Liu,' a police source told the Post. After the attack on Saturday, police reported threats of copycat attacks across the city. On Wednesday, Elvin Payamps of Queens was taken into custody after he allegedly told a friend that he wished the two cops had been white. Police allegedly found a cache of weapons at his home. Killed: Garner, pictured with his family, died after a police officer held him in a chokehold in July . Caught on camera: Garner, left, died after cops tried to arrest him for illegally selling untaxed cigarettes. The officer who held him in a chokehold, Daniel Pantaleo (right, center) was not indicted for the death . Anger: Erica Garner is pictured leading a march of protesters on December 11 in Staten Island . Ms Garner's family attorney did not deny that Erica Garner had shared the link to pastebin.com, which allows users to anonymously share text documents, but claimed she had not known what was in the link. 'Nobody in the Garner family, including Erica, would consciously send information out about the personal address or phone number or any identifying information about the police officers, particularly after what happened to those two officers,' Jonathan Moore said. D'Amico was given immunity to testify before the Staten Island grand jury that ultimately decided not to bring charges against another police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, who held Garner, 43, in a chokehold during his arrest on July 17. The NYPD banned the use of chokeholds in 1992. In the horrific incident, which was caught on camera by a passerby, Garner told the officers that he could not breathe, lost consciousness and later died. Loss: Her Twitter post came nearly a week after police officers Rafael Ramos, left, and Wenjian Liu, right, were shot dead in Brooklyn by a man claiming he was avenging the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown . Officers claimed he resisted arrest after he was caught illegally selling untaxed cigarettes. The grand jury's failure to indict Pantaleo sparked protests across the city, where demonstrations were already underway following another grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson officer who killed Brown in August. After Garner's death, Pantaleo was placed on modified leave and stripped of his gun and badge while D'Amico was assigned to desk duty.","Erica Garner tweeted addresses for Justin D'Amico and five of his possible relatives early on Thursday - but later removed the tweet .

"A generous attorney who overheard how a defendant could not afford restitution in his theft case has given the young father $983 so he avoids becoming a felon. Colin M. Murphy was sitting in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland, Oregon last Thursday as he waited for his case, when he heard lawyers and the judge discussing Castor Conley's predicament. Conley, a 27-year-old married father of a 17-month-old girl, paid $150 to $200 for a stolen Nissan truck last year and then sold it for $275 to another buyer, who in turn sold its parts, authorities said. The defendant, who had one other conviction for a fourth-degree assault in 2011, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, but the deputy district attorney agreed for it to be classified as a misdemeanor if he paid $983 to the owner of the truck, The Oregonian reported. Generous: Castor Conley, left with his wife, was ordered to pay $983 to the owner of a stolen truck in order to avoid a felony but could not pay up. An attorney, Colin M. Murphy, right, overheard and offered the money . Scene: Murphy had been waiting for his case to start in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland, Oregon last Thursday when he heard Conley's lawyer telling the court that his client could not afford the sum . The vehicle's owner, Shawn Stratton, also lost camping equipment that was inside the car, as well as hundreds of dollars to cover his insurance deductible. But Conley said he was unable to pay the money. Arrested: Conley admitted to buying a stolen truck for $150-$200 and then selling it for $275 last year . Failing to pay the sum meant that the plea deal would fall through and he would be convicted of a felony. Murphy, who has never met Conley before, said he knows how much a felony can affect employment and housing prospects. He said he felt the court simply wanted to compensate the truck's original owner while not overly penalizing the defendant. The deputy district attorney, Kevin Demer, said he did not want to punish Conley too harshly because he was the most minor player in a much larger scheme, and he had admitted to the crime. So Murphy stepped forward and offered the $983. Conley became emotional at the generous offer, his attorney, Lawrence Taylor, said. He shook the man's had and expressed his thanks. 'I've never experienced anything like this, not for even a smaller amount,'   Taylor told ABC News. 'This is unique and I've been practicing for 22 years.' Under the state's law, an attorney is not allowed to give or loan his client money, but Murphy does not represent Conley and mostly works in business law. Taylor, who had never seen Murphy before, said the attorney gave him a check that day. The judge told Conley that he should eventually pay Murphy back. Scheme: The truck was then taken to West Coast Car Crushing, pictured, and sold for its parts, but the deputy district attorney concluded that Conley had been a tiny part of a much larger operation . 'If I get paid back, great,' Murphy said. 'If I don't, no problem. I'm not going to hold the kid to it.' Murphy said he was happy to give the man a chance. 'All of us sometime in our lives have done something we would rather not have done,' he told The Oregonian. 'And the time will come when perhaps we are going to be held accountable. And I think at that point we would like to have somebody show us mercy.'","Castor Conley, 27, pleaded guilty to a felony for buying a stolen truck last year that he then sold to another man, who sold it for parts .

"A Florida woman arrested on drug charges died a week after being taken to a hospital to have a crack pipe removed from her genitals. April Rollison, 31, was arrested in Babson Park for drug possession December 16 along with three other people. During a body scan at the Polk County Jail, deputies spotted two items inside her body cavity. Sad end: April Rollison, 31, was pronounced dead in a Florida hospital a week after she had a crack pipe removed from her vagina following a drug arrest . Inmate: Rollison was arrested December 16 on drug possession charges and taken to Polk County Jail, where she later went into medical distress . Rollison was taken to Bartow Regional Medical Center to have the foreign objects removed from her body. While a nurse was getting a bedpan for her from behind a curtain, officials believe Rollison pulled out a prescription bottle wedged inside her vagina and ingested some of the crack rocks inside. The nurse then removed the glass crack pipe from Rollision's privates, after which she was returned to jail. As she was being booked, however, the 31-year-old went into medical distress and was rushed back to the hospital, reported The Ledger of Lakeland. Rollision remained hospitalized in critical condition for a week until she passed away just before 11am Monday. An autopsy will be performed on the inmate's body to determine a cause of death. Foreign objects: Detectives say the woman ingested crack rocks found inside a prescription pill bottle she had concealed inside her body cavity along with the crack pipe . According to the Ledger, the 31-year-old Louisiana native tested positive for methamphetamine, amphetamine, cocaine and marijuana. The State Attorney's Office will conduct an independent investigation into Rollison’s death while in custody. Family members told investigators Rollison had been using drugs since age 12 and they had not had any contact with her in two years, according to Bay News 9. Jail records show the 31-year-old woman had a long history of arrests on drug charges. Before her death, Rollison was charged with possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia and introduction of contraband into a detention facility.","April Rollison, 31, ingested crack rocks found inside pill bottle she had concealed inside her body along with crack pipe .

"An American veterinarian whose round the world trip of a lifetime was ruined in September when she was arrested in East Timor after sharing a cab with a stranger caught smuggling drugs has finally been released. Stacey Addison of Klamath Falls, Oregon was freed on Christmas day after spending four months in a women's prison. She is still however stuck in the country as the government will not return her passport. This as her mother, Bernadette Kero, begs people around the world to help and get her daughter back home, even starting a petition on Change.org. Finally free: After four months in prison, Stacey Addison (above) was finally released from an East Timor jail on Christmas . Stark conditions: She was incarcerated at Gleno Women's Prison where she shared a cell with several other prisoners, including a women who just gave birth to a baby, and cares for the child behind bars . False charge: She was jailed after sharing a cab with a man she did not know who was smuggling meth . CNN reports that nothing has been said by the government on when Addison might be able to return back to the United States, and when she might get her passport back. In the meantime, she is staying with former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta. And while she appreciates his hospitality, she is very clear that she will be going home the second she gets her passport back. 'I don't think my mom would ever forgive me if I didn't come home immediately and stay for a while,' she said. Addison planned the solo-trip to see wildlife around the world for nearly two years, and had visited Antarctica and parts of Europe before she landed in southeast Asia in early September. On September 5, Addison was sharing a cab with a complete stranger, en route to the capital city of Dili, when she first ran into trouble. 'The other passenger said he wanted to pick up a package at DHL and when he came out, the police swarmed it and she was terrified,' Kero said. That package contained meth, and everyone in the car was arrested. Addison spent the next four nights in jail, and when officials eventually released her, they took her passport leaving her unable to travel outside the country. 'Police searched me, they tested my urine. Everything was negative, so I thought its okay, it will be okay - but it's not,' Addison said. She remained positive since her computer records turned up clean and she had no criminal record. Mother and daughter: Addison with her mother Bernadette Kero . Getting home: Now, Addison is still forced to stay in the country as the government has not returned her passport . State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said at the time it was believed Addison was being held as a witness to the crime, and that they are doing everything in their power to secure her release. But since East Timor just gained independence in 2002, their justice system is still in development which has hindered the drug case, leaving Addison lonely, frightened and alone and in a strange country. The case took yet another negative turn on October 28, when she was arrested again and put behind bars in a cell. She was incarcerated at Gleno Women's Prison where she shared a cell with several other prisoners, including a women who just gave birth to a baby, and cares for the child behind bars. Addison, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley and UC Davis was living in Portland, Oregon before she set off on the second half of her trip earlier this year.","Stacey Addison of Klamath Falls, Oregon was freed on Christmas day after spending four months in a women's prison in East Timor .

"Ridley Scott's new biblical epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' has been banned in Egypt because of 'historical inaccuracies'. The head of the censorship board said these included a claim that the Pyramids were built by Jews, and that an earthquake, not a miracle by Moses, caused the parting of the Red Sea. Morocco has also reportedly banned the film, which stars Christian Bale as Moses, despite the fact that state-run Moroccan Cinema Centre (CCM) gave the movie the green light. Cinema owners in Morocco claimed that they were given a 'verbal' directive to not show the movie by the CCM on Wednesday - just a day before its planned release. Ridley Scott's new biblical epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' starring Christian Bale (pictured) as Moses has reportedly been banned in Morocco . Hassan Belkady, said he was threatened with the closure of his multiplex, Cinema Rif in Casablanca, if he didn't comply. 'They phoned and threatened they would shut down the theatre if I did not take the film off the schedule,' he said. The film tells the story of Moses rising up in defiance against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 600,000 slaves on a journey of escape amid a series of plagues. Moses is considered a prophet in Islam which is the predominant religion in Egypt and Morocco. The religion is opposed to visual depictions of its prophets. The film tells the story of Moses rising up in defiance against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, played by Joel Edgerton (left) Mr Scott has already come under fire over the decision to cast white actors in the lead roles, despite depicting events in the Middle East and north Africa . The managers of the Renaissance cinema in Rabat said they were told the ban was nationwide, TelQuel magazine reported. Mr Scott has already come under fire over the decision to cast white actors in the lead roles, despite depicting events in the Middle East and north Africa. The veteran British film-maker who directed Gladiator and Alien said casting on his Moses epic was predicated on the need to attract financial backing. Christian Bale, who plays Moses, caused upset last month after he described his character as 'barbaric' and 'schizophrenic' at a press conference. Speaking in Los Angeles, Bale said he had undertaken significant research for the role in the Biblical epic, reading the Torah, the Koran and Jonathan Kirsch's life of Moses. The actor said: 'I think the man was likely schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life.' Mr Bale also said he was surprised by the complexity of the Old Testament figure – and his creator. CCM chief Sarim Fassi-Fihri declined to comment on the decision. Biblical epics have made a comeback this year with Darren Aronofsky's Noah and Son of God from the producers of the highly successful TV series The Bible.","Egypt has banned 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' due to historical inaccuracies .

"Loujain Hathloul, 25,  is one of two women to face a special 'terrorism' tribunal after she tried to drive into Saudi Arabia, flouting a ban on women motorists . Two women's rights campaigners who tried to drive into Saudi Arabia are set to face a special 'terrorism' court, activists said. Loujain Hathloul, 25, was arrested after she tried to drive into the country from neighbouring United Arab Emirates, flouting the ban on women motorists. Maysaa Alamoudi, 33, a UAE-based Saudi journalist, arrived at the border to support Hathloul and was also detained. Activists claim that it is the first time female motorists have been referred to the criminal court in the capital of Riyadh, which was established to try terrorism cases. The pair have now been held by the authorities since December 1, and their detention is thought to be the longest yet for any women who defied the driving ban. Campaigners said investigations surrounding the women appeared to focus on their social media activities rather than their driving. They now fear the case is being used to send a warning to others pushing for greater rights. The ruling to send the pair to the special court was made at a hearing in Al-Ahsa, in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, it was claimed. 'They will transfer her case to the terrorism court,' said one activist familiar, who declined to be named, with the Hathloul  case, adding that her lawyer plans to appeal. A second activist confirmed that Alamoudi's case was also being moved to the specialist tribunal. Hathloul has 228,000 followers on the social networking site Twitter. Before her arrest she posted details of the 24 hours she spent waiting to cross into Saudi Arabia after border officers stopped her on November 30. Loujain Hathloul, pictured, has been detained for more than a month with journalist Maysaa Alamoudi. Ms al-Hathloul posted a video showing her driving towards the Saudi Arabia border where she was arrested on December 1 . Alamoudi has 131,000 followers and has also hosted a programme on YouTube discussing the driving ban. In early December Saudi authorities blocked the website of a regional human rights group which reported the women's case. Reporters Without Borders, a watchdog, this year named Saudi Arabia as one of 19 countries where government agencies are 'enemies of the Internet' for their censorship and surveillance. In October, dozens of women posted images online of themselves behind the wheel as part of an online campaign supporting the right to drive. In response, the Ministry of Interior said it would 'strictly implement' measures against anyone undermining 'the social cohesion'. Activists say women's driving is not technically illegal but that the ban is linked to tradition and custom in the conservative kingdom.","Saudi Arabia is the only country that does not allow women to drive .

"One of the masterminds of the Pakistan school massacre in which 132 children were slaughtered has been killed in a raid carried out by government security forces, officials claim. A top government official in the Khyber tribal region said security forces conducted a raid in the Bara area late Thursday night which left leading Taliban commander Saddam Jan dead. The troops were involved in a gunfight with Jan and a group of those living with him, said Shahab Ali Shah, the head of police administration in Khyber, near the Afghan border. A Pakistani soldier stands guard at the site of the militants' attack on a school in Peshawar. Officials now claim to have killed one of those responsible for helping plan the slaughter . Pools of dry blood stain the floor and upturned chairs lie scattered in a conference room of the school where militants massacred more than 130 children . A soldier stands amid the rubble and bullet-ridden walls of the Army Public School, Peshawar . He said Saddam - a commander in the Pakistani Taliban - was killed in the hour-long shootout, while his six accomplices were injured and arrested. While the Peshawar attack was ordered by Umar Mansoor on behalf of Maulana Fazlullah, the leader of Pakistan's Tehrik-e-Taliban, the planning was carried out by Jan. Abu Shah added that Jan had previously been identified as being behind attacks on health workers giving polio vaccinations in the Peshawar valley, and another attack on paramilitary scouts. His death is the latest retaliatory strike carried out by the Pakistani government following the slaughter of  132 children at a Peshawar school on December 16. In the wake of the attacks Pakistan repealed its ban on the death penalty and has since executed six militants, while military courts have been set up to fast-track terror trials. The brutal massacre, in which seven members of the Pakistani Taliban systematically slaughtered 150 people, was internationally condemned. In other strikes, a suspected U.S. drone fired missiles at two compounds in Pakistan's North Waziristan today, killing at least seven alleged militants. Intelligence officials said the early morning strikes hit the compounds of the Punjabi Taliban and a group of Uzbek militants in the Shawal area of North Waziristan, killing four and three militants respectively. They said the Punjabi Taliban compound was being used as a training facility by the group's commander, Qari Imran, but it was unclear whether Imran himself was present at the time of attack. The Pakistani Army has stepped up its efforts to eradicate the Taliban in the wake of what was one of the worst acts of terrorism in the country's modern history. Pictured is an army soldier standing guard . And in the second strike, the drone-launched missile struck the compound of a group of Uzbek militants in the village of Mangrotai, killing three. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. Drone strikes are largely unpopular in Pakistan where many consider them a violation of the country's sovereignty and resent the collateral damage caused to Pakistani civilians. But the U.S. insists these attacks are effective to eliminate militants in areas inaccessible to the Pakistani military. Meanwhile, the government has reinstated the death penalty and formed military courts for terrorist-related cases as part of an ambitious anti-terrorism plan. After almost 11 hours of deliberations with leaders of political parties, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said strong action was needed to root out extremism and warned no mercy would be shown to those behind attacks. He announced the establishment of military courts as part of the 17-point plan of action - a week after a six year moratorium on the death penalty was lifted for terror cases in the wake of the school attack - which is the deadliest assault by militants in Pakistani history.","A commander known as Saddam has been killed in security forces raid .

"Joanna Audoire suffered horrific burns to her leg after spilling a cup of McDonald's tea that she claims the lid had not been fitted properly on . A McDonald's customer suffered horrific burns after spilling a cup of tea that she claims the lid had not been fitted properly on. Joanna Audoire says as she sat down in her car with a tray containing the tea, the beverage toppled over covering her leg in boiling water. The 44-year-old mother-of-three is now considering suing the fast food restaurant after medics told her she would be scarred for life. Ms Audoire picked up a breakfast, a cup of tea, and a Coke from McDonald's to enjoy in her car after a shopping trip with a friend. She claimed that as she sat down the cup with the poorly fitted lid pitched over. When she removed her trousers she claims the skin on her left thigh peeled off too, leaving her with a huge bubbling L-shaped burn the size of her hand. The telemarketing worker was off work for more than a week because she couldn't walk properly due to the pain. Ms Audoire, from Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, said: 'I am seriously considering legal action for the time I have had to take off work and for the injury and trauma I have suffered. 'I was in immense pain. They need to take some responsibility for serving the tea as hot as that with a flimsy lid. 'When will they improve it? When a child is seriously burnt? It makes me cross. 'The lid couldn't have been on properly, and I know tea is hot, but was it too hot on this occasion? I think it was. It was very very painful. It shouldn't have happened.' Divorced Ms Audoire was shopping with a friend in Waltham Abbey, Essex, when they picked up food and drinks from the McDonald's nearby. She said she was sat in the passenger seat when she realised the Coke - which was in a cardboard holder with the tea - was about to topple, so she reached to grab it. Scroll down for video .

'I jumped out the car and was hopping around. At the time I had no idea the damage that had been caused,' she said. 'I got to work and I pulled my trousers down to go to the loo and it was horrible - the skin came off too. 'I got to the walk in centre and they treated it. They said it will probably scar.'

'You can use it wet for a dramatic effect, just pop a little bit of water on to your brush and apply the shadow for a really intense shade,' she adds. She uses eyeliner along the lash line and finishes with a little feline flick. 'Smudge some smoky shadow under the eyeline to add width to the eye,' she advises. She then advises women to suck in their cheeks so a natural shadow appears and to apply bronzer there. She goes on to explain the importance of lip liner. 'Every supermodel is never without their lipliner' she says before outlining Abbey's lips and slicking on  her K.I.S.S.I.N.G lipstick.

"With scenes of snow-covered mountains and plenty of alone time for couples, these retro posters that glamorise the golden days of Europe’s top ski resorts are being snapped up by collectors. The exclusive set features popular resorts, including Chamonix in France and St Moritz in Switzerland, and colourful portrayals of thrills on the slopes or relaxing times at the lodge. Created with an art deco style, the posters may look like they were created in the 1930s, but each one is a new design that harks back to the times when ski resorts were a playground for the affluent, and the lower classes made do with trips to the UK seaside. The retro posters feature popular ski resorts such as St Moritz (left) and Crans-Montana (right) in Switzerland . Printed on fine art cotton paper the prints are limited to runs of only 280 each, making them as exclusive as the resorts they portray . The creations have been brought up to date by featuring a range of modern skiing destinations, including Val d’Isere in France and St Anton in Austria. Printed on fine art cotton paper the prints are limited to runs of only 280 each, making them as exclusive as the resorts they portray. But at £395 each, the 3ft by 2ft posters cost a fraction of the tens of thousands of pounds that original vintage ones sell for. They are the brainchild of vintage poster dealer Simon Khachadourian, who runs a gallery in Chelsea, London. The exclusive set of more than 30 posters features  colourful portrayals of thrills on the slopes (right) or apres-ski romance (left) Simon commissioned artist Charles Avalon to reinvigorate the posters of old by creating a new set in the same art deco style. The result is the collection of 34 winter sports posters which can be bought from Pullman Limited Editions. Georgina Khachadourian, from Pullman Limited Editions, said: ‘My husband Simon has been dealing in vintage posters for 30 years and during that time he's seen the price of them rocket. The posters are the brainchild of vintage poster dealer Simon Khachadourian, who runs a gallery in Chelsea, London . ‘They were never made to last and print runs were often very limited so very few have survived and that has driven prices up. ‘Nowadays vintage posters are very collectable and sought after but they can sell for tens of thousands of pounds and that is beyond the means of most people. ‘Realising this we had the idea to commission artists to create a new set of winter sports posters in the same art deco style but at a price that was much more affordable.' Created with an art deco style, the adverts may look like they were created in the 1930s, but each one is a new design . Georgina added: ‘We have kept the stylised elements from that era in our posters but also brought them up to date by featuring resorts that are popular now and that perhaps didn't exist in the 1920s and 1930s. ‘The art deco winter sports posters are such an iconic look and we wanted people to be able to bring that style into their homes without breaking the bank. ‘Our posters are very popular and they sell to people all round the world. Often people buy posters of the places they go skiing to each year.’","Exclusive set features popular resorts such as Chamonix in France and St Moritz in Switzerland .

"It was a beautiful sunny morning for the Searle family as they sat by the pool in their Phuket hotel on Boxing Day in 2004. Jillian Searle and her two boys, from Perth, WA, were oblivious to the horror  that was about to unfold as the devastating tsunami hit the popular Thai island. Ms Searle recalls playing with Lachie, five, and Blake, two, as the first wave hit, before she was faced with a decision no mother should have to make - which of her two sons she should save. Scroll down for video . Jillian Searle celebrating Christmas with her two sons Lachie (front) and Blake (back) back in 2004 - just before their holiday in Thailand . Brothers Blake (left) and Lachie (right) who both survived the terrifying tsunami in Thailand's popular holiday island Phuket . The boys were holidaying with mum Jillian and dad Brad at the time of the disaster . She was getting young Blake and Lachie ready for a swim. Her husband had momentarily gone back to the room to get a spare pair of swimmers. 'I remember hearing what sounded like jet planes so I looked up at the sky and didn't see anything so I thought that was quite weird,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'At that point I also saw all these birds flying away and thought that was weird too. There were more than 5,000 people killed in the tsunami that struck Thailand - 26 of which were Australian. A decade on, commemorations have begun for the thousands of lives lost during the disaster. The tsunami, triggered by a 9.1-magnitude earthquake, hit just off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia and struck coastal communities across the Indian Ocean. It left about 230,000 people dead and caused about $10 billion in damage. When the disaster struck Australia pledged $1 billion in humanitarian funds and played a key role helping with the overwhelming task of identifying thousands of victims. 'Then these two security guards ran past us and were on their walkie talkies which is when I looked up and saw this enormous amount of water coming towards us at a very fast pace.' She grabbed her two-year-old and yelled at  Lachie to run for his life. 'I had Blake in my arm and grabbed Lachie's hand and I never looked back,' Ms Searle said. 'I remember getting into the hotel lobby, trying to get up on the breakfast bar but it was too full. 'I was yelling for help and then I saw this teenage girl, Elise, and she put out her hand which is when I let go of Lachie because I thought he would be okay with her. 'I knew we would all die if I didn't let go of one of the boys. I just wouldn't have had anything to fight the water.' That was the moment she let go of Lachie, hoping he would survive, as she got pulled under the water while she held onto Blake. 'At one point I thought I was underwater forever,' Ms Searle said. 'But every now and then when I got up above the water I could hear Blake screaming - so I knew he was still alive.' Jillian (pictured) was holding Blake (front) in her arms as she got swept up in the tsunami. She was holding Lachie's hand but had to let go .

An image which captures the moment people fled from a tidal wave approaching the coast in Phuket . Once she found safety, Ms Searle waded through the water in desperate search for Lachie. 'I saw Elise and I asked where he was and she said she had to let go because they were getting pulled out by the water again,' Ms Searle said. 'When she told me that I just screamed.' But there wasn't much time for Ms Searle to grieve as she was alerted of a second tsunami that was on its way. 'I could hear whistles blowing and people were yelling that the next wave was coming soon,' she said. She was rushed to higher ground where she met her husband and told him the devastating news. 'I told my husband at the time that I'd lost Lachie,' Ms Searle said. 'Brad just took off and I didn't see him for awhile because he went looking for our son.' Once the worst had surpassed, everyone was taken up to the roof of the hotel where Ms Searle had to play the painful waiting game. 'When I finally saw Brad up on the roof he told me that he couldn't find Lachie and I just lost it,' she said. 'I was hysterical. Sobbing and screaming. I started to feel bad and there was so much guilt. 'I had all sorts of things going through my mind - like bringing back Lachie's body bag and packing up his bedroom back at home. I wasn't sure how I would get through his birthdays and the Christmases without him.' For Lachie, who's now 15, the fear and the memories of his nightmare holiday still remain . Mum Jillian is grateful each year to spend Christmas with her boys Lachie (left) and Blake (right) Blake, now 11, is also lucky to be alive after being pulled under water several times during the tsunami . An hour had passed and Lachie was still missing. Ms Searle was convinced she would never see her son again. 'I thought he was dead. Lachie couldn't swim,' she said. 'So by that point everyone knew I'd lost Lachie but then someone said: ""hey isn't that the Lachie who's been missing?"". 'I opened my eyes and tried to wipe away my tears because everything was so blurry that I couldn't see. But then I saw a blue rashie - one that Lachie wore - and I just knew it was him. 'I just couldn't believe he was there, right in front of me. 'He didn't even have a scratch on him. He was perfect and was found by some security guards. And the first thing he said to me was ""mummy I'm really dirty, I need a shower"". 'I felt really lucky. It obviously wasn't our time and somebody was watching over us. 'Amazing - that's one word to describe it.' A woman offers prayers on a tiled memorial wall in Thailand displaying names of victims from the Boxing Day tsunami that left more than 230,000 people dead in 14 countries . Family members of victims stand in silent memory after placing flowers into the sea in Thailand . Although Lachie, who's now 15, doesn't remember much of the day he remembers hanging onto a door for a couple of hours. 'I don't know how I survived but I guess when you're in survival mode and that strong mentality, you really don't know your own strengths,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I didn't even know what a tsunami was. I was only five. I just knew it was this big wave that wiped out everything.' In hindsight, Lachie says his mum made the right decision in letting him go. 'My brother was younger and had no chance of survival,' he said. 'I knew it had to be done and I think mum made a smart decision.' While the Searles were the lucky few who lived to tell their tales of survival, there were more than 5,000 people killed in the tsunami that struck Thailand - 26 of which were Australian. A decade on, commemorations have begun for the thousands of lives lost during the disaster. The tsunami, triggered by a 9.1-magnitude earthquake, hit just off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia and struck coastal communities across the Indian Ocean. It left about 230,000 people dead. But since the terrifying ordeal, Lachie and his family haven't been able to go back to Thailand. 'I think I'd like to go one day for a bit of closure but I just wouldn't put the boys through that at the moment,' Ms Searle said. For Lachie, the fear and the memories of his nightmare holiday still remain. 'Maybe I'll go when I'm a bit older but I wouldn't like to go now,' Lachie said. Countries in the Indo-Pacific prepare to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the devastating Boxing Day tsunami in 2004 which left an estimated 230,000 people dead. The main commemoration ceremonies are planned in Thailand and Indonesia where the worst death and destruction took place. A series of ceremonies will be held in the country over the next three days to remember the victims. More than 4,000 people lost their lives at Khao Lak, north of Phuket, where many Germans and Scandinavians were holidaying. Thousands of Indonesians gathered in Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh province on Sumatra, to hold a memorial service. Banda Aceh was largely flattened by the earthquake and subsequent waves and around 170,000 people died. Indonesia bore the brunt of the disaster, with 130,736 people losing their lives. Sri Lanka suffered the second highest number of deaths with 35,322 people killed in the tragedy. The tsunamis also devastated coastal communities in India, the Maldives, Myanmar (Burma), Malaysia, Somalia, Tanzania, Seychelles, Bangladesh and Kenya. Coastal towns in India's Tamil Nadu state were devastated by the 2004 tsunami.","Jillian Searle was on a family holiday in Phuket, Thailand 10 years ago .

"Vladimir Putin cancelled his government's festive holiday yesterday, calling politicians back to the Kremlin to try to save the ailing economy. The Russian president told subordinates they could not afford a long break this year as the country's financial climate was in such a dire state. Last week Barack Obama warned the country's currency was on the brink of collapse after a series of punitive trade sanctions were imposed as a result of the Ukraine conflict. Putin warned the government 'could not afford' to take a long festive break and that they must try to save the flailing economy . Putin is reported to have told ministers via state television that they 'could not afford such extensive holidays, at least not this year.' 'You know what I am talking about,' he said, before insisting he had been 'making efforts to change the structure of our economy.' 'Quite a lot has been done in this direction, however, recent events show that this is not enough,' CNN reports him as saying. Earlier this week the leader discouraged politicians from increasing the price of vodka despite the country's economic woes. He warned colleagues that hiking the prices of strong spirits would provoke bootleg businesses to brew cheap liquor that would be dangerous to the country's health. Meanwhile Siberian senator told women not to indulge in buying expensive, foreign cosmetics to save money. Igor Chernishev suggested women who could not afford expensive imported lipstick could opt for the ‘natural look’ or even use beetroot as an alternative to make-up. American President Barack Obama warned Vladimir Putin that Russia was at the centre of of 'huge economic contraction' following the conflict with Ukraine . Mr Chernishev, who represents the city of Tomsk, wrote on a Russian website: ‘Women can live without imported lipstick, men like a natural look. ‘And if they really must use make-up on the lips – there’s no problem, they can use beetroot. It’s natural and chemicals don’t enter the body.’ The Russian economy is the most damaged it has been since 1998 when the country devalued the rouble and defaulted on its debt. Sanctions imposed by the West and the falling price of oil is likely to push the country into recession in 2015.

"A judge has ruled that the Department of Veterans Affairs was justified in firing the former director of its Phoenix, Arizona, office, but not because of delays in care and secret waiting lists that consumed the agency this year. Instead, the VA had the grounds to fire Sharon Helman over 'inappropriate gifts' she received from a health care consulting organization, including a trip to Disneyland 'in excess of $11,000,' tickets to a Beyonce concert and entry for the Mississippi Blues marathon, Chief Administrative Law Judge Stephen C. Mish said. Helman was removed from her job after the Phoenix VA became the epicenter of a national scandal over the quality of care for veterans amid allegations that patients were dying while waiting to see a doctor. She appealed her firing on several grounds, and the court ruled against her this week. This photo, taken in April, shows Sharon Helman, former director of Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care Center. A judge has ruled that the Department of Veterans Affairs was justified in firing her, but not because of delays in care and secret waiting lists that contributed to the deaths of more than 40 veterans . A VA investigation found that at least 40 patients died while awaiting for appointments in Phoenix. Officials could not 'conclusively assert' that the delays caused the deaths, however. The judge also found that Helman could not be fired because of the secret lists and long wait times, saying the VA did not prove that Helman knew about her employees' covert system. Julie Perkins, Helman's lawyer, said the former director was 'scapegoated to appease Congress' but was happy the judge didn't find her at fault for any of the allegations of secret wait lists and patient deaths. Her law firm said in a statement that the judge's decision set the 'sets story straight.' 'Sharon Helman did not kill veterans. Sharon Helman did not manipulate wait time data. The VA’s preferred storyline has been proven a fabrication, of which the VA was aware the entire time,' Shaw Bransford & Roth P.C. said. Several whistleblowers had accused Helman of ordering the manipulations for personal benefit so that she would receive large bonuses from the VA, something Helman has steadfastly denied. 'She was completely vindicated of that,' Perkins said. The VA also issued a statement in which it touted the many reforms it has implemented in recent months, including reaching out to 4,000 vets to accelerate their care and scheduling many more appointments. 'We are making progress in improving access to care at Phoenix and VA facilities nationwide, and we are pleased that [the] decision today helps us begin to put the leadership failures at Phoenix behind us,' it said. Congressman Jeff Miller, chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said that the ruling serves as a reminder that additional employees at the Phoenix VA who had direct knowledge of and participated in the secondary wait list system must still be brought to justice. 'While I am glad the MSPB upheld Sharon Helman’s firing, the fact that the ruling did not connect the central figure of VA’s wait time scandal to any wait time schemes demonstrates a huge problem with the way this case was handled,' he told the Washington Post. 'Additionally, this decision highlights how there are many other Phoenix VAMC employees who have contributed to the facility’s problems. It’s absolutely critical that VA take steps to ensure these individuals are held accountable as soon as possible to the maximum extent under the law.' Miller also called for a 'detailed investigation' into whether Veterans Affairs Department official in Washington, D.C. 'knew about widespread wait time fraud and when they knew it.' 'VA leaders owe it to our veterans and America’s taxpayers to seek answers to these unknowns,' he said. Former VA Director Eric Shinseki resigned in May at the height of the scandal and has since been replaced by Robert McDonald. McDonald said last month that his agency planned to take 'aggressive, expeditious disciplinary action, consistent with the law' against more than 1,000 VA employees involved in cover-ups of how long patients were waiting to be seen by doctors. A judge ruled this week that Helman could not be fired from her job at this VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, because of the secret lists and long wait times, saying the VA did not prove that she knew about her employees' covert system . Helman's lawyer declined this week to comment  to the Associated Press on the allegations that Helman had been receiving gifts from a lobbyist 'seeking to do business' with the VA in violation of the department's policy because of a separate ongoing criminal grand jury proceeding  happening now in Phoenix. The judge for the Merit Systems Protection Board found that Helman accepted nine improper gifts from Dennis 'Max' Lewis, vice president for Jefferson Consulting Group. The gifts included airfare around the country, notably a trip to Disneyland 'in excess of $11,000 for what appears to be six of her family members for an 8-night stay' and $729.50 for five tickets - and parking - to an August 2013 Beyonce concert. The consulting group had clients with government health care contracts or were seeking such deals, and the judge said Helman should have known it was wrong to take gifts from such a group. 'I find it difficult to believe that she accepted over $13,000 in gifts from Lewis over a two-year period ... without knowing what he did for a living,' Mish said. The judge also cited an email exchange between Helman and Lewis in which the then-director said 'Whoooo hoooo!' after the consultant said he was taking care of a marathon trip. Until Helman was fired in late November - more than six months after her hospital came under scrutiny - she continued to receive an $170,000 annual salary even though she was on administrative leave. A new law passed in the wake of the matter ensures that an offending executive at the VA would be removed swiftly be from a position of power and knocked off the government payroll if similar circumstances were to arise in the future. Now employees have just seven days to appeal their firing to the the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the board must make its decision within 21 days, confining the entire proceedings to a single month.","Sharon Helman was removed from her job after the Phoenix VA became the epicenter of allegations that veterans died while waiting to see a doctor .

"A €1billion run on a recently nationalised Spanish bank has sparked further fears that the 17-nation eurozone is about to implode. European markets fell as fears of a continent-wide contagion from goverment-less Greece's economic crisis also spread. Shares in Bankia, Spain's fourth biggest bank formed in 2010 through a merger of seven struggling regional savings institutions, today plummeted by 27 per cent. Worry: A ¿1billion run on recently nationalised Spanish bank Bankia has sparked further fears that the 17-nation eurozone is about to implode . The pan-European FTSE 300 index was down 0.9 per cent at 984.22 points by 10.26.am, close to a four-and-a-half-month low of 983.95 points reached yesterday. Spain's benchmark IBEX index fell nearly 2 per cent to its lowest level since mid-2003. It came following a report in El Mundo newspaper that its customers had withdrawn more than €1billion from their accounts over the past week. It added to losses incurred yesterday after the European Central Bank said it had stopped providing liquidity to some Greek banks because they had not been successfully recapitalised. Greece is set to hold fresh elections on June 17 after voters rejected austerity measures imposed on it by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which has heightened fears it will have to leave the eurozone. Investors are also worried by the possibility of contagion from a Greek exit from the euro spreading to other countries such as Spain or Italy. Change: French President Francois Hollande (right) has given his ministers a 30 per cent pay cut to mark a difference with Nicolas Sarkozy's (left) administration . 'It's not Greece leaving the euro that is the major issue, it's the domino effect,' said John Bearman, chief investment officer at British firm Thomas Miller Investment, which manages roughly €3billion worth of assets. Greece today held a swearing-in ceremony of Coalition of the Radical Left party leader Alexis Tsipras and former Prime Minister George Papandreou. But their leadership will be short-lived, as their parliament will be dissolved tomorrow so they can arrange new elections. The developments came as panicked savers in Greece also started to vote with their wallets, withdrawing a staggering £650million per day - more than eight times more than usual. It has led to the European Central Bank cutting off lending to at least four Greek banks, sparking fears they could collapse within days. And it has also seen rumours that Greece is about to limit the amount of money that can be taken from cashpoints. To add further pressure, credit ratings agency Moody's said it was reviewing 114 European institutions, which could result in widespread downgrades. Some banks may lose business, a smaller number could gain. Client exposures and risk may become even further concentrated amongst a limited number of market participants. On Monday, Moody's downgraded the long-term debt and deposit ratings for 26 Italian banks, prompting the Italian Banking Association to call the move an 'assault against Italy, its companies and its families'. Concerns over Spain were highlighted by data showing the country had slipped back into recession during the first quarter, while the country's medium-term borrowing costs rose sharply during a bond auction. Tensions within the European banking system were also exposed by the fact that key eurozone three-month bank-to-bank lending rates had edged higher today for the first time since the European Central Bank pumped in ultra-cheap, three-year funds in December. Royal London Asset Management's European equities fund manager Neil Wilkinson said he had reduced his exposure to financial stocks in recent weeks, as a result of the worsening European debt crisis. Wilkinson, who manages around £425million worth of assets, said his portfolio was 70 per cent invested in northern European equities markets such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, with a small amount in Italy and Spain. Wilkinson said he owned Italian bank Intesa and Spanish pharmaceuticals group Grifols, but was otherwise shying away from stocks in countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. 'The selling pressure is going to continue,' he said. News of the run came as France's new President marked his first official day in the office by slashing his ministers' pay by 30 per cent. Short-lived: Greece's Coalition of the Radical Left party leader Alexis Tsipras (second right) and former Prime Minister George Papandreou (right) are sworn-in at the Greek Parliament today. The parliament will be dissolved tomorrow . Francois Hollande's new Socialist government said it was 'setting an example' with the symbolic move, aimed at drawing a clear distinction with the previous administration. Nicolas Sarkozy, voted out of power earlier this month, famously hiked up his pay 170 per cent to €19,000 per month on taking office in 2007. Senior ministers then said their first concern was tackling the European sovereign debt crisis - and promoting their new boss's view of shifting the focus from austerity to growth. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told news channel BFMTV: 'The priority is to disentangle the crisis in Europe. 'I am profoundly European but we need a different Europe, a Europe that is much more focused on jobs.'

"The Irish High Court has said doctors may switch off the life support machine of a pregnant woman who has been clinically dead since December 3. The  Dublin-based court heard submissions on Christmas Eve on behalf of the woman, her family, her partner, the baby and the hospital involved - none of which can be named for legal reasons. Members of the woman's family waited in court as Judge Nicholas Kearns ruled that continuing with life support was a 'distressing exercise in futility'. High Court president Nicholas Kearns, pictured, ruled that the life support machine could be switched off . The High Court, pictured, ruled today that keeping the baby alive would be a 'distressing exercise in futility' The woman's father and her partner were forced to take a case to the High Court after the hospital involved refused to switch off life-support because medics found the baby still had a heartbeat. Following the eighth amendment  of the Irish Constitution, the unborn are given the same constitutional rights as the mother. The mother, who is in her 20s, suffered a catastrophic brain injury on November 29 after falling over in a hospital bathroom. She was transferred from that hospital, which is outside Dublin, to a specialist centre in the capital for assessment. Following tests,  it was determined on December 3 that she was brain dead. She was returned to the original hospital who insisted on continuing life support despite the objections of her family. Medics in the case feared they would be prosecuted if they switched off the life-support system because there still was a foetal heart beat, despite medical evidence that there was very little chance the baby would be born alive. Members of the woman's family have sought to switch the equipment off to preserve her dignity. The High Court heard that the woman's two small children have been told that their mother 'is being looked after by the nurses ""until the angels appear"".' The three-judge panel, comprising president of the High Court Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns, Ms Justice Marie Baker and Ms Justice Caroline Costello, gave their decision in Dublin in a 29 page ruling at lunchtime. The baby's legal team announced that it will not be appealing the decision to the Supreme Court. In a landmark ruling, Dublin's High Court said keeping the young mother alive would deprive her of dignity in death and subject her father, partner and two young children to 'unimaginable distress' in a 'futile exercise'. The panel of judges said it was in the best interest of the unborn child to authorise the withdrawal of life support in what was a 'tragic and unfortunate case'. The High Court added that it was a case of 'great public importance', and that the woman's family and partner would not have to pay costs for taking the case. Members of the woman's family have sought to switch the equipment off to preserve her dignity . In a 29-page written judgement, Justice Kearns said: 'The court is satisfied, in the circumstances of this case, that in the best interest of the unborn child, it should authorise at the discretion of the medical team the withdrawal of ongoing somatic support being provided in this tragic and unfortunate case. 'It will accordingly make a declaration and order to that effect.' Mr Justice Kearns and his two colleagues ruled: 'To maintain and continue the present somatic support for the mother would deprive her of dignity in death and subject her father, her partner and her young children to unimaginable distress in a futile exercise which commenced only because of fears held by treating medical specialists of potential consequences.' The court ruled: 'The condition of the mother is failing at such a rate and to such a degree that it will not be possible for the pregnancy to progress much further or to a point where any form of live birth will be possible.' The High Court heard that the woman had developed a number of infections and her brain was beginning to rot. Paul Connors, communications director with the HSE, said it was a very welcome decision at the end of a very traumatic number of days for the woman's family. He said: 'Certainly, it brings a great degree of clarity to these particular situations.' Ireland's Health Minister Leo Varadkar said he would be carefully examining the implication of the ruling. 'I wish to convey my heartfelt sympathies to the family and partner of the woman at the centre of this case at this most difficult time - particularly given the season,' he said. 'This case and the judgement will need to be carefully examined before I can make any further comment on it. 'In the meantime, I would ask that the privacy of this family is respected, at this so difficult and challenging time.' The High Court heard that the woman suffered a head wound in a bathroom fall in hospital on November 29 after being admitted for nausea and headaches. A catastrophic fluid build-up in her brain led to her being declared clinically dead four days later. Such is her physical deterioration since then that one of her children was left very distressed at her appearance when she last saw her, the High Court was told. Dr Frances Colreavy, an intensive care specialist, had told the court she inspected the woman's body on Monday and found it unrecognisable compared to a photo of her by her bedside. Having practised medicine for decades in Ireland and Australia, she had never witnessed a clinically-dead person being kept on life support for so long, the court was told. She said the woman's blood was becoming increasingly toxic. Dr Peter McKenna, former master of Dublin's Rotunda Maternity Hospital, said if the treatment was not halted it would go 'from the extraordinary to the grotesque'.","The woman in her 20s was declared clinically dead in on December 3 .

"Skiers and resorts in the snow-starved French Alps have endured one of the worst starts to their season in recent memory, but it appears Mother Nature is poised to make up for it. With the slopes void of snow and openings delayed thanks to unseasonably warm weather that has persisted throughout December, the region is set to be walloped by a severe blizzard this weekend. Meteo France has issued weather alerts for the Northern Alps, which are expecting 24in of snow on Saturday and an additional 12in on Sunday, in addition to wind gusts of nearly 50mph. Scroll down for video . The ski station at Les Gets in the French Alps switched on its artificial snow-making machines on Friday . The region has had a shortage of snow thanks to unseasonably warm weather that has delayed the season . Parts of the Vosges and Jura mountains could be blasted with as much as 30in after seeing a shortage of snow. Less snow is likely in the Southern Alps, although the total amount could top out at nearly 12in. While the powerful storm will likely create treacherous conditions, the sight of falling snow will bring a sigh of relief to frustrated resort operators and others whose livelihoods depend on traditional winter weather, and will no doubt bring delight to British skiers who are planning a winter getaway. Families have shown up over the Christmas break to find the slopes bare. The blizzard will be followed by colder temperatures, meaning this weekend's snowfall will stick around and the ski season will finally get underway. Les Gets could be blasted with as much of 30in of snow this weekend as a severe blizzard moves in . As the temperature dipped a few degrees below the freezing mark on Friday ski resorts switched on their snow-making machines after growing impatient with the weather. The ski station in Les Gets, in the Northern Alps, turned on its snow cannon to fill in slopes which have been green since a November snowfall melted away. Up until now the conditions have been unfavourable for artificial snow-making – even at altitude – as the temperature failed to drop to -4C, the ideal value.

But the national weather service said such a lack of snow is not that unusual as it occurs roughly every five years.

"Three families of children orphaned by Ebola were able to celebrate Christmas yesterday after MailOnline and UK charity Street Child stepped in to make sure they did not miss out. The children had been left to fend for themselves despite a multi-million pound international appeal to raise funds to help and despite promises from the Liberian government that they would be helped. Their plight is that of tens of thousands of other children - an estimated 42,000 in Liberia and Sierra Leone - who have lost parents to the deadly virus, which has killed 7,518 people in West Africa this year this year. The Mail returned to the slums of Monrovia yesterday to check up on the children whose plight we highlighted in a series of reports last month. We wanted to make sure that they would not only be able to enjoy Christmas this year, but for many more years to come. Instead, we found that they had been abandoned. In September, Chancy Kpaingba, 15, watched his mother die in the bed next to him at an Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia. Chancy survived, but with his father already dead, the boy and his four brothers and sisters found themselves orphaned and on their own. Chancy Kpaingba (back right) watched his mother die next to him in a bed at an Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia. Here the family are pictured with food and toys provided by MailOnline and Street Child. Clockwise from top left is Odell, 17, Daniel, five months, Chancy, 15, Otis, 8, and Josiah, 5 . Chancy Kpaingba recovered after contracting Ebola while it killed his mother in the bed beside him . Odell holds her infant brother Daniel beside her brothers (from left) Josiah, Otis and Chancy. They claim no-one from the government or aid agencies had contacted them until MailOnline spoke to them . Chancy and his late mother Catherine Kpaingba are pictured together left. On the right, they are pictured with Josiah and Otis . Sitting outside the tin shack of a relative who is trying to look after them, Chancy said: 'We are missing our parents, I don't have any new clothes to wear today. 'Look at my friends - they have clothes to wear. I remember during the Christmas season mother use to take us to the market and buy clothes and toys for us, but today they are dead.' He began to cry. His 17-year-old sister, Odell, said they had been abandoned since the deaths of their parents. No-one from the government or the international aid organisations had done anything to give them a future, she said. 'I am frustrated because we have being abandoned by family members as well as the government. Today is Christmas: how will we be happy with no Ma or Pa. No-one is helping us. It is very hard to get food everyday because our aunt whom is taking care of us does not have any money or any support,' she said. Since the death of their parents, other people in the area were afraid of them and had shunned them, said Odell. They had to resort to begging for food from friends and family. 'At times I feel so sad that we have turned into a beggar because our parents have died. We don't even have something to remember them. No grave site. Only God is our hope now,' Odell said, and then she too burst into tears. Julia Duncan-Cassell, Liberia's development chief, said she would take a personal interest in the Kpainga family's case but the children say there has been no such intervention . The Kpaingba children should never have been in this position. Last month Liberia's minister for gender and development, Julia Duncan-Cassell, promised to take a personal interest in their case - and that of three other groups of orphans - after the Mail visited her in her office in Monrovia to highlight their plight. According to the children, there has been no such intervention. Liberia's politicians have been busy with senate elections this month. However, when challenged today, the minister instructed a member of her staff to contact the children immediately to offer them assistance. To try to help, the Mail contacted the UK charity Street Child, which has been working hard to provide a safety net for the orphans. Together we were able to deliver food and toys to three of the four families - one had gone out of the city - so that they could have a Christmas meal and a few presents. The presents included teddy bears, toy cats and dogs and toy cars. The food included Liberian staples - rice, vegetable oil, beans and salt. But the most important present was the once provided by Street Child, in the form of a promise of ongoing assistance to get them back on their feet. That includes a business grant for the friends and relatives who have taken them in to help them earn enough money to support the children. Street Child programme director Chloe Brett said the woman looking after the Kpaingba children was sitting in their compound with her head in her hands when the team arrived. 'She hadn't made any money at the market for three days and was thinking through how she might be able to provide food for the family tomorrow, or even today. She was hungry, sad and struggling. The arrival of Street Child meant we could give them food relief now and some toys for Xmas. We will help her set up her own small business in the new year so she no longer has to rely on odd jobs and unreliable income. I'm told the joy in her face was overwhelming: she felt like a miracle had occurred and all her prayers answered this Christmas.' The team also visited two other families featured in the Mail's reports last month - the Maccy and Moore children - in Monrovia's Clara Town slum and delivered the same package of presents, food and the promise of ongoing help. The Maccy family's mother died from Ebola in the Clara Town slum in Monrovia. Pictured from left is Younger, 14, Angel, 7, Mitta, 9, and Jebeh, 17 . The Maccy family (pictured) were left to fend for themselves and could no longer go to school after losing both their mother and father to Ebola . Hope of medical school but no money to pay for it: The Maccy siblings' mother sold food at the market but she wanted better for her children . Many other children were not so lucky. No parents meant no presents and little to eat yesterday. In Liberia, the worst hit country, 3,376 people have died. Many were parents with large families and their children faced their first Christmas on their own. Hundreds of millions of pounds of international aid has been pledged to the country but with much of the money directed to building and running treatment units, the fate of the survivors has taken a back seat. The Liberian authorities and some international aid agencies have been slow to tackle the problem, blaming the initial decision to concentrate on treatment centres for the failure to provide a safety net. Street Child is one of the few agencies actively targeting orphans, working with 10,000 children in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Brett estimates that there are 30,000 orphans in Sierra Leone, while Liberian government officials last month put the figure there at 12,000 or more. 'There are thousands of children left orphaned by the Ebola outbreak and the international community is being too slow to respond,' said Brett. 'Very little support is actually finding its way to the children who are left in their communities traumatised, grief stricken and in many cases starving to death. Abdulla Moore, 15, Christiana Moore, 6, and Abraham Moore, 12, were being looked after by a neighbour after both their parents died. Here they are pictured with supplies provided by MailOnline and Street Child . No hope of school: Christiana Moore in the Clara Town slum in Monrovia, Liberia, with her mother Bendu Moore's voting card . Ebola orphans: Abraham, Christiana, and Abdulla in their home in Clara Town slum in Monrovia, Liberia . 'In many cases their belongings will have been burned and their parents bodies removed, they are left with nothing but the stigma attached to them and nobody to turn to for help.' 'These children don't exist in a 'system' anywhere, they are abandoned in their communities.' She said government was managing to reach a few hundred children but the rest were on their own. 'The reality is nothing is reaching the thousands of kids that are outside of this and need help urgently,' she said. 'Street Child wants to do more – reach more children. We want to ensure all vulnerable orphaned children that we know about have enough rice to eat over the Christmas period and beyond this help them re-start a more prosperous life. Yes, West Africa most definitely does know it's Christmas time – when I was in Monrovia last week the city was blaring out the Christmas songs and artificial trees and tacky decorations were being sold on the side of most streets. These kids are facing the loneliest and hardest Christmas they will ever know, Ebola has affected the poorest communities meaning they are struggling more than ever to survive. The families that have taken in orphaned children will be struggling to care for their, now extended, family. 'Beyond the Christmas period we will ensure that each family that has taken in the orphaned children is trained and set up with a grant in a small business so that they can earn enough money.'

"Fashion heiress Margherita Missoni is pregnant with her second child with husband Eugenio Amos. The 31-year-old Italian, who gave birth to her first child, a son, Otto, in September last year, shared a picture of her growing baby bump on Instagram on Christmas Day, hinting to her 70,000 followers that she is expecting another boy. 'In case you had any doubt #MerryChristmas #mumsofboys #dressfortheoccasion,' she commented alongside the snap, which was taken at her family home in Varese, Italy. Expecting: Margherita Missoni revealed on Instagram that she is pregnant with her second child . Baby bump: The 31-year-old shared a second picture of her growing bump later on Christmas Day . While Margherita has not yet revealed when baby number two is due, her baby bump already looks fairly sizable, suggesting she is a fair few months into her pregnancy. The model, who married racing driver Eugenio in June 2012, shared a second snap of her bump later on Christmas Day, this time while wearing a festive glittery dress, this time captioning the picture with a series of suitable hashtags: '#weargoldforChristmas #bellyseries #festiveattire #dressfortheoccasion' During her first pregnancy, the keen Instagram user regularly documented her growing baby bump -and she has continued to share numerous pictures of one-year-old Otto since his birth. The happy news of Margherita's pregnancy comes less than two years after her uncle, Vittorio Missoni, and his wife Maurizia Castiglioni, died in a tragic plane accident. Big brother: Margherita and her husband, racing driver Eugenio Amos, already have a one-year-old son Otto . Happy families: Margherita and Eugenio were married in June 2012 . The plane, which went missing on January 4, 2013, in Venezuela, and the bodies of its passengers, were only recovered after an extensive six month search, during which time the Missoni family suffered another devastating loss when Margherita's grandfather Ottavio Missoni passed away. At the time, Margherita spoke out about how the news had affected her pregnancy - and she paid tribute to her family's unwavering strength, which she credited with helping her to cope with the tragedy. 'Of course, it was especially hard for me because I'm pregnant,' she told The Times in a profile published in August last year. 'I've had a very intense pregnancy, with all the things that have happened, but it wasn't my father; other family members have had a harder time. 'It has helped that there are so many of us and we are so tight. It's easier than if I were having to face it all on my own.'","The 31-year-old shared the couple's happy news in an Instagram post on Christmas Day .

"Upset at President Barack Obama's policies on Iran and Syria, members of Saudi Arabia's ruling family are threatening a rift with the United States that could take the alliance between Washington and the kingdom to its lowest point in years. Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief is vowing that the kingdom will make a 'major shift' in relations with the United States to protest perceived American inaction over Syria's civil war as well as recent U.S. overtures to Iran, a source close to Saudi policy said on Tuesday. Prince Bandar bin Sultan told European diplomats that the United States had failed to act effectively against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was growing closer to Tehran, and had failed to back Saudi support for Bahrain when it crushed an anti-government revolt in 2011, the source said. Scroll down for video . 'Major change': Prince Bandar Bin Sultan said the kingdom will make a ""major shift"" in relations with the United States . 'The shift away from the U.S. is a major one,' the source close to Saudi policy said. 'Saudi doesn't want to find itself any longer in a situation where it is dependent.' It was not immediately clear whether the reported statements by Prince Bandar, who was the Saudi ambassador to Washington for 22 years, had the full backing of King Abdullah. The growing breach between the United States and Saudi Arabia was also on display in Washington, where another senior Saudi prince criticized Obama's Middle East policies, accusing him of 'dithering' on Syria and Israeli-Palestinian peace. In unusually blunt public remarks, Prince Turki al-Faisal called Obama's policies in Syria 'lamentable' and ridiculed a U.S.-Russian deal to eliminate Assad's chemical weapons. He suggested it was a ruse to let Obama avoid military action in Syria. 'The current charade of international control over Bashar's chemical arsenal would be funny if it were not so blatantly perfidious. And designed not only to give Mr. Obama an opportunity to back down (from military strikes), but also to help Assad to butcher his people,' said Prince Turki, a member of the Saudi royal family and former director of Saudi intelligence. Inaction: The Saudis say they are getting upset by President Obama's inaction in dealing with the conflict in Syria . The United States and Saudi Arabia have been allies since the kingdom was declared in 1932, giving Riyadh a powerful military protector and Washington secure oil supplies. The Saudi criticism came days after the 40th anniversary of the October 1973 Arab oil embargo imposed to punish the West for supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur war. That was one of the low points in U.S.-Saudi ties, which were also badly shaken by the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Saudi Arabia gave a clear sign of its displeasure over Obama's foreign policy last week when it rejected a coveted two-year term on the U.N. Security Council in a display of anger over the failure of the international community to end the war in Syria and act on other Middle East issues. Prince Turki indicated that Saudi Arabia will not reverse that decision, which he said was a result of the Security Council's failure to stop Assad and implement its own decision on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Picking sides: Russian President Vladimir Putin, seen here with bin Sultan, has sided with the Syrian government in the conflict . 'There is nothing whimsical about the decision to forego membership of the Security Council. It is based on the ineffectual experience of that body,' he said in a speech to the Washington-based National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations. In London, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he discussed Riyadh's concerns when he met Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal in Paris on Monday. Kerry said he told the Saudi minister no deal with Iran was better than a bad deal. 'I have great confidence that the United States and Saudi Arabia will continue to be the close and important friends and allies that we have been,' Kerry told reporters. Prince Bandar is seen as a foreign policy hawk, especially on Iran. The Sunni Muslim kingdom's rivalry with Shi'ite Iran, an ally of Syria, has amplified sectarian tensions across the Middle East. A son of the late defense minister and crown prince, Prince Sultan, and a protégé of the late King Fahd, he fell from favor with King Abdullah after clashing on foreign policy in 2005. But he was called in from the cold last year with a mandate to bring down Assad, diplomats in the Gulf say. Over the past year, he has led Saudi efforts to bring arms and other aid to Syrian rebels. 'Prince Bandar told diplomats that he plans to limit interaction with the U.S.,' the source close to Saudi policy said. Secretary of State John Kerry says he's confident the U.S. will continue to have a good relationship with Saudi Arabia . This happens after the U.S. failed to take any effective action on Syria and Palestine. Relations with the U.S. have been deteriorating for a while, as Saudi feels that the U.S. is growing closer with Iran and the U.S. also failed to support Saudi during the Bahrain uprising,"" the source said. The source declined to provide more details of Bandar's talks with the diplomats, which took place in the past few days. But he suggested that the planned change in ties between the energy superpower and the United States would have wide-ranging consequences, including on arms purchases and oil sales. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, ploughs much of its earnings back into U.S. assets. Most of the Saudi central bank's net foreign assets of $690 billion are thought to be denominated in dollars, much of them in U.S. Treasury bonds. 'All options are on the table now, and for sure there will be some impact,' the Saudi source said. He said there would be no further coordination with the United States over the war in Syria, where the Saudis have armed and financed rebel groups fighting Assad. The kingdom has informed the United States of its actions in Syria, and diplomats say it has respected U.S. requests not to supply the groups with advanced weaponry that the West fears could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-aligned groups. Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki Al Faisal also is outraged the international community has let the war continue in Syria . Saudi anger boiled over after Washington refrained from military strikes in response to a poison gas attack in Damascus in August when Assad agreed to give up his chemical weapons arsenal. Representative Chris Van Hollen, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives' Democratic leadership, told Reuters' Washington Summit on Tuesday that the Saudi moves were intended to pressure Obama to take action in Syria. 'We know their game. They're trying to send a signal that we should all get involved militarily in Syria, and I think that would be a big mistake to get in the middle of the Syrian civil war,' Van Hollen said. 'And the Saudis should start by stopping their funding of the al Qaeda-related groups in Syria. In addition to the fact that it's a country that doesn't allow women to drive,' said Van Hollen, who is close to Obama on domestic issues in Congress but is less influential on foreign policy. Saudi Arabia is concerned about signs of a tentative reconciliation between Washington and Tehran, something Riyadh fears may lead to a 'grand bargain' on the Iranian nuclear program that would leave Riyadh at a disadvantage. Prince Turki expressed doubt that Obama would succeed in what he called an 'open arms approach' to Iran, which he accused of meddling in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Bahrain. 'We Saudis observe President Obama's efforts in this regard. The road ahead is arduous,' he said. 'Whether (Iranian President Hassan) Rouhani will succeed in steering Iran toward sensible policies is already contested in Iran. The forces of darkness in Qom and Tehran are well entrenched.' The U.N. Security Council has been paralyzed over the 31-month-old Syria conflict, with permanent members Russia and China repeatedly blocking measures to condemn Assad. Saudi Arabia backs Assad's mostly Sunni rebel foes. The Syrian leader, whose Alawite sect is derived from Shi'ite Islam, has support from Iran and the armed Lebanese Shi'ite movement Hezbollah. The Syrian leader denounces the insurgents as al Qaeda-linked groups backed by Sunni-ruled states. In Bahrain, home of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, a simmering pro-democracy revolt by its Shi'ite majority has prompted calls by some in Washington for U.S. ships to be based elsewhere. Many U.S. economic interests in Saudi Arabia involve government contracts in defense, other security sectors, health care, education, information technology and construction.","Saudi Arabia is an important ally to the U.S. as it provides a secure source of oil .
