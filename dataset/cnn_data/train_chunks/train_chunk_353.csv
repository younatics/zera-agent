"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan checked into a California rehab center early Friday, ending -- at least for now -- a drama that has had more twists and turns than a high-speed car chase. Shawn Holley, the lawyer who guided Lohan through years of legal turmoil until the actress abruptly fired her in January, helped her avoid jail once again by brokering a deal, her father told CNN Friday. ""I am so thankful to Shawn Holley and Evan Haney, her manager, for doing this,"" Michael Lohan said. While he wouldn't name the California facility his daughter entered, he noted it is a rehab program she's been in before. The actress underwent three months of court-ordered substance abuse rehab at the Betty Ford Clinic at the end of 2010, but she was in legal trouble again weeks later -- facing a shoplifting charge that led to her current woes. Lohan, 26, ""wants to settle in"" for a few days while arrangements can be made to transfer her to the Lukens Institute in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which bills itself as a ""luxury rehab center,"" Michael Lohan said. ""The Lukens Institute is where she wanted to go all along -- a place she will get the right treatment and finally get better,"" Michael Lohan said. Santa Monica City Attorney Terry White, who must approve any transfer, has not responded to CNN calls for comment. The actress was supposed to start a 90-day stint in a ""lockdown"" rehab center Thursday, an alternative to a three-month jail term for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in March. But she abruptly left the Southern California facility where she had gone Thursday morning because ""she was not happy with the place,"" her father said. Michael Lohan said he was not happy with it either because of the revelation that the facility -- Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach -- can't provide alcohol and drug rehab treatments because California officials revoked its license. ""If a 24-hour residential facility is providing treatment or services to promote the recovery of alcohol and drug abuse then they must possess a license,"" said Millicent Tidwell, deputy director for the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. None of Morningside's several locations in California are licensed, Tidwell said. The company previously had three licenses, but all were revoked. The state's licensing agency is in litigation with Morningside's unlicensed Newport Beach facility, she said. It's unclear whether Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Dabney knew Morningside was unlicensed when Lohan's lawyer, Mark Heller, informed him in court Thursday morning that she would spend her rehab sentence there. White objected at Thursday's hearing, saying Heller didn't get prior approval for Lohan to go to Morningside. White said he needed time to investigate it. ""Lindsay had no idea that Morningside wasn't approved,"" Michael Lohan said. Heller has not respond to several CNN requests for comment. The judge ordered the treatment after Lohan entered pleas of no contest on charges relating to a traffic accident and, with those convictions, she was found in violation of her shoplifting probation. Her six years of legal troubles trace back to two drunken driving arrests in 2007 and include other incidents in which she was behind the wheel. Lohan was charged with reckless driving and lying to a police officer about a June 2012 car crash in which her Porsche hit a dump truck on the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica, California. Her arrest triggered the probation violation charge. The police report said Lohan denied being behind the wheel, but the prosecutor was expected to call witnesses who say she was driving. Lindsay Lohan acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances. She's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since January 2007, including one long court-ordered stint after a failed drug test. The actress has appeared in court at least 20 times before four Los Angeles judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail. Lohan has spent about two weeks behind bars in six trips to the Los Angeles County jail, served 35 days under house arrest and worked about 67 days of community service at the county morgue.","NEW: The lawyer Lindsay Lohan fired in January returns to help her avoid jail again .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blasted Democrat Mary Burke on Monday, saying the Wisconsin gubernatorial hopeful can't be trusted after her campaign hired a political consultant who appeared to plagiarize parts of her job plan from other candidates. ""I don't think they were teaching plagiarism at Harvard Business School. I don't think they were teaching you to cut and paste other peoples' work and call it your own,"" Christie said at an event for Republican Gov. Scott Walker in Hudson, Wisconsin. Burke, a former Trek Bicycle executive who has a business degree from Harvard, fired consultant Eric Schnurer earlier this month after BuzzFeed reported that portions of her jobs plan were apparently plagiarized from former candidates in other states. Chris Christie builds profile as he eyes 2016 presidential run . ""If you can't trust her honesty and her integrity when she tells you that this is her plan, why would you trust her honesty and integrity on anything else she tells you about what she'll do for Wisconsin or about Scott's record?"" Christie said. ""You shouldn't trust any of it."" Burke's campaign did not return a request for comment from CNN. Her team added citations to parts of her jobs plan and fired Schnurer. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Burke said last week that her jobs plan did not violate her principles. ""When you put together economic development plans, this is about bringing in the best ideas,"" she said. ""And this is not anything more than bringing good ideas to Wisconsin, to the plans on how I'm going to move Wisconsin forward. And in describing some of these ideas, similar language was used by the consultant that was used in those ideas that he incorporated in other candidates' plans."" Walker is in a tight race with his Democratic challenger. A recent poll showed Walker with a slim three-point advantage over Burke. Christie's appearance for Walker, a fellow potential contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, came the same day as first lady Michelle Obama campaigned for Burke in Milwaukee. ""She is in this for the right reasons,"" the first lady said at a rally for Burke. ""She cares about people. She doesn't care about politics.""","Chris Christie stumps for fellow Gov.

"(CNN) -- Lytro is trying to make interactive pictures happen, again. The Silicon Valley startup made a splash three years ago with its first Lytro camera, which let users refocus an image after shooting it. Now Lytro is back with a new, higher-end and more powerful camera, the $1,600 Illum. The Illum is hefty but slick-looking, with minimal buttons, a noninterchangable zoom lens and a matte-black finish. Visually, it has little in common with the original Lytro, a small rectangular box that didn't bear much resemblance to any traditional camera. Inside it uses a higher-grade version of its light-field technology to snap what the company calls ""living pictures"" -- photographs in which you can change the focus on different subjects in the frame long after you've shot them. The allure of these unique images is not having to worry about making sure a photo is in focus in the moment. The photos are also ""interactive"" for all viewers, who can tinker with the image later on a computer or mobile device, bringing one subject or an entire scene into focus with a tap or a click. The company believes that these types of interactive photos are the next evolution in photography. ""We think that if you look at how pictures work today in the world and on the Web, we're really still tied to the legacy of print,"" said Lytro CEO Jason Rosenthal. ""This will really replace digital in the way that digital has replaced film."" Better than its predecessor . Lytro was founded by Stanford graduate student Ren Ng, the brains behind turning light-field technology into a commercial product. After raising $50 million in funding, Lytro released its first product, a camera for consumers, in 2011. Its first Lytro was much-hyped but pricey at $399. While the company has been hesitant to share exact sales numbers, the lack of Lytro ""living images"" filling up your social media feeds or websites indicates the camera didn't quite take off. It was seen as a cool gadget with one clever trick up its sleeve, and was alternately praised as groundbreaking and dismissed as a gimmick. The first Lytro camera also suffered from low-quality images, a subject the Lytro team eluded by insisting that Lytro photos cannot be measured in mere megapixels. The Lytro format is an entirely new type of photograph that is measured in megarays. The original Lytro took 11-megaray photos and the Illum takes 40-megaray shots. Having four times the amount of megarays sounds cool, but what does it actually look like? Rosenthal says that if you were to export a Lytro Illum image into a traditional flat photo, it would be the equivalent of 4 to 6 megapixels. It's better, but still a long way from DSLR quality. The company says its new camera is ""professional grade"" and should appeal to full-time photographers and artists. It begins shipping in July but is available for preorders immediately. The design of the Illum includes a tilted 4-inch touchscreen inspired by the way smartphone photographers hold their phones and the old Hasselblad viewfinders, where you look down. The thick lens has a 30-250mm zoom range with a consistent f/2.0 aperture. While composing a shot, you can hit a button on top of the camera to play with depth and focus in real time on the touchscreen. There's a color overlay that shows you what parts of the scene can be brought into focus later. The guts of the camera are far more powerful than the original Lytro. The operating system is built on Android with a speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon processor inside. It has wireless capabilities, and the 1-inch optical format sensor is four times larger than the first Lytro sensor. A bold strategy . One hurdle still facing the company is that the light-field image format isn't widely supported and the images are best hosted on Lytro's site and viewed in custom Lytro mobile and desktop apps. Some social networks such as Twitter, Google+ and Pinterest have added special support for Lytro images. Facebook shows them, but the originals are hosted on Lytro's site. Gunning for the semiprofessional market is an interesting strategy for Lytro, whose original camera occupied a dying gray area in the photography industry alongside the amateur point-and-shoot. It wasn't a professional camera, and it wasn't packed inside a smartphone. Many thought a partnership with a smartphone or camera company would have been an ideal solution for Lytro. In the beginning, Ng did try to license the technology to the big optics companies, but he didn't have any luck. So he decided to make his own hardware instead. ""Transformational tech needs a transformative product to bring the full benefits,"" said Ng, who is now Lytro's executive chairman. Rosenthal also dismisses the idea of just licensing the light-field technology. He believes that's like saying Tesla in its early days was just going to be an electric battery and engine company. Instead, Lytro insists on being a consumer-focused hardware startup. This may prove a challenge in software-driven SIlicon Valley, where billion-dollar companies are built relatively cheaply on lines of code. But with a $40 million injection of new funding, an entirely new product for a different audience and a renewed push to make a different photo format catch on, Lytro is confident in its technology and ready to try again.","The camera company Lytro is back with its second product, the $1,600 Illum .

"(CNN) -- Area schools were closed Tuesday as the search for Pennsylvania trooper shooting suspect Eric Matthew Frein intensified overnight, Pennsylvania State Police said. Despite a possible sighting by law enforcement Monday afternoon, Frein still has not been found. ""A local police officer from Pocono Mountain Regional Police Department observed a man dressed in green in the woods. He lost visual contact with the man through the woods. A search of the area was conducted but no one was located,"" state police said. It has been nearly six weeks since Frein disappeared after allegedly shooting two state troopers, leaving one officer dead and another wounded. Police read excerpts of notes they say suspect left . On Friday, state police discovered blood droplets on the steps of a covered porch near the town of Cresco, Pennsylvania. But DNA testing showed the blood wasn't Frein's, police said Monday. Material found on the inside of a screen porch door at a nearby home wasn't blood at all, police said. Neither has any link to the search for Frein, according to police. On Friday, a law enforcement source speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN that there was no reason to believe that Frein was injured or that the blood was his. Frein, 31, is suspected in the September 12 ambush shooting that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove in northeast Pennsylvania. Police have not spoken about a possible motive, other than that Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. Authorities have said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack. Police: Suspect planned ambush for months . He has eluded capture despite a massive police search around Canadensis, Pennsylvania, where his family has a home. However, another recent sighting moved search efforts about 8 miles southeast -- closer to Frein's former high school. Police say they think a woman taking a walk Friday night saw Frein as well, armed with a rifle and his face dabbed with mud, in a wooded area near the eastern Pennsylvania town of Swiftwater. ""It was very alarming and creepy how he showed no reaction,"" the woman told CNN affiliate WNEP. CNN's Jason Hanna, Ann Roche, Alex Field, Shimon Prokupecz and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Frein may have been seen Monday afternoon, but a search turned up nothing, police say .

"(CNN) -- Residents of Tripoli woke up Tuesday to find that a landmark statue of a naked woman stroking a gazelle had mysteriously disappeared from the center of the Libyan capital. No one has so far claimed responsibility for removing the statue but residents and journalists suspect hardline Islamist militants who have in the past branded the nude artwork immoral and called for its removal. The bronze statue dates back to the Italian colonial era and, until Tuesday, sat in a fountain at the eponymous Gazelle Roundabout in central Tripoli near the Mediterranean. ""All that remains is part of the base, showing that the bronze statue was wrenched off its pedestal, probably by a mechanical digger,"" reported the English-language daily Libya Herald. The Culture Ministry condemned the act, saying in a statement ""the stealing of the statue is an act of vandalism and is an attempt to obliterate the trace and history of Libya's landmarks."" The Tripoli local council also issued a condemnation and called on fellow Libyans to ""protect Libyan heritage and monuments in their area."" The statue was hit by a mortar shell during heavy clashes between rival militias in August, leaving a gaping hole in the woman's side. Its removal is the latest example of friction between the powerful Islamist groups and more liberal elements of Libyan society. A video on Libyan television from February 2012 shows a small group of intellectuals and journalists holding a demonstration at the roundabout following hardline Islamists' threats to remove the statue. One image appears to show a cut in gazelle's leg, indicating an attempt to saw through the statue. Around that same time, the statue was temporarily covered up by a blue plastic tarp to hide her nudity. There was plenty of condemnation on social media, but at least one poster on Twitter who sympathizes with the ISIS terror group saw the removal as a good thing. ""Statue of Italians who brutally killed Libyans for over 20+ years is brought down today in ""#Tripoli. Libya is free,"" tweeted the user who only goes by the name ""Islam,"" later posting: ""Any Libyan who like that statue hates Libya and Islam."" Libya has been in the throes of civil unrest since the 2011 revolution and ouster of dictator Moammar Gadhafi, with rival militant factions competing for control over political and economic power and Libya's vast oil reserves. There are even two rival governments -- an Islamist-backed, self-installed government controls Tripoli, while a Western-backed government elected in June operates out of the country's east. There have been fierce deadly clashes for weeks in Benghazi after the Western-backed government and forces loyal it launched a military operation to drive out Islamist militias from the city.","A landmark statue has disappeared from a roundabout in Libya's capital, Tripoli .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- More than a week after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 went down in eastern Ukraine, Malaysian investigators have not yet been able to access the entire crash site, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday. He urged both the pro-Russia rebels and Ukraine's armed forces to cooperate so investigators can access the site fully. All 298 people aboard the plane died when it crashed on July 17. Of that number, 43 were Malaysian, including 15 crew and two infants, according to Malaysia Airlines. Nine days later, some human remains still lie scattered amid the debris. A statement from Najib's office said that since a deal was struck with the rebels on access to the crash site, a team of three Malaysian investigators has visited on three separate occasions, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Each visit lasted about three hours, and the team was not able to visit all of the very large site. The team believes that at least 30 investigators would be needed to cover the entire site, in addition to themselves, three Dutch investigators and one representative of the independent ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) allowed in so far, the statement said. ""Unfortunately, events on the ground -- including ongoing fighting between Ukrainian and separatist forces -- prevent such a large contingent of investigators being deployed,"" the statement said. Najib's words come only a day after the rebels controlling the area -- the same rebels that Ukraine and the United States accuse of downing the plane -- hinted to an international monitoring group that they've nearly had enough, even with the limited number of investigators they've let in so far. ""We were given the indication ... that their patience is almost wearing out,"" said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has had a small team touring the site for days. ""They're saying maybe another week and then they don't know what would happen."" That scenario would be unlikely to please a number of nations that say a proper investigation still hasn't begun, including Netherlands, whose officials say they're negotiating with the Ukrainian government to send 40 Dutch military police to search for more bodies. ""Malaysia's agreement with those in control of the crash site has three central elements: the transfer of the black boxes to Malaysia; the return of the human remains; and full access to the crash site for international investigators,"" Najib is quoted as saying. ""The first two conditions have been met. My priority now is to ensure the third part of the deal is honored, and that international investigators are given full and secure access to the site. This will require the cooperation of those in control of the crash site and the Ukrainian armed forces."" More coffins flown out . Another 38 coffins arrived on two planes from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and were given a somber welcome in the Dutch city of Eindhoven. This is expected to be the last transfer of coffins from Ukraine to Netherlands for the time being. The search for further remains at the crash site will continue when possible. Meantime, authorities for the first time released the identity of a victim with Dutch nationality. A team of more than 200 specialists are busy with the identification process, but officials have stressed the process could take months. A group of Dutch forensic experts was unable to reach the crash site Saturday because of safety concerns prompted by renewed fighting in the Donetsk area, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said. He said it was also too dangerous for OSCE observers to return to the site. As of Friday afternoon, 378 body bags containing remains of Flight 17 victims had been processed in Kharkiv, where discovered remains have been sent, Sergey Bochkovskiy, the head of Ukraine's State Emergency Services, told reporters there. Officials say it's unclear how many individual victims' remains are contained in the bags. Dutch citizens were 193 of the 298 people aboard the downed flight. By Friday, 198 coffins had either already arrived in Netherlands or were on their way Friday, Bochkovskiy said. On Friday, the OSCE team toured the crash site, returning to a recently discovered section of fuselage from the plane. This time -- unlike Thursday -- victims' passports and other documentation were there, Bociurkiw said. ""We can't draw any conclusions. But for sure, those were not there the last time we were there,"" he said. ""Perhaps someone placed it there. We don't know."" No Ukrainian government or international force has secured the site, raising concerns about tampering or pilfering. The OSCE team on Friday toured with a few experts from Australia and, for the first time, some forensic experts from Netherlands. Though many corpses have been recovered already, Bociurkiw said the group still has seen human remains among the debris several times this week. Parliament to vote on international police . Ukraine temporary Acting Prime Minister Volodymyr Hroisman said Saturday that access to the crash site to allow its examination by investigators and the recovery of bodies is the key issue at stake, according to the Cabinet press office. But, he said, an international police mission is needed to guard the experts on the site. For this to happen, he said, Parliament must ratify a treaty allowing the deployment. ""This document is being prepared and will soon be introduced to the Parliament. I hope it will be passed by the Parliament next week,"" he said. The next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for Thursday. It would appear that no international police will be allowed at the site before Parliament votes. Forty Dutch military policemen have arrived in Ukraine, where they will be tasked with helping to find human remains and belongings. They have not yet gone to the crash site. Najib is expected to travel to Netherlands on Wednesday and will meet with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in the Hague, his office said. The two leaders will discuss issues around securing the crash site and the process of identifying the human remains recovered from the scene so far. Najib said the three Malaysian investigators were now preparing a preliminary report based on their observations so far. Once that is complete, they plan to return to the crash site, ""if possible with a larger contingent of investigators and in more secure circumstances,"" the statement said. Conflict continues . Accusations over who was responsible for bringing down the passenger jet, which was headed from Amsterdam to Malaysia, continue to be traded by the Ukrainian government, pro-Russian rebels and officials in Moscow and Washington. MH17 was downed on July 17 by a suspected surface-to-air missile over eastern Ukraine, where groups of pro-Russian rebels are fighting Ukrainian government forces. The rebels have denied allegations from Ukraine and the West that they brought down the commercial airliner using equipment supplied by Russia. Conflict continues to roil the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine. Hundreds of vehicles crawled in heavy traffic Saturday as residents attempt to flee the center of Donetsk city heading south, following a night of intensified shelling and anti-aircraft fire on the northern outskirts of what is a stronghold for the pro-Russia rebels. According to the Twitter feed for the press office of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic on Saturday, fighting has occurred at five border check points that appear to be on the Russian side of the Ukraine-Russia border. Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency also reported fighting at five border checkpoints, naming three places on the Russia side of the border, Novoshakhtinsk, Kuybishevo and Gukovo. CNN's Ingrid Formanek reported from Donetsk and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court for now has blocked Wisconsin from implementing its voter identification law. After a federal appeals court upheld the law earlier this week, a coalition of private groups had asked the high court to intervene on an emergency basis, complaining the newly-implemented procedures could cause confusion, causing many voters to either not bother to cast a ballot or be mistakenly turned away at the polls. The order issued Thursday evening was opposed by Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. ""It is particularly troubling that absentee ballots have been sent out without any notation that proof of photo identification must be submitted,"" said Alito. The state had argued the law reduces voter fraud and promotes accurate record-keeping, saying that producing a government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license, would not unduly inconvenience most citizens. Wisconsin officials have not announced their next steps to comply with the high court's one-page order. The issue could affect the gubernatorial race between incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who backs voter ID, and his Democratic challenger Mary Burke. The Wisconsin cases are Frank v. Walker (14A376) and (14A352). Meantime in Texas, a judge struck down that state's voter ID law, saying it would disenfranchise minority voters and therefore could not be implemented. ""We are extremely pleased with today's ruling, a ruling that was compelled by the facts of this case. Following a two-week trial that included testimony from nearly 40 witnesses, Texas failed to identify a single instance of in-person voter fraud -- the purported justification for Texas's photo ID law,"" said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the nation's leading civil rights law firm and a separate entity from the NAACP. ""The Court today effectively ruled that racial discrimination simply cannot spread to the ballot box."" The office of state Attorney General Greg Abbott said in a statement it would appeal ""and urge the Fifth Circuit (federal court) to resolve this matter quickly to avoid voter confusion in the upcoming election. The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that voter ID laws are constitutional so we are confident the Texas law will be upheld on appeal."" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder lauded both the Wisconsin and Texas decisions.

"(CNN) -- Teams of investigators were out at daybreak Wednesday examining damage to NASA's Wallops Flight Facility after an unmanned rocket exploded shortly after launch on the Virginia coast, NASA spokeswoman Rachel Kraft told CNN via email. NASA is warning people in the area not to touch debris if they find any. The Antares rocket, built by NASA contractor Orbital Sciences Corp., and its Cygnus cargo spacecraft ""suffered a catastrophic failure"" shortly after liftoff Tuesday evening, the company said. The crash caused a huge fire and scattered debris over a large area. Orbital Sciences told CNN it would issue a statement on the status of the investigation later Wednesday. The cargo module was carrying 5,000 pounds of supplies and experiments meant for the International Space Station. Officials say no one was injured or killed in the explosion, but NASA says debris may be scattered around the launch area and some may have fallen into the ocean. Rocket explodes in fireball. What happened? The public is being warned to forget about grabbing up rocket debris as souvenirs. ""It had a lot of hazardous materials on board that people should not be looking for or wanting to collect souvenirs over,"" said Frank Culbertson, a former NASA astronaut and now a manager at Orbital Sciences Corp. ""If you find anything that washes ashore in the local area or came down on your farm or in your yard ... definitely do not touch it and keep people away from it."" ""There may be a possibility of debris washing up onto some of the beaches into some of the areas surrounding the island,"" Bill Wrobel, director of NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, said a news conference Tuesday. If people do find any debris, they're being urged to call NASA at 757-824-1295. NASA says teams started assessing damage to Wallops at daylight Wednesday. ""Damage was contained to kind of the south end of Wallops Island,"" Wrobel said. ""That's predominately where many of the pieces came down."" Opinion: Rockets blow up; we move on . 'You see a big fireball' The rocket lifted off at 6:22 p.m. ET, but about six seconds after launch, there was an explosion and the rocket fell to the ground, engulfed in a huge fireball. It seemed to be going perfectly when Ed Encina saw the launch brighten up the sky from his vantage point about 3 miles away. ""And then, all of a sudden, you see a big fireball,"" said Encina, a Baltimore Sun reporter. He recalled a loud boom that caused ""your feet (to) shake a little bit,"" as well as flames enveloping a roughly 100-yard area around the launchpad in a marshy area with brush. CNN iReporter Dymetria Sellers, who watched from a drawbridge because the NASA visitors station was full, recalled a ""breathtakingly beautiful"" sight when the rocket ascended, followed by mass confusion as flames lit up the early nighttime sky moments later. ""About 30 seconds later, we could hear and feel two booms reach us, and it was apparent the rocket had exploded,"" she said. Did you witness the rocket explosion? Please share your images . Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, said such a colossal fire was to be expected after the launch failure. ""It takes a lot of propellant to take a spacecraft of that size moving 25 times the speed of sound,"" Kelly told CNN, explaining how fast the rocket should have gone on its way to the space station. ""So when it fails, it's usually pretty catastrophic."" Orbital Sciences will lead the investigation into the explosion. NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration will assist. ""What we know so far is pretty much what everybody saw on the video,"" Culbertson said. ""The ascent stopped, there was some, let's say disassembly, of the first stage, and then it fell to Earth. ... We don't really have any early indications of exactly what might have failed, and we need some time to look at that."" They'll examine debris and review video of the launch and telemetry from the spacecraft. ""We have reams and reams of data that comes down from the rocket during launch,"" Culbertson said. Payload included student experiments . The cargo included crew supplies, hardware for the space station, spacewalk equipment and several experiments designed by students. No classified payloads were on board the spacecraft, said Kraft, the NASA spokeswoman. One experiment from Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart in Houston would have tested how pea shoots grow in space. The school said on its website that students, parents and teachers were shocked and disappointed by the explosion, but that it wasn't a total loss. ""The amount of learning that occurred as a result of being part of this program through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) is incredible and the students and their teachers ... should always be proud of this accomplishment,"" the school said. Also lost in the blast was a study called Drain Brain, which was designed to help learn more about blood flow in space, and an experiment called Meteor, which may have helped find previously undetected meteor showers. The cargo also included more than 1,300 pounds of food for the space station. NASA four to six months' worth of food is stashed on board, so there is no worry the crew will go hungry. Also, a Russian Progress resupply vehicle arrived at the space station Wednesday. And SpaceX is scheduled to take up supplies in December. ""The station is in great shape; the crew is in good shape,"" said Mike Suffredini, the space station's program manager. Opinion: Don't overreact to rocket explosion .

"(CNN) -- Tips led police to a Milwaukee home where they recovered a nearly 300-year-old violin worth millions that was stolen from an orchestra concertmaster, authorities said Thursday. The Stradivarius violin, known as the ""ex-Lipinski,"" was found in a suitcase in the attic of the home, police told reporters at a news conference. The violin appears to have been recovered in good condition, but officials are waiting for an expert to examine the instrument, Mark Niehaus of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra said. The violin, appraised at $5 million, was stolen on January 27 from Frank Almond, the orchestra's concertmaster -- the top first violinist. Three people have been arrested in connection with the theft but have not been formally charged, authorities said. Police Chief Edward Flynn described the three as a 36-year-old man, a 41-year-man and a 32-year-old woman, all from Milwaukee. Stefan Hersh, the man who originally authenticated the instrument for the orchestra, told CNN that law enforcement contacted him to identify the violin. The orchestra offered a $100,000 reward for the safe return of the instrument. ""We're confident the subjects in custody are the subjects responsible for this,"" said G.B. Jones, acting special agent in charge with the FBI in Milwaukee. 3 arrested in Stradivarius theft in Wisconsin . Almond was walking to his car after a performance when an assailant used a stun gun on him, causing him to drop the instrument.

Almond has not yet been reunited with the instrument, according to Hersh. Stradivari was born in 1644. He set up shop in Cremona, Italy, where he made violins, harps, guitars, violas and cellos. Before his death in 1737, Stradivari is thought to have made more than 1,100 instruments -- of which some 650 remain today. He is the world's most celebrated violin maker.","NEW: Tips lead authorities to the home where the violin was recovered, police said .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Supreme Court justices peppered attorneys with questions Tuesday over whether an Arkansas inmate should be allowed to grow a beard as part of his religious faith. Gregory Holt, also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad, is a Muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the high court. He cited rights under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. He wants to grow the beard as part of his religious faith and his attorneys claim he had offered to keep it to a ""half-inch"" as part of what Holt called a ""compromise."" In their response, Arkansas corrections officials cited security concerns in their refusal to accommodate. Justices to debate prisoner's religious right to grow a beard . According to the state of Arkansas, current policy allows only a ""neatly trimmed mustache"" and inmate beards could pose a security risk to guards and the public: Prisoners who escape could shave their facial hair, altering their appearance. And weapons and other contraband could be hidden in heavy beards or inside their cheeks, covered by facial hair. Justice Samuel Alito was skeptical: ""As far as searching a beard is concerned: Why can't the prison just give the inmate a comb and say comb your beard? And if there's anything in there -- if there's a SIM card in there or a revolver or anything else you think can be hidden in a half-inch beard, a tiny revolver -- it'll fall out."" Chief Justice John Roberts addressed the issue of how to define ""neatly trimmed."" ""One of the difficult issues in a case like this is where to draw the line,"" Roberts said, addressing Holt's lawyer. ""And you just say: 'Well, we want to draw the line at a half-inch because that lets us win.' And the next day someone's going to be here with 1 inch. And then 2 inches. Administrative Directive 98-04.D of the Arkansas Department of Correction permits beards only for those ""with a diagnosed dermatological problem."" But in his self-initiated plea to the justices, Holt complained that he and fellow Muslims were forced ""to either obey their religious beliefs and face disciplinary action on the one hand, or violate those beliefs in order to acquiesce"" to the facial hair policy. Read Holt's original handwritten petition to the Supreme Court (PDF) He cited the Hadith -- literary traditions and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed -- which says, ""Allah's Messenger said, 'Cut the mustaches short and leave the beard (as it is).' "" Holt said he offered to keep his beard to a half-inch as a ""compromise,"" but that was rejected. Forty states and the federal correctional system allow beards of varying lengths, say his attorneys. Holt is housed at the Varner Supermax, a 468-bed, ultra-maximum security section of the correctional facility in Grady, Arkansas, near Pine Bluff. Officials point to Inmate 129-616's self-admission as a ""Yemen-trained Muslim fundamentalist"" with a violent criminal past. He had been indicted by a federal grand jury for threatening to harm then-President George W. Bush's two daughters. A few years later, he was convicted in state court and sentenced to life in prison for breaking into the home of his ex-girlfriend and severely wounding her, slitting her throat and stabbing her in the chest. Law enforcement officials say he threatened to wage ""jihad"" against anyone who helped convict him, both at trial and later behind bars. But Holt's lawyers say his criminal history is not at issue, but rather the state's continued restrictive policies. ""What they really seek is absolute deference to anything they say just because they say it,"" attorney Douglas Laycock told the justices at the start of the one-hour argument. ""There may be deference to prison officials, but there must be concrete limits to that deference."" Justice Antonin Scalia questioned Holt's claim of a compromise in growing a trimmed beard. ""Let's assume in the religion that requires polygamy -- could I say to the prison: 'I won't have three wives, just let me have two wives.' I mean, you're still violating his religion, it seems to me, if he allows his beard to be clipped to one-half inch, isn't he?"" When Laycock said the inmate should not be punished for being ""reasonable"" in his request, Scalia shot back, ""Religious beliefs aren't reasonable."" State leaders had a simple message for the courts: Allow us room to decide which restrictions work best within each institution's unique circumstances. David Curran, representing the state attorney general's office, said ""common sense"" was applied in a reasonable way when the no-beards policy was enacted. But that brought tough questions from the bench. ""You have no comparable rule about hair on one's head, where it seems more could be hidden than in the beard,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, ""where you hide something in a beard and it might drop out."" And Justice Stephen Breyer: ""There's no example, not a single example in any state, that allows beard policies where somebody did hide something in his beard,"" a point the state conceded. Arkansas also argued growing facial hair could make it hard to identify inmates -- either behind bars or if they escape. Alito again: ""Why is that so? Are you saying that somebody with or without a half-inch beard -- that's a bigger difference than somebody who has longish hair, versus the same person with a shaved head?"" The Obama administration is backing Holt. Some legal analysts say the justices have traditionally been deferential to the security judgments of prison officers. The beard case is one of three high-profile disputes over religion that will be heard by the justices in coming weeks. One involves the ability of Americans born in the holy city of Jerusalem to list ""Israel"" or ""Palestine"" as their country of birth on U.S. passports. Another is a workplace discrimination claim filed by a female Muslim woman from Tulsa who wears a hijab. She sued the clothing chain after a job was offered then rescinded -- she claims because of her headscarf. And the court will hear arguments over whether local governments can impose stricter regulations on temporary church signs than on other noncommercial displays, such as lost-dog posters and political campaign banners, typically displayed along streets in the weeks before an election. Holt is being defended in court by the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty, the same nonprofit group that backed two Christian families in a separate high court challenge earlier this year. At issue there was whether a federal law permitted closely held family-owned corporations the discretion to deny contraception coverage in employer-funded insurance plans. The conservative court dealt a setback to the White House and Obamacare supporters in the so-called Hobby Lobby dispute, saying those with ""sincerely held"" religious beliefs had a limited right to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace. The Beckett Fund noted that groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Anti-Defamation League, along with Catholic bishops, are now backing Holt. The current Arkansas dispute is Holt v. Hobbs (13-6827).","Gregory Holt wants to grow beard as part of his religious faith .

"(CNN) -- New York City agreed on Wednesday to pay nearly $18 million to settle the civil rights claims of thousands of people arrested during the 2004 Republican National Convention that nominated George W. Bush for a second presidential term. New York police engaged in mass arrests of more than 1,800 protesters, bystanders, legal observers and journalists during the event. Michael Schiller, a documentary maker working for HBO, said he was caught in police netting and arrested while attempting to film protesters from a sidewalk in Lower Manhattan. ""Police rolled out orange nets and I was caught in one of those nets and I ended up spending 28 hours in a temporary jail they created on the West Side Highway in an old bus depot,"" Schiller said, adding that he was detained in overcrowded and dirty conditions. ""The ground was covered in oil and stuff that comes out of buses,"" Schiller said, ""There wasn't enough seating. Men and women were separated in different pens. Everyone was covered in this filthy black. People had abrasions and lesions from their skin touching the oil."" The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the City of New York in October 2004 on behalf of Schiller and others, claiming their constitutional rights had been violated. Schiller represents one of more than 430 people who brought lawsuits against the city and the police. Another 1,200 were included in a class-action lawsuit. According to the city law department, New York and the New York City Police Department defended itself against the lawsuits, maintaining that the conduct of the police had been constitutional and that its goal was keep order and prevent the protests from spiraling. In October 2012, a federal District Court ruled that the Fulton Street mass arrests were unconstitutional and urged for a settlement of the remaining cases. The result was Wednesday's agreement. Approved by U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, the settlement includes $10.3 million for all individuals arrested during the RNC, and $7.6 million for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, according to a press release by the Law Department. Christopher Dunn, NYCLU associate legal director and Schiller's lawyer, said there is a substantial range of individual settlement rewards. ""They vary depending on how long people were in detention, the conditions they were in, and the outcome of their criminal cases,"" Dunn said. Schiller did not comment when asked about his personal settlement. The average payout per plaintiff is about $6,400, according to a news release by the Law Department. ""The quantity of money that the city has spent on this is outrageous in the sense that this is money that could go to New York City public schools or New York City hospitals that are closing left and right and New York City fire departments,"" Schiller said. Schiller produced a documentary, ""The After Party,"" about his case. ""I think that in some ways it really is a victory for democracy and freedom of speech and freedom of the press,"" Schiller said. Is free speech on mute during the conventions?","1,800 protesters were arrested in New York during 2004 Republican National Convention .

"Washington (CNN) -- The super PAC backed by the Koch brothers is making its final push in Kansas on Thursday with a seven figure ad buy urging voters to keep independent candidate Greg Orman out of the Senate. Orman has remained tight-lipped on which party he would caucus with if elected, but the Koch-backed super PAC is funneling more than $1.1 million into Kansas airwaves to make sure Orman doesn't get the chance to cast the deciding vote for Senate control. Freedom Partners Action Fund, the sole super PAC in the Koch brothers' vast network of political groups, is launching two TV ads in Kansas that link Orman to President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. The ads will run through Election Day. ""The future of Kansas, of our country could depend on you,"" the narrator says in one ad. ""Kansas can stop Harry Reid and Barack Obama's failed policies. How? Don't vote for Greg Orman."" Recent polls show Orman is neck-and-neck with incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Roberts in one of the most watched Senate races this cycle. And after Democrats pulled their candidate to boost Orman's chances of unseating Roberts, Republicans have made every attempt to paint Orman as a Democrat-in-disguise. It's a strategy the Koch-backed group has also adopted, dropping $6.5 million of ads in six other battleground Senate races to paint a vote for Democratic Senate candidates as a vote for Obama. The pair of Kansas ads might be the group's final push, but it's not their first. The super PAC threw $500,000 worth of TV time last month with the same strategy of linking Orman to Obama. Orman and Roberts are tied at 46% of support, according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday. A CNN/ORC poll earlier this month also judged the race a statistical tie, with Roberts leading by just one point with 49%. Orman is just one of the candidates this year who could shake things up in the Senate. In South Dakota, former Sen. and now-Independent Larry Pressler is a top contender in a competitive three-man race -- and there's also a chance he could caucus with Democrats. And in North Carolina, a separate Koch-backed group is on the airwaves with an ad supporting libertarian candidate Sean Haugh in a ploy clearly aimed at siphoning liberal votes away from Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. ""[Sean Haugh] supports our progressive values. Pro-legalization, pro-environment. More weed, less war,"" a young female narrator says in the ad. An independent candidate polling at about 3% in Georgia could also push the race to a runoff in January if neither the Democrat or Republicans crack the 50% vote threshold.","Koch-backed super PAC is pushing two TV ads worth over $1.1 million to defeat Greg Orman .

"Washington (CNN) -- Targeted political advertising is heading to a new but very familiar frontier -- YouTube. If you live in Syracuse or Long Island, New York, and go to the popular video sharing site in the next two weeks to find a news clip or view a favorite home decorating show, the first thing that will pop up on your screen will be a political ad. For the first time a political campaign is targeting voters by ZIP code on YouTube. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce added this new advertising tool to the broadcast media strategy it recently launched focused on a number of House and Senate races, one of the earliest and biggest efforts the pro-business lobby has unveiled to date. In seven New York congressional districts where the Chamber is running paid television ads, it added a new layer -- running those TV ads on YouTube. ""The stakes of this election are huge for the business community and we recognize as we roll out our different phases of the campaigns, we're going to use broadcast but we're also going to use YouTube,"" said Scott Reed, senior political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""We're going to use the Internet to reinforce and repeat and repeat and repeat the messages of how important it is to have a growing economy and candidates that are pro-growth."" Anyone who visits YouTube in the next two weeks -- and whose IP address or computer location falls within any of the ZIP codes of the specific New York districts -- will see the Chamber's ad before seeing a video clip. The program, called ""TrueView"" allows the user five seconds to ""opt out,"" or stop playing the political ad. And the Chamber only pays for the ads that people watch. Corporate advertisers have been using so-called ""pre-roll ads"" on websites to sell toothpaste or preview a movie coming to theaters soon. But the technology to target ads to specific ZIP codes was just released in March by Google, which owns YouTube, according to Rob Saliterman, who leads Google's advertising sales to political campaigns and issue advocacy groups. The Obama campaign pioneered targeting voters online and on mobile devices in 2008, and both parties now feature online outreach components to get out their messages. But this effort is the first instance of a campaign turning to YouTube to aim its political pitch at specific ZIP codes. Reed calls combining the online ads with TV a ""one-two punch."" The effort includes a variety of ads, which the Chamber is using to gauge how voters respond to different messages online. Three positive ads promote the pro-business credentials of GOP freshman Reps. Ann Marie Buerkle, Chris Gibson, and Nan Hayworth. Three negative ads, which the Chamber calls ""contrast"" ads, criticize Democratic Reps. Louise Slaughter, Kathy Hochul and Bill Owens for supporting ""Obamacare"" and argue they oppose pro-growth policies. One ad combines criticism of Democratic incumbent Rep. Tim Bishop with a plug for his GOP challenger Randy Altschuler. A Nielson study commissioned by Google last year found that viewers who see advertising across multiple platforms are more likely to retain the message. The Chamber's strategy demonstrates it believes the same successful experience businesses found with online ads could translate into the political arena. Dan Maffei, who is challenging Buerkle to retake the central New York seat she knocked him out of in 2010, isn't convinced that this kind of micro-targeting will make a big difference in the fall election. ""It doesn't surprise me that big money is going to come in on my opponent Anne Marie Buerkle's side because she supports these big business things that are good for them, but it's not at all connecting to our local chamber of commerce,"" Maffei told CNN. Maffei said his local Syracuse chamber didn't contribute to the ad or sign off on the effort and said the national business lobby's message doesn't mesh with local concerns. ""It's almost like it's just coming in from above with a message that's generic in an attempt to prop her up in a district where she doesn't have that kind of support, even from small businesses,"" he said. The Chamber's television campaign is a multimillion-dollar effort, but Reed declined to say how much specifically the chamber is spending on the YouTube component. One expert familiar with online advertising says the average cost of a pre-roll ad is roughly 10 to 15 cents per view. Over the course of two weeks, potentially thousands of users could view each of the ads in the seven districts. Saliterman stressed that the data collected on the ads does not contain any personally identifiable information, but Google can pull together some aggregate data on age and gender and interest categories based on who watches the ads on YouTube. Reed calls the data it will get from the YouTube after the two-week run ""survey research."" ""We're able to go in and look at how long people are on the ads, if they like the ads and stay until the end of the ad, if they stay on more for a positive ad or a contrast ad,"" Reed said, adding, ""this is another tool to help us decide if our ads are penetrating and working and getting to the voters."" It's no surprise that YouTube is the place to start this type of targeted political outreach. More than 2 billion videos are streamed each day on its website and approximately 100 million unique users in the United States click on the site every month, according to YouTube's own statistics. Earlier this year, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee paid to run an ad on You Tube hitting the House Republican's budget proposal and featuring actor Martin Sheen. It targeted users who typed any search for ""Medicare."" But the Chamber's move to focus resources to reach voters in specific congressional districts could prove to be a more effective use of money. Television ads are pricey and candidates are often forced to buy time in markets that broadcast outside their particular district's borders. With people increasingly turning to mobile devices to get news or view entertainment programming on their own schedules, fewer people are watching television programs when they actually air. A study in Ohio last fall conducted by Targeted Victory, a group working with Republican pollsters, found that 40% of likely voters were ""going off the grid"" and had not watched live television within the previous week. The Chamber's move is a reflection of the changing environment that can make getting political messages out a greater challenge. ""We know in today's fractured media world, people get their messages from many different places, and the Internet is becoming the top place,"" Reed noted. ""Technology is very important to reaching voters, and clearly the Obama campaign showed that and we (Democrats) used Twitter and Facebook and all that to get our message out,"" Maffei said. But the Democratic candidate said he believes Buerkle's constituents will focus on the GOP congresswoman's record this fall more than the message in the 30-second online ad. ""You have to talk to voters,"" Maffei said. ""You can't just spoon-feed them."" CNN.s Dana Bash contributed to this report.","For the first time a political campaign is targeting voters by ZIP code on YouTube .

"(CNN) -- For something that surrounds us so completely, bookending our lives, modern Americans can be surprisingly shy about death. Yes, we talk about ""deaths"" -- heinous deaths, tragic deaths, celebrity deaths, untimely deaths. But when it comes to death itself, many of us would rather use the broom of wishful thinking to sweep it away, leaving death to sit in some dark corner of our minds. Woody Allen best summed up that sentiment when he said, ""I don't want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve immortality through not dying."" For much of human history, religious rituals forced believers regularly to confront our ultimate fate. On Rosh Hashanah, according to Jewish tradition, God decides who will live or die during the next year. The Buddha urged monks to meditate on the decay of corpses. Millions of Catholics pray each week for Christ to come again and resurrect the dead. But this country is changing rapidly, and at the very time modern medicine puts life-or-death decisions in our hands, organized religion has faded from the lives of many Americans. As the surgeon and writer Atul Gawande noted in The New York Times recently, our medical system, powerful as it may be, is ill-equipped to step into the breach and answer crucial questions such as, ""What is a good death?""

"Washington (CNN) -- Bernie Sanders is headed back to Iowa and New Hampshire for a handful of events that are sure to stoke more presidential speculation in the independent senator. Sanders, according to his spokesman, will hold three events in the Hawkeye State this weekend, followed by one event in New Hampshire later in the week. The Vermont senator will headline an Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement town hall meeting in Davenport, Iowa on Saturday. On Sunday, Sanders will headline the Johnson County Democratic Party barbecue in Iowa City and keynote an Iowa Citizens Action Network meeting in Coralville. Later in the week, on October 10, Sanders will hold a town hall meeting at the University of New Hampshire with, according to his office, ""students and community members"" from the university. These events come less than a month after Sanders held a three-event tour of Iowa, where the senator spoke to audiences in Des Moines, Dubuque and Iowa City. ""We need a political revolution in this country,"" Sanders said in Dubuque. ""Politics is terribly important, and what happens in Washington and state capitals is also enormously important."" Sanders has been open with the fact that he is considering a run at the presidency, but has not committed to the race and has been reluctant to openly take on Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democrat's nomination in 2016. In an interview with CNN last month, Sanders broke with that reluctance and challenged Clinton to talk about campaign finance reform, public funding of elections and other liberal issues. ""Now is Hillary Clinton going to say that,"" the senator asked after talking about his platform.","Bernie Sanders is stoking more political speculation with visits to Iowa, New Hampshire .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie defended his verbal beat down of a heckler from earlier this week, saying he's not the kind of person to sit back and let people ""be rude."" ""I don't look forward to doing that stuff but I won't shrink away from it either,"" the Republican told reporters Thursday in New Mexico. ""So, it's just another day at the ranch -- Rancho Christie."" Christie was in the Southwest campaigning for Gov. Susana Martinez as part of his 19-state, five-day blitz as head of the Republican Governors Association. The governor, known for his aggressive style when met with confrontation, frequently warns audiences at his town halls that if they try to mess with him, he's going to fight back. ""If someone is going to stand up and I ignore them for a while and then they continue to be rude and talk over me, and block other people, well then I'm going to engage,"" he said Thursday. ""And that's what the people of New Jersey, and I think a lot of people in this country, have come to expect from me."" Chris Christie on possible Ebola lawsuit: 'Whatever' The heckler, Jim Keady, told CNN on Thursday he was trying to bring attention to what he described as Christie's failed handling of Superstorm Sandy recovery funds. ""Having done activism in the past, I know that one of the things that really pushed elected officials to dig into issues that they haven't wanted to dig into ... is to do things like this,"" he said. While Christie's response was well-received by some, Democrats have pounced on the exchange and are molding it into their wider message that Christie is a bully. Christie's temper could be a liability on the campaign trail, Democratic strategist David Axelrod said Thursday on MSNBC, adding that ""every day is filled with aggravations and provocations, and if that's the way he's going to react, he has no future in this."" ""I think he thinks that this kind of 'Sopranos' approach to politics marks him as a strong leader,"" he continued.

""I would like to take this opportunity to offer fellow police officers, soldiers and citizens my sincerest apology over the controversial e-mail I authored,"" Barrett said on CNN. ""I am not a racist. I did not intend any racial bigotry, harm or prejudice in my words. I sincerely apologize that these words have been received as such. I truly apologize to all."" Barrett was suspended from his military duties as captain in the Army National Guard and placed on administrative leave from the Boston Police Department pending the outcome of a termination hearing.  Watch Barrett apologize » . Barrett said he was moved to write the note because he felt The Boston Globe column about the Gates incident to which he was responding ""seemed like it was biased. ""It did not show the roles and duties of a police officer and how dangerous it already is without having a debate about people getting in a police officer's face, which should never happen at all."" Asked what led him to choose to use such language, he said, ""I don't know. I couldn't tell you. I have no idea."" He added, in response to a question, that he had never used such language before. In a news conference Thursday morning, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis denounced the e-mail. ""We have a relationship to maintain with the community,"" he said. ""Police officers certainly have First Amendment rights, but they can't cross the line. I believe this crosses the line.""  Watch Davis say Barrett will be held accountable » . Davis also said he spoke Wednesday with Gates, whom he described as ""gracious and incredibly thankful that we took action."" In his fiery e-mail, which he sent to some fellow Guard members as well as the newspaper, Barrett vented about a July 22 Globe column about  Gates' arrest. The African-American scholar was arrested July 16 and accused of disorderly conduct after police responded to a report of a possible break-in at his Cambridge home. The charge was later dropped, but the incident sparked a debate about  racial profiling and police procedures. President Obama stepped into the debate and drew criticism by saying the Cambridge police acted ""stupidly."" Obama, who later said he spoke without knowing all the facts, tried to calm the debate, meeting Thursday with Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt. James Crowley, for a beer at the White House. ""At this point, I am hopeful that we can all move on, and that this experience will prove an occasion for education, not recrimination,"" Gates said afterward in a written statement. ""I know that Sergeant Crowley shares this goal."" ""What you had today was two gentlemen agree to disagree on a particular issue,"" Crowley told reporters afterward. ""I don't think we spent too much time dwelling on the past; we spent a lot of time discussing the future."" Globe columnist Yvonne Abraham, who wrote the editorial that sparked Barrett's e-mail, supported Gates' actions, asking readers, ""Would you stand for this kind of treatment, in your own home, by a police officer who by now clearly has no right to be there?""  Watch Blogger Bunch: Is race discussion possible? » . In Barrett's e-mail, which was posted on a Boston television station's Web site, he declared that if he had ""been the officer he verbally assaulted like a banana-eating jungle monkey, I would have sprayed him in the face with OC (oleorosin capsicum, or pepper spray) deserving of his belligerent non-compliance."" Barrett used the ""jungle monkey"" phrase four times, three times referring to Gates and once referring to Abraham's writing as ""jungle monkey gibberish."" He also declared that he was ""not a racist but I am prejudice [sic] towards people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they say is freedom but it is merely attention because you do not get enough of it in your little fear-dwelling circle of on-the-bandwagon followers."" According to a statement from  Boston police, Davis took action immediately on learning of Barrett's remarks, stripping the officer of his gun and his badge. Barrett's prior arrests and field investigations will be looked at for indications of racial bias, Davis said. The department will also delve deeper into the officers who received or viewed the e-mail.","Justin Barrett apologizes for e-mail about Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.

"(CNN) -- A month before Delvin Barnes grabbed a woman off a street in Philadelphia, he hit a teen with a shovel in Virginia and stuffed her into the trunk of a car, authorities say. Barnes, 37, was arrested Wednesday after police tracked him down using his car's GPS device. The arrest followed his alleged kidnapping of a nurse in Philadelphia. He was detained about 20 miles southwest of Baltimore. But before he appears in court for the alleged Philadelphia abduction, he made a detour to Virginia to face charges in another alleged kidnapping. Maryland extradited him to Virginia, where he was booked and processed Thursday night. A month apart, but similar . Like in Philadelphia, the abduction in Virginia was brazen. The kidnappings were a month apart and 275 miles away from each other, but they have some similarities. Both women were younger than the alleged kidnapper: the one in Virginia was 16, and the latest victim, Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, was 22. Police say the teen was sexually abused. CNN does not name victims of sexual abuse. Though police did not release many details of the Virginia incident, authorities say the victims didn't know the suspect. In both cases, their attacker held them for a few days. Virginia teen held for two days . In Virginia, a family's nightmare started when the 16-year-old went missing. Relatives called the Charles City County Sheriff's Office on October 1. The victim told police she was hit in the head with a shovel and stuffed into the trunk of a car, according to Capt. Jayson Crawley. She was taken to the home of the suspect's parents in Charles City County, where she was sexually abused, authorities said. While there, the suspect showed the teen pictures of other girls he said he had abducted, authorities said. Two days later, the suspect allegedly brought the then-naked girl into the backyard, poured bleach and gasoline on her, burned her clothes and dug a hole. When he was briefly distracted, the girl fled into the woods. Two miles away, she stumbled onto a business, and employees brought her inside. Barnes is charged with abduction, forcible rape and malicious wounding with a chemical, among other charges. ""I just want to kill him -- just want to kill him,"" the girl's mother told CNN affiliate WWBT. The mother says Barnes allegedly told her daughter that he was going to kill her. After all that her daughter suffered, the mother said, she changed and didn't look like herself. ""I can forgive him, but could never forget,"" the mother told WWBT. Man allegedly raped, burned girl in Virginia . Philadelphia woman abducted near home . Freeland-Gaither was abducted Sunday night after she got off a bus in Philadelphia's Germantown-Penn Knox area. As she walked the few blocks to her home, the suspect's car passed her and quickly parked. A man then got out and met Freeland-Gaither at an intersection, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson said. Then her abductor pounced. Surveillance video captured the entire incident. It shows Freeland-Gaither forcibly led away to a car after a brief tussle on the ground. During the struggle, her glasses and cell phone fell to the road. She kept fighting -- even breaking a passenger side window -- but the car sped away. ""I've been on the job 46 years, (and this is the) first time I've ever seen a kidnapping on videotape. (It) really was horrific to watch it unfold,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Philadelphia police Detective James Sloan called a witness to the abduction, Dwayne Fletcher, ""a hero"" for alerting police. ""If it wasn't for him, I don't think we would have had the same outcome,"" Sloan said. Barnes admitted to the abduction, according to a criminal complaint. ""I'm glad they got him,"" his former father-in-law, Anthony Meyers, told CNN affiliate, KTRK. ""It's the kind of person he is. He's pure evil. Pure evil."" Suspect left a trail . In Freeland-Gaither's case, the abductor left behind a string of clues. A day after the kidnapping, the suspect allegedly used her ATM card at a machine in Aberdeen, Maryland. The same day, he allegedly used her card to make a purchase at a convenience store. Police released surveillance video of both transactions. A car dealer identified Barnes from the videos and alerted authorities that he had placed a GPS device in the suspect's car because of concerns about his bad credit, authorities said. The GPS device in the suspect's car is used to alert customers when they're behind on payments and also allows dealers to track down the vehicle and stop it, said PassTime USA CEO Stan Schwartz, the head of the company that made the unit. Barnes was told the device was in the car, Schwartz said. Police found the car in Jessup, Maryland, where they rescued Freeland-Gaither on Wednesday night. She was briefly hospitalized and released Thursday, and then reunited with her family after a harrowing three days. ""She had injuries, but nothing life-threatening, fortunately,"" Ramsey said. Jail official: Barnes is on suicide watch . As for Barnes, he now sits at the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George, Virginia, just over the James River from Charles City County. Medical professionals have assessed Barnes and put him on suicide watch based on his statements, Lt. Laura Gray said. Members of the public and investigators are not allowed to speak with him while he's on suicide watch. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Jean Casarez and Lawrence Crook III contributed to this report.","NEW: The Virginia victim's mother on the suspect: 'I just want to kill him'

"(CNN)  -- Senegal on Saturday unveiled a colossal statue during a lavish ceremony amid reports of criticism over the monument's construction at a time when the western African nation is struggling financially. The 164-foot structure -- about a foot taller than the Statue of Liberty -- shows the figures of a man, a woman and a child, arms outstretched, facing the Atlantic Ocean. President Abdoulaye Wade says the statue, which he designed, is a monument to Africa's renaissance. Critics say the opulent copper structure is merely the product of the president's own self-indulgent vision and poor governance. And though it dominates the skyline of Senegal's capital, Dakar, the monument falls far short of the president's claim that it is the world's largest. Several other statues are listed by multiple sources to be taller, including China's Spring Temple Buddha, which stands just under 420 feet. Opposition group Benno Siggil Senegal called on the Senegalese people to ""refuse to associate themselves with a fraudulent scheme designed to satisfy the fantasies of Abdoulaye Wade and to lay the foundations of dynastic reign of Wade on our country,"" according to the African Press Agency. A spokeswoman for the president sought to downplay criticism Saturday, saying the statue -- valued at roughly $20 million -- was made possible by a land deal between Wade and North Korea, and that proceeds from the monument will benefit Senegalese children. The statue is ""an affirmation to be proud of Africa -- to be proud to be black,"" said spokeswoman Gia Abrassart. Other dignitaries in attendance at Saturday's ceremony, which coincided with the 50th anniversary of Senegal's independence, echoed that message. ""This renaissance statue is a powerful idea from a powerful mind,"" said the Rev. Jesse Jackson in remarks to the crowd of hundreds waving flags at the foot of the lighted monument. ""This is dedicated to the journey of our ancestors, enslaved but not slaves."" Malawi President Bingu Wa Mutharika praised Wade for constructing a monument that represents Africa. ""This monument does not belong to Senegal,"" he said. ""It belongs to the African people wherever we are."" North Korea, which made the statue's construction possible, also sent Wade a congratulatory message, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. In exchange for the money to build the statue, North Korea received a piece of Senegalese land, Abrassart said. The message from top North Korean official Kim Yong Nam ""expressed belief that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries would grow stronger in various fields in the future, too,"" according to KCNA. CNN's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","Monument to African Renaissance, at 164 feet, is 1 foot taller than Statue of Liberty .

"(CNN) -- The ice moves inexorably ashore, crackling as it goes like thousands of windows breaking. In minutes, it's moved from the shoreline of a Minnesota lake to the walls of homes along the lake. ""It was just pushing and breaking and pushing and breaking,"" Darla Johnson, who made a video of Saturday's ""ice tsunami"" on Mille Lacs Lake, told CNN affiliate WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. Johnson's video had more than 275,000 views on YouTube by Monday morning. And once you watch it, you can't stop. It's like a sci-fi movie, and there's certainly science involved. Christopher Tetrault, a conservation officer for the area with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, said the weather event works like this: Strong winds blow heavy chunks of ice out in the lake toward the shore. Those chunks heave up bits of lighter, melting ice closer to shore up on the land. The more the wind blows, the more ice comes onto land. ""It basically has the same mechanism of an iceberg,"" said Todd Borek, a CNN meteorologist. ""Winds, but more so ocean currents, allow icebergs to drift. Same premise: A chunk of ice (relatively shallow) was pushed by a strong, sustained wind. The momentum of the ice sheet overcame the friction of the land."" Tetrault said the ice came about 60 feet to 80 feet inland Saturday, getting as high as 30 feet in some places. The ice mass covered up about 2.5 miles of shoreline, he said. At least one home had 2 to 3 feet of ice spill through its patio glass doors, and some boathouses along the lake were destroyed, he said. It was something Tetrault, who's only been stationed on Mille Lacs Lake for a few months, hadn't seen before. But longtime locals told him they couldn't remember anything similar since the 1950s. The same phenomenon was seen Friday on Dauphin Lake in Manitoba, about 75 miles northwest of Winnipeg, where a wall of ice up to 30 feet high destroyed six homes and damaged 14 others, according to a report from the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. ""This is worse than a flood, because with a flood, the water just goes through and it's finished. With this, there's still so much ice out on the lake that if the wind picks up again, it could start all over,"" homeowner Elaine Davis told the CBC. ""You know you've got cement, concrete blocks and steel, and the ice goes through it like it's just a toothpick,"" Dennis Stykalo, who also lost a home to the ice, told the CBC. ""It just shows the power. There is nothing you can do; you just get out of the way and just watch."" In Minnesota on Monday, people were watching the ice there melt, a steady rain helping the process, Tetrault said. Temperatures on Tuesday expected to be in the 80s or higher were also expected to help, both with the ice onshore and the larger sheet now 200 to 300 yards out into the lake, he said. Still, that ice mass was about 16 inches thick Monday, and the weather can change quickly in Minnesota. ""It's not as significant as it was,"" Tetrault said, ""but you never know with what Mother Nature does.""","Strong winds push melting ice onto lakeshore in Minnesota .

"(CNN) -- An ""unusual"" uptick in the size and scale of Russian aircraft flying throughout European airspace in recent days has raised alarm bells for NATO officials that come amid other provocations already rattling the West. Multiple groups of Russian military bomber and tanker aircraft, flying under the guise of military maneuvers, were detected and monitored over sections of the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Black Sea on Tuesday and Wednesday. Those flights represented an ""unusual level of air activity over European airspace,"" according to a press release from NATO. Adding to the concern -- none of the Russian aircraft filed customary flight plans or maintained radio contact with civilian aviation authorities or used any of their onboard transponders. ""This poses a potential risk to civil aviation as civilian air traffic control cannot detect these aircraft or ensure there is no interference with civilian air traffic,"" NATO said in its release. That concern was echoed by a U.S. official speaking with CNN who noted that none of any recent interactions between U.S. and Russian aircraft have proved problematic to this point. NATO said that in a 24-hour period ending late Wednesday, there were more than 19 instances of Russian aircraft in European airspace. According to NATO, Norwegian F-16s were scrambled and intercepted eight Russian aircraft flying over the North Sea. While some of the aircraft turned back toward Russia, two Tu-95 Bear H Russian bombers continued their flight, and were identified and intercepted by F-16s from Portugal. British fighters were also scrambled in response as the two Russian planes continued their flight westward over the Atlantic Ocean. NATO said the two Russian planes subsequently resumed a flight path back toward Russia but said those two planes were still airborne at the time of the press release. April: Dutch fighter jets intercept 2 Russian bombers in their airspace . A NATO official tells CNN the alliance believes the recent flights are a possible prelude to unannounced Russian air exercises. But while officials have noted a near-constant pattern of Russian military flights throughout NATO airspace over the past weeks, officials observed there has been little provocative behavior -- like buzzing or rollovers -- by Russian pilots in their encounters with NATO aircraft. The latest incidents also come at a time when international calls for Russia to de-escalate some of its actions beyond its borders do not appear to be taking hold. September: Russian planes intercepted near U.S., Canadian airspace . Russia's continued support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, along with plans to recognize a controversial election by the rebels next month are likely to keep the sanctions by the EU and the United States in place against Russia for the time being.

"(CNN) -- One day, Kari Ianuale had had enough. The Nazareth, Pennsylvania, resident was embarrassed to discover that her size 24 pants no longer fit. ""I refused to go up yet another size,"" she said. In July 2011, Ianuale officially began her weight loss journey, and what a journey it has been: In just over three years, she has lost a staggering amount of weight. ""People are floored when they see me,"" Ianuale said. ""They all say I don't even look like the same person."" At her heaviest, Ianuale weighed 301 pounds. At 5-foot-10, that made her body mass index 43 -- clinically, extremely obese. Today, she weighs a healthy 156 pounds. ""I was embarrassed by the way I looked,"" she admitted. ""When my husband introduced me to people I felt bad because I wasn't that pretty or thin of a wife, even though he loves me for who I am and didn't care what I looked like. ""I always thought people were judging me, especially when I would walk into places."" So how did she lose 145 pounds? And would her secrets work for you? Secret #1: Cut your portion sizes . She started by cutting back on her portion sizes. ""I always used to eat until I was feeling uncomfortably full,"" she said. ""I just lessened my portions to normal consumption,"" paying attention to labels but not counting calories. Secret #2: Start slowly, then build . She didn't go to the gym at first; she started at home on the exercise bike and elliptical. She started working out 20 to 30 minutes, six days a week. ""I was losing 20 pounds a month in the beginning,"" she said. ""As I had less and less to lose, it got harder."" So she upped her game. She signed up for a local gym and began strength training. ""My goal was to lose half,"" said Ianuale. ""I almost made it there. So now it's basically maintaining. I'll go up or down a few. I've put on a lot of muscle weightlifting at the gym."" She plans to stay around 155 to 160 pounds. Secret #3: Be consistent . Today Ianuale goes to the gym six days a week. She runs between 3 and 4 miles a night and does 30 to 40 minutes of weight training. ""I do upper body (work), then the next night, lower body."" Her husband, Nino, was persuaded to join her at the gym. Also new to exercise, he has since lost 30 pounds. ""She hit the ground running when she decided she'd finally had enough and hasn't looked back since,"" he said. ""I had anticipated that she might quit or lighten the load. ... Instead (she) got more intense. It's really amazing to see her go through her change."" Secret #4: Drink 16 ounces of juice . Not long ago, Ianuale started using a juice blender, drinking 16 ounces of juice every day, which she says is a major part of her weight-loss program. Her drinks vary, but typically she juices frozen blueberries, lemons, kale, spinach, pineapple, flax seeds, broccoli and carrots. Secret #5: Add variety . Once she got her food portions under control, she started adding more fruits and vegetables, and protein at dinner. Ianuale stays away from processed foods altogether. ""I don't eat greasy foods or junk food -- my stomach can't handle that anymore,"" she said. Secret #6: Give yourself one cheat day . But she isn't on her diet every day. ""Friday's my cheat day -- I don't go overboard with cheating, but that's my day."" She usually gets a weekly latte and goes out for a nice dinner, still eating somewhat healthy, with a salad or a protein with a vegetable side dish. And the occasional ice cream. After all of this weight loss, Ianuale feels amazing. ""I feel like I can do anything,"" she said. ""I have never been this weight or close to it before in my (adult) life. This is not a diet, it's a life change. This is my new lifestyle and I will never go back.""","Kari Ianuale lost 145 pounds in three years .

"(CNN) -- Right now, Bryan Cranston is The Man. It's not just ""Breaking Bad,"" on which he plays chemistry teacher-turned-meth mogul Walter White, grabbing headlines as it hurtles toward its finale. It's the sheer ubiquity of the actor, who's proven himself to be versatile, good-humored and clamorously in demand. When rumors surfaced about the ""Breaking Bad"" star playing Lex Luthor in the next ""Superman"" movie, they created an instant Internet firestorm -- and seemed utterly plausible. When Stephen Colbert was looking for a ""Get Lucky"" dance partner on his widely seen Daft Punk tribute show, of course he chose Cranston (plucking him out of a Charlie Rose interview). He appeared in recent episodes of ""The Simpsons"" (as White), ""The Cleveland Show"" (as Cleveland's physician, Dr. Fist) and ""30 Rock."" He even made a guest appearance in Jimmy Fallon's parody of ""Breaking Bad."" There's more. He's on newsstands. In the last two months alone, Cranston's been covered with debris on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, looked dapper on the August GQ and been the subject of a profile in The New Yorker. He's on the stage. He's starring in ""All the Way,"" a play about Lyndon Johnson by the Pulitzer winner Robert Schenkkan (""The Kentucky Cycle""). Producers are eyeing the play, which premiered in Boston this week, for a Broadway run. He's in theaters. He's got two movies scheduled for this year, ""Get a Job"" and ""Cold Comes the Night."" Last year he appeared in six: ""Red Tails,"" ""John Carter,"" ""Madagascar 3,"" ""Rock of Ages,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Argo."" All this Cranston hasn't gone unnoticed. When ""Argo"" director Ben Affleck requested Cranston for the film two years ago, producer Grant Heslov quickly agreed. ""Yeah, we should,"" he told Affleck. ""We're the only movie coming out next year that doesn't have him in it."" Too much Cranston? Hardly. He's known as a loyal friend and hardworking colleague -- and utterly unflappable. As writer Brett Martin observed in his GQ profile, the writers of ""Malcolm in the Middle"" frequently tried to throw Cranston off balance. But Cranston, as the show's daffy dad, Hal, approached all manner of humiliation -- tighty-whities, bee attacks, nude roller-skating -- with the same casual steadiness he now brings to Walter White (though, admittedly, without the menace). Photos: Memorable moments from 'Breaking Bad' ""Malcolm"" was Cranston's breakthrough, but he'd been a regular visitor on TV screens for almost two decades. Indeed, he was a familiar face even when his name was unknown, appearing in commercials for such brands as Lay's potato chips (opposite Michael J. Fox), JC Penney and Preparation H. (Hey, it was a good living.) In his TV and movie roles, he generally appeared as authority figures: cops, soldiers and the like. He played two different astronauts in Tom Hanks productions: Gus Grissom in ""That Thing You Do!"" and Buzz Aldrin in ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and later ""Magnificent Desolation."" (Cranston and Hanks share another connection: Cranston's wife, Robin Deardon, was one of Rita Wilson's bridesmaids at her 1988 wedding to Hanks.) But Cranston could show vulnerability when necessary. That's what prompted ""Breaking Bad"" creator Vince Gilligan to cast Cranston as White in the first place. Gilligan, a former ""X-Files"" writer, remembered a Cranston performance in an ""X-Files"" episode called ""Drive."" Cranston's character was a bigoted creep, but the actor made him sympathetic. Now he -- as the ""Breaking Bad"" catchphrase has it -- is the one who knocks. On Sunday, Cranston is up for his eighth Emmy as an actor -- he'a had three nominations for ""Malcolm"" and five for ""Breaking Bad."" He's won three times for his portrayal of Walter White, and given the attention surrounding him, he's the odds-on favorite for a fourth. He definitely has fans in his corner. ""They need to rename the Emmy the Cranston,"" wrote a commenter named Stan on HitFix.com. That probably won't happen -- but it doesn't need to. The actor is secure in his work: currently shooting a new version of ""Godzilla,"" scheduled for next year, and ready for more if he wants it. It's a far cry from the wounded Walter White, who once lamented, ""There was some perfect moment that passed me right by."" For the man named Bryan Cranston, the perfect moment is right now.","With many projects, upcoming ""Breaking Bad"" finale, Bryan Cranston is man of the moment .

"(CNN) -- The final round of qualifiers for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations threw up a few surprises, the most notable of which being holders Nigeria bowing out. The results of Wednesday evening also presented some potential logistical issues, as Guinea progressed to the finals next January, highlighting the problems that Ebola fears may cloud the event. The ruling African football body, CAF, last week removed Morocco as host, handing hosting duties to 2012 co-host Equatorial Guinea. The North African country had voiced concerns over the spread of the deadly disease in a number of West African countries and requested a postponement. As a further consequence, its team has been expelled from the competition, . The controversy had threatened to overwhelm the final round of games, played out this week, but by the end of Wednesday the 16 teams who will travel to the finals were known. Elephants ease into Finals . Ivory Coast qualified behind Group D winner Cameroon after a goalless draw between the two teams. The result was enough to fend off a late challenge from DR Congo after its 3-1 victory over Sierra Leone in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa. DR Congo's result, however, helped the team garner an impressive total of nine points, which saw the Leopards progress as the best-performing third place team from the seven groups, narrowly beating the reigning champions Nigeria to the remaining qualifying spot. Super Eagles crash out . Nigeria has been a regular fixture in the finals of the competition since its early days, but will be a notable absentee in Equatorial Guinea, mirroring 2010 holders Egypt in failing to qualify for the following edition of the tournament in 2012. The Super Eagles were held 2-2 by South Africa in Uyo, giving second-place in Group A to Congo, as the team recorded a 1-0 victory over Sudan in Khartoum. The South Africans topped Group A with 12 points from their qualifying campaign. Niger and Mozambique played out a dead rubber with a 1-1 draw, with fellow Group F teams Cape Verde and Zambia already having qualified before kick-off on Wednesday. Burkina Faso's draw with Angola was also largely academic, the west African nation having already joined Gabon in qualifying from Group C. Keita magic . Meanwhile, Mali booked their spot for the seventh consecutive time with a standout performance from captain Seydou Keita. The Roma midfielder opened the scoring with a well-taken penalty. Mali finished runners-up in Group B behind Algeria. A poor showing in Tunisia by Egypt saw the 2010 champions lose 2-1, and miss out on a place at the finals. Ghana's Black Stars ensured they progressed from Group F with a routine 3-1 win over neighbors Togo. They will be joined in the finals by Guinea, after a 2-0 victory over Uganda in the Moroccan city of Casablanca -- Ebola fears in the West African country ruling out home matches for the time being. The Ebola crisis threatens to loom large over the tournament. Host country of the finals, Equatorial Guinea, was disqualified earlier in the qualifying tournament for fielding an ineligible player, but were later reinstated. The final 16 . South Africa .

"Washington (CNN) -- Before Nina Pham headed back home to Dallas, Texas, she made one exciting final stop. The 26 year old nurse, who is now Ebola free, met with President Obama in the Oval Office this afternoon, where the president gave Pham a big hug. He wasn't the only one to hug Pham Friday. On Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, told reporters that Pham ""is cured of Ebola,"" following multiple tests that confirmed it. Fauci hugged her too. Pham was first diagnosed earlier this month after treating Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. She was the first person to be diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil days after Duncan died from Ebola. She came to the Washington region for treatment, attended by caregivers in hazmat suits. CDC: Travelers to U.S. from Ebola-stricken nations face new requirements . Her diagnosis caused an uproar among politicians who are now calling for tougher restrictions on travelers coming from three of the Ebola stricken countries: Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The administration has pushed back against calls for a travel ban, saying it will hurt more than help fight the disease in West Africa.

"(CNN) -- Ebola is now a big enough concern that the American people deserve some straight answers. And judging from the latest polling, plenty of people will be listening to what they are. On Wednesday, the Pew Research Center reported that more than twice as many Americans were paying attention to Ebola as were paying attention to the midterm elections (36% to 15%). In fact, Ebola placed higher than ISIS and the firing of the Secret Service director in terms of public attention. This is hardly surprising: The public is bound to want to know more about potentially fatal epidemics that seem to come from nowhere and have a high fatality rate. Indeed, Gallup reported Tuesday that one-in-five Americans worry about becoming infected with Ebola. Public fear is only likely to increase when the government seems confused and its story keeps changing. Just look at the early reaction to the spread of the disease. As recently as September 16, President Barack Obama said at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that: ""I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low."" The President went on to promise: ""We've been taking the necessary precautions, including working with countries in West Africa to increase screening at airports so that someone with the virus doesn't get on a plane for the United States."" He also characterized the chance of someone with Ebola reaching the United States as an ""unlikely event."" Fast forward less than a month, and someone infected with Ebola came from Liberia, via Brussels, to the United States (and has sadly since died). Clearly, the system of screening in place failed. During his CDC visit, the President also announced that some 3,000 American service men and women would be dispatched to fight Ebola in West Africa, a region where epidemiologists have estimated there could be between 550,000 and 1.4 million Ebola cases in Sierra Leone and Liberia alone by the end of January 2015. The experience of U.S. troops in Liberia a decade ago is a reminder of the additional risks American troops face when sent to places where dangerous diseases are widespread; roughly a quarter of American troops sent to Liberia in 2003 reportedly contracted malaria. Yet the administration seems not to have properly thought through how it will treat members of the U.S. military who might contract Ebola while deployed fighting the epidemic in Africa. Asked Tuesday if the military was stockpiling ZMapp, the experimental treatment for Ebola, Gen. David Rodriguez, head of Africa Command, said the military was not because it had not yet been proven effective. But given Ebola's extremely high fatality rate, it is hard to imagine there would not be plenty of patients who would at least prefer to be given a chance to try it. Meanwhile, the disease appears to have taken another country by surprise. Reporting on the case of a Spanish health worker who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, NPR noted that: ""A few months ago, Spanish officials were touting the country's ability to handle Ebola patients. ... But last night, the tone abruptly changed."" Spanish officials said they had no idea how the aid worker had been infected since ""as far as we know, she was wearing a protective suit the whole time and didn't have any accidental contact"" with the patient. So we have screening that didn't exist, a military commitment that is clearly inadequate but may put our troops at risk, and reassurances about suits that may not work. No wonder some U.S. senators are refusing to comment on the Obama administration efforts. As The Blaze reported, ""Sen. Mark Pryor, a second-term Democrat from Arkansas, stumbled badly this week when he admitted he isn't sure whether the Obama administration has done enough to protect Americans from Ebola, because he hadn't been briefed lately."" If a U.S. senator doesn't have a clue, it is little wonder so many Americans are suspicious that the Obama administration is once again drifting into failure, confusion and misinformation. All this leaves the public with many legitimate questions that need answering: What is the risk to the young men and women we are sending into West Africa? How many of them will come home infected with Ebola, malaria and a variety of other tropical diseases? What has to be changed at the National Institutes of Health to invest in new treatments for Ebola and a vaccine for prevention? What has to be changed at the Food and Drug Administration to fast-track Ebola-related medicines so we can save lives as rapidly as possible? Can the Centers for Disease Control develop a genuine operational capability to project effective public health assistance into West Africa and bring the epidemic under control in countries with governments too weak to be effective? Can we develop a screening process for passengers that is reliable and then insist that every person coming out of Ebola-infected areas be screened -- and, if necessary, quarantined? The American people deserve candid and, most importantly, accurate answers to such questions on what is a potentially deadly and dangerous epidemic.

"(CNN) -- President Obama's poll numbers have hit a new low and he's under fire for everything from the rise of ISIS to the response to the Ebola threat. So it may seem surprising to many readers that the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman -- who has been one of the president's strongest critics from the left -- has written a cover story for Rolling Stone entitled ""In Defense of Obama."" The article is important. Krugman rightfully directs our attention away from approval ratings and popularity -- measures that don't tell us much about the place of our leaders in American history -- insisting instead that we should be focused on things that a president actually does. By this measure, Krugman now argues that this administration has done a pretty good job overall. Indeed, as he moves through a list of his major policy accomplishments, Krugman concludes that Obama's legacy is downright impressive compared to his predecessors. ""Despite bitter opposition,"" Krugman writes, ""despite having come close to self-inflicted disaster, Obama has emerged as one of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in American history."" But it is much too early to tell whether Krugman's report card is correct. While he is spot on when saying that the policy record matters much more than short-term popularity as measured in the polls, the policy record of any president is extremely difficult to evaluate before a president has even finished his time in office. The other presidents who Krugman would hope that Obama has been able to emulate -- as well as conservative leaders, like Ronald Reagan and (I would argue George W. Bush) who have had lasting policy records -- couldn't really be judged until many years after leaving the White House. It usually takes some time to see whether a policy works. When LBJ pushed Congress to pass Medicare in 1965, policymakers were still unclear whether the program would really eliminate the horrendous conditions facing elderly Americans, most of whom could not afford adequate health care. But the final legislation that passed Congress, which added physicians insurance and Medicaid to the hospital insurance that Lyndon Johnson had supported, proved to be a stunning success. While the programs have been far from perfect, a fascinating book edited by Sheldon Danzinger and Martha Bailey, ""Legacies of the War on Poverty,"" convincingly demonstrates that the policies were extremely effective at eliminating this as a major social problem. But we didn't know that yet when Johnson was stepping down. In 1986 and 1987, Ronald Reagan caused quite a stir among his own supporters when he moved forward with negotiations with Mikhail Gorbachev, culminating in the INF agreement. Over the next few years we saw that this was an important step in the end of the Cold War. Yet from the perspective of 1988, the nation couldn't tell where this would all go. While there is evidence that Affordable Care Act is having a substantial impact we don't yet have enough evidence to judge how well it will do in ending the problem of uninsured Americans and lowering the costs of premiums. Another measure that we use to judge whether policies are successful has to do with their ability to outlast the political coalition that built them. Do they become entrenched in the system so that changes in the political winds don't result in their being dismantled? The Federal Reserve system, created during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, is an enduring and ingrained part of the nation's banking system over a century later. The agricultural policies that FDR put in place with Congress remain an integral part of the farming economy, as do the basic protections afforded to Americans who deposit their savings in banks. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been accepted by politicians from both parties even after many years of conservative backlash toward policies promoting racial equality. The same is true with the achievements of some conservative presidents. Although there have been a series of tax increases since 1982, no president has overturned the basic slash in income tax rates achieved by Reagan in 1981 that forever depleted the government of needed revenue. Thus far, President George W. Bush's vast expansion of the national security state in 9/11 has remained firmly in place; in fact it has expanded, even with President Obama in office. While presidential popularity doesn't tell us much about how a leader stacks up in history, the long-term popularity of programs does matter. Great policies usually generate loyal constituencies. This is part of what makes them so difficult to retrench. President Roosevelt famously said about Social Security taxes, ""with those damn taxes, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program."" He was right. Americans came to expect this as a benefit because of the taxes they paid, while millions of elderly Americans soon came to love their monthly pensionsâ€”as did middle class families who felt relief from having t\o shoulder the entire responsibility of taking care of their parents after their retirement. Right now, we don't know if Obama's programs will have this kind of feedback effect. His health care program remains unpopular, though more Americans want the program reformed rather than repealed, while his financial regulations have certainly not generated great admiration from middle class Americans who still feel that the world of finance favors the wealthy and who are less than confident the system won't collapse again. Obama's economic stimulus programs clearly helped the nation lift itself out of the Great Recession, but most Americans don't credit his policies with the improvements that the nation has seen and many feel that the president didn't do enough to help with the bigger structural problems facing a shrinking middle class dealing with insecurity. So Krugman has put forth an enormously important argument, but it is just too early to tell whether his early report card is correct. We need much more time to see what happens with the next administration, as well as what comes after, before we can really start to make clear judgments as to whether Obama's accomplishments were historic or whether he ends up being remembered as an average president.","Nobel-winning economist Krugman writes that Obama is one of most successful presidents .

"(CNN) -- Mitch McConnell could very well become the Senate majority leader after Tuesday's midterm elections, but don't count on Ted Cruz to make it an easy transition for the Kentucky Republican. Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas who's eying a 2016 presidential bid, all but promised to raise hell next year should his party control the Senate. In an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday, Cruz refused to pledge his support to McConnell, the current minority leader in the Senate, and outlined what he believes should be the chamber's priorities. Dems put up brave face ahead of election . While Cruz has campaigned for many mainstream Republican candidates this year, his new comments indicate he's aiming to re-claim the mantle of Republican insurgent, a role that helped define his first year in the Senate in 2013. The first priority next year, he told the Post, should be a string of hearings on President Barack Obama, ""looking at the abuse of power, the executive abuse, the regulatory abuse, the lawlessness that sadly has pervaded this administration."" Polls give GOP momentum going into midterms . He also hopes a Republican Senate will ""pursue every means possible to repeal Obamacare,"" just as the GOP-controlled House has tried more than 50 times to dismantle the health care law. Part of the effort, he said, should include forcing a vote that could avoid a possible filibuster by Democrats. If Obama vetoes the repeal, the Senate should vote on Obamacare provisions ""one at a time,"" according to the Post.

"(CNN) -- Welcome back, Frank Ocean. It's been two years since the Grammy-winning artist made a stellar debut with his album ""Channel Orange,"" and on Friday he quietly delivered a new song called ""Memrise."" While many musicians would roll out the PR red carpet for a new track, Ocean unveiled the meditative ""Memrise"" without any fanfare on his Tumblr. You can listen to the single on his site, frankocean.tumblr.com. The mood of ""Memrise"" feels similar to some of Ocean's work on ""Channel Orange,"" but it's experimental in his delivery. Rather than simply singing all of the song's lines, Ocean employs a more staccato, spoken-word delivery, saving his distinct vocals to close out the song. The lyrics themselves are intimate, telling the story of a sensual relationship. ""I memorized the wayward expressions/Never look down/Never let you see me down. I memorized the way no directions,"" Ocean says in the song. ""Can I come over now, I'd like to stay a little while. I memorized your body exposed/I could f*** you all night long/From a memory alone."" It's unclear if ""Memrise"" is a sign of what's to come on Ocean's highly anticipated second album, but it's a relief for fans who've been eager to hear more. In 2012, ""Channel Orange"" was a critical success, winning the Grammy for best urban contemporary album, and rumors of what's to come from the artist have been circling ever since. What we do know is that Ocean has been hard at work. Billboard reports that he's been clocking studio time with producers such as Hit-Boy and Rodney Jerkins.","Frank Ocean unveiled a new song Friday .

"London (CNN) -- Nine men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, London's Metropolitan Police said Thursday. The men, ages 22 to 51, were detained Thursday morning in London on suspicion of being members of a banned organization, supporting a banned organization and encouraging terrorism. They were taken to police stations in central London and remain in custody, a police statement said. Eighteen homes, business premises and community buildings across London are being searched as part of the investigation. Officers are also searching a home in Stoke on Trent in the English Midlands. ""These arrests and searches are part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist related terrorism and are not in response to any immediate public safety risk,"" said the Met Police statement. Police did not give the identities of those arrested nor name the banned organization concerned. But the UK's Press Association news agency cited sources as saying radical British cleric Anjem Choudary was among those arrested. Choudary, who was a co-founder of the banned UK Islamist group Al Muhajiroun, told CNN last month that the world had been split into two camps. There's a ""camp which believes that sovereignty and supremacy belongs to God. They are the Islamic State, at the head of which is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"" Choudary said. ""In the other camp you have those people who believe sovereignty and supremacy belongs to man. At the head of that camp is Barack Obama."" ""I believe this Islamic State will spread, rapidly, and I believe it will be in Europe and even America within decades."" Cameron lays out plans to counter UK jihadi threat . Parliament recalled . UK Prime Minister David Cameron called Wednesday for Parliament to be recalled Friday to debate the nation's response to a request from the Iraqi government for airstrikes to support operations against ISIS in Iraq. Speaking in New York, where he's attending the U.N. General Assembly, Cameron said he was convinced that ISIS is ""a direct threat"" to Britain and that the nation should join international efforts against the group in Iraq. ""What we are doing is legal, it is right, it does not involve British combat troops on the ground. But as ever with our country when we are threatened in this way, we should not turn away from what needs to be done,"" he said. ""I am confident we will get this through Parliament on an all party basis, and I think it is right for our country to be united at this time."" Any action against ISIS in Syria would require a separate parliamentary debate and vote, he said. Terror threat level raised . The Home Office has listed 60 international proscribed terrorist organizations as of August 2014. They include networks such as ISIS and al Qaeda, as well as UK-based groups such as Al Muhajiroun, which emerged in 1996 and has operated under a range of other names since being disbanded in 2004. The UK Home Office last month raised its terror threat level from ""substantial"" to ""severe."" The government also announced new measures to combat the threat from Islamist extremism, including a radical new measure to ban Britons from coming home once they join jihadi ranks abroad. UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups.

"(CNN) -- An intellectually disabled construction worker was freed Wednesday after nine years in a Texas prison, including four of them on death row, after his initial conviction for murdering a year-old infant was overturned. Manuel Velez, whose IQ is 65 and who is functionally illiterate in his native Spanish as well as English, was convicted in Brownsville in 2008 for murdering the year-old son of his then-girlfriend. But the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Velez in his appeal, said Velez was 1,000 miles away working construction in Tennessee when the child was injured. Velez's initial court-appointed attorneys failed to discover that evidence, and ""after his conviction, Manuel received the death penalty, largely because a state prison expert presented false testimony to persuade the jury that Manuel would pose a danger to society if given life without parole instead,"" the ACLU said. On Wednesday, an ACLU attorney described Velez, now 49, as an innocent man who was put on death row for a crime he didn't commit. ""Manuel never belonged in prison, let alone on death row waiting to be executed. He is indisputably innocent,"" Brian Stull of the American Civil Liberties Union's Capital Punishment Project said in a statement. ""My joy for him and his family today is tinged with sadness for the years our criminal justice system stole from him, all because he was too poor to afford better counsel than the lawyer the state appointed to him. ""We should be ashamed of the errors that put Manuel on the brink of execution. He is far from the only innocent person to receive a death sentence,"" Stull said. Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz called Stull's statement ""factually inaccurate and full of half-truths."" ""Nowhere near the child"" Attorneys for the ACLU contended that prosecutor's medical expert's records showed ""clear proof that the head injuries the baby sustained occurred when Velez was nowhere near the child,"" the ACLU said. During the trial, Velez's court-appointed lawyer also failed to ""discover and present the testimony of the many witnesses who said the girlfriend threw, hit, and dropped the baby and abused her children, while Manuel was never physically rough and always peaceful,"" the ACLU said. Velez's attorney also ""bungled his challenge to the typewritten statement that police persuaded Velez to sign, which said he had mistreated the child,"" the ACLU said. In fact, Velez was unable to read the statement, written in English, as he is functionally illiterate in both English and Spanish, the ACLU said. Also, Velez' primary language is Spanish, and he is a seventh-grade dropout, the ACLU said. Child's mother pleaded guilty . The child's mother, Acela Moreno, also was indicted for intentionally or knowingly causing the death of her son, Angel, by striking the boy's head with a hand or unknown object or against a hard surface in October 2005, according to court papers provided by the ACLU. Moreno accepted ""a plea bargain offer"" and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to her son, and she was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the court papers said. In exchange for the reduced charge, Moreno agreed to testify against Velez, but stated that Velez didn't strike her son on the day he was rushed to the hospital, where the child died two days later, the documents said. A jury convicted Velez of capital murder and sentenced him to death. An appeals court reversed the death sentence but affirmed the conviction in 2012, the court papers said. Saenz, the district attorney, said the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected all but one of the Velez legal team's claims of 45 points of errors in the conviction. That one point of error was the testimony by A.P. Merillat, a prosecution expert on the death penalty. Opinion: Execution, a 19th-century relic we still can't get right . 'Ineffective' defense attorneys . Merillat, a former police officer, was condemned by Texas' highest criminal court in 2012 for giving false testimony, the New York Times reported. ""In October 2008...Mr. Merillat testified that after 10 years of serving life without parole for Capital Murder, an inmate could gain a less restrictive classification from the Texas Department of Justice Institutional Division,"" Saenz said in a statement. ""In September 2005, Texas Department of Justice Institutional Division changed its regulations and no longer allowed for a less restrictive classification for inmates serving life without the possibility of parole in Capital Murder cases. Based on that testimony, and based on that alone, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the punishment of Manuel Velez,"" Saenz said. In 2013, Judge Elia Cornejo Lopez granted Velez a new trial ""on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel because of the actions and conduct by both Hector Villarreal and O. Rene Flores,"" the court papers said. Villarreal was deceased at the time of the ruling, and Flores wasn't immediately available for comment Wednesday. Death penalty facts that may surprise you . Prosecutor's response . The ACLU continued to criticize prosecutors Wednesday, saying that ""after Velez's conviction was overturned, and in the face of overwhelming evidence of his innocence, the State refused to dismiss the murder charge against him unless he took a plea,"" the ACLU said. Velez pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of injury to a child ""rather than face a new trial that could be plagued by the same injustices that sent him to death row,"" the ACLU said. But in his statement Wednesday, Saenz pointed out that ""at no point did any court, trial or appellate, or any jury make any finding that Mr. Velez was actually innocent of murdering Angel Moreno. ""In fact, every time the issue was brought up, it was found to be without merit. It was and continues to be the position of the Cameron County District Attorney's Office that Manuel Velez did contribute to the death of Angel Moreno, and he was and is being punished for that crime,"" Saenz said.

"Tijuana, Mexico (CNN) -- Part of the fence separating the United States and Mexico sits about 50 yards away from hundreds of tunnel-like holes and makeshift tents where people live, stuck between two countries. Trash surrounds the area, driven there by the sewage that runs through the nearby Tijuana River channel. The odor of rotting food and feces oozes from the ground; the warm weather and hot sun worsen the smell. The stench makes it hard to breathe, and it's harder to fathom how any human being could live in these conditions. Yet, an estimated 4,000 people call this place home, a stretch known as ""El Bordo,"" or ""the border,"" wedged along the U.S.-Mexico border. It's inside Mexico, just outside the city limits of Tijuana. With a disheveled shirt and shorts covered in dry gray sludge, Fernando Miranda smiles and points towards the fence, signaling the location of the place he once called home. He hasn't seen it in three years. ""I am heading back there and nowhere else. There is no way in hell I am staying here,"" Miranda said. Life on the border is complicated . Miranda and the others living in El Bordo are stuck in between two countries and their laws. He has nowhere to go and no place to call his own. Miranda was born in Mexico, and 25 years ago he illegally immigrated to the United States, the country where he worked and prospered, where his children were born, educated and given better opportunities. Miranda was sent back to Mexico in 2011, one of 2 million people who have been deported since President Obama took office. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed close to 369,000 undocumented immigrants -- most from Mexico and Central America -- from the United States. About 40% of those deported were sent back through the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Tijuana, according to Mexico's National Migration Institute. Opinion: Why I fasted for immigration reform . They arrive in Mexico with no form of identification, no money and often only the clothes on their backs. Most of those deported have no connection to Tijuana, no family or friends, and some can barely speak the language. That was the case for 37-year-old Miguel Valdez, who was in the United States legally just last week. He grew up in Los Angeles, having arrived in the United States with his parents when he was 4 years old. His mother and father came in illegally, but as an adult, Valdez got a green card, a four-year college degree and a job as a computer programmer. Then he got into trouble, arrested and convicted for drugs and illegal possession of a gun. After serving a five-year prison term, Valdez had his green card revoked just last week, and he was put on a bus and dropped off near Tijuana. Valdez has been wandering the unfamiliar streets of this foreign city for days, unable to find food, a job or a place to sleep. He speaks so little Spanish that he's afraid to ask for directions or help. He couldn't express in words what had happened to him: In the space of one week, he had gone from American resident to citizen of no-man's land. ""It just feels the gate itself is so far away, even if I'm standing right next to it,"" Valdez said, staring at the border separating him from the United States. Living in a hole in the ground . Miranda has been in El Bordo long enough that the others call him ""El Chino,"" a reference to his wild, curly hair. He hasn't had a haircut in years. His home, as he calls it, isn't much of a home but rather a deep hole in the ground cleverly built with trash and dirt. Shoestrings and pieces of clothes keep the wooden sticks and plywood together. The roof is the most impressive. ""See, it's pretty strong,"" Miranda said as he jumped on it. He seems to be proud of his efforts and shows off his construction skills, gained over years of working in Silicon Valley as a laborer. He and three other men helped built it. Deportations split families . Since his deportation in April 2011 -- the result of a traffic stop -- Miranda has lived in the slums of the Tijuana River canal. He arrived with nothing but the clothes he was wearing. Returning to his home state of Michoacan was not an option. After having lived in the United States for 25 years, Miranda had a home, a job and, most important, a family: a wife and four children, all American citizens. Miranda doesn't care to stay in Mexico, and he quickly learned that Mexico didn't care for him to stay, either. According to him, police in Tijuana assume that all deportees are criminals and drug addicts and consider them all a nuisance. The police constantly harass them for no reason, he says. The deportees have to hide underground to evade local authorities, and for them this is the safest place in Tijuana. ""I feel a lot worse here. Discrimination is a lot worse here. I am in my country, and they discriminate against me a lot worse. I can't even walk the streets. Instead of having laws that protect us, they make life even harder for us. I don't like it at all,"" Miranda said. A recent study conducted by Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a research center focused on regional issues at the border, found that 96% of the residents of El Bordo have been arrested by Tijuana police officers, 70% more than once. Tijuana police wouldn't officially comment on the situation at El Bordo, but they have openly called the deportees ""criminals"" and a public health threat to the city. 'No human being should live like this' Unwanted by the United States and Mexico, this is the place where thousands have found refuge while they save up enough money to cross back into the United States. ""It's a no-man's land. Mexico doesn't want you, and the U.S. sure as hell doesn't want you,"" said Hector Barajas, an activist and deportee who lives in a shelter outside Tijuana and advocates for those living in El Bordo. ""No human being should live like this."" Barajas, a U.S. Army veteran, had his green card revoked and was deported in 2004 after being convicted of a felony for shooting an illegal firearm. He has struggled to get back on his feet, but that hasn't stopped him from helping others. The fluent English speaker now counsels other newly arrived deportees and has joined other activists in Tijuana. He says the local government offers little to no help to the new arrivals, and so he and other activists try to help with food and shelter. ""They look at you as a criminal, a drug addict and stuff like that,"" Barajas said. ""When you get here, you come with nothing, so you probably spent four or five days in detention. You haven't shaved. You don't have money to buy a shaving kit or whatever. You look like you're homeless. That's what happens. The government doesn't have nothing in place for nobody."" He doesn't hide the fact that some of the deportees living at El Bordo are heroin addicts. And he doesn't need to. You can't walk through El Bordo without seeing the open usage of heroin, the dirty needles stuck behind ears like pencils and, more horrifying, others sharing them on the filthy concrete. One of the users is Robert Marquez, wearing his home city's baseball team on his cap: the Los Angeles Dodgers. ""My home is in L.A.,"" he proudly proclaimed. As we talked, Marquez's eyes started to lose focus, his words beginning to melt into each other. ""Are you high?"" I asked. ""Yeah,"" he said sheepishly, like a child caught eating too much candy. ""Why do you do the heroin?"" ""Why? I have no place to go. Where?"" he responded with finality. In Washington, the issue of how to deal with 11 million undocumented immigrants is at the core of the immigration debate. And no one seems to have the right answer on what to do. There's absolutely no discussion about what to do about the deportees, from either U.S. or Mexican authorities. Boehner says 'never mind' on immigration . Back at El Bordo, Miranda wastes no time counting down the days until he returns home. Unfortunately, Miranda's return to the United States will probably be made via some form of an illegal entry, just like the first time he crossed over from Mexico 25 years ago. ""I am just waiting for the right time to leave, just the right opportunity to cross over. The situation here is no good."" CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this story.

"(CNN) -- As college seniors across the country prepare to graduate, from the excitement over spring and looming freedom rises the familiar worry: Will I get a job? Will I get a job I actually want? The answer to both, it seems, is a resounding, if utterly inconclusive, maybe. A few weeks back, the U.S. Labor Department announced that while the job market is getting better -- unemployment among 2013 graduates is at 10.9%, down from 13% for recent graduates in 2012 -- it's still weaker than it was prerecession. What's more, those who are working have increasingly settled for jobs outside their fields of study or for less pay than they'd expected. Some 260,000 college graduates were stuck last year working at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, more than double the numbers of minimum wage-earning college grads in 2007. A friend's daughter graduating this week from UC Berkeley with dual honors degrees in sociology and math and four years of experience working in sexual assault advocacy on campus will be spending the summer working at her local Williams-Sonoma -- and readying grad school applications -- after a number of dead-end interviews with women's rights groups. ""And I feel grateful,"" she told me. There is good news, however. While many pregraduates still express feeling a certain pressure to make the ""right"" decisions early on to make the most out of every moment working in such a competitive professional atmosphere, the truth is that the job you take tomorrow, next week or even next year does not have to set the tone for your professional career. At a recent talk I gave to a writing workshop that a friend teaches at an East Coast university, the students had one big concern: How to avoid being ""pigeonholed"" if you're forced to take a first job that's less than your ideal. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not track lifetime careers -- and no one really knows where the old statistic that people average seven job changes over the course of a lifetime came from -- studies do show that job tenure has slowly but consistently been in decline over the past few decades. Job-hopping is now the new norm -- and while it's especially so during a person's early working years, it's pretty common in general. Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that most workers is the United States have been at their job for under a year, and that the average length of time anyone spends at any given job is 4.4 years. Stephanie, a friend of my daughter's, graduated from her Ivy League school two years ago. She imagined a career in magazine publishing -- she really wanted to be a beauty editor -- but ended up in finance instead. The money is good, and the job is fine, but it's not her passion. And so she has an end date in sight. ""I'm going to put in one more year and 'save up' for an unpaid internship in 2015,"" she told me. ""I don't mind starting from the beginning, if it's something I really want to do."" A 2013 poll by consulting firm Accenture proves how quickly career plans can change once graduates enter the ""real world."" In a study of 1,000 graduating seniors and 1,000 recent graduates, 18% of pending 2013 graduates planned to get a graduate degree. By contrast, that number increased to 42% among working graduates. Some 15% of pregrads expected to earn less than $25,000 a year. The number of those who ended up with that salary or less? 33%. College graduates are getting the message that planning too far ahead is an exercise in futility and perhaps limiting in itself. A survey conducted last year by Future Workplace found that 91% of millennials expect to stay in a job for less than three years (which could, in fact, add up to 15 to 20 jobs over the course of a lifetime). And according to the Accenture poll, while 53% of graduates found full-time jobs in their field of study, 34% said they were willing to take the first job they were offered. The truth is that most college graduates do not start out in their desired field, and endless life decisions will influence the path a college graduate's career takes over the next 40 or so years. A 2013 study conducted by McKinsey & Company found that 41% of graduates from top universities -- the presumably best and brightest -- could not land jobs in their chosen field after graduation. In other words, it's tough out there. The benefit to that, of course, is more time, even if forced, to explore a variety of areas of interest while feeling safe in the knowledge that there continue to be more job opportunities for those with a college education than for those without. Which is why the best thing graduating seniors can do as they approach the working world may be to keep an open mind and chill out a bit. And recognize that life -- personally and professionally -- demands a willingness to change. Because if there's a constant in the ever-in-flux job economy, it's that adaptability and flexibility are key to survival.","As college seniors across the U.S. graduate, they worry about finding a job .

"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) -- The search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham now includes the use of an aerial drone -- the first time, according to authorities, one has been used in the search for a missing person in the state. The addition of the drone to the seach effort comes more than two weeks after Graham disappeared from an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. The drone has a high-quality camera, and it will ""look closer"" at objects of interest, said John Coggin, chief engineer of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and one of the members of the team operating the drone. As the drone worked from overhead Wednesday, more than 50 law enforcement personnel participated in the search in Fairfax County. Where is Hannah Graham? Investigators believe Jesse Matthew, 32, was the last person with Graham, who was last seen September 13. He has been charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case, and he is being held in jail in isolation, according to Charlottesville police. Matthew is being held in isolation in a Virginia jail cell. Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old, a second-year student at the university. More than 3,000 tips to Graham's possible whereabouts have poured in, Carter Johnson, a police spokesman, said. As part of the search effort, police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. The drone is expected to help with the search of vast tracts of land in the country. Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know . The search of Wednesday also included U.S. Route 29, outside of Charlottesville, where another woman reportedly disappeared. The search follows reports that Virginia State Police found a ""new forensic link"" between the Graham case and the death of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Harrington was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. Route 29, and her remains were found on a farm months later. Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death. No arrests have been made in Harrington's case, and the cause of her death is still under investigation. CNN's Jason Morris, Ed Lavandera, Jean Casarez and journalist Betsy Kaufman contributed to this report.","Drone's camera will ''look closer'' at objects of interest, an official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner is again facing strong opposition from a group of conservatives who are trying to derail his strategy as time runs out to avert a shutdown. They are ripping his plan to kick the fight about the President's executive order on immigration until next year, arguing that voters who supported Republicans in last month's midterm elections expect Congress to wage the battle now. The resistance was expected, but it's not expected to be fatal to the bill. Boehner and top House GOP leaders knew that any plan short of barring all funding for federal agencies that issue new visas would be rejected by hardliners. While the group is loud, and is demanding multiple changes in return for their support, multiple House Republican aides and members are skeptical it will cause the bill to fail. But with the House vote likely coming next Wednesday - just a day before the government is slated to run out of money - the continued push and pull between conservatives on both sides of the Capitol and their leaders will keep the drama high right up until the last minute. On Tuesday, House Republican leaders outlined a bill to fund most federal agencies for a full year. But the bill would only approve money for the Department of Homeland Security - which issues new visas - through March. In addition, House Republicans scheduled scheduled a vote for Thursday on a measure authored by Florida GOP Rep. Ted Yoho, a conservative who often breaks with leaders, that explicitly calls the President's immigration actions unconstitutional. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz -- who helped coordinate conservatives ahead of last year's government shutdown -- made the unusual move Wednesday of crossing over to the House side of the Capitol to join a press conference with a handful of House conservatives. Cruz didn't mention Boehner's name, but his presence with about a half dozen House members was essentially a stick in the eye to the Speaker. The Texas Senator made his opinion clear on the latest House GOP plan telling the crowd he opposed ""having a meaningless show vote."" The move clearly frustrated allies of GOP leadership in the House. When asked about the rally, North Carolina GOP Rep. Rene Ellmers told CNN flatly that ""Sen. Cruz needs to stay in the Senate."" Referring to last year's shutdown that many credit Cruz with instigating, Ellmers added: ""I think Sen. Cruz wants to fan the flames here but I think everyone here has become more savvy to his ways."" Senate Republican leaders and their aides expressed confidence the House bill would get enough GOP support to pass the bill and send it to the Senate. They adamantly oppose a government shutdown and the political damage they fear it would do just as Republicans are taking control of the chamber. ""There's not going to be a government shutdown,"" incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told XM Sirius radio on Wednesday. ""Obviously, we think the President has been way out of line with his executive amnesty and we certainly don't approve of that. But, you know, shutting down agencies of the government that have nothing to do with immigration serves no purpose other than to rattle the economy."" Those House Republicans opposed to the bill say along with Cruz, other Senate conservatives like Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mike Lee of Utah and David Vitter of Louisiana are pressing for the House to take a bolder stance. Some of these conservatives are complaining that this latest plan from Republican leaders doesn't match the rhetoric they used after the President laid out the details of his plans on immigration last month. ""It's hard for me with every major figure in our party -- starting with Reince Priebus coming down to the lowliest of members like myself -- saying we are going to do everything we can to stop this and to do nothing to stop it really hurts,"" Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina told reporters Wednesday. But House Republican aides say that discussions among members aren't turning up opposition from large numbers of members outside the group that typically splits with leaders on annual spending bill votes. Texas Republican Rep. Bill Flores, who was recently elected to head up an influential group of House conservatives, told CNN late Tuesday he thought what Boehner outlined was ""a good strategy."" ""We are where we are, and it's still a decent way to handle it and still provide some ability to check the President later on,"" Flores said. Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins was among a group of conservative members who met with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday morning. He told CNN he is still reviewing the details, but is open to supporting the leadership's plan. ""You fight strategically,"" Collins stressed, noting he still serves in the Air Force. He said despite GOP Senators like Cruz and other outside groups urging a major effort to strip out money for the executive action, the reality is that until next year, Democrats still control the Senate so it's important to look ""at the long term battle."" It's possible some tweaks are made to the plan. There is some discussion about moving the date on the provision in the spending bill that funds the department of Homeland Security to late January, or sometime in February so that the newly sworn in GOP Senate and House can try to work on a strategy earlier to challenge the immigration plans. Ellmers predicted that Republicans will still need some Democrats will back the measure. That's been the case with every annual and short term spending bill that has come to the floor since Boehner became Speaker. House Democrats are holding back on how they will approach the vote - saying they are still waiting on final details. On Tuesday, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer called the GOP plan ""a game"" and ""bad policy,"" but declined to say he would urge his colleagues to oppose it. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid suggested he could support the plan. For now, Democrats are once again enjoying sitting back and watching the public feud among Republicans.","Congress must pass legislation by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown .

"Washington (CNN) -- One day after the fourth case of Ebola was diagnosed in the United States, lawmakers met with administration and public health officials in an already-scheduled congressional hearing to hash out some concerns about the handling of the deadly virus. Here are four concerns raised in the hearing: . 1. Why hire a lawyer? Ebola czar Ron Klain was invited to attend the hearing, but having started the job just this past week, he did not accept the invitation. In his absence, a few Republicans tweaked President Obama for choosing Klain, a lawyer with managerial experience, over someone with expertise in medicine. ""Why in the world did the president pick a dadgum lawyer?"" Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, asked at the hearing, pointing out that Klain doesn't have a background in communicable disease, infectious disease, or West Africa. ""If this were an outbreak of people who don't have wills in West Africa, or if this were an outbreak on contested elections in West Africa, then I'd say yeah, go hire Mr. Klain,"" Gowdy conintued. ""But it's not. It's a medical crisis."" GOP slams Klain pick as Ebola czar . Nicole Lurie, a medical doctor and assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, emphasized that the job entails coordinating the multiple agencies that are dealing with the crisis, and a medical background isn't necessary. Gowdy then challenged her to take notice if the president ever appoints a doctor to the Supreme Court, arguing that it's unlikely because that person doesn't have experience in the law. After their exchange, Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia jokingly chimed in to support the idea of appointing a non-lawyer to the Supreme Court, saying it would be ""the healthiest damn thing we've had in the last 50 years."" 2. Longer quarantine time for troops in Africa? By the end of the year, the U.S. military will have deployed about 3,000 troops to help with humanitarian efforts on the ground in West Africa. Defense officials at the hearing said soldiers will be held for 10 days at the end of their service, isolated from exposure to Ebola. Who is the new Ebola czar? If they fall into a low-risk category, they'll then be transferred to the United States to be monitored for another 21 days. But multiple lawmakers at the hearing took issue with bringing the troops back to the U.S. after only 10 days. ""Is there any reason why we wouldn't just want to use a 21-day waiting period in West Africa before we bring people back to the United States?"" asked Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. Major Gen. James Lariviere, deputy director of political-military affairs in Africa with the Defense Department, said the 21-day monitoring period in the U.S. is a standard procedure recommended by the CDC. And the initial 10-day period in West Africa is an extra buffer of time to make sure soldiers aren't exposed to Ebola before they travel to the U.S. and start the three-week monitoring. Timeline of first Ebola patient in New York City . Facing more pushback from Cartwright and others, the Defense officials at the hearing promised to consult with military leaders about extending the 10-day period in Africa to the full 21 days. 3. Nurses need better materials, training: Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, spelled out what she believed was a dire need of equipment and better education to protect nurses while treating Ebola patients. According to a survey done by the group of 3,000 nurses at more than 1,000 hospitals in the U.S., 85% of nurses say they haven't been adequately trained. Gowns and material worn by nurses in Dallas who treated the first Ebola patient in the U.S. still had their necks and wrists exposed, Burger said. Two of them contracted Ebola. ""This is what happens when guidelines are inefficient and voluntary,"" she said, asking that Congress pass legislation or the president issue an executive order that mandates the kind of equipment medical professional should wear. 4. The CDC should have been more careful: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially said that the U.S. was prepared and ready to prevent the spread of Ebola. But after the two nurses came down with the virus, the organization was forced to admit that it made mistakes and began to issue more caution about the virus. Connolly said he was frustrated with how the CDC tried to educate the public about the Ebola virus, saying you should ""never reassure the public when you don't know."" ""Never do that because when you do that, you damage your credibility,"" he said. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, argued Americans are tired of hearing officials take extra steps out of ""an abundance of caution"" after an Ebola scare. ""The American people need to see the abundance of caution beforehand,"" Rep. Collins said. Lurie, the HHS official, said, ""We see that it is a work in progress and what you're seeing is we're taking constant steps to adjust as we learn more.""","Ron Klain is President Barack Obama's 'Ebola czar,' who started Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- With Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry set to meet in Vienna and the November 24 deadline to the P5+1 and Iran nuclear talks in sight, the White House's ability to provide Iran with significant sanctions relief early in a nuclear deal remains unclear. At the same time, any perceived failure by the U.S. to deliver could complicate, if not poison, what will already be a tenuous post-deal period. U.S. negotiators have not helped their cause. During the latest round of talks in New York, the U.S.'s lead negotiator, Wendy Sherman, promised that ""as soon as we [the U.S.] suspend our major sanctions -- which will happen very early in the agreement -- the world will flood into Iran."" Her comment was echoed by that of Western diplomats, who likewise urged the Iranians ""not [to] underestimate the huge economic relief for their people"" in case of a nuclear deal. Holding out the carrot to Iran is a sensible negotiating strategy, but only insofar as the U.S. and its European partners can deliver on it. Few, however, believe that to be the case. Companies that would otherwise jump at the opportunity to capture Iran's enormous market are being advised to take a wait-and-see approach in the case of a nuclear deal. At the same time, Iran's population -- according to recent polling -- remains in a state of disbelief as to the U.S.'s willingness to lift the sanctions and turn the page in its relationship with Tehran. This should be a major source of concern. It'd be the ultimate tragedy for the White House, which has spent as much political capital as it has on the nuclear negotiations, to have defeat snatched from the jaws of victory thanks to the lingering effects of its sanctions. With a region in turmoil as ISIS, which calls itself the ""Islamic State,"" continues its rampage through Iraq and the Levant, the Obama administration cannot afford the outbreak of hostilities with Iran. That's why President Obama must take steps to instill confidence in all parties that the U.S. can uphold its end of any nuclear bargain. What can the White House do? First, control the process. What the White House needs to do is take control of the sanctions file, create a plan of action for sanctions relief, and oversee the various federal agencies involved with sanctions enforcement. Some of that has occurred during the interim period of negotiations -- as the White House was not keen on any surprises that would frustrate the Iranians and the nuclear talks in the process -- but White House involvement needs to accelerate if sanctions relief is to take place in a clear and coordinated fashion. Why is this so important? Because European, Asian, and even potentially U.S. firms will be looking at the roll-out of sanctions relief to gauge the speed and confidence with which they (re-)enter Iran. Companies' legal advisers will be paying close attention to whether there is uniformity in the way federal agencies interpret the relevant rules and regulations, including what are expected to be broadened licensing schemes for more expanded trade with and investment in Iran. Uniformity of this kind can only come about under the explicit direction of the White House. Second, signal a shift. While a nuclear deal promises to bring to a close the most tense chapter in U.S.-Iran relations, the post-deal landscape could see the two parties hedging their bets, as commitments are weighed and obligations deferred. Outside observers will view all of this with skepticism, and caution will give way to stasis as the risk of a nuclear deal falling apart dissuades foreign companies from starting up business in or with Iran. That is why the White House must signal a shift in their approach to Iran. That means not just relieving sanctions on a schedule agreed to in the negotiations, but also taking additional measures that persuade firms that there is a sea-change underfoot in the way the West deals with Iran. For starters, the White House should continue a dialogue that has been opened with the Iranians for the first time in three-plus decades. It is no secret that the regional landscape has turned decisively in favor of U.S.-Iran cooperation -- ISIS is a mutual antagonist. Continued negotiations on the range of outstanding issues could signal a change of pace between the two long-time adversaries. The White House could also take discrete measures that instill confidence in firms interested in doing business with Iran. This includes setting up a direct financial channel to select Iranian financial institutions for the processing of licensed transactions. Such a channel could be run from the Federal Reserve, which maintains correspondent relations with banks all over the world. This would ensure that OFAC-licensed activities are able to be undertaken by U.S. persons and would signal to U.S. and foreign financial institutions alike that dealings with Iran are not as risk-prone as in the prior period. Third, reach out and advise. Fair or not, there is a lot of fear out there. Most firms avoid Iran -- even when engagement is permitted -- out of terrified respect for U.S. sanctions enforcers. That means there will need to be a lot of hand-holding to guide U.S. and foreign firms through the thicket of rules and regulations providing Iran sanctions relief. Most companies will need official assurance not once, not twice, but again and again, before undertaking transactions with or activities in Iran. The White House should be prepared to do the requisite outreach and ensure that both the Treasury and State Department are well-staffed to advise firms on the scope of permissible activities. In spite of the wrong-headed advice of its closest allies, the Obama administration has courageously pursued the diplomatic path with Iran. That political courage cannot have been in vain. If, as a senior Obama administration official said this week, ""the next two years will be transformative in...[the U.S.-]Iran relations...,"" then the White House needs to first ensure that it upholds the U.S.'s end of a nuclear bargain. That means not just being prepared to offer Iran sanctions relief, but making sure that the relief sticks and its benefits inure to Iran and its people. There is no better way, after all, to avoid the outcome a nuclear Iran.","White House's ability to provide Iran with sanctions relief is unclear, writes Tyler Cullis .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel clinched a record equaling fourth successive world title Sunday with another superbly judged drive to win the Indian Grand Prix. The 26-year-old German has joined compatriot Michael Schumacher and Argentine legend Juan Manuel Fangio as the only men to achieve that feat by wrapping up the 2013 championship with three rounds still remaining. Only two-time champion Fernando Alonso could have denied him the title, but the Spaniard finished back in 11th in his Ferrari. Nico Rosberg finished a distant second for Mercedes with Romain Grosjean completing the podium places in third after Vettel's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber saw his race ended on lap 40 of 60 by an alternator problem. This did not prevent Red Bull from clinching their fourth straight constructors' title on a day of double triumph for the UK-based team. Vettel was winning his sixth straight Grand Prix, his seventh in eighth races in a run which has seen him pull clear of his fellow title contenders. ""To be able to join people such as Michael (Schumacher) and Fangio is unbelievable,"" said Vettel as he celebrated his victory. ""I'm overwhelmed, one of the best days of my life,"" he added. Vettel, who started from pole, pitted on the second lap to change to the longer lasting medium tire, leaving Webber to lead the way in his quest to mark his final year in F1 with a victory. But after the final round of tire changes, Vettel was well set to complete his hat-trick of victories at the Buddh International Circuit even before Webber's race came to a premature end. View: CNN's F1 interactive for latest results and standings . Vettel avoided a similar fate and took the checkered flag in splendid isolation for his 10th victory in 16 races and 36th of his remarkable career. He can match Schumacher's 2004 record of 13 victories if he can continue his incredible run of success in Abu Dhabi, the United States and Brazil. The dogged Alonso, who was runner-up to Vettel last season, was handicapped by an early collision with Webber, leaving his teammate Felipe Massa to take fourth place with Sergio Perez an excellent fifth for McLaren. Lewis Hamilton took sixth in the second Mercedes, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus, who denied Vettel the fastest lap after a late change on to the faster, but quickly deteriorating softer tire. Paul Di Resta and Adrian Sutil occupied the next two spots for Force India in their home grand prix with Daniel Ricciardo claiming the final point for Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso.","Sebastian Vettel clinches fourth successes F1 world title .

"Washington (CNN) -- Responding to the uproar over physical searches of children, the Transportation Security Administration is rolling out new procedures that should reduce, although not eliminate, the number of times children are patted down at airport checkpoints. Under the new procedures, children age 12 and younger will be allowed to keep their shoes on, the TSA said. If a metal detector or full-body image detects a suspicious object, the children will be allowed multiple passes through the machines in an effort to identify the anomaly. Finally, airport screeners will have the option of swabbing the children's hands to check for explosive residue as an alternative to patting down the children. Pat downs will be used only if concerns persist. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on Tuesday told a Senate committee the TSA will roll out the new procedures in the coming weeks and months. ""It does require additional training of all of the thousands of TSA officers and that's under way,"" she said. In the spring, the TSA modified the actual pat down procedures, refining the parts of the body officers touch, amid widespread criticism that the pat downs were too intrusive. Since then, the TSA has been testing a variety of protocols to see if it could address public concerns without jeopardizing security. The pilot program, which has been going on since August at six airports, has shown the TSA could reduce the number of times it has had to pat down children, a TSA official said. The six airports are Boston Logan International, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Miami International, Orlando International, Houston Intercontinental and Denver International. The furor over screening of children erupted in spring after a video posted on YouTube showed a 6-year-old girl being searched at New Orleans airport on April 5. The girl protests the search at first, although she complies quietly while it is under way. TSA chief John Pistole said at a Capitol Hill hearing in spring that a female security screener performed the pat down on the girl because the child had moved while passing through the imaging machine. That prevented the device from getting a clear reading. Pistole suggested then that a pat down of a child is not entirely unjustified. ""Unfortunately we know that terrorists around the world have used children as suicide bombers,"" Pistole said.","TSA responds to criticism of pat downs for children with new procedures .

"(CNN) -- Tucked away in the Canadian province of Manitoba for several weeks each autumn is the largest wild polar bear concentration in the world. An estimated 1,000 or so polar bears gather near the small town of Churchill, waiting for Hudson Bay to freeze over so they can hunt seals and other marine mammals. This annual migration provides tourists, photographers and scientists from around the world the unique opportunity to view polar bears up close and personal. ""The most inspiring element of this adventure is the opportunity to lock your gaze with a wild polar bear,"" said John Gunter, the general manager of Frontiers North Adventures, an outfitter that hosts tourists to the remote region each year. The bears are intriguing to watch. ""Each has his or her own personality -- just like humans,"" said Robert Buchanan of Polar Bears International, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the worldwide conservation of the polar bear. ""Some bears are shy, some are playful, while others are grouchy or aggressive."" There are some 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears around the world. Polar bears top the food chain in the Arctic, and people view them as a majestic symbol of the far north, said Buchanan. Yet despite their mighty presence, polar bears are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, with eight of the 19 polar bear subpopulations in decline, according to Krista Wright, the executive vice president of PBI. Annual migration cycle of polar bears is changing . Each summer, the ice melts on Hudson Bay, forcing polar bears ashore. Once on land, without access to seals and other marine mammals, the bears enter a state known as walking hibernation. They live off their fat reserves and spend most of the summer resting and conserving energy, said Steve Amstrup, the chief scientist who studies the bears for Polar Bears International. Some polar bears will roam up to 900 miles along the coast in search of food, such as berries, grasses and kelp, but these don't meet their nutritional needs, he said. As autumn approaches, the bears migrate back to the Churchill region, where the annual freeze-up occurs sooner than elsewhere. As soon as the bay freezes, they scatter across the ice to hunt. The bears catch their prey from the surface of the sea ice. They remain there until the ice melts in summer and then the cycle repeats itself. Over time, global warming and diminishing sea ice habitat have been the greatest threats to the bears, since this environment substantially reduces hunting opportunities, said Wright. The ice has always melted each summer on Hudson Bay, forcing polar bears onto land. However, Wright said global warming has increased the amount of time the bears are separated from their main source of food, which is a problem. PBI reports in just 20 years, the ice-free period in Hudson Bay has increased by an average of 20 days, cutting short the bears' seal hunting season, leaving them with little or nothing to eat. The U.S. Geological Survey projects that two-thirds of polar bears will disappear by the year 2050, as climate change melts sea ice. How to view the polar bears during migration . The most accessible and safest place in the world for tourists to view wild polar bears is in the Churchill Wildlife Management Area during the autumn months, Buchanan said. ""Polar bears do gather in places like Russia's Wrangel Island to wait for freeze-up, but the tourism infrastructure isn't there, as it is in Churchill,"" he said. Many tourists visit the polar bears via a tundra buggy, an all-terrain vehicle that provides a safe haven for polar bear viewing and photography. The experience is somewhat like going on an Arctic safari, and only two tour operators in the area provide this service, Frontiers North Adventures and Great White Bear Tours. The buggies resemble wide buses, sit high off the ground, and are designed for the rugged conditions. The all-terrain vehicles move as fast as 5 miles per hour along a network of 24 miles of ungroomed and often rock- and snow-covered trails inside the Wildlife Management Area. The buggies carry between 10 and 40 people at a time and a typical trip lasts about eight hours. Sometimes, polar bears will walk right up to the buggies. ""During their first interaction with a wild polar bear many guests are brought to tears,"" said Gunter. ""As a host, it's really fulfilling for me to watch and feel our guests' experiences with the bears."" The optimal time to view the wild polar bears is in October and November, when visitors can typically see between 10 and 30 polar bears a day. To reach the Churchill area, most travelers fly or drive to Winnipeg, the provincial capital, then catch a 620-mile chartered or commercial flight north to Churchill. Hotel rooms during the peak season average about $250 U.S. per night. An all-inclusive package, including airfare, can range from $2,450 to $8,700 per person. For wildlife enthusiasts who can't make the trip to Manitoba, a live HD camera video feed of the polar bear migration ritual and other indigenous animals is available. Starting this week and throughout the month of November, CNN.com/Live in partnership with explore.org will stream live video from Churchill of the polar bear migration. Explore.org is a nonprofit multimedia organization created to inspire lifelong learning. Stream times will vary based on polar bear activity and news events of the day. CNN.com's first live stream will be Tuesday, November 1, at 4 p.m. ET. Users can check the schedule at live.cnn.com for future show times. ""The polar bears are among the most magical of our planet's endangered species, and much like the tigers of Asia, have come to represent the many consequences of global warming and industrialization,"" said Charles Annenberg Weingarten, filmmaker and founder of explore.org. ""By providing a window into their worlds, we are giving people a chance to come together to cherish the bears and an opportunity to share their plight in a compelling way."" Buchanan said the video project is a powerful way to inspire people to care about polar bears and their Arctic. ""When you look into a polar bear's eyes, it changes your life forever,"" he said. ""You want to do everything you can to save them."" CNN's Neda Davis and Mervyn Teo contributed to this report.","Manitoba hosts the world's largest wild polar bear concentration in autumn .

"(CNN) -- New Hampshire Senate Candidate Scott Brown responded to news that a new case of Ebola has been diagnosed in New York City, calling for ""common-sense prevention mechanisms"" in a statement released by his campaign Friday. ""The way to stop mass infection is by swift and decisive action, including a travel band and quarantining health workers returning from countries where Ebola is prevalent,"" the release reads. ""This is not a time for political correctness."" Preventing the spread of Ebola was a major topic of Thursday night's New Hampshire Senate debate, where Brown criticized incumbent Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen for relying on expert advice on how to contain the disease. In the debate, Brown repeatedly voiced support for a travel ban to blockade passengers from Ebola-infected African countries to enter the U.S., a strategy medical experts have said would be counterproductive.

"(CNN) -- British officials, citing worries that singer Chris Brown might pose a danger to British citizens, barred him from entering the United Kingdom for concerts this week, a UK border official said. Brown pleaded guilty last year to a felony charge of assaulting his then-girlfriend, pop star Rihanna. ""We reserve the right to refuse entry to the UK to anyone guilty of a serious criminal offense,"" said Barbara Woodward, director of the UK border agency's international group. ""Public safety is one of our primary concerns."" The 21-year-old R&B singer was scheduled to perform Wednesday night in Glasgow, Scotland, with shows in three English cities -- Manchester, Birmingham and London -- scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Sunday, according to his official website.  He was then scheduled to perform in Cork, Ireland next Tuesday. A publicist for Brown's UK tour said the shows in England, Scotland and Ireland were canceled ""due to issues surrounding his work visa."" Brown vented in Twitter messages posted online to his fans late Monday: . ""U ever feel like the storm clouds are too thick for any sunshine to get through?"" ""think ima go away!!!!"" Brown was sentenced last August to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for the assault conviction. A British Home Office official told CNN that ""because of his felony charge, it might not be a very good idea"" to allow Brown into the country. The official asked not to be quoted by name because he was not authorized to speak to the media about the matter.","NEW: Publicist says shows cancelled over ""work visa"" issues .

"(CNN) -- Back in the summer of 1999, along with thousands of other Canadian twenty-somethings, I set out on a post-collegiate backpacking trip through Europe. While on a train from Munich to Amsterdam, I looked across the aisle and spotted another solo female traveler. Like me, she had a large Canadian flag sewn to the top of her backpack. ""Where in Canada are you from?"" I asked, happy to be sharing the long journey with a fellow poutine eater. But something wasn't right. She began to squirm and wouldn't look me in the eye. ""Um, Toronto,"" she said. After a bit of interrogation, she came clean. She was actually from Minnesota -- close enough to her northern neighbor that her accent wouldn't immediately alert suspicion, but far enough away, culturally speaking, that her attempt at deception was doomed to wither beneath the suffocatingly courteous inquiry of a curious Canuck. Her admission was understandable. Eight hours is a long time to try to fool a Canadian into thinking you're one of the tribe. Ugly Americans a thing of the past? In 1999, my American train mate's attempts to deceive were somewhat forgivable. The U.S. military was hot and heavy in Kosovo. Americans weren't looked upon favorably in many international quarters. But do today's Americans still feel the need to jack the Canadian flag while traveling abroad? I wouldn't have thought so. After all, these days it's the Chinese who are being called ""the new ugly Americans."" Yet according to Canadian flight booking website FlightNetwork.com, pretending to be Canadian by wearing that glorious red maple leaf still gets Americans better service when they're abroad, provided they're able to act the part, too. In honor of Canada Day on July 1 -- remember that date if you want to have a hope in h-e-double-hockey-sticks of fooling anyone -- the Ontario-based site brought in a body language expert to provide tongue-in-cheek advice on how Americans and Brits can try to fake their Canadian-ness. ""Using quintessentially Canadian symbols, body language and facial expressions is a time-tested way to enhance the travel experience abroad,"" says Allison Eberle, vice president of operations for FlightNetwork.com. ""It's not surprising that travelers from other nations would do their best to come off Canuck."" The site commissioned body language expert and author Mark Bowden of TruthPlane Inc. to demonstrate ""faux Canadiana contortions that immediately betray a 'flag-jacker' -- be they American, English or other."" Here are a few tips he lays out in the video. The Maple-o-gy: A Canadian gesture showing submission by raising the shoulders in an apologetic motion, presenting oneself as nonthreatening. The Canuck Crinkle: Showing the creases around your eyes when smiling -- indicates genuine friendliness. The Toque Tilt: Slight tilting of the head when smiling, shows courtesy and congeniality. Alternately, absence of the gesture can help you spot a fake Canadian. Stars and Gripes Forever: Chin jutted out, face blank (or worse, frowning), causing the recipient of the message to assume something is wrong before the traveler has spoken. American Psycho: A well-meaning but misplaced gesture in which arms are outstretched with palms down, above the heads of others, in an attempt to calm a situation ... a move that usually has the effect of escalating tensions. The Polka-Loon: Overdoing friendly head tilt in a manner that implies you might need pharmaceutical assistance. This is all reasonable advice, but body language and Canadian flags alone won't fool anyone. If you're really going to convince people you're Canadian, here are two more tips to throw into the mix. Say you're sorry. For everything . ""Is it true what they say? If a Canadian apologizes three times the maple fairy brings you a hockey puck signed by Rick Moranis?"" An American friend recently asked me this when I sent him an email apologizing multiple times for being unable to make it to a planned dinner. Joke all you like, we're proud of our reputation for extreme politeness. When two Canadians accidentally bump into one another, a bizarre ritual often ensues. No matter who's at fault, both parties will apologize. Repeatedly. It's a reflex. If you stick out your leg and trip me, I'll say ""sorry"" to you. After all, I could have hurt your foot. ""Did you know he's Canadian?"" When a celebrity comes from the Great White North, no Canadian can resist pointing it out to non-Canadians who might be within earshot. When Pamela Anderson, Paul Anka, Jim Carrey, Leonard Cohen, Keanu Reeves, Ryan Gosling, Ryan Reynolds, William Shatner, Linda Evangelista or Dan Aykroyd come up in conversation, you'll see us fidget and grow visibly agitated till we have a chance to blurt out ""Did you know he/she is from Canada!?"" Study this list of famous Canadians before you hit the road. Shout out their nationality proudly to whoever is listening when they appear on TV or their music is played. You'll fit right in. The only exception is when discussions turn to Justin Bieber or Celine Dion. You Americans can claim them as your own if you'd like. We don't mind. Happy Canada Day!

"(CNN) -- The World Heritage Committee has given Australia another year to prove it's doing enough to protect the Great Barrier Reef or suffer the humiliation of having it enter the list of sites in danger. The country has been scrambling to ensure adequate measures are in place after a damning review of the reef's health and safety at the last committee meeting in 2013. The World Heritage Committee said on Wednesday it is still concerned about planned coastal developments, including planned new ports and liquified natural gas facilities. However, World Heritage Center director Kishore Rao said in a statement, ""UNESCO is confident the overall direction towards next year's decision is a positive one."" Australian Environment Minister Greg Hunt declared the year delay ""a positive outcome for Australia and we can be proud of our achievements in protecting the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area."" Rich in biodiversity . Stretching 2,000 kilometers down the coast of the state of Queensland, the Great Barrier Reef boasts the greatest biodiversity of any World Heritage Site. It's home to hundreds of species of coral, fish, bird and mollusks, but also runs along a busy coastline lined with farms, towns and beaches that attract millions of tourists each year. Conservationists say not enough is being done to protect the region from the burden of business interests, particularly a planned coal port at Abbot Point, near the city of Bowen. ""The first step must be to immediately ban the dumping of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Dredging and dumping for new port developments pollutes Reef waters, and the majority of Australians want to see an end to this outdated practice,"" said the World Wildlife Fund's Australia reef campaigner Richard Leck. In a report released in April, UNESCO ""noted with concern"" proposals to dump three million cubic meters of dredge spoil inside the World Heritage area from the Abbot Point site. It said it also ""regrets"" the approval for the dredge spoil to be dumped ""prior to (the government) having undertaken a comprehensive assessment of alternative and potentially less impacting development and disposal options."" In a statement following the Committee's extension of the deadline on Wednesday, Minister Hunt defended the decision, saying the approval of the Abbot Point development ""complied with Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention, was subject to rigorous environmental assessment and applied Australia's world-leading net benefit approach."" 'Years of neglect' The degradation of the Great Barrier Reef has been occurring for decades, according to scientific reports and anecdotal evidence. In a speech on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., actor and director Leonardo DiCaprio declared he'd seen the ""devastation"" firsthand. ""What once had looked like an endless underwater utopia is now riddled with bleached coral reefs and massive dead zones,"" he said, comparing his experience diving on the Great Barrier Reef 20 years ago to a dive at the same location two years ago. The same year, in 2012, the then environment minister Tony Burke admitted that years of neglect had contributed to a sharp drop in the reef's coral coverage. ""There's no doubt there's been a level of neglect for decades which if it had been dealt with otherwise we'd be in a much better situation now,"" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, at the time. He was responding to a report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the University of Wollongong that the reef had lost half of its coral cover in the last 27 years. Most of the damage was inflicted by tropical cyclones, the report concluded, as well as coral predation by the crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching, mostly caused by warmer water. Battered by cyclones . Images released this week by the Catlin Seaview Survey show the devastating effects of Cyclone Ita, a category five tropical cyclone, which hit the region in April. Before and after images show colorful coral snapped and flattened by waves whipped by fierce winds, which smash reefs, especially those not far from the surface. ""There is a myriad of increasing and cumulative impacts on the Great Barrier Reef. We can control impacts such as fishing, coastal development and marine debris. However we do not have the same control over storms and cyclones,"" said Ove Hoegh-Guidberg, Catlin Seaview Survey's chief scientist. ""Ensuring that our coral can bounce back from these disturbances is at the heart of the matter,"" he said. The government says it's ""absolutely committed"" to protecting the Great Barrier Reef and is spending around $180 million dollars each year to improve the reef's health. However, it remains to be seen whether it's enough to protect what the environment minister has in the past called a ""vast and priceless ecosystem.""

"(CNN) -- The California teenager who defied laws and nature by surviving a plane ride to Hawaii as a stowaway in the wheel well says he remembers seeing the ocean from 38,000 feet above Earth. ""It was above the clouds, I could see through the little holes,"" Yahya Abdi, 15, of Santa Clara told CNN affiliate KPIX on Wednesday. In his first interview since sneaking into an airliner's wheel compartment in April, the boy from Somalia said he sneaked into the Maui-bound Boeing 767 in a scheme to see his mother in Africa, where she lives in a refugee camp in Ethiopia. Yahya planned for some time to sneak onto the tarmac of San Jose International Airport, and he finally hopped the airport fence on April 20 shortly after 1 a.m. After eluding detection for six hours, he finally chose a plane to crawl into -- randomly. ""I took that plane because it was the closest one I could find that was going to go west,"" Yahya told the news outlet in an online interview using Google Chat. That plane ride lasted five and a half hours, reaching an altitude of 38,000 feet where the oxygen is thin and temperatures fall below freezing. Yet, Yahya survived -- something he still has trouble believing. He was temporarily hospitalized in Hawaii after being discovered and caught. His defiance of airport security and danger drew national attention. The boy crouched in the wheel well as the airliner took off and covered his ears, he told the station. He sat on the inside of the plane's shell, and he told authorities that he lost consciousness during some of the flight. Yahya has since regained some of his hearing and is now in good physical condition. Before the boy became a stowaway, he became a runaway: He left his stepmother's home in April because he was unhappy there, he told the affiliate. His fleeing had nothing to do with his troubles at school, he said. ""I only did it because I didn't want to live with my stepmom. Second of all, I wanted to find my mom. I haven't seen her since I was young,"" the boy said. He last saw his mother when he was 7 years old. He misses her, and he spoke to her by phone on Tuesday, he told the news outlet. ""I would tell her to live with me in America,"" he said. A high school student who will be a junior next fall, Yahya is now staying at a temporary foster home and hopes to move soon to Minneapolis to live with an aunt, he told the affiliate. He wants to join the U.S. Army after graduation. But federal authorities haven't indicated yet whether they will allow the boy to board a plane to fly to Minnesota, KPIX reported. In the meantime, Yahya says he's enjoying typical teenager activities. ""I've been going to the movie theater and playing video games,"" he said. As for anyone thinking of repeating his amazing stunt, he has this advice. ""They shouldn't run away because sometimes they will end up dying,"" he told the affiliate.

"(CNN) -- First the Black Keys' Patrick Carney lit into Justin Bieber. Now he's taking on U2. The outspoken drummer, who said a few months ago that Bieber ""should be grateful that he has a f****** career in music,"" did not mince words when talking about the release of U2's latest, ""Songs of Innocence,"" as a free download from iTunes. The album's distribution ""devalued their music completely,"" Carney told The Seattle Times. It ""sends a huge mixed message to bands ... that are just struggling to get by. I think that they were thinking it's super generous of them to do something like that."" The U2 album was automatically downloaded into more than 500 million iTunes folders upon release September 9 -- pleasing some fans but angering others who didn't want the album in the first place. Bono later apologized for the inconvenience. ""I'm sorry about that,"" Bono said in a question-and-answer video posted this week on the band's Facebook page. ""I had this beautiful idea, but (we) got carried away with ourselves. Artists are prone to that kind of thing. A drop of megalomania, a touch of generosity, a dash of self-promotion and deep fear that these songs, that we poured our life into over the last few years, mightn't be heard."" Bono apologizes for free iTunes album . Apple observed that the album had been fully downloaded 26 million times and that 81 million people had listened to at least one song. Carney also defended the Keys' choice not to put their last two albums on Spotify. Artists aren't being fairly compensated, he said. (Cracker's David Lowery has made the same point about Pandora.) ""My whole thing about music is: If somebody's making money then the artist should be getting a fair cut of it,"" Carney said. Presumably referring to Spotify co-founder Sean Parker, he added, ""The owner of Spotify is worth something like 3 billion dollars ... he's richer than Paul McCartney and he's 30 and he's never written a song."" CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Patrick Carney is unhappy that U2 gave away ""Songs of Innocence"" for free .

"(CNN) -- Are your ears burning, Matthew McConaughey? Perhaps a particular shade of ... red? McConaughey lit a social media fire with comments about his favorite NFL team, the Washington Redskins. The capital's gridiron representatives -- and their owner, Dan Snyder -- have been criticized more heavily in recent years for keeping a name that is considered derogatory by many native Americans. ""I love the emblem. I dig it. It gives me a little fire and some oomph,"" McConaughey told GQ for its November issue. ""But now that it's in the court of public opinion, it's going to change. I wish it wouldn't, but it will."" The 44-year-old Texas native says he's been a Redskins fan since he was 4, when, ""watching Westerns, I always rooted for the Indians."" He also liked hamburgers, and the Skins had a player named Chris Hanburger, he added. McConaughey's words did not go unnoticed on Twitter. ""I wish ppl would stop saying 'everybody was fine with the Redskins' name, then all of a sudden...' I promise u, 'everybody' wasn't 'fine,' "" tweeted Stereo Williams. ""Matthew McConaughey wants the Redskins to keep their name, basically bc he digs the emblem & hamburgers,"" Emmy Weikert tweeted. But McConaughey also had defenders. ""Actor Matthew McConaughey Publicly Challenges Leftist Nonsense; Supports Washington REDSKINS!"" tweeted Hawkeye. A number of tweeters repeated a headline from the Independent Journal Review, a conservative viral news site: ""Guess Who Just Weighed in On the Redskins Logo Controversy with a Non-PC Take Some Sure Won't Like."" This isn't the first time McConaughey has defended the Redskins and his love for the team. In a June interview, McConaughey mentioned that he used to wear a headdress when attending Dallas-Washington games in Dallas. ""(Cowboys fans) didn't like that I would show up, painted in burgundy, with the headdress and stuff. But they didn't throw much stuff either. It was all right,"" he said. Comedian Hari Kondabolu believes he has a solution to the issue: keep the Redskins name but replace the logo with a severely sunburned white person. Suggestions, recorded on his Tumblr, have included Bob Barker, Dog the Bounty Hunter and Carrot Top. Dani, who describes herself as an ""urban Native American,"" thinks the two ideas can be combined. ""Matthew Mcconaughey stays looking sunburnt and like he rolled around in some cheetos. He could be the new Redskins mascot. #changethename,"" she tweeted.

The manner of her death has not yet been determined, the medical examiner's office said. Investigators found Upham's body during a search for the missing actress. It lay at the bottom of a steep embankment near the White River. Upham, 32, was last seen alive October 5 walking from her sister's apartment, according to a statement sent to media outlets by her father, Charles Upham. Authorities say she died that day, but it wasn't until more than a week later that investigators found her body. Her father said she had bipolar disorder and bouts of depression and anxiety, but he didn't think she was suicidal. Police have said they don't have evidence of foul play. Upham had small roles in ""Django Unchained"" and ""August: Osage County,"" and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her performance in 2008's ""Frozen River."" She's also had roles in the TV series ""Big Love"" and the TV movie ""Skinwalkers.""

"(CNN) -- Blood from Michael Brown that was found on the uniform and in the police car of Officer Darren Wilson appears to back the officer's version of events, but still leaves questions unanswered, law enforcement sources told CNN. Those sources corroborated to CNN details first reported by The New York Times about the officer's version of events in Wilson's shooting of the unarmed teen on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown's blood was found on Wilson's gun, on the squad car's interior and on the officer's uniform, according to a U.S. law enforcement official and a second source with knowledge of the forensics presented to the grand jury. The source corroborated what the Times reported. At least one of the wounds Brown suffered is consistent with a struggle and appeared to be fired at close range, according to a different source with first-hand knowledge of the investigation. This finding could lend credibility to Wilson's account that he was fearful for his life after a struggle with Brown in the police car. However, it is not necessarily a ""Eureka moment,"" the U.S. law enforcement official told CNN, adding it is just one data point in a larger investigation. The revelations do not answer the question of whether the officer intended to deprive Brown of his civil rights when he stepped out of the car and fired the fatal shot, the first law enforcement official said. According to the Times, the officer told authorities that Brown hit him and scratched him repeatedly, leaving bruises on his face and neck. FBI forensic tests showed the gun was fired twice in the car, with one bullet hitting Brown's arm while the second one missed, the newspaper said. The attorney for the family of the slain teen called again Monday for an indictment of Wilson. Attorney Daryl Parks said the new details shouldn't preclude Wilson's prosecution for the teen's death. ""If nothing else, you have two competing stories here,"" he said in an appearance on CNN's ""New Day."" He said leaks about the case are making people ""weary about the process"" and that only an open trial where all the facts are presented will help resolve lingering tensions over the shooting. Brown's death is the subject of two inquires: one by a St. Louis County grand jury considering whether the 28-year-old officer should be charged, and the other by federal investigators looking into whether any civil rights violations occurred. 'Helpful testimony' CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said the new account appears to be ""strong evidence"" favoring the officer, but ""the real focus on the case will shift to what happened outside of the car when Michael Brown ran away, according to many witnesses,"" Callan said. ""I think the focus will shift on the officer,"" Callan said. ""He is not out of the woods yet, even though this is helpful testimony for him."" Complete coverage of the Ferguson shooting and protests . But one critic of the government's response to Brown's shooting reacted angrily to the report. Angela Whitman, a Ferguson resident who was among activists meeting with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in August, found the newspaper account of Wilson's testimony ""so hard to believe."" She said the report addressed only the initial encounter and not the subsequent fatal shooting, when some witnesses said Brown was surrendering with his hands up. But police said Wilson shot Brown after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun. ""If (Michael Brown) struggled with this officer, this still does not justify why this child is not alive,"" Whitman said. ""If this young man did this, and struggled, that means he got free. And then witnesses said he turned around with his hands up. This kid should still be alive."" In an interview with CNN on Monday, Holder sought to manage expectations of activists in Ferguson, acknowledging the high standard investigators must meet, and the possibility there may not be any charges against Wilson. No particular outcome was promised, aside from a fair investigation and reform of the local police department, Holder noted. His promise to the people of Ferguson, Holder said, is to carry out an independent investigation, and a closer look at the police department itself. ""We have a 'pattern of practice' investigation going into the police department. So I think that we're doing all that we can with regard to the promises that I've made,"" Holder said. Witnesses' version a stark contrast . Most of the accounts of Brown's shooting have focused on what happened outside the car -- on the street -- with conflicting narratives. Dorian Johnson, 22, who was walking with Brown on the street when the shooting occurred, told CNN that the officer pulled up and told them to get on a sidewalk. They told him they were almost home and would be off the street shortly. The officer drove forward, but stopped and backed up, almost hitting the pair, Johnson said. ""We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer,"" he said. Still in his car, the officer grabbed Brown by his neck, but he tried to pull away as the officer pulled him toward him, Johnson said. The officer drew his weapon and fired, hitting Brown, Johnson said. A bloodied Brown took off running, but the officer followed him and fired, according to Johnson. Brown turned around with his hands up and told the officer he was unarmed, but the officer fired and the teen hit the ground, Johnson said. Another witness, Tiffany Mitchell, has said she saw Wilson and Brown ""tussling through the window"" of the police cruiser. CNN's Evan Perez, Pamela Brown, MaryLynn Ryan and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Nothing in a New York Times report would block prosecution, a Brown family attorney says .

"(CNN) -- Evangelical pastor Ted Haggard described Thursday as ""fundamentally true"" an assertion that he engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a 20-year-old male volunteer in 2006. Pastor Ted Haggard acknowledged on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that he had a second relationship with a man. The incident occurred when the two men were in bed together, Grant Haas said in a videotaped interview played on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""He pretty much asked me if it was OK if he masturbated in front of me or masturbated in the bed next to me,"" Haas said. ""I told him no, it would make me really uncomfortable. But he grabbed a bottle of lotion and started masturbating."" Haas added, ""(Haggard) used to say to me, 'You know what, Grant, you can become a man of God, and you can have a little bit of fun on the side."" Haggard, 52, said the incident was ""an indicator of the compulsive behavior"" that ruled him at the time. However, he said he has been undergoing therapy during the two years since and ""working it out.""  Watch Haggard accuser speak out » . Controversy involving Haggard first erupted in November 2006, when a former prostitute, Mike Jones, said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence. Haggard initially admitted in interviews that he received a massage from Jones but denied having sex with him. He also said he bought methamphetamine, but threw it away instead of using it. The assertions received widespread news coverage and sparked charges of hypocrisy, particularly because Haggard had condemned homosexual sex.  Watch Haggard address allegations on Oprah » . Haggard is the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which claims to represent millions of people in 45,000 congregations nationwide. He was also the head pastor at New Life Church. In a settlement with New Life, the church and Haggard agreed that he would retain his six-figure salary for a year, leave the Colorado Springs area, receive counseling and not speak publicly about what had happened for one year, according to a church staff member with knowledge of the settlement but who was not authorized to speak on the record. In the CNN interview, Haggard credited Jones with having helped him by disclosing that information. ""I think he rescued me. I'm very grateful to him,"" Haggard said. He said he would have lost the support of his wife of 30 years, Gail, and their five children ""and been a drug addict"" had he not been caught. ""I paid a heavy price. It was stupid,"" he said. Haggard likened his struggles with his desires to the struggles faced by dieters who say, ""'I'm not going to eat today' and then they eat."" ""Many of the charges against me are exaggerated, but it doesn't matter,"" Haggard told Larry King. ""I'm guilty enough of so many things."" He acknowledged that his actions were hypocritical, but said he could not control his urges. ""I felt like God's plan was for sexuality to be in a monogamous, heterosexual marriage,"" he said. ""I wanted that. But at the same time, I had these other things going on."" Haggard said he had thought that focusing on his spiritual life would help, but found that it did not. ""It actually made me worse,"" he said. Haggard said that, for a time, he lost the ability to read the Scriptures and became suicidal. ""I think it was divine intervention that stopped me,"" he said. Asked if he has engaged in inappropriate conduct with any other men, Haggard did not give a direct answer, saying only, ""I have thoroughly discussed all of my sexual history with my wife and my therapist and, to some degree, the family, and we think that's an appropriate boundary for that."" Asked whether he considers himself bisexual or gay, Haggard said that different therapists have described him in different ways. ""The first said, 'You are a heterosexual with homosexual attachments.' I wasn't sure what that meant."" His current therapist, he said, described him as ""a heterosexual with complications."" Haggard said he has, at least, another year of therapy ahead of him. ""I think I'm still deeply wounded and scarred and somewhat confused,"" he said. About other men, he added, ""I have thoughts from time to time, but not compelling thoughts."" Nevertheless, he said, ""Today, I'm 100 percent satisfied with my relationship with my wife, and I have no compelling things in my life toward others."" He said he initially urged his wife to leave him, but she refused. ""I really do love this man,"" she told CNN when asked why she did not leave. But it was also her faith that led her to stick with the marriage, she said. ""The teaching of Jesus is that we forgive and that we love."" She said the two had ""a great sexual relationship in our marriage ... throughout marriage."" Though the news of his unfaithfulness came as a shock, it wasn't completely out of the blue, she said. ""I knew that Ted had some struggles in this area, particularly in his thoughts. I never knew that he acted on them."" Marcus Haggard, the couple's 25-year-old son, said he, too, was shocked by the revelations, but was more disturbed to learn that his father had lied. Still, he said the news brought the family closer together. ""He had lived so long on a pedestal,"" Marcus Haggard said about his famous father. ""He seemed practically perfect. There was a sense of relief in the fact that we could connect with our dad."" Asked if he wants to return to the pulpit, Haggard said, ""I think Gail and I both want to tell our story to the degree that it's helpful to other people. I don't know that that would mean a pulpit, but certainly I'd be interested in public speaking.""

"Paris (CNN) -- French police arrested two veiled women protesting the country's law banning face-hiding Islamic burqas and niqabs Monday, just hours after the legislation took effect. The arrests outside Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris were not for wearing the prohibited garments. Police say the women were instead arrested for participating in an unauthorized protest. But the incident reflected the high passions the ban has incited among some Muslims. One woman who disapproves of the ban said no one forces her to wear the niqab, a full-face veil with an opening for her eyes, and she should be left alone. ""I've not committed a crime,"" said Hind Amas, who was not among those arrested. ""I'm walking peacefully in the street. I've not attacked anyone."" The ban pertains to the burqa, a full-body covering that includes a mesh over the face, as well as the niqab. The hijab, which covers the hair and neck but not the face, and the chador, which covers the body but not the face, apparently are not banned by the law that has sparked a vigorous debate around freedom of religion in France. ""The ban does not target the wearing of a headscarf, head gear, scarf or glasses, as long as the accessories do not prevent the person from being identified,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon last month defended the ban as being in keeping with national values. ""The French Republic lives in a bare-headed fashion,"" he said in an official government newspaper explaining the law. The legislation was largely the product of internal French politics, with President Nicolas Sarkozy's center-right party seeking to defend its flank against a more hard-line right wing, said Jonathan Laurence, an associate professor of political science at Boston College and the author of an upcoming book, ""The Emancipation of Europe's Muslims."" ""It's an unnecessary confrontation,"" he said. ""This is not an epidemic."" Fewer than 2,000 people in all of France and its possessions wear the garments, he said -- a quarter of them overseas. The now forbidden garments are not popular among the North African Muslims who make up much of France's Islamic population. But the law should not be interpreted as France turning unfriendly toward the largest Muslim population in Western Europe, he said. As its Muslim population has risen over the past decade France has gone to great lengths to ensure accommodations for Muslims. A council on Islamic faith helped guide changes such as increasing the number of clergy in prisons and the military and streamlining the approval of slaughterhouses to provide meat that adheres to Islamic law, according to Laurence. And unrest among French Muslim immigrants has had more to do with economics than cultural issues, Laurence said. ""France is not a bad place for Muslims to live,"" he said, predicting that controversy over the law would pass if France continued its commitment to supporting the needs of Muslims to worship freely in the country. But such policies could frustrate French Muslims, said Amer Sahar, a professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who studies Muslims in France. ""The French community has, of course, been upset at this new development even if many may personally be against the burqa,"" she said. ""They feel under attack one more time and resentful of the fact that they are not allowed to be both Muslim and French."" Hebah Ahmed, a blogger, is against the ban and says it is a woman's choice whether or not to cover up. ""I am free to do whatever I want and this is a choice that I want to make. And just because somebody doesn't accept my interpretation of Islam or personally like it doesn't mean that we can use laws to violate people's freedom of expression and freedom of religion,"" she said on CNN's ""In the Arena."" ""People have to deal with my brain and who I really am and not judge me by my body,"" she added. The law imposes a fine of 150 euros (currently about $215). The person breaking the law can be asked to carry out public service duty as part of the punishment or as an alternative to the fine. It was passed in October but included a six-month period to inform people of the penalty before it went into effect. Penalties for forcing a person to wear a burqa are part of the law, and they became effective immediately in October. Forcing a woman to wear a niqab or a burqa is punishable by a year in prison and a 30,000-euro fine (about $43,300). Forcing a minor to do the same thing is punishable by two years in prison and a fine of 60,000 euros. The government has called such coercion ""a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil."" Activist Rachid Nekkaz of the group Hands Off My Constitution headed out Monday wearing a mask and carrying a check for the 150-euro fine. Nekkaz's group auctioned one of his homes to provide money to pay the fines of any woman arrested for wearing the forbidden garments. ""I would like to send a clear message to President Nicolas Sarkozy that we can do what we want. We have rules. We have a constitution and everyone has to respect it,"" he said. The French Constitutional Council said the law does not impose disproportionate punishments or prevent the free exercise of religion in a place of worship, finding therefore that ""the law conforms to the Constitution."" ""Given the damage it (wearing the forbidden clothing) produces on those rules which allow the life in community, ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes, this practice, even if it is voluntary, cannot be tolerated in any public place,"" the French government said when it sent the measure to parliament in May of last year. Lawmakers have also cited security reasons for forbidding people from covering their faces in public. Some Muslim women support the ban, including Sihem Habachi. ""When you wear the full veil, you don't have the right to work, you don't have the right to choose your husband, you don't have the right to love,"" said Habachi, a Muslim feminist. ""You are totally in prison. What is the aim of our democracy? What is the aim of our republic? It is to protect. That is a new challenge for our republic today."" Mona Eltahawy, a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues, similarly supports the ban and says she would like to see it adopted elsewhere. ""I believe that the niqab dangerously equates piety with the disappearance of women so I support banning it anywhere,"" she said on CNN's ""In the Arena."" ""We're talking about the disappearance of women, justified in the name of them becoming closer to God."" Despite the controversy, French people backed the ban by a ratio of more than 4-to-1, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found in a survey last year. Some 82 percent of people polled approved of a ban, while 17 percent disapproved. That was the widest support the Washington-based think tank found in any of the five countries it surveyed. Clear majorities also backed a burqa ban in Germany, Britain and Spain, while two out of three Americans opposed it, the survey found. Amnesty International had repeatedly urged France not to impose the ban, saying it violates European human rights law. The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimates that France has about 3.5 million Muslims, or about 6% of the population. France does not keep its own statistics on religious affiliation of the population, in keeping with its laws requiring the state to be strictly secular.

"(CNN) -- As details about an alleged assault of Rihanna by her boyfriend, Chris Brown, emerged, fans and the entertainment industry grappled with what it could mean for the future of the young star's career. Singer Chris Brown appears in court on Thursday on charges he allegedly assaulted his girlfriend, singer Rihanna. Authorities charged Brown, 19, on Thursday with felony counts of assault and making criminal threats, the Los Angeles County, California, District Attorney's Office said. If convicted, the sentence could range from probation to four years and eight months in prison, officials said. Brown appeared before a judge on Thursday, but the arraignment was delayed for a month at the request of his attorney. Twenty-one-year-old Rihanna was allegedly attacked by Brown on a Los Angeles street before their scheduled performances at the Grammy Awards on February 8. Message boards across the Internet were abuzz with reaction after the sworn statement by Los Angeles Police Detective DeShon Andrews surfaced. The statement painted a brutal picture of what allegedly happened in the early morning hours of February 8.  Watch Brown at his court appearance » . ""Robyn F. [Rihanna's real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty] turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand,"" the affidavit stated. ""He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle."" Emil Wilbekin, editor-in-chief of GIANT Magazine, said some readers were expressing outrage at Brown's alleged actions on postings at the GIANT Web site, writing that they hope Brown gets jail time and that justice is served. ""In Chris Brown's case, there are two things going on,"" Wilbekin said. ""The first is that Chris is such a clean-cut young man and so this is a very shocking turn of events, because it's completely against what we know of his entertainment persona. ""The second part is that both [Rihanna and Brown] have very young female fans.""  Listen to the reaction of fans on HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight"" » . Brown, a native of small-town Tappahannock, Virginia, made the music scene with his 2005 debut album and the single, ""Run It!"", which quickly topped the Billboard music chart. His good looks and athletic dance moves quickly rocketed him to teen idol status and he solidified that reputation with a successful follow-up album, movie and TV appearances and a Grammy nominated duet with ""American Idol"" winner Jordan Sparks. Stories of troubled singers are nothing new to the entertainment industry. Many artists, including Whitney Houston and Britney Spears, have been able to survive the negative press and emerge with many fans still intact. But industry insiders like Wilbekin point out that there is a marked difference between self-destructive behavior and allegedly causing harm to another person. iReport: Share your reaction to the Chris Brown allegations . Even though Brown issued a brief apology for the incident, Wilbekin said he believes the entertainer has been hurt by the silence emanating from his camp. ""He still has not made [an extensive] statement to the public, and particularly because a lot of his fans are young women, that's not going to go over well,"" Wilbekin said. ""I think the fact that he's not come clean about it, which I understand for legal reasons, is an issue. Not saying anything at all is not helpful, especially not for his career."" Joann Killeen, president of Killeen Furtney Group, knows a bit about crisis communications -- her marketing and public relations firm initially represented California octuplet mom Nadya Suleman before later dropping her as a client -- and agrees that silence is not always golden. Killeen said Brown's representatives may have erred by waiting a week before issuing a statement. ""By then everybody had an idea and a vision as to what happened,"" she said. ""Unfortunately if you don't speak and frame the issue, state what happened, state the facts that you know, someone else is going to do it for you and you lose your position of being proactive and owning the story."" While she points out that America loves a comeback story -- like actor Robert Downey Jr., who was nominated for an Academy Award this year after multiple drug-related arrests in the past -- Killeen said the public can be much more forgiving about drug abuse than domestic violence. ""I think it's going to take a concerted effort on [Brown's] part to be very vocal about asking not only Rihanna for forgiveness, but he has to convince America that he's really going to work on resolving his anger issues and putting his life back together,"" Killeen said. Despite the charges, some fans are vowing to take a wait-and-see approach. ""I'm sure there are people out there that feel betrayed,"" said twentysomething Brown fan Kadija White of Capital Heights, Maryland. ""But there are probably some people like me who still are going to like his music."" However, Devi Dev, who does the entertainment segment on urban radio station 93.5 KDAY in Los Angeles, said listeners have been extremely vocal in their support for Rihanna and their sadness at the incident. ""A lot of the ladies are just like 'I feel so bad for her. Leave him girl, leave him' and the guys are being very defensive, saying women hit men, too,"" said Dev. If Brown has any hope of surviving this, he is going to have to completely reinvent himself as an artist who appeals to older fans, Dev said. ""His fan base is teenage girls and the fact that he allegedly hit a young woman, his fan base is completely gone,"" she said. ""No parent is going to want to support their child listening to his music or buying his music.""","Many question whether Chris Brown's career can survive felony charges .

"(CNN)  -- Liverpool new boy Joe Cole was sent off for the first time in his professional career in a 1-1 draw against Arsenal in their English Premier League opener on Sunday at Anfield. Despite being down to 10 men, Liverpool took a 46th minute lead through David Ngog, but were denied victory by a Pepe Reina own goal in injury time. Cole, who joined Liverpool after being released by champions Chelsea, was sent off for a two-footed lunge on Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny just before half-time of the heavyweight encounter. Referee Martin Atkinson had no hesitation in giving Cole his marching orders as Koscielny, a summer capture by Arsene Wenger from Lorient, appeared to be seriously injured by the scything challenge. But he came out for the second half to ironic cheers from the home fans, who had the last laugh when Koscielny was himself sent off for a second yellow card on the stroke of the final whistle. Arsenal had the better of a cagey first half and with Liverpool down to 10 men were expected to take advantage, but fell behind straight after the break. Javier Mascherano, who is set to leave Liverpool, played in Ngog who crashed the ball past Manuel Almunia at his near post and high into the net. Liverpool fans were cheered by the second half appearance of substitute Fernando Torres, but he had few glimpses of goal as Arsenal pressed for an equalizer. Thomas Vermaelen headed wide and substitute Tomas Rosicky forced Reina into a brilliant fingertip save. But soon afterwards the Spanish international was shaking his head after an uncharacteristic error gifted Arsenal their equalizer. Under challenge from Marouane Chamakh, Reina dropped the ball but appeared to have got away with his mistake until the ball hit the post and he fumbled the rebound, allowing it to cross the line. There was still time for Steven Gerrard to force Almunia into a fine save from a free kick and for Koscielny to be booked twice, the second for deliberate handball, to be shown a late, late red. New Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson told Sky Sports that he was a ""little bit disappointed,"" that his team had not held out for three points but hailed his side's resilience. ""It was a remarkable performance to have come so close to victory after playing all of the second half with 10 men,"" he added.","Liverpool and Arsenal draw 1-1 in English Premier League opener at Anfield .

"(CNN) -- I dreaded the Ferguson grand jury response for weeks. Not simply because I knew it was likely to lead to more heartache and unrest for the black community -- my community -- but because it would most certainly dredge up deep internal conflict for me. I'm raising a black boy to be a black man. So the grand jury's decision seems to double down on a pattern in this country of killing black boys without care or consequences. But I'm raising my black son with my black husband, who also happens to be a police officer in Washington. And being the wife of an officer means I can't support either camp fully -- neither the outraged black community nor the justice system sworn to protect us. When my husband first donned his uniform nearly 10 years ago, I told him clearly and directly: ""You do whatever you must to come home to me."" Nearly a decade and three children later, he's heeded that order, navigating the dangers that only populate my nightmares -- just to make sure he comes home. The irony isn't lost on me. I know what the research says. I know that this country often denies agency to African-American boys, and that they're often seen as a threat just by virtue of their skin color. Opinion: Justice system unfair to minorities . But in moments such as this, it's the denial of agency to law enforcement officers that angers me. All cops aren't bad. All cops aren't racist. Many cops have spouses and children. They have loved ones and friends and pets. They leave all this every day to place themselves in harm's way for people they never meet. They love their communities. They want the law of the land to work as it's supposed to. They don't like to see children hurt, people taken advantage of. They are people doing a job that few are brave enough to take on. So when I heard St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCullough describe how Michael Brown allegedly lunged at Officer Darren Wilson in his police car, I knew it was likely that my husband could have responded the same way: shoot to disable the threat. Do what he must to make it home to us at night. This is part of my reality. It's how I process these incidents now. But it was also my reality when, as we sped home to relieve our sitter one night, my husband and I were pulled over by a police officer on a dark, wooded parkway in Virginia. And I watched my husband, an officer for nearly 10 years, immediately turn off the car, turn on all the interior lights, place the keys on the dashboard and put his hands on the steering wheel. Opinion: Ferguson shows failure at every level . He turned to me, calmly and coolly, and said, ""Get our insurance card out. Don't make any sudden moves, and leave your hands on your lap."" I froze. I teared up, and fear welled up as a lump in my throat. Because that night, before he was an officer, my husband was a black man. Like Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and Oscar Grant. These conflicting parts of my reality are why the South Carolina state trooper shooting earlier this year isn't, to me, a black-and-white case of excessive force used by white law enforcement on an unarmed black teenager. And it's why I've not waded into the debate waters on Michael Brown either. Because I need my husband and his colleagues to make it home. Every night. So I can't ""like"" many of the stirring posts I scroll through on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter. I can't post my own rants of outrage at the failings of our justice system, nor can I post any statement that might be interpreted as in support of the Ferguson officer. Not because I can't connect to them or feel them on some level, but because it's complicated. And complicated in a way that no one seems to respect or acknowledge or care to understand.","Safiya Jafari Simmons say her husband is a police officer and she's raising a black boy .

"Lake Victoria, Uganda (CNN) -- Straddling three East African countries -- Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya -- Lake Victoria has for centuries been a vital resource for the millions of people living along its vast coastline. The massive lake, which stretches some 70,000 square kilometers, is the world's second-biggest freshwater body and the biggest of its kind in Africa, as well as the chief reservoir of the Nile. Home to a stunning archipelago of more than 80 islands, Lake Victoria provides a livelihood for the fishermen navigating its waters and the businesses dotting its shores. But for many that comes with a risk. According to local officials, about 5,000 people are killed every year on the lake, victims of erratic weather conditions and a mix of poor communications and lack of resources. The high death toll makes the lake ""arguably the most dangerous stretch of water in the world in terms of fatalities per square kilometer,"" according to The National Lake Rescue Institute, a group launched in 2002 to improve safety on Lake Victoria and provide education and training in maritime safety. See also: 'Hippie apes' battle for survival . ""It's very dangerous,"" says Sam Kabonge, a fisherman from the Bugala island in Lake Victoria, a tropical patch of land boasting sandy shores and lush forests. ""You sit on top of water not knowing the depth of the pitch you are sitting on so in any case of accident ... even if you do [know how to swim], you might be far away in the lake."" Kabonge says not all fishermen can afford life jackets. At the same time, their small and often dilapidated vessels can easily succumb to the wind-whipped waves formed in the lake by its volatile microclimate. ""There are times when you may leave the landing site when the lake is still,"" explains Kabonge. ""As you are in the middle of it, it starts getting rough -- rain, winds, clouds, and you know what happens next because ... our boats, cannot resist the strength of the wave. Sometimes they break; others capsize."" See also: School boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . Ugandan meteorologist Khalid Muwembe says the lake, which lies on the Equator, has a distinct effect on the region's weather. ""Because the lake is generally warm and has a lot of moisture, we find that it generates this very big, what we call, convective potential energy, which generates a lot of cloudness and this unique nature of weather characterized by heavy thunderstorms which sometimes can be dangerous,"" he explains. Muwembe is part of a team testing a new mobile alert system aiming to improve the delivery of weather forecasts and help vulnerable fishing communities in Lake Victoria protect themselves from dangerous conditions. Under the free pilot program, locals receive tailor-made text messages on their mobile phones, providing them with daily weather forecasts, warnings about potential hazards and advice on what action they should take. See also: Wildlife puts Tanzania on the tourist map . Muwembe says the mobile alert weather system is helping fishermen to plan safer outings. ""For a long period of time, we didn't have a very good weather service to try and guide and promote safety of all those navigating over the lake,"" he says. ""So because of that -- and also daily reports of accidents over the lake -- we thought it was very important that we have a weather system where we are giving the users of the small vessels over the lake at least some guidance on what kind of storms they expect to find over the lake."" ""We provide this information on a daily basis as texts on their mobile phones and in a situation where we see that there is a very dangerous storm which is developing, we also give them an additional message, which we call an alert. We say that 'this is happening, please take action, or hold position,' or whatever it is that will at least promote safety,"" he adds. For fishermen like Kabonge, who is among those involved in the pilot program, the localized weather information is a vital service that can help people in the community stay safe. ""We need it because ever since it came, at least the death tolls have reduced,"" says Kabonge, who calls for the program's expansion. ""The lake is too wide -- if it [the program] could go across the whole lake, our brothers also may get use of it."" And for Kabonge that is what is most important -- to use new technology to help protect the lives of Lake Victoria's fishermen. See also: Flower power threatens Kenya's Lake Victoria .

"(CNN) -- Garth Brooks, one of the biggest country stars of all time, said Thursday he is coming out of retirement after nine years away from the music business, and will start a concert engagement in Las Vegas. Garth Brooks performs during inaugural festivities in Washington in January. Brooks made the announcement at a press conference at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, followed later in the day by a second press conference at the Wynn Las Vegas hotel after flying an entourage of media from Nashville. At the Wynn, he announced he had agreed to a ""series of special engagements,"" as a press release phrased it. How it came about depended who you asked. ""Steve asked me to come out here,"" Brooks, wearing his traditional black cowboy hat, told the audience of reporters in Las Vegas, as he sat next to casino owner Steve Wynn on an auditorium stage. (Earlier, Wynn said Brooks had approached him.) Brooks sampled a room Wynn had suggested, putting on a show for more than 1,000 people, and said he was unsure about settling in for a long-term arrangement. ""I told him he couldn't afford me -- I was wrong,"" Brooks said.  Watch Brooks talk about his decision to come out of retirement » . Brooks has three daughters -- 17, 15 and 13 -- to whom he's devoted, and he told Wynn he wanted to make sure he was home in Oklahoma to be with his children until the last one graduates from high school. So Wynn got Brooks a plane; the singer will work one show Fridays, two shows on Saturdays and one Sundays, and be back home for Monday morning. ""Did I tell you about the plane?"" Brooks asked, more than once, when reporters inquired how he would pull things off. The Vegas engagement is not a kickoff to a tour, according to spokeswoman Nancy Seltzer. ""If he tours again, it still won't be until his youngest goes to college,"" Seltzer told CNN via text message. Brooks stressed that situation at the press conference. He won't be recording new albums or touring, he said: ""The only place you'll see me is here."" Brooks, 47, was one of country's biggest stars in the 1990s. His albums, including ""Ropin' the Wind,"" ""The Chase"" and ""In Pieces,"" sold in excess of 100 million copies, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Brooks also was renowned for his concerts, which were energetic affairs in which he drove himself and his band hard. Brooks has had his missteps, most notably a 1999 concept album credited to an alter ego rock singer, Chris Gaines. Though the album received positive reviews, his traditional audience didn't know what to make of it, and the rock audience didn't respond. A film about the life of Chris Gaines was shelved. Brooks announced his retirement in 2000, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. His last album of new material, ""Scarecrow,"" came out in 2001, though he's lent his voice to occasional tribute singles and concerts, including a performance for President Obama's inauguration festivities this year. Brooks is married to fellow country singer Trisha Yearwood, whom he wed in 2005. Brooks will work at the Wynn Las Vegas 15 weekends a year. Every three months or so, Brooks said, he'll make a decision about continuing and exactly which weekends. ""As innocent and as simple as this business can be, is what this deal is,"" Brooks said. Tickets will cost $125 a seat, Wynn said. The first show will be December 11. Tickets go on sale October 24.

"(CNN)  -- A brutal Maoist guerrilla group that terrorized Peru during the 1980s but pretty much disappeared when top leaders were captured in the 1990s is making a resurgence. Police in Lima, Peru, carry coffins of officers killed in a November ambush by suspected Shining Path rebels. In the latest of several recent attacks by the Sendero Luminoso, known in English as the Shining Path, 14 government soldiers were killed in an ambush this month. It was, a Sendero leader said afterward, ""the strongest blow"" against the government in quite a while. It also was not an isolated incident. ""It's like that horror movie, 'Friday the 13th,' "" said Bernard Aronson, President George H.W. Bush's assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs from 1989 to 1993. ""You think you've killed the beast, and the beast returns."" Sendero declared war on the government in 1980, carrying out bombings and assassinations that by official accounts killed more than 30,000 Peruvians during the next 20 years. Another 30,000 Peruvians died at the hands of the government and paramilitary groups in the fight against the Sendero, a government commission determined in 2003. In the countryside of central and southern Peru where the rebels were strongest, Sendero waged an assassination campaign against government officials, the heads of state-owned farming collectives, business owners and even peasants who opposed the guerrillas. Political rivals, including other Marxists or leftists, were not immune either. Sendero also conducted daring attacks in Lima, the capital. Rebels blew up electrical transmission towers to cause citywide blackouts, bombed factories and set off explosives near government offices and inside the ruling party's political headquarters. Assassinations were carried out with seeming impunity on the streets of Lima. ""They terrorized Peru,"" said Alvin Adams, a former U.S. ambassador to Venezuela and the State Department's associate coordinator for counterterrorism from 1987 to 1989. In a sign of how desperate the situation had become, then-President Alberto Fujimori suspended the constitution in 1992. Peruvian officials now say Fujimori took the war against the Sendero too far, and he was convicted this year of human rights abuses. A turning point came in September 1992, when the government captured Sendero leader Abimael Guzman in a Lima apartment. Authorities, who had been watching the apartment, found empty vials of psoriasis medicine in his garbage and knew they had found their man. Guzman, a former university philosophy professor, was known to suffer from the skin ailment and had come into the city from his jungle hideout to seek treatment. The arrests of other top leaders in the 1990s seemed to ensure the demise of the group, which had split into two factions. Sendero attacks continued sporadically, but the guerrillas seemed destined for the back pages of history, as their numbers and effectiveness diminished. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Sendero was believed to have about 5,000 guerrillas. By 2002, analysts estimated that the group had about 200 members. But Sendero, which always had worked closely with many of Peru's estimated 300,000 coca growers and drug traffickers, was far from dead. In the early part of this decade, the U.S. State Department and others warned of a possible resurgence. That warning appears to have come to fruition. Perhaps most famously, Sendero set off a bomb outside the U.S. Embassy in Lima in March 2002, a few days before President George W. Bush was to visit. Nine people died and 30 were injured. In a June 2003 attack on a jungle labor camp, rebels took about 70 workers hostage and demanded a large ransom. The workers were recovered safely, but there were conflicting reports on whether a ransom was paid. ""I've been watching them reappear now with a sense of dread ... like dying embers that have been brought back to life,"" said retired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who was drug policy director for President Clinton. Yonah Alexander, a senior fellow at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies and director of its International Center for Terrorism Studies, said, ""The left-wing terrorists are still alive and kicking."" Aronson, the former assistant secretary of state, said he wonders whether Sendero is as strong as it was 20 years ago. ""It's unclear whether this is just a localized version of Sendero or a movement that has some legs,"" he said. Nonetheless, he added, the situation is ""worrisome."" Although Sendero was never popular with Peruvians, Alexander sees an ideological bent to the resurgence. ""You can arrest someone,"" he said. ""You can kill someone. But you can't kill an idea."" And that idea, Alexander, Aronson and others say, has its roots in poor economic conditions and the lack of social justice. ""The mission that Sendero tried to communicate for a very long time is back there because circumstances changed. The circumstances are right for striking for social and economic reasons,"" Alexander said, adding, ""I was surprised it didn't happen before."" McCaffrey in large part blames the Peruvian government. ""The problem is the country doesn't work very well,"" he said. ""Eighty-five percent of the people are living in rudimentary conditions. They look at their government and say. 'There's no justice here.' "" Sendero's renewed life, McCaffrey said, ""is a comment on the incompetence, the goofiness of the Peruvian government."" Aronson sees a ""resurgence of the left in Latin America partly because of the economic crisis."" At the heart of Sendero's power lies its alliance with Peru's drug trade, which often pays the guerrillas for security, intelligence and logistics. Marxist guerrillas in Colombia known as the FARC have struck a similar alliance with that country's narcotraffickers. McCaffrey calls it ""a convergence between terrorism and crime."" The drug trade in Peru, he said, ""produces a mountain of cash, and Sendero will exploit that."" Aronson reiterated a point that U.S. officials have made before: The war on drugs cannot be separated from the fight against terrorism. ""It just shows why fighting drugs isn't just about fighting drugs,"" Aronson said. ""It's about combating forces of violence that are attacking democracy."" And he and others said the Sendero has been allowed to get back in the game because the United States was not paying much attention, distracted in part by the September 11, 2001, attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""This shows why we have to continue to pay attention and be involved in Latin America in a strong way,"" Aronson said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A drug addiction expert who testified that Michael Jackson suffered a ""quite extensive"" drug addiction acknowledged there was no evidence the singer used more painkillers than medically necessary. Dr. Petros Levounis testified Tuesday and Wednesday for AEG Live in its defense of the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and children. Lawyers for the concert promoter want to convince jurors that the singer was a secretive addict responsible for his own death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. Their executives had no way of knowing the singer was in danger when he was preparing for his comeback concerts in 2009, they contend. Jackson lawyers contend AEG Live executives are liable because they negligently hired, retained or supervised the doctor who used propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia as he prepared for his comeback concerts during the last two months of his life. The conclusion that Jackson was dependent on painkillers was not a revelation, considering Jackson himself announced it when he cut his ""Dangerous"" tour short to enter a rehab program in 1993. ""If he announced it to the world it's not very private, is it?"" Jackson lawyer Michael Koskoff asked Levounis. ""At that moment, he was not secretive,"" Levounis replied. Jackson's drugs of choice were opioids, painkillers given to him by doctors repairing scalp injuries suffered in a fire and during cosmetic procedures to make him look younger, Levounis testified. Labeling Jackson an addict could tarnish the singer's image among jurors, but its relevance to AEG Live's liability is questionable. Opioids played no role in Jackson's death, according to the Los Angeles County coroner. His June 25, 2009, death was ruled a result of an overdose of propofol. Dr. Conrad Murray told investigators he infused the singer with propofol for 60 consecutive nights to treat his insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals. The judge would not allow Levounis to testify if he thought Jackson was addicted to propofol. Anesthesiologist: Jackson recruited me to help with insomnia . Levounis said addiction happens when a chemical ""hijacks the pleasure-reward pathways"" in your brain. ""You remain addicted for the rest of your life,"" Levounis testified. ""Michael Jackson's addiction was quite extensive and I have very little doubt that his pleasure-reward pathways had been hijacked and he suffered from addiction,"" he said. Levounis conceded he saw no evidence that Jackson used painkillers after he left rehab in 1993 until 2001 or between July 2003 and late 2008. He said it is not inconsistent for an addiction to go into remission. Under cross examination Wednesday morning, Levounis conceded that he never saw evidence that Jackson injected himself with narcotics, ever sought or used illegal drugs such as cocaine, meth or heroin, or abused drugs to produce euphoria or get high. There was also no evidence Jackson used more painkillers than doctors prescribed, he said. Jackson lawyers have never disputed the singer's drug dependence. In fact, they contend that AEG Live executives, including one who was Jackson's tour manager when he entered rehab, were negligent for paying a doctor $150,000 a month just to treat Jackson. The high salary created a conflict for the debt-ridden Murray, making it difficult for him to say no to Jackson's demands for drugs. Paul Gongaware, the AEG Live co-CEO who was in charge of Jackson's 2009 ""This Is It"" tour, was also tour manager for his ""Dangerous"" tour in 1993. Levounis acknowledged in testimony Wednesday that there was evidence that Gongaware knew about Jackson's painkiller addiction 15 years before his death. Levounis' testimony about the dangers of a doctor being too friendly with an addicted patient, which he said Murray was, could help the Jacksons' case. ""A very close friendship between an addicted patient and a doctor is problematic,"" Levounis testified. ""It makes it much easier for a patient to ask for drugs and it makes it more difficult for a provider to resist."" The medical records of Murray's treatment of Jackson between 2006 and 2008 -- when the singer lived in Las Vegas -- showed no painkillers prescribed during seven visits. Murray's notes did show he treated Jackson's complaints of insomnia with a sedative in 2008. Wednesday was the 76th day of testimony in the trial, which is expected to conclude near the end of September.","NEW: Expert saw no evidence Jackson ever sought or used illegal drugs .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in Washington state on Tuesday unsealed an indictment for airplane theft against an alleged teenage criminal known as ""the barefoot bandit."" According to the indictment, Colton Harris-Moore, 19, stole an aircraft last year in Idaho and flew it to Washington state, where authorities found it crashed. DNA evidence and fingerprints linked Harris-Moore to the plane theft, the indictment states. The elusive fugitive is suspected in previous thefts of small planes. In the most recent case, a small high-performance plane stolen from an Indiana airport over the weekend was found in shallow waters off an island in the Bahamas, officials said, and the details surrounding the incident have people wondering if the ""barefoot bandit"" was involved. Now, the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. An FBI statement indicated that agents believe Harris-Moore was involved in the Indiana theft, with the statement saying, ""Should you see  Harris-Moore in The Bahamas, please contact the nearest Royal Bahamas Police  Force Station."" After spending years on the run along the West Coast, Harris-Moore had surfaced in recent weeks in the Midwest, police said. Bruce Payton, director of Monroe County Airport in Bloomington, Indiana, told CNN a 2009 Cessna 400 Corvalis was reported missing on July 4. Payton said the plane was taken from a locked hanger inside an area surrounded by a 12-foot-tall barbed wire fence. ""We've never had an airplane stolen from this airport before, not to my knowledge,"" Payton told CNN, ""and I've been here since 1978."" He said the owner of the aircraft was contacted by the U.S. Coast Guard and was told that the emergency locator transmitter for the Cessna was sending out a beacon off the coast of an island in the Bahamas. Payton said the sheriff's department contacted him on June 30 and said a stolen vehicle had been recovered near the airport. ""The details associated with the stolen vehicle fit the M.O. of the person known as the barefoot bandit,"" he said the authorities told him. Harris-Moore was dubbed the barefoot bandit because he allegedly broke into homes in Oregon and Washington without shoes. Police suspect he may also have stolen boats and cars in addition to airplanes. Over the past month, the teen has been linked to a string of thefts and break-ins in South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa, police said. Authorities said Harris-Moore may have broken into two airports: Chan Gurney in Yankton, South Dakota, and Karl Stefan Memorial in Norfolk, Nebraska. After authorities told him about the possible connection between the recovered stolen vehicle and the barefoot bandit, Payton said, ""I made several contacts with the state Indiana Aviation Association and asked them to put out a bulletin to all airports."" But he said any ""uncontrolled"" airport would be vulnerable to an airplane thief. ""We're a general aviation airport, a corporate-class general aviation airport,"" Payton said. ""Our air traffic control is not manned 24 hours per day. We have a controlled airspace from 6:30 in the morning until 9:30 p.m. Aircraft can still go from this area and operate under federal aviation rules as they do at all uncontrolled airports."" ""The bigger question people should be asking,"" Payton said, ""is how could an airplane fly from Bloomington, Indiana, and fly across states and airspaces and international waters and never be detected?"" Harris-Moore has become an outlaw hero to tens of thousands of people who have joined a Facebook tribute page. Jim Tillman, a retired pilot and aviation expert, said his alleged crime spree should not be romanticized. ""This kid is a punk. He's a brat who is breaking laws all over the place."" Tillman told CNN. ""You are dealing with a thief who is violating federal law and endangering anybody on the ground. There is no glamour in this, none whatsoever."" Tillman said that it ""wouldn't be too difficult for Harris-Moore to fly the plane to the Bahamas. Flying an airplane is not as tough to do as a lot of people would like to think it is, but it isn't like stealing a car. You've got an airplane moving over 200 knots, it's got a whole bunch of gasoline on board, it's just dangerous."" Tillman said many pilots are not required to file flight plans. ""As long as you don't fly in restricted areas, around airports, military institutions,"" he said. He also had a message for those who may idolize Harris-Moore for his alleged escapades. ""He's just an idiot pushing his luck"" said Tillman.","NEW: ""Barefoot bandit"" indicted for theft of a plane last year .

"(CNN) -- For most of us, hotel pillows are an afterthought. It takes a night of compromised sleeping positions and desperate pillow kneading in an attempt to create matter where none exists to highlight their actual significance. But there's much to know about these under-appreciated accoutrements of the travel biz. As Keith Pierce, executive vice president for brand operations at Wyndham Hotel Group told us, ""There's more to pillows than just pillows."" Like what? Glad you asked. 1. That annoying pillow tag? It fought smallpox . The tags attached to pillows and comforters in the United States that list the exact percentages of fills, be they foam or down? According to the International Association of Bedding and Furniture Law Officials, it's known as a law label. While it might seem like government red tape, it's actually a product of the 1800s when some less-than-scrupulous business people were stuffing their pillows and mattresses with old hospital blankets that might have carried smallpox and tuberculosis. Sleep tight. And smallpox free! 2. Your hotel pillow is probably younger than the one you have at home . According to Kris Beck at Hilton Worldwide, a synthetic pillow lasts approximately 18 to 24 months when cared for and laundered properly, while a down or feather pillow can last 24 to 36 months. Keith Pierce from Wyndham says that pillows at Microtel locations -- the budget arm of the Wyndham Hotel Group -- last less than 24 months, with properties replacing a third of their inventory every 6 to 8 months. For Microtel, that means a purchase of 20,000 pillows in 2012. Wyndham as a whole purchased more than a million pillows last year alone. 3. Housekeepers and hot dog vendors have something in common . Rather than tucking a laundered pillowcase under their chin, hospitality expert Jacob Tomsky says that hotel housekeepers have a chop-and-fold method of slipping pillows into pillowcases. ""Kind of like a hot dog bun,"" he says. A 10-year veteran of the hotel business, Tomsky's New York Times bestselling book ""Heads in Beds: A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles, and So-Called Hospitality"" was published last year. The hot dog bun trick could come in handy at home. Surely there's a Youtube video out there. 4. In the hotel biz, BYOP = WTF . Tomsky says that one thing that drives housekeepers bonkers is people who bring their own pillows. ""That housekeeper is going to see hundreds of thousands of hotel pillows,"" he explains. ""Why would you need to bring your own?"" For guests allergic to down-filled pillows, Tomsky says that hotels keep a large supply of foam pillows. While theft isn't that common, (though Tomsky notes that some people will even take the batteries from the remote control) the occasional guest will steal the pillows from the bed and pack them right into their bags. 5. Not all rock stars trash hotel rooms the same way . Tomsky tells the story of the singer of a classic rock band who wanted 15 pillows for his bed. As requested, the pillows were piled on his bed in a huge pyramid. The next morning? ""They were scattered all over the floor,"" says Tomsky. ""There is no way to sleep on that."" Tell us who it is, please? Steven Tyler? Bon Jovi? The Nuge? Maybe Meatloaf or Styx warbler Dennis DeYoung? When pressed for the name, Tomsky, a true hotelier to his discreet core, declines to provide personal information concerning one of his guests. 6. If you want a firm pillow, Singapore is the place . Many hotels are known for their ""pillow menus,"" which give guests the choice of what they rest their head upon. But few pillow menus are as varied as the list at Conrad Centennial Singapore, which has 16 pillows guests can choose from. Alongside down and foam options are buckwheat, tatami and porcelain. Porcelain pillows, as well as ones made from jade, wood and bronze, were popular in China from the 6th to early 20th centuries. 7. You can get your hotel pillow personalized . At the Beverly Hills Peninsula, VIP, suite and villa guests, and guests who have stayed five days at the property, get to sleep on pillowcases monogrammed with their initials. The hotel has more than a 1,000 pillowcases on hand in a variety of initial combinations, though for the Isabel Isaacs and Zachary Xaviers out there, monogramming a new pillow only takes five to 10 minutes. At the end of their stay, guests can take their pillowcases with them or opt to have them boxed for their next stay at the Peninsula. In addition, many chains have websites such as hiltontohome.com and ritzcarltonshops.com that allow people to purchase hotel pillows for their homes. 8. Don't think too hard about your hotel pillow ... or this article . Jacob Tomsky says, like death and deli meat, people don't think much about the life of a hotel pillow. And that's a good thing. ""When you put your head on a pillow it would blow your mind to think about how many other heads have been on that pillow,"" he says. ""If you go to a hotel and come back a year later and stay in the same room, you're going to put your head on the same pillow and there are a lot of people who have done a lot of things on that pillow on the meantime. ""Whatever people do in their rooms, pillows are always there. They're either directly involved or very nearby.""","The Wyndham Hotel Group purchased more than a million pillows last year .

Some hotel guests bring their own pillows. Housekeepers find this annoying .

"(CNN) -- Whitey Bulger sits at the defense table, awaiting his fate, looking like an old man waiting for a bus. Most defendants, certainly those facing such serious charges, try to create a good impression for jurors, donning suit and tie and looking for all and sundry a respectable guy. But each day at his trial in a federal courthouse named for a congressman that was his neighbor in South Boston, 83-year-old Whitey Bulger dons the suit of an Everyman: jeans, white sneakers, a simple shirt. He is an Everyman charged in 19 murders, and with terrorizing Boston, holding the city's psyche hostage, aided and abetted by the FBI, for which he served as an informant for some 15 years. He insists he wasn't an informant despite an overwhelming public record that shows he was one, including more than 700 pages of information he fed to a disgraced and now imprisoned FBI agent, John Connolly, who grew up in the same housing project in a neighborhood known as Southie. In Southie, loyalty was everything. Loyalty to family, to friends, to neighbors, to neighborhood. It was an Irish thing, in an Irish neighborhood. Bulger exploited that obsession with loyalty, expecting loyalty from everyone else, delivering it to no one but himself. As Bulger's trial hurtles toward the end of its seventh week, his attorneys have spent as much time disputing something he is not even charged with -- being an FBI informant -- as they have challenging a sweeping indictment that accuses Bulger of being a vicious and venal overlord of Southie, using murder and intimidation to control a small but lucrative gang that made millions by shaking down bookmakers, drug dealers, and, when Bulger realized the FBI really had his back, legitimate business people. Bulger's lawyers have also spent considerable time disputing charges that he strangled two women, Debra Davis and Deborah Hussey, the girlfriend and stepdaughter of his partner in crime, Steve Flemmi. They are doing what their client wants, and their client knows he is not going to be acquitted of all charges. In letters that my colleague Shelley Murphy and I obtained for our book, ""Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice,"" Bulger revealed an obsession with rehabilitating an image he spent his entire criminal life constructing. That is the image of the good bad guy, the wiseguy with scruples. The wiseguy who picked up Mrs. Moakley, the mother of the future congressman, and brought her home and carried her groceries upstairs. But wiseguys with scruples don't rat on their friends, and they certainly don't murder defenseless women and bury them in secret graves. This is history unfolding in Boston, where Bulger is firmly established not only as the city's most famous criminal but one of its most infamous citizens, and other citizens have been lining up at dawn to catch a glimpse of a man whose grandfatherly demeanor masks a legacy drenched in blood and secret, shallow graves. But it's also a history lesson in that the Boston where Whitey Bulger prospered in is gone. The blue-collar people he grew up with and then exploited have been priced out of the condos and sprawling three-deckers in Southie by yuppies who have nothing in common with Bulger and his ilk. The ethnic dynamic that led the FBI to cut deals with vicious Irish gangsters such as Bulger, all in a myopic dash to get the Mafia, is gone. There is no Irish mob in Boston anymore. The Mafia, meanwhile, is a pathetic shell of itself, a handful of ""Sopranos"" wannabes, reduced to sports betting and the odd drug deal, which always gets them caught. The state created the lottery to take over the mob's real moneymaker, the number. The biggest bookie in the state is the state. At the Joe Moakley Courthouse, named for the guy whose mother Whitey used to drive home, the gallery was taken aback when Jay Carney, Bulger's lead counsel, copped to most of the indictment in his opening statement. He admitted his client was a bookmaker, an extortionist, even a drug trafficker. That last admission was a shocker because Bulger and his apologists, including his politically connected family, had long insisted he would never profit from drugs, that he in fact kept drugs out of Southie. There was a method to what Bulger's few remaining sycophants would consider the madness of admitting to shaking down drug dealers who peddled poison to the neighborhood. Whitey's reasoning is pretty obvious: If he admits to all these terrible crimes, why not believe him when he says he didn't kill the women and he wasn't a rat? The problem for Bulger is that the prosecution has done a good job showing that he was a vainglorious gangster for whom reputation was everything, that his family, including younger brother Bill Bulger, the longest serving president of the Massachusetts Senate, was invested in maintaining the myth of Whitey as benevolent criminal. Whitey Bulger can't bear the thought that he will die and the narrative he spent so many years honing will be written by those who brought him to justice. He drove Mrs. Moakley and all the other old ladies in the projects home and carried their groceries up the stairs, damn it. Can't everybody see that? The Irish consciousness is littered with the betrayal of the informer. In his letters from jail that Murphy and I obtained, Bulger said he felt like Philip Nolan, the noble protagonist in Edward Everett Hale's short story ""The Man Without a Country,"" cast to sea because he challenged his government. But Bulger is actually more like Gypo Nolan, the protagonist from Liam O'Flaherty's great story ""The Informer,"" about a man who gave up his friend and lived to regret it. The prosecution, expected to wrap up within days, has produced a parade of witnesses that include alleged victims of Bulger's violence and a posse of his former criminal confederates, all of whom have cut sweet deals for themselves in exchange for their testimony against Bulger. John Martorano, an admitted murder of 20, served just 12 years, in cushy conditions. In return, he implicated Bulger in 11 murders. He was a repulsive, if effective, witness. Kevin Weeks, Bulger's protege and gravedigger, did just five years for his involvement in a half-dozen murders. When Weeks referred to his mentor as a rat, Bulger's nice old man veil dropped. ""You suck!"" Bulger hissed. ""F**k you,"" Weeks replied. ""F**k you, too,"" Bulger said. This from a guy who bragged that he read Machiavelli and Kant in prison. While the exchange reduced the Southie courtroom to a Southie locker room, Bulger's attorneys were pleased, thinking it made Weeks look like a thug, which he is. But where did he learn all this? At the knee of Whitey Bulger. That has been the defense's burden. Every time they succeed in showing Bulger's former partners in crime as craven, vicious people they simply reinforce the notion that Bulger was in charge of them all. Lately, it's been Flemmi, Bulger's opposite number, who has held center stage. He is 79, hard of hearing, but he has a pretty good memory. He is a degenerate, an admitted murderer of 10, including his girlfriend Debbie Davis and his stepdaughter Debbie Hussey. Of course, he admitted it but took no responsibility, blaming Bulger, saying he went along with the plots to kill them because Bulger pressured him into it. And, Flemmi insisted, it was Bulger who strangled them, while he just watched. Again, as defense attorneys picked at Flemmi's flaws, including his sexual abuse of his own stepdaughter, it only served to highlight the company Bulger kept. These are his buds, his homeys, and he will live with them and most likely he will die with them, except like Flemmi he will be in prison. If he does, he'll make out better than Gypo Nolan, who was shot dead, like so many of Bulger's alleged victims. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Cullen.","Kevin Cullen: Whitey Bulger's worst fear is to be called in an informant .

"(CNN) -- Police in Dresden, Germany, say they have arrested a 55-year-old police officer on suspicion of murdering and butchering a man he met on a cannibalism website. The two men met on Zambian Meat, an Internet chat forum where people discuss their sexual and cannibalistic fantasies. Text messages and online chats revealed that the 59-year-old victim from Hanover asked to be killed, police said. Dresden Police Chief Dieter Kroll said at a news conference: ""The victim had been fantasizing about being killed and eaten since his youth."" Marko Laske, a police spokesman, said: ""Our investigations have just begun, and we cannot confirm rumors yet that the suspect has eaten parts of the victim or that it was a sexually motivated act."" There is no evidence that the suspect ate body parts, and he denied doing so, Laske said. The arrested man works for Saxony's State Office of Criminal Investigation in the forensics department. He was known as an ""inconspicuous and normal colleague,"" police said. Police did not name the suspect. German media are identifying him as ""Detlev G."" After having been in contact for months through chat, e-mail, telephone and text, the men agreed to meet on November 4. They met at Dresden's main train station, police and prosecutors said, and shortly after went to a guesthouse in the Ore Mountains that belongs to the alleged killer. The police officer is believed to then have killed, tortured and dismembered the man, and buried his body parts on the land around his guesthouse. The victim was reported missing in November. The police officer gave a partial confession by admitting that he killed the man from Hanover. He did not reveal his motive. The police officer was arrested two days ago while on duty. ""It is an utterly extraordinary case. For an unusual case with such wide repercussions, it will take a while to find out the truth about what really happened and why he did it,"" Laske said. In 2001, Armin Meiwes was arrested for killing and eating a voluntary victim he met on the Internet. Meiwes posted an advertisement on the Cannibal Cafe website, looking for a young man for ""slaughter and consumption."" His victim, Bernd Brandes, reportedly agreed to be butchered alive before being killed and eaten. Meiwes, who captured the killing on video, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.","A German policeman is accused of murdering and dismembering a man .

"(CNN) -- Nearly two years ago, after Mitt Romney's presidential campaign went down to defeat, I gave some ideas in these pages on CNN about how Republicans can win future elections. On that list was an instruction that Republicans need to stop being the ""stupid party."" While it is true that we as Republicans need to do a better job articulating our principles and being the party of bold new ideas, the Democrats have a far worse problem. Democrats need to stop being the party that thinks Americans themselves are stupid. To take one example: At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing in April, members asked Treasury official Mark Iwry if the Obama administration believed it could delay Obamacare's individual mandate, much as the Treasury delayed the employer mandate. Iwry's response was stunning: ""If we believe it is fair to individuals to keep that (individual mandate) in place because it protects them ... then we don't reach the question (of) whether we have legal authority."" The level of sheer arrogance in that response boggles the mind. A Treasury spokesman later publicly disclosed the Obama administration's official position: The federal government, namely the IRS, is requiring all individuals to purchase insurance to ""protect"" the American people from themselves. Lest anyone think this attitude comes from anywhere other than the very top of the Obama administration, take the President's own comments last October. In a speech in Boston at the peak of the controversy surrounding insurance cancellations, the President repeatedly derided canceled plans as ""substandard ... cut-rate plans that don't offer real financial protection."" And he didn't just insult the plans themselves, he insulted the people who purchased them: ""A lot of people thought they were buying coverage, and it turned out to be not so good."" In other words, if you like your current plan, you're delusional—or a dimwit. The President soon backtracked, and unilaterally waived portions of the bill he signed into law, allowing some individuals to keep their plans, temporarily. But while the President expressed regret for having engaged in what Politifact dubbed the ""Lie of the Year,"" he has not once apologized for the arrogant and patronizing attitude underpinning the entire controversy—one in which the President believes that he and his bureaucrats know better than everyday Americans. Sadly, this attitude does not just pervade Washington liberals; it's also right at home in my state of Louisiana. In 2012, the executive director of a state teachers' union claimed that school scholarship programs wouldn't work, because low-income parents could not make decisions about their children's education, saying they ""have no clue."" These comments perfectly illustrate the left's double standards. Both President Barack Obama and Eric Holder—the attorney general who filed suit to impede our scholarship program but lied to Congress about it last month—choose to educate their children at elite Washington schools costing more than $35,000 per year. But if Americans of more modest financial means—whose annual income may be dwarfed by the tuition fees President Obama easily pays for his daughters—want their children to escape failing schools, or buy the health plan they want, the left exclaims: ""Oh no, we can't let you do that."" That's exactly how The Nation magazine reacted to the health care alternative I recently endorsed. Responding to the plan's new incentives giving individuals more choices and insurance options, its analysts claimed that ""most people are not informed well enough (sic) to make the right choices about which plan to buy, what it covers, what it will cost them, and especially how to decide what care to seek."" That's what The Nation considers an ""epic fail:"" allowing the ""ignorant"" American people to pick their own health care options. I will readily admit that we do need to improve the transparency of health care cost and quality information. And of course in an emergency no patient in cardiac arrest will be able to ""comparison shop"" for treatment options. But if The Nation, President Obama, or anyone else on the left thinks the American people are too dumb to pick a school or health plan, they should say so publicly—and in so many words. Ronald Reagan famously quipped that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are ""I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."" I believe the best way to help is to empower citizens, trusting them to make good choices, not creating nanny states to ""protect"" individuals from themselves. As a matter of policy, giving Americans choice in schools and health care is simply the right thing to do. And as a matter of politics, insulting voters' intelligence is just plain stupid.

"(CNN) -- Early this year, a crime spree hit the usually quiet residential neighborhood of Grandview, northeast of downtown Phoenix, Arizona. Over a period of three months, there were 25 home burglaries in the neighborhood, often carried out while residents were out for just a few hours. When police work failed to produce any arrests, the community took to the Internet to do some sleuthing on its own. They crowdsourced details of the crimes on Nextdoor.com, a private social network for urban neighborhoods, and began noticing patterns. The burglars would wait to see a homeowner leave and then enter the house and stuff a pillowcase with high-value items like jewelry, guns and cameras before slinking out. Sometimes, they'd hit as many as three houses in a day. The residents started a virtual neighborhood watch using Nextdoor, sending out detailed alerts about any suspicious cars or people and essentially live-blogging strangers' movements throughout the 1 square-mile area. Led by Grandview neighborhood association President Slade Grove, the community eventually gathered enough information and attention to push the local police department into action, resulting in an undercover sweep of the area and multiple drug busts. Though no arrests have yet been specifically tied to the break-ins, the rate of burglaries fitting that pattern in Grandview has plummeted. ""Before, they didn't have these tools. It was people chit-chatting in their front yards,"" Grove said. ""I think it has shown the police department that we are an active neighborhood and that we are very concerned about crime. ""I think it has also shown them that we will stand up for our neighborhood, and by God, you better pay attention to us."" A sheriff in your pocket . Neighborhood watch groups have been around for decades. They are meant to empower residents to report suspicious activities to police without acting on them directly. Now, thanks to mobile devices and social media, today's homeowners are using a new arsenal of digital tools to fight crime, coordinate in an emergency and revitalize the neighborhood watch. The National Sheriff's Association is working on an app that will help neighborhood watch members share real-time video surveillance footage shot on a smartphone with law enforcement and with each other. The hope is that the program will shorten response times between when civilians believe they've witnessed something suspicious and when police respond. ""After the Trayvon Martin case in Florida, we started looking at our program,"" said Chief John Thompson, deputy executive director of the National Sheriffs' Association. Martin, 17, was shot and killed in February 2012 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator in his gated community of Twin Lakes, near Orlando. Zimmerman was not on duty at the time, and his actions were quickly disavowed by neighborhood watch associations, which frown upon vigilante violence. ""We don't want people to get involved, and this app would pretty much stop that. You wouldn't have to get out of your car. You wouldn't have to leave your house,"" Thompson said. If a neighborhood watch member spots a crime in progress or suspicious activity, they can take out their smartphone, open the free iOS/Android app and hit the emergency button to record photos, video, audio and the precise GPS location of their phone. The information is automatically uploaded every few seconds to a secure cloud server, where it cannot be deleted. The mapped alert with the video can be sent directly to the local police, other neighbors in the group and even a custom list of personal emergency contacts. It can also dial 911. The new initiative, called Neighborhood Watch NOW, is a collaboration between the Sheriffs' Association and a company called ICE BlackBox, which developed the app. The tool has been in development for 2Â½ years and is rolling out this month in a handful of pilot neighborhoods, starting with two counties in Arizona and Minnesota. Local members and law enforcement agencies will need to be trained on the technology. ""It's going to be the future of neighborhood watch,"" said Thompson. Going Nextdoor . Although the Neighborhood Watch NOW app is designed to be used during emergencies, much of what happens daily in a neighborhood is far from 911-worthy: a stolen bike, broken car windows, loud parties and so on. For the past year, the San Diego Police Department has used the Nextdoor app to field local concerns and improve communication with residents. Members also use Nextdoor to coordinate social events, announce garage sales, find contractors and track down missing pets. They say it makes them feel more connected to their neighbors. Residents of Westgate Village, a suburb of San Jose, California, use Nextdoor to coordinate block parties and revive the quaint ideal of a neighborhood where people know each other's names and look out for one another. During a recent rash of garage robberies, members used Nextdoor to remind people to lock their garage doors. To start a Nextdoor community, one person fills out an application and must sign up at least 10 neighbors in 21 days to make it official. More than 33,000 neighborhoods across the country now use the network. In San Diego, each Nextdoor network is assigned a community relations officer who can use the platform to field questions, post crime updates and safety tips, and chat with members. ""It gives everyone a chance to actually get to know the officers that are working for them,"" said Matthew Tortorella, a San Diego police officer who oversees much of the department's social media. He said the officers like Nextdoor as a way to address minor complaints, such as telling residents whom to call to remove graffiti. Tortorella also would like to see the app become even more hyperfocused, say on an apartment building with as few as 15 units. A single building could have its own network, and property managers could be trained on how to use the app to reduce crime. Police also receive tips through the Nextdoor app. Recently, a resident in San Diego's northwest division spotted a Ford pickup that had been parked facing the wrong way for a number of days. They reported the car on Nextdoor, and when an officer went to check it out, they discovered that the vehicle was stolen and had been used in several burglaries in the area. ""We don't want (Nextdoor) to become a way of reporting crimes,"" said Tortorella. ""We still want people to call the police."" Finally, Nextdoor could become another way for police and fire departments to quickly broadcast warnings, Amber Alerts and evacuation instructions. It's been used during California wildfires and the polar vortex that froze much of the U.S. over the winter. ""I believe that the best information comes from the authorities, but a lot of times, the authorities don't have a way to reach people,"" said Nextdoor CEO Nirav Tolia.","Neighborhood watch associations add smartphones, social networking to arsenals .

"(CNN) -- Before humans ever went into space, there were books about the possibility. Some were fantasies about life in the cosmos. Some were scientific histories. Eventually, after the Space Age began, some profiled the men and women who brought space exploration to life. With the shuttle Atlantis concluding America's 30-year space shuttle program, it seems only fitting that we sample a few books about space exploration. The United States began its program with the seven Mercury astronauts, so here are seven books -- six works of nonfiction and one of fiction -- about aiming for the stars. Top 5 space movies . ""The Right Stuff"" by Tom Wolfe . Wolfe's history of the early space program, which originated as a four-part series in Rolling Stone, was a 1979 best-seller. The book blends the stories of test pilots such as Chuck Yeager -- fearless, free-spirited fliers who blazed the trail for the future Mercury astronauts (all of whom were pilots themselves). ""It is Tom Wolfe at his very best, better in fact than he's been before. It is technically accurate, learned, cheeky, risky, touching, tough, compassionate, nostalgic, worshipful, jingoistic -- it is superb,"" wrote C.D.B. Bryan in The New York Times. Indeed, it may be Wolfe's best book. ""Apollo: The Race to the Moon"" by Charles Murray and Catherine Bly Cox . There are a number of fine books on the Apollo program, including ""Moon Shot,"" by astronauts Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton, and Andrew Chaikin's ""A Man on the Moon."" But Murray and Cox's thorough 1989 history of the program that led to the moon landing remains a standout, with finely etched portraits of NASA's behind-the-scenes personnel and the drama of overcoming scientific and political obstacles. Space station crew takes final spacewalk of shuttle era . ""Packing for Mars"" by Mary Roach . So you think being an astronaut is easy? As Roach demonstrates in her amusing and informative book, which came out last year, it's anything but. Humans weren't designed for space, with its lack of gravity and endless opportunities for boredom, and Roach (""Stiff,"" ""Bonk"") revels in tales of bodily fluids gone awry, the use of cadavers, and what it's like being trapped on a long mission, in a small capsule, with people you may not really like. Something to think about before booking that trip on Virgin Galactic. Minute by minute: Atlantis shuttle lifts off for final time . ""Magnificent Desolation"" by Buzz Aldrin . The second man to land on the moon is more than just an astronaut. Aldrin has a doctorate in aeronautics and put his name on an iPad app. But he's also had his share of struggles. In this memoir, he talks about his life as an astronaut -- but also life afterwards, when he coped with alcoholism and depression. He also has some pointed words about the space program's future. ""Riding Rockets"" by Mike Mullane . The space shuttle has been praised as ""a fantastic vehicle"" by a NASA employee, but the people who have been at the controls didn't always think so. Mullane, a former pilot who flew three shuttle missions, is brash, profane and blunt in talking about NASA's culture -- and often tender when telling stories about his fellow astronauts. He's also hilarious. Atlantis mission extended . ""Moon Dust"" by Andrew Smith . For all the people who have gone into space -- about 500 -- just 12 have stepped on the moon and returned to tell the tale. Smith, a British journalist, went in search of the surviving moonwalkers and found a set of men who were, by turns, driven, spiritual, reserved and thoughtful. He even got in a few questions with the notoriously private Neil Armstrong. ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" series by Douglas Adams . OK, so the Earth hasn't been destroyed to make way for an hyperspace bypass, and Norway wasn't created by an interstellar architect. Nevertheless, Adams' points remain timeless: The human race is just a giant science experiment, always bring a towel, and -- above all -- don't panic. Good advice whether you're exploring the galaxy -- or Bournemouth.

"(CNN) -- Heat. There's been plenty of it to go around in Arizona these first days of summer -- literally and politically -- after the air conditioning went out at a dog kennel. Sheriff's deputies found 20 dead dogs piled up in a shed on Friday at Green Acres Dog Boarding Facility in Gilbert. The public shock over their deaths led a U.S. senator to issue a public statement on Monday. As fate would have it, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake's son, Austin, was minding the kennel, when the dogs died. Green Acres is owned and operated by two of Flake's relatives, Jesse and Maleisa Hughes, the Maricopa County Sheriff's office said. The couple was out of town, leaving Austin Flake to dogsit, when a dog apparently chewed through the electric wiring connected to the air conditioning, said Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He called it an accident, but at the same time cast doubt on the kennel owners' account of how the dogs died. Kennel owners: It was an accident . ""It was a tragic accident,"" Hughes told CNN. ""We are heartbroken, and we're devastated."" She doesn't believe anyone could have predicted or stopped what happened. The air conditioning unit kicked out in the middle of the night, Hughes said. Austin Flake and his wife slept at the east end of the house, while the temperature climbed to seething heights in the kennel on the west end, Maleisa Hughes said. The dogs sleep there at night in a large, cooled room, she said. The two sides of the house have separate air conditioning units, so the Flakes couldn't feel the suffocating heat. During the day in Gilbert, the mercury has blasted up to over 100 degrees F, easily making it hard to find relief, perhaps even after temperatures dip back down to under 80 at night. By the time the Flakes discovered the dogs at 5:30 a.m., the temperature was over 100 degrees, Hughes said. The gnawed wire was still sputtering off sparks. ""It could have burned down our whole house,"" Hughes said. ""My whole house could have burned down and all my children could have died, and then it would have been a tragedy."" One of the dogs that perished was her own. The Flakes turned a hose and ice on the overheated dogs to try to save them, the sheriff's office said. ""But failed to call for emergency assistance before the dogs died."" Sheriff: Story ""seems unreasonable"" Sheriff Arpaio said that his office is investigating and that parts of Hughes' story seems suspicious. ""It seems unreasonable that dogs could be healthy at 11 p.m. at night and dead by 5:30 a.m. the next morning as the owners suggest,"" he said. A veterinarian he conferred with has corroborated his doubts, Arpaio said. Deputies arrived to find some of the dogs' owners at Green Acres. A couple cried and hugged, as deputies used a wheel barrow to cart off dogs' carcasses wrapped in cloth. Pet owners told Arpaio that the Hughes misled them about the number of dogs kept at the kennel. The Hughes have not been arrested or charged, CNN affiliate KPNX reported. Prodigal embarrassments . News of the pet deaths on his son's watch were followed by a statement from Sen. Flake. ""I can't imagine the devastating loss these families are experiencing. My heart goes out to the owners who lost their beloved pets,"" he said. This is the second summer in a row that a member of Flake's family was involved in a controversy. In June of last year, another son, Tanner Flake, reportedly published racial epithets, homophobic slurs and anti-Semitic remarks on Twitter and used them as user names in online games. Texas inmates sue over lack of air conditioning . CNN's Shane Deitert contributed to this report .","Sheriff's deputies found the dead dogs piled up in a shed at a kennel .

"(CNN) -- The deliberate policies of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his late father, Kim Jong Il, may have killed millions of North Koreans, either by starving them to death or sending them to die in a system of political prisoner concentration camps unlike any since the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. For years, the world has been so fixated on the North's nuclear weapons that it has lost sight of reports of such systematic crimes. Yet they are the very reason we should care that North Korea could develop an effective nuclear arsenal. Indeed one of the very sites of this alleged brutality â€” Camp 16 -- lies right next to North Korea's nuclear test site. A recent report by Amnesty International confronts us with more evidence of the Kim Jong Un regime's disregard for the lives of its own people and, by extension, our own. We've long known that these camps were places of horror. Kang Chol Hwan, one of few survivors, published his memoir of Camp 15 more than a dozen years ago. One of us published the first satellite imagery of Camp 16 in 2007, finding what appeared to be its distinctive fence lines and guard posts right where defectors said they would be. But even in 2012, when this detailed imagery analysis of Camp 16 was published, there were still no eyewitness accounts. It was a place prisoners never left, dead or alive. Still, we have accounts of what went on in the other camps. Witnesses had told about the building in Camp 22 where two parents breathed air into the lungs of their dying children before they perished together in the camp's experimental gas chamber, and about the two children who drowned when a guard kicked them into a waste pond. We have heard of the guest house at Camp 18 where, according to witness accounts, women prisoners were raped before the guards murdered them, and of the former athlete who was killed by a guard at Camp 14 after hunger drove him to eat part of the guard's leather whip. We read how guards at Camp 15 would allegedly make starving prisoners race along the side of a cliff for corn cakes, and laugh each time one fell to his death. Amnesty International has since found the first known witness from Camp 16, who says that guards there forced prisoners to dig their own graves and then killed them with hammers. He reports that at Camp 16, too, guards raped and murdered women, whose names we'll never know. We add their fate to a long list of horrors, but at least, in some small way, they are mourned. Until a year ago, we would have estimated that the total population of these camps was 200,000. Today, our estimate is closer to half of that. The ""lucky"" survivors of Camp 18 were apparently ""released in place"" when the fences around their camp were taken down, but the 30,000 prisoners of Camp 22 simply disappeared. Local residents said that a few thousand survivors were loaded onto trains in the night and sent away, perhaps to Camp 16. The Amnesty report concluded that new construction at Camp 16 could not hold this many new prisoners. The fate of Camp 22's survivors -- if there were any -- remains unknown. New imagery shows that North Korea recently expanded three camps -- Camps 14, 16 and 25. The prisoners in these camps, according to witness accounts, are condemned by nothing resembling a fair trial, for things we would not recognize as crimes â€” complaining about hardships in the ""People's Paradise,"" escaping to find food, practicing religion, criticizing the ruling Kim family, or simply being related to such ""offenders."" (North Korea collectively punishes the children, spouses and parents of political prisoners.) The world is belatedly awakening to evidence of North Korea's crimes against humanity. The U.N.'s creation of a commission of inquiry to investigate such crimes is an important start, but it is only that. As innocent North Koreans languish, starve and die in these camps, largely hidden from view, the world must open its eyes to this deplorable reality. The capacity for abstract sympathy is not just the mark of human civilization, it warns us of a growing danger to all of humanity. Just as the world once united to condemn and isolate South Africa's apartheid regime, it must deny the Kim regime access to the global financial system until it closes these murderous camps forever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joshua Stanton and Sung-Yoon Lee.","Joshua Stanton, Sung-Yoon Lee: Recent Amnesty report shows North Korea prison horrors .

"(CNN) -- What's with this wacky weather? It's so cold in Florida that farmers joke the oranges are squeezing themselves to stay warm. But Alaska is so warm that a ski resort's been forced to close. Add to this curious mix, giant waves in Hawaii, a historic drought in California, and bears coming out of hibernation in Nevada, and you can't help but wonder: What is going on with the weather? To be sure, the United States is a giant place -- 3,000 miles wide from coast to coast. But even taking that into account, what you have here has to be at least a tad bit out of the norm. Right? ""It's not actually that unusual,"" says Roger Edwards, a meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center at the National Weather Service. Usually a few times each winter, the temperatures flip-flop where Tallahassee is colder than Anchorage. ""But,"" he says, ""this one is more persistent than we normally see."" Northeast: Super bowled . This whole weather system business is a balancing act. ""When there's extremely cold air in one area, some other part is going to be warm,"" says Edwards. Tell that to the folks in the Northeast who are still digging out from more than a foot of snow in some places and shivering with temperatures in the single digits -- a full 15 to 25 degrees below normal. On Tuesday, 10 inches of snow fell on MetLife Stadium, which hosts the Super Bowl in 10 days. It gave National Football League officials a chance to test their snow removal plan, affiliate NY1 reported. NFL officials say it will take 1,600 workers about 18 hours to clear the stadium and parking lots. ""The stadium operations staff along with NFL productions staff is running this as a dress rehearsal and we have people watching, and evaluating and grading,"" said NFL Executive Vice President Eric Grubman. Dropping the (snow)ball on game day would be bad PR for the league. About 111 million Americans watched last year's game. The extended forecast isn't providing much to be optimistic about though. ""The way the pattern is set up right now, there will be a series of cold air shots,"" Edwards said. ""The basic pattern is going to stay this way for another week or so."" Alaska: Hit the ski(d)s . Contrast that with Anchorage, Alaska, where Thursday's forecast high will be around 45 degrees. A typical high would be in the low 20s. The seven-day forecast holds more of the same. Temperatures like that are bad news for the Alyeska Ski Resort which closed for the third time this winter. Rain fell Wednesday on an empty parking lot. ""Sometimes you get epic storms. If this was 10 degrees cooler, it would be one of those,"" Eric Helmbrecht, the owner of Powder Hound Ski Shop, told CNN affiliate KTUU, trying to sound hopeful ""We will get snow and it will be fine."" Hawaii: Making waves . Waves up to 50 feet high have been pounding the North Shore of Oahu -- the largest Hawaii's seen since 2004. ""It's a spectacle. It's incredible,"" resident Daniela Power said. ""It's so big and massive and powerful and it's really a special thing to watch for sure."" What's causing it? A large storm with hurricane-force winds that's sending a giant swell toward the island. The surf peaked overnight, the weather service said. Great news for surfers, right? Not quite. At first glance, the tall waves would appear to offer a golden opportunity for participants in a big wave surf contest that was scheduled to take place Wednesday on Oahu. But the organizers have postponed the event. They say that although the waves are expected to be pleasingly large, the wind conditions are no good. California: No rain on the ranches . Winter is California's wet season. It's the dead of winter now, but there no cloud in sight and nary a raindrop in the forecast. California's facing perhaps its worst drought since record-keeping began a century ago, California Gov. Jerry Brown proclaimed this month. It's pushed farmers and ranchers to their financial limits. There's nothing on the ground for animals to eat. ""I borrowed money -- I hate to even say that -- but I recently borrowed money to buy hay,"" says rancher Harold Kelly. ""Normally, it'd be raining and we'd have grass growing,"" he says. ""The grass is basically all gone."" Nevada: Barely sleeping . An unusual number of black bears are up and about in western Nevada. The winter there has been so abnormally warm and dry winter that the bears are done with their hibernation and headed out for food. The National Weather Service's forecast for Incline Village, Nevada, for instance, calls for high temperatures heading to or well past 50 degrees for the next week at least, with nary of snow flurry in sight. It's not just Nevada: Nearby Northern California is also seeing an abnormal number of black bears, with CNN affiliate KXTV showing images taken from Yosemite National Park and Lake Tahoe's Heavenly Ski Resort. Healy said ""a disastrous winter"" -- adding ""we need the snow"" -- and relatively mild temperatures have thrown off some black bears. ""We documented this and, in the past 15 years, it occurs sporadically,"" the spokesman said. ""A lot of it is dictated by the weather conditions."" And, as we know, this year it's been all kinds of weird. CNN's Steve Almasy, Greg Botelho, Carma Hassan, Sonya Hamasaki, Michael Martinez and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","An Alaskan ski resort gets rain instead of snow .

"(CNN) -- When administrators at White Pass Jr. Sr. High School in Randle, Washington, asked students to dress up as their favorite celebrities for Spirit Week, Mason Mudge and Chandler Krueger did just that. Mudge came as Miss America. And Krueger dressed up as Nicki Minaj. But Principal Gary Stamper reportedly wasn't feeling their school spirit. According to CNN affiliate KING5 News, Stamper told the boys to change -- or go home. ""If they really wanted Spirit Week, then why punish somebody for being spirited and all that?"" Krueger asks. The 10th-graders refused to switch clothing and left school. The next day, many of their classmates skipped American Pride Day and instead came to school dressed as the opposite sex in protest of what had happened. Superintendent Chuck Wyborney told KING5 News that things should have been handled differently with Krueger and Mudge. None of the students on the second day were asked to change. ""I think it's really awesome that all the kids support me and support the decisions that I made,"" Mudge said. More schools around the country are adopting acceptance policies in support of transgender children and children who don't conform to gender norms. Wyborney told KING5 News that this was a learning opportunity for both students and staff.","Two male students dressed as Miss America and Nicki Minaj for Spirit Week .

"(CNN) -- We have long moved on from the idea of African design being simply Africa centered. In the past couple of years it has made it onto catwalks in Paris, New York, Milan and beyond. And of course, as with any competitive market, there will always be new talent changing the game. In African fashion today, names like Lanre Da-Silva Ajayi, Thula Sindi, Deola Segoe, Ozwald Boateng and more are praised in the hallways of fashion houses. And now there is a new breed of designers who have caught the attention of fashion enthusiasts in Africa and abroad. So here are seven emerging African designers to watch out for this year. Shakara Couture . Ewemade Erhabor-Emokpae has had a long obsession with the vintage glamor of the 1920s and 50s. Her design label -- Shakara Couture -- has encompassed the aesthetics, ambiance and essence of the present couture era and added an African flair. Officially launched in 2012, the design label had its first major debut at the Music Meets Runway 2012 event where African designers clamoured together to unveil their late 2012 collections. Her collection was filled with long luxurious dresses with lace detail, creative fascinators, wide brim hats and satin gloves. Recently, she released a few photos from her 2013 collection titled ""There is No Such Thing As Too Much Glamor."" The campaign photos showcased a young housewife carrying about her daily chores dressed to the nines. Read this: Africa Fashion Week hits London catwalks . Kaela Kay . When I first encountered the Kaela Kay design label I was immediately struck with its big and loud prints and funky designs. Created by Ghanaian designer Catherine Addai the label thrives on its passion to transform bold and extravagant prints into feminine, sexy and modern clothes for the modern woman. Addai has created the Kaela Kay woman to stand out. The Kaela Kay woman is a refined socialite who walks with her shoulders back and her head held high. Apart from her label's aesthetics, which always have a professional outlook, another reason why the Kaela Kay brand caught my attention was because of its take on prints. It moves to re-interpret print combinations while still keeping its African foundations. Kitschai . When the 2013 collection ""Unicorns and Bullet Wounds"" from Kitschai was released, fashion enthusiasts were engulfed by a wave of curiosity. The design label introduced an edgy and risquÃ© collection that wasn't typical of Nigerian designers and has not been seen elsewhere in this year's batch of collections. Created by London-based Nigerian Andrea Ushedo, she incorporated her punk/retro personality into the designs, making them just dark and edgy enough. With such an impressive debut, one can only wait in anticipation for what the label will bring out next. Love April . Whenever I think of the Ghanaian Love April design label, I think of sultry and feminine designs with a hint of African detail. Nina Barkers-Woode launched the Love April brand in 2011. She started it as a label offering ready-to-wear clothes for women, as well as leather goods and accessories. Read this: Glorious fashion in the desert . According to her interview with Shadders Africa: ""It embodies today's woman with the marriage between sophistication and sexiness which allows her to step into the world, wherever that might be, feeling and looking confident."" She last showcased her 2012/2013 collection at Ghana Fashion Week 2012, where it received a lot of praise. Milq & Honey . Dark earthy tones, gold panel details and a twist to every piece are the three qualities that come to mind every time I look at a collection piece from Milq & Honey. Owned by Gabriella and Kelly Davids, the South African label speaks to the confident woman who is sexy and edgy, yet glamorous and classy. Their clothes are inspired by energetic colors, animals and the natural patterns and shapes of the Earth. At the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Cape Town 2013 they debuted their 2013 collection, which was a mix of light and dark. They started off with a dark ensemble of typical Milq & Honey garments and then went off into a birth of colors in neon and summer-appropriate casual wear. Ernest Mahomane . With the experience gathered from being trained by Gavin Rajarh, Ernest Mahomane's eponymous label could easily pass off as one that has been in the business for years. The label opened the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Cape Town 2013 with an amazing combination of white and red dresses with gathered tulle, fitted bustiers and enhanced shoulder cuts that were as daring and serene as its Spring/Summer 2013/14 collection. The clothes have a smooth and classy appearance that isn't overdone and is true to the Ernest Mahomane ethos of transcendent beauty. Read this: Taking African colors to America's Deep South . Fenix Couture . This Nigerian-Canadian design label reminds me a lot of the Jewel By Lisa label. Its well-tailored designs and understanding for the female form are both professional and appealing. The brand was created by Josephyn Akioyamen, who started her journey into fashion while living in Lagos, Nigeria. She was constantly surrounded by intricate colors and prints and, of course, African culture. Fenix Couture is a combination of timeless elegance and modern luxury brought to life by stimulating textiles and precision tailoring. With its 2013 Ihotu Collection, the label introduced itself to the world as one not just to watch, but a label that is so transformational that it would last for years to come. Creating a fashion label begins with the birth of passion, after which the dream is filled with enthusiasm and drive. I have only listed seven African designers that are certain to do great things this year and in the years to come, but there are many others that, just like these, are taking the African fashion industry to new heights. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Obiuwevbi.","BellaNaija.com writer Jennifer Obiuwevbi charts the change in African fashion design .

"(CNN) -- As migrant children continue to cross the border into the United States, dominating the immigration debate this summer, Texas Gov. Rick Perry says that's a sideshow and maintains that the real issue at the border is the wave of criminals who have crossed over it. Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, said Sunday morning on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that politicians in Washington ""have to deal with the immediate crisis right now,"" referring to the migrant children border crossings. But Perry said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the influx of unaccompanied minors crossing the border, mostly into Texas, is a ""side issue."" Numerous politicians have said the 62,000 unaccompanied minors who have crossed into Texas is a humanitarian crisis. The situation is overloading holding facilities and taxing the immigration system -- all of which is costing an additional hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars. Perry, meanwhile, said he is ""substantially more concerned about"" criminals crossing a porous border. ""That's the real issue here, and one that all too often gets deflected by the conversation about unaccompanied minor children,"" he said Sunday. Criminal border-crossers is a theme Perry has been hitting since he announced in late July that he would send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the border to help ""combat"" crime. He restated that position Sunday in an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley. ""We'll continue to do what we have to do to keep our citizens safe,"" he said. Once again, he said that criminals in the United States illegally are responsible for 3,000 homicides and nearly 8,000 sexual assaults since 2008. But PolitiFact Texas fact-checked the statistics and concluded that the statement ""is both incorrect and ridiculous."" Perry told Crowley he stands by those statistics. Perry sending National Guard troops to border . Perry's crime statistics have been debunked, the rate of undocumented immigrants crossing the border is at its lowest since the early 1980s and most other politicians are focused on the fact that more than twice as many migrant children crossed the border this year than last. So why is Perry focusing on criminals? Republican strategist Ana Navarro, whose job it is to analyze and craft Republican political strategy, said she has ""no idea"" why Perry is focused on crime. ""I had a hard time following his train of thought,"" she added. But Republican strategist Leslie Sanchez said Perry focuses on the criminal component of the border issue because it is one component of the larger problem at the border. ""The (Obama) administration's weak stand over the past six years produced an environment where exactly this type of crisis unfurls,"" she said. Perry, whose term is up this year, is considering another run at the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. His previous White House campaign was crippled partly because of the Republican voter base's displeasure with a law he signed more than a decade ago giving children of undocumented immigrants in-state college tuition. In addition to violent criminals, Perry indicated Sunday that terrorists are using a porous southern border to enter the United States. His statement was backed up by Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who said on ""State of the Union,"" that ""we believe (people who) are connected in some way with terrorist organizations at least having the understanding ... it is a weakness in our national security."" It's the same argument that was made after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and spurred the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and doubling the amount spent on border security and border patrol agents. Perry's focus, however, has evolved over the course of the debate over migrant youths. Just one month ago, during a congressional hearing held near the border, Perry sounded a different tune. He lectured members of Congress that they need to work with President Barack Obama to address the influx of unaccompanied minors. ""The President has bypassed Congress -- and maybe he could and should, I don't know, I'm not going to wade in -- but this is the one time that I really think the President does need all of you, Democrats and Republicans alike, to be working with you and reaching out,"" he said on July 3. But since then, Perry has chosen to focus solely on the need for greater border security and protection to tamp down on crime and illegal border crossings, even though the total number of undocumented immigrants has mostly declined. While the number of youths has more than doubled in just one year, the total number of immigrants had continued to drop over the past eight years to about 400,000, compared with about 1 million each year from 1983 until 2006. By focusing only on border security, Perry safely toes the Republican position and is in line with many Americans. On the issue of immigration since the migrant youth crisis, polling shows Americans' priorities have shifted. According to a July CNN/ORC poll, 51% now say the government's focus on immigration policy should be formulating a plan to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants rather than dealing with the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants who are here. But the issue of children is more complicated. The same poll found contradictions in people's opinions. While 54% of respondents supported spending ""several billion dollars"" to care for the children while they waited an immigration judge, 62% of the same people surveyed also supported a bill that would make it easier to deport them.","Many call the border situation a humanitarian crisis; Texas Gov. Rick Perry calls it a ""side issue""

"Washington (CNN) -- Stephen Colbert's ribbing of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's scientific views seemed to strike a nerve, leading the potential GOP presidential contender to jab back Wednesday over Twitter that the comedian is ""no Jon Stewart."" In a series of four tweets -- three of which included links to Colbert's segment -- Jindal said he missed the bit because he was ""too busy pulling out pages on evolution in my kids' biology textbooks."" But, he said, ""if evolution was true,"" Colbert's humor wouldn't be ""so far behind"" Jon Stewart's. Colbert on Tuesday night mocked Jindal -- who studied biology at Brown University, became a Rhodes Scholar and ran the University of Louisiana system -- for evading questions about his own views on evolution. He pointed to Jindal's comments at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast two weeks ago, where he said: ""I will tell you, as a father, I want my kids to be taught about evolution in their schools, but secondly, I think local school districts should make the decision."" Colbert said Jindal's academic pedigree could haunt him in a Republican presidential primary, but that his comments on evolution show he's ""off to an impressive retreat from knowledge."" The comedian was mocking Jindal's appearance at last weekend's 2014 Values Voter Summit, where the Louisiana governor earned 3 percent support among 2016 GOP presidential contenders in a straw poll -- behind the option ""none/no one,"" which drew 4 percent support. ""I applaud Bobby Jindal for so deftly floating this presidential trial balloon,"" Colbert said. ""But please don't call it that, sir, because the science isn't in on ballooning yet. I mean, if hot air rises, how come hell is below us?""","Colbert mocked Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal for answers on his beliefs on evolution.

"London (CNN) -- Syrian opposition leaders and the ""Friends of Syria"" group agree that planned peace talks in Geneva will aim to bring about a democratic transition for Syria in which President Bashar al-Assad plays no part, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said Tuesday. ""We are clear that Syrian President Assad has no role in a peaceful and democratic Syria,"" he said. Hague's words followed a Friends of Syria meeting that brought together foreign ministers from 11 core countries including the United States, Britain, France, Turkey and Gulf nations and Syrian opposition leaders. It was aimed at bolstering the prospects for the peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland. They are expected to take place late next month, although no firm date has been set. Hague said the London meeting had been ""important and productive,"" held against a backdrop of ""the Syrian regime's escalating use of indiscriminate and disproportionate force against the people of Syria."" Victims: Fire fell 'like rain' in Syria . The proposed Geneva conference between Syrian government officials and opposition leaders, intended to broker an end to the country's civil war, has been delayed several times. Syrian war's brutality isn't going away . A key issue has been whether Syrian opposition leaders will agree to take part in the Geneva talks if their stated objective is not to remove al-Assad from power. It's still not clear whether they will attend. Ahmad al-Jarba, president of the Syrian National Coalition, a key opposition group, said Tuesday's talks had been ""positive"" and ""encouraging,"" and it was the first time that all 11 core Friends of Syria governments had agreed on key points. The Syrian opposition groups will hold a general assembly in the coming days, where they will discuss their approach to the Geneva conference, he said. Hague said the Friends of Syria had pledged to support moderate Syrian opposition groups at the talks. ""Geneva offers the Syrian people the best hope to improve their lives,"" he said. 'Road map' to peaceful resolution . The Syrian opposition has set no preconditions for the talks other than that the aims agreed on at a first peace conference in Switzerland last year, known as Geneva I, should stand, Kerry told reporters. ""The opposition is not saying that Assad has to go before this negotiation. That is not what they're saying,"" he said. ""You can't have mutual consent if you're not talking to anybody. You have to go, engage in the discussion and see. ... The opposition has said that their condition is that the intent of this is that Assad goes, which is what happens if you implement Geneva I."" The position of the United States has not changed on the need for al-Assad to go, Kerry added. ""We believe that he has lost all legitimacy, all capacity to govern the country, and therefore it's hard to imagine any resolution in any other way,"" he said. Kerry, who met with opposition leaders before the wider meeting Tuesday, said the agreement that came out of the Geneva I conference should not be discounted. ""The Geneva communique is more than a piece of paper, and it should not be a forgotten level of diplomacy. It is a road map that leads to a new future ... and it rids the country of violent extremist groups,"" he said. The nations involved in Tuesday's talks, known as the ""London 11,"" are committed to seeing the political process through and reaching a negotiated settlement, Kerry said. Asked about reports that Saudi Arabia is frustrated over the U.S. approach to Syria, Kerry said he had had ""frank"" and ""constructive"" talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal over the past two days. ""I'm convinced that we're on the same page,"" he said. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reflects on front-line reports . Chemical weapons . International weapons inspectors have in the past month entered Syria to begin verifying and destroying its chemical weapons arsenal. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Tuesday that Syria's government had so far ""fully cooperated in supporting the work of the advance team"" of chemical weapons inspectors. But some in the Syrian opposition have protested that this has done nothing to stop the killing of Syrian civilians using conventional weapons. Kerry acknowledged progress toward removing al-Assad's chemical weapons, but he said that ""does not remove the crisis and it does not remove the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding before the world's eyes."" According to the United Nations, well over 100,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters. The United States and Russia announced in May that they would try to bring the warring parties to a second conference in Geneva to implement the peace plan they endorsed at Geneva I in 2012 that left open the question of whether al-Assad must leave power. Read more: Polio cases suspected in Syria . Kerry said it would be up to the United Nations and joint U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to announce the date for the conference. Difficulties to overcome . Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby said Sunday in Cairo that peace talks were scheduled for November 23 in Geneva, but the date is not firm. ""There are many arrangements to be made and many difficulties which must be overcome to make this conference possible,"" he said. Syria's Deputy Prime Minister said last week that the ""presumed dates"" had been agreed to during a conference at the Russian Foreign Ministry. Brahimi said Sunday that he plans to meet with Russian and U.S. officials as well other representatives of the U.N. Security Council to finalize details. He also stressed that no meeting could be held without a ""convincing opposition that represents Syria's opposition population.""","NEW: Syrian opposition leader says opposition groups will meet to decide on their approach .

"(CNN) -- ""The Voice"" crowned Texas teen Danielle Bradbery its new winner on Tuesday, proving to the country singer that she could do what she'd thought to be impossible. ""I remember singing in my room to my wall, just acting like there's so many people out there even though I knew I could never do that,"" Bradbery told CNN after her big win. ""My mom wanted to do something about my voice, and signed me up and we took a road trip to Dallas for 'The Voice' (auditions) not knowing what was going to happen. I was scared to death. And it led to me being the winner, and that is unbelievable."" The 16-year-old claimed the title during Tuesday's finale of the NBC singing competition, which was packed with performances from Cher, Bruno Mars and ""Voice"" coach Christina Aguilera, who will return to the series next season after a short hiatus. Bradbery is ""The Voice's"" youngest winner, and also the third victor in a row from coach Blake Shelton's team. Shelton, who was celebrating his 37th birthday on Tuesday, told CNN that he doesn't try to win as much as he tries to build a team that excites him. ""This year, I finally got the country team that I dreamed of since day one, and I have a little bit more knowledge about that than I had in the past,"" he said. ""But the truth is, anybody could win if they have Danielle Bradbery. She's just an incredible, God-given gift to the music industry. Anybody who can sing like that, with almost no experience whatsoever coming into this thing, is very special. Any producer, no matter what genre, would be thankful to work with somebody that talented."" New ""The Voice"" coach Usher Raymond saw one of his mentees, Michelle Chamuel, land in second place, while the Swon Brothers from Shelton's team came in third. The show itself was a huge ratings winner for NBC on Tuesday, as the finale pulled in 15.3 million viewers. That marked ""The Voice's"" most-watched finale to date, and it also surpasses the 14.3 million who watched ""American Idol's"" 12th season finale on Fox in May. That veteran singing competition is undergoing a slew of changes, as Fox has announced that longtime producer Nigel Lythgoe is departing ""Idol,"" along with judges Randy Jackson, Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj. But perhaps the updates will benefit ""Idol"" in the same way it's worked for ""The Voice,"" which temporarily brought in Usher and Shakira as coaches this season in place of Aguilera and Cee Lo Green. ""People thought we were crazy to switch up something that was working,"" host Carson Daly told CNN, ""But ... it's about American families. I think people feel guilty that there's not enough connectivity between their kids and themselves, and maybe their parents if they're still around. There's not a lot of great TV on network primetime that brings them all together. If you can figure out how to do that, and I think 'The Voice' has, then you're doing something right.""

"(CNN) -- Not everyone gets it. But for some of us, travel is best expressed through celebration. We prefer to exchange culture over the clinking of glasses and between the flashes of strobe lights. Conversations punctuated by ""Prost!"" and ""Salud!"" show us more than any guidebook. I view myself as a kind of international nightlife connoisseur. As an entrepreneur, author and all-around life enthusiast, I've been around the world many times over. And of everyone I know, I feel the most qualified to throw an absurd list like this together. Each city is judged on four criteria, each given a score from one-to-10 . 1. Hours. How late each night and how many nights per week is the party good? 2. People. Is it a good crowd -- cosmopolitan, friendly and, yes, good looking? 3. Music. Judged on quality and variety offered in each city. 4. Experience. How likely you are to have an experience that you'll still be telling your friends about a decade from now. I'm embarrassed to admit how much time I spent on this list (seriously, there was an Excel spreadsheet involved), but I finally narrowed it to 10 cities and I'm confident with the end result. First, my honorary mentions: Hong Kong, Sydney, Miami, Stockholm, Tokyo and Tel Aviv. My apologies party people, but the competition was stiff. 10. Bangkok . Hours: 7 . People: 5 . Music: 5 . Experience: 10 . Total: 27 . A lot of travelers continue to pass through Bangkok not realizing there's more to it than the seedy dregs of Soi Cowboy, or the backpacker haven of Khao San Road. Bangkok has developed a vibrant and classy side as the city has become more cosmopolitan. Whether it's a series of gorgeous rooftop hotel bars downtown, rock bars near Ratchathewi, dance clubs just off Sukhumvit or trendy pubs in Thlonglor and Ekamai, there's legitimate, quality adventure to be had. Best place to mingle with the locals: The young kids prefer RCA, while many of the city's beautiful people are drawn to the clubs on Sukhumvit Soi 11 or upscale Ku De Ta, among others. 9. Buenos Aires . Hours: 9 . People: 7 . Music: 6 . Experience: 7 . Total: 29 . ""The Paris of the South"" puts a New World spin on the insane Spanish practice of eating dinner at midnight and then dancing until dawn. While living there, I remember trying to go home as the sun came up and an Argentinian friend telling me she wanted to go to an after-party instead. It was eight in the morning. On a Wednesday. Although not as affordable as it used to be, Buenos Aires is still a relative bargain among major world cities. The locals love good rock music, too. Best itinerary: Start with the calmer bars of Recoleta and work your way up to the taverns of Palermo Hollywood. There's no rush, believe me. 8. Las Vegas . Hours: 8 . People: 8 . Music: 6 . Experience: 9 . Total: 31 . A staple. No nightlife list would be complete without it. Sin City has something for everybody, from NBA power forwards blowing their signing bonuses to middle-agers gambling their way through a midlife crisis. I tend to stick to the southern end of the strip -- Marquee, XS, Tao -- but it's hard to have a bad night out in Vegas. Best place to waste your life savings and love every second of it: XS in the Encore. Get to this nightclub early or suffer through the two-hour line. 7. Montreal . Hours: 8 . People: 8 . Music: 8 . Experience: 8 . Total: 32 . Montreal is the undiscovered party gem of North America. Beautiful, friendly people, all night dancing to a wide variety of music. And, of course, the summer festivals. Obvious tip, but still good to keep in mind: Don't go in winter. Best place to learn why the French do it better: Wood 35. Good drinks, good food. 6. Barcelona . Hours: 9 . People: 8 . Music: 8 . Experience: 7 . Total: 32 . The first rule of Barcelona is that you don't stay on Las Ramblas. The second rule of Barcelona is that you don't stay on Las Ramblas. Guidebooks and pub crawls funnel the least savvy visitors there. Other parts of the city are far more interesting at night. Well, early morning. Clubs don't get going until well past 1 a.m. each day. Most of the top clubs are scattered throughout the northern part of the city. Best place to wake up early for: Row 14. Doesn't get going until 6 a.m. 5. London . Hours: 9 . People: 6 . Music: 10 . Experience: 7 . Total: 32 . The world epicenter of corner pubs touts some of the ritziest and most prestigious nightclubs in the world. You can enjoy fantastic music almost any night of the week here. And there will always be the pubs. Best place to suffer local pretension: Chinawhite.

Sao Paulo is the dark horse on this list. Often overshadowed by its more beautiful and glamorous sister, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo is actually the cultural hub of Brazil. The city's glory isn't apparent upon arrival. The place isn't beautiful. But dig into the sprawling concrete mass and you'll find greater diversity and intensity on a nightly basis than almost any other place in the world.

Although it's not true that the ""city never sleeps"" (it's usually done by 3 or 4 a.m.), New York City scores big simply because it offers something for everybody on any night of the week. Warehouse parties in Brooklyn, mega-clubs in Meatpacking, trendy hipster joints in the East Village, hotel lounges, college bars, indie rock shows, loft parties, hip hop and jazz, heavy metal and opera -- there's almost no limit to the ways this city entertains you.

If a city's mental health was determined by how many hours of the week its clubs weren't active, Berlin would be a lunatic in a straightjacket, repeatedly slamming its head against a padded wall. Witness: walking out of a venue at 9 a.m. on a Sunday to find that there's still a line to get in; a club with beds installed on its bottom floor so patrons can sleep without the inconvenience of having to leave; ceilings made completely of LED lights; a swimming pool next to the dance floor; bouncers with face tattoos.

Every party hound must make a pilgrimage to Ibiza at least once. The venues aren't as much clubs as they are life experiences. Nowhere else have I seen a wind tunnel built into a dance floor or parade floats and foam dropped from the ceiling like it's the Fourth of July indoors. In Ibiza, you do beach parties during the day, hotel bars in the evening and dance to the best DJs in the world all night. Sleep not recommended.

"(CNN) -- Hailed as the horse ""the Germans could not kill"" after surviving machine gun attacks and falling shells, one of World War I's most famous animals has been honored with its own version of Britain's most prestigious medal the Victoria Cross. Warrior, who arrived on the Western Front on August 11, 1914, with his owner and rider General Jack Seely endured the horrors of the Battle of the Somme and was rescued twice at Passchendaele after becoming trapped in his stables. After suffering a number of injuries, Warrior returned home to the Isle of Wight in 1918 where he lived until he passed away at the age of 33, and the horse has now been honored by being awarded an Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal. Warrior's life has been used as an inspiration by the likes of film director Steven Spielberg, whose film Warhorse won critical acclaim and was nominated for an Oscar. ""Warrior is an extraordinary example of the resilience, strength, and profound contribution that horses made to the Great War,"" Spielberg said. ""Recognizing him with an Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal is a fitting and poignant tribute not only to this remarkable animal, but to all animals that served."" The film, which was based on the 1982 novel by Michael Morpurgo, is one of the most famous of its kind as it tells the tale of Joey, a horse which serves in WW1. It's the first time that the PDSA Dickin Medal has been awarded to an animal who served on the front line during conflict in the veterinary charity's 97-year history. The medal was accepted by Seely's grandson, Brough Scott, who is a horse racing journalist and broadcaster. The ceremony was held at London's Imperial War Museum where the horse was honored 100 years after he began his journey into war. ""Warrior's story - which I grew up hearing at my mothers' knee -- was lost in time to the wider world. But now he rides again 100 years later, thanks to PDSA,"" said Scott. ""My family and I are more than honored that Warrior has been given this award on behalf of all animals that also served; we are truly humbled. I only wish Jack Seely were here today to witness Warrior receiving the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross."" Warrior is the 66th winner of the medal from the PDSA but is the first to receive an honorary award and the first to have done so having been involved in WW1. Since its introduction, 65 Dickin Medals have been awarded to 29 dogs, 32 Pigeons who flew in World War II, three horses and a cat. The most recent recipient was Sasha, a military dog, who died while on patrol in Afghanistan.","Warrior honored by animals version of Victoria Cross .

"(CNN) -- You're in town for business and have a few hours between meetings. Not long enough to head out sightseeing, but too long to swipe aimlessly at your iPad in the lobby. Luckily, some of the world's best city hotels offer the kind of leisure facilities that let you fool yourself into thinking you're kicking back at a resort -- at least until your reminder app tells you otherwise. 1. Palacio Duhau -- Park Hyatt (Buenos Aires) Just 15 minutes from the central business district, this gorgeous hotel was once the palace of the aristocratic Duhau family. Built in 1934, more than half the Palacio Duhau's land is dedicated to a cascading garden, where you can slow down and smell the roses (literally). To aid procrastination on that report, there's an indoor pool -- heated to a constant 28 degrees Celsius (82.4 F) -- while the hotel's Duhau Restaurante & Vinoteca features 7,000 bottles of Argentinean wine. For the more culturally inclined, there's the hotel's underground art gallery. Palacio Duhau - Park Hyatt Buenos Aires, Avenida Alvear 1661, Buenos Aires, Argentina; +54 11 5171 1234 . 2. The Siam (Bangkok) In a city notorious for its traffic, this riverside urban resort offers guests a scenic way to commute -- via converted rice barge from the hotel's private pier on the Chao Phraya River. You can watch the world float by from a poolside sun lounger next to the river, or better yet, from the private rooftop terrace of the river view pool villa, which also comes with an internal courtyard garden and plunge pool. With the hotel's art deco design accents, antique collections, a Musee d'Orsay-inspired main building and a restaurant housed in a series of ancient teakwood houses, you'll soon forget you're in the heart of a big, chaotic city. The Siam, 3/2 Thanon Khao, Vachirapayabal, Dusit, Bangkok; +66 2206 6999 . 3. Hotel Molitor (Paris) Ever since it first opened in 1929 as a public swim and socializing hotspot, this art deco-meets-industrial chic hotel has been synonymous with fab pools. On a fine summer's day, one can relax by the 46-meter outdoor pool, enclosed by the building's high floors of rooms -- each with porthole windows -- and imagine you're sailing the seas in a luxury cruise liner. There's also a glass-roofed 33-meter-long indoor pool. Its pools are so legendary that the main character of ""The Life of Pi"" (full name Piscine Molitor ""Pi"" Patel) was named after the place. A rooftop garden terrace overlooks another Parisian icon, the Eiffel Tower. Hotel Molitor, 13 Rue Nungesser et Coli, Paris; +33 1 5607 0850 . 4. The Castle Hotel (Dalian, China) Who would've guessed there's a mountaintop Bavarian getaway just 15 minutes from the CBD of this major Chinese metropolis? Inspired by Neuschwanstein Castle, once home to Germany's King Ludwig II, the Luxury Collection hotel was originally built in 2002 to house a museum. Everything about the place is over-the-top. Statues of Greek gods pepper the magnificent gardens, an extravagant marble lobby features a grand double staircase and opulent chandeliers. The Yellow Sea views are best enjoyed from the Royal Cellar pub with a frothy pint, or from the 4,850 square foot (450 square meter) indoor heated pool. The Castle Hotel, 600 Binhai W. Road, Shahekou District, Dalian, Liaoning, China; +86 411 8656 0000 . 5. The Houstonian Hotel (Houston, Texas) Proving that everything is big in Texas, guests of The Houstonian Hotel enjoy unlimited access to a sprawling 175,000 square foot fitness club, touted as one of the nation's best, and a 17,000 square foot spa. The hotel is set amongst 18 acres of wooded landscape and has three outdoor pools. To make your boss question if you even bothered to get any work done, Instagram a photo of the Resort Pool, complete with waterfalls and a slide, or the tranquil Garden Pool, set amongst beautiful landscaping. The hotel is so relaxing that U.S. former President George Bush Sr. and his wife Barbara made it their official voting residence for more than 10 years. The Houstonian Hotel, 111 N. Post Oak Lane, Houston, Texas; +1 713 680 2626 . 6. Hotel Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro) Business travelers looking for an alternative base might be tempted to make a beeline to the sexy shores of Copacabana or Ipanema, but for another side of Rio, there's the winding pebbled streets and bohemian neighborhood of Santa Teresa. The boutique Hotel Santa Teresa was once a colonial coffee ranch. It's since been transformed into a tropical chic property with 40 rooms and suites. This one's a bit far from Rio's Centro business district -- 40 minutes by car -- but worth the extra commute time. For the most stunning views in Rio, we recommend heading for the outdoor pool during sunset, which overlooks Santa Teresa Hill, Centro and down to Guanabara Bay. Caiprinihas optional but highly recommended. Hotel Santa Teresa, Rua Almirante Alexandrino, 660, Santa Teresa, Rio de Janeiro; +55 21 3380 0200 . 7. The Berkeley (London) Granted, London's weather might not be ideal for al fresco poolside lounging -- hence the prevalence of subterranean pools -- but on beautiful summer days, nothing beats lounging by the only rooftop hotel pool in the city at The Berkeley. At 10 by 5 meters, it's not the largest, but the views over Knightsbridge and Hyde Park make up for it. A selection of poolside light bites and drinks will be enough to tide you over while you top up your tan before your business lunch at the two-Michelin starred Marcus downstairs. The Berkeley, Wilton Place, Knightsbridge, London; +44 20 7235 6000 . 8. The Ritz-Carlton (Singapore) Situated steps from Marina Bay, this hotel features a 25-meter outdoor pool surrounded by enough tropical foliage that you'd never know you were in the heart of the lion city. If you'd rather indulge in watery pleasures in the privacy of your own room, there's the butler-drawn bath -- treatments complete with accompaniments (Champagne, strawberries and roses for one, Cohiba cigars and Cognac for another). Marble bathrooms in the bay view rooms overlook the iconic Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel and city skyline through exhibitionist-friendly windows. The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, 7 Raffles Ave., Singapore; +65 6337 8888 . 9. W Santiago (Santiago) Following the fashionable formula of designer hotels with heavy tints of cool, W Santiago pops with colors and design quirks that will snap you out of suited-and-booted work mode in no time. You can't escape the Andes, wherever you are in the city, but the contrast of majestic snow-capped peaks and the trendy rooftop pool area on the 21st floor -- bathed in electronic lounge music and shrink-wrapped within the city/mountain panorama -- is as sweet as a year-end bonus. To include the LED-lit infinity pool in your sights, the so-cool rooftop bar is a great place for a deserving nightcap. W Santiago, Isidora Goyenechea 3000, Las Condes, Santiago, Chile; +56 2 2770 0000 . 10. Hotel Arts Barcelona (Barcelona) Aside from being the tallest building in the country, Hotel Arts Barcelona is easily identifiable thanks to a Frank Gehry-designed golden steel installation. The outdoor pool, set amongst a palm tree-landscaped garden, sits under the shimmering shadow of said fish statue, overlooking the Med. The recently-launched 43 the Spa offers even better vistas from the sauna room, plus therapies such as a technology-detox treatment to counter the effects of smartphone appendage-itis. Stay in one of the club rooms and you'll have use of a Smart electric car to make that five-minute drive into the city center for meetings. Hotel Arts Barcelona, Carrer de la Marina, 19-21, Barcelona, Spain; +34 93 221 10 00 . 11. Villa Kennedy (Frankfurt, Germany) Unusual for a city residence, this restored former banking family's home features a verdant central courtyard (the ""Villa Garden"") with a giant oak tree as its centerpiece. Terraced suites and deluxe rooms overlook over this urban oasis, while over at the serene 1,000 square meter Villa Spa, you can turn off your phone and pretend you're on a luxury wellness retreat as you lounge on the mezzanine relaxation area overlooking the 15-meter Portuguese marble pool. The hotel is located just 5 minutes from the city center and 10 minutes to the airport, which makes getting back to reality a bittersweet convenience.

"Washington (CNN) -- ""I'm just a bill. Yes I am only a bill. And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill."" ""Conjunction Junction, what's your function."" ""My hero, zero."" ""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly get your adverbs here."" These are some of the lyrics that live on 40 years after they premiered on Saturday mornings on ABC television as part of ""Schoolhouse Rock."" They were animated videos and songs invented by a jazz musician who wanted to help children learn math. Kids never really had any idea they were learning how a bill becomes a law or proper grammar while watching the three-minute shorts between cartoons. Jazz pianist and vocalist Bob Dorough was approached in 1971 by a New York advertising executive whose sons could not multiply. He asked him to set the multiplication tables to music. Dorough ended up writing ""Three's a Magic Number"" and other well known videos. He also voiced many of them. Dorough, who is 89 and still performs, said he gets requests from adults to sing some of the bits because they grew up on them -- often times recognizing his voice. ""I am not surprised at all (that the videos still resonate),"" Dorough told CNN. ""I learned, when performing at elementary schools, that they were 'getting through,' so to speak, and the children would readily recognize my voice on such vocals as 'Three is a Magic Number,' and others that I sang. ""However, what surprised me most was the impact of network television, which kicked in years later, after we'd been on air at ABC-TV. Thirteen years, plus a second round, helped us to reach literally thousands, in a rather broad age spectrum."" ""Schoolhouse Rock"" premiered on Jan. 13, 1973, and ran on ABC from 1973-1985. It came back in the 1990s for five more years. More than 30 million people have now watched some of them on YouTube, showing that Dorough's work still resonates. It is not just the catchy words that connected with kids. They were combined with interesting visuals. One spot featured a talking ""bill"" that explained to a boy how he could only become a law by passing both houses of Congress and then going to the White House hoping the president would sign him. ""Conjunction Junction"" used train cars named ""and,"" ""but"" and ""or"" that illustrated how a conjunction connected words. Asked why the videos connected, Dorough said, ""The melodies, words, arrangements, and players. That is to say, even though they were in a 'rock' or 'pop' bag, my jazz sensibilities and the fine musicians I used for the audio recordings made the songs seem unusual to the Saturday morning cartoon listeners."" Just last week, there was a vivid example of just how popular the videos remain. More than a thousand people -- adults who wanted to relive part of their childhood and parents who wanted to share the fun with their kids -- jammed into the lobby of the Kennedy Center to hear Dorough sing ""Three's a Magic Number"" and ""Figure Eight is Double 4."" ""I came because I had such fond, intense memories,"" said Amy Augenblick, who brought her 9-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. ""I could sing all of it without the words.""","In 1973, a jazz musician created the popular children's short videos to help kids learn math .

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius has been sending the family of Reeva Steenkamp, the girlfriend he fatally shot last year, a monthly payment since March 2013, a probation officer told his sentencing hearing in South Africa on Tuesday. Probation officer and social worker Annette Vergeer told the court that Pistorius' legal team had told her about the payments, of 6,000 rand (about $540) a month, and she suggested that this showed remorse. She said Pistorius had offered the family more besides the monthly payments. The athlete sold his car for about $35,000 and had that money given to the Steenkamp family, she said. Pistorius' manager, Peet van Zyl, facilitated the monthly payments from Pistorius' bank account. However, the Steenkamp family has rejected the money, the court heard. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said that Reeva's mother, June Steenkamp, had said she didn't want ""blood money."" He told the court that Steenkamp's parents had said they would repay the monthly payments in full. The Steenkamp family, through a lawyer, told Vergeer that it was ""neutral"" on the sentencing phase of the trial, Vergeer said. She told the court that neither of Reeva Steenkamp's parents would testify for the state at the hearing. Pistorius 'vulnerable' in prison . Judge Thokozile Masipa, who presided over Pistorius' high-profile trial and delivered the verdict last month, will decide his sentence, which may or may not see him spend time behind bars. The hearing, which began Monday, is likely to take several days, as the prosecution and defense put their arguments before the court. Vergeer argued that Pistorius should not be sent to prison, saying that as a double amputee, he would be vulnerable to gang rape -- particularly if his prosthetic legs were taken away. Nel suggested that if Pistorius were allowed to keep his prosthetic legs while in prison, he'd be fine. But Vergeer said that even if the court allowed Pistorius to keep the legs, there was no guarantee the order would be complied with. Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally, but unlawfully, killing a person. However, the judge cleared him of murder in Steenkamp's death and granted him bail pending the sentencing hearing. 'Broken man' On Monday, a psychologist said Pistorius was a ""broken man"" after the death of his girlfriend, as his defense tried to convince a judge of his fragile emotional state. Dr. Lore Hartzenberg said the Olympian described Steenkamp as the love of his life. He lost faith in himself and his abilities after the killing, she said. But the prosecution dismissed her findings. ""We're dealing with a broken man, but he's still alive,"" Nel said in an apparent reference to the fact that Steenkamp is not. ""He has lost his love relationship ... but he will be able to love somebody else like that."" Sentence hard to predict . There is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. CNN's Robyn Curnow contributed to this report.","Probation officer: Pistorius has been making monthly payments to Steenkamp family .

"(CNN) -- I'm a lover of books, great ones and not-so-great ones. And I also love lists. So it didn't surprise me when Amazon recently came out with its 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime. I was, however, more than a little shocked by the list, which crudely mixes categories, putting in a few classics, such as George Orwell's ""1984"" and Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations,"" alongside ""Kitchen Confidential"" by Anthony Bourdain, ""Moneyball"" by Michael Lewis, and ""Gone Girl"" by Gillian Flynn. Really? And do you think ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" by Eric Carle should sit on the shelf of must-reads-before-dying with ""Pride and Prejudice,"" the great masterpiece by Jane Austen? In the novel category, should one read Jacqueline Suzann's truly terrible ""Valley of the Dolls"" instead of, say, Mark Twain's ""Huckleberry Finn"" or -- the greatest of all novels -- ""Middlemarch"" by George Eliot? For poetry, Amazon recommends Shel Silverstein's ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" instead of the poems of Robert Frost or Walt Whitman or Emily Dickinson. For a great biography, we get Robert A. Caro's admirable life of Robert Moses. But what about James Boswell's ""Life of Johnson,"" arguably the finest biography ever published? Certain books here are familiar to high school students, including ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Slaughterhouse-Five,"" and ""Catcher in the Rye."" I don't myself like any of these much, if truth be told. One of my sons recently graduated from high school, and he complained that in the past six years he had been asked every single year to read ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Surely there are other books about race relations in the American South? I also wonder about including so many recent popular novels, such as Jonathan Franzen's ""The Corrections"" or ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"" by Junot Diaz or, even more puzzling, ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt. These books made a splash, and continue to find readers, but any one of a dozen or more books could have been substituted for these, and the books in this category would certainly change with the decades. In the '20s, everyone thought you should read ""Java Head"" by Joseph Hergesheimer. In the '30s, you would have been asked to read ""Seven Who Fled"" by Frederic Prokosch. I liked certain choices here, however: Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried"" is certainly the best book about Vietnam; more than that, it's a dazzling work of art. John Irving's ""The World According to Garp"" will always deserve readers, as will ""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy and ""Lolita"" by Vladimir Nabokov. But are these the 100 books you must read before you die or the 100 books Amazon will probably sell you before you die? The latter, I think. If you're going to die soon, I suggest reading ""Walden"" by Henry David Thoreau, which didn't make Amazon's list. It's a sublime work of literature, a better memoir than any of the memoirs included here. And read ""The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin"" before you read ""The Liars' Club"" by Mary Carr or ""The Year of Magical Thinking"" by Joan Didion. The latter are fine books, but they should not crowd out Thoreau or Franklin. It's sad to see that Shakespeare and Tolstoy don't make the Amazon list. Nor do John Updike or Saul Bellow or Mark Twain. I'd say that only about a third of the books on Amazon's list are in any way essential reading. Buy these books, if you must. And die, if you must. But if you want to know what books you should really read before you die, look elsewhere. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","Amazon recently came out with its ""100 Books to Read in a Lifetime""

"(CNN) -- If you received shiny new gadgets for the holidays, you probably have some older device that is now unwanted or obsolete. If you can't regift your old computer, tablet or TV, make sure you get rid of it the smart way by selling, donating or recycling it. Before you part ways with your device, make sure to wipe it clean and permanently delete any personal data. Sell for cash . If you'd like cash in exchange for your gently used gadgets, you can sell them online. How much money you earn depends largely on how much time and effort you're willing to put into hawking the device. It's easy to get caught up trying to get the best possible price for your old iPad or smartphone, and before you know it you've wasted a chunk of your holiday vacation jockeying for an extra $50. Selling directly on sites such as Craigslist, eBay or Amazon can net the best prices, but it also comes with its own set of hassles, including the time commitment required to sign up and create a listing, as well dealing with flaky buyers. Technology depreciates quickly, so you're unlikely to make back the full $500 you spent on an iPad 2 just last year. To find out how much you can get, look at past eBay auctions for the same item. Do a search for the gadget name and select ""Completed Listings"" from the Show Only menu, then select the auction tab at the top of the list. Prices will vary according to condition. For example, an unopened Nexus 7 in the box recently went for $251, while a Nexus 7 with a cracked screen sold for just $81. You can also check Pricenomics.com to see a list of current sales and a handy chart showing the average price of the device over time. For an easier but less lucrative selling experience, consider using one of the many sites that specialize in buying used electronics. Gazelle.com buys back Apple products and some third party smartphones. NextWorth buys back iPhones and iPads, as well as cameras, e-readers, game consoles and other products. It will pay around $74 for a Nexus 7 in good condition. If you have an old cell phone, try ReCelluar. Buy back kiosks are popping up across the U.S. EcoATM examines your device and offers a price based on its condition. If you decide to sell it, you'll drop in you device and receive cash right away. You can search for the nearest EcoATM on the company's website. Trade for credit . If you're going to use any profits to buy even more technology, trade-ins can offer a better deal than selling. Most major electronic retailers have established trade-in programs that offer store credit toward a future purchase. First check with the manufacturer of your device to see what kinds of prices they're offering. Apple has a Reuse and Recycling program that offers Apple Store credit for your old iPads, iPhones, iPods and computers. Wireless carriers including AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon buy back old phones for store credit. Amazon's trade-in site will buy back Kindles as well a variety of other electronics. It even takes video games, music and movies. In exchange, you're issued an Amazon.com gift card that you can use for any product on Amazon. Other electronic retailers such as Best Buy, Game Stop, Target and Radio Shack offer store credit for phones, tablets, computers, TVs and more. Donate for karma . You might not do much with the hundred or so dollars you get for that used laptop, but a local school or library could benefit greatly from having more working computers. There are many options for donating your old devices, from local charities to larger established programs. Goodwill and Dell teamed up for the Reconnect program, which accepts donated computers at select Goodwill locations. The official site has a full list of items it will accept and locations near you. The Salvation Army also accepts used computers and electronics. If you're donating a cell phone, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Cell Phones for Soldiers and the 911 Cell Phone Bank are just some of the many charitable projects that can do good with your old handset. You can also call local schools or community centers directly to see if they accept donations. AmericanCellPhoneDrive.org will find nearby organizations accepting phone donations. Recycle for the environment . If your device is too old or damaged to sell, don't just chuck it into the trash can, recycle it. Most governments offer local options for electronics recycling. Check in your area for schedules and drop off locations. Recycling keeps dangerous chemicals out of landfills and saves natural resources by cutting down on mining and minimizing pollution resulting from manufacturing. (Recycle any batteries separately.) Many electronics manufacturers also have mail-in and drop-off recycling programs for their old devices, including Apple, Samsung and Sony. Wireless carriers will take old flip phones at no cost. Head to the nearest Best Buy and they will take electronics off your hands for free. In-person drop offs are also available at Office Depot and Staples, though sometimes a small fee will be charged to cover the cost of processing.","You can sell old computers, tablets and phones online for cash .

"(CNN) -- It is disheartening and alarming to learn that as many as 7,000 patients are at risk of serious, life-threatening infections because of dentist W. Scott Harrington's alleged failure to follow ""standard infection control guidelines"" at his practice in a Tulsa, Oklahoma, suburb. Around the country, people are asking: Are U.S. oral health services safe? The short answer is: Yes. But, patients should always check to make sure that their dental provider adheres to the strictest safety guidelines. The allegations leveled against Harrington are deeply troubling, and it is terrible that his many patients must now worry they might have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV because of his alleged failure to implement even the most basic infection control guidelines. As the leader of his oral health care team, it was his responsibility to ensure the safety of the patients who trusted him with their care. Dental patients tested for hepatitis, HIV exposure . Considering that there are 175,000 practicing dentists in the United States, it would be easy to argue that Harrington is an outlier and statistically insignificant. However, one outlier is one too many, and the lives he might have put at risk are anything but insignificant. But generally, dental care in the United States is among the best in the world. Along with the privilege and tremendous rewards of being a health care professional comes the awesome responsibility of providing the highest quality of care possible. Dental practices, as with any medical practice, must make sure that safety is a priority. As we approach the graduation season, dental schools in the United States will welcome more than 4,000 new colleagues to our profession. All schools are held to the standards promulgated by the Commission on Dental Accreditation that address patient safety. Training in and implementation of patient safety protocols is an important component of any dental school education. Upon graduation, the dental education community certifies that new dentists are competent to independently provide oral health care. They should be able to put into practice the knowledge, skills and experiences they have gained. The very basics of infection control are not complicated to understand or implement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a very clear and practical document that most practitioners utilize to develop protocols in their practices. In addition, the Organization of Safety, Asepsis and Prevention is a wonderful resource for information and training. All states require that licensed dentists participate in continuing education to maintain that license to practice. Many states, such as Massachusetts, require a portion of this continuing education to be focused on infection control. Dental schools, organized groups such as the American Dental Association, licensing boards and other dental organizations have made patient safety a priority during the past 25 years. In the array of health care providers, dentists have an admirable record of providing high-quality care in a safe environment. Patients should feel confident that their care will be provided in a safe environment and that there is infinitesimal risk of transmission of disease. However, as one seeks any health care services, patients must ask questions about the provider, his or her staff, facility, training and compliance with infection control guidelines. Any capable and qualified dentist would welcome such questions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Hanley.","A dentist in Oklahoma has put up to 7,000 patients at risk for serious infections .

"(CNN) -- Hours after his family members alerted police to a human head and two hands they discovered stashed in metal tins, a Maryland man admitted killing his housemate, cutting him up, then eating his heart and part of his brain, authorities said. Alexander Kinyua, 21, was being held without bail at the Harford County Detention Center after being charged with first-degree murder, first-degree assault and second-degree assault. Calls to his public defender Friday morning were not immediately returned. Suspect in Canada body parts probe described as 'creepy' and a kitten-killer . His roommate, Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie, had left his Joppatowne home six days earlier for an apparent early morning jog. Wearing a T-shirt and shorts, he left his wallet, cell phone and identification at home. On Tuesday, Antony Kinyua -- Alexander Kinyua's father -- called a Harford County detective assigned to the missing person's case and told him about his other son's gruesome discovery. Miami mother: My son 'is no zombie' According to the charging document, the other son explained to the detective how he had come across two metal tins covered by a blanket in the basement laundry room of Agyei-Kodie's Joppatowne residence. He opened the tins and found the head and hands. The brother said he ""confronted (Alexander Kinyua), who denied the remains were human,"" then went upstairs to get his father, the detective said in the charging document. When the father and son returned to the basement, ""the items he observed were gone and ... Alex Kinyua was cleaning the container he observed them in."" Two Harford County detectives later arrived on the scene and discovered the head and hands on the home's main floor. Reports: Miami 'zombie' attacker may have been using 'bath salts' ""He admitted to killing our missing person, Mr. Kodie, and cutting him up with a knife,"" Harford County Sheriff Jesse Bane told reporters Thursday. ""He further stated that he consumed Mr. Kodie's internal organs -- specifically his heart and portions of his brain."" The suspect told detectives to go to the parking lot of the nearby Town Baptist Church, where they could -- and did -- find the rest of Agyei-Kodie's remains in a dumpster. The missing person's report filed Saturday described the 37-year-old Agyei-Kodie as ""very intelligent."" He had earned multiple master's degrees from schools in Ghana and was also a graduate student at Morgan State University, even though he wasn't taking classes there at the time of his death. Kinyua was affiliated with the same state university in Baltimore. The engineering student was one of 175 people showcased in an August 2011 symposium run by the prestigious Los Alamos National Laboratory. His study focused on the cost-effectiveness and productivity of ""comfort control"" systems regulating heating, ventilation and air conditioning.","Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie, 37, was reported missing last Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Actor Ron Palillo, who played class clown Arnold Horshack on the 1970s television comedy ""Welcome Back, Kotter,"" has died at age 63, his agent said Tuesday. Palillo died of a heart attack in the Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, area, where he had moved to live near his mother and was active in the theater, his agent, Scott Stander, told CNN. He was best known for his role as one of the ""Sweathogs"" -- remedial students at a Brooklyn high school -- on the 1975-79 show, which starred Gabe Kaplan and launched the career of fellow Sweathog John Travolta. Palillo's ""Oooh! Oooh!"" appeals for attention became the character's catchphrase. Stander called Palillo ""upbeat, fun, a great friend who loved theater, loved the fans and had a great sense of humor."" He taught acting to high school students at the G-Star School of the Arts, a charter school in West Palm Beach, Stander said. Palillo made numerous guest appearances on television in the following decades, including playing himself in three episodes of the Ellen DeGeneres comedy ""Ellen"" in 1996. He also appeared on the reality show ""Celebrity Boxing"" in 2002, losing by a TKO to former ""Saved by the Bell"" actor Dustin Diamond. Another of the original Sweathogs, Robert Hegyes, died in January at age 60. Hegyes, who played Juan Epstein, also played a detective in the late 1980s police drama ""Cagney & Lacey.""

"A soak in a steamy tub, surrounded by candles sure seems like a great way to unwind. But new research suggests that burning certain kinds of candles may generate indoor air pollutants. Frequently lighting many candles in an unventilated space could lead to problems, say the study researchers. Researchers at South Carolina State University studied petroleum-based and vegetable-source candles to determine their emissions. They let candles from different manufacturers burn for up to six hours in a small box (8 inches x 8 inches x 26 inches), and then collected and analyzed substances released into the air. They found that paraffin-based candles -- the most popular kind -- emitted toxic chemicals like toluene and benzene. Soybean candles did not, according to the study, which was presented this week at the American Chemical Society meeting in Washington, D.C. Candles made of beeswax or soybean tend to make mention of that ingredient on their label; paraffin candles may not. The researchers say that lighting a paraffin candle once in a while is unlikely to pose a health threat. However, frequently lighting many candles in an unventilated space could lead to problems, and may aggravate asthma, cause allergy-like symptoms, or irritate the respiratory tract. Health.com: 10 ways to fight indoor mold . However, whether some candles are safer than others is still debatable, according to one expert. ""I think there's some controversy out there as to which candles are better than others,"" says George Thurston, Ph.D., an associate professor of environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine. Thurston urges people to be prudent about lighting any kind of candle -- whether it's paraffin, beeswax, or soybean -- in an enclosed space. ""Just lighting a match to start a candle creates sulfur pollution in the air,"" he adds. ""It's one of the big sources of sulfur in the indoor environment, so using a lighter would probably be cleaner."" Health.com: Why belly fat is bad for your lungs . While you aren't putting your life on the line by lighting a candle, he says you should exercise at least some caution. ""You ought to try to minimize your exposure to paraffin wax candles,"" says Thurston. ""And when you light any kind of candle, you might turn on the exhaust fan; even if it ruins the mood, it vents out the fumes. People just need to use common sense."" Candles are only one potential source of indoor air pollution. ""A lot of household products give off volatile organic compounds, or VOCs,"" says David Rosenstreich, M.D., the director of the division of allergy and immunology at New York's Montefiore Medical Center. Cleaning products, hair sprays, and mousses all contribute to indoor air pollution. ""We live in a highly chemically infused environment where people use tons of products,"" he adds. ""Just because it's on the supermarket shelves doesn't mean it's safe."" Central heating and cooling systems, as well as gas fireplaces, can generate indoor air pollution too. ""People have these fake fireplaces that are unventilated and the pollution just sits in the room,"" says Thurston. ""You need ventilation, just like you do with candles."" Health.com: Air purifier buying guide . People with respiratory problems such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should make an extra effort to cut down on indoor air pollution, says Rosenstreich. And it's easier than it sounds. ""You can wipe down your counter with a little soap and water,"" he says. ""You don't need to use these powerful cleaners."" He also suggests ventilating your home as naturally as possible by opening the windows at night once the house has cooled down. ""That way you're not breathing in the same old stale air,"" he says. If you are prone to outdoor allergies, use a filter in your central air and heating systems to cut down on dust. Simply thinking twice about the chemical products you use in your home can go a long way toward improving air quality. ""A lot of things we take for granted aren't really safe at all,"" Rosenstreich says. Barbara Miller, a spokesperson for the National Candle Association, says ""no candle wax has ever been shown to be dangerous or harmful to human health."" ""Paraffin wax is neither toxic nor carcinogenic,"" says Miller. ""All types of properly formulated candle wax have been shown to burn cleanly and safely."" Health.com: How to make your own all-natural home cleaners . She notes that a 2007 industry-funded study found that none of the candle waxes tested -- including paraffin, soy wax, and beeswax -- produced benzene. The levels of volatile organic compounds were less than 2 percent of the indoor air-quality standard. In that study, nine 6-ounce candles of each type containing no fragrance or dyes were burned simultaneously in a test chamber. The test simulated four hours of daily burning of one container candle in a room about 1765 cubic feet (50 cubic meters) in size. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"(CNN) -- Facing a stopover of a few hours in Zurich? Don't waste it in the airport lounge. Check in your suitcase, and zip into the city for a brief encounter with a European cultural capital set amidst idyllic natural surroundings. Getting around . Zurich airport, voted the world's seventh best in the recent World Airport Awards, is a mere 10-minute train ride from the city center, with trains leaving about every 10 minutes. You can safely venture into the city without fear of missing your connection -- this being Switzerland, the trains run like clockwork. The Swiss are among the world's biggest users of trains, second only to the Japanese, and insist on rail services that are reliably punctual. Zurich's hyper-efficient Glattalbahn tram network is also invaluable for the time-pressed traveler. The number 10 service runs every seven to 15 minutes and connects Zurich Airport with the city's centrally located main railway station. Situated at the northern tip of Lake Zurich, with a view of the Alps in the distance, Switzerland's largest city has a rich history as a center of European high culture. With a heritage stretching back to Roman times, it is home to grand historic buildings and more than 50 museums, meaning travelers will find plenty to occupy themselves with. See also: Higher air fares, more mergers? None of it comes cheaply though: Zurich recently overtook Tokyo to become the world's most expensive city, according to the Worldwide Cost of Living Survey. To mitigate those expenses, even those on a flying visit will likely find it worthwhile buying a ZurichCARD, which can be bought at the service center at the airport or the railway station. The card, which costs 20 CHF ($21.60) for a 24-hour option, offers free travel on the city's comprehensive public transport network of trains, trams, buses and boats, free admission to museums, and significant discounts on guided tours and other attractions. Given that the return train fare from the airport to the city center is 12.80 CHF ($13.80), and the entry to the Kunsthaus, the city's modern art museum, is 15 CHF ($16.20), even if you only have time for one activity, the card will more than likely pay for itself. City tours . Zurich Tourism advises taking a guided tour of the city, which can be booked through its website. Tours of the postcard scenes of the city's historic Aldstadt, or Old Town, take two hours and run every day, while other tours visit key sites that give an insight into the city's history -- the rise of guilds in the 14th century, or how the city became a stronghold of the Reformation. Another option visits Zurich West, the city's former industrial district between the Limmat River and the railway, which is now a hip, grungy home of designer retailers and eateries. But if you prefer to go at your pace, most of the city's attractions are concentrated in the Old Town, around the river and lakefront, with the rest easily accessed on Zurich's celebrated public transport network, the world's densest. See also: Singapore stopover: Make the most of your travel time . Sights . For a culture fix, head to the Kunsthaus, Switzerland's most significant art collection, representing the important periods of European art from the Middle Ages. Just a few minutes walk away, toward the banks of the Limmat River, is the Grossmunster, a Romanesque-style protestant church that is one of the city's three great churches. Climb the tower for a great view of the city. Five minutes walk across the Limmat is one of the city's other major churches, the Fraumunster, featuring stained glass windows by celebrated Russian artist Marc Chagall. Behind the Fraumunster runs the Bahnhofstrasse, a mile-long shopping street that is one of the world's most exclusive (and expensive). If you have a few hours to spare before your flight, and feel like a bracing trip on the water, the ZurichCARD also allows for free travel on the boats plying Lake Zurich. Boat cruises on 90-minute round trips depart from the Lake Zurich Navigation Company's depot on the waterfront at Burkliplatz, about five minutes walk from the Fraumunster. Fast food . Sightseeing can work up a hunger and some of the city's most distinctive dining experiences are to be had in the Old Town, housed in halls that were formerly home to the guilds that wielded power in the city. But on a tight time frame, it might make more sense to grab something on the go. Follow the crowds to the Sternengrill -- a mobile bratwurst vendor that is a city institution. Other Swiss specialties include soft, baguette-like pretzels loaded with savory fillings -- available city-wide from pretzel chain BrezelkÃ¶nig -- and fresh-cooked crepes smeared in apple sauce, which you can pick up from countless roadside vendors. Sated on street snacks and sightseeing, head back to the train station and make the short ride back to the airport content in the knowledge you've done something more stimulating during your stopover than check your email.","Zurich airport's proximity to the city and good rail link make a city visit essential on a stopover .

"(CNN) -- As a jockey he spent his career guiding horses over the world's toughest fences. But this -- standing in a ditch in a Guatemalan town with a young boy in a ragged rodeo outfit holding the reins of his blind pony -- is an altogether different assignment for Richard Dunwooody. The boy is the son of the local rag-and-bone man, who collects unwanted items and sells them to merchants. Dunwoody is there to take pictures for The Brooke, a UK-based animal charity, in his new career as a photographer. It's in stark contrast to 27 years ago when he burst onto the horse-racing scene aged 22, riding West Tip to victory in Britain's Grand National, a grueling jumps test widely regarded as the hardest and most spectacular event of its kind. Dunwoody, who turned 50 in January, may have stepped out of the saddle some years ago but horse racing still drives his passion and thinking in this relatively new-found career. He was advised by his doctor to give up the racetrack because of the dangers to his already damaged neck should he fall heavily again. ""It's a bit like a quote from my friend Tony McCoy (the 18-time champion jockey with over 4,000 wins to his name) who likes to say whatever you do, if you're riding a winner, remember you might not ride another one,"" Dunwoody told CNN. ""It's the same with photographs. You take a good image and then it's on to the next one. ""I think that horse-racing mentality I had while riding translates well to acting as a driving factor in photography."" The career path from saddle to camera lens is not a well-traveled route, but photography has always been a passion for Dunwoody. ""At school, I was always in the dark room and doing stuff like that,"" he recalls of his youth in Northern Ireland. ""Then during my career I had a lot of friends who were racecourse photographers and sports photographers, so I got more interested then."" After retiring he started heading up riding holidays for travel company Wild Frontiers, which took him on trips around the globe for five or six years. He featured in ""Strictly Come Dancing"" -- the British TV show that spawned ""Dancing with the Stars"" globally -- walked 1,000 miles in 1,000 hours for charity, and retraced the steps of explorer Ernest Shackleton as part of a 48-hour trek to reach the South Pole. ""After all that, I felt I wanted to get about more but wondered what would enable me to do that,"" he adds. ""I thought taking photographs might be a good way of combining the two."" So, he signed up to a nine-month course at the Speos Photographic Institute in Paris specializing in photojournalism, which he says ""really taught me a hell of a lot."" Asked if he has always had a natural eye, he says laughing, ""I wouldn't say that!"" But he has produced a gallery's worth of eye-catching photographs from his various trips, not least of all his first exhibition in January for The Brooke. The charity wanted to highlight its work and the plight of suffering animals by sending Dunwoody to some of the 10 countries where it has projects. ""I was quite surprised how well it was received,"" he says of the exhibition. ""You don't really know how you are, you can never gauge yourself, it's how the images are received by other people. I'm just stumbling around trying to make a living from this."" One memorable trip was to Afghanistan in October, which Dunwoody made independently from the charity. ""I always felt safe there, but you never know,"" he says. ""There was a restaurant we frequented a fair bit while we were there which was blown up by a suicide bomber last month. It makes you think, doesn't it? It's very sad what's happening there but I loved it as a country -- it's a fantastic place really."" Other assignments have included covering the Mongol Derby -- an energy-sapping 1,000-kilometer horse race -- trips to the brick kilns in Cairo to watch children work, slate mines in India and a visit to Antigua, a city perched in the highlands of Guatemala. There are further photographic trips planned, notably one to Japan later this year, and he hankers for a return to the Arctic and Antarctic. ""I went there before I'd done my course but it's just the most beautiful place to take photographs,"" he says. ""We came across a polar bear which I caught on my tiny ready-to-shoot camera, and the pics were OK. I'd like to go back with proper equipment."" Dunwoody, whose time is split between London and living with his girlfriend near Ronda in Spain, still can't believe he has gradually forged a second career for himself from his passion. As for his former colleagues, he has no idea what they make of his photographs -- ""when I see them we never really talk about that"" -- and he is too modest to rate his own photographs. ""I'm happy with one or two of my photographs but it's not up to me to say, that's for other people,"" says Dunwoody, who concedes he is best at action shots. ""I'm just very grateful for this chance and the places it takes me."" So what makes a good photo? ""I've had a few lectures on this subject from some top photographers,"" he says. ""It has to be a good moment, a defining moment, something that makes you look twice, as there are so many images out there now. It's hard to get one of those eye-catching shots. ""In fact, photographs are a lot harder work than they are given credit for, certainly than I used to give credit for. I have an immense amount of respect for photographers."" But he is certainly happy in his new life, which has taken him from in front of the lens to behind it. ""I prefer taking photos of horses than being on them,"" he says. ""Certainly at the Mongol Derby, where the ponies rear up and it's all a bit crazy. This is more sane.""","Ex-jockey Richard Dunwoody swaps saddle for photographic snapshots around the world .

"(CNN) -- Emergency rooms around the United States are preparing for the people who may have Ebola and for the people who just think they have Ebola. ""I have seen several people who had acute illnesses worried that they may have Ebola,"" said Dr. Mark Reiter. He works as an emergency room doctor in Tennessee. He's also president of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine. Reiter says these patients are unlikely candidates, not having been to West Africa, nor having had any contact with a symptomatic Ebola patient. ""But it has gotten a tremendous amount of media coverage and some people are especially concerned about it, even if it is highly unlikely,"" Reiter said. Emergency rooms typically see a small uptick in traffic after a disease has been in the news a lot. A 2010 study that looked at emergency room traffic when swine flu was in the news saw a 7% increase in emergency room visits. Parents must also have been worried about their children catching it as pediatric visits increased 19.7%. A recent Pew study showed 21% of respondents are somewhat worried about Ebola and their personal health. Dr. Abdul Memon, the chief medical officer for disaster and emergency preparedness at Jackson Health System in Miami, said officials have not seen a significant patient increase with the Ebola scare. They do, however, get cases from time to time where people think they may have it. The hospital is careful, he said to rule it out. ""Our health department and the media does a really reasonable job of educating the community about how people get it,"" Memon said. ""I think people are listening and we have not seen this rush of people."" ""If someone has had contact with someone who has Ebola symptoms or they have been in one of these countries, we want them to come in if they feel sick, and we are ready for it. We will pay close attention"" Memon said. The number of deaths attributed to the current Ebola outbreak has topped 4,000, the World Health Organization reported Friday. The latest count brings the total number of confirmed, probable, or suspected cases to 8,399 and the total deaths to 4,033. The numbers were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States. Complete coverage on Ebola . But along with news of the rising death toll, some suspected Ebola cases around the world -- as fears spread across four continents -- have turned out to be false. Concerns about protective measures, especially for those caring for the infected, remain high. A total of 416 health care workers are among those believed to have contracted Ebola. Of those, 233 of have died, the WHO says. 'We just don't really know' An American aid worker who contracted Ebola in Liberia and overcame the virus was said to have become infected while treating Ebola patients there, but she told CNN on Friday that there is no way to be sure. Nancy Writebol was working with Samaritan's Purse in Liberia, caring for Ebola patients, when she became ill and was eventually transferred to an Atlanta hospital, where she recovered. The belief has been that she contracted Ebola while working in a clinic with infected patients, but the survivor said that isn't necessarily the point of infection. ""Well, it's very possible that I contracted Ebola outside of the (medical) unit, not within,"" Writebol said. ""Of course, I came in contact with people outside of our hospital, and I remember knowing and being with a gentleman one time that later died of Ebola. And it's possible that there was, you know, some contact there. We just don't really know."" Writebol was released from Emory University Hospital on August 19, once doctors determined she posed ""no public health threat."" Her recovery has been gradual, Writebol said, but she is gaining strength each day. How the Ebola virus spreads . The lack of clarity about where she became infected is significant as questions are raised worldwide about safety precautions at hospitals and communities as the outbreak stokes fears. The sole person to be diagnosed with the virus on American soil, Thomas Eric Duncan, died this week, as new details of his hospitalization were revealed. He had traveled from Liberia last month. Duncan first went to the hospital on September 25, but the hospital said he only had a ""low grade fever and abdominal pain,"" and was released with some antibiotics and a pain reliever. On Friday, Duncan's nephew Josephus Weeks told CNN that Duncan in fact had a 103-degree fever when he left the hospital, according to the discharge papers. Talking to CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday night, Weeks alleged that the fact Duncan was black, poor and didn't have insurance affected his care. ""Had that been another or another color, he probably would be living today, he would have survived it,"" Weeks said. ""And that's what's hurting me the most: ... They treated him the way they did because of the color of his skin... You stand a chance if you're white, but you don't if you're back."" While it hasn't responded to these latest allegations, Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital did issue a statement Thursday explaining and defending its treatment of Duncan. Why wasn't he immediately given an experimental drug? Because one wasn't available, the hospital explained. Why didn't he get a blood transfusion, like other Ebola patients in the United States? Because ""his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors."" And as to whether Duncan got inferior treatment because of his nationality or wealth, Texas Health Presbyterian said more than 50 people cared for him and a 24-bed intensive care unit was devoted to his care. ""Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and are that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care,"" the hospital said. ""... We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area."" Suspected case comes back negative . On Thursday, a test to see whether a Dallas sheriff's deputy had Ebola came back negative, state health officials said. Word of the test result was welcome news a day after the death of Duncan. The deputy had reported being inside the Dallas apartment where Duncan had been staying and having ""some contact"" with Duncan's family members, Frisco Fire Chief Mark Piland told reporters. Ebola spreads through infected bodily fluids. The deputy, Michael Monnig, on Friday spoke about awaking after having been on duty at Duncan's apartment ""feeling like a truck had hit me."" He identified them as flu-like symptoms, but following the guidance of the county doctor, he went to the clinic, and explained that he had been in the apartment. ""At that point, I knew all the bells and whistles would start up, but at that point, it was out of my control because I had answered yes to the question,"" he said. He broke down crying when he learned he didn't have Ebola, Monnig said. CDC director on Ebola: 'Only thing like this has been AIDS' Spain creates a committee . In Spain, where a nurse's assistant was confirmed to have Ebola, authorities are taking measures to tackle the crisis. The Spanish government will create a special committee to examine the issue, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters in Madrid. The committee, which will include representatives from government and health care, will coordinate national efforts to control the virus and establish protocols to deal with it, she said. The nurse's assistant, Teresa Romero, is the first person to contract Ebola outside of West Africa. A nurses' union spokesman told CNN that ""some nurses and other workers from the Carlos III Hospital (where Romero is being treated) are taking leave for psychological reasons."" To cover those jobs, the Spanish health service is ""making short term contracts hiring nurses that might be unemployed."" Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy visited Carlos III Hospital. ""The situation isn't a normal situation,"" he said. ""It is difficult, but I'm absolutely convinced that everything necessary will be done, especially from the professionals, to overcome this in the future."" CNN's Al Goodman, Elwyn Lopez, Jason Hanna, Catherine E. Shoichet, Greg Botelho and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: Nephew: Hospital gave Duncan inferior treatment because he was black .

"(CNN) -- Clothes can look good, feel good and smell good, but now they can also sound good. Conceptual artist and sound designer Alyce Santoro has developed a material she calls ""sonic fabric."" Made from 50% polyester thread and 50% cassette tape, it has the consistency of denim, but is able to play audio. This month, Santoro has launched a new line of sonic ties -- hand-sewn in Manhattan by designer Julio Cesar. The ties can be played by customizing an old Sony Walkman, and rubbing it across the surface of the fabric. The sound the ties make is, according to Santoro, ""like scratching five records backwards at once."" Sonic fabric began life as an artwork but is now being used in bags, dresses, accessories and more. The spools of cassette tape used in the construction of sonic fabric maintain their magnetism, and can produce sound if amplified by the head of a tape player. Santoro's early versions of the textile interwove tapes from some of her favorite artists including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Richie Havens, as well as real-world sounds such as recordings of the ocean, wind and birdsong. The idea for sonic fabric was actually born long ago; as a child, Santoro raced sailboats using strands of cassette tape as 'tell-tales' to indicate the direction of the wind. ""As a kid I used to imagine that I could hear the sounds that had been recorded onto the tape wafting out into the air if the wind hit them just right -- maybe Beethoven, the Beatles, or Bob Dylan -- whatever tapes my family happened to have around the house,"" Santoro says. Years later, inspired by this childhood vision, Santoro began to develop her sonic fabric, knitting together strands of tape into square prototypes, which she followed up with meter-long textile sheets woven with a loom. In the early days of its development, the fabric's audio capabilities were purely hypothetical, but in 2002 Santoro worked with a friend to customize a Sony Walkman to be able to play the fabric. Hearing it for the first time was, Santoro says, ""magical."" Sonic fabric soon attracted attention from audiophiles who were interested in experimenting with the way music might be hidden in a garment. In 2003, percussionist Jon Fishman commissioned Santoro to make him an outfit which he played live on stage with his band Phish. For the project Fishman lent Santoro his entire tape collection, which she mined for tracks from Prince, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and more. Santoro wove the samples into a ""musical suit"" which drew huge cheers when it was played at Phish's concert in Las Vegas. In the future, Santoro hopes to collaborate with artists and performers to see sonic fabric to further explore the intersection between fashion and music. ""It would be thrilling to work with other sound artists and musicians around the world,"" says Santoro, ""to literally weave together our sonic experiences during these times of powerful transformation in the realms of society, politics, and the environment. The resulting fabric could be shared and made into anything imaginable by anyone interested."" CNN caught up with Santoro for a Q&A. CNN: Where did you get the idea for sonic fabric? And how has its use changed in the time you have been working with it? AS: I got the idea to weave with cassette tape when I saw Tibetan Buddhist prayer flags for the first time many years ago. It was explained to me at the time that the flags often have images of sacred sounds, or ""mantras,"" block-printed onto them. Colorful strings of these flags are hung in auspicious locations where the wind can ""activate"" the sounds, sending ""good vibes"" out around the world on the breeze. This immediately reminded me of experiences I'd had racing small sailboats as a kid. When sailing, it's imperative to remain aware of subtle variations in the direction and speed of the wind at all times. There are very low-tech ways to determine this, including feeling the wind on your face, and keeping an eye on ""tell-tales"" -- small strands of yarn that are tied to the rigging. It so happens that cassette tape is commonly used for this purpose, as it is a very sensitive, durable material. As a kid I used to imagine that I could hear the sounds that had been recorded onto the tape wafting out into the air if the wind hit them just right -- maybe Beethoven, the Beatles, or Bob Dylan -- whatever tapes my family happened to have around the house. I thought it would be interesting to combine the idea of the Tibetan flags with the tell-tails; to weave a fabric quite literally imbued with sonic potential. CNN: Where and how is it made? AS: Sonic Fabric is woven at a small, family-run textile mill in New England on an astoundingly beautiful 1940s Dobby loom that was salvaged by the mill especially for this purpose -- it has a special shuttle that just happens to handle cassette tape perfectly. CNN: What projects is sonic fabric currently being used in? Where would you like to see it used in future? AS: At the moment, sonic fabric is mostly used in installation art in the form of sets of sailboat sails. I like to imagine that the energy stored in the carefully-blended sounds can have some positive effect, however subtle, on the surrounding environment. I am currently collaborating with a designer friend on a line of small, wearable accessories. Julio Cesar hand sews neckties, small bags, and other custom pieces for anyone who would like to have a functional work of conceptual art that can be used as part of ""everyday life"". In the future, I envision more collaborative opportunities -- it would be thrilling to work with other sound artists and musicians around the world to literally weave together our sonic experiences during these times of powerful transformation in the realms of society, politics, and the environment. The resulting fabric could be shared and made into anything imaginable by anyone interested. CNN: How does it sound? AS: The sound that the fabric emits is garbled, like scratching five records backwards at once. Since the 1/8"" wide strands of cassette tape get folded when they go into the loom, there are probably 20 or so strands squished into an inch of fabric. An average-width tape head is capable of picking up maybe 5 or 6 strands of tape at a time. The sound the OM tone edition of fabric emits is not garbled. However, since it's recorded with only a single note, it makes a single clear tone that can be adjusted according to the speed at which the player is rubbed along the fabric. CNN: Can anyone play it? AS: Absolutely! All you need is an old Walkman and some headphones or a small amplifier. Here's how to build one, with examples of what it sounds like when the fabric is ""played.""","Sonic fabric is a textile made from cassette tape and polyester thread .
The material has the consistency of denim but is capable of producing audio .
Sonic fabric has been used in collections by fashion designers and live on stage by musicians ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry is cutting short an economic development trip through Europe to return home as officials in his state work to stop the spread of Ebola. He'd originally been scheduled to return Sunday, but Perry spokesman Felix Browne told CNN the three-term Republican governor will now fly back on Thursday. His decision to cut short an economic development-focused trip through England, Germany, Poland and Ukraine comes after President Barack Obama called off plans for a fundraising trip to New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday when a second Dallas health care worker was diagnosed with Ebola. Perry had defended his decision to leave this week for Europe, saying in a statement Wednesday that he's been in close contact with state and federal officials about the Ebola response. He said he had spoken with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell ""to ensure state and federal management of this issue is tightly coordinated."" He also said he speaks daily with Dr. Brett Giroir, who heads an infectious disease task force that Perry formed earlier this month, and Dr. David Lakey, the commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. Those two are helming the state's efforts. ""This is the first time that our nation has had to deal with a threat such as this. Everyone working on this challenge -- from the medical professionals at the bedside to the public health officials addressing containment of the infection -- is working to end the threat posed by this disease,"" Perry said. ""These individuals are keeping the health and safety of Texans and the needs of the patients as their most critical tasks,"" he said. ""Every relevant agency at the local, state and national levels is working to support these individuals."" His trip -- just months from the end of Perry's 12-year tenure in the governor's office -- drew criticism from Texas Democrats who called his absence while Dallas health care workers are treated for Ebola poor leadership. It also put Perry at risk of missing an opportunity to demonstrate his executive capabilities ahead of a widely-expected 2016 campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. ""I have great faith that we will succeed in this important mission; once we have put it behind us we will be the stronger for it and more prepared to meet the kinds of challenges that we as Americans are uniquely prepared to face,"" Perry said.","Texas Gov. Rick Perry is returning Thursday from a European trade mission.

"(CNN) -- ""I am Chelsea Manning."" With those words, read from a statement on NBC's ""Today"" show on Thursday, Bradley Manning immediately shifted public conversation away from the Army private's conviction on espionage charges to gender identity. ""As I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know the real me,"" Manning said in the statement. ""I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in this transition."" While his supporters may back Manning, the Army said Thursday it won't. 5 things to know about gender identity . One Army official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about Manning's case, said the private remains a male in the eyes of the Army. Another said Manning would be treated like any other prisoner. ""A lot of the inmates have issues they're dealing with,"" said the second official, who also was not authorized to speak publicly about Manning's case. ""Even if you have gender identity disorder, you still serve your sentence."" That includes access -- like any other inmate -- to mental health professionals like psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and behavioral expects, said Kimberly Lewis, a spokeswoman at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where Manning will be held. She added those diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the medical term for those who identify with another gender, ""must still complete their sentence"" without hormone therapy or sex-reassignment surgery provided by the Army. The Human Rights Campaign, though, insisted Thursday that the military should grant Manning's wishes. Celebrities react to Manning's statement . ""The care she receives should be something that she and her doctors -- including professionals who understand transgender care -- agree is best for her,"" the campaign said, using the pronoun Manning asked to be identified by. ""There is a clear legal consensus that it is the government's responsibility to provide medically necessary care for transgender people and the military has an obligation to follow those guidelines."" Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, told ""Today"" that he'll take action if the Army doesn't provide the hormone therapy Manning has requested. ""I'm hoping Fort Leavenworth would do the right thing and provide that,"" Coombs said. ""If Fort Leavenworth does not, then I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that they are forced to do so."" Pfc. Manning was sentenced on Wednesday to 35 years in prison for leaking 750,000 pages of classified documents to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. A military judge convicted Manning in July, sparing the former intelligence analyst from the most serious charge of aiding the enemy. Gender identity issues . The issue of Manning's gender identity repeatedly surfaced during the court-martial. A widely circulated picture released by the military showed Manning wearing a blond wig. The image came from an e-mail Manning sent to a superior titled ""My Problem."" ""It's not going away, it's haunting me more and more as I get older,"" Manning wrote in the e-mail. ""Now, the consequences of it are dire, at a time when it's causing me great pain in itself. As a result, I'm not sure what to do about it."" An Army psychologist called by the defense said Manning appeared to be isolated and under intense pressure as a male soldier struggling with gender identity issues. Speaking during the sentencing phase of the court-martial last week, Manning said the decision to leak the documents came while ""dealing with a lot of issues"" -- a reference to the gender identity crisis. Transgender in a male-or-female world . Reaction . Manning's announcement brought a range of reaction. On Twitter, where ""Chelsea Manning"" was a hot topic of discussion, user onekade wrote of being ""pretty much in awe of Chelsea Manning's bravery, on so many fronts."" Others were less supportive. ""Chelsea Manning,"" conservative pundit John Podhoretz tweeted. ""This country has officially jumped the shark."" Coombs told ""Today"" that Manning did not intend to make a public issue of his desire to live as a woman. ""She never really wanted this to be public to begin with,"" Coombs said. ""When the information came out, you need to understand that she gave it to Adrian Lamo in a very private setting, in a one-on-one chat, never expecting this to be public. Now that it is, unfortunately, you have to deal with it in a public manner."" Lamo is a former hacker from California who pleaded guilty in 2004 to breaking into The New York Times secure computer network. In 2010, Lamo, in California, and Manning, in Iraq, chatted over a few days, Lamo has said. Manning's lawyer: He should not 'rot in jail' Legal issues . The issue of taxpayers being required to pay for gender reassignment surgery has come up repeatedly in recent court cases. Earlier this year, a federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit brought by a transgender prisoner in Virginia, where a prison had refused to allow her to undergo sex reassignment surgery. Last year, a federal judge ordered Massachusetts to pay for a sex change operation for a convicted murderer. The state is appealing that decision. There are few good statistics on the number of transgender inmates in U.S. prisons, according to Vincent Villano of the National Center for Transgender Equality. A study of California prisons identified 330 transgender inmates in an overall prison population of 160,000, he said. The center believes those numbers are higher, he said. At Fort Leavenworth, Manning can't alter his clothing to reflect a desire to be seen as a woman. Lewis noted that Army regulations require all prisoners wear a ""distinctive ... uniform (with) a white name tag with black letters spelling the last name of the prisoner over the right picket of the shirt."" The letters won't change for Manning. But, as Lewis said, Manning could otherwise go through the courts to legally change his first name -- to Chelsea. CNN's Chris Lawrence and Dan Merica contributed to this report.","NEW: Manning will have access to mental health experts like other inmates, official says .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Smartphones can control drones, speeding robots, cameras and the temperature of your master bathroom. That's just some of the technology on display in Las Vegas this week at the annual International Consumer Electronics Show. The massive show doesn't kick off in earnest until Tuesday, but some companies gave a sneak preview of their gadgets at the CES Unveiled event Sunday night. The technology at Unveiled tends to skew small and fun, and many products are from start-ups instead of major companies. A few are already available but most are scheduled to come out a bit later this year. Among the usual headphones and speakers, we found some interesting gizmos. Some might go mainstream, others will be copied by major companies, and some are just too strange or niche to make it outside of a select group of tech enthusiasts. Racing robots . Smartphone-controlled toys are popular, especially the rugged rolling robots that show off by jumping, spinning and speeding around. Sphero follows up its smartphone-controlled ball with the programmable Sphero 2B, an infrared-equipped two-wheeled robot that can go up to 14 feet per second and leap 3 to 4 feet into the air. The company behind the device, Orbotix, thinks people will use it in a variety of multiplayer smartphone games or for racing. Also on display was the similar Jumping Sumo from Parrot. The Sumo can also go high into the air and speed and do tricks, and it includes a built-in camera. Recreational drones . Tiny, medium and large drones are constantly buzzing through the CES airspace. Some, like the Parrot MiniDrone, are just toys, meant to be controlled with smartphones and used to amaze or annoy your friends. The medium-size drones can be fun and also serve a purpose. DJI Innovations makes a line of professional and consumer drones for shooting video and taking photos. Its newest product is the Phantom II Vision, which has a built-in camera instead of the usual camera mount. You can see what the camera is seeing from a smartphone app while the drone is in the air. It also shares stats like telemetry data and warns you if the drone is too close to the 400-foot maximum height allowed by law. The company also makes a version of the Phantom II without a camera, so you can mount something like your own GoPro, and a hulking professional version that can carry a professional-size camera, like the Canon 5D. New kind of keyboard . Some of the best gadgets at CES are the weirdest. The Mobile QWERTY keyboard from TrewGrip takes the traditional computer keyboard, splits it, flips it and puts it on the back of a hand-held keyboard, where you will press them without looking. The device is meant to be ergonomic and a full-size alternative to the tiny on-screen keyboards found on most mobile devices. The company says that it's easy to learn the new style of typing since the order of the letters is the same, and the front of the keyboard offers a light-up guide to help with the transition. The keyboard connects to mobile devices over Bluetooth, but it can also be attached to the center of the keyboard with a suction mount. Wearable sensors with flair . Using tiny sensors to track activity in watches, bracelets and other wearable doodads has been getting more mainstream. The next step is to make them something people actually want to be seen wearing. The early attempts are focusing on disguising the tech as familiar accessories. June is a UV sensor inside what looks like a sparkly piece of costume jewelry. The $99 fake gem attaches to a double-wrap leather bracelet or can be pinned to clothing. It tracks sun exposure, sunblock usage and other details and then churns out advice to keep the wearer from soaking in too many rays or burning. Wellograph attempts to make the usually sporty fitness tracker into a high-end-looking watch. Also on a leather strap, the large square watch face is made out of hardy sapphire crystal and shows all the information in simple white lettering on black. It tracks heart rate, steps and fitness levels. It can sync to a smartphone but can also hold up to four months of data. The $320 watch will be available in April. Power providers . Having enough power is an issue in developing countries, in emergencies and for anyone who needs to use a smartphone for more than half a day without recharging. A group of power-related gadgets attempts to address all the power problems on the spectrum. Intelligent Energy is working with Brookstone on a hydrogen-powered fuel cell that will cost $199 when it launches in the U.S. this spring. The device is able to charge a smartphone five times on a single cartridge, but the cartridges are swapped out at Brookstone locations. It's not exactly off-the-grid living if you're driving to the nearest strip mall to get a refill, but the device is also rolling out in South Africa and Nigeria through cell carriers, which could have many more refill locations. The Waka Waka chargers are solar powered and already used by 102,000 people in Syria. The device got its start as a Kickstarter project, and now the makers are hoping that sales in the U.S. and Europe can help make the same devices more affordable in developing countries and areas hit by disasters. There's also a Waka Waka solar-powered light, and the company is working on a full emergency kit for the future. Trackers, trackers everywhere . Tiny tracking devices are the hot, cheap product du jour. In addition to the fitness trackers, there are sensors for keeping track of your belongings, tracking your sleep patterns, and tracking air quality and temperature. One of the odder offerings we saw was Mother, a hub that looks like a happy ghost and works with up to 24 tiny sensors called cookies. The sensors can be placed on anything (or anyone) in the home and used to track their location, status or temperature. Like many of the systems at CES, Mother doesn't play well with other systems and devices. Withings wants to track sleep with a sensor that slips under a mattress and a companion smart lamp and alarm, called the Aura, that tracks what part of the sleep cycle a person is in. When it's time to get up, the Aura waits until the right part of the sleep cycle. While users are asleep, it generates special colored lights that the company says helps people generate melatonin. The device, which comes out in the spring, can also sense light levels and air quality.","New technology is previewed ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .

"(CNN) -- More than 20 million people watched the Golden Globes on Sunday night, the highest total audience for the awards show in 10 years. The strong ratings for the Globes were another affirmation that live awards shows are a boon to television networks in this age of increasingly time-shifted viewing. According to Nielsen, the average total audience during the three-hour broadcast was 20.9 million, up from 19.7 million last year. The network that televised the awards, NBC, pulled a 6.5 rating in the key advertiser demographic of adults ages 18 to 49, an uptick from last year's 6.4 rating. NBC said the total viewer number was the Globes' best since 2004, when the program drew 26.8 million viewers. On the Internet, Nielsen SocialGuide, which measures the reach of Twitter messages, found that 2.36 million messages about the Globes reached a total of 10.4 million users on Sunday night. Entertainment Weekly, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner, observed that ""any ratings boost could be seen as another endorsement of hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who hosted the show for the second year in a row. They are also signed to host the awards next year."" The red carpet arrivals special on NBC, hosted by the cast of the ""Today"" show, also performed well. It averaged more than 10 million viewers between 7 and 8 p.m. ET. The competing red carpet special on E! averaged 2.2 million viewers between 6 and 8 p.m. ET, which E! said was one of its highest-rated editions in Globes history.

"(CNN) -- California, in an honest attempt to clarify communication about sexual consent in colleges and universities, has created just another way we can misunderstand each other. Let me be clear: I support efforts to make rape or date rape or sexual opportunism when someone is drunk less likely. Who wouldn't? The law requires state colleges and universities to require ""affirmative consent"" from everyone engaged in sexual activity. Consent ""must be ongoing throughout."" The law specifies that silence and lack of protest makes consent impossible, and drunkenness is not an excuse. But this step-by-step consent plan is just not the way hot and heavy sex generally proceeds on college campuses. And it falls apart when you consider that a lot of sex on campus happens when people are drunk. That's the real problem. Except for truly malignant or misguided offenders -- ""she asked for it"" kind of guys -- most sexual calamities happen when students are drinking. In a study by American Sociological Association President Paula England, students reported a mean of six drinks for men and four drinks for women on their last ""'hook up."" That's just the tip of the iceberg, and that's what we should be addressing: the over-drinking and under socialization about what makes sex worthwhile and why unconscious sex is not in anyone's best interests. But instead of dealing with the real problem, legislators are going to have a standard of conduct that most dating couples or people who meet at a party will not follow. This won't be a problem -- until someone believes he or she did not give a specific permission. If it sounds like an easy thing to do, remember how you were in your late teens and 20s and you might recall that being articulate during sex is not so easy. Legislating sex on campus . Will people really ask permission as they make the transition from oral sex to intercourse if their partner seems to be enthusiastically joining in? Unlikely. And if both partners are drunk, is one more culpable than the other? I applaud the idea that both partners should be conscious, but do you think young men who throw a fraternity party think nobody will drink too much? And do the young women who go to these parties expect to stay sober? If we want to make rules about something, we should try to make rules about these parties. That might work. And we should try to educate young people about how easy it is to ruin their lives when they are drunk. But who are we going to punish if it's a one-on-one encounter, both parties are drunk -- or not -- and each has different ideas of what was said? As the professor of many university students and the mother of a girl and a boy who thankfully made it out of their 20s with no sexual and emotional scars, I worried about both my students and my kids in these years: I feared my daughter might get in a tough situation with a sexually aggressive date or that my son might be wrongfully accused by someone he didn't want to date any longer, or by a partner who changed her mind about what happened after a big night of partying. My fears were not baseless: I heard many examples of these kinds of situations. Still, in our effort to protect the sexual victimization of women, we create a standard that is probably impossible to produce all the time. I am not convinced that young women cannot be given the tools to say no, and men cannot learn how to accept that answer. I think most young men want to be wanted and proceed when they think they are. Yes, there are rapists who think they are wanted and that it's just incidental that they have a knife in their hand when she consents. But these are the criminal and pathological minds that not only won't follow this regime, they won't even think it applies to them. Other measures of avoidance and protection are necessary to save women from sociopaths. It's laughable to think this kind of predator would even notice, much less follow, these rules. So who are they for? The guys who might misunderstand what a woman wants and find themselves mystified when charges are brought against them? Will these rules protect them? Probably not, because I think those guys will believe that their partner's behavior says it all. What would you do if you kissed someone passionately and he or she responded in kind? Would you ask permission before you began to use your tongue? I'm not saying no one can do this. I think many smart and caring men and women do ask permission along the way and are careful and sensitive observers of what their partner wants and says. I'm all for encouraging that kind of protection of oneself and one's partner. But I think most of this would be clear and careful if it weren't happening in an alcoholic fog, and that's where I'd put my money and educational efforts.","California requires colleges to require participants' ""affirmative consent"" during sex .

"(CNN) -- At 23, many people around the world are still at university -- at that age, Gossy Ukanwoke had already started one. The young entrepreneur is the founder of Beni American University (BAU), Nigeria's first private online university. Launched in late 2012, the school allows students to access their classes at any time of the day with any internet-enabled device. ""We are providing executive programs for graduates who are looking for employment and want to build up their resumes, or managers who want to climb up the hierarchy of their companies,"" says Ukanwoke, now 25. ""We also have courses targeted at people who want to start their own business."" 'Nigeria's Mark Zuckerberg' Ukanwoke's idea to start BAU came from his previous online venture called Students Circle, an educational social networking site he'd launched while in university that allows learners to interact and access free resources from leading schools. ""When I created Students Circle in 2010,"" explains Ukanwoke, ""I found out that ... many were looking for certificates, hoping that they could get something they could use to maybe find employment or get a promotion in the workplace. ""There was a need for a new institution to be created in Nigeria,"" adds Ukanwoke, who was once described by Forbes as ""Nigeria's Mark Zuckerberg."" Now, some 18 months into his new business endeavor, Ukanwoke has hired 10 instructors and has about 200 students, with an average age of 26. But the startup's journey so far has not been without challenges -- Nigerian laws require universities to have a physical campus so last year Ukanwoke went and bought land in the country's Benue State with the goal to build a private campus that could accommodate some 10,000 students. The project is expected to launch next year, but in the meantime the web courses are up and running -- a 12 week online program can cost between $100 and $300. Among the courses offered are corporate diplomacy, global marketing, leadership and management, digital journalism, project management and entrepreneurship and innovation, which is the university's most popular class. ""It's good because I have four kids,"" says Chinenye Madukwe, one of BAU's students. ""I have opportunity to work at the same time, because I have a small interior design outfit."" Oo Nwoye, another BAU student, says he enrolled ""for the knowledge."" ""It is just helpful for my business and that is the most important thing to me,"" he explains. Education is key . A son of two teachers, Ukanwoke says he is driven by his passion to use technology to solve social problems. ""I grew up within the framework where education was put at a very high level of importance, and entrepreneurship is something that I always wanted to do,"" he says. ""Without education I don't think we can do any progress,"" he adds. ""It's not just about getting a certificate -- education is about teaching people how to make a living and teaching people how to live; how to interact with others, how to lead their lives and make something out of themselves,"" continues Ukanwoke. ""With education comes discipline and we need a lot of discipline in Nigeria as well, so education is really important."" Ukanwoke relies mainly on social media to advertize but says that it's student referrals that are increasing BAU's enrollment. ""We still have a long way to go, we have a lot of work to do, a lot of policy wrangling too,"" he admits. ""But it's a work in progress and we are quite happy with where we are.""","Gossy Ukanwoke has created Nigeria's first private online university .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison for taking bribes while mayor of Jerusalem. Olmert was also fined 1 million shekels (about $289,000), Israeli state radio IB reported. Olmert was convicted in March of receiving about $161,000 in bribes related to a controversial Jerusalem housing project called Holyland. The judge acquitted Olmert on a third count of bribery. The developer of Holyland, Hillel Cherney, had been previously convicted of bribing Olmert and other high-level officials in exchange for Holyland approvals. Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003. Olmert, an attorney who in 1973 became the youngest person ever elected to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009. He announced his resignation shortly after police recommended corruption charges against him. In August 2012, he was convicted of breach of trust and acquitted on two corruption-related charges after a trial that lasted nearly three years. He was given a 3-month suspended jail sentenced and fined about $19,000 in that case. The allegations stemmed from Olmert's time as mayor as well as prime minister. Prosecutors accused him of double-billing government agencies for travel, taking cash from an American businessman in exchange for official favors and acting on behalf of his former law partner's clients.","A judge says Ehud Olmert took bribes from a developer while he was mayor of Jerusalem .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paul Walker's brothers are helping ""fill in small gaps"" in ""Fast & Furious 7"" action sequences not finished before the actor's death, producers said Tuesday. Walker died in a fiery car crash during a Thanksgiving break in filming last November, forcing a halt to production. ""We had to take time to grieve Paul, the brother we love and lost, and to figure out if we should move on with our film,"" producers wrote to fans in a Facebook post Tuesday. The decision to resume filming was ""the only choice,"" the note said. We believe our fans want that, and we believe Paul would want that, too."" Walker's dramatic scenes were completed before his death but some action sequences were unfinished, they said. ""We have resumed shooting and now welcome Paul's brothers, Caleb and Cody, into our 'Fast' family,"" the post said. ""Caleb and Cody are helping us complete some remaining action for their brother and fill in small gaps left in production. Having them on set has made us all feel that Paul is with us, too."" The movie was to have been released this summer, but Universal pushed it back to April 10, 2015. ""This film is the most important we've ever done together,"" the post said. ""It will allow the character of Brian O'Conner to live on and let us celebrate Paul in his most defining role."" Walker's O'Conner character is a staple of the long-running and hugely profitable film franchise. Directed by James Wan, it also stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and Jason Statham. Walker's death: Video shows car erupted in flames after 60 seconds . Investigators concluded in a report released in March that speed was to blame in Walker's death. ""Investigators determined the cause of the fatal solo-vehicle collision was unsafe speed for the roadway conditions,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Commander Mike Parker said. The high-performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was going ""between 80 and 93 mph at the time the car impacted a power pole and several trees,"" the final report said. The posted speed limit on the Santa Clarita, California, office park road was 45 mph. Walker, 40, and friend Roger Rodas, 38, had no drugs or alcohol in their blood, the report said. Both men were wearing seat belts. The airbags deployed as they should have when the car clipped a light pole and several trees, investigators said. Nothing mechanical went wrong to cause the Porsche to leave the wide road. Investigators found ""no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision,"" the report said. Porsche Carrera GT: 5 reasons the car Paul Walker died in is different . Walker and Rodas, racing team partners, left a charity event at a car shop co-owned by the men to take a ride in an office park in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street. Ice Cube apologizes for offending Paul Walker fans .","""Caleb and Cody are helping us complete some remaining action,"" producers say .

"(CNN) -- Jesse Matthew, a suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, is being held in isolation in a Virginia jail cell, authorities said Saturday. Authorities took Matthew to Charlottesville, Virginia, on Friday after he agreed not to fight extradition from Texas, where he had been taken into custody after police obtained a warrant for his arrest on Tuesday. Investigators think he was the last person with Graham. He is charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case, according to Charlottesville police. He was offered two phone calls, but refused to make them, according to the Albemarle Charlottesville Regional Jail. He's sleeping on a mattress on the floor in a cell so spare that it doesn't even have bathroom facilities, according to a jail official. Graham was last seen September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. Police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old, a second-year student the university. Matthew willingly went to a Virginia police station over the weekend, when there was no warrant for his arrest, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said. He asked for a lawyer. They spoke and then left, police said. Matthew's father said his son is not the type to hurt anyone. ""For a big man, he's as gentle as they come,"" Jesse Matthew Sr. told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""The only thing I could see, him, maybe trying to give the girl a ride or help her out."" ""To kill or hurt somebody, that's not my son."" Found camping on the beach . Authorities found Matthew on a Galveston County beach after deputies got a call about a suspicious person camping there. A license plate check revealed he was wanted, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Matthew did not resist arrest, police said. Mike Rodenberg, a vacationer who was fishing near the campsite when Matthew was arrested, said Matthew asked about why he was throwing some of his catch back. ""He seemed real nice. He was real soft-spoken,"" Rodenberg said. ""(He) said he was down here from New Jersey and was looking for a job. I told him if I caught another red fish he could have it."" Matthew told him that his name was George, Rodenberg said. Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary until the police showed up. Questioned in another case . In addition to Graham's disappearance, Matthew also has been questioned in connection with an alleged sexual assault nearly 12 years ago. According to a statement from Lynchburg police, a woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University on October 17, 2002. Matthew was a student there for three years and played on the football team. However, no charges were filed because the woman didn't want to go forward with the case, and investigators determined there wasn't enough evidence to arrest Matthew back then, said Michael Doucette, the commonwealth's attorney for Lynchburg, Virginia. Matthew told authorities that the woman consented, Doucette said, adding that there were no witnesses. Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know .

"(CNN) -- A few years ago, Brian Daniel was driving around Los Angeles when he spotted a neon sign for a random storage facility. The red stick figures carrying yellow boxes glowed from the mundane building. It was like it was screaming out to him. Daniel loved how a sign could go from ordinary and unremarkable during the day to ""talking to you"" at night. L.A.'s neon won over the frequent traveler, who has concluded the City of Angels has the best neon anywhere. ""They have just enough peppered through the city where it just comes alive,"" said Daniel, a Chicago-based headhunter. ""I was so compelled by it that for two weeks I just drove around and took pictures of neon signs."" What's disappointing for enthusiasts like Daniel is that neon is dying. Businesses are switching to cheaper, more energy-efficient LED bulbs and municipal planning boards are zoning out neon to decrease the number of unsightly displays. ""Neon spent most of its career in this country more hated than loved in terms of being banned and put under zoning ordinances,"" said neon historian Thomas Rinaldi. ""It's an iconic part of the 20th century, but it's been legislated out of existence in some places. There's a vindictive attitude toward it."" Neon lights weren't always losing ground. They were once in LED's shoes, beating out an old mode of lighting. In 1902, just a few years after neon gas was discovered by British chemists, French engineer Georges Claude sent it coursing through electrified glass tubes, creating neon lighting. The new type of light quickly ousted incandescent bulbs, the former favorite of sign-makers. Claude started marketing neon signs in Europe and in the early 1920s came to America, where neon's popularity exploded, said Rinaldi. In the 1930s, neon was everywhere in America. In the beginning of the decade, shops saw the glowing lights as a novelty, though an expensive one, to keep them competitive. They were installed for big corporate chain retailers like car dealers. But by the end of the decade, big businesses had found cheaper alternatives. At that point, neon became associated with less desirable businesses, Rinaldi said. Think seedy hotels and sex shops. Despite the connotation, neon continued to be a ""powerhouse industry"" from the '40s through the '60s, but began a steady decline in the 1970s as even small businesses found cheaper ways to advertise. Some cities came to view the lighting as tacky and overly commercial. Not many people would know now, but Vancouver was covered in neon until it became vilified. People said the signs were garish and distracted from the city's natural beauty. ""They're outsized, outlandish, and outrageous. They're desecrating our buildings, cluttering our streets, and -- this is the final indignity -- blocking our view of some of the greatest scenery in the world,"" Vancouver Sun columnist Tom Ardies wrote in 1966, as quoted in a 2011 Sun article. It wasn't just Vancouver turning off the neon. The Big Apple went from tens of thousands of signs in the '70s to just a few hundred across the five boroughs today, said Rinaldi, author of ""New York Neon."" Across the United States, the use of neon signs saw another sharp dip in the late 2000s, according to a survey by trade magazine Signs of the Times. Signs were illuminated by 33% neon and 23% LEDs in 2007, but the tables had turned by 2010. By then LEDs more than doubled the use of neon, 40% to 18%. In the last few years, even Hong Kong, with its rows of iconic neon-lit streets, has started to turn to LEDs. Despite its commercial decline, neon has still enjoyed periods of popularity as an art form, experts say. ""It's that color, it's that light,"" said Kim Koga, an artist who started working with neon in the late '80s, and is now the director of the Neon Art Museum in Los Angeles. ""It's kind of magical, even though it's a mixture of a chemistry project and magic."" For Houston native and long-time neon fan Randall Brelsford, the lighting is a message from another time. ""I always loved neon because it was a representation of the future from the people of the past,"" he said. ""There's something that's just so romantic about dark and neon. It can be really sleazy or it can be really romantic. It's a really adaptive light."" Preserving neon and making people aware of it has become the mission of the Neon Art Museum, as well as the other big museum in the U.S., the Neon Museum in Las Vegas. The Los Angeles museum started in the '80s, as signs were coming down around the city. Koga knows the museum can't possibly fit all the neon signs it saves, but collectors and enthusiasts have helped take in some of the larger signs. ""Making people aware of its unique history in America and the value of it has turned things around in L.A.,"" she said. ""There are enough examples that have awakened developers to the value of neon signs on their buildings. Now they want to put a neon sign on their buildings to give it that look.""","Neon lights are fading as cities ban signs and switch to cheaper LEDs .

"(CNN) -- Another child in Colorado has been hospitalized with partial paralysis. Doctors don't know what is causing the mysterious neurological illness. They have identified 11 other children at the hospital with similar symptoms: limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in the spinal gray matter. Four children in Boston also match the criteria for this illness, doctors say. The mother of one of the Colorado children described the family's ""scary experience"" at a telebriefing on Friday. It started with a cough. Then the girl became lethargic and her fever rose. Her mom took her to the doctor, but the girl's blood work looked fine. Doctors sent her home to rest. The next day, the girl complained of weakness in her arm. ""I thought that she was being dramatic and faking it,"" her mom said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But over Labor Day weekend, the muscle weakness got worse. ""She kept dropping her corn on the cob."" Almost two weeks after the illness started, the girl was admitted to the hospital. Some of the children in Colorado and Boston have tested positive for enterovirus D68, a virus that has been sending children around the country to the hospital with severe respiratory illness. But others had no signs of the virus in their system. ""It's probably going to be weeks to months in terms of trying to understand what's happening,"" said Dr. Samuel Dominguez with Children's Hospital. As of Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 500 cases of respiratory illnesses caused by enterovirus D68 in 42 states. Enterovirus D68 has also been found in samples from four people who died recently, according to the CDC, but it's unclear what role the virus played in their deaths. It's possible that enterovirus D68 had nothing to do with them. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in the late summer and early fall, with the CDC estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States. ""I tend to be a fairly calm, laid-back mom,"" the girl's mother said when asked about her recommendation for other parents. ""Yes, things are mysterious, and it's hard in life when we can't get an exact answer, but I really feel that it's not something that other people should panic about."" Her daughter has returned to school and continues to do physical therapy to regain strength in her am. Several children are still in the hospital, Dominguez said. ""The other kids who have been admitted have continued to be stable ... they're not getting worse but they're not showing dramatic improvement.""

"(CNN) -- The flag that flew over the U.S. Capitol on September 11, 2001, was destroyed in a fire at the headquarters of the Shanksville, Pennsylvania, memorial to United Airlines Flight 93, the National Park Service said Saturday. The blaze Friday destroyed the headquarters complex of Flight 93 National Memorial, dedicated to the 40 passengers and crew who died when Flight 93 crashed outside the town in southwestern Pennsylvania during the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil. The plane went down, killing all on board, as passengers fought back against the hijackers, according to investigations. Investigators said the terrorists were most likely trying to turn the airplane toward Washington to hit a major political target, such as the Capitol. In a statement, the National Park Service said the items that survived the fire included the majority of 820 oral histories conducted since 2005, the archival photo collection and 480 DVDs containing tens of thousands of images of the crash scene, investigation, temporary memorials and construction of the permanent memorial. ""Unfortunately, the flag that flew over the U.S. Capitol on September 11, 2001, was destroyed,"" the statement said. The flag was donated by former House Speaker Dennis Hastert during last month's 9/11 anniversary ceremony at the crash site. Also lost in the fire were a handful of personal items of passengers and crew recovered from the crash site and from families, copies of DVDs of the annual commemoration ceremonies and meetings of the memorial's federal advisory commission, and about 100 ""tribute items"" to the passengers and crew left by visitors since 2001. NPS spokesman Mike Litterst said the fire was being jointly investigated by the National Park Service and Pennsylvania State Police. The cause has not been determined. Litterst told CNN affiliate WJAC that the buildings had fire alarms but no sprinklers. Some charred documents have blown away from the fire scene and can be found on the grounds, Litterst said. ""We've got museum recovery teams to help us salvage items that may be smoke damaged or fire damages,"" he said. A memorial employee, who is also a member of the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department, suffered minor first-degree burns attempting to extinguish the blaze, which started about 3 p.m. Friday. ""We continue to be grateful that there was no loss of life to visitors or employees, especially given the speed with which the fire engulfed the structures,"" Litterst said in the statement. Ken Nacke, whose brother Louis was on Flight 93, helped raise funds for the Flight 93 National Memorial and advised in its planning. ""It's heartbreaking that we spent all this time to have this happen,"" he said Friday. ""All the blood sweat and tears that went into building this."" Neither the memorial itself nor the new visitor center currently under construction -- both located about two miles from the headquarters -- were affected, Litterst said. The memorial's visitor center will include traditional and interactive exhibits, public programs and information about the history of Flight 93. United Airlines Flight 93 was traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco when hijackers took over the plane, according to the 9/11 Commission. Since 2001, more than 1 million people from around the world have visited the crash site. What you need to know about the Flight 93 National Memorial .

"(CNN) -- The first two doses of an experimental serum created to treat Ebola went to American missionaries. Then the drug was sent to treat a Spanish priest. The two Americans, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, appear to be recovering. The priest, Miguel Pajares, died Tuesday morning. That's the problem with experimental drugs that have never been clinically tested in humans: No one knows whether they'll work -- and if they do, in whom. This week, the World Health Organization gathered a group of ethicists to decide whether unproven medications and vaccines should be used in the current Ebola outbreak. As the death toll from the epidemic soared over 1,000, the WHO panel unanimously concluded that it is ethical to offer medications to fight the Ebola virus, even if their effectiveness or adverse effects are unknown. ""The large number of people affected by the 2014 west Africa outbreak, and the high case-fatality rate, have prompted calls to use investigational medical interventions to try to save the lives of patients and to curb the epidemic,"" the World Health Organization said Tuesday. WHO says it believes the virus has infected 1,848 people and killed 1,013, making this the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. The difference between this outbreak and other Ebola outbreaks is that traditional methods of stopping the virus from spreading -- protective gear, contact tracing, etc. -- don't seem to be working fast enough, said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's assistant director-general. The health care systems in the affected countries are also weak, so resources are scarce. ""If these treatments can save lives ... should we not use them to save lives?"" Kieny said the panel asked. After the panel's decision, Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose announced Tuesday her government will donate between 800 and 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to WHO. A ""small supply"" will be kept at home ""in the unlikely event it is needed for compassionate use in Canada,"" the Public Health Agency said in a news release. The drug -- called VSV-EBOV -- is Canadian-made and owned, having been developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory. It's never been tested on humans, ""but has shown promise in animal research,"" the agency states. A Canadian government ethics advisory group and the WHO panel of medical ethics experts both ""informed"" the decision to give out VSV-EBOV, despite its ""unknown efficacy and adverse effects."" Will it work is just one of the key questions surrounding VSV-EBOV. As with ZMapp, other questions include how and on whom it should be used. A vicious killer . Ebola can torment its victims with high fevers, internal and external bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea. It often afflicts multiple organ systems and can kill up to 90% of those infected. The virus spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva and urine. Since the current Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea in March, the disease has spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. And the impact has spread around the world. Cynthia Sangbai-Kwennah, a native of Liberia living in Minnesota, has lost nine family members to Ebola in less than two months. ""Every time you pick up the phone and you receive a call ... this family is dead, this person is dead,"" Sangbai-Kwennah told CNN affiliate WCCO. First her father perished. Then other relatives who had been taking care of him. Sangbai-Kwennah even lost her younger sister, who had just recently graduated from college. ""Your entire family die in a month and a half,"" she said. ""It's just so scary. I'm just so confused. I don't even know what to do."" There are several experimental drugs and vaccines being created for Ebola, Kieny said, though none has been through the necessary human trials to prove safety and efficacy. And none of them is currently available in unlimited supply. This outbreak, she said, is an opportunity to right a wrong. ""The fact that there is no drug for Ebola is a market failure. This is typically a disease of poor people in poor countries where there is no market."" Desperation has pushed Liberia's government to ask for the experimental serum used to treat the Americans and Spanish priest, in order to treat two local doctors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Liberia's request for access to ZMapp, which was created by the San Diego-based biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. Sample doses of the medicine will be sent to Liberia this week to treat doctors who have contracted the virus, the Liberian government said. Mapp Biopharmaceutical said Monday that its supply has been exhausted after fulfilling the request of a West African country. (It did not name the country.) Kentucky BioProcessing, which manufactures a version of the drug, is working to increase production of ZMapp, but the process will take several months, company spokesman David Howard said last week. ""There are not adequate supplies of any of the investigational agents anywhere near ready for human use,"" said Dr. Jesse Goodman, director of the Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship at Georgetown University Medical Center, referring to all drugs being developed to treat Ebola. ""Not (adequate) to treat all the patients in this outbreak, even if we knew they worked."" Questions about drug access . The gulf between developed and developing nations appeared to some to widen last week as reports emerged that the Ebola drug was being used to treat Westerners but not West Africans. ""What if it had killed both of them?"" Paul Root Wolpe, director of the Center for Ethics at Emory University in Atlanta, said about the two Americans first treated with ZMapp. ""It is only because it worked, seemingly very well, that people are screaming, 'How come people in Africa didn't get it?' "" Wolpe said that considering the converse situation could provide some perspective. ""If the first people (to receive doses of ZMapp) would have been Liberian, headlines would have screamed, 'Experimental drug tested on poor Africans,' "" Wolpe said. But the nagging question for some: Was giving the serum to Africans even a consideration? Should it have been? ""Why didn't Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, the chief Sierra Leone physician who died while treating Ebola patients, receive this medication?"" Harriet Washington wrote in a recent CNN Opinion piece. ""Because another method of determining who gets medications is at work here -- the drearily familiar stratification of access to a drug based on economic resources and being a Westerner rather than a resident of the global South."" WHO will convene a panel at the end of the month to discuss who should get priority access to the experimental drugs, Kieny said. WHO will not broker access, she noted, meaning it will not be responsible for doling out doses. It will simply provide information about companies that have quantities available to people or government agencies that are asking. Drug safety concerns . More relevant than who got what and when, experts say, are questions about the safety of the current crop of experimental Ebola drugs. For ZMapp and other Ebola drugs currently in the pipeline -- like TKM-Ebola by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals -- there are not good, substantive data in humans to support their use. ""Usually, you treat large numbers of sick people to be sure something isn't going to hurt them,"" said Goodman, former chief scientist with the Food and Drug Administration. ""So while it seems at first glance that two individuals getting something promising in animals and then improving, is convincing, I don't think it's yet convincing. I think it's hopeful."" Wolpe, Washington and Goodman agree that careful study should precede widespread dissemination of any Ebola drug and that Africans should be represented in those studies. ""If (ZMapp) turns out to be as effective as it seems to be, and it's possible to make much more of it, then we end up with a situation where it becomes unethical to withhold treatment,"" Wolpe said. ""We should do everything we can to nip this epidemic in the bud."" Ebola outbreak likely started with 2-year-old in Guinea . Nine things to know about the Ebola virus .

"(CNN) -- When news first broke about a month ago about enterovirus D68, also known as EV-D68, with hundreds of children hospitalized across the United States with respiratory illnesses, I definitely took notice. I clicked on a few news stories, like I'm sure many other parents did, especially since my girls, ages 6 and 8, were back at school and school, while wonderful, can also be a petri dish for young people. But then I must admit I kind of put the issue out of my mind, worrying instead about homework, the fall routine and whether my girls are getting enough sleep. (Their mom certainly isn't!) That was until I heard about a New Jersey 4-year-old who died in his sleep September 24. It is the first death health officials are directly linking to the virus. Tests have also shown EV-D68 in four other people who have died, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the role the virus played in those deaths ""is unclear at this time."" As of Monday, the CDC has confirmed 594 cases of enterovirus D68 in 43 states and the District of Columbia. When I put out a query to parents across the country on social media, asking if they are growing more anxious about the virus, many, like Cecily Kellogg, said they definitely are. ""I am way more interested and worried about enterovirus than Ebola,"" said Kellogg, a mom of an 8-year-old daughter in Philadelphia and host of the blog Uppercasewoman.com. ""While my daughter is (blessedly) healthy as could be with completely healthy lungs, and goes to a smaller school with fewer virus exposures, I still worry (particularly since, I, sadly, do have unhealthy lungs and while this is not an adult virus, I am still hyperaware)."" Avital Norman Nathman, whose son is 7, said her child's elementary school recently sent an email to parents letting them know a few students were home with a respiratory illness and one was hospitalized. The school did not make it clear if any of the children had enterovirus, she said. But despite that alert, she said she's not in the ""freak out"" camp about the illness. ""In the large picture, there are really only a small number of cases of the virus across the country, but I think the media focus causes people to panic (and) worry about it,"" said Norman Nathman, editor of the motherhood anthology ""The Good Mother Myth"" and host of the blog The Mamafesto. ""It's definitely a scary illness but I'm not all that worried about my son contracting it."" Doctors urge parents to keep things in perspective. First, ""few people who contract EV-D68 develop symptoms other than a runny nose and a cough,"" said Dr. Andi Shane, associate professor of pediatrics and global health at Emory University's School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Secondly, the impact of EV-D68 is ""quite modest"" as compared to the flu, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases and epidemiologist for Primary Children's Hospital, which is part of Intermountain Healthcare in Utah. ""Flu kills several hundred children in an average year,"" said Pavia. ""This is dramatically more than the impact of EV-D68, but we are familiar with flu, while EV-D68 is something that seems new and noteworthy."" So, who is most at risk? It appears that children with asthma are more likely to develop significant symptoms than children without a history of breathing issues, doctors said. The most important sign that parents should be on the lookout for is trouble breathing. ""Children who may need medical attention may breathe fast, use their neck or chest muscles to breath, and feel as if they cannot catch their breath after coughing,"" said Shane, who is also the Marcus Professor of Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control at Emory. Children who may not be able to drink well may also require medical attention, she added, as well as any child who is not acting like his or herself. Many parents are heading to the doctor's office earlier than usual because of fears of enterovirus. Said a parent on Twitter, ""My child was sick last night. At dr today just to rule it out. Normally I would just keep close eye 4 a day."" Another concern for parents is figuring out when to keep children home from school to keep them safe. Pavia said he would not let fears a child will get the virus guide that decision. Many children will never catch it and most won't become seriously ill if they do, he said. Plus, he said the dangers may be decreasing. ""By this time in many cities, the virus is on the wane, so the risk is going down. In fact, many children have probably already been infected and are now immune but because the symptoms were not remarkable, no one knew."" The only reason to keep a child home, said Shane, is if the child is sick or if school officials advise children to stay home because other children in the school are hospitalized. The best prevention is exactly what you likely tell your children every day. They should wash their hands frequently and carefully, especially after using the bathroom, before eating and after they come into contact with people who have cold symptoms, Pavia said. There has been some speculation that hand sanitizers don't work with this virus, and that may be partially true, he added. ""Enteroviruses are somewhat more resistant to alcohol-based (sanitizers) than another viruses,"" he said, so soap and water is the best first choice and hand sanitizers are a good backup if you can't wash your hands. ""Doing something to wash your hands is better than doing nothing,"" he said. Norman Nathman said while she is not worried about her son getting the virus, she's taking advantage of all the attention. ""It's a good opportunity to do what we can to boost our children's immune systems, get flu shots and remind about best practices when it comes to hand washing, etc."" Are you growing more concerned about enterovirus D68?

"(CNN) -- He was the football star who came to symbolize one of the reasons why many argued Qatar shouldn't be allowed the right to stage the 2022 World Cup. On Friday, a year to the day since he returned to Paris following his painstaking exit from Qatar, Zahir Belounis will take a moment to remember the scarring experience of being trapped inside his Doha apartment for months on end. ""I cannot forget what happened...my head is still in that place,"" former French-Algerian football player Belounis told CNN. ""I never did anything wrong but my life was ruined and for what? ""Perhaps I don't understand the seriousness of what I achieved in getting out and being able to tell my story. ""It's not just about me -- it's about all the people like me who have also suffered."" Last year, on November 28, Belounis was reunited with his mother and family after returning to France along with his wife Johanna and two small daughters. Belounis had become the face of the struggle against ""kafala"" -- the system which ties employees to a specific employer within Qatar. Fiercely criticized by pressure groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, ""kafala"" has been labeled as facilitating modern day slavery, though recently Qatar said it had been making progress in reforming the system. Stranded in Qatar following a 18-month pay dispute with football club El Jaish, Belounis was finally allowed to leave the Gulf State after a lengthy campaign by human rights groups and those on social media. Belounis, who had plied his trade in the lower divisions of French and Swiss football, moved to Qatar in 2007 and initially enjoyed success. In 2010, he was offered a new five-year contract and signed the deal with the ambition of taking El Jaish into the nation's top division, which he achieved the following year. But once El Jaish was promoted, Belounis was sidelined and told he would not play again. There started the problem with his contract -- the club paying him only a small amount of what he was owed until the money stopped completely. For 18 months he struggled to feed his family, desperately contacting the French government and President Francois Hollande for help while he also sent an open letter to Pep Guardiola and Zinedine Zidane, two of the most famous men in football. The Qatari Football Association denied Belounis' allegations, stating that it had helped him recover unpaid wages from a previous club in the country and said the player had not lodged a complaint against El Jaish. In telephone conversations with CNN before he left Qatar, the footballer confessed he had been driven to drink and suicidal thoughts. Even now, some 12 months later, it remains a difficult subject, both for him and his family. ""As a mother, there is nothing worse on earth than seeing your son screaming for help, crying on the phone, hearing him on TV, on radio,"" Zahir's mother Fouzia told CNN. ""Of course I was aware that he wasn't held by some sort of terrorist group, but I felt like that every day. ""The worst was the article saying he was suicidal, but I want to forget that day, it is haunting me until today."" A photograph of Belounis emerging from the arrivals zone at Charles de Gaulle airport and moving almost immediately into the arms of his mother went viral online as the two embraced while cameras flashed and popped. ""I remember that night,"" said Belounis. ""I was alone in the bathroom and just remember thinking, 'I've had to come back to my mum's house like a kid.' ""I had my wife and children and here I was, back at home. It wasn't right. ""I was a grown man forced to crawl back to my mum -- it was embarrassing."" Belounis suffered from anxiety as he struggled to adjust to his new found freedom. ""When he arrived in Paris, he was like a traumatized animal, scared of everything,"" his brother Mahdi told CNN. ""It was almost impossible to make him smile or laugh."" Unable to settle in Paris, Belounis moved to Malaga in southern Spain where he found work at his friend's restaurant -- as a waiter. ""In life you have to work,"" he said. ""My friend wanted to help me and I am so grateful towards him. ""At first it was difficult because I was used to the good life, being a professional football player. ""But now I have learned the trade and I respect the job of a waiter. I've learned about the restaurant and I am grateful, although I never expected to finish my career like this."" Last week, Qatar was back in the headlines after winning the right to host the 2019 World Athletics Championship. The decision was met with criticism by human rights groups who are unhappy at the Gulf State's treatment of migrant workers. In a statement, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs insisted the country is making progress and expects labor reforms to be implemented over the coming months. ""A new sponsorship law, currently under review, that will replace the outdated ""kafala"" system will be announced by next year,"" said the statement. ""We are also working on laws to cover domestic workers. ""As in every country in the world, change does not happen overnight. Significant changes such as these take more time to implement that some may wish, but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in Qatar. ""Our plans are going through a legislative process and we expect to make announcements about new legislation by early next year."" While Belounis says he is encouraged by these developments, he is anxious to witness greater progress. According to a report by DLA Piper and confirmed by the government, 964 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal died while living and working in the country in 2012 and 2013. The International Trade Union Confederation has estimated that 4,000 workers could die while working on projects by the time the 2022 World Cup begins. According to the Qatari government, there are over 1.4 million foreign workers currently plying their trade in the country. ""Qatar's system is not a human system,"" Belounis said. ""I think they have no choice but to make changes now. ""The last time I heard the Emir speak, he said lots of good things but we want to see some action. We have to do something other than talk. ""I am a victim of the 'kafala' system and the rules need to be changed so it will never happen again."" Belounis is still awaiting news from the French justice ministry in his claim for unpaid wages against Qatari club El Jaish, though he insists his is a struggle that isn't just about money. ""This is about human rights. I hope one day I will see justice and that the Qataris will come out in public and admit they made a mistake. ""I want an apology. It's the only thing which will finish this episode."" Both his mother and brother are desperate for Belounis to put his time in Qatar behind him. ""Zahir is ready to fight even if we have to go to the European Court,"" said Mahdi. ""This isn't just about Zahir, it is about hundreds and thousands of people who are in the exact same position that he was once in. ""He is the symbol of this human disaster."" Meanwhile, Zahir's mother is very much aware of the emotional torment her son has experienced. ""I can see it in his eyes, because I know my son. And I felt he was internally destroyed and fragile. ""I lost the kid full of joy I knew from before. It will take time, but I will get him back, I am sure. As for Zahir he still has flashbacks -- the nights of sleeping on the floor in his Qatari home, crying while he held his daughters, remain fresh in the mind. Even now, the picture of his two young girls asking, ""What's wrong daddy?"" haunts him. The depression which led him to ponder suicide might have lifted but the memories haven't. ""I know that it will be a year since I came back but I just want to be alone,"" he said. ""I remember telling my little girls that 'Daddy doesn't have any strength to fight anymore' but here I am. ""I am proud of what has happened to me and to be the first to highlight this problem. ""Perhaps I haven't fully realized what I've done...but I will sit tomorrow night and I will remember.""","Zahir Belounis was a French-Algerian footballer .

"(CNN) -- After playing college football, working as a financial aid adviser and earning a master's degree, 25-year-old Andrew Fuller is back in high school. Fuller is a new teacher at Tri-Cities High School in East Point, Georgia. He made the move from Oregon to Georgia to join Teach for America, a non-profit organization that recruits non-traditional teachers to improve education for children in low-income communities. Fuller's passion for education stems from his own experience growing up. He was in a special education program from kindergarten to his senior year, and he felt stigmatized and overlooked. ""I never knew why. I never knew my disability,"" Fuller says. ""I never had an IEP, which is an individualized education program. I never had any of those things."" ""Just being in the classroom and just knowing that I'd been given up on sometimes, that I'm not receiving the work, it was heartbreaking,"" he says. A gifted athlete, Fuller was accepted to the University of Oregon on a football scholarship. He later transferred and finished his college career playing for the Portland State Vikings. ""At Portland State is where I began a foundation and vision, knowing football is not the only thing that I'm good at but I'm also good at being a student,"" Fuller says. ""That's why I began to put in the work as a student, taking that football mentality of working hard every day and lifting weights to the classroom and starting to train my mind."" Having found success off the field, Fuller's goal shifted from playing in the pros to giving back to children who are like he was. He continued his education at Portland State, earning a master's degree in special education. Then he applied to Teach for America. ""I felt that I wanted to be involved in the most high-need school but also have the backing of an organization that stood for what I embodied, which was: close the educational achievement gap,"" he says. Teach for America began in 1990 after founder Wendy Kopp proposed the idea in her senior thesis at Princeton University as a way to address educational inequality in the United States. The basic concept is to recruit highly successful individuals, often recent college graduates, to commit at least two years to teaching in a low-income community. ""Across the country what we are seeing in our low-income communities, unfortunately, is poverty oftentimes predicts destiny and where kids can go,"" says Shyam Kumar, the executive director of Teach for America in Metro Atlanta. He adds that ""attracting the most promising leaders into these classrooms is difficult."" Unlike Fuller, most participants, called corps members, did not study education. Many had never even considered education as a career before joining Teach for America. Rather, the movement looks for ""a substantial set of traits that make them do amazing things in the classrooms and take kids and put them on a path to a much higher life opportunity,"" Kumar says. ""Some of those things are achievement ... strong track records of leadership, organizational abilities, and just this relentless drive if you hit a problem you're going to be able to overcome it."" Once accepted, corps members attend a summer training institute before the school year starts to get them ready for the classroom. Jared Gourrier was an American Studies major at Union College in Schenectady, New York. Now he is in his second year teaching third-graders at Deerwood Academy in Atlanta, and he coaches football at Coan Middle School with two other corps members. ""For me, seeing that reality that a life can pretty much be determined by the third grade, it really made me care and understand so much more,"" he says. ""I have this unwavering dedication to it now."" As a first generation college graduate, Mini'imah Shaheed says she ""definitely thought that college meant that you did something else beyond teaching."" ""I had planned to do research and was planning to continue straight on into grad school and earn a Ph.D.,"" she says. She applied to the program after a Teach for America alum visited her campus, and she was accepted into the 2001 Atlanta corps. After her stint in the program she moved into administration, and today is in her first year as founding principal at KIPP STRIVE Primary School in Atlanta. ""Ideally, none on my students ever have to experience the achievement gap, based on the work that we do every day,"" Shaheed says. ""I'm still taking with me the mission of ensuring educational equity, but now I get to do it from the earliest grade level possible."" The Teach for America model is not without its critics. In a list attached to a letter to Congress, the National Educators Association wrote, ""Teach for America does not include a sufficiently rigorous teacher preparation program, nor does it yield retention rates that warrant a federal investment in the program,"" two points often cited by opponents of the program. Teach for America says that 66% of its corps members remain in the field of education after their initial commitment, but that does not always mean they stay on as teachers. ""There's the first half of the movement, which is really getting strong teachers,"" Kumar says. ""But there's a second half, which is continue to keep many of these folks in the classrooms but then also build this leadership force to be principals and superintendents and policymakers."" As for Fuller, he does not intend to remain in the classroom long-term but says his Teach for America experience is still vital to the impact he wants to have in the future. His goal is to become a principal and then a U.S. senator, addressing educational issues through national policy. ""I never want to lead anybody or teach anybody anything I've never done before, and so I don't want to be in the classroom or be in a leadership position telling my teachers how to teach,"" he says. ""And so being in the classroom will show me what the teachers need.""","Andrew Fuller joined Teach for America to help kids who are like he was .

"(CNN) -- Kimberly Ritter could not believe what she was seeing. Girls wearing almost nothing at all, suggesting all sorts of sexual acts, listed on page after page of Backpage.com's escorts section. When she looked closer at the photos, she noticed something eerie. She could recognize the rooms. Ritter is a meeting planner at Nix Conference and Meeting Management of St. Louis. She and her co-workers work with 500 hotels around the world and visit about 50 properties annually. She can identify many hotel chains used in escort ads by their comforters, bathroom sinks, air conditioning units and door locks. Sometimes, she can also identify a specific property. Meet Kimberly Ritter, sex trafficking sleuth. A child protection code of conduct . Ritter has become a force in the international anti-trafficking movement, where she uses her expertise to identify the mainstream middle-end and high-end hotels used by traffickers. She negotiates with hotels to fight trafficking at their properties, while also trying to convince hotel general managers that it's good business to fight trafficking through signing the Tourism Child-Protection Code of Conduct, a voluntary set of principles that businesses can adopt to fight trafficking. Her firm has created a version of the code for meeting planners and was the first signatory a few weeks ago. Ritter hopes to recruit other planners to sign on to the code. Once Ritter and her co-workers realized they could have an impact, ""we thought this should be something all meeting planners could do,"" she said. Although anti-trafficking organizations can't be sure how many people are forced into commercial sex work, the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking estimates that human trafficking is a $32 billion business worldwide, with $15.5 billion coming from industrialized countries. (That includes forced sexual and nonsexual commercial labor of adults and children.) An estimated 100,000 to 300,000 children are at risk of commercial sex exploitation in the United States, according to End Child Prostitution and Trafficking (ECPAT), which created the tourism code. The National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline (888-373-7888) has recorded 46,000 phone calls over the past four years requesting information, reporting tips about trafficking and connecting about 3,600 victims of sex trafficking to social services. (The hotline takes calls about sex or labor trafficking.) Trafficking isn't simply sex for sale . Sex trafficking isn't prostitution, which is engaging in sex with someone for payment. The crime of sex trafficking has three parties: one person holding the victim, while using ""force, fraud or coercion"" to make the victim engage in sex acts for payment, and the third party paying for the sex, said Brad Myles, executive director of the Polaris Project, which operates the hotline with funding from the U.S. government. If the victim is a child, no force, fraud or coercion is required for the sex to be a crime. Escort ads posted online don't obviously state that sex with children is being sold, Ritter said, but customers who want children know to look for words like ""fresh,"" ""candy"" and ""new to the game."" The underage victims are often runaways and victims of sexual abuse who are vulnerable to pimps promising modeling jobs, money, food and drugs. After a pimp and customer make a deal, usually online or over the phone, hotels are an obvious place where the sex can take place. ""There's privacy, a neutral place for a customer to come to, certain amount of anonymity and you don't have to stay long term,"" said Noelle Collins, an assistant U.S. attorney and human trafficking coordinator for the Eastern District of Missouri, who prosecutes these cases. ""This can happen anywhere, but hotels are logical places where it could be found."" Sex trafficking wasn't on Ritter's mind when she met with the U.S. Federation of the Sisters of St. Joseph to book the federation's 2011 conference. That year, the nuns decided to take a stand on the issue. ""We've always done some type of social action [at our conference],"" said Sister Patty Johnson, executive director of the federation, which encompasses the 16 congregations of Sisters of St. Joseph in the United States. ""We like to leave the city [we visit] a tiny bit better than when we came."" The nuns told Nix they wanted their hotel to sign the tourism code of conduct developed by ECPAT, a worldwide network of organizations and individuals that fights commercial sex exploitation of children. Hilton Worldwide, Wyndham Worldwide, Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group (which includes the Radisson brand) and Delta Air Lines are all signatories to the code. After Ritter's initial online research turned up hotels she recognized, she agreed to raise the issue with their potential venues. Hotels can train to fight trafficking . Many hotel executives have security measures designed to fight trafficking but express concern about being publicly identified with the issue. An exception is Millennium Hotel St. Louis general manager Dominic Smart. After learning about the problem, Smart got his parent company's permission to become a pilot program. Often, hotel executives don't want customers to think their hotels have a prostitution or sex trafficking problem. (The code requires annual reporting.) Smart, who said he hasn't had a case yet, didn't worry about it. Previously on CNN: Wyndham chain boosts staff training to fight child prostitution . ""We felt it was our responsibility to get involved and fight human trafficking,"" said Smart, whose hotel signed onto ECPAT, went through training for managers and line staff, and hosted the nuns' conference. Training of hotel staff is key, said Michelle Guelbart, project coordinator for ECPAT-USA. Hotel managers may never spot the signs of sex trafficking, but housekeeping and room service employees often know something isn't right. They're just not sure what. ""Hotel rooms are used as venues for exploitation,"" Guelbart said. ""A pimp might hold up one or two girls in a room and might run traffic out of a room. They'll post ads on a website and send a girl to the room next door."" Learn the signs of trafficking victims . Red flags to watch for: Someone besides the guest rents a room, checks in without luggage and leaves the hotel. The child left in the room may seem confused about his or her own name; may appear helpless, ashamed, nervous or disoriented; may show signs of abuse such as bruising in various stages of healing; or may have tattoos that reflect money or ownership. The child usually doesn't have any spending money or identification; cannot make eye contact; and wears clothes printed with slogans such as ""Daddy's Girl"" or inappropriate clothes for the weather. Sometimes, the child will come on to various men during the check-in process. ""We've trained them on the red flags, what to look for,"" Smart said. ""If they see them, they report it to their manager and we would take over from there. The manager can assess and go to the police if need be."" How to help . Guests can report signs of trafficking . Hotel guests can also keep their eyes open for those red flags, said social worker Theresa Flores, an Ohio-based survivor of underage sex trafficking and an anti-trafficking activist. Guests who see the red flags can simply call the national hotline to report their suspicions, without ever leaving their names. Flores often travels to cities with big sports events and political conventions to educate hotel and motel owners, donating thousands of bars of soap listing the hotline for victims and witnesses to trafficking. Most of the country's state attorneys general and many anti-trafficking activists blame Backpage.com and other websites for not doing enough to fight sex trafficking. Backpage's lawyer says the company takes many steps to fight the problem. ""Any adult ads that are posted are monitored in real time, 24/7,"" wrote Steve Suskin, legal counsel for Village Voice Media, which owns Backpage, in an e-mailed statement to CNN.com. ""All nudity is banned, even for adult ads, and anyone who attempts to post an ad that's suggestive of an underage or exploited minor is immediately reported to NCMEC [the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children], which is designated by the FBI to alert local law enforcement to rescue any child at risk in a hotel or other location."" Unlike other websites, Backpage doesn't allow Web posters to post anonymously, Suskin wrote. ""Backpage charges $1.00 to post in personals, because it holds users accountable and provides credit card information to police so they can identify, locate, arrest and prosecute those who use common carriers to prey on children,"" he wrote. ""We continue to invest millions of dollars in human, technological, and other resources to detect and report suspected child predators and to help law enforcement apprehend and prosecute them."" With so much of the sex trafficking business migrating to the Internet, the crime still has to take place somewhere. ""Hotels can really be part of the solution,"" said Myles, the Polaris Project executive director. ""These are crimes, these are ways that women are being mistreated, and these are forms of violence against women. A lot of hotels don't want to be associated with it.""","U.N.: Human trafficking a $32 billion business, about half that amount from developed nations .

"(CNN) -- An 18-year-old Panamanian fisherman who survived 28 days adrift at sea is suing Princess Cruise Lines, arguing that one of its cruise ships should have stopped and saved him. A negligence lawsuit filed in Florida last week says the behavior of officers or crew members of the Star Princess was ""outrageous and, under the circumstances, so beyond all bounds of decency as to be regarded as shocking, atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community."" Three passengers who were birdwatching on the ship alerted a crew member when they spotted Adrian Vasquez and his companions signaling for help from their fishing boat, the suit says. Even though crew members ""had clear knowledge that people were stranded in an open boat hundreds of miles from shore in the Pacific Ocean and desperately calling for their help,"" the suit says, ""they consciously ignored the emergency situation and did not deviate from their cruise."" The fishing boat, Fifty Cents, had been adrift for 15 days when it crossed paths with the Star Princess on March 10, according to the lawsuit. At the time, all three fishermen aboard were alive. Later that day, according to the lawsuit, 16-year-old Fernando Osorio died, ""having lost all hope as the Star Princess steamed away."" Five days later, another fisherman on the broken-down boat, Oropeces Betancourt, 24, died at sea. Two days after spotting the struggling fishermen, the three cruise ship passengers followed up with a ship officer, asking him what happened to the fishing boat after their report, according to the lawsuit. ""This officer did not have an answer for them and walked away without explanation,"" the lawsuit says. Princess Cruises spokeswoman Karen Candy did not comment on this specific allegation Monday, adding that the company was still investigating the incident. Robert Dickman, a lawyer for Vasquez, speculated that one reason the Star Princess did not stop was because the cruise ship's crew didn't want to get off schedule for their next stop in Puntarenas, Costa Rica -- and, thus, lose money. The ship did arrive in Puntarenas on March 11, noted Candy, but she strongly denied that the crew decided not to help the fishermen for financial reasons. ""This is absolutely false,"" she told CNN by e-mail. Princess Cruises released a statement Monday saying it was ""deeply saddened that two Panamanian men perished at sea"" and ""very sorry for the tragic loss of life."" ""Because of what we suspect was a case of unfortunate miscommunication, regretfully the captain of the Star Princess was never notified of the passengers' concern. Had he been advised, he would have had the opportunity to respond, as he has done numerous times throughout his career,"" the statement said. ""This is an upsetting and emotional issue for us all, as no employee onboard a Princess ship would purposefully ignore someone in distress. It is our ethical and maritime responsibility to provide assistance to any vessel in need, and it is not an uncommon occurrence for our ships to be involved in a rescue at sea. In fact, we have done so more than 30 times over the last decade."" Jeff Gilligan, one of the cruise ship passengers who said he saw the stranded fisherman and alerted the cruise ship's crew, told CNN last month that he took a picture of the fishing boat from about two miles away. ""It's just a horrible thing. I'm sick about it,"" he said. He saw the tiny vessel through high-powered scopes, he said. It appeared not to be moving, he said, but the men onboard were. ""We were looking through powerful spotting scopes before I took those photographs, and we -- the three of us -- couldn't come up with any reasonable explanation why somebody would have been flagging with two different colors of cloth, clothing or whatever it was, to our ship from perhaps two miles away on a little boat that wasn't moving, over 100 miles from the coast,"" he said. At the time, he and his fellow passengers thought the cruise ship crew members would do something. ""We fully expected the ship to turn around or to send a tender boat out to investigate ... our suspicions,"" he said. Vasquez's lawsuit seeks compensation for physical, emotional and psychological injuries that it alleges he suffered as a result of the conduct of cruise line employees. The story of Vasquez's survival gained international coverage when the Ecuadorian navy rescued him north of the Galapagos Islands in March. The trio's February 24 fishing trip had started out well, according to Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz. The three caught plenty of fish, she said. But the boat's engine died without warning and, with no tools and scant navigational experience, there was little the trio could do, de la Cruz told CNN. Ecuadorian Rear Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle said that at the time he was found, the 18-year-old showed ""severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition."" He said the survivor had thrown his friends' bodies into the ocean ""because they had become badly decomposed."" CNN's Brian Todd, Dugald McConnell, Catherine E. Shoichet and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","NEW: Princess Cruises denies a lawyer's claim its crew didn't stop for financial reasons .

"(CNN) -- It is difficult being an American Muslim engaged in civic activities, let alone working in government or politics. We Muslims must always second-guess what we say, guard against people questioning our loyalty and make sure that nobody thinks we are trying to infiltrate the government to sabotage it from within and hand it over to the Muslim Brotherhood. Most Americans would dismiss these accusations, especially the last one, as outrageous conspiracy theories written by loonies on their blogs. Yet American Muslim public servants are facing these charges from sitting members of Congress. The sad reality is that it has been happening for a decade, and has been met with complete indifference from the media and the public. Recently, Rep. Michele Bachmann, briefly the front-runner for GOP presidential candidate, sent letters to the State Department, Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security asking them to investigate American Muslim organizations, individuals and government employees to determine if they are infiltrating the government and sabotaging it from within. This week, Newt Gringrich wrote an op-ed defending Bachmann's request. Bachmann and her friends -- Republican representatives Trent Franks of Arizona, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Tom Rooney of Florida and Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia -- pulled out all the stops. They not only hurled these outrageous claims at our organization, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and others like ours, but also accuse Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's deputy chief-of-staff of being part of the conspiracy. Huma Abedin, married to former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, has served Clinton since she was the first lady. The slurs against her are beyond malicious. They accuse Abedin's late father and her family of being a part of an international conspiracy seeking to sabotage the United States. This latest witch hunt comes as no surprise to those of us in public life. This is a natural next step for hate mongers. First, people who do not have mainstream political backing start the rumors. Next, if we take a page from Sen. Joseph McCarthy's 1950s playbook, the rumors become accusations leveled by the most politically privileged. It's simple -- the more accusations thrown at American Muslims trying to serve their country, the harder it is for them to be hired and the more politicians shy away from engaging them. For years, we have watched presidential candidates talking about their discomfort with appointing Muslims to senior positions in government. We have seen them sparring over our ethics and principles. Legislation against Sharia law has been introduced in 20 states, frightening residents into thinking Sharia is an imminent threat. President Obama still faces vicious and pointed accusations of being a Muslim, as though it were a slur. These attacks are real and hurt people's lives. Public servants have been forced out of jobs, with suspicion shadowing them. Very few public officials have had the courage to publicly condemn the escalating witch hunt. Will this latest absurdity finally force our politicians and policy-makers to not only defend someone like Huma Abedin, whose public service needs no defense, but also all American Muslims who serve this country every day? A few Republicans have rallied to Abedin's side. This week, Ed Rollins, Bachmann's former campaign chief, denounced her in an op-ed on Fox News. Speaker of the House John Boehner defended Abedin's character. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain felt compelled to stand on the floor of the Senate and denounce the accusations. ""Ultimately, what is at stake in this matter is larger even than the reputation of one person. This is about who we are as a nation, and who we aspire to be,"" he said. The question is whether this incident will serve as a tipping point. Will our political and religious leaders and the media push back against Islamophobes whose clear agenda is to marginalize American Muslims? Will this wave of McCarthyism be exposed, condemned and made politically unacceptable? Will American Muslim public servants be able to serve their country without suspicion? Every year, my organization brings 25 young American Muslim leaders to Washington to help them better understand policy making. The majority are inspired to develop careers in government and public service. Yet every year I ask myself: Are these individuals better off in banking, medicine and less high-profile careers? Am I exposing them to a career that will be tarnished by the likes of Michele Bachmann? In the end, I still believe that the sacrifice to serve this nation and make America a better place is worth the headache, and heartache, of dealing with bigots -- including those in Congress. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Haris Tarin.","Haris Tarin: American Muslims in public life face constant scrutiny over loyalty .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Twitter has been the scene of a bizarre Turkish hashtag war between the mayor of Ankara and, well, a lot of other social networkers. The drama began Sunday when Ibrahim Melih Gokcek, the man who has been mayor of Turkey's capital for more than a decade, accused a reporter from the BBC's Turkish service of being a foreign agent. ""Who is @selingirit? BBC's reporter in Turkey,"" Gokcek wrote in a series of English-language tweets. ""Led by England, they are trying to collapse our economy via agents hired, both nationally and internationally. They are dreaming for Turkey to be the 'Sick man of Europe' once again. Here is a concrete proof."" The BBC issued a statement Monday expressing concern about what it described as threats issued by Turkish officials against a BBC correspondent. Gokcek is an elected official from the Justice and Development Party, or AKP, which is led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Since an unprecedented explosion of street protests against Erdogan erupted more than three weeks ago, the prime minister and his deputies have accused demonstrators of being terrorists and vandals organized by an alleged shadowy foreign conspiracy Erdogan has labeled ""the interest lobby."" Gokcek appeared determined to prove this Sunday via Twitter. Shortly after accusing Girit of being a spy, he announced the creation of the Turkish hashtag #INGILTEREADINAAJANLIKYAPMASELINGIRIT, which translates roughly to ""Don't be a spy in the name of England Selin Girit."" Then, the mayor of Ankara launched a campaign to make the hashtag one of Twitter's worldwide trends. For the next several hours, he cheered on his followers as the accusation gained online traction with messages like ""Keep going Turkiye. Our Hash Tag is ranked 2th. Must place to number 1. This will be our answer to BBC."" Within hours, the mayor's Twitter campaign appeared to have backfired. Online opponents began mobilizing their own hashtag in response to the mayor of Ankara. They began retweeting the hashtag #provokatormelihgokÃ§ek (Melih Gokcek is a provocateur). By Sunday night in Turkey, #provokatormelihgokcek had replaced the mayor's hashtag attacking Girit on Twitter's list of world-wide trends. Gokcek responded by threatening anyone in the world who retweeted the provocateur hashtag with legal action. ""My lawyer is going to sue everyone one by one who tweets #ProvokatorMelihGokcek No one can get away with anything because Turkey is a country of law,"" the mayor of Ankara announced on Twitter Sunday night. As of 10am in Istanbul Monday, the #provokatormelihgokcek hashtag was ranked as the second most popular worldwide trend on Twitter. The BBC issued a statement expressing concern about what it called ""the continued campaign of the Turkish authorities to discredit the BBC and intimidate its journalists."" ""A large number of threatening messages have been sent to one of our reporters, who was named and attacked on social media by the Mayor of Ankara,"" wrote Peter Horrocks, Global News Director of the BBC. Horrocks maintained that BBC reporters were committed to providing ""impartial and independent journalism."" He called on the Turkish government to use ""proper channels"" to make comments and complaints to the organization. For the last several years, press freedoms organizations have published a number of reports expressing alarm about the Turkish government's record of jailing journalists. ""The government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has waged one of the world's biggest crackdowns on press freedom in recent history,"" wrote the Committee to Protect Journalists in a 2012 report. Reporters Without Borders has labeled Turkey among the world's worst jailers of journalists, since scores of media workers are currently in prison, many of them awaiting trial on terrorism-related charges.","Ankara's mayor has used his Twitter account to accuse a BBC correspondent of spying .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Fernando Alonso declared he has reached the ""Last Chance Saloon"" as Formula One rolls into the Wild West of Texas for Sunday's U.S. Grand Prix. With three races left to run this season, the 33-year-old Ferrari driver has still not announced which team he will race for in 2015. It is widely expected Alonso -- a two-time world champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006 -- will leave Ferrari and be replaced by four-time Red Bull champion Sebastian Vettel. When asked by CNN in Austin if he felt he had reached the end of the road when it came to choosing a team capable of powering him to a coveted third world title, he responded: ""Probably yes. ""Winning or not winning is a matter of being in the right place, at the right moment. ""Definitely I want to win. I want to win the third title. I'm sure that I will have the opportunity in the next years."" Alonso is widely regarded as the most talented all-round driver among the current generation of racers. As such, the Spaniard is understood to hold the key to the major moves in F1's driver merry-go-round. Video: Race around the awesome Austin circuit . Vettel was asked at the Circuit of Americas why he has not revealed his plans despite announcing at the Japanese Grand Prix three weeks ago that he is leaving Red Bull at the end of the year. ""What's the delay? Because I'm not allowed yet,"" he explained. ""I think once it's out you can make it out for yourself."" Alonso remains coolly enigmatic about where his future lies and the feisty driver is probably enjoying teasing the media pack eager for answers. ""At the end of the day, it's my decision, what I want and what I need to do for my future,"" he said. ""I will try to do the best for me and for Ferrari as well, as I always did, I understand everyone but I need to choose. ""Let's wait. You want to know the taste before cooking the plate. Let's wait."" Alonso has been linked with a return to McLaren, where he endured a tumultuous 2007 season as then debutant Lewis Hamilton's teammate. He left in acrimonious circumstances after falling out over his status within the team. McLaren is entering a new phase next season with the return of its former engine partner Honda. But a return to McLaren could be doubly risky for Alonso as the Honda engines are as yet unproven. A potential move to McLaren has cast uncertainty over the future of the team's current drivers Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion for Brawn Grand Prix, and Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen. ""I try not to think too much about it, at least in a negative way,"" said Magnussen, who finished third on his grand prix debut in Australia. ""I still have a chance of being here next year so that's what I'm focused on. I can only do my best to really show that I can give them something positive for the future. ""You really need to deliver when you're a McLaren driver. I've got to do that. ""I think I've done a decent job this year, I know my potential and I know I can do a lot better. ""I don't have a Plan B. I'm fully focused on Plan A."" When Alonso signed for Ferrari in 2010, it looked like a match made in motor racing heaven. But although he narrowly lost the title to Vettel in 2010 and 2012, the famous Italian team has struggled to provide a car capable of consistently challenging for the title. Alonso is understood to feel it is time to move on although he said a reported sabbatical from the sport was ""unlikely."" The Spaniard is, at least, sanguine about the lessons he learned with Ferrari, with which he has won 11 grands prix. ""Getting the respect of everyone has more value sometimes,"" he told CNN. ""Like these five years at Ferrari. ""When I joined in September 2009 I didn't have the respect that I have now, in five years it was difficult but I grew up as a driver and a person."" Alonso may be older and wiser but F1's gunslinger is still calling the shots in the driver market.","Fernando Alonso is widely expected to leave Ferrari at the end of the season .

"(CNN) -- The residents of Colorado and Washington state have voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, and all hell is about to break loose -- at least ideologically. The problem is that pot is still very much illegal under federal law, and the Obama administration must decide whether to enforce federal law in a state that has rejected the substance of that law. What makes this development fascinating is that it brings into conflict two important strains of political thought in America: federalism and moralism. Federalists, who seek to limit the power of the federal government relative to the states and individuals, will urge a hands-off approach. Moralists, on the other hand, strongly believe in the maintenance of an established social order and will argue for continuing enforcement of federal narcotics laws. The new laws will pit those who want a small federal government that leaves businesses and individuals alone against those who want the government to actively enforce a traditional sense of public morality in areas such as narcotics, abortion and limitations on gay marriage. One aspect of this conundrum is the near-total overlap between federal and state narcotics laws. Simple possession of marijuana is made into a federal criminal case under 21 U.S.C. Section 844, and federal law oddly categorizes marijuana as a Schedule I narcotic, along with heroin and mescaline -- even as cocaine and opium remain on the less-serious Schedule II. While federal law typically won't provide jurisdiction over a street robbery or even a murder, it does allow federal courts to imprison someone for carrying a small bag of marijuana, even when state law says otherwise. Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana . Federal and state efforts to curb marijuana use through prosecution simply haven't worked. In 2010, four out of five of the 1.64 million people arrested for drug violations were accused of possession, and half of those arrests were for carrying what were often very small amounts of marijuana. Those hundreds of thousands of drug cases corresponded with an increase in marijuana use. If federal policy were about problem-solving, Colorado would not pose a dilemma, because prosecuting marijuana cases hasn't solved the problem of marijuana use. Federal drug policy, though, is very much driven by moralism rather than problem-solving. After all, we have spent billions of dollars -- about $20 billion to $25 billion a year during the past decade -- and incarcerated tens of thousands of people to punish drug possession and trafficking without ever successfully restricting the flow of marijuana or cocaine. If we think tough drug laws solve the problem of drug use, we are deluding ourselves. Rather, what sustains the effort is the bedrock belief that drugs are bad, and we must punish those who sell them or use them. Mass incarceration is justified by the belief that those we lock up simply deserve it. That sense of retributive morality does not stop at state borders. Federalism, though, demands that individual and state rights be honored above all but the most important federal imperatives. Should marijuana be legal? Readers debate pot laws . We are not a unitary state like many European nations, and part of the genius of the American experience is the delicate balance between federal and state powers desired by those wise men who crafted the mechanics of our government. The difference between federalism and the kind of moralism driving national narcotics policy is simply this: Federalism is a central principle built into the structure of our government through the Constitution. Abhorrence of marijuana use is not such a defining principle. To be true to our best values, federalism should win out. No doubt, the moralists will consider the regulations on marijuana ""too important"" to bow to federalism concerns, but their sway is limited. Our recent elections show the moralists to be in decline, as those who fought limits on gay marriage won across the board at the same time that marijuana was legalized. As a federal prosecutor, I had the privilege of representing the United States and a role in employing the singular power of prosecutorial discretion. The Obama administration should employ that discretionary power in line with our oldest and best principles and step back from continuing marijuana prosecutions in Colorado and Washington. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Mark Osler.","Colorado and Washington legalized recreational use of pot but it's illegal under federal law .

"(CNN) -- Weather, airfare and upcoming local events are criteria that typically factor into travel decisions. This week, however, far greater concerns are on the minds of potential visitors to Istanbul. Ongoing local protests, government retaliation and related unrest in the city have many wondering if they should pull the plug on upcoming trips or make any new plans at all. The British government has warned its citizens to avoid demonstrations in Istanbul and Ankara, and the US state department urges travelers to be ""alert to the potential for violence"". What began as a small, peaceful protest against a planned shopping mall in the city's Gezi Park has quickly turned into what some protesters now call a ""war zone,"" with police using brute force to quell demonstrations. A worldwide audience has watched as police fired water cannons and tear gas at defiant protesters in Taksim Square. Tourism crucial to Istanbul . According to the 2012 MasterCard Global Destinations Cities Index, Istanbul is among the fastest growing tourism markets in the world, receiving 11.6 million international visitors and earning $10.6 billion in travel revenue in 2012. The Turkish Statistics Institute reports the country's total tourism revenue for 2012 was $29.4 billion. According to an April report by TradeArabia, Turkey expects to receive 33 million international visitors in 2013. HÃ¼nkar Akipek, a young professional who has taken part in the protests, tells CNN that protestors are aware of the possibility that recent events will harm Istanbul's reputation abroad. ""Sure we are worried,"" says Akipek. ""I got so many emails, calls from my Turkish and non-Turkish friends abroad. ""I am careful to answer their question of 'What is going on there?' to not make any harm to Istanbul's reputation. This is where we live and where we want to go on living and raise our children. We do not want to damage our home."" ""Istanbul, a city that has always been known as Turkey's cultural heart, is turning into a war zone,"" says Royce Yakuppur, a local who has been to Gezi Park several times in recent days. ""Although the feeling of solidarity (among locals) should be applauded as a virtue, it is not enough to overcome the fears of tourists."" Unsurprisingly, local travel agencies report that some travelers have recently canceled trips to Istanbul or are having second thoughts about coming in the next few weeks. Yet ""many"" are still going ahead with their plans. No statistics on cancellations are available. Traveler's tales from a week of unrest . By and large, for visitors and locals alike, Istanbul feels safe. Travelers across the city tell CNN that while they've had to modify some plans, they've felt neither threatened nor endangered. Colombian tourist Juanita Pardo arrived in Istanbul on June 10. She says she didn't change her travel plans after learning of the protests, despite being warned by family members to avoid the area around Taksim Square. ""There was a lot of traffic, a lot of police, and (some) roads were closed so we chose to walk and couldn't go everywhere we wanted to,"" she says of touring the city in the midst of the protests. ""We had to cancel some plans, like having dinner at Mikla, which is located in Taksim, where we didn't want to go. ""We couldn't see Istiklal Street, which we had heard a lot about."" Kevin Patnode, a 23-year-old New Yorker who has been spent the past four summers in Istanbul as a coordinator for an English language program, arrived in Istanbul on June 4. ""The protests made me want to come even more,"" Patnode tells CNN. ""Besides Taksim Square, the surrounding areas are untouched by the current situation,"" he says. ""I even visited Gezi Park three times and never felt unsafe. Even though I speak no Turkish, I never felt out of place or that I was unsafe. ""The only change that has occurred has been my social life. Istanbul is a party city and Turks know how to have a good time. ""But after the protests, a lot of people find it inappropriate to be out and going to the bars and clubs surrounding Taksim. It is certainly not frowned upon for foreigners to go out and enjoy themselves, and I've been encouraged to go out and continue to enjoy Istanbul -- however I cannot expect my Turkish friends to come along and join me."" Most of Istanbul's top attractions, such as the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and TopkapÄ± Palace, are located in Sultanahmet, far from Taksim Square. Referred to as the ""new Berlin"" by some, Istanbul boasts a growing art scene, with contemporary galleries and museums, such as Salt Galata, Arter and the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art leading the field. Contemporary Turkish cuisine also draws tourists to Istanbul. The city's historic peninsula, funky cafes and bohemian neighborhoods feel as exciting -- and welcoming -- as always. ""Istanbul is as appealing as ever,"" insists one local. ""Much like a beautiful woman, but with smudged mascara.""","Demonstrations have many wondering if they should pull the plug on upcoming trips .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An 88-year-old Maryland man with a long history of ties to white supremacist groups is the suspect in Wednesday's fatal shooting at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, two law enforcement officials told CNN. The Web site Holy Western Empire includes writings by James von Brunn and a biography. James W. von Brunn served six years in prison for trying to make what he called a ""legal, non-violent citizens arrest"" of Federal Reserve Board members in 1981 -- a prison term he blamed on ""a Negro jury, Jew/Negro attorneys"" and ""a Jew judge,"" he said on his Web site, Holy Western Empire. ""He is in our files going back way into the 1980s,"" said Heidi Beirich, a researcher for the Southern Poverty Law Center, based in Montgomery, Alabama. ""He has an extremely long history with neo-Nazis and white supremacists. He's written extremely incendiary publications, raging about Jews, blacks and the like."" Von Brunn is a native of St. Louis, Missouri, and a 1943 graduate of Washington University there. According to his online biography, he served as a Navy officer in World War II and became an advertising artist and executive after the war. But by the late 1970s, Beirich told CNN, he had become a ""hard-core neo-Nazi"" and an associate of William Pierce -- the white supremacist leader whose 1978 book, ""The Turner Diaries,"" is blamed for inspiring Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.  Watch more about von Brunn's history with neo-Nazis » . In December 1981, angered by what he called the ""treacherous and unconstitutional"" acts of the Federal Reserve, von Brunn entered the central bank's Washington headquarters armed with a pistol, a shotgun, a knife and a mock bomb, according to court records. He claimed to be a photographer who wanted to shoot pictures of the boardroom, and bolted up the stairs when security guards told him to wait. While being subdued, he claimed to have planted a bomb, which forced the building's evacuation, court records state. He told officers he was upset over high interest rates -- then well into double digits -- and the state of the economy, which was in a recession. Von Brunn, then 62, was sentenced to 11 years in prison on attempted kidnapping, second-degree burglary, assault and weapons charges. Read more about von Brunn's criminal record . In a December 1984 appeal, his court-appointed attorney, John Hogrogian, asked the court to release the defendant on bail, saying his client had ""renounced his actions of December 7, 1981, and expressed remorse in a letter addressed to this court."" Von Brunn has ""a young son and aches to see him again,"" his lawyer wrote. His trial dealt extensively with Von Brunn's ""attitudes about black and Jewish people,"" which his lawyer said were irrelevant to the charges he was facing. Documents were read at trial in which von Brunn wrote, ""Goal: to deport all Jews and blacks from the white nations,"" among other racist statements. In his testimony, he also said ""the basic plan was to wind up where I am now,"" meaning in court to raise publicity for his campaign against the Federal Reserve. In a telephone interview with CNN, Hogrogian said that he never met von Brunn, since his client was serving his time in Ray Brook Federal Prison in upstate New York. He said that von Brunn had approached a guard at the Federal Reserve carrying a rifle, but put his rifle on the ground and surrendered when told that he would not be allowed entry. Hogrogian said he was surprised to hear Wednesday that his former client had shot anyone. ""I thought it was absolutely consistent with him to lay down his weapon, as he did in '81, because he viewed himself as a man of honor, military code and all that kind of stuff."" Von Brunn had told him he served as a PT boat captain during World War II, Hogrogian said. Hogrogian, who now works for the New York City Law Department, said the two men often communicated via telephone. ""He was an intelligent guy, he was well-spoken,"" he said. ""Didn't seem like a rabid kind of guy. He seemed sincere in his beliefs."" One of those beliefs was that the Federal Reserve was ""debasing the American currency and sapping America's financial strength in the face of the communist threat, or something,"" Hogrogian recalled. The appeal was based on the assertion that von Brunn's lower-court conviction should have been thrown out, Hogrogian said. ""When he was arrested in 1981, he had on his person a 12-page manifesto, which went into stuff about racial and ethnic stuff,"" the lawyer said. ""That manifesto was read to the jury at his criminal trial, which I thought was unnecessary and inflammatory. ... There's no way he could get a fair trial reading this manifesto to the jury."" In an unpublished opinion, the three-member panel on the court of appeals disagreed and upheld the lower court's conviction of von Brunn. Though von Brunn did not attend Hogrogian's oral argument before the D.C. Court of Appeals, several of von Brunn's supporters did -- ""people who call themselves patriots, before they had militias and all that white supremacy stuff ... he called himself a patriot. That was his thing."" The lawyer said one of the ""patriots"" approached him in a hallway of the courthouse and told him, ""I'm a friend of Jim. When we watch the football game and they play the national anthem, he stands in the room and makes everyone else stand at attention."" The appeal was denied. Hogrogian said he could not remember whether von Brunn thanked him afterward, but did remember that von Brunn's Web site accuses him of having made mistakes in the appeal. Asked whether he had done so, the 59-year-old responded, ""Well, I was a young lawyer. I did the best I could."" He added, ""The D.C. Court of Appeals found no mistakes."" Von Brunn's Web site proclaims itself ""a new, hard-hitting expose of the Jew conspiracy to destroy the white gene-pool."" Postings attributed to von Brunn have appeared on numerous other sites, including ones that call the Holocaust and ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" hoaxes and bemoan the decline of the ""Aryan gene pool.""  Watch more about von Brunn's Web site » . ""Bit by bit Liberalism ascended. Bit by bit the Constitution was re-interpreted. Bit by bit government institutions and Congressmen fell into JEW hands -- then U.S. diplomacy, businesses, resources and manpower came under JEW control,"" one such message reads. ""Whitemen sat on their collective asses and did NOTHING -- NOTHING BUT TALK."" More recently, messages attributed to von Brunn question the authenticity of President Obama's birth certificate, the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. Advocates of those theories imply that Obama was born overseas and therefore would be constitutionally ineligible to hold office. Von Brunn was in critical condition Wednesday after being shot by a security guard at the museum. Another guard, Stephen Tyrone Johns, was killed in the shooting, museum officials said.

"Havana (CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro said Sunday that he would step down from power in 2018, when his second term as president is set to end. ""I would like to make clear ... this will be my last term,"" he said during a nationally televised speech at the end of a session of the country's National Assembly. The announcement came shortly after lawmakers re-elected Castro to a second five-year term. Last year, Castro said that Cuban officials, including the president, should be limited to two terms in office. He was officially elected president of the island nation in 2008. In 2018, he will be 86. Castro took over from his ailing, older brother, Fidel Castro, whom he quoted liberally on Sunday. ""I quote: 'Revolution is the sense of the historical moment, to change everything that must change. It is equality and freedom. It is to treat and treat others as human beings. It is to emancipate ourselves with our own efforts. It is to defy powerful forces in and out of the social and national context ... It is to fight for our dream of justice for Cuba and the world, the fundamentals of our patriotism, and socialism, and our internationalism.' May this marvelous definition serve as a guide for the new generations of patriots and Cuban revolutionaries,"" Castro said. Illness forced the elder Castro to step down after nearly 50 years in power. Also Sunday, lawmakers elevated Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, 52, to the position of first vice president, putting him next in line to succeed Castro. He is the first member of the generation born after the Cuban Revolution to reach the powerful position and stands in contrast to many of the octogenarian military officials who hold top positions in the government. Diaz-Canel previously served as one of five second vice presidents and as minister of higher education. Trained as an electrical engineer, he has a reputation among many Cubans as a plainspoken problem solver. Castro spoke glowingly of Diaz-Canel, saying his rise marks a ""definitive step in the configuration of the future leadership of the country, through the gradual and organized transfer to the new generation taking over the main roles."" While not as widely known as other officials, Diaz-Canel last month headed a Cuban delegation that attended a large pro-government demonstration in Venezuela. The event marked the day that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was due to have been sworn in for a new term. But Chavez missed his inauguration to receive cancer treatment in Cuba. Castro also announced Sunday that Esteban Lazo Hernandez, 68, would assume the role of president of the National Assembly. Lazo had previously served in a variety of other roles, including second vice president. Lazo replaces Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, who was the National Assembly president for 20 years and often acted as the point person for negotiations with the United States. However, Alarcon's political future was clouded last year by the arrest of a top deputy on corruption charges. Alarcon will now lead the government's effort to free five Cuban intelligence officers sentenced to jail in the United States, Cuban officials said. Before his formal televised remarks on Sunday, Castro bantered with other high-ranking officials. At one point, he said that the National Assembly should change venues from the drab convention center where it now meets to Havana's Capitol building. ""It's a jewel,"" Castro said. ""It's true there was a time during the era of capitalism that's where all the bandits met but not any longer now that its ours."" The Capitol, a replica of the one in Washington, was previously the seat of government in Cuba but has mainly sat unused since the 1959 revolution. Castro then asked how long it had taken to build the Capitol in Havana during its construction in the 1920s. ""A little more than two and a half years,"" replied Eusebio Leal, Havana's historian and member of the assembly. ""And how long would it take to build today?"" Castro asked, referring to the cost overruns and inefficiency endemic to Cuban government construction projects. ""Not less than five,"" said Vice President Ramiro Valdez, who fought alongside Castro in the revolution and now oversees government public works. Castro disagreed, saying the current government could not erect the same building in the less than 15 years. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Raul Castro is re-elected to a second five-year term .

The same day, on the photo-sharing website Flickr, Mills wrote, ""I have lost my compass and find myself adrift in a sea of chaos. Goodbye my friends.

"(CNN) -- After an extensive, month-long buildup, Yahoo has finally unveiled its new logo. Overall the look is cleaner and thinner, and it is a new sans-serif typeface created by Yahoo. The logo is still purple, though a shade darker, and features all the usual uppercase letters in the same order finished off by the signature exclamation point, which dances around in some versions. Yahoo posted two flavors of the new look to its Tumblr at midnight on Thursday. One is white text on a purple background, the other purple text on white background. Both have a slight beveled effect, though it's more noticeable on the purple text. It has already replaced the logo that appears on the top left corner of Yahoo.com. ""We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.,"" wrote CEO Marissa Mayer in a blog post on Tumblr, which Yahoo bought earlier this year. ""We didn't want to have any straight lines in the logo. Straight lines don't exist in the human form and are extremely rare in nature, so the human touch in the logo is that all the lines and forms all have at least a slight curve,"" Mayer added in her post, which goes into exhaustive detail about the thinking behind the logo. In a recent internal poll of Yahoo employees, 87% wanted the logo changed, Mayer said. Yahoo managed to turn a simple rebranding into an impressive marketing push by dragging it out for 30 days. For the past month, the company has rotated out the logo on its homepage daily with one of the runnersup. Some of the 29 logos were a lot more unusual than the final choice, perhaps to make fans appreciate the reserved simplicity of the final look. ""Sharing these logo variations prepares people for change, so there's less risk of what happened to Gap,"" said David Airey, a graphic designer specializing in brand identity. When Gap tried changing its logo in 2010, there was an outcry among Gap loyalists and logo enthusiasts. The clothing company eventually caved and switched back to its old logo. Yahoo's logo redesign was headed up by an in-house branding group and product designers, according to AdAge. It is likely just one of the more noticeable elements of a larger rebranding effort for the struggling company, which Mayer has re-energized since becoming CEO last year. ""The logo is only part of a brand new branding and image campaign. It signals to consumers, investors and employees that change is coming,"" said Columbia business school professor Bernd Schmitt. The new logo is probably not different enough to raise much ire (or eyebrows) among Yahoo users, although some Internet critics were unimpressed. On Twitter, the reaction to the logo was less than enthusiastic. ""The new Yahoo logo looks like it got run through Alien Skin Eye Candy on Photoshop 4.0.,"" said Justin Williams. ""A bad logo is all it took for Yahoo! to make everyone talk about it,"" tweeted Preshit Deorukhkar, editor of design publication Beautiful Pixels. Yahoo hasn't updated its logo since 2009, and it has been mostly the same since 1995. The move to change it now is logical given its Mayer's recent attempts to breathe new life into the brand. ""More often than not, when a company's identity looks a little tired (or more likely when new leadership wants to put their own stamp on things), what's already in place won't need to be thrown out. It'll just need to be freshened up,"" said Airey.","After 30 days of teasers, Yahoo has unveiled its new logo .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered 17,600 troops near the Ukrainian border to return to their bases, state-run media reported. The reason? The Russian troops' training exercises in the southern Rostov region have ended, according to the RIA Novosti news agency. But many did not believe such exercises were taking place. The troop buildup near the Ukrainian border has been widely interpreted as a threat to invade eastern Ukraine. If the troops do indeed leave the border area, the withdrawal could mark a removal of that threat. So far, NATO has not confirmed whether the troops have actually began to withdraw. Tensions in the region have flared since April, when separatist leaders in Ukraine declared independence from Kiev and violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia. The conflict between the pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian military has cost more than 2,500 lives, according to the United Nations. War: What is it good for? Russia's announcement of the troop pullback comes as Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko prepare to meet in Milan on sidelines of the Asia-Europe Meeting later this month. In another sign that tensions have cooled somewhat, Ukrainian emergency services will be granted passage Monday to the site in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine where Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed in July. After negotiations led by the Organization for the Security and Co-operation in Europe, Ukrainian teams will be allowed to gather belongings of crash victims at the site and from locals in the area, Dutch Security and Justice Ministry Spokesman Jean Fransman told CNN. Ukraine and Russia have been under a shaky cease-fire since last month, when government officials from the two countries as well as rebel leaders from eastern Ukraine hashed out a deal in Belarus. Yet the bloodshed continued. Ten civilians were killed when a school in the city of Donetsk was shelled, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. And one day later, Swiss Red Cross worker Laurent DuPasquier was killed when a shell landed near an International Committee of the Red Cross building in Donetsk.

"(CNN) -- It's perhaps the unanswered questions after Brandon Goode's death that will haunt his parents the most. ""Words do not exist to express the measure of our sorrow and sadness,"" Ricke and Connie Goode said in a statement issued Wednesday to CNN affiliates WESH and Central Florida News 13. ""Whether mental illness, substance abuse or something else, we are a family searching."" Brandon Goode, 18, and Alexandria ""Alex"" Hollinghurst, 17, both of Davenport, Florida, are accused of fatally shooting a police officer before apparently committing suicide. Windermere police Officer Robert German called for support after witnessing Goode and Hollinghurst -- who had been reported missing -- walking along a street early Saturday. But when backup arrived, German was found lying on the ground, suffering from a gunshot wound, according to Polk County authorities. German, 31, was later pronounced dead at an Orlando hospital; the teens' lifeless bodies were discovered under brush not far from where German had been shot, county authorities said. A five-year veteran with the Windermere Police Department, German had just returned to the force after being on ""light-duty status"" following surgery for an injury he suffered several months ago, Windermere Police Chief David Ogden said. ""All he wanted to do is be a cop,"" the chief said. ""Officer German was a good cop. He was one of the finest police officers that we had in this agency."" The days leading up to the celebrated officer's death weave a complicated web that has left investigators puzzled over what happened. Just two days before the shooting, the two teens ran away from home, leaving only letters behind for their families to find. ""To my loving parents, I am sorry for all the pain and misery I have brought you both, not just now but from these past few years as well,"" begins Brandon Goode's note, hand-written in neat, even letters. ""I don't want to go through life knowing because of my mistakes that I amounted to nothing and was there fore (sic) a disappointment. Don't take that as me putting the blame on you because that is the furthest thing from the truth. Both of you have been so amazing with your constant help and support through my life."" Goode was arrested earlier this year for possessing alcohol while underage and possession of marijuana and had been arrested in 2012 for an aggravated assault on his mother, according to incident reports from the Polk County Sheriff's Office. ""I love you with all my heart,"" the letter reads. ""Please don't be sad, this is what I want now, I get to die peacefully with the woman I love, the woman of my dreams, my fiancÃ© (yes we were engaged!). I miss you both so much already."" Hollinghurst penned loving missives addressed to her sister and father, but to her mother, she directed a bitter letter that suggests the two had a turbulent relationship. ""Thank you, for trying to talk and understand me after me being honest, after trying to fix things, thank you for turning a conversation about depression and suicide into something about you,"" the letter says. ""If I had stayed another minute I would have painted the walls and stained the carpets with my blood, so you could clean it up."" Once the letters were found, the couple's parents called police to alert them to the teens' disappearances. Using cell phone tracking technology, Kissimmee police officers found the two parked in Goode's car. When the officer asked Goode to step out of the automobile, he ""cranked the vehicle, put the vehicle in drive and sped away,"" according to a Polk County Sheriff's Office incident report. Later that day, Kissimmee police filed a warrant to charge Goode with resisting a law enforcement officer without violence and reckless driving. The next day, German encountered the duo, stopped them and called for assistance, police say. The responding deputies found German ""lying on the roadway, mortally wounded,"" the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. The deputies performed what is called a tactical rescue, using a patrol car to shield their fallen comrade. That's when they heard two gunshots. Upon searching nearby woods, Orange County sheriff's deputies found Brandon Goode and Alex Hollinghurst dead, lying in some brush, from what are believed to be self-inflicted wounds. Windermere, just west of Orlando, is known for its luxurious homes and close-knit community. German's death profoundly affected its residents. ""Windermere's heart is broken. I had the opportunity to spend some time with his family this morning, and one thing that his mother shared with me was how he loved to be an officer and how he loved working for Windermere,"" Mayor Gary Bruhn said in a news conference this week. ""There's a real hole in our hearts right now."" A law enforcement processional and memorial service to remember German will be held Thursday. Goode's parents acknowledged the tragedy in their statement. ""We cannot comprehend the senseless loss of Officer German's life, the death of Alexandria Hollinghurst and for our family, the loss of our 18 year old son, Brandon,"" the note says. ""Our deepest sympathy and our heartfelt prayers go out to the friends and family of Officer German. We are so, so sorry to them for what happened and they will be forever in our prayers. We know a community grieves and like everyone else in our community, we ourselves are struggling to understand this most horrific tragedy. We have no answers, only questions.""

According to People, the singer refuted rumors that her recent illness was anything other than the reported bad reaction to medicine. It led to the rescheduling of some dates for her ""Bangerz"" tour. Cyrus insisted she is ""the poster child for good health"" while speaking Tuesday during a press conference at London's O2 Arena in anticipation of her rebooted European tour. ""I didn't have a drug overdose,"" she said. ""I took some s****y antibiotics that a doctor gave me for a sinus infection and I had a reaction.""

"(CNN) -- Dubai, long champion of all things biggest, longest and most expensive, will soon have some competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia. Dubai's iconic Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, could be stripped of its Guinness title if Saudi Arabia succeeds in its plans to construct the even larger Kingdom Tower in Jeddah -- a prospect looking more likely as work begins next week, according to Construction Weekly. Consultants Advanced Construction Technology Services have recently announced testing materials to build the 3,280-feet (1 kilometer) skyscraper (the Burj Khalifa, by comparison, stands at a meeker 2,716 feet, or 827 meters). The Kingdom Tower, estimated to cost $1.23 billion, would have 200 floors and overlook the Red Sea. Building it will require about 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel, according to the Saudi Gazette. Building a structure that tall, particularly on the coast, where saltwater could potentially damage it, is no easy feat. The foundations, which will be 200 feet (60 meters) deep, need to be able to withstand the saltwater of the nearby ocean. As a result, Advanced Construction Technology Services will test the strength of different concretes. Wind load is another issue for buildings of this magnitude. To counter this challenge, the tower will change shape regularly. ""Because it changes shape every few floors, the wind loads go round the building and won't be as extreme as on a really solid block,"" Gordon Gill explained to Construction Weekly. Gill is a partner at Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the design architects for the project. Delivering the concrete to higher floors will also be a challenge. Possibly, engineers could use similar methods to those employed when building the Burj Khalifa; 6 million cubic feet of concrete was pushed through a single pump, usually at night when temperatures were low enough to ensure that it would set. Though ambitious, building the Kingdom Tower should be feasible, according to Sang Dae Kim, the director of the Council on Tall Buildings. ""At this point in time we can build a tower that is one kilometer, maybe two kilometers. Any higher than that and we will have to do a lot of homework,"" he told Construction Weekly.

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Ohio began presenting evidence to a grand jury on Monday in the August 5 death of Cincinnati man John Crawford III, shot and killed by police while carrying an air rifle in a Walmart store. Police contend that Crawford, 22, was ""waving a rifle-type weapon at customers, including children,"" according to statement from Beavercreek Police Capt. Eric Grile. Michael Wright, who is representing Crawford's family, says Crawford picked up an unwrapped air rifle from a shelf inside the store in Beavercreek and was talking on the phone when he was confronted by police. Witness Ronald Ritchie called 911 to report ""a gentleman walking around with a gun in the store,"" according to a recording of the call. Ritchie, who can be heard in 911 recordings released by the Beavercreek police department after the incident, says that a man was carrying what appeared to be a rifle, pointing it at people and ""waving it back and forth."" Then, there are muffled screams heard on the 911 tape, and Ritchie says he heard gunshots in the store. According to police, Crawford did not comply with police commands to drop the weapon. Crawford died shortly after being transported to a nearby hospital. His death was ruled a homicide by gunshot wound to the torso, according to the local coroner's office. ""The quick response [by police] was instrumental in containing this situation and minimizing risks to customers,"" Grile said in a statement at the time. The Ohio attorney general's office, which conducted the investigation into Crawford's death, has kept all details of its investigation under wraps pending the grand jury reviewing evidence and deciding whether charges should be filed. Surveillance video from inside the store has not been released to the public. ""Because it is an ongoing investigation, we have not released the video,"" Walmart spokesman Brian Nick told CNN. Two police officers -- Sgt. David Darkow and Officer Sean Williams -- were placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting but Darkow has returned to active duty, according to Beavercreek city attorney Stephen McHugh. The grand jury proceedings are expected to last several days, according to Hamilton County prosecutors, who are leading the team that is presenting evidence to the Greene County panel. Beavercreek, where the incident occurred, is in Greene County outside Dayton. ""After all the evidence is presented, we would like to see an indictment handed down on the police officers,"" Crawford family attorney Wright told CNN. Wright has continued to push for the public release of Walmart surveillance video from the incident, but law enforcement officials have asked the store not to release it publicly, Walmart spokesman Nick said. ""We are deeply saddened about the loss of life that occurred,"" Nick added. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and loved ones of those involved."" Crawford was a high school graduate and father of two, according to his father, John Crawford Jr., who addressed the press shortly after his son's death. ""My son was not a monster. He was a loving father, he was a loving son,"" the elder Crawford said. Wright said that both the victim's father and his mother, Tressa Sherrod were scheduled to testify before the grand jury on Monday. The grand jury proceedings are expected to last several days, according to a statement by Hamilton County prosecutors. CNN's Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","John Crawford III was shot, killed by police inside a Walmart in Ohio in August .

"(CNN) -- For centuries, man has been on a quest to find the elixir to eternal life. Alchemists struggled fruitlessly to create the legendary philosopher's stone, a mythical substance capable of turning base metals into precious gold and said to hold the key to immortality. But perhaps they were going about it the wrong way. Instead of searching for answers on land, maybe they should have been looking to the sea. In the seaside town of Shirahama, in Japan, one man thinks he knows what holds the key to everlasting life: jellyfish. Shin Kubota is a professor at Kyoto University's Seto Marine Biological Laboratory. He began studying the gelatinous sea creatures in 1979, and there's one type with which he's particularly preoccupied: the scarlet jellyfish. ""They don't die,"" Kubota says, ""they rejuvenate."" He adds that they are one of three jellyfish species in japan that are considered ""immortal."" ""One day in my plankton net, there was a small scarlet jellyfish from (the) south, which had many sharp sticks stuck into its body,"" he recalls. ""I thought 'poor thing' and removed all of the sticks, hoping it may become better and swim again. But it didn't and shrunk. However, it rejuvenated!"" Swimming with sharks, without a cage . It's less immortality and more regeneration, but Kubota believes these tiny marine animals could hold the secret to perpetual life. When an adult scarlet jellyfish -- or medusa -- is injured, it goes to the bottom of the ocean floor. From there, it morphs back into its infant state, known as a polyp. Then the polyp becomes a new medusa, allowing the jellyfish to move between an adult and infant state in about two months. Kubota has succeeded in making one jellyfish rejuvenate an incredible 12 times in the lab. But there remain many unanswered questions. ""There should be a key to rejuvenation in the system of scarlet jellyfish,"" says Kubota. ""I'd like to believe it could be applied to human beings, because genetically, jellyfish and humans are not so different.""

"(CNN) -- The massive protests in Hong Kong took an ugly turn on Friday when students pressing for representative democracy clashed with opponents, prompting a breakdown of talks aimed at defusing the crisis. This negativity followed a week of remarkably peaceful civil disobedience in what has been dubbed the ""Umbrella Revolution,"" after the widely shared image of a man defiantly holding up an umbrella in a haze of police tear gas fired to disperse the tens of thousands of activists crowding the city's main government and business thoroughfare, the region referred to as Central. But protesters shrugged off the gas assault as if it had never happened. Behind the barricades, they studied for exams, coordinated the cleanup and recycling of trash generated by the crowd, and jerry-rigged guerrilla charging stations for the voluminous array of devices the demonstrators are using as part of the sophisticated war they're waging on the virtual front, wielding the digital-age weapons of image feeds, live streaming video and ceaseless social media updates. The Umbrella Revolution is hardly the first protest to harness the power of technology to coordinate activities and broadcast messages, but it's almost certainly the most sophisticated. Andrew Lih, a journalism professor at American University, discussed the infrastructure the activists have adopted in an article for Quartz, a system that incorporates fast wireless broadband, multimedia smartphones, aerial drones and mobile video projectors, cobbled together by pro-democracy geektivists like the ad-hoc hacker coalition Code4HK. Given this remarkable show of force by the crowd under the Umbrella, it's not surprising that Beijing has moved quickly to prevent transmissions from reaching the mainland, blocking Chinese access to Instagram, where images and videos from the demonstrations and police crackdowns are regularly being posted, and banning all posts on popular messaging sites like Weibo and WeChat carrying keywords that refer to the protests. Activists have fought back by downloading the peer-to-peer ""mesh messaging"" app FireChat — which allows communication among nearby users even when centralized mobile services are unavailable by linking smartphones directly to one another via Bluetooth and wifi — in the hundreds of thousands, and by creating an elaborate system of numerical hashtags to stand in for forbidden terms. For example, #689 is the codename for Hong Kong chief executive C.Y. Leung, referring to the number of votes he received in his selection as the region's highest government representative, a scant majority of the 1,200 members of the the Communist Party-approved nominating committee. #8964 references Beijing's brutal June 4, 1989, crackdown on student democracy activists in Tiananmen Square, which casts a looming shadow over the Occupy Central demonstrations. These strategies seem to have prompted the Chinese authorities to resort to new and more insidious tactics. Links — seemingly posted by Code4HK — have begun popping up on social media, inviting users to download a new app that allows for secure coordination of protest activities. Instead, clicking the link downloads a Trojan horse that gives its developers — presumed by some security experts to be ""red hat' hackers working with support from the Chinese government — open access to the messages, calls, contacts, location and even the bank information and passwords of those naive enough to download it. That's a harsh lesson not just for those living under authoritarian regimes, but for us citizens of nominally free and democratic societies as well. The smartphone is by far the most formidable tool for populist empowerment ever invented, turning individual human beings into mobile broadcast platforms and decentralized mobs into self-organizing bodies. But it's also jarringly easy for these devices to be used against us. Here in the United States, revelations of the existence of massive government surveillance programs like the NSA's PRISM have caused an uproar among digital libertarians. Likewise, criminal smartphone hacking and cloud cracking has led to the release of celebrity nude photos and sex videos, to the humiliation of those who thought them private. The response from leading smartphone developers like Apple and Google has been to announce new methods of locking and encrypting information to make it harder for individuals, businesses or governments to gain access to our personal information. But even as they add these fresh layers of security, they continue to extend the reach of these devices into our lives, with services that integrate frictionless financial transactions and home systems management into our smartphones, and wearable accessories that capture and transmit our very heartbeats. Imagine how much control commercial exploiters, criminals — or overreaching law enforcement — might have if it gained access to all these features. The upshot is that we increasingly have to take matters into our own hands (and handsets), policing our online behavior and resisting the temptation to click on risky links. It may be worth exploring innovative new tools that offer unblockable or truly secure alternatives to traditional communications, like the free VPN browser extension Hola, which evades global digital boundaries to Web access; open-source projects like Serval and Commotion, which are attempting to develop standards for mesh connectivity that route around the need for commercial mobile phone networks; and apps like RedPhone and Signal, which offer free, worldwide end-to-end encrypted voice conversations. Most of these are works in progress. But as technology becomes ever more deeply embedded into our lifestyles, keeping our digital identities secure and private is becoming increasingly critical. And as the protests in Hong Kong have shown, the only solution may be to use technology to defend against technology — in other words, to fight fire with FireChat.","Students in the massive protests in Hong Kong want representative democracy .

"(CNN) -- T.J. Lane didn't belong to any particular clique in the schools he attended. Those who knew him described him as quiet, someone who was guarded and rarely spoke about his tumultuous family life. But they never would have thought that he'd turn out a killer -- walking up to a table in the cafeteria of Ohio's Chardon High School with a .22-caliber gun and pumping 10 rounds at students he picked randomly. Three students -- Demetrius Hewlin, 16; Daniel Parmertor, 16; and Russell King Jr., 17 -- died. That was on February 27, 2012, when he was a 17-year-old sophomore. Lane admitted his crime, didn't offer a reason, and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences at the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima. Three life sentences with no possibility of parole. On Friday, he was back in the news after he escaped from the facility, triggering an intense manhunt. He was captured about six hours later, enough time for him to reopen the wounds that his victims' families are trying to salve. ""There has certainly been an undeniable, profound and deep impact on our community,"" Michael Hanlon, Chardon school superintendent, said early Friday morning. Schools will remain closed but counselors and other support services will be provided. At school . Teresa Hunt's niece rode the school bus each day with Lane, and he displayed no warning signs of the violence to come. ""He was a really nice kid to her,"" Hunt told CNN after the shooting in 2012. ""He wouldn't start up a conversation, but if she talked to him, he would hold the conversation with her. She said her niece noted no personality changes in Lane in the weeks leading up to Monday's shooting. Haley Kovacik, a friend who talked with Lane a few times a week, said the violence left her and others who knew him in ""complete shock."" ""He seemed like a very normal, just teenage boy,"" Kovacik said of Lane. ""He did have a sad look in his eyes a lot of the time, but he talked normally, he never said anything strange."" Yet for all their talks, Kovacik noted there was a lot she didn't know about Lane. Friends, family remember Ohio school shooting victims . At home . Lane lived with his grandparents and was slow to open up about his personal life, according to friends. While he was known by many around Chardon High School, located 30 miles east of Cleveland, at the time of the shooting he was there to be transported to Lake Academy Alternative School in nearby Willoughby. The school describes itself as a place for ""at risk"" students who are ""reluctant learners"" struggling with problems such as ""substance abuse /chemical dependency, anger issues, mental health issues, truancy, delinquency, difficulties with attention/organization, and academic deficiencies."" Lane may have been dealing with his own family problems, according to reports by The Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland. Lane's father, Thomas Lane Jr., was arrested several times for violent crimes against female acquaintances, including Lane's mother, the newspaper reported citing court documents. Between 1995 and 1997, the first two years of Lane's life, his father and his mother were both arrested for domestic violence against each other, the paper reported. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and he also was charged with holding a different woman under running water and bashing her head into a wall, the newspaper reported. It was unclear how much contact Lane had with his father. He rarely opened up about his family, some said. ""I've asked him once or twice, but he never would go into detail. He just said he had family trouble,"" Kovacik said . Online . Posts on Lane's Facebook page show him sharing links to music videos. Yet one long, poetic rant, from December 30, 2011, appears to be darker. The post refers to ""a quaint lonely town, (where there) sits a man with a frown (who) longed for only one thing, the world to bow at his feet."" ""He was better than the rest, all those ones he detests, within their castles, so vain,"" he wrote. Lane then writes about going through ""the castle ... like an ominous breeze through the trees,"" past guards -- all leading up to the post's dramatic conclusion. ""Feel death, not just mocking you. Not just stalking you but inside of you,"" he writes. ""Wriggle and writhe. Feel smaller beneath my might. Seizure in the Pestilence that is my scythe. Die, all of you."" At his trial . At his sentencing, Lane's behavior shocked and outraged spectators. He unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal a white T-shirt on which he had scrawled the word ""KILLER"" across the front. He had on a similar shirt during his shooting rampage. Before the sentencing, he addressed the victims' families using profane imagery and ending with the expletive,""F--- all of you."" He then held up his middle finger. ""For everyone in that courtroom -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback,"" said Ian Friedman, who represented him at his trial, said late Thursday. Friedman, hasn't talked to Lane in about a year. At the proceeding, prosecutor James Flaiz said Lane never said why he carried out the attack. ""The only explanation I can offer the court is he is an evil person,"" Flaiz said. Ohio school shooter shows contempt, no remorse during sentencing . At the prison . In the 18 months Lane was housed at the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution, he was disciplined seven times, according to The Plain Dealer newspaper. The infractions ranged from urinating on a wall to giving himself a tattoo, the paper said. He also refused to carry out assignments, losing recreation time as punishment. Authorities said Lane scaled a fence and broke out of the facility, about 90 miles northwest of Columbus. He escaped, along with two other men, about 7:40 p.m. Thursday. All three have been captured. When police took him into custody, Lane didn't offer an explanation. T.J. Lane back in custody after prison escape .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration is launching a big new offensive: Combating sexual assault on college campuses. On Friday, the White House launched ""It's On Us,"" a campaign aimed at tackling the problem plaguing universities across the country. The movement, developed from recommendations issued by a White House-ordered task force in April, will seek to raise awareness and educate college students about the issue and what can be done to prevent it. A top priority . ""It's On Us"" is a next step in a series taken by the Obama administration to address the problem of sexual assault at colleges. In April, the task force released a 20-page report that highlighted what it described as the four most pressing problems in this area: . • Identifying the problem on campuses; . • Engaging men in prevention measures; . • Effectively responding to assault where it's reported; and . • Increasing transparency in the federal government's effort to enforce laws and respond to sexual assault cases. The new campaign will focus on tackling those issues by expanding student-led efforts at individual colleges and partnering with associations including the NCAA and athletic conferences such as the Big Ten, and large companies, including Viacom, which will promote the campaign on MTV, VH1 and BET. Over 200 colleges have signed on to participate in the campaign, including Dartmouth, the University of Michigan and Bates College. ""This is on all of us, every one of us, to fight campus sexual assault,"" President Obama said Friday. ""We are going to organize campus by campus, city by city, state by state; this entire country is going to make sure that we understand what this is about and that we're going to put a stop to it."" Senior administration officials told reporters in a conference call ahead of Friday's unveiling that ending sexual assault has been a top priority throughout Obama's presidency. ""Since the very beginning of the administration, the President and vice president have made it a top priority to end sexual assault. Today, one in five women is sexually assaulted while in college,"" senior Obama officials told reporters on a conference call. ""Most often, it happens to her during (the victim's) freshman or sophomore year by someone she knows. And also most often, she doesn't report what happened."" The one-in-five statistic is often cited by the White House when discussing this issue. It is derived from two studies conducted in 2007 and 2009. Many sexual assault instances go unreported, so it is difficult to get a complete count of instances. Reference to the NFL scandal . Though neither Obama nor Vice President Biden mentioned recent revelations of domestic abuse by several NFL players, both made allusions, with Obama calling on athletic associations, among others, to step up their efforts and set a better example. Biden said that the campaign will be a success when every man understands that domestic violence is never acceptable. ""As far as we've come, the fact is that from sports leagues, to pop culture, to politics, our society still does not sufficiently value women. We still don't condemn sexual assault as loudly as we should. We make excuses. We look the other way,"" Obama said. ""The mark of success will be that not a single woman in America blames herself and when every man in America understands ... there is no circumstance at all under, other than self-defense, when he has the right to raise a hand to a woman. None. Zero,"" Biden said. Obama administration officials didn't say whether the President or vice president would address the NFL scandals at the campaign's launch. They stressed that the focus of the movement was ""primarily on college students as opposed to professional athletes"" but said the NFL needs to ""get a handle"" on the problem and adopt a ""zero tolerance"" policy, since younger players tend to look up to professional athletes. ""The nexus to our campaign is an important one, too, in that many of these professional athletes are marketed as role models to young people,"" one official said. ""So their behavior does have the potential to influence these young people."" ""So that's one of the many reasons it's important the league gets a handle on this and have zero tolerance: Because many, many young people who are playing sports in high school or in colleges are looking up to these men as role models. And that behavior is not something we'd want them to replicate."" Engaging men . A key component of ""It's On Us"" will be to engage college-age men in the prevention process, White House officials told reporters. ""While we're going to seek to raise awareness with everyone and encourage everyone to get involved, there's also going to be a special focus on reaching and engaging men,"" a senior administration official said. That is ""based on the social norms research that tells us that young men often overestimate other men's acceptance of violence."" ""Most men in fact are not comfortable with violence against women, but they don't speak out because they believe that other men accept this behavior. By getting men involved, we think we can interrupt that way of thinking,"" they said. Biden made a blunt appeal to men in his remarks Friday. ""So to the guys out there who are watching this on television: Step up,"" he said. Officials stressed, though, that above all else, the campaign aims to be ""inclusive,"" reaching everyone on a college campus, from students to faculty to top administrators. Bringing in the celebrities . In addition to partnering with universities, associations, private companies and others, the administration launched a website and an anti-sexual assault public service announcement featuring Obama and Biden, plus several celebrities, including Jon Hamm, Joel McHale and Kerry Washington.","NEW: President: ""This is on all of us, every one of us, to fight campus sexual assault""

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) -- Can you do business well by doing good? ""Yes,"" says Christian Stadil, owner of Denmark based Thornico Group -- a group of more than 100 companies spanning food, technology, shipping, sports fashion, real estate and financing -- and author of the Danish book ""Company Karma."" ""I usually say Company Karma is CSR 3.0 on steroids,"" he says. ""We have to think in a way that unites long-term business strategy with a concern for the world we are living in. Every action we take has a consequence."" Although businesses have talked of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for years, some are taking it a new level, which they are calling CSR 3.0. It goes beyond the often basic image-building of traditional CSR and aims to create real, sustainable value for everyone, while holding the business accountable. Stadil is among a small group of corporate pioneers, molding his business to make a difference -- while still making a profit. And, according to a number of leaders and management experts, Company Karma -- or Corporate Social Responsibility 3.0 -- is the way of the future. ""Companies are no longer making as much money as they possibly can at any means,"" says Kellie McElhaney, founding director of the Center for Responsible Business at Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley. ""It is now squarely about how companies make their money and how is it contributing to sustainability."" Stadil's companies are grounded in what he calls the ""four-time win"" -- a goal to create value not just for the company, employees, partners and customers -- but also for the world. The change involves everything from running ""CSR Karma"" and charity projects around the world, to making offices more sustainable and energy efficient, and working with governments to create change. As an example, Stadil and the city of Rotterdam are completing Europe's largest ""green wall"" of climbing plants in a car park in Rotterdam in an effort to improve the local environment. Ultimately, he says the change must run all the way through the value chain; from production to processing, from suppliers to employee fulfillment in the workplace, and so on. ""It's a difficult change but we are making our way,"" he says. See also: How to inspire others . An innovator and leading thinker in business management, Stadil and his team are famous for turning faltering sports label Hummel into a global brand worn by stars like Jennifer Lopez, Jon Bon Jovi, Pink and Paris Hilton. Hummel's ""Change the World through Sports"" project has sponsored football teams and matches in Sierra Leone between former child soldiers, and between women in Kabul. ""In Afghanistan, girls could be killed for playing soccer,"" Stadil says, ""Imagine girls playing soccer in a stadium where the Taliban used to execute people."" Making a difference is more than worthwhile, he says, but it should also pay off. ""I refuse to acknowledge making money as the only thing of value, but just like a body needs blood to function, a company needs money to function,"" says Stadil. ""The question is, what does it do with the money? We expand, but we also give back. Companies need to gain value from making a difference, whether that is economically, socially, innovatively or from positive marketing."" McElhaney, who is also author of the book ""Just Good Business,"" agrees. ""Sustainability should be treated as a business strategy that can make a profit for the company, otherwise it will not last,"" she says. ""It's not easy stuff, but it should be seen as a need to do, not a nice to do."" Both agree that successful CSR should be rooted in the core competencies of the company. ""Do it smartly and strategically with good CSR strategy,"" says McElhaney. ""Bad CSR is KFC handing out pink buckets of chicken with the Susan Komen breast cancer foundation."" Another key is to make change sexy, says Stadil. ""At some point people get fed up hearing about green, so we have to think about how we can make these things cool. If consumers don't think it's cool, it won't work. Social engagement has to start from the bottom up."" ""The drive will come from enlightened leaders,"" says McElhaney. ""Look to companies like Patagonia and Levi's who are really doing it,"" she says, noting the world's largest retailer, Walmart, as another frontrunner credited with making significant changes to its supply chain. Outdoor-clothing company Patagonia's new Common Threads Initiative works with customers to repair, re-use, re-sell and recycle used Patagonia products. Over the past 20 years, the company says it has given more than $40 million to environmental causes and pioneered the use of organic cotton and fleece from recycled soda bottles. ""We are only scratching at the heels of guys like Patagonia,"" Stadil says, ""but this kind of change is an ongoing process."" To him, Company Karma is also an important consideration in attracting the talent of tomorrow. ""The new Y generation wants to be proud of the product and the company they work for,"" he says. ""They have turned Maslow's pyramid of needs around and see self-realization as the most important thing."" In addition to that, Stadil says the disappearance of traditional value and identity streams like family, rituals, tradition, and religion, is creating an opportunity for companies. ""All those things are losing influence, and we can provide some of that value and identity to our employees."" So, what does the future of Company Karma or CSR 3.0 look like? Young people are already there, says Stadil. ""A few days ago, I was a judge at Ben and Jerry's social entrepreneurship competition, 'Join Our Core,' and the innovative ideas young people have on social entrepreneurship and sustainability are amazing."" ""I am significantly confident that in my daughter's lifetime, 80% or more companies will do this,"" says McElhaney. ""It will be taken for granted.""","Businessman Christian Stadil believes companies must care about more than just money .

"(CNN) -- For those fascinated by the meticulous craft of watchmaking, there are few more important events than Baselworld -- the annual trade show for the international watch and jewelry industry in the Swiss border city of Basel. Culminating April 3, everyone from giant heritage brands to young horologist upstarts will submit their latest wares to the critical gaze of 150,000 experts and enthusiasts from around the globe. But for the average consumer, investing in a quality watch can still be a daunting and surprisingly complicated business. There are a raft of considerations to balance before committing to a luxury timepiece, and so we spoke to three leading industry insiders on how to make an informed decision. Classic stays in style . Toby Bateman, the buying director at fashion retail site MRPORTER.COM, says first-time buyers should avoid anything too outrÃ©. ""Keep it simple and timeless with classic design, something that would look good with a suit or your weekend clothes,"" he says. ""If you follow this advice then you are unlikely to see your watch 'go out of fashion."" Size matters . Ariel Adams, the founder and editor-in-chief of aBlogtoWatch.com, the world's most popular watch blog, follows two simple rules. Watches should not look petite on the wrist, and the lugs should not extend past the edge of the wrist. ""Most people look best with a round case, and a watch sized between 40-44mm wide looks good on the wrists of 95% of men,"" he says. There are few exceptions to this rule. As Batemen says: ""Avoid going too oversized unless you happen to be 6 foot 5' and it's in proportion to your gigantic wrists."" Read more: Death before dishevelment: Enter into Congo's cult of elegance . Iconic brands make for a good first splurge . ""It is often safe to go with a well-known brand with a lot of history,"" says Adams. ""The longer a brand has been making watches the better the results in many instances."" There are at least 20 very reliable brands with a proven track record for quality. Given their popularity, they often prove easier to repair and service as the years tick by. Don't think of your watch as a financial investment . ""You'll never get the money back that you spent on it,"" says Andrew Block, the president and CEO of leading luxury watch consultancy Second Time Partners. ""It's like buying a car. The minute you put it on your wrist it's worth less than what you paid for it."" If maintaining the value of a watch is still important to you, he says Patek Philippe and Rolex will fare the best. For women, he suggests Cartier. Off-the-radar brands are worth a look . There are literally thousands of brands to choose from, so do your research. Bateman suggests those graduating to luxury consider Bremont, a British brand which takes inspiration from the military, and Nomos Glashutte, an established brand in Germany that is making a push internationally. Bling doesn't always justify price increases . The number one expense in watch-making is labor. It's not the materials, and it's not diamonds and gold. ""Some watches are more branding than substance,"" says Adams. ""Watch out for brands with bloated prices thanks to merely adding precious metals and jewels to base watches and movements that aren't worth very much."" Don't fear the funky or avant-garde . Over time, buyers should feel comfortable adding new designs to their collection. From fashion watches to sports watches, every timepiece can up your style quotient, says Block. ""I believe in watch wardrobing,"" he says. ""You wear one watch today and one watch tomorrow. You can have a different watch for every occasion. It's a concept women already understand, and which men should embrace."" Choose it yourself . A watch may not be a financial investment, but it is an emotional one. It reflects something about the person who chooses it. Because of that, it's unwise to let a relative or friend select the watch that you'll be wearing for the next five to ten years. This is an opportunity to express something about yourself. Trust your instincts . ""People tend to doubt their own taste and try to buy what they think people want them to wear,"" says Adams. ""People should realize that their own taste is the most important and that legibility and wearing comfort are the two most important factors in allowing them to enjoy it the longest."" Read more: Beauty from the crypt: Mystery of Europe's jeweled skeletons . Technology can create problems . Added functions, such as a second time zone function, an annual calendar and a chronograph, can be useful. But if you don't know what these are, you should ask yourself if you really need them. ""Highly complicated mechanical watches add value but also fragility and potential service problems,"" Adams says. ""Those with very complicated timepieces are advised to have a few of them so that they have something else to wear if they need to be repaired."" Don't feel bad about rewarding yourself . Watches are practical purchases. Assuming you care for them, they can also last decades and become important markers of your personal history. ""A fine watch can signify an achievement, like branching out on your own, graduating university, or getting your first job,"" says Block. ""It can mark a new stage in your life.""

"(CNN) -- A freelance NBC cameraman with Ebola is ""reasonably stable"" a day after arriving at a Nebraska hospital, though a doctor there cautioned Tuesday it is much too early to say he'll make a swift and smooth recovery . Officials at The Nebraska Medical Center offered few details about Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo's condition and treatment, beyond saying that he was receiving an experimental drug known as brincidofovir, or CMX001. The fact they didn't sound any alarms isn't altogether surprising, given Mukpo was able to walk onto the plane that took him to the United States with assistance and his father, Dr. Mitchell Levy, told NBC News on Sunday that his son was feeling ""not that ill."" But Dr. Phil Smith, the medical director of the hospital's biocontainment unit, said Tuesday that the 33-year-old Mukpo still has a ways to go in his Ebola fight. ""With Ebola patients in general, sometimes they come in early and they don't look that sick, but later they develop complications with gastrointestinal issues, fluid loss, diarrhea, high fever and other complications, so it is early in the course,"" Smith said. ""So we will have to see how it goes."" That includes waiting to see what, if any effect brincidofovir has on Mukpo. Smith described this drug as "" an antiviral medication that has been used in a number of other infections."" Dr. Angela Hewlett, the Nebraska hospital's associate medical director, said this experimental medicine was chosen ""based on the Centers for Disease Control (and Prevention) and our assessment for other products that had been utilized for the treatment of Ebola."" ""We can't actually tell how he's responded yet,"" Hewlett added. ""It's too early to say."" The 33-year-old -- who had also worked for Al Jazeera and Vice News -- started presenting symptoms on October 1, about two weeks after arriving in the Ebola-wracked Liberian capital of Monrovia. A reporter asked Tuesday if Mukpo might have gotten the deadly virus while cleaning a car that he used to transport someone suffering with Ebola. Smith said that was possible, depending on a few factors including ""how sick the patient was in the car."" ""If they just had a fever than that's very different from a patient that was actively vomiting or having diarrhea or bleeding,"" Smith said. ""Contact with bodily fluids like that actually can transmit this disease."" Who are the American Ebola patients? Official: No one knew woman who infected Duncan had Ebola . Meanwhile, the lone person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States -- Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian citizen who arrived in Dallas on September 20 -- remains in critical condition at Dallas Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. His nephew, Josephus Weeks, pointed to a few positive developments including that Duncan's liver is ""doing very well,"" his blood pressure is like that of ""a normal person, his diarrhea ""has slowed"" and ""his fever is pretty much gone."" At the same time, the Rev. Jesse Jackson -- who is serving as a family spokesman -- noted that ""the infection around the liver and the lungs appear to be quite questionable at this stage."" ""We're not quite ready to say that (Thomas Eric Duncan has turned the corner), because the doctors would not say that,"" said Jackson. ""But the upbeat was that they gave us the three or four good news signs... I left hopeful."" The family continued to fight accusations that Duncan lied on a travel questionnaire about his exposure to Ebola prior to coming to the United States, thus putting many people at risk. Some in Liberia have claimed that he helped a woman who suffered from, and ultimately died, from Ebola but didn't admit to it. ""He helped a pregnant woman to get health care and she died, which was a noble thing to do,"" Jackson said, insisting that Duncan did not know the woman had Ebola. This story was backed up Tuesday by Pewu Wolobah, a member of the Ebola task force in the community where Duncan and the woman, Marthalene Williams, lived. According to Wolobah, at the time Duncan filled out that questionnaire and left Liberia on September 19 ""we had no evidence to suggest that (Williams) had died from Ebola."" ""It was only after, over the following days, those who'd come into contact with her started falling ill that we deduced she'd had Ebola,"" said Wolobah. ""We instated a quarantine on the community on (October 1) and are in the process of identifying all those who came in contact with Marthalene."" Wolobah added that ""so far we've identified over a 100 people"" who might have been infected by Williams. ""And that's just the beginning,"" he said. American with 'high-risk exposure' released, no symptoms . An American doctor who'd been hospitalized and isolated after a high-risk exposure to Ebola was released Tuesday with no symptoms of the deadly virus, officials said. He was admitted to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, last month for observation. The patient was volunteering at an Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone when ""a needle stick injury"" caused the scare, the National Institutes of Health said in a statement. ""The initial hospitalization was characterized by a brief period of fever that was subsequently determined to not be related to infection with Ebola virus,"" the statement said. The patient, who ""feels well and has no fever,"" will remain at home and check his temperature twice a day until the end of a 21-day observation period, the statement said. Doctors Without Borders staffer from Norway infected . A staff member for Doctors Without Borders, which is also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, has come down with Ebola, the non-profit agency announced Tuesday. The Norwegian national -- who was not named -- contracted the virus while working in the Sierra Leone city of Bo, according to Doctors Without Border. The staffer was put in isolation on Sunday and will be moved to Europe for treatment. Doctors Without Borders is one of several nonprofit agencies that have sent staffers and volunteers to West Africa, sometimes at great personal risk. Dr. Kent Brantly, for instance, was working for the nondenominational evangelical Christian international relief organization Samaritan's Purse when he contracted the virus in Monrovia in Liberia. Nancy Writebol, another American, was with the international missionary group Serving in Mission when she got the disease in the same place and at about the same time. Senator: Suspend most travel visas from Ebola-hit region . Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, on Tuesday called for the U.S. government to temporarily suspend most travel visas issued to those coming from the West African nations that have been ravaged most by Ebola. Writing to Secretary of State John Kerry, Nelson suggested that one way to prevent the virus from spreading into the United States would be to clamp down both on ""unnecessary travel to the United States under existing visas and the issuance of new visas for citizens of countries that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies as areas with high rates of infections."" Currently, Duncan is the only person to be diagnosed with the virus in the United States, though authorities have warned that number may grow. The administration of President Barack Obama, also a Democrat, has thus far refused to prevent people from coming into the United States from the Ebola-hit region. So have most other countries. Yet Nelson argued that policy should change, saying, ""Considering the changing events and overall magnitude of the situation, it may be time to reexamine the travel issue from the standpoint of visas."" Not everyone is embracing this plan, however. Jesse Jackson, for one, said Tuesday that taking such steps could hurt the economies of longtime American allies like Liberia. ""We should quarantine the disease, not quarantine nations and not quarantine airline flights,"" the civil rights leader said. ""We should not panic."" Nurses union poll: U.S. hospitals aren't prepared . For all the pronouncements that the United States is prepared to notice, control and combat Ebola, one major player in this fight appears to disagree: the nation's nurses. The United States' largest nurses union, National Nurses United, released a survey Tuesday in which 85% of respondents said that nurses haven't been able to interact or ask questions at their hospitals about Ebola. According to the same poll -- which includes responses from 1,600 registered nurses in 35 states -- more than three-quarters of the responding nurses said their hospitals haven't communicated to them any policy about what to do if an Ebola patient is admitted. Its not just about education and communication, but having the physical tools to deal with such highly contagious cases. Nearly 40% of the respondents, from more than 300 hospitals, believe their facilities don't have plans to properly equip so-called isolation rooms with things like plastic covered mattresses and pillows. One-third weighed in that their hospitals don't have enough protective gowns or eye-protection goggles or shields. ""Handing out a piece of paper with a link to the (CDC) or telling nurses just to look at the CDC website -- as we have heard some hospitals are doing -- is not preparedness,"" said nurse Bonnie Castillo, who heads the union's disaster relief program. ""Hospitals can and must do better, and we should have uniform national standards and readiness."" CNN's Nima Elbagir and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","NEW: Poll of U.S. nurses: Ebola education, supplies lacking in U.S. hospitals .

"(CNN) -- Buddy Cianci has been convicted twice, and twice he's been forced out as mayor of Providence, Rhode Island. But for him, this was a first. The 73-year-old Cianci lost a Providence mayor's race for the first time in seven runs on Tuesday, falling to political neophyte Jorge Elorza. ""It just didn't happen,"" Cianci said in his concession speech. ""But that doesn't mean that we don't have the heart and the spirit and the love for this city to say that we wouldn't do it again if we needed to."" Unofficial results, posted on Rhode Island's elections board website, showed Elorza winning 53% of the vote, with Cianci getting about 44% support. Had their roles been reversed, Cianci's swearing-in ceremony in January would have marked the fifth consecutive decade in which he has served as the city's mayor. Not all those terms, however, were continuous -- though they very well might have been had he not been forced to resign twice in disgrace. Cianci, a back-slapping machine politician reminiscent of a bygone era, served as the city's mayor from 1975 to 1984 and then again from 1991 to 2002, epochs recalled locally as Buddy I and Buddy II. Buddy I came crashing down after Cianci was convicted of using a fire log and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his wife. Buddy II ended after Cianci was convicted on federal corruption charges. At the end of Cianci's 2002 trial, the judge rebuked him before sentencing him to federal prison for five years. ""In this mayor's two administrations, there has been more corruption in the city of Providence than in the history of this state,"" said Judge Ernest Torres. But Cianci didn't shy away from his past on the campaign trail this year. He made both his records, mayoral and criminal, a centerpiece of his message in a race against a much younger and far less experienced opponent -- a race Cianci said was his ""final rodeo."" ""You're not going to get a Pulitzer Prize or an Emmy by saying 'Buddy Cianci is a convicted felon,'"" Cianci told CNN at his Providence headquarters recently. ""Everybody knows that."" But Elorza, his Democratic opponent, wasn't taking any chances. ""We have a storied history of corruption here in our city,"" he said at an October press conference. ""And those incidents of corruption are very well-documented in Mr. Cianci's administration."" In his concession speech, Cianci said that he and his campaign ""certainly were the recipients of some saturation bombing. And you know what, we are still alive."" He urged his supporters to offer help to Elorza, saying ""we need to bind together as a city."" As to his own future, Cianci remains a staple on local talk radio. And it's hard to totally count out someone who ran for -- and nearly won -- a job that he twice lost due to convictions. ""It's kind of a bittersweet night tonight because this will be my last campaign,"" he said. Following cries of ""No!"" from his supporters, Cianci promptly added, ""For this year.""","NEW: Buddy Cianci loses Providence mayoral race; says ""it just didn't happen""

"(CNN) -- ""I have a dream this afternoon that my four little children will not come up in the same young days that I came up within, but they will be judged on the basis of the content of their character, not the color of their skin."" The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke these words in 1963, but this was not the speech that would go down as one of the most important addresses in U.S. history. King spoke these words in Detroit, two months before he addressed a crowd of nearly 250,000 with his resounding ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the March on Washington for Freedom and Jobs on August 28, 1963. Several of King's staff members actually tried to discourage him from using the same ""I have a dream"" refrain again. 10 signposts on America's race journey . As we all know, that didn't happen. But how this pivotal speech was crafted is just one of several interesting facts about what is one of the most important moments in the 20th century in the United States: . MLK's speech almost didn't include ""I have a dream"" King had suggested the familiar ""Dream"" speech that he used in Detroit for his address at the march, but his adviser the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker called it ""hackneyed and trite."" So, the night before the march, King's staff crafted a new speech, ""Normalcy Never Again."" King was the last speaker to address the crowd in Washington that day. As he spoke, gospel singer Mahalia Jackson called out to King, ""Tell 'em about the dream, Martin."" Then he paused and said, ""I still have a dream."" Walker was out in the audience. ""I said, 'Oh, s---.'"" ""I thought it was a mistake to use that,"" Walker recalled. ""But how wrong I was. It had never been used on a world stage before."" The rest, of course, is history. First page of a draft of King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech (PDF) Handwritten text on back of ""I Have a Dream"" typed draft (PDF) The march almost didn't include any female speakers, either . It was only after pressure from Anna Arnold Hedgeman, the only woman on the national planning committee, that a ""Tribute to Negro Women Fighters for Freedom"" was added to the official program. It took further convincing to have a woman lead it. Daisy Bates spoke in the place of Myrlie Evers, the widow of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers. Bates, president of the Arkansas NAACP who played a key role in integrating schools in Little Rock, told the crowd: ""We will walk until we are free, until we can walk to any school and take our children to any school in the United States. And we will sit-on and we will kneel-in and we will lie-in if necessary until every Negro in America can vote. This we pledge to the women of America."" Earlier, Josephine Baker, an internationally known American entertainer who had moved to France to find fame, addressed the crowd. Dressed in a military jacket draped with medals for her contribution to French resistance in World War II, she spoke in very personal terms about freedom: . ""You know I have always taken the rocky path. I never took the easy one, but as I get older, and as I knew I had the power and the strength, I took that rocky path, and I tried to smooth it out a little. I wanted to make it easier for you. I want you to have a chance at what I had. But I do not want you to have to run away to get it."" Women had been central to the civil rights movement -- Diane Nash, Ella Baker, Dorothy Height and many others -- but were only included in the program that day after one woman spoke up. Opinion: Did we really learn the lesson of the March on Washington? The most prominent white speaker was called the ""white Martin Luther King"" Walter Reuther was the head of the United Automobile Workers, which provided office space, staff and funding for the march in Detroit and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He was the seventh speaker listed on the program, and shared his remarks to the crowd. ""We will not solve education or housing or public accommodations as long as millions of Negroes are treated as second-class economic citizens and denied jobs,"" he said. In 1998, Time Magazine included him in its list of Builders & Titans Of The 20th Century. Irving Bluestone, Reuther's former administrative assistant, shared this popular story to explain who Reuther was at the March on Washington: ""Standing close to the podium were two elderly women. As (Reuther) was introduced, one of the women was overheard asking her friend, 'Who is Walter Reuther?' The response: 'Walter Reuther? He's the white Martin Luther King.'"" An openly gay man organized the march in less than two months . Bayard Rustin is ""the most important leader of the civil rights movement you probably have never heard of,"" as LZ Granderson put it in his recent CNN column. Not only did he organize the march in a matter of months, Rustin is credited with teaching King about nonviolence. He also helped raise funds for the Montgomery bus boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Council. During the time, his sexual orientation was known, and he was often in the background to prevent it from being used against the movement. Fifty years after the march, Rustin, who died in 1987, will be honored with a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in November. It wasn't the first planned 'March on Washington' Labor leader and civil rights advocate A. Philip Randolph had threatened a ""March for Freedom"" on the National Mall in 1941 to pressure then-President Franklin Roosevelt to provide equal opportunity for defense jobs. Randolph hired Rustin to organize part of the march, which they felt was the only way to prompt action after numerous appeals. It worked: The march was called off after Roosevelt established the Fair Employment Practices Committee, abolishing racial discrimination in hiring. Opinion: We're closer to the American dream . The march was a Hollywood star-studded event . Popular actor and singer Harry Belafonte used his star power to help bring other celebrities to the March on Washington. Besides reaching out to the stars themselves, Belafonte went to many of the studio heads in Hollywood to get prominent actors and actresses temporarily released from their duties so they could participate. He was successful. The Hollywood list of attendees that day read like a who's who of A-listers: Marlon Brando, Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, Sammy Davis Jr., Charlton Heston and Burt Lancaster, who also gave a speech. But having the Hollywood stars there wasn't just for show or for increased media attention. It also helped calm President John F. Kennedy's nerves about the march. ""I believe that their presence did a lot to assuage people who were preoccupied with the fact there could be violence,"" Belafonte said. ""One of the things that I said in my conversations with the Kennedys in discussing why they should be more yielding in their support of our demonstration was the fact that there would be such a presence of highly profiled artists -- that that alone would put anxiety to rest,"" he added. ""People would be looking at the occasion in a far more festive way."" 5 faces of the March on Washington . One march worker fell asleep during MLK's speech . Back in 1963, college student Patricia Worthy took a job answering phones for the March on Washington's planning office. She had 10 phone lines to answer, and they rang from the time she walked in until she left for the day. ""I recall one day I'll never forget, I heard someone say, 'Where is this young lady who handles the phone?' And finally I looked up, and there he was -- Dr. King -- and he said, 'I want to meet this young lady. She has put me on the hold twice, and hung up on me once, and I want to know who she is.' "" Worthy said she was ""so embarrassed,"" but then the civil rights icon gave her a hug. By the day of the march, she was so tired, she dozed off and accidentally slept through the historic march and the ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Everything worked out for her in the end: Worthy had a successful legal career and now teaches law at Howard University. The only class MLK ever taught . Another hitchhiked all the way from Alabama only to have MLK check in on him . Robert Avery and two of his friends hitchhiked nearly 700 miles from Gadsden, Alabama, to Washington to participate in the march. Avery, who was 15 years old at the time, was no stranger to the dark side of the civil rights movement. A few months earlier, he was struck by a cattle prod wielded by Alabama police during anti-segregation demonstrations in Gadsden. The three youths arrived in the nation's capital a week before the march after three days of hitchhiking, and they were put to work making signs for the event. At one point, King walked in and asked for them. He had been in Gadsden the night before, and their parents had asked the civil rights leader to check on them. King sat down with the three and talked to them for about 20 minutes, asking them about their dreams, Avery later recalled. 'I Have a Dream' beat JFK's 'Ask not what you can do' speech . There's no doubt that King's speech was the most memorable part of the March on Washington. It's still taught in school, and memorized by children, half a century later. But how does it compare against other pivotal speeches by 20th century leaders, such as John F. Kennedy or Franklin D. Roosevelt? Well, a panel of more than 130 scholars got together in 1999 to rate the best speeches of the 20th century and King's speech ranked No. 1. What else have you learned about the march?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The lawsuit against Porsche related to the fiery crash that killed actor Paul Walker suffered a setback in court, but a lawyer says it will go on. Roger Rodas' widow is suing that carmaker's North American branch, claiming negligence and a poor design of the high-powered Porsche Carrera GT caused the crash last November. U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez dismissed four of the five grounds for the lawsuit, finding that the complaint did not include enough specifics. Rodas can revive the arguments by amending her lawsuit, Gutierrez said in an order filed in federal court Monday. ""He only granted a partial dismissal with leave to amend, which we will,"" Rodas lawyer Mark Geragos told CNN Tuesday. Kristine Rodas filed the suit against Porsche Cars North America in May, citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40-year-old ""Fast and the Furious"" star on November 30 in Santa Clarita, California. She also alleged product liability and wrongful death. The only allegation that was not dismissed was the ""strict liability claim"" regarding the lack of a crash cage and racing fuel cell for the high-performance car. The Rodas lawsuit contends that a ""properly functioning crash cage"" would have prevented the deaths by preventing ""intrusion into the passenger compartment,"" damage to the fuel tank, and the splitting of the vehicle in half. Read the judge's full decision here . Roger Rodas, 38 at the time of his death, spent his competitive racing career driving Porsche cars. According to the court documents, he and Walker first met on the race track when Rodas was driving a Porsche owned by the actor. A few years later the two men formed the racing team Always Evolving Racing, where they were both drivers. ""Although Mr. Rodas had a passion for cars, Mr. Rodas was first and foremost dedicated to his family, his wife, Kristine, and their two young children,"" the complaint states. The court documents filed by Kristine Rodas describe the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT that her husband was driving as a an ""ultra-high-performance-super-sports car for the road,"" that goes from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 205 miles per hour. The complaint argues that such a high-powered sports car should have a higher standard of crash protection, and that a mechanical malfunction forced Rodas to veer off the road. Geragos also hired investigators to evaluate wreckage at the scene, who determined that Rodas was driving 55 mph before the vehicle went out of control. This contradicts the Los Angeles County coroner's report that car was speeding at more than 100 mph, and the investigations by the Los Angeles County Sherriff's Office and California Highway Patrol that focused on speed. Porsche pointed to the discrepancy. ""As you know, the crash was subject of a very detailed investigation by the authorities, both the California Highway Patrol and the L.A. County Sheriff's Office,"" said Bernd Harling, Head of Public Relations for Porsche Cars North America. ""The reports showed that driving at a high speed in a negligent manner caused the crash. Both concluded that there was no mechanical defect of the vehicle involved."" ""Their investigation disproves in the allegations in the lawsuit,"" he said. CNN's Jane Caffrey and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","A federal judge dismissed most of the lawsuit claims, but it can be refiled .

"(CNN) -- Gone but not forgotten. Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, disappeared in October 2009. Her remains were found a few months later. Her death remains a mystery, but it's back in the news this week because of the arrest of Jesse Matthew -- the only known suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. Virginia State Police have not said how the two cases are connected, except to say there is a ""new forensic link."" They are pursing that link with the hope of being able to provide, finally, some sort of closure for the Harrington family -- whatever that may look like. ""There's a suspect, and possibility of a link to Morgan's murder, and I am so pleased that that has happened, but it doesn't change a lot for us, in some ways,"" Harrington's mother, Gil Harrington, told CNN affiliate WSLS on Monday. ""You know, our bedroom is still empty upstairs. We're still not going to have the grandchildren, the wedding, those things,"" she said. Can arrest in Hannah Graham disappearance solve other cases? The disappearance . Harrington disappeared on October 17, 2009, after attending a Metallica concert at the University of Virginia's John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia. She had been so excited about the concert, according to her mother, that she posted the tickets on the refrigerator about six months ahead of time. She tried on three outfits before settling on what to wear, a crystal necklace and a black T-shirt with the word ""Pantera"" spelled out in tan letters. Police say she left her friends to use the restroom during the concert. When she did not return, her friends called her cell phone. Harrington told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its re-entry policy but not to worry and that she would find a ride home. There are restroom inside the arena and, to this day, it's not clear why she left. Witnesses later saw someone matching Harrington's description walking along a nearby bridge. No further sightings were reported. Harrington's purse, along with her identification and cell phone, was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena. Her remains were discovered January 2010 on a nearby farm. Another link . On a website dedicated to Harrington, the education major is described as a ""true original."" ""Time is moving on so very quickly, but we are not. We are stuck in the limbo of not knowing, the purgatory of no answers, no justice. How can it be possible that 4 years! of investigation has not ferreted out your murderer (s?) We are determined to do just that, find him. Frantic actually, to find him before he kills again,"" it reads. Besides the connection to the Graham case, police have linked Harrington's death with the kidnapping and assault of another woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005. That woman, who survived the attack, was able to provide police with enough of a description to make a sketch. Authorities have not publicly identified the woman who gave the description but have said her case was connected to Harrington's case through DNA. If Matthew is linked to Harrington's death, and Harrington's death is linked to the kidnapping and rape of the woman in Fairfax, then is Matthew linked to the Fairfax case? So many questions. So few answers. But there's at least one thing Harrington's family knows -- and for which it is grateful. ""I know where Morgan is. However this unfolds, I know where my girl is. She's in a box in the living room,"" Harrington's mother told WSLS. ""Hannah Graham's family do not know where their daughter is,"" she said. ""We need to find her. The investigation needs to find her and, most of all, her family needs to find her.""

"(CNN) -- The man accused of setting a fire in an air traffic control center, causing the shutdown of operations at Chicago O'Hare International and nearby Midway Airport, sent a private Facebook message to a relative just before he started the blaze, the FBI says in an affidavit. ""Take a hard look in the mirror, I have,"" the message said, according to the affidavit. ""And this is why I am about to take out ZAU [the three-letter identification for the control center] and my life. ... So I'm gonna smoke this blunt and move on, take care everyone."" Then, 36-year-old Brian Howard apparently started the fire in the control center basement, the affidavit said. When firefighters arrived, they found him lying on the floor and slicing his throat with a knife, the affidavit said. The FBI charged Howard, a resident of Naperville, Illinois, with one count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, a felony. Howard was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries. The fire started at about 5:40 a.m. Friday and caused the evacuation of the air traffic control center in Aurora, Illinois, which controls flights in several Midwest states. Airlines at O'Hare canceled 1,550 flights and 470 at Midway, the Chicago Department of Aviation said at 8:45 p.m. Friday. Southwest Airlines suspended all fights for the day at Midway and Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport. The ripple effect caused the cancellation of flights at airports across the nation. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had 70 cancellations on Friday, compared to seven on Thursday, according to Flightaware, a flight-tracking website. LaGuardia Airport in New York City had 56 on Friday and 10 on Thursday. By Friday afternoon, flights to the Chicago airports had resumed at a ""reduced rate,"" authorities said. The effect of the fire on Saturday's flight activity has not been determined and it was not clear when the center would reopen. Faced transfer to Hawaii . Howard had worked eight years in the center but faced a transfer to Hawaii, the FBI says in an affidavit. The documents don't specify his job title but said he worked in ""telecommunications matters."" The FBI said Howard arrived at the control center a little after 5 a.m. dragging a ""hard-sided roller board suitcase"" into the basement, where he usually worked. He allegedly sent the Facebook message about 30 minutes after arriving and the recipient notified police. At 5:42 a.m. somebody in the control center called 911 about a fire, the affidavit said. First responders found smoke in the air, blood on the floor, exposed cables, burned towels, a gasoline can, a lighter and a knife on the floor, the affidavit said. One paramedic saw some feet sticking out from under a table and found a shirtless Howard ""in the process of actively slicing his throat with another knife,"" the affidavit said. Howard, the affidavit said, told the paramedics to ""leave me alone."" Police obtained search warrants for Howard's home and found ""legal documents that had been laid out in a staged manner, in an attempt to make them easier to find,"" the affidavit said. The affidavit didn't describe the documents. No court date has been set for Howard. If convicted, Howard faces a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $ 250,000. CNN affiliate WLS reported that Howard was a machinist mate in the Navy from 1996 to 2000 with nothing unusual about his military record. He had a few traffic citations in 2007, but nothing serious, WLS said. ""He seemed like an everyday, normal kind of guy to me,"" neighbor Colin McGrath told WLS. Travelers are frustrated . When the two Chicago airports shut down, controllers at other airports helped manage traffic to and from Chicago. O'Hare last year handled 883,000 takeoffs and landings, ranking it as the second-busiest airport on the planet, according to Airports Council International. Travelers stood in long lines inside the O'Hare terminal trying to rearrange flight plans. They described a frustrating scene to CNN reporters. ""There's chaos mixed with outrage,"" said Bernard Thompson of Washington, D.C., who needs to be home by Sunday for a speaking engagement. Thompson said that after his flight was canceled, the airline told him the next flight with an open seat would leave Monday. He booked a flight with another airline, only to discover the first airline couldn't locate his luggage. ""I'll get there but it's a question of whether I'll have my luggage with me,"" he said. The fire ruined travel plans at other airports. Des Moines International Airport reported 19 cancellations on Friday, according to Flightaware, including the flight that would have carried Chelsea and Bill Wright to New York City. ""We boarded our dogs and our kids are here and we got babysitters for them so it's messing everything up,"" Chelsea Wright told CNN affiliate KCCI. Other control centers pitch in to help . In a typical backup plan for a disabled FAA center, the FAA could assign air traffic control authority to FAA centers in other cities, such as Indianapolis, Cleveland, Minneapolis or Kansas City. Doug Church, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union, said air traffic controllers braced for a tough day. ""Indianapolis Center is one of the major facilities bearing the brunt of the extra workload today due to the Chicago Center situation,"" Church said. O'Hare is a main hub for United Airlines and other major carriers, with flights headed to international destinations. When controllers stop flights scheduled to fly to O'Hare, it has the potential to trigger a line of falling air traffic dominoes that will ruin travel plans for countless would-be passengers. Illustrating the point, the flight tracking website FlightRadar24.com showed no aircraft flying in an area stretching from eastern Iowa to central Michigan. Smoke at FAA facility stopped flights in May . Friday's flight stoppages come four months after smoke at an FAA radar facility in Elgin, Illinois, prompted flight cancellations and delays at O'Hare and Midway. In that May 13 incident, most flights in and out of O'Hare were delayed by an average of an hour or more, and more than 600 flights were canceled, the Chicago Department of Aviation said. Some 75 flights were canceled at Midway. The smoke in that May incident was caused by a faulty motor in an air conditioning system, the FAA said at the time.

"(CNN) -- Macmillan Publishing has decided to do ""A Little Something Different"" by crowd-sourcing and letting readers pick some of the books it will publish. The publisher's aptly titled Swoon Reads imprint targets readers in the market for a good young adult romance. Fans of young adult fiction are a passionate community and they know what they like. Jean Feiwel, a veteran of children's publishing known for her work with popular series like ""The Baby-Sitter's Club"" and ""Goosebumps,"" was eager to find a new way to hear what readers want. After witnessing the success of self-published authors like Colleen Hoover and Abbi Glines, Feiwel realized that much of the talent being surfaced by readers wasn't reaching her or other publishers through agents. She wanted to establish a direct way for readers and writers to connect with Macmillan and fill the gap. Two years ago, she put out a call for Macmillan employees to attend a lunch meeting about how Macmillan could find these teen romance stories. Soon, the book version of ""American Idol"" was born, built by volunteers within the company who had a passion for young adult fiction. The Swoon Reads site launched in September 2013. Unpublished writers submitted their manuscripts and users read and voted on their favorite stories, using comments and a Swoon index measuring the emotions the stories triggered. Out of the reader favorites, Swoon Read's team of editors would award publishing contracts to a few writers each season. Feiwel's goal is six books a year from Swoon, selected from the voting pool for spring/summer, fall and winter. While Swoon Reads is focused only on romantic young adult fiction, Macmillan Children's Publishing Group President Jon Yaged believes the crowd-sourcing model could work for other genres like sci-fi, mystery and romance -- anything with a ""rabid reader base that is engaged and eager to share their opinions."" The first book published was Sandy Hall's ""A Little Something Different"" in August. Hall, a librarian who specializes in books for teens, saw Feiwel talking about Swoon and its quest for fresh manuscripts in an interview. As a librarian, Hall had a good idea of what teens were looking for and not finding. One student expressed a desire to read about two characters with parallel lives who can't seem to meet. Hall wondered what the familiar trope might look like if told from multiple perspectives of people who witness the two characters' missed connections. After a couple of weeks of planning, Hall wrote the story in six days and submitted it to Swoon in November 2013. ""I don't think I'll ever have that kind of magic again,"" she said. Hall started seeing feedback soon after posting the story and she became obsessed with checking the comments and ranking. ""There is something to be said about constructive criticism from strangers, because they aren't worried about ending the friendship,"" Hall said. ""And what's great about Swoon is when a story starts to gain traction, the whole community takes notice."" On a snowy day in February, Hall found out she had been awarded a publishing contract. Feiwel said that Hall's story connected with Swoon readers and the editorial staff because of its quirky points of view and refreshing lightness. Hall and other Swoon writers have formed a debut author support group, sharing advice, asking questions and exchanging laughs over email and social media. The group will continue to grow as Swoon publishes more writers. It's exactly the kind of community Feiwel envisioned for Swoon. ""Writers who are new to writing can get a nurturing community, so that they learn how to write and they are benefiting from being on the site whether they get published or not,"" Feiwel said. ""People are commenting on their work in a constructive way and helping them."" Feiwel and her team post writing advice on the Swoon blog to mentor and encourage users on the art of crafting stories. They also want to ""pull back the curtain"" on the publishing industry for writers. Swoon Reads has hired Lauren Scobell, former consumer marketing director at Nickelodeon, as its director. This enables Feiwel to focus on her imprint, Feiwel and Friends, as well as think more creatively about opportunities for Swoon. In this venture, the publishing industry is learning, too. ""When we go to edit the books that we've chosen, we gather the reader comments and many times they say things that we haven't thought of,"" Feiwel said. ""They're choosing book covers we wouldn't have chosen. We are really cultivating a community of writers and readers and we're grateful to the readers -- they're doing a lot of the commenting, a lot of the work and expanding the definition of what we know appeals to people.""","Swoon Reads lets readers vote on the books they want published .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- People sift through debris in the dark, wading through murky puddles formed after frequent, heavy rain showers. Along some streets, groups sit among the stinking piles of wreckage, huddled around small fires cooking food. This is life in Tacloban. Or, more accurately, people's attempts to hold onto life. So much has changed over the past six days in this Philippine city on the Pacific Ocean, some 575 kilometers (360 miles) southeast of Manila. That's when, early last Friday, Super Typhoon Haiyan stormed through with sustained winds of 315 kph (195 mph), and gusts of 380 kph (235 mph). Aid, troops head to Philippines, but will it be enough? The evidence of Haiyan's power is everywhere: Most buildings are damaged, if not destroyed. Bloated corpses of dogs lie on the ground, next to body bags containing human remains. While the intensity surprised some, most residents knew something big was coming. May May Gula, 30, was among those who'd heeded officials' warnings and taken shelter at the Tacloban Convention Center. She and some others managed to get to the building's higher levels when the devastating storm surge roared in from the sea. That last move may have saved their lives. Many who remained on the ground floor were killed or injured, according to Gula and her friend Lina Reforzado. By Thursday, Gula and her relatives huddled in a room on the building's ground floor along with members of seven other families. Their homes destroyed, they and others have transformed the building into a living space of sorts. Clothes hang from the upper floors, and makeshift shelters constructed from storm debris have sprung up around it. Man's desperate search for wife, child in Philippines . Finally on Thursday, they tasted rice -- the staple of Filipinos' diets -- for the first time in a week, after it was given out at the convention center for the first time since the typhoon struck. But they said they didn't know when the next delivery might come. Nor do they know what they'll do, or where they'll go from here. Said Gula: ""We really don't know what we're going to do next."" There are flickers of ""normal"" life around Tacloban. A pig shrieking as it's being pushed into a building for slaughter. An animal carcass butchered in front of another structure. A few vendors selling pork. But for most, food remains desperately scarce. At the airport, you see large groups hoping to leave this shattered city. A queue of people, taking shelter from the fierce sun and intermittent rain under colorful umbrellas, snakes out of the remnants of the terminal building and into the wreckage-laden parking area. Some seem particularly in need of a quick exit. One man stands holding an intravenous drip for his wife, who sits on a chair clutching a pallid young child. No one knows whether they'll make it out before it's too late. How to help . CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Tacloban, Philippines, was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan .

"(CNN) -- An estimated 40,000 people in the United States are involved in professional dogfighting, an illegal blood sport with fight purses as high as $100,000. The latest accusations against Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick and three other people highlight the problem. They are accused in an indictment that describes dogs being routinely executed if they didn't fight fiercely. The indictment was handed down Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Richmond, Virginia. The nightmare of dogfighting is growing, according to the Humane Society of the United States. John Goodwin, an expert on animal fighting with the Humane Society, says there are an estimated 40,000 professional dogfighters in the United States, involved in putting on fights and buying and selling fighting dogs.   Watch what goes on at a high-stakes dog fight » . But, Goodwin adds, there could be as many as 100,000 additional people involved in ""streetfighting"" -- informal dogfighting, often involving young people in gangs. ""It's far more pervasive than people think and it's definitely been on the upswing in the past five to 10 years,"" he told CNN.  See how dogfighters operate and have their own language » . Statistics from animal shelters give another indicator of the rise in dogfighting, Goodwin said.  Fifteen years ago, 2 to 3 percent of the dogs coming into animal shelters were pit bulls; now, he said, pit bulls make up about a third. At one shelter in Jersey City, New Jersey, Goodwin said, the figure is 65 percent, with 20 percent of them showing the scars that indicate they have been fighting dogs. A database run by animal advocacy group Pet-abuse.com, which collects reports of animal abuse, shows reports of dogfighting cases increased from 16 in 2000 to 127 in 2006. The group has found 74 cases reported so far this year. Dogfighting is illegal in all 50 states. It's a misdemeanor in Idaho and Wyoming, and a felony everywhere else. But in some states where dogfighting is a felony, it's still perfectly legal to own a fighting dog or be a spectator at a dogfight.  See where it's legal to be a spectator » . A bill signed by President Bush in May made the federal law against dogfighting tougher, by strengthening penalties to felony level. The law bans interstate commerce, import and export related to animal fighting activities. Violators can now be sentenced to three years in jail and a $250,000 fine. Previously the maximum sentence was a year in jail. Despite the laws, dogfighting is big business.  Goodwin said it's impossible to estimate the amount of money involved, but the purse for a top-level professional fight could be $100,000. ""There are about a dozen underground dogfighting magazines, and about half a dozen ... registries that are exclusively used by either dogfighters or people that are fighting dog enthusiasts,"" Goodwin said.

"(CNN) -- One of the most secretive countries in the world seems to be putting a succession plan into place: North Korean leader Kim Jong Il promoted his youngest son to general. Experts say that could be an indication that Kim Jong Un will succeed his father and his grandfather as leader of North Korea. The outside world knows very little about Kim -- not even his age, which is apparently 27 or 28. But at least one person outside the reclusive communist state once considered Kim Jong Un his best friend. Or at least he thinks so. Joao Micaelo went to school in Switzerland with a boy he knew as Pak Un from 1998 to 2001. A teacher put them together at the same desk when the new student arrived, and they hit it off. Then, one day Pak Un told Micaelo, ""I am the son of the leader of North Korea."" Micaelo ""didn't believe him because ... it was a normal school,"" he told CNN Tuesday. ""Normally the children of people like this, they don't go to a normal school."" But having seen pictures of the apparent heir to Kim Jong Il, Micaelo thinks it's his high school friend. He remembered what his friend had told him years before. ""Then I said, ""Okay, maybe it's true what he said to me,' "" said Micaelo, who now lives in Bern, Switzerland, near the school he attended. Local government officials in the town that's home to the Liebefeld School confirmed a student named Pak Un attended at the same time as Micaelo. The school declined to speak to CNN. Micaelo remembers ""Pak Un"" being introduced as the son of the ambassador of North Korea. What is life like inside North Korea? ""He was a normal guy like me,"" Micaelo said, interested in sports, movies and computers. ""He was competitive at sports. He didn't like to lose, like any of us. For him, basketball was everything,"" Micaelo said . ""He played basketball, he had basketball games on his Playstation. The whole world for him was just basketball all the time,"" he said. The North Korean, who spoke good enough German to be understood, was not outgoing, Micaelo said. ""He was very quiet and he didn't speak with anyone. Maybe it was because most of the people did not take the time to understand him,"" he said. ""And he was not that type of guy who goes to another and says, 'Hello, how are you?' He was always quiet."" He didn't go out at night to parties or discos, but he and Micaelo sometimes talked about girls, his friend said. Micaelo went to his house many times, meeting people whom he thought were his friend's parents. But they spoke English, not German, and because Micaelo didn't speak English well at the time, he didn't get to know them very well. But they struck him as ""a normal family, like my family."" ""Pak Un"" didn't talk much about North Korea, Micaelo said. He hasn't seen his friend in years, since the North Korean moved home to go to a private school. But he'd like to see him again -- particularly if it didn't mean going to North Korea. Is there political change in the wind in North Korea? ""I would like to speak with him to remember old times, you know,"" Micaelo said. ""Because you know for me, he was also an important friend. He was my best friend at the time. I would like to see him again."" But, Micaelo said, he's not sure if now is the right time. ""Just now I don't know if it's good to see him again. ... If he asked me to go visit him. I don't know if I go or not,"" he said. Micaelo said he doesn't know what to expect from Kim as a leader. To read more on North Korea, go to CNN's special coverage . ""I can just say what I know: Un, when he was 16, he was a good guy,"" Micaelo said. ""So, I don't think he would do something bad. But I don't know what he's been like in the last nine years. ""I just knew him when he was 16 years old. He's been in a special school for this for nine years,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Kansas church notorious for its angry, anti-gay protests at military funerals will continue the controversial practice despite new restrictions in a bill passed by Congress that awaits President Barack Obama's signature. ""That's really not going to change our plans at all,"" Westboro Baptist Church spokesman Steve Drain told CNN on Friday. ""We're going to continue to do that. We're also going to continue to obey all laws."" The next planned protest is at a military funeral Saturday in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Drain said: ""We'll be out there, doing our thing."" Under provisions of a comprehensive veterans affairs bill that won final congressional approval Tuesday, protesters must be at least 300 feet from military funerals from two hours before they start until two hours after they end. Violators could face unspecified fines and up to two years in prison. ""Protests that encroach upon the funerals and burials of our fallen soldiers are repugnant and inappropriate -- and they undermine the respect military families and loved ones undeniably deserve,"" said a statement by retiring Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who sponsored the provisions. Snowe, who has complained about the partisan divide in Washington, expressed gratitude to Congress for passing the bill ""to protect the solemn moments of military funerals from outside disruption."" The Westboro church, led by pastor Fred Phelps, believes God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality"" through events including soldiers' deaths. Members have traveled the country to protest at military funerals and other events, evoking outrage by shouting at grieving families and displaying such signs as ""Thank God for dead soldiers,"" ""God blew up the troops"" and ""AIDS cures fags."" ""The Lord has just granted us another round of preaching opportunity here,"" Drain said, accusing Congress of enabling homosexuality with its attempt to ""keep Bible preaching away from funerals."" Funerals are one of the few events where ""people will take a really serious look at really moral matters of heaven and hell,"" Drain said. The purpose of the church's protests was to influence the people attending the funerals, he added. ""If you flip off God, if you disobey the standards of God, you will incur God's wrath,"" he said. ""What we're trying to do is get people to wake up and smell the coffee."" The new restrictions expand on provisions in a federal law passed in 2006 that banned protests within 300 feet of national cemeteries from an hour before a funeral to an hour after it, with violators facing fines and up to a year in prison. Last year, the Topeka, Kansas, church won an appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court in a case that tested the competing constitutional rights of free speech and privacy. The case involved a protest by Westboro members outside the 2006 funeral for Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder in Westminster, Maryland, near Baltimore. Snyder's family sued the church in 2007, alleging invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. A jury awarded the family $2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $8 million in punitive damages, which were later reduced to $5 million. The church appealed the case in 2008 to a federal appeals court, which reversed the judgments a year later, siding with the church's allegations that its First Amendment rights were violated. The case then went to the Supreme Court, which issued a narrow ruling based on the facts of the specific appeal. By an 8-1 vote, the high court said members of Westboro Baptist Church had a right to promote what they call a broad-based message on public matters such as wars. A majority of states across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the Westboro church protesters. In addition, counter-protesters including bikers and even people dressed as zombies have turned out at some Westboro church demonstrations. Drain said a legal challenge to the new restrictions was possible. ""We're keeping our options open,"" he said. ""Any law that unnecessarily restricts our freedom of religious expression is always going to be open to challenge."" He added: ""That's all we care about here. We've got to preach."" Church members say they believe U.S. soldiers deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality. The congregation is made up mostly of Phelps and his family. The pastor has 13 children, at least 54 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He described himself as an ""old-time"" gospel preacher in a CNN interview in 2006, saying, ""You can't preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God."" Drain said the freedom of expression fight waged by the church benefited all of society, including the news media. ""It's in everybody's best interest, including yours, that those sidewalks remain a platform, a forum for open and robust debate,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- What really makes a business tick and retain a healthy balance sheet? It's all about keeping it in the family, according to a large chunk of small-to-medium size businesses which dominate the marketplace in Germany. While the name Germany conjures up large-scale brands such as Volkswagen, BMW and Siemens, it's the smaller, family-owned businesses which are the backbone of Germany's economy. One prime example is prosthetics specialist Ottobock -- the market leader for artificial limbs. A company you've probably never heard of, it makes 60% of prosthetic limbs globally and has annual revenues over a billion dollars. It attributes its 95-year success to its family-run persona. Family ties . Behind the scenes Ottobock looks like any other medium-size German company, or ""mittelstand"". A family-managed company since its founding in 1919, Ottobock's headquarters are in Duderstadt, but the firm has subsidiaries in fifty countries worldwide and employs over 8,000 people. Ottobock has provided athletes such as German Paralympic sprint gold medalist Heinrich Popow with an artificial limb. The ""Genium"" prosthetic leg works with a microchip that has allowed Popov to move in ways that were not possible a few years ago. ""It can tell you all the forces that are happening in the knee. It can tell you the amount of weight that it is putting on and this is what makes it an intelligent knee,"" says Drikus Reinicke, an orthopedic technician for Ottobock. Gold medalist Popov says the technology has vastly improved his quality of life: ""When you walk through the city, you can walk with your head up,"" he says. The CEO of Ottobock, Hans Georg Näder, says one of the keys to the company's success has been continued family ownership. ""It took almost a hundred years and it took a lot of innovation,"" he says. Founded in 1919 by Nader's grandfather, innovation and technology were always the key drivers of the company, adds Näder. Global outlook . Some 60% of Germany's total workforce are employed in small-to-medium size businesses. Innovation, quality and a global outlook are three key reasons such German companies have flourished. Germany has been ""very successful in global competition,"" said Dr. Olaf Plötner, professor and Dean of the European School of Management and Technology. From an export perspective, ""70% is done by mid-size companies,"" he said. ""This is also why some would call them hidden champions."" More well-known brands in this medium-size category include appliance maker Miele and cleaning equipment maker Karcher. But for less recognized names such as Ottobock, growing globally is what is taking German companies to the next level. Taking Ottobock ""into the future"" is the goal, says Näder. A big challenge, ""but without challenges, no fun,"" he adds.","Germany has a record of successful family-run businesses going global .
Ottobock, now in its 95th year, operates in 50 countries .

""Some of the awards rested on impermissible legal theories,"" U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh wrote in her ruling. The jury had awarded Apple more than $1 billion in damages total after finding Samsung had copied both the design and software features of the iPhone. The new ""trial on damages"" affects the formula, and thus the amount, that Samsung must pay to Apple. It will focus on several Samsung products specifically, after Koh questioned the damages ordered because of them. They are the Galaxy Prevail, Gem, Indulge, Infuse 4G, Galaxy SII AT&T, Captivate, Continuum, Droid Charge, Epic 4G, Exhibit 4G, Galaxy Tab, Nexus S 4G, Replenish and Transform. Apple vs. Samsung: A peace treaty . Just under $600 million of the earlier award to Apple involving other Samsung products still stands, according to Koh. Samsung, which recently logged record-breaking sales of its latest Galaxy phone, is locked in a tight race with Apple to see who will dominate the U.S. smartphone market. That rivalry has spilled out into court on multiple occasions. Last summer, a South Korean court found that both parties had infringed on each other's patents, banning the sale of the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, two iPad models and Samsung's Galaxy S2. Yet the damages ordered in that case paled compared to those at stake when the two tech giants faced off last year in a U.S. federal court in Northern California. Apple accused Samsung of copying the design of the iPhone and iPad, suing Samsung for $2.5 billion. Samsung countersued Apple for $519 million, also for patent infringement. Patent battle continues . After sifting through 109 pages of jury instructions and their notes and memories from weeks of testimony, a nine-person jury found Samsung was guilty of ""willful"" violations of a number of Apple's patents and recommended that Apple get more than $1 billion in compensation. The jury did not recommend awarding Samsung any money in its counterclaims. ""This is a huge win for Apple,"" Mark Lemley, a Stanford law professor, said then. The award ""is just large enough to make it the largest surviving patent verdict in history."" In December, Judge Koh issued a ruling denying Samsung's request for a new trial based on the company's claim the jury foreman, Velvin Hogan, was prejudiced against the company because he had been sued by Seagate, his former employer. Samsung became the largest investor in Seagate after selling a division to the hard-drive maker in 2011.","A jury last August ordered Samsung to pay Apple pay more than $1 billion .

"(CNN) -- Gerald Kulcinski has a big problem. The nuclear engineering professor at the University of Wisconsin needs a rare element to fuel his research into a fusion reactor. But the cost of the isotope -- helium-3 -- is rising faster than a rocket headed to space. A few years ago it was $1,000 a gram, this year it is $7,000 and next year, well, he assumes it will be tens of thousands of dollars. There are only about 30 kilograms of 3He on Earth, Kulcinski said. Most helium-3 comes as a byproduct of tritium, used in nuclear weapons, so the exact figure is secret. Governments covet helium-3 because it works well in sensors that detect the presence of nuclear material, such as the ones that scan incoming cargo at the nation's borders and ports. ""Worldwide demand is very high, the supply is fixed and going down, and those of us who are trying using helium-3 for research purposes are paying very high prices,"" said Kulcinski, who is the director of the Fusion Technology Institute. ""It'll basically shut off university activity pretty soon because we won't be able to afford it."" The Kulcinski team's approach toward creating fusion is unique. Ninety-nine percent of research is geared toward using deuterium and tritium together. But using helium-3 instead of tritium would be much safer and drastically cut the chance of nuclear weapons proliferation. If 3He-3He fusion works, there would be no radioactive waste. A breakthrough would be huge, but the team needs more years and more helium-3. The thing is that there are tons of helium-3 -- on the moon. About 1 million tons, Kulcinski said, adding that we also have a pretty good idea as to where the 3He is on the moon. We would know precisely how many trillions of dollars of the stuff is there if someone goes back to the moon and establishes a base there. ""A few years ago we thought we were going back soon but that's all changed now,"" he said. NASA at a crossroads . Apollo 17 astronaut and geologist Harrison Schmitt said the United States is behind in the race to return to the surface of the moon. Schmitt, who is the author of ""Return to the Moon,"" has come to the conclusion that NASA's best days are a part of history and it would be best to start over. The space agency is dysfunctional in many ways as a management entity and the past two presidents have lacked a good space policy or the implementation of one, he said. NASA could watch over our obligations to the International Space Station, he said, but missions to the moon and Mars should be handled by another group. ""It's probably time to create a new agency ... that would focus almost entirely on deep space,"" he said. ""The agency has just gotten old and most of the experience is retiring."" Next space age has a business model, astronauts say . He foresees private companies leading the way to the moon. He thinks the fusion research, rocket building and moon base project can be done for $15-20 billion over two decades. By comparison, another big nuclear fusion project (on Earth), the International Thermonuclear Reactor Project, has a €12.8 billion ($18 billion) budget. The big question for investors would be: Is it worth it when you compare it to the costs of producing other fuels like electricity from coal? Schmitt said yes, because the helium-3 on the moon is worth about $150 million per 100 kilograms. Still, capital operating costs, which would be in the billions, will have to come down, he said. The concentration of helium-3 is low, so many tons of regolith -- a combination of lunar soil, dust and other material -- would have to be mined to collect 3He. It's difficult to get investors to put money into any helium-3 project, Schmitt said. ""The folks at the University of Wisconsin have gone a long way in the early definition, or let's say, demonstration, of the physics of helium-3 fusion,"" he said, ""but we are a long way and have to go through a (long) process"" before they approach the break-even point where investors' interest will be piqued. The real challenge is proving you can burn 3He . At their lab in Madison, Wisconsin, Kulcinski and his small team of scientific staff and graduate students have developed a tabletop 3He-powered reactor that can produce a small amount of electricity. They are making progress in producing more energy than when they started more than 25 years ago, but there's still much work to be done. The catch? More energy is used than is produced. As critics often note, the promise of nuclear fusion always seems to be 50 years away. Kulcinski doesn't have an end date, a breakthrough date, in sight. ""I have no doubt that we'll be able to do it,"" he said. ""With talented scientists and engineers around the world, if we really concentrated, we could do this. ""Our group, I have all the faith in the world in them, but we're a small group, and we could be at this for a very long time."" Not the only reason to go to the moon . Schmitt and Kulcinski wholeheartedly agree on one thing -- 3He is not the only reason to return to the moon. As Schmitt said, ""We've only touched the surface of exploring it."" The main reason to go back is to learn how to live in space and use the moon as a jumping off place for missions to Mars, Kulcinski said. There are other reasons, they said, including other elements available on the moon and using the lunar surface for telescopes. But Schmitt, who has consulted for Kulcinski's project since 1985, and the professor think helium-3 has such potential it makes going back a vital mission. After all, it could potentially power the Earth for thousands of years. ""You would go to the moon for long-term clean energy,"" Kulcinski said, ""because this is really an enormous source of energy. There is 10 times more energy there than there ever was in fossil fuel on the Earth.""","Helium-3 is in scarce supply on Earth, much more abundant on the moon .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Peter Robbins was a child when he provided the iconic voice for Charlie Brown, still heard every year when the classic 1960s television movies are rebroadcast. Today, Robbins is in the San Diego County jail, inmate No. 13704837, charged with 12 felony counts of making criminal threats and stalking, authorities said. Robbins, 56, of Oceanside, California, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to the charges in San Diego County Superior Court, said District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis. Robbins is facing up to nine years in state prison for stalking his ex-girlfriend and making criminal threats against a La Jolla plastic surgeon, the prosecutor said. San Diego Superior Court Judge David Szumowski set Robbins' bail at $550,000, and he was ordered to have no contact with the two people involved in the case and not to possess a gun, Dumanis said. A readiness hearing for Robbins has been set for February 22 and a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for March 22. When heroes disappoint our kids . Border Patrol agents arrested Robbins late Sunday as he entered the United States from Mexico at the San Ysidro, California, port of entry, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman. A computer check of his passport revealed that Robbins, who was driving into the country alone in a 2006 Mercedes, was wanted in San Diego on a felony warrant, Customs spokesman Ralph DeSio said. Robbins acknowledged to police that he is the same Peter Robbins who was the child actor, San Diego Police spokesman Gary Hassen said. The four counts of threatening death and one stalking charge involve four victims, including a San Diego Police sergeant. Robbins allegedly threatened the officer with bodily harm during a January 13 incident, Hassen said. Police in Oceanside and Carlsbad, California, are also investigating incidents there, Hassan said. CNN was unable to contact Robbins or a representative for comment. Robbins was 9 in 1965 when he was cast as Charlie Brown in the animated ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown."" ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" was produced later that year, using Robbins as the lead voice. Other TV movies using Robbins' voice include ""Charlie Brown's All Stars!"" ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,"" ""You're in Love, Charlie Brown"" and ""He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown."" His last role as Charlie Brown -- ""It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown"" -- was produced when Robbins was 13. He told an interviewer in 2008 that he was replaced when his voice changed too much after he turned 14. Robbins' on-camera acting career included featured roles in episodes of TV's ""Rawhide,"" ""The Munsters,"" ""F Troop"" and ""Get Smart."" Robbins' last acting role was in a 1972 episode of ""My Three Sons,"" according to the Internet Movie Database. He grew up to become a California real estate agent, living in Oceanside with his dog, Snoopy, his official biography said. CNN's Michael Martinez and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","NEW: Peter Robbins, 56, is charged with 12 felony counts of making threats and stalking .

"(CNN) -- Over the years, I've seen a good many meetings between U.S. presidents and Israeli prime ministers on big issues during critical moments. It usually takes a few days before we can begin to make sense of what occurred and what to expect. Here's a guide to interpret last week's meeting between Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu on the Iranian nuclear issue and how to read the next several months. Best meeting yet but don't be fooled . Unlike Lehman Brothers, the U.S.-Israeli relationship really is too big to fail. Driven by the marriage of value affinity, politics and national interest, it's proved remarkably resilient over the years, particularly given the differences between a big nation and a tiny one. And this, the ninth meeting between their two leaders (while in office), was among their best. That's not saying much given the rocky relationship between the two. But for reasons of policy and politics, neither wants nor can afford a fight. The last thing Obama or Netanyahu needed was to highlight differences on Iran, even while they do differ on the timing and need for a military strike. My sense is that the president still thinks the prime minister is something of a con man and the prime minister finds the president bloodless and lacking real emotional connection when it comes to appreciating Israeli fears. There are plenty of rocky times ahead, particularly on the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, a volatile issue (now closed for the season) but bound to become combustible again should Obama be re-elected in November. Where you stand depends on where you sit . The Iranian issue highlights a fundamental truth about international politics and about Israel and America: When it comes to matters of national security and survival, size and geography can divide even the closest allies. Israel is a tiny nation that has been in conflict and at war since its inception. Despite its regional superpower status and nuclear arsenal, it still sees itself living on the knife's edge with little or no margin for error. For Israelis, pre-emption and vigilance will always trump patience and passivity. (Examples: Israeli's pre-emptive strikes in June 1967; against the Iraqi reactor in July 1981; and against an incipient Syrian nuclear facility in September 2007.) The United States is the most powerful nation on Earth. It has nonpredatory neighbors to its north and south and fish to its east and west. It has enemies, but none that pose a potential existential threat. With rare exceptions (George W. Bush's administration), the United States tends to be more deliberate and reactive in the projection of its military power because it has greater discretion. This gap can never be closed. The Israelis are not poised to strike Iran anytime soon, but in threatening military action, they have used the urgency to place the nuclear issue at the top of the president's agenda. We shouldn't be pushed by the Israelis into war with Iran, but we cannot trivialize their concerns either. They might act even if it means only a temporary delay in the Iranian program and at tremendous cost to the United States. It is the way of the small power. Prevention, not containment . Perhaps the most important development to emerge from the meeting last week was Obama's clear reset of the frame of reference within which American policy toward Iran will now play out. He gave very little away to the prime minister in terms of assurances, let alone guarantees, of American military action against Iran. But he did highlight the new vocabulary: Containment of Iran and its nuclear program won't do anymore. Prevention of an Iranian nuclear weapon is now the strategic objective. The president has alluded to preventing Iran from acquiring a weapon before, but these days, it takes on a much more activist cast. The Bush administration pushed containment and didn't seriously consider striking Iran's nuclear facilities. Given the changing context, this president might well be called on to make good on his commitment. Indeed, Obama is not prepared to acquiesce to Iran becoming a nuclear weapons state. Living on borrowed time . For the time being, the president and the prime minister agree nonmilitary means should be used to try to prevent Iran from pursuing its enrichment activities. Netanyahu wanted a green light from the president should he deem it necessary to strike Iran. He didn't get it. Obama wanted a red light from the prime minister that he wouldn't exercise a military option. The president didn't get that either. This wasn't a meeting about making decisions or exchanging ironclad assurances that would commit either leader to a particular course of action. The reason for that is there's no solution to the Iranian nuclear issue in sight. Neither leader will surrender his freedom of action: The prime minister to strike if necessary; the president to avoid encouraging the Israelis to do so or to commit the U.S. to do it for the Israelis. That leaves a big gap and no clear path to a nonmilitary outcome. Indeed, without a serious negotiation between Iran and the P5 +1 (the United States, China, Russia, France, Britain and Germany), we're drifting toward a military option, most likely by Israel. The roadrunner/coyote game . We will likely see more cat and mouse games, or in this case coyote and roadrunner games, perhaps with a return to the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 on the issue of enrichment. Iran as roadrunner will continue to try to evade efforts to constrain their nuclear enrichment program. The West as coyote will try to stop them. In this case, the game of covert war and pressure, replete with sanctions, cyberattacks and assassinations, will likely continue. It's clearly preferable to an overt one. Coyote will try any number of ways to lay traps for roadrunner. More than likely, they will fail. Only one country can prevent Iran from acquiring the capacity to arm itself with nuclear weapons, and that's Iran, should it decide the costs of the nuclear effort are just too steep. Four countries outside of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have nuclear weapons: Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea. All wanted them, and all got them. Perhaps this time around, since we're more focused and determined, we'll have better luck with Iran. But barring a change in the mullahacracy's motivation to develop the capacity to produce a nuke, I wouldn't bet the mortgage on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron Miller: Last week's meeting was the best between Obama, Netanyahu .
Still, he says the two men do not get along well, and their nations view world differently .
He says Israel, always threatened, will always opt for preemption over patience .
Miller: Biggest change is Obama's focus on preventing Iranian nuclear weapon ."
"(CNN) -- Director Oliver Stone was recently a speaker at a JFK assassination conference in Pittsburgh, and he was left wondering why the symposium wasn't getting a lot of love. After all, it had assembled experts renowned in the field, including forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht and investigator Josiah ""Tink"" Thompson (""who did the original bullet work""). ""I'm here in Pittsburgh with 50 experts who really have done a lifetime of free work on this,"" Stone told CNN. ""It was in the paper here, but it should be front page news throughout the United States. I wish people would come here and cover this."" Stone, along with the rest of America, is revisiting President John F. Kennedy's assassination on the 50th anniversary, which is why he's just rereleased ""JFK"" on DVD and in select theaters. Ever since the film's release in 1991, Stone says more evidence has been made available that reinforces his work, such as the report by the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), ""which if anything, widens some of the loopholes found by the Warren Commission,"" and makes him more certain of the scenario presented in ""JFK."" ""There's nothing in the movie that I would go back on,"" he said. Alternatively, he dismisses works such as Gerald Posner's ""Case Closed,"" which he said was discredited. Stone: We're not all conspiracy theorists . In the film ""JFK,"" Stone tears apart the Warren Commission's report that a single shooter -- Lee Harvey Oswald -- fired three shots from the sixth floor of the nearby book depository. This is referred to as the ""magic bullet"" theory because of the time frame and trajectory required for a bullet to make the path and wounds that transpired. Instead of Oswald as a shooter acting alone, a number of direct and indirect co-conspirators at the highest levels of government are posited in ""JFK."" They include the CIA, the FBI, the Secret Service, then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as the mafia and the military-industrial complex, for a variety of combined motives. Despite his scholarly approach, Stone feels he and like-minded others are lumped together and dismissed as ""conspiracy theorists,"" when now, more than ever, ""we've since learned as Americans that the government lies, extensively,"" he said, citing the lead-up to the war in Iraq, revelations of U.S. government secrets via WikiLeaks and the Edward Snowden/NSA scandal. ""Suddenly the trust in government has receded considerably."" One JFK conspiracy theory that could be true . Yet when it comes to the JFK assassination, he says some people ""always dismiss the stuff as 'conspiracy theorizing,' without ever knowing about it. A lot of the media who criticize these films, or criticize me, they've never read anything, any of the countermaterial."" If people knew about those loopholes, Stone said, the single-shooter theory and the ""magic bullet"" theory ""fall apart, if anybody in their right mind looks at it,"" Stone said. ""It angers me sometimes, to think of the degree of stupidity about Oswald and the Mannlicher-Carcano (rifle) on the sixth floor making these shots. It's almost as if we don't believe what we see with our own eyes in the Zapruder film."" Eyewitnesses who've come forward in recent years also provide evidence that shots came from more than one location or angle. One such eyewitness, a Parkland Hospital surgeon who spoke at the conference, has become vocal about the wounds to Kennedy's head. Robert McClelland ""came out, finally, after being frightened all these years,"" Stone said, ""and said that the bigger wound was to the rear, to the right, and the cerebellum was practically falling out."" In addition to McClelland, Stone said ""the ARRB deposed 10 witnesses to this massive head wound. A lot of people are coming out and saying, 'I was there. I stared into his brain, which was spilling out the back of his head.' This is so obvious, that it's from more than one side."" Stone makes link to Cold War policies . Part of Stone's ""Untold History of the United States"" series, also recently released on DVD, provides historical context in the chapter on JFK. ""My best answer to people who would criticize anything we say in the 'JFK' movie is to look at Chapter Six of 'Untold History,' 'JFK: To the Brink,' to understand the man, and the big picture of events,"" Stone said. ""We look for the big changes that happen after his death. What did he achieve? And what is the difference between him and Lyndon Johnson, who followed him, and the man who preceded him, Dwight Eisenhower? You may not agree with some of our conclusions, but the facts are solid. We didn't make it up."" Amanpour: We are 'quite rightly obsessed' with JFK, says historian . Stone explained that after Harry Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy was the third president of a national security state with a Cold War mentality, and when his policy shifted away from that, he was ""removed."" ""A president gets killed in Dallas, and we go back to a Cold War mindset, we go back to a military-industrial reaction in all situations,"" Stone said. ""It was certainly a reassertion of policies that existed after WWII,"" and even after the decline of the Soviet Union (""the reason for the national security state""), the policies continue and ""even accelerate, to where we are now. And we are now locked into a system where we don't seem to be able to break out of, where we're the global security. We're in charge of this empire, or whatever they call it."" This chain of events, described in ""Untold History,"" is a ""tragedy,"" Stone said. (This chapter is also included in the ""JFK"" reissue.) Most of the Kennedy clan keeps its distance . Because ""JFK"" was ""such a controversial film, Stone said most of the extended Kennedy clan ""wanted to stay away from it. ""I think they've been very circumspect about this, because they lost two brothers, Robert and John, and it was very painful for them."" However, John F. Kennedy Jr. did approach the director to discuss the film and Stone's theories, he said. ""I did speak with him many years ago, before he died,"" the director said. ""He came to see me. He was interested in what happened, in my thoughts about what happened,"" which resulted in a piece for the conspiracy issue of ""George"" magazine back in 1998. ""I think conspiracies go on all the time,"" Stone said. ""I think accidents do, too. Random accidents and conspiracies have existed side by side for centuries, definitely. It's part of life. I'm not an innocent in that regard."" But ask him about non-JFK conspiracies of recent times, and he hesitates. ""I'm not really into that kind of thinking. But the biggest conspiracy of all for me is the one I grew up under, which was sprouted by my father, a Republican conservative, and the entire establishment of this country, which was, 'Hey, the Chinese and the Russians are in a conspiracy to take over the world!' McCarthy added to the conspiracy, but they were saying, 'They're in our schools. They're in our police force. They're in our government. They're your back-door neighbor.' "" ""That's a conspiracy, OK? George W. Bush was involved in a conspiracy that Iraq was involved in 9/11. Come on! And he sold that conspiracy idea to all these big-shot news organizations. Who's kidding who? Conspiracies exist if you can see them. People make up stories. They make the enemy bigger than they are."" Although Stone entertained the conspiracy talk with the anniversary and reissues, he did note that the one story about himself that he'd like to see die is the one that makes him out to be the go-to conspiracy guy. ""If you look at my body of work, every film is different. It's confining if you're always judging me by, 'Oh, is there a conspiracy in it?' That's ridiculous!"" For one thing, the film he had hoped to make but went to someone else was ""Evita."" As he laughed, ""events conspired against me.""

"(CNN) -- Four-year-old Jacob Spillers was trapped in mud so thick it was like freshly poured concrete. But the little trouper didn't panic as rescuers worked to free him from the mudslide that had swallowed most of his house and trapped his father and some other family members Saturday. ""He didn't cry. He didn't move. He just stood there and was a very composed little man,"" Ed Hrivnak, a volunteer pilot for the Snohomish County Helicopter Rescue Team, told CNN on Tuesday. Jacob was upstairs when the mudslide swept through the house. His father and three half-siblings have yet to be found. Randy Fay, a helicopter rescue team coordinator for Snohomish County, on Wednesday recalled spotting the boy ""out in the middle of nowhere"" not long after his crew first flew over the scene Saturday. ""We have no clue how he ended up there by himself,"" Fay said. ""(There were) no homes, no nothing."" Jacob's dramatic rescue was recorded by a camera on the Snohomish rescue team's helicopter. It was an uneasy save. The helicopter couldn't set down on the uneven, sticky soil so it hovered a few feet above the ground. The rotors sucked up debris, chopping up insulation and spitting it all over the scene. Two men who lived nearby saw the child; one managed to get to him, but no one could get any traction in what Fay described as ""a mushy slurry (that) once you got into it, there was no way to push yourself up."" By the time rescuers got to the boy, his pants had fallen to around his ankles. They came off entirely ""when we pulled him out of the mud,"" Fay remembered. That left the boy ""shivering badly"" wearing only his underwear and a sleeveless T-shirt, according to Fay. But at least he could get warm, and at least he was safe. And he was calm as he was passed up into the arms of crew chief Beau Beckner. ""That little guy was very brave,"" Beckner wrote on the rescue team's Facebook page. Another woman rescued that Saturday, Robin Youngblood, recalled talking to the boy and cradling him in a blanket. ""I said, 'Honey I'm a grandma, I'll take care of you until we figure this out,'"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. ""... I sang him songs, and I just tried to help him stay calm."" Jacob's mother, Jonielle Spillers, is safe. She was at work during Saturday's mudslide, which killed at least 16 people and destroyed much of two towns north of Seattle. Another eight bodies have been found but not recovered, officials said. As of Wednesday, a county official said that 90 people were officially missing or unaccounted for.

"Daegu, South Korea (CNN) -- Seung-min's room has not changed in seven months. Even the bed is exactly as he made it, just hours before taking his own life. The 13-year-old was bullied at school, and he committed suicide by jumping out of his home's seventh floor window. His mother, Lim Jee-young, reads his suicide note as she has countless times since his death. In the note he describes being beaten and robbed by boys in his class, burned with lighters and having electrical wire tied around his neck as a leash. At the end of the letter he says: ""I love you mum and dad, please don't be sad I'm gone, I'll wait for you."" Lim had no idea her son was being bullied. ""The bullies began to come to our house before we got home and beat him,"" she says. ""It got to the extent they were using a wooden stick and boxing gloves. But he didn't tell us any of this."" Lim and her husband were called by the police the day he died last December. She recalls the moment she arrived home and saw a body outside her apartment block covered in a white cloth. Bullied Chinese boy recovering from assault . ""I pulled back the cloth and saw my son,"" she says. ""I put my arms around him and felt he was still warm. I said he's still alive, and I called for a doctor, but they told me he is already dead. When I looked up I saw the open window."" As she says this, Lim looks over at the window her son jumped from, reliving the horror. The boys who bullied her son have since been prosecuted and sent to a juvenile correction center, but Lim -- herself a teacher -- says the school is also at fault. ""The school wants to cover it up. Just five months before my son was killed, a girl in the same grade committed suicide because of bullying. But nothing was done, so it happened again."" The boy's school declined to comment for this story to CNN but has since replaced its principal. School violence in South Korea is causing alarm at the highest levels of government. ""While the former generation overlooked it, school violence has become an important social issue,"" President Lee Myung-bak said in his opening of parliament earlier this month ""This will not only influence the victims but also teenagers and society as a whole."" Teen says bullies beat him, sues New York schools . The government announced a round of new measures to counter bullying in February, including forced suspensions of students found to be involved in school violence. They also lowered the age students can face criminal penalties to 12 from 14. One of the main reasons for bullying in South Korea is intense competition between classmates and pressure to do well at school, experts say. ""At school, students don't see their peers as friends but as competition and believe they need to beat them to get ahead,"" says Joo Mi Bae, a clinical psychologist. ""Students who are good in their studies can immerse themselves in that, those who are not might try to bully or control someone else."" Government figures show the incidents of school violence are starting to fall, but there is still a high number of teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 taking their own lives -- 353 in 2010, or almost one youth suicide every day, according to the South Korea National Statistics Office. Schools are being encouraged to hold more team sports, rather than just celebrating individual success. Many schools also now have counseling services or so-called WEE classes. WEE stands for ""We, Education, Emotion and is an attempt by the government to give those who need help someone to talk to. Cho Hyun-jun, 17, used the counseling service to get advice for his friend who is being bullied. ""Bullying victims have a hard time,"" he says, ""because they feel there is no one they can ask for help, so a place like this is really important.""

"Madrid (CNN) -- The Spanish nurse's assistant who contracted Ebola after treating a patient with the deadly virus is feeling a little better and says she would treat Ebola patients again if she is cured, a family friend and spokeswoman said Wednesday. Teresa Romero Ramos is being treated at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, the same hospital where she contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa. She spoke to her husband, Javier Limon, by phone for 10 minutes, family spokeswoman Teresa Mesa told journalists outside the hospital Wednesday. She said Romero was stable and doing better, though hospital officials said Tuesday she remains in serious condition. Romero has been drinking water since Tuesday night, and doctors are hopeful about her condition, Mesa said. She's not yet been able to eat anything. It was in her conversation with her husband that Romero said she would pick up where she left off in caring for Ebola patients, Mesa said. ""Javier told me she is such a fool that when she gets out of here, she will do it again,"" Mesa said . ""He said, 'Honey, are you going to do it again?' And she said, 'Do what?' And he says, 'Well, that. Risk your life.' And she says, 'Yeah, but now I have the antivirus, now it's OK.' That was the response of Teresa."" For Ebola caregivers, enormous fear, risk and bravery . Romero doesn't know about dog's death . Romero asked Limon about her dog but does not yet know that it was put down by officials concerned that it might carry the Ebola virus, Mesa said. Hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition to try to stop authorities from euthanizing the dog, while dozens of protesters demonstrated outside the couple's home. Limon, who has been kept under observation in a hospital as a high-risk contact, has criticized authorities' handling of the Ebola crisis. In a scathing letter released Monday, he said his wife had received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister. A special committee set up by the government to handle the outbreak said Wednesday that all 15 people under observation in hospital remained asymptomatic. Meanwhile, the Spanish government continues to deal with the fallout of Romero becoming the first person to contract Ebola in the current outbreak outside Africa. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy faced a grilling in Parliament on Wednesday from opposition lawmakers over the government's response so far. A hospital source told journalists Wednesday that one floor of the facility is being remodeled to better prepare it for handling Ebola cases. How did Spanish nurse catch Ebola? Spanish bases . As international efforts to combat Ebola grow larger, the United States is seeking permission to use two of Spain's bases as a transit point for flights to Africa carrying military personnel and supplies. Spain has agreed that some U.S. flights heading to Africa can use its Rota naval and Moron air bases -- but has not yet approved their use by flights returning from Africa, a Spanish Defense Ministry spokesman said Wednesday. The United States already has troops stationed at those bases. Spanish Defense Minister Pedro Morenes is due to meet U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in Washington on Friday. U.S. Ambassador to Madrid James Costos told Spain's Antena 3 TV station that the United States was not planning for U.S. military personnel to provide direct patient care or for U.S. military aircraft to transport symptomatic patients. He said the U.S. request was being considered on case-by-case basis. The U.S. Embassy has said a small number of such transit flights have already been approved. Washington is hoping Spain will approve the wider request. The U.S. Embassy has said Rota and Moron are two among other bases the United States would use in various countries, as the military tries to keep different options available for the transit of personnel and supplies in the Ebola fight. There are more than 500 U.S. troops in the region currently, and the Pentagon has authorized the deployment of up to 4,000 to assist in fighting the virus. Troops are not expected to treat Ebola patients, but there is an acknowledgment by the Pentagon that some could be at risk of coming into contact with the virus. CNN's Victoria Eastwood, Barbara Starr and Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","Spanish nurse's assistant Teresa Romero Ramos speaks to her husband by phone .

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka, the teardrop-shaped island that in 2009 emerged from more than a quarter century of civil war, has staked claim as one of Asia's most exciting new destinations. With the beaches of Negombo and Galle on the West Coast and World Heritage-listed ancient cities, Sri Lanka is experiencing a tourism boom. As the country's tourism offerings have grown more sophisticated, so have its hotels. Here are a selection of the best. Reefs Edge . It's only 20 minutes from the capital Colombo, but stand on the balcony of Reefs Edge and you'll feel like you're on a deserted island. The view of the Indian Ocean is obstructed only by palm trees, affording guests front-row seats to blood red and beautiful sunsets. A velvet green lawn runs 20 meters from the hotel to the beach, where sun beds and wicker domes beckon layabouts and drinkers of cocktails. Though it has only 22 suites, Reefs Edge has the look and feel of a large hotel. Inside, French oak flooring, pastel-colored furniture and open-air bathrooms decked out with rain showers and glass washbasins creating an aura of simple sophistication. Complete with a day spa, gymnasium, steam room, seafood restaurant and a separate 250-seat banquet hall shaped like Noah's Ark, Reefs Edge takes the edge off a vacation in Sri Lanka.

Located in a quiet alleyway perpendicular to the main drag, the St. Lachlan is a boutique property with 16 rooms and suites. The interior speaks colonial cool: it has 10-foot-high doors with giant brass knockers, richly varnished shutters and teak furniture everywhere you look, with antlers and indigenous artwork accentuating the walls. A riot of giant freshwater prawns, snapper and spices, the seafood platter at Arias, St. Lachlan's poolside restaurant, is among the best in Negombo. Little wonder -- it's run by Harpo Gooneratne, commonly known as Sri Lanka's first DJ and popular restaurateur.

"London, England (CNN) -- Paving slabs that convert energy from people's footsteps into electricity are set to help power Europe's largest urban mall, at the 2012 London Olympics site. The recycled rubber ""PaveGen"" paving slabs harvest kinetic energy from the impact of people stepping on them and instantly deliver tiny bursts of electricity to nearby appliances. The slabs can also store energy for up to three days in an on-board battery, according to its creator. In their first commercial application, 20 tiles will be scattered along the central crossing between London's Olympic stadium and the recently opened Westfield Stratford City mall -- which expects an estimated 30 million customers in its first year. ""That should be enough feet to power about half its (the mall's) outdoor lighting needs,"" said Laurence Kemball-Cook, a 25-year-old engineering graduate who developed the prototype during his final year of university in 2009. The green slabs are designed to compress five millimeters when someone steps on them, but PaveGen will not share the precise mechanism responsible for converting absorbed kinetic energy into electricity. Although each step produces only enough electricity to keep an LED-powered street lamp lit for 30 seconds, Kemball-Cook says that the tiles are a real-world ""crowdsourcing"" application, harnessing small contributions from a large number of individuals. ""We recently came back from a big outdoor festival where we got over 250,000 footsteps -- that was enough to charge 10,000 mobile phones,"" said Kemball-Cook. The young inventor envisages PaveGen systems being used to power off-grid appliances such as public lighting, illuminated street maps and advertising, and to be installed in areas of dense human traffic such as city centers, underground stations and school corridors. ""Our main test installation is at a school in Kent (southeast England) -- where 1,100 kids have devoted their lives to stamping all over them for the last eight months,"" said Kemball-Cook. In its current form, the PaveGen paving slab contains a low-energy LED which lights up, expressing the energy transfer idea to the user but only consuming around 5% of the energy from each footstep. ""This is what I really enjoy about the design,"" said Richard Miller, head of sustainability at the UK's government-funded Technology Strategy Board. ""As much as it's an effective, common-sense source of some sustainable electricity, it's also a great way for people to engage with the issue of sustainability ... to feel like they are part of the solution in a very immediate, fun and visual way that doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't already be doing,"" said Miller. However, although generally enthusiastic about the product, for the time being Miller withholds speculation about its far-reaching impact. ""As with all things of this nature, on a large scale and in the long term, its success will be determined by how cost-effective it is to produce ... If it turns out to be expensive, then it will struggle to find a place as anything more than a niche application,"" he said. Kemball-Cook declines to comment on the cost of each slab, arguing that their current price is much higher than what it will be when they go into mass production. That said, the company has already won a spate of awards, including the Big Idea category at the UK's Ethical Business Awards and the Shell LiveWire Grand Ideas Award. PaveGen has also recently received a round of financing from a group of London-based angel investors, although the sum is undisclosed. Kemball-Cook is confident that the slab is durable. Over the course of a month it was subjected to a machine that replicates the pounding of footsteps, non-stop every day, he added. ""It's also really easy to install as a retrofit on existing pavements, because they can be made to match their exact dimensions ... you just replace one slab with another,"" he said. Looking to the future, Kemball-Cook would like to see the paving system introduced to the developing world, in areas that have a high footfall, but are off-grid, such as the slums in Mumbai. ""The average person takes 150 million steps in their lifetime, just imagine the potential,"" he said.","Engineer has developed paving slab that transforms energy from footsteps into electricity .

"(CNN) -- A California woman stabbed repeatedly by her then-boyfriend, a comedic Hollywood actor, on Friday described his courtroom antics explaining his violence as ""very surreal and bizarre"" -- and, above all, insincere. ""In his testimony, he stated that it was the knife that did it, and he stated this repeatedly,"" Kendra Beebe told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell. ""In fact it wasn't the knife that stabbed me 23 times. It was Shelley Malil."" One day earlier, San Diego, California, County Superior Court Judge Harry Elias sentenced Malil to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Five years ago, the actor was cracking up audiences as an electronics store clerk in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" But in August 2008, he was arrested in North County, California and charged with stabbing Beebe. Earlier this fall, a California jury found him guilty of premeditated attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. He was found not guilty of burglary. Malil received near the maximum sentence for his convictions. But his former girlfriend said that, while she was pleased with the jury's verdict, she still doesn't think the punishment was severe enough. ""I feel like I did get justice in our system. But is the system fair and just? I don't think so,"" Beebe said. Beebe survived the attack, despite having her chin severely cut, two collapsed lungs and losing about half the blood in her body, her attorney Gloria Allred told HLN on Friday. In September, she testified that she'd initially thought that Malil was going to hug her when he approached her in her home, as her young children slept upstairs, that summer night. But instead, he began cutting her repeatedly with a knife -- a fact that Malil did not deny. ""I saw this flashing silver, and he goes bang, bang, bang,"" Beebe said in court. The Indian-born actor -- who, according to the Internet Movie Database, has appeared in at least 54 movies and television projects, from Budweiser commercials, to guest appearances on ""Scrubs"" and ""Reba,"" to his break-out performance as Steve Carell's co-worker Haziz in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" -- testified that he stabbed his girlfriend by mistake, thinking he was defending her. On Thursday, he apologized in court. ""For what I did to Kendra, I don't even have the words to express my remorse or my feeling sorry. Kendra Beebe did not deserve anything that happened to her,"" Malil said. Malil's 19-year-old niece, Anjali Varghese, testified at the sentencing hearing that her uncle's ""crime was not a result of any kind of ingrained malice, because that's not his nature."" Yet Beebe said that the actor's testimony left her unconvinced, feeling ""so frustrated and angry."" ""It was horrible,"" she said. ""He sure lied and lied and lied on the stand.""","NEW:The woman stabbed by actor Shelley Malil's says he lied and can't be trusted .

"(CNN) -- The other day I was engaged in a rather thoughtful conversation with one of my CNN co-workers, an Ivy League-educated, award-winning journalist who's admired for her compassion and charm. She asked me to fart. Now, I don't want to embarrass this individual by sharing her name, but it was definitely Jessica Ravitz. The conversation went like this. Jessica: ""I can't believe I'm saying this, but I sort of want you to do it."" (I fart. It was silent.) Me: ""How's that for you?"" Jessica: ""No! You didn't!"" Me: ""Oh, I did."" Jessica: ""Really? Seriously? I can't smell a thing."" We give each other high fives. You see, I was wearing Shreddies, a new flatulence-filtering underwear that recently made news all over the Web. It was actually trending several weeks ago, and I was hoping to write about the product then, while it was still a big talker online. However, I'm a serious journalist with literally hours of experience, and I felt it just wasn't enough to simply mention that these things exist. I had to actually try them out. So they shipped me a fresh pair from the UK. At least I hope they were fresh. Either way, they're not now. Eventually, they arrived. And after a three-day trial run on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of this week, it's finally time for a serious conversation about farts. Which is great, because it's basically my beat. ""We've got breaking fart news! Bellini, you need to fly to Pittsburgh right away."" ""Will this assignment require pants?"" So, yeah, we're talking about farts. And I apologize for nothing. In fact, if you think this topic is gross or lowbrow, just consider some words by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. In June, while speaking to an audience in Australia, he explained that, at our core, all people are the same. And then he shared this wonderful anecdote. ""When in aeroplane, sometimes this gas problem comes,"" he said. ""Then, you see, it is difficult to let out. So, occasionally, you see, look around, then you go like that."" His Holiness leaned over to the side as though he was letting out a big ripper and then proceeded to laugh like a 12-year-old boy. Because farts are funny. Even to the Dalai Lama. THE PRODUCT . Shreddies were invented by a British industrial designer named Paul O'Leary, and the name comes from a colloquial term used for underwear that originated with the British Forces. I was told that soldiers would literally shred their underwear from marching so much. Hence, Shreddies. But these Shreddies are nothing like the worn and torn undies that the name suggests. Or the ones I bought from Target in 2003, which are still clinging to life. Here, O'Leary actually worked with lingerie designers from De Montfort University's lingerie design course (where the hell was this when I was in college?) and utilized something called Zorflex, an activated carbon cloth that has traditionally been used in chemical warfare suits. So, basically, it's like attaching a military-strength Brita to your butt. Though you definitely don't want to try this at home unless you long for an awkward conversation at the emergency room. ""... and that's how it happened."" ""Sir, I'm not a doctor. This is the cafeteria."" But there doesn't appear to be anything bulky or dangerous about this Zoflex cloth, which is perfectly comfortable, sewn naturally right into the rear of the underwear. And as you release gas, the stink particles -- that's a technical term -- get trapped in the magic science filter, allowing you to confidently eat all sorts of horrible things and fart in the company of friends and strangers. Which is exactly what I did. THE EXPERIMENT . Day One started out like any other: sad and mired in self doubt. But after peeling myself out of bed, I made some coffee, had a banana and drank down some dark chocolate almond milk before leaving for the office. This would be my standard breakfast throughout the experiment, a more or less healthy start to the day. Everything else was pure terror. We're talking pizza and tacos and soda. And when all that wasn't working, I thought, ""Welp, a heaping pile of roast beef ought to do it."" And it did. A little. But, how was I to know if the Shreddies were actually working? This experiment needed a control. So, I did what absolutely had to be done. I cupped one. (Pause for completely unrelated question: Why don't women like me?) Now, for the sake of the more puritanical among our audience, I won't go into too many more details. Just know that the experiment was working and, over the next two and a half days, I would continue this aggressive line of eating, consuming everything from shepherd's pie to a dank, soupy bowl of cheap fast food chili. All in the name of journalism. And here's the end result: These things work. I put Shreddies through the ultimate endurance test, and they lived up to their promise. And Jessica was right there to back me up. ""I can't say I've ever asked someone to fart for me, and I'm not particularly proud that I did,"" she said. ""But someone had to fact-check what Jarrett was doing. Thankfully, those undies work."" I apologize for nothing.

"(CNN) -- The FBI said Monday it believes it knows who was behind one of the most significant art heists in the United States -- the 1990 theft of 13 precious works, once valued at $500 million, from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. A couple of big catches in the announcement: The FBI didn't reveal the suspects' names, said that the statute of limitations has run out so it can't charge anyone with the theft and that the artwork still hasn't been recovered. The FBI said the suspects ""are members of a criminal organization with a base in the mid-Atlantic states and New England."" The bureau also said it believes the artwork -- including paintings by Rembrandt and Vermeer -- was taken to Connecticut and the Philadelphia area and that the thieves unsuccessfully tried to sell some of the artwork in Philadelphia about 10 years ago. Charges still could be brought in the future against anyone holding the stolen masters. But authorities suggested the possibility of immunity would be considered should someone involved in keeping the art hidden away come forward and help the FBI to recover it. ""After the attempted sale ... the FBI's knowledge of the art's whereabouts is limited,"" the FBI said in a statement released Monday. At a Boston news conference, reporters pressed the FBI to name the suspected thieves, but officials declined, saying doing so might harm the ongoing investigation. The announcement comes on the 23rd anniversary of the theft, which the FBI says is one of the largest property crimes in U.S. history. In March 1990 two men posing as Boston police officers entered the museum in the middle of the night and tied up two watchmen. Among the the stolen items was a painting called ""The Concert"" by Johannes Vermeer, one of only 34 known paintings by the Dutch artist. Also pilfered were works by Rembrandt, Manet and Degas. Many view this as the single greatest art heist of all time. U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said she has visited the Dutch Room at the museum several times and has seen the empty frames where the paintings once hung. ""I was reminded of the enormous impact of this theft,"" said Ortiz. ""I do remain optimistic that one day soon the paintings will be returned to their rightful place."" The FBI says it's releasing the new details of the probe in part to remind people of a $5 million reward for information leading to the recovery of the items in good condition. The FBI's publicity effort will include a website devoted to the Gardner Museum robbery and the use of social networks and advertising on digital billboards in the Philadelphia region.

"(CNN) -- Tommy John pitched 26 seasons in the major leagues, with his 700 career starts ranking him 8th all-time among major league baseball pitchers. But eclipsing his lasting legacy on the mound is the story of his injury, the pioneering surgery and rehabilitation he endured, and the lasting impact the eponymous operation has had on hundreds of players ever since. Today, sports fans and athletes hear the term ""Tommy John surgery"" and don't flinch; it's no longer seen as a career-ender. There are currently 29 active ballplayers in the major leagues slated to have, or who have already have had, Tommy John surgery, according to MLBDepthcharts.com. They include the Chicago White Sox' Philip Humber, who pitched only the 21st perfect game in Major League Baseball history last Saturday. He underwent a successful Tommy John surgery in 2005. Another is the Colorado Rockies' Jamie Moyer, who last week became the oldest pitcher -- at age 49 -- to record a victory in the major leagues. Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction surgery, as it's medically known, is a grafting procedure in which doctors take tendons from another part of the body -- the forearm, hamstring, hip or knee -- and replace the medial ligament in the elbow with the grafted portion. Two holes are drilled into the patient's arm bones and the replacement ligament is woven between the two holes in a pattern resembling a figure-eight. So what does John think of his name becoming synonymous with such a high-profile medical procedure? ""If I'd known you could throw a perfect game with this, I would have tried a little harder,"" quipped John, now 68. When he refers to the operation, without hesitation, he calls it Tommy John surgery, saying it's an honor to have the operation referred to by his name. On July 17, 1974, the then 31-year-old John was pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Montreal Expos. He recalled the fateful moment. ""I had runners on first and second. I was trying to get the batter to hit a sinker to get him to hit a ground ball so I could get two and get out of the inning unscathed. I threw a sinker and right as I threw, I felt this searing pain and the ball just blooped up to the plate and I went, 'Holy mackerel, what did I do?'"" He would attempt another pitch before leaving the game. ""I got to the bench, I got my jacket and I told our trainer, I said Billy, let's get Dr. Jobe -- something's wrong, get Dr. Jobe, and the rest is history,"" John said. Dr. Frank Jobe was the Los Angeles Dodgers' orthopedic surgeon and a good friend of John's. After several examinations, Jobe gave the pitcher grim news: if he didn't have surgery, he would never play major league baseball again. For John, the notion was unthinkable. And while he trusted Jobe and considered him a friend, the surgery had never been attempted by a medical professional. ""He told me what he was going to do,"" John recalled, ""He said, if you've pulled it off the bone, then what we'll do is just reattach it to the bone and it will be no problem. But if it's not, I'm going to have to take this tendon from your right forearm and graft it into your left elbow."" John, a college math major, asked his surgeon friend for the odds of a successful outcome. Jobe put the odds at 1%. ""Well, I was valedictorian of my high school class and 1% or 2% in 100 is far better than zero percent in 100,"" he said. On September 25, 1974, Jobe performed the surgery. The rehab was grueling, initially leaving John with what he calls a ""claw hand."" There was a subsequent surgery to repair nerve damage. After 16 weeks, he was able to finally throw a baseball. He would miss the entire 1975 season. But John recalls his rehabilitation pitching regimen after surgery as being a true test. ""I threw the ball every single day except Sunday. My reasoning was that if God rested on Sunday, I thought Tommy John should too."" He returned to baseball in 1976 and pitched 13 more seasons, ending his career in 1989. So why do players still suffer injuries requiring Tommy John surgery? John says it's because coaches overwork young players in today's game. Most kids, according to John, pitch year-round, while their arms are still developing. ""Did Steve Carlton throw 12 months out of the year? No. Why would you take guys that are less skilled and younger and abuse their arm for 12 months when the best in the world don't do it for 12 months?"" John said. Players facing Tommy John surgery today still face months of grueling rehab. When asked why, despite medical advances, rehab time really hadn't improved, John said, ""I think you have to give your arm rest. God will heal your arm. Nature, your body was made to heal."" There's no ""Tommy John club"" for the hundreds of players who can thank him for pioneering the medical procedure that saved their careers. Although he's thought about inviting some of them to play in a golf tournament, John says he doesn't stay in touch with the players who go through the procedure. John now lives in New Jersey, and says he feels good. ""My elbow is fine -- my shoulder is shot -- but my elbow is fine,"" John said. And when he watches the Dodgers baseball today, does he root for the pitcher who has undergone Tommy John surgery or his former team? He says he roots for players. ""I never was a team guy. Well, I'm a Bears fan and a Cubs fan. But I never was a team fan."" John is still active in baseball, still scouts players, and recently managed for the independent Bridgeport Bluefish, a job he calls ""the most fun I ever had."" He also works for a company that sells scoreboards to sporting venues. He recognizes that some young fans know him for the surgery and not his baseball career, but he's not bothered. ""I thank God that Dr. Jobe did what he had to do and I did what I had to do. And it will be forever known as Tommy John surgery. I'll be dust in the ground and Tommy John surgery will probably be living on.""","Hundreds of baseball players have had Tommy John surgery .
John says it's an honor to have the operation named after him .
The rise in the number of surgeries is due to younger players playing year-round, John says ."
"(CNN) -- The giant Buddhas of Bamiyan, once painted in bright colors, remained silent sentinels as they reacquired the hues of the sandstone cliffs from which they were carved. The statues, which looked upon a visually stunning region of central Afghanistan for about 1,500 years, have been gone for 10 years, victims of the Taliban, who destroyed them as part of its campaign to destroy pre-Islamic artifacts considered an assault on the faith. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on Wednesday will begin three days of meetings in Paris about a long-range plan for preserving the snow-capped valley's cultural heritage and the remains of the Buddhas, which overlooked a Buddhist monastery. ""They were destroyed in the context of the conflict devastating Afghanistan and to undermine the power of culture as a cohesive force for the Afghan people,"" said UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova in a statement Monday. A German professor believes reconstructing the smaller figure is possible. UNESCO, which is nearing the completion of an effort to preserve the Buddha niches in Bamiyan and wall paintings, does not favor rebuilding the figures. But it does want to protect the 5,000 fragments of what were once among the world's great artistic and religious treasures. Today, the massive caves where the Buddhas once stood are huge, empty pockets carved into cliffs that dominate the countryside. The recovered pieces -- many the size of large boulders, others as tiny as pebbles -- are stored in several shelters. The smaller female Buddha stood around 10 or 11 stories tall. Professor Erwin Emmerling of the Technical University of Munich, Germany, said reconstruction of the female Buddha is possible, using remaining parts and other materials, according to the university's website. It would not necessarily resemble the ancient statue. The scientist said the work would require a small factory to be built in the Bamiyan Valley. Otherwise, 1,400 rocks, some weighing 2 tons, would have to be sent to Germany. Emmerling will present his findings at the UNESCO conference. The Afghanistan government will have the final decision on any such steps. The statues survived the ravages of Mongolian conqueror and warrior Genghis Khan, centuries of wars and the natural wear and tear of the elements. In March 2001, Taliban militants, using explosives and tank fire, spent weeks blowing up the two colossal figures. One was 55 meters (180 feet) high, the other 38 meters (125 feet). The Technical University analyzed fragments of the statues and determined they were once painted in brilliant shades of blue, pink, orange and red. They had been repainted several times, possibly because of fading, Emmerling said. In 2003, with the support of the governments of France, Britain, Italy and Japan, work was begun on restoring the destroyed artifacts. UNESCO that same year placed the cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley on its World Heritage List and List in Danger. ""The site testifies to the region's rich Gandhara school of Buddhist art that, during the 1st to 13th centuries, integrated different cultural influences from East and West,"" according to UNESCO.

"(Health.com) -- The secret to a long, healthy life in America? According to longevity researchers, it may be to act like you live somewhere else. It seems like every year another country's lifestyle is touted as the new magic bullet to cure us of obesity, heart disease, and premature death: For an unclogged heart, herd goats and down olive oil like a Mediterranean. Avoid breast cancer and live to 100 by dining on tofu Japanese-style. Stay as happy as Norwegians by hunting elk and foraging for cowberries. The places we're usually told to emulate are known as Blue Zones or Cold Spots. Blue Zones were pinpointed by explorer Dan Buettner and a team of longevity researchers and are described in his book ""The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest."" They're areas in Italy, Japan, Greece, California, and Costa Rica where the people have traditionally stayed healthy and active to age 100 or older. Similarly, Cold Spots, as identified by integrative medicine physician Daphne Miller, M.D., author of ""The Jungle Effect,"" are five areas in Mexico, Iceland, Japan, Greece, and Cameroon with low rates of ""Western"" ailments like heart disease, depression, and certain cancers. Health.com: How to live to 100 . Now I'd like to eat my way to a long life, but I'm not about to start foraging for raw plants -- I live in Brooklyn. I admire the vascular supremacy of Mediterranean folks, but I doubt I could completely replace butter with olive oil and chips with nuts. My kids would mutiny. But it's crucial that we all try, says David L. Katz, M.D., founding director of the Yale Prevention Research Center: ""The Centers for Disease Control has projected that one in three Americans will have diabetes by 2050."" Message received! So I took a look at a few key regions to see which habits we Americans could make our own. French women stay slim with petite portions . According to the best seller ""French Women Don't Get Fat"" by Mireille Guiliano, the paradox of how French women consume butter and cream without gaining can be explained in two words: portion control. They have small amounts of fresh, quality food and antioxidant-rich wine, lingering over multiple courses and savoring every bite. French women also tend to walk everywhere instead of attempting to get to the gym. ""In France, they climb stairs. Many of the buildings are older and don't have elevators,"" says Steven Jonas, M.D., professor of preventive medicine at Stony Brook University School of Medicine in New York and coauthor of ""30 Secrets of the World's Healthiest Cuisines."" Health.com: Little ways to lose big pounds . Plus, the price of gas is a lot higher, so people are motivated to walk instead of drive. All of this adds up to French women having a low incidence of heart disease and obesity (12% compared to the U.S.'s 36%). I admire the French ""food is the focus"" idea, in theory. If only I could while away the afternoon strolling from boulangerie to fromagerie. But as a working mother of two teenagers, I scramble to pull off a 30-minute meal. And that's OK, Jonas says: ""Even if it's quick, a homemade meal with whole ingredients is better than going to a restaurant with huge portions and empty calories."" Scandinavians eat farm to table . The traditional Northern European food philosophy is to eat what you -- or someone nearby -- grew or gathered. The key words are local and fresh. Native plants include cruciferous vegetables, whole grains, and berries. Northerners eat omega-3-rich fatty fish, as well as elk and game birds, which tend to be leaner than farm-raised livestock. The Nordic diet and way of life produces low rates of obesity (as low as 8%, depending on the country). Despite scarce sunlight, Icelandic and Scandinavian people actually suffer from depression less than Americans, possibly due to all those omega-3s. Health.com: SAD or just sad? 7 signs of seasonal affective disorder . In Scandinavia, there's also a physical component to producing food. ""They expend energy growing and gathering,"" explains Amy Lanou, Ph.D., a senior nutrition scientist for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington, D.C. ""But that isn't feasible in many regions in America."" If backyard gardening isn't possible for you, even a weekend apple- or berry-picking trip will connect you to your food and is a good workout to boot. The Japanese value family connections . Okinawa, a Japanese island region, is known to have the highest concentration of centenarians (people aged 100 or older) in the world. Compared to Americans, they have an 80% lower rate of breast cancer death and less than half the rate of ovarian or colon cancer deaths. They also have much lower rates of dementia and a lower risk of heart disease. How they do it: On Okinawa, they practice hara hachi bu, or eating until 80% full. A spiritual lifestyle that includes prayer and meditation seems to reduce stress -- and possibly ailments related to it. Low cancer rates are believed to be due to a high-fiber plant-based diet of rice, soy, cruciferous and sea vegetables, fruit, omega-3-rich fatty fish, and only a tiny bit of dairy and meat. Health.com: 6 cancer-fighting superfoods . Just as crucial is a sense of connection and community. ""In Blue Zones like Okinawa, there is strong social support, family bonds, and a value placed on continuing to be active in society into your 80s, 90s, and 100s,"" Buettner says. ""The sense of belonging matters for lowering stress, disease prevention, and longevity."" Good fats lead to longer lives in the Mediterranean . The much-heralded Mediterranean diet has been linked to a longer life and a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. As we've heard before, this diet includes good fats (olive oil, nuts, fish), lean proteins, antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, and a moderate amount of wine. Of course, it's all about knowing when to say basta -- enough. ""Eat like an Italian"" doesn't mean diving into a never-ending pasta bowl. Buettner adds, ""In Blue Zones like the island of Ikaria in Greece, you find extended families under one roof making family meals."" What's more, activity is a part of daily life -- ""not something to suffer through at the gym."" 7 things to do starting today . Buettner is crossing Iowa in a bus, attempting to change American towns into homegrown Blue Zones. ""More than 40% of Americans smoked in the '60s, and only 20% do now,"" he points out. ""We can turn around our diet and lifestyle, too."" One thing we Americans have going for us: We are always up for a challenge. So try these healthful Blue Zone -- and Cold Spot -- inspired ideas. Take 20% off. ""In every Blue Zone, they eat less than we do, by at least 20%,"" Buettner says. One trick for slashing portions: ""Instead of putting big platters of food at the center of the table, fill each plate at the counter,"" Buettner says. Pile on the plants. Not only are plant-based diets rich in antioxidants and other good-for-you nutrients, they're also better for your waistline. ""A plate of food in Okinawa has one-fifth the calorie density of a typical American meal,"" Buettner says. ""You can chow down for a fraction of the calories."" Buettner suggests thinking of meat as a condiment rather than the main event, and subbing in more beans, legumes, and nuts. Learn to love the foods that love you back. A diet of berries and elk or tofu and sea vegetables might seem utterly foreignâ€”but taste buds can be retrained. ""Americans love fat, salt, and sugar because that's what 9 of 10 we're used to,"" Katz says. ""But studies show that if you eat more wholesome foods, you can learn to prefer them."" An easy way to start: Search for stealth sugar, which Katz says is found in many packaged foods. ""Once you get rid of that hidden sugar, you'll start to prefer less-sweet foods,"" he notes. Sit down -- and slow down. It might be too much to cook every meal. But we can sit at a table to eat our takeout instead of scarfing it down in the car. Savor each bite as the French do; stretch your meals out for 20 whole minutes. You'll end up eating less and enjoying more. Get up. ""The longest-living people don't think of exercise as a chore,"" Buettner says. Instead, little bits of movement are a constant part of their everyday lives. Make like a French woman and take a short walk after dinner. Shovel your own snow instead of paying the kid next door; make extra trips carrying laundry up and down the stairs. Get out. Every Blue Zone is known for its strong social and family bonds. Besides spending quality time at home with family, surround yourself with healthy-living friends -- good health habits are contagious, research shows. Be sure to get involved in your community, too, whether it's at church, a gardening group, or a volunteer organization. These connections can add years to your life, Buettner says. Take it easy. Even the world's healthiest people get stressed out sometimes. What they all have, Buettner says, are daily strategies to shed stress. Meditate, go for a run, make a dinner date with your best friend -- and don't worry about your inability to be a French woman or a Greek farmer. It's OK to enjoy the occasional cheeseburger. What matters is a cumulative lifestyle pattern of enjoying healthful food, staying connected to others, and keeping yourself moving. That's how I plan to live to be 100 in the Brooklyn Blue Zone.

"(CNN) -- Digital gifts may be tough to wrap. But they can be more convenient for both givers and recipients. An album from iTunes or a Kindle e-book from Amazon have become viable gift options for shoppers, especially on the eve of a holiday or for people living far away. Digital items can be purchased with a few clicks and delivered instantly. And because they don't need to be shipped, they're environmentally friendly. Revenue from some virtual goods, including games and applications, will reach $2.9 billion next year, according to research firm Inside Network. Once you add digital music downloads, which research firm Gartner says will rake in $6.3 billion this year, and online video streaming through services such as Netflix and Hulu, the market becomes quite large. Gift cards are always a popular alternative, but for people who would rather give a specific present, many of the big digital retailers are providing ways to send downloads via e-mail. About a quarter of holiday shoppers plan to buy virtual gifts this year, according to a research report from e-commerce provider Elastic Path. Children may find themselves running to check their e-mail on Christmas morning or each night of Hanukkah. Apple: Through its iTunes program on a computer, Apple lets you give apps, music, movies and TV shows to be sent to someone's e-mail address or to be printed as a certificate at home. Click the down arrow beside the ""buy"" button on an item in the iTunes store and then click on ""Gift This."" The iTunes or App Store buttons on Apple's mobile devices also have this feature tucked at the bottom of each listing. Apple does not let shoppers send e-books as gifts via iBooks, however. Amazon: The online retailer has ""Give as a Gift"" buttons located under the ""buy"" buttons all over Kindle books and MP3 music in its store. Amazon launched the feature last holiday season. The songs are in a standard format that can be played on many music players, and the books can be viewed using the apps Amazon offers for phones, tablets and computers, as well as in a computer's Web browser. Amazon does not seem to let shoppers gift apps, like those for the new Kindle Fire tablet. But children using their parents Kindle tablets won't have a tough time racking up the charges thanks to the devices' deep integration with the Amazon store. Barnes & Noble: The bookseller's Instant Gifting covers both apps and e-books for the Nook tablets and e-readers. The retailer lets recipients exchange unwanted gifts -- say, the full ""Twilight"" series -- for store credit. Google: The computing giant sells apps, e-books, movie rentals and music downloads in the Android Market. But it does not allow customers to purchase them and have them delivered as gifts, a Google spokesman said. Others: Popular web media services, including Netflix and Pandora, sell subscriptions that can be given as gifts. Hot music streaming service Spotify offers this in parts of Europe but not yet in the United States, a spokeswoman said. So in short, stockings may be lighter this year. But inboxes may be fuller.","Amazon, Apple and Barnes & Noble let customers give e-goods as gifts .

"(CNN) -- It turns out that consumers like the idea of watching TV shows with no other ads. And, surprise, the television networks are less than thrilled. On Friday, news was continuing to emerge about a flurry of lawsuits between Dish Network, which last week released a tool to let its DVR customers do exactly that, and the major television networks. It's a battle over a new technology tool. But, in some ways, it's a microcosm of the fight for the future of television and how we watch it. ""With Dish's aggressive move to please the end customer rather than advertisers, it's clear that in the fight for TV revenue the gloves have finally come off,"" James L. McQuivey, an analyst for Forrester Research, told The New York Times. ""The fact that Dish would be willing to anger some of its most important content partners just goes to show how desperate these times we live in really are."" Two weeks ago, Dish rolled out Auto Hop, a feature for its DISH DVR that lets users who subscribe automatically skip ads while watching recorded shows. It didn't take long for the lawsuits to start flying back and forth. Fox, NBC and CBS all filed suit in federal court on Thursday, and Dish fired back with a claim of its own against the networks. The scuffle is the latest in a series of fights between traditional entertainment providers and Web-based delivery systems that can be traced back to Napster vs. Metallica and beyond. Whether it's illegal downloads (the target of the failed Stop Online Piracy Act in Congress) or DVR systems that let users quickly and easily zoom past advertising, the new-media landscape offers a host of hurdles that have left some entertainers and, by extension, entertainment companies, struggling to adapt. It's an argument that will sound familiar to those who have followed those fights. The TV networks are saying that DISH has, in effect, violated their copyrights by stripping away the traditional way they make money. ""How does Charlie Ergen expect me to produce 'CSI' without ads?"" CBS chief executive Les Moonves said this week, referring to Dish's CEO. For their part, Dish argues that people have been skipping TV ads, in one way or another, since the invention of television. Viewers have muted ads for decades, and the DVR's fast-forward function only hastened the process. ""We are giving them a feature they want and that gives them more control,"" said David Shull, Dish senior vice president of programming, in a statement. Janney Capital Markets analyst Tony Wible said the tool might not make that much difference for the typical TV watcher, though. Ad Hop's commercial-skipping powers only kick in at 1 a.m. the day after the original program airs. He says that means the overwhelming majority of DVR viewers will watch when ads are still intact. An AdWeek article that highlighted Wible's comments also noted that, according to Nielsen, 82% of broadcast TV viewing and 90% of cable viewing still takes place the day a show airs. As CNNMoney noted, this isn't the only front on which the entertainment vs. tech war is being waged. On Wednesday, several local New York stations, including the local Fox, PBS and Univision channels, filed suit against a new technology called Aereo. Aereo would allow consumers to watch and record broadcast TV online by hooking up a small antenna to an Internet connection. The broadcasters are seeking an injunction against Aereo, claiming the company is allowing consumers to bypass cable retransmission fees.","A new Dish Network tool would let viewers skip commercials .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Michele Trobaugh regrets the day she heard a radio advertisement for Dr. Jan Adams. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Jan Adams operated on the mother of rapper Kanye West the day before she died. Eager to fix breasts that weren't the same size and a rash that occurred where her breasts rubbed against her stomach, Trobaugh, then 28, went to see Adams in his office in Huntington Beach, California. She says she trusted him right away. ""I fell for his charm. I fell for his confidence,"" she says. But her surgery turned out to be a ""nightmare,"" she says. Trobaugh says that in March 2006, Adams gave her a breast augmentation, tummy tuck and liposuction -- all at one time. ""The next day I woke up fighting for every breath. It was like an elephant was sitting on my chest,"" she says. ""And when I got up to go the restroom I noticed the girdle I was wearing was soaked with fluid and blood. For days I was soaking through blankets and towels."" Trobaugh says she had three infections. She had a second surgery a few weeks later to remove fluid from her hips. Questions surrounding the death of another of Adams' patients, Donda West, mother of rapper Kanye West, have reignited Trobaugh's pain, she says. She has not sued Adams but says she may in the future. Asked to respond to Trobaugh's comments, Adams issued a statement through his publicist, Kevin Williams. ""I believe very strongly in the fundamental American principle of the right of the individual to defend himself,"" the statement said. ""Recently inaccurate and, frankly, false statements have ciruculated that require clarification. Unfortunately, it has become impossible to separate thsese statements from other professional issues. I will await my turn."" Today, Trobaugh has advice on how others can avoid becoming plastic surgery victims, and so do board-certified plastic surgeons. Make sure the surgeon is board-certified . This one, say experts, is a no-brainer. For plastic surgery, you want a doctor who's certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. It's simple: The American Board of Medical Specialties' Web site will tell you if a doctor is board-certified in plastic surgery. Why is it so important to have a board-certified surgeon? Because legally any doctor is permitted to do any procedure -- a psychiatrist could do a breast augmentation. If you use a board-certified plastic surgeon, you know he or she has completed three to five years of training in general surgery and a minimum of two to three years of training in plastic surgery, plus they have to take written and oral tests, according to Dr. Jim Stuzin, chairman-elect of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and assistant clinical professor at the University of Miami. Board-certified plastic surgeons also have to do continuing medical education and take a written test every 10 years. Check the surgeon's record . Trobaugh says she never would have gone to Adams if she'd known he had two malpractice judgments against him. She could have found that out easily by going to the Medical Board of California's Web site. Links to the Web sites of every state's medical board can be found here. Many state licensing boards, like California's, list malpractice judgments, plus any disciplinary actions by the board. (Since Trobaugh's surgery, Adams has had a third malpractice judgment against him, plus an accusation filed with the board). Ask if the surgeon has hospital privileges . Even if you're having a plastic surgery procedure at an outpatient clinic, it's worth asking where the doctor has hospital privileges, because hospitals do background checks, says Dr. Rod Rohrich, past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. ""If they don't have hospital privileges, that's a huge red flag,"" he says. Come armed with questions for the doctor . One crucial question for your potential surgeon is how often he or she does the procedure you're interested in. ""If I'm coming to you for a facelift, you'd better do it almost weekly,"" says Rohrich, who's also chairman of the department of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The Arizona Medical Board's Web site has a list of questions you can print out and bring with you to the doctor's office. For example, the medical board suggests asking whether the physician will be performing the procedure in its entirety. Be wary of multiple procedures . Trobaugh says when she went to Adams, he suggested three procedures. ""When you bundle procedures, the risk goes up,"" says Stuzin, the plastic surgeon in Miami. The more procedures you have, the more money the doctor makes. Dr. Grant Carlson, a plastic surgeon at Emory University School of Medicine, says an unethical surgeon might suggest a neck lift when someone has come in looking for just for a nose job. ""Unfortunately, money is a motivation in some people."" Perhaps the most valuable advice, Trobaugh says, is to be swayed only by objective information about the surgeon, and not by how the doctor makes you feel. ""[Adams] truly sounded like he was going to help me. He seemed like he would be truly concerned about me,"" she says. But Trobaugh says that when things didn't go well after her surgery, she was taken aback by Adams' response. ""I told him, 'I can't put my right arm down -- there's a huge lump under my arm.' I was crying,"" she says. She says he told her to take her medicine and rest and give herself time to heal. More than a year and a half after her surgery, Trobaugh says her stomach is ""concave,"" she has shooting pains in her breasts, and her ""nipples are uneven and in the wrong place."" Trobaugh says she wishes she had taken a friend or relative with her to her pre-surgical appointments with Adams. ""An aunt or my mother or some other strong female in my life might have picked up on things I didn't pick up on, or thought of questions I didn't think of,"" she says. ""And there are no stupid questions when you're about to alter yourself in some major way."" E-mail to a friend . Elizabeth Cohen is a correspondent with CNN Medical News.

"Washington (CNN) -- The remains of two men found in the wreckage of the Civil War ironclad USS Monitor 11 years ago are being laid to rest Friday in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia after an extensive but unsuccessful quest to discover the sailors' identities. In what seems like a real-life ""CSI"" episode, a military lab was able to narrow the remains' identities down to five or six men using DNA samples, facial reconstructions and bones -- but not to the individual sailors. With the measurements from the remains, examiners were able to determine scientifically the average height of the individuals and their age. One of the sailors' teeth had been worn away where he held a pipe his whole life. The researchers also had other clues like the items and clothing left with the two men, including buttons from a uniform, a gold ring, a comb, some coins and a pair of mismatched shoes. One of the sailors ""had a different shoe on his left foot than he did on his right,"" said David Krop, the conservation project manager for the Monitor. ""It is hard to explain why that is. One of the possible options is as these guys were leaving the ship the night of the sinking, it was chaotic, it was dark. Perhaps they just grabbed the nearest clothing they could find."" The Monitor's 1862 battle against the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia was perhaps the most famous naval engagement of the Civil War, signifying the end of wooden warships and the move to ironclad ones. The two ships traded point-blank shots at each other in the Battle of Hampton Roads before both withdrawing from the fight, each crew thinking the other had either been sunk or damaged enough to retire. On December 30, 1862, the Monitor was caught in a storm while being towed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Although equipped with various engines and pumps, the ship couldn't keep up with the volume of water rushing in, and it sank to the bottom with 16 sailors. The Monitor went undetected until 1973. The two crew members' remains were discovered in 2002 some 240 feet below the surface in the ship's 120-ton turret. Due to the location of the remains, it's possible the two were trying to get out through the gun turret when the ship went down. In addition to the remains in the turret, there were shoes, coats, boots and other personal items -- as if the crew members had been discarding clothing to keep from being pulled down into the water as they tried to escape. As they narrowed down the men's identities, investigators were able to eliminate African-American sailors and officers. The bones were Caucasian, and the buttons were not from officers' coats. More than 30 living descendants of the crew were to attend the Arlington burial. Because the remains are being buried as unknown, these two men will represent all 16 lost. ""The definition of family in this particular case is a little different than in a contemporary casualty loss,"" Krop said. ""They view them as their ancestors, and they are there to honor all 16."" David Alberg, superintendent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, said the burials are part of a long military tradition. ""Whether it was 150 years ago or two weeks ago in Afghanistan, the nation's commitment to bringing (its) fallen home, laying them to rest and returning them to their families stays as strong today as it ever was."" Capt. Bobbie Scholley, who led Navy dives to the wreckage, agreed. ""We needed to take all the appropriate steps necessary to recover those sailors with all the honors and dignities,"" Scholley said.","Remains of two men found in Civil War ship are being buried in Arlington National Cemetery .

"(CNN) -- What if we could use solar energy when the sun has set, or wind energy when the air is calm? Donald Sadoway is working on a way to make that happen. The professor of materials chemistry at MIT is leading an effort to develop a new kind of battery -- a ""liquid metal battery"" -- that would enable the economical storage of energy from solar, wind and other sources so that it could be used when homes and businesses need it. Sadoway's work landed him on TIME's list of the world's 100 most influential people this year and last month he was a guest on the Colbert Report. In March, he described his project in an interview with CNN after giving a talk at the TED conference in Long Beach, California. ""We need to have reliable sources of electricity. And wind and solar in harmony with a battery become reliable 24/7,"" Sadoway said. Watch Donald Sadoway's TED Talk . Describing his group's work at MIT, he said, ""We think it's a breakthrough because it addresses all of the uniquely demanding performance requirements of the grid, namely uncommonly high power, long service lifetime, but in addition, meeting the superlow price point of this application. TED.com: Using nature to grow batteries . Sadoway explained the importance of the liquid metal battery in his TED Talk this way: . ""The electricity powering the lights in this theater was generated just moments ago. Because the way things stand today, electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply. If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage, some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid, the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately. But coal plants, nuclear plants can't respond fast enough. A giant battery could. ""With a giant battery, we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today. ""You see, the battery is the key enabling device here. With it, we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn't shine. And that changes everything. Because then renewables such as wind and solar come out from the wings, here to center stage."" TED.com: Using biology to rethink the energy challenge . Inspired by the technique developed in the 19th century to produce aluminum at very low cost, Sadoway came up with the idea of using such commonly available materials as magnesium and antimony to create the battery. He co-founded a company, Ambri, to commercialize the technology. In an e-mail interview this month, Sadoway answered some questions about his work: . CNN: What makes the liquid metal battery (or LMB) better than other energy storage devices we have now? Sadoway: LMB is designed to the price point of today's electricity markets. This means it's made of earth-abundant elements and is designed to be easy to manufacture. CNN: How would this battery change our society, economically and politically? Sadoway: LMB would make today's grid more robust (less vulnerable to power failure), reduce price volatility, and make better use of existing generating assets (allowing us to install capacity to meet average demand instead of peak demand). LMB will also allow us to fully use intermittent renewables such as wind and solar. CNN: What are the dimensions of the battery and how much electricity can it store? And do you expect future generations of the technology to be smaller or to store more power? Sadoway: We are exploring various cell sizes at the moment to determine which will be most economical to manufacture. The battery (which consists of many cells) will be tailored to specific applications. For example, one variant will be the size of a 40-foot shipping container and hold 2 MWh, enough electricity to meet the daily needs of 200 American households. CNN: What stage is your research at now? Is the product commercially viable? Sadoway: Research on campus at MIT proceeds with the search for new chemistries, i.e., new alloys for the electrodes and new salt mixtures for the electrolyte. At Ambri the focus is on design, construction and testing of a first commercial prototype ready for early 2014. CNN: Who would market it and when do you think it would be on the market? Sadoway: With our first commercial prototypes delivered in 2014, we expect to ramp with partners very rapidly to widespread production and adoption across the globe. CNN: How much would a battery of this type cost? Sadoway: Ambri is aiming to deliver electricity storage without subsidies. We are focused on delivering value equal to or greater than existing alternatives such as peaking power plants as well as building out transmission lines. CNN: Who would buy it? Sadoway: We expect that over time we'll see interest in LMB technology from utilities and conventional as well as renewable project developers. Ultimately, this may extend to also include electricity consumers from large industrials to individual residences. At TED, Sadoway got enthusiastic applause when he told the audience: ""If we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation, we can't just conserve our way out; we can't just drill our way out; we can't bomb our way out.

"(CNN) -- Matthew McConaughey wasn't the only ""Dallas Buyers Club"" actor pushing his body to the limit. Co-star Jared Leto recently revealed to The Wrap that he lost 30 to 40 pounds for his role as a transsexual living with HIV in the 1980s. To get down to 114 pounds, ""I stopped eating,"" Leto said, adding that such a drastic physical change had an impact beyond the scale. ""It changes the way you walk, the way you sit, the way you think,"" the 41-year-old musician and actor said. McConaughey: First burger post-diet was as good as I hoped . But Leto, who hasn't done a film in roughly four years, has altered his appearance for previous roles, including gaining weight to play Mark David Chapman in 2007's ""Chapter 27."" As he told New York magazine's Vulture in 2012, ""it's not about the most weight I can lose, it's more to represent the character."" While fasting to portray his ""Dallas Buyers"" character Rayon, Leto said he was meditating on ""what it means to be a transsexual woman."" It looks like his hard work -- and that of co-stars McConaughey and Jennifer Garner, who portrays a physician -- paid off. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" received good reviews when it premiered over the weekend at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film, based on a true story and directed by Jean-Marc Vallee (""The Young Victoria""; ""C.R.A.Z.Y.""), stars McConaughey as a homophobic, hell-raising cowboy who refuses to accept his doctors' warnings he only has 30 days to live after being diagnosed with HIV in the mid-'80s. McConaughey lost 38 pounds to play the gaunt Woodroof, who went against the medical system and set off across international borders to round up HIV treatments. Using an entrepreneurial hustler's spirit, he then sells the treatments to those in need through his ""Dallas Buyers Club."" 'Dallas Buyers Club': Watch Matthew McConaughey's transformation . The Hollywood Reporter called the film an ""enthralling drama"" told with ""vigor and an assured light touch"" and said the star's portrayal of Woodroof is ""a full-bodied characterization that will take McConaughey's already impressive career regeneration several steps further."" The review praised Leto, too, calling him ""simply wonderful ... in the showier supporting role."" Variety also commented how well McConaughey inhabited his character, saying that ""any doubts that still exist"" about the 43-year-old star's talent will be ""permanently put to rest."" ""But McConaughey's is not the only performance of note in this riveting and surprisingly relatable true story,"" Variety said, complimenting Leto for his ""sensitive, considerate"" characterization. The industry trade predicted that ""rave reviews for both actors should draw mainstream (audiences) to one of the year's most vital and deserving indie efforts.""

"(CNN) -- Fans of ""Iron Man,"" take notice: A group of students at the Royal College of Art in London have created two masks that can give you superhuman sight and hearing. The first prototype covers the wearer's ears, mouth and nose and uses a directional microphone to give him the ability to hear an isolated sound in a noisy environment. For example, you could target a person in a crowd and clearly hear his words without the surrounding noise. The other prototype is worn over one's eyes. A camera captures video and sends it to a computer, which can apply a set of effects to it in real-time and send it back to the wearer. One can, for example, use it to see movement patterns, similar to the effects of long-exposure photography. Watch: Wearable tech tracks your life . The team behind project Eidos â€” Tim Bouckley, Millie Clive-Smith, Mi Eun Kim and Yuta Sugawara â€” see many possible applications of this technology. For example, one could use the visual mask it to analyze movement and technique in sports. In another example, concert-goers could use the hearing mask to focus on a certain performer at a concert. ""We are used to controlling the world around us to find the settings that suit us best. But while technology advances to aid this, our physical bodies remain the same. What if we had the same control over our senses? If we could adjust them in real time, what experiences would this make possible,' they ask. Read more: Digital tattoos, mind reading headphones . Though the Eidos prototypes are relatively simple, the ideas behind the project are interesting.

"(CNN) -- A Boston-area man, who was planning to kidnap children, lock them in a basement dungeon, rape and eat them, should be imprisoned for at least 27 years, federal authorities said in court documents filed this week. Geoffrey Portway pleaded guilty in May to distribution and possession of child pornography and solicitation to commit a crime of violence, according to court documents. He is scheduled to be sentenced on September 17. ""Portway has pled guilty to some of the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society,"" federal prosecutors wrote in a sentencing recommendation. But a lawyer for the 40-year-old defendant told CNN his client ""lived in a fantasy world"" and there was no evidence he harmed any child. Ex-PTA president accused of making child porn at elementary school . Portway went by the moniker ""Fat Longpig"" during his online chats, according to court documents. It was these chats that put Portway on the radar screen of police. Pretzel bag leads feds to child porn suspect in California . When his home in Worcester was searched last year, authorities found tens of thousands of computer images and videos of child pornography and 4,500 exchanges of child pornography between Portway and the people he chatted with online. The images included children being cooked and prepared to be eaten, court documents said. Those photographs are sealed. Authorities also found a locked basement, court documents show. Photos taken the day of Portway's arrest, and released by prosecutors, show a narrow wooden staircase leading downstairs to a soundproof room. It was furnished with a metal cage with a circular hole for feeding, a rusted and worn steel-topped table, as well as multiple kinds of metal bondage equipment. A child-sized coffin made of plywood was found on the floor nearby. Portway's lawyer, Richard J. Sweeney, told CNN that Tuesday's sentencing hearing will be ""the proper time to address all the issues addressed by the government."" But he added, ""There's no evidence at all of Geoffrey being involved with any child or harming any child."" ""Geoffrey lived in a fantasy world where he did live-action role playing, did things online unrelated to child porn and cannibalism. A lot of the chats that he had were, in his mind, fantasy,"" Sweeney said. ""When they went out to the other people he was talking to, these other people actually had kids they were taking photos of. Geoffrey did not have any kids he had abducted, though he certainly talked about it."" Photographs reviewed by CNN show handcuffs, rope intended for bondage, mouth gags, and castration tools. A large box of frozen raw chicken, near a handful of disposable scalpels, was photographed by investigators near two industrial-sized freezers. In the kitchen, a jug of bleach was seen by the doorway, while a red child-sized ""onesie"" lay on the countertop, amid snacks and disposable syringes. A butcher kit containing plastic gloves, multiple knives and other items was photographed in the sink. Among a DVD collection, the documents show, were titles such as ""Human Beast,"" ""Hansel and Gretel,"" ""The Real Cannibal Holocaust,"" ""The Genesis Children,"" ""Cannibal the Musical,"" and ""Cannibal Ferox,"" a film with the tagline ""Make them die slowly.""

"(CNN) -- Half the fun of Halloween is coming up with new, creative outfits that will blow your friends' minds and maybe scare a few impressionable children. (The other half, obviously, is candy.) Technology can help. Take, for example, that classic Halloween accessory, the realistic festering wound. Former NASA employee Mark Rober has created an app that shows animations of moving, oozing innards. Put your iOS or Android smartphone in a special fleshy case, add a carefully bloodied, ripped T-shirt and you have the iWound. There is also a moving eyeball outfit, and a new effect that makes it look like a hand is ripping out your guts from behind. Rober first got the idea for mixing Halloween and smartphones in 2011. Using two iPads and the FaceTime video chatting app, he strapped one tablet to his front and the other to the back. The live video feed made it look like there was a hole blasted through the center of his body. One hit YouTube video later, and Rober had found his new calling. This year, he quit his job as a mechanical engineer at NASA and started Digital Dudz, a company that makes costumes that integrate tablets and smartphones.

"(CNN) -- Mexico City, home to 20 million people, represents the paradox of the modern Mexico, the side-by-side juxtaposition -- in everything from politics to architecture -- of old and new. Turn a corner, and you'll see a church that is 300 years old. Turn another, and you can get Wi-Fi in a Starbucks. The Distrito Federal, also known as Mexico City, serves as a constant reminder that Mexicans are about maintaining tradition, except when they're sidestepping it. They're about moving forward, except when they are unable to let go of the past. They're about preserving memory, except when they have amnesia. For example, when it comes to forgiving the corrupt Institutional Revolutionary Party (also known by its initials, PRI), whose leaders brutalized the Mexican people and plundered the country for much of the 20th century, they have short memories; they recently returned the PRI to power by electing Enrique Pena Nieto to the presidency. He takes office December 1. But when it comes to the aftermath of the U.S.-Mexican war, which lasted from 1846 to 1848 and resulted in the United States seizing half of Mexico's territory -- the modern-day U.S. Southwest -- Mexicans' memories are long, and forgiveness isn't easy to find. Even after all these years, in diplomatic circles, you still hear talk of the ""sovereignty"" issue -- which, loosely defined, means the constant effort by Mexico to keep the United States from meddling in its domestic affairs and the need for the U.S. to tread lightly. News: In Mexico, Central American immigrants under fire . I went to Mexico City recently as part of a delegation of Mexican-American and American Jewish leaders organized by the Latino and Latin American Institute of the American Jewish Committee. For the global Jewish advocacy organization, the goal of the trip was to strengthen relations between Mexican-Americans and Jews in the United States. Although my grandfather was born in Chihuahua and came to the United States with his family as a boy during the Mexican Revolution, I'm hopelessly American. This is my fourth trip to Mexico City in the past 15 years, and I still feel like a foreigner. With each visit, the place reinvents itself. As becomes clear when one spends any length of time here, this beautiful city is also the place where taboos disappear -- except when they don't. A liberal island in this overwhelming Roman Catholic country, the city legalized early-term abortion in 2007 and gay marriage and single-sex adoption in 2010. Pena Nieto has even broached a topic that would have been heresy just to mention 20 years ago: amending the Mexican Constitution to allow foreign companies to enter into contracts with the Mexican government and drill for oil on land and in the Gulf of Mexico. And yet, even with all the progress and openness in Mexico over the past few years, there is still one subject that no one talks about, one that is still off-limits: race. The enduring taboo subject is skin color, whether an individual's complexion betrays an allegiance to the Spanish who conquered the Aztec empire in 1521 or the Aztecs who were conquered. It's no exaggeration to say that, in this country and especially in this city, the best, highest-paying, most important jobs often seem to go to those who, in addition to having the best education and the strongest connections, have the lightest skin. On television, in politics and in academia, you see light-skinned people. On construction sites, in police forces and in restaurant kitchens, you're more likely to find those who are dark-skinned. In the priciest neighborhoods, the homeowners have light skin, and the housekeepers are dark. Everyone knows this, and yet no one talks about it, at least not in elite circles. Nor do Mexicans seem all that eager to discuss the larger dynamic that race feeds into: the fact that this is, and has always been, a country of deep divisions. In the 100 years since the Mexican Revolution, one part of Mexico has often been at war with another: urban vs. rural, rich vs. poor and, yes, dark-skinned vs. light-skinned. It's one reason that institutions such as the economy, the political system and the social structure haven't matured as quickly as they should have, given Mexico's advantages. This country of 120 million people has ports, highways, airports and skyscrapers. It takes in billions of dollars every year in revenues from oil and natural gas, and billions more from tourism and remittances from Mexican migrants living abroad. Mexico's economy is growing faster than the U.S. economy, and investments are flowing in from Asia and Europe. It's consistently within the top three of trading partners for the United States. But what good is all that when only a small number of the population can live up to their full potential? Prejudice kills progress. The hour is late. It's time for Mexico to confront the color line and free itself of its past. Or it won't have much of a future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: In Mexico, the old and new are juxtaposed in everything .
Navarrette: Issues break down into urban vs. rural, dark-skinned vs. light-skinned .
Light-skinned Mexicans have the advantages, he says, but nobody talks about this bias .

"(CNN) -- Want to buy that bottle of Johnnie Walker Explorers Club at an airport duty-free shop abroad before your return to the United States? Maybe you've never splurged, since you don't want to place it into your checked baggage, as required for your connecting flight home. Now there's a way. The Transportation Safety Administration's 3-1-1 rule has been relaxed just a little bit starting Friday, for people coming to the United States from abroad. Travelers who buy alcohol or other liquids at those duty-free airport shops abroad can bring them into the United States on an international flight and carry them onto a connecting flight. This slight relaxing of the TSA's 3-1-1 rule affects only some people returning home to the United States from other countries. Before January 31, a traveler who purchased wine at the Paris airport duty-free shop before flying to New York and on to Omaha, Nebraska, faced a dilemma. Once he cleared U.S. Customs in New York, the TSA required him to pack any liquids into his checked luggage before clearing TSA security to fly to Nebraska. Now, the TSA will permit international travelers to carry liquids in excess of 100 mL in their carry-on baggage, ""provided they were purchased in duty-free shops and placed in secure, tamper-evident bags (STEBs),"" according to the TSA website. The liquids must be screened and cleared by TSA checkpoint security officers, utilizing the same bottled liquid scanner technology that is used to screen medically necessary liquids in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces, according to a TSA official. Just don't drink your duty-free booze on that flight to celebrate. That's still not allowed. The safest bet is still to check your liquids. That's because the agency still reserves the right to not clear your favorite drink or lotion. Liquids in metallic, opaque or ceramic bottles or other containers that cannot be scanned properly will not be allowed in carry-on luggage.","The TSA has eased up on the 3-1-1 rule, just a little .

"(CNN) -- In a new poll, Americans indicated that they support universal background checks by a margin of 91% to 8%. Even in households with guns, the margin was an overwhelming 88% to 11%. ""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone."" Did President Barack Obama say that? No, that's from an advertisement taken out by the NRA in USA Today in 1999. But a more powerful NRA today is in no mood to follow the slogan of their ""be reasonable"" ad campaign of 14 years ago. This relatively small group -- the NRA boasts that it has 4.5 million members, which is peanuts compared to the roughly 40 million AARP members -- might have the political power to pull it off. Federal law prohibits selling guns to felons or the mentally ill. Background checks are the only way to enforce that law. So, besides criminals and the insane, who could possibly oppose universal background checks? Gun manufacturers. Background checks on gun sales: How do they work? They are the ones who call the shots at the NRA, and they are the most important people in the opposition. The manufacturers don't want anything that interferes with total gun sales and profits. Background checks would impose a minor burden on gun transactions, but more importantly, limit the size of the market (and therefore, profits) in two ways. The direct loss of profit comes because closing the current gaping loophole in the background check system will shut off sales to criminals and the mentally ill who are effectively free to buy all the guns they want at gun shows and through private transactions. But there is also an indirect loss of profit: Cutting off sales to the mentally ill and criminals will reduce crime and thereby reduce the public's demand for guns for self-protection. The gun manufacturers saw gun sales plummet during the dark days of the Clinton administration when crime dropped sharply every year. The 42% drop in the murder rate from 1993 to 2000 was a nightmare for gun sellers. Nothing scares the NRA as much as a sense of calm and safety in the public. Opinion: The government wants your gun rights . What about gun owners? Do they have concerns about universal background checks? If one believes the recent poll that only 8% of the population and only 11% of those in household with guns oppose these checks, then not really. But the same poll shows that the NRA has managed to convince a lot of Americans that universal background checks might lead to gun confiscation. This, no doubt, increases some gun owners' fears. Amazingly, the poll found that in response to the question -- ""Do you believe that if there are background checks for all gun purchases, the government will or will not use that information in the future to confiscate legally owned guns?"" -- 48% said there will be confiscation. Quite frankly, this is delusional. If, when only 8% of Americans oppose the policy, you can't get a law that is designed to keep criminals and the insane from buying guns because of the power of the gun lobby, you certainly aren't going to get anything like confiscation when there would be massive opposition. Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks . Moreover, even in some unimaginable world in which you could get gun confiscation, universal background checks would make no difference -- there are about 300 million guns in America with no need to go through any background check. Confiscation would be overturned in court in any event, since it is now prohibited by the Constitution. Some gun owners presumably just don't want to be bothered by any additional regulation of guns, but background checks would be a minor inconvenience for anyone outside remote rural areas. There are also those who think background checks might expose us to tyrannous attack from our own government or perhaps even a foreign government that the U.S. military can't defeat but armed citizens could fend off. But again, putting that much confidence in arming criminals and the insane seems more than a bit strange. Despite the fact that many other countries have similar requirements (and yes, much lower rates of murder and mayhem), gun groups in our country have raised alarmist concerns about the ""logistical nightmare"" of background checks for private sales. One of my favorites was: . What is a licensed retailer to do in the event of a ""double denial"" (both the private party buyer and seller are denied). We should be so lucky to get the gun out of the hands of two illegitimate possessors. In fact, the only argument for opposing gun background checks is that you believe the U.S. is already so gun-saturated and current gun owners are so reckless about allowing access to their guns by prohibited parties, that even if they can't buy them, the criminals and insane will get their hands on guns in any event. In such a world, there is no benefit from background checks to offset the costs of running the system. I hope we are not there yet, although that would be nirvana for the NRA. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John J. Donohue.","In a new poll, 91% of Americans say they support universal background checks .

"Washington (CNN) -- While space travel still gets a lot of attention, not enough attention has been accorded to a major new expedition to the deepest point in the ocean, some 7 miles deep -- the recent journey by James Cameron, on behalf of National Geographic. The cover story of the prestigious journal Foreign Affairs lays out the ""Case for Space."" ""60 Minutes"" recently ran a story about the dire effects on Florida's space industry of scaling back our extraterrestrial endeavors. Newt Gingrich gained attention earlier this year by calling for building a permanent base on the moon. And President Obama has talked of preparing to eventually send Americans into orbit around Mars. Actually, there are very good reasons to stop spending billions of dollars on manned space missions, to explore space in ways that are safer and much less costly, and to grant much higher priority to other scientific and engineering mega-projects, the oceans in particular. The main costs of space exploration arise from the fact that we are set on sending humans, rather than robots. The reasons such efforts drive up the costs include: A human needs a return ticket, while a robot can go one way. Space vehicles for humans must be made safe, while we can risk a bunch of robots without losing sleep. Robots are much easier to feed, experience little trouble when subject to prolonged weightlessness, and are much easier to shield from radiation. And they can do most tasks humans can. British astronomer royal Martin Rees writes, ""I think that the practical case (for manned flights) gets weaker and weaker with every advance in robotics and miniaturization. It's hard to see any particular reason or purpose in going back to the moon or indeed sending people into space at all."" Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg calls manned missions ""an incredible waste of money"" and argues that ""for the cost of putting a few people on a very limited set of locations on Mars we could have dozens of unmanned, robotic missions roving all over Mars."" The main argument for using humans is a public relations one. As Neil deGrasse Tyson puts it in Foreign Affairs, ""China's latest space proclamations could conceivably produce another 'Sputnik moment' for the United States, spurring the country into action after a relatively fallow period in its space efforts."" Also, astronauts are said to inspire our youth to become scientists and explorers. However, it is far from established that we cannot achieve the same effects by making other R&D projects our main priority. Take the oceans, about which we know much less than the dark side of the moon. Ninety percent of the ocean floor has not even been charted, and while we have been to the moon, the technology to explore the ocean's floors is still being developed. For example, a permanent partially-submerged sea exploration station, called the SeaOrbiter, is currently in development. The oceans play a major role in controlling our climate. But we have not learned yet how to use them to cool us off rather than contribute to our overheating. Ocean organisms are said to hold the promise of cures for an array of diseases. An examination of the unique eyes of skate (ray fish) led to advances in combating blindness, the horseshoe crab was crucial in developing a test for bacterial contamination, and sea urchins helped in the development of test-tube fertilization. The toadfish's ability to regenerate its central nervous system is of much interest to neuroscientists. A recent Japanese study concluded that the drug eribulin, which was derived from sea sponges, is effective in combating breast, colon, and urinary cancer. Given the looming crisis of water scarcity, we badly need more efficient and less costly methods to desalinate ocean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people are expected to suffer from severe water scarcity, with that number jumping to 3.9 billion by 2050â€”well over a third of the entire global population. If the oceans do not make your heart go pitter-patter, how about engineering a bacteria that eats carbon dioxide -- and thus helps protect the world from overheating -- AND excretes fuel which will allow us to drive our cars and machines, without oil? I cannot find any evidence that people young or old, Americans or citizens of other nations, would be less impressed or less inspired with such a breakthrough than with one more set of photos of a far away galaxy or a whole Milky Way full of stars. Space enthusiasts claim that space exploration has generated major spinoffs for our life right here on Earth. Tyson quotes President Obama suggesting that the Apollo mission ""produced technologies that have improved kidney dialysis and water purification systems; sensors to test for hazardous gases; energy-saving building materials; and fire-resistant fabrics used by firefighters and soldiers,"" and adds a few more innovations to the list: ""digital imaging, implantable pacemakers, collision-avoidance systems on aircraft, precision LASIK eye surgery, and global positioning satellites."" Of course, the space environment is radically different from the one on Earth. Materials and technologies that are suited for a vacuum, zero gravity, and extreme cold and heat are not the ones we typically can use on Earth. Opinion: Gingrich's moon colony lost in the laughter . Elias Carayannis, professor of Science, Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship at The George Washington University, notes ""government agencies -- particularly those such as the National Space and Aeronautics Administration that are continually pressured to justify their activities -- tout the spin-off value of their investments in sometimes quite extravagant claims."" Products such as Velcro, Tang, and Teflon that are often cited as spinoffs of space technology did not actually result from the space program. Space promoters tell us, once every few months, that there are signs that there might be or has been water on one of the planets that might make ""life"" possible. I wonder if some of those who hear these reports interpret them to mean that we expect to find a civilization out there, one that we could ally with, say against the Chinese. What scientists are really talking about is organic material, the kind found in any compost -- not a reason to spend billions of dollars of public funds. In short, do not cry for Mars. It is not going away. We can send R2D2 to explore it and still keep a whole pile of dough for important and inspiring exploration missions right here on Earth, starting at the beach nearest you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Many voices have suggested U.S. should reinvigorate its space program .
Amitai Etzioni says there are more pressing priorities on earth than in space .
Manned missions are much less cost effective than robotic exploration, he says .

"(CNN) -- Equal Pay Day was established in 1996 by the National Committee on Pay Equity as a way to bring attention to the gender wage gap. Since women earn about three-quarters of what men earn on average, it is set to be commemorated Tuesday to symbolize that women have to work one year and a bit more than three months to earn the equivalent salary that a man earns in one year. There are a variety of causes of the gender pay gap, including differences in occupational distribution, with women tending to congregate in lower-paying occupations; differences in the accumulation of human capital; and intentional and unintentional discrimination against women. But even if we are able to magically fix the employment prospects between men and women such that none of these economic issues is a factor, we would still have one cultural issue that greatly affects the gender pay gap. Women spend a greater number of hours doing household and caregiving duties, which decreases the number of hours they can work for pay. Even for full-time workers, men worked on average 8.3 hours per day while women worked 7.8 hours per day in 2011. The differences in the daily activities that men and women perform are captured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey. The survey has 12 major categories of how we use our time, and women dominate eight of the 12 categories. In 2011, the latest year available, we see the expected gender division in time use with women spending an average of two more hours per day than men doing the activities of personal care; household chores; purchasing goods and services; caring for and helping household and nonhousehold members; organizational, civic or religious activities; telephone calls, mail and email; and other activities not classified elsewhere in the survey. How did men allocate their time? They spent an average of an additional 40 minutes per day on sports and leisure compared with women, four additional minutes on eating and drinking, two additional minutes on educational activities, and 1 hour and 16 minutes additional time working and performing work-related activities. TIME: The pay gap isn't as bad as you think . The two of the areas with the largest deficits for men were 47 fewer minutes per day on household activities and 22 fewer minutes on caring for and helping household and nonhousehold members. There is also a large difference in the share of men and women who are engaged in these activities per day: 82.5% of women versus 65% of men were engaged in household activities and 41.6% of women versus 30.4% of men were engaged in caring for and helping household and nonhousehold members. When women are not working for pay, these statistics show that they are spending relatively more time on the so-called ""second shift"" of household and caregiving activities while men are enjoying relatively more leisure time. Other than breastfeeding and lifting heavy objects, there are no household and caregiving activities that have to be defined by one's gender. It is only our cultural norm that is defining who does which task. We all only have 24 hours per day to divide amongst our various activities. To achieve greater equity, men will need to reallocate their time toward housework and caregiving activities so that women can gain more time for working for pay and leisure. However, by doing some household activities together for greater efficiency, they both can gain more time for other pursuits. Our choices for how we use our time need to be evaluated to ensure we are being equitable. Are brothers spending as much time caring for elderly parents as their sisters do? Are husbands washing and folding the clothes while their wives stay at work late to finish a project? Are fathers giving the children their baths while wives watch their favorite TV show? Do sons and daughters take turns doing certain chores so they both learn to be proficient in all household activities? Fortunately, the time use trend has been moving in the direction of more equality. In 2003, the first year of the America Time Use Survey, women spent an extra 1.42 hours performing activities in the household and caregiving categories versus 1.17 hours in 2011. Just as Equal Pay Day brings attention to the disparity in pay for men and women, it could be useful to also establish an Equal Housework Day to benchmark the progress men are making performing household and caregiving tasks. Those 1.17 more hours per day that women spend on household and caregiving activities translates to 18 days per year. So we could set January 18 as Equal Housework Day to show that it takes men over 12.5 months to do what women do in 12 months. As we achieve a cultural transformation regarding household and caregiving activities, then Equal Housework Day will eventually occur on December 31. And we would no longer need to commemorate Equal Pay Day as late as April. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anne York.","Anne York: One of the causes of pay inequity is that women spend more time on housework .

"(CNN) -- Minnesota is clamping down on triclosan, an ingredient used in some toothpastes, cosmetics, antibacterial soaps and body washes. Gov. Mark Dayton recently signed a bill legalizing a measure banning triclosan-containing products in the state. The law will go into effect January 1, 2017. ""In order to prevent the spread of infectious disease and avoidable infections and to promote best practices in sanitation, no person shall offer for retail sale in Minnesota any cleaning product that contains triclosan and is used by consumers for sanitizing or hand and body cleansing,"" the law says. The exceptions to this rule are individual products that have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for consumer use. Triclosan has been incorporated in consumer products for more than 30 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A CDC study found triclosan present in the urine of 75% of the people tested. The health effects of triclosan for humans are still unclear. Some studies suggest that the chemical could be linked to antibiotic resistance, but evidence is mixed, and the Environmental Protection Agency says more research is needed to evaluate risk. There is some evidence that long-term exposure to some ingredients in antibacterial products, including triclosan, ""could pose health risks, such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects,"" according to the FDA. Studies in rats have shown a decrease in thyroid hormones with long-term exposure to triclosan, Dr. Sandra Kweder, deputy director of the Office of New Drugs in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told CNN in December. But collecting data from humans is ""very difficult"" because the studies have to look at a long time period. The FDA announced a proposed rule in December that would require manufacturers of antibacterial hand soap and body wash to prove their products are more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of infection. If the rule goes into effect, those manufacturers also will be required to prove their products are safe for long-term use. ""Millions of Americans use antibacterial hand soap and body wash products,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Although consumers generally view these products as effective tools to help prevent the spread of germs, there is currently no evidence that they are any more effective at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water."" About 2,000 individual products contain such chemicals, health officials said. The FDA first proposed removing triclosan from certain products in 1978, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, ""but because the agency took no final action, triclosan has been found in more and more soaps."" In 2010, the NRDC said it sued the FDA to force it to issue a final rule. The new proposed rule stems from a settlement in that suit, according to the group. Most hand sanitizers have 60% alcohol or ethanol and are generally recognized as safe when water isn't available, Kweder said. However, health officials still believe washing hands with soap and water is the best method.","Triclosan ban in Minnesota goes into effect in 2017 .

"See what new techniques and ingredients Richard Blais now uses in his cooking on his new upwave show ""Cook Your Ass Off,"" premiering December 1 on HLN. (HLNTV.com) -- ""Trying to get me to cry by looking at this ugly picture? There are worse ones..."" That's how Richard Blais reacts to a photo taken 10 years ago, when Blais was almost 60 pounds overweight -- and 60 pounds heavier than he is today. ""I just really lost control of myself because I was tasting food all day long and partaking in the social aspect of our industry,"" Blais, 41, tells HLN. The acclaimed chef -- ""Top Chef: All-Stars"" winner, the owner of Trail Blais and operator of Atlanta-based restaurants The Spence and Flip Burger Boutique -- lost all that weight and kept it off, he says, by overhauling his lifestyle. WATCH: Richard Blais, in control . Working in the restaurant industry makes it easy to overindulge, he says. Imagine working a 16- to 17-hour day, tasting food all day long, cooking, talking about food, being on your feet all day but not getting any actual exercise, and just wanting a beer after a mentally draining shift. ""You get off work, it's one in the morning, you go out, talk shop, and you end up eating a whole pizza or (drinking) a whole bottle of wine,"" he says. ""You do that 60 or 70 days in a row, and I put myself in really bad shape."" In a matter of months, Blais ballooned to about 225 pounds. Love sparks a change of heart -- and mindset . Blais says his ""Aha!"" moment came when he could no longer recognize himself in the mirror. ""I don't know that I could see my toes if I looked down,"" he says. But there was another factor motivating Blais to shed pounds. Her name was Jazmin. ""What kick-started my weight loss was a combination of a really joyous thing and some massive depression: I lost a restaurant, and I found the love of my life -- my wife."" Blais gives Jazmin a lot of credit for his transformation. A competition junkie and a former personal trainer, she was (and still is) supportive and understanding; she kept him motivated on his weight-loss journey. They started running together, and today, the once-hefty chef has completed several half and full marathons. ""I had to get this pretty girl. I was this chubby guy, and I literally had to run after this girl,"" Blais says. ""She'd run two miles, I'd be sucking wind behind her, but I eventually caught (up to) her and proposed to her at the end of my first race -- a 10K, the Peachtree Road Race. And we're still together."" For Blais, exercise took priority; healthier eating and, eventually, cooking came a little later. He ""stopped eating and drinking so much in a social setting,"" which he says was easy for him. Eventually he started using healthy ingredients, such as raw oats, hemp seeds, goji berries, and cocoa nibs, which he now incorporates into his cooking at home and at his restaurants. HLN: 'Top Chef' cooks up heart-healthy meals . ""Chefs are notorious for disregarding eating healthy,"" Blais says. ""When we hear things like gluten-free, we rebel against that."" Now he says he understands the value of being aware of and embracing people's dietary needs. ""I feel like we have a public service as chefs in restaurants to provide people not only delicious food and a great experience, but also nutrition,"" Blais says. ""When you can coax flavor out of healthy ingredients and not have to rely on some of the traditional ways of making food delicious, it makes the experience better because you walk out of that restaurant and you feel good about yourself."" The secret to tasty & nutritious dishes . Blais says the secret to making food healthy and delicious is ""understanding base flavors"" and ""knowing what the dish you're trying to make healthier needs: Is it fat? Is it salt? Is it acidity?"" If you want to avoid using salt, Blais recommends adding spinach or celery, which have natural sodium in them. If you want the flavor of fat without the calories, go for mushrooms, he says. To make the patty for the Earth + Turf burger at Flip Burger Boutique, Blais mixes mushrooms in with the beef, for example. ""Those mushrooms actually give the burger a sense of fat, but there's no fat in it."" When cooking at home, Blais tries to get his two daughters, ages 5 and 3, involved in the kitchen as much as possible. ""Kids will eat anything that they make themselves,"" he says. ""Just like if they made a picture for you, they're proud to show that to you. When they're in the kitchen, even if it's just kind of fake-stirring something, they'll eat it. That's how you get your kids to eat brussels sprouts!"" HLN: Easy Final Four recipes from Richard Blais . Brussels sprouts, spinach and mushroom burgers sound great in theory, but Blais says even the most strong-willed of us can't keep that up every day. ""I don't stay away from eating bad food -- just balance. As a professional chef, I'm watching how much I'm tasting during the day. Portion control for me is a big deal,"" he tells HLN. And, of course, you can't skip the gym, even after you've achieved your weight loss goals. ""It's so hard to lose weight or to be healthy if you're not combining eating well with moving your body,"" he says. ""I don't think one can exist without the other."" Blais says a variety of exercises keeps him healthy today. Besides running, he has recently started swimming and is considering training for a triathlon. He says the key to sticking with exercise is finding something that doesn't feel like work. ""When I'm cooking, I don't feel like I have a job -- I just cook because I love to do it. When I run, I just do it because I love to do it,"" Blais says. ""So you've got to find that fitness activity that you love so much that it doesn't feel like you're going out of your way to do a job."" HLN: Chef Richard Blais on Super Bowl snacks . It took Blais almost a decade to get in shape (""It's got to be low and slow, like a good braised osso buco""), but he finally feels good in his body. Most importantly, he now feels in control again. ""It's OK to have a cheeseburger; it's OK to eat food, but it's important to have a healthy relationship with the food you eat."" Do you have a weight-loss success story to share? Tell us how you did it and you could be featured on CNN.com.","Richard Blais used to weigh 225 pounds; now he's at 165 .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Gold calls out to her three children as she takes pizza bagels out of the oven. Shai, 18 months old, runs to her high chair chanting, ""Pizza, pizza!"" Natanel, 7, comes in from another room in their Atlanta home. They join their sister, Eden, who is already at the table. Randy Gold sits down next to his son while Caroline puts food on everyone's plates. They seem like the quintessential family, in what could be any household in America. But a closer look reveals Caroline is feeding 5-year-old Eden. Eden cannot talk or walk. She needs help sitting up and doing most anything a girl her age should be doing on her own. Eden has a progressive neurological disorder called Mucolipidosis Type IV, also known as ML4. It's a rare genetic disease that is more common among Ashkenazi Jews, or people of Eastern and Central European Jewish descent. There is no treatment or cure. Eden's mental development was halted at 18 months old. She is expected to go blind by age 12. Doctors say she will not live beyond early adulthood. Eden's diagnosis was confirmed just before the Jewish New Year in September 2009. Instead of focusing on the wonderful things the next year would bring, Caroline says their family's dreams were shattered. ""Anything that we had dreamed and hoped for our family at that point was broken. Done."" ML4 is preventable. So how did this happen? Caroline and Randy struggled with that very question. Knowing that one in five Ashkenazi Jews in the United States are carriers for a genetic disease, the Golds were screened before they got married. Or so they thought. Caroline was screened for just eight of the 16 Jewish genetic diseases that were being screened for in 2004. Randy was screened for two. Proponents for standardized screening say it could have spared or prepared the Golds for what they are going through with Eden. Screening assesses a couple's reproductive risk, says Karen Arnovitz Grinzaid, a genetic counselor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. Couples who are both carriers for the same disease have a 25% chance of passing that disease onto their children. Many of these disorders are fatal, says Dr. Stephen Warren, the chair of the department of human genetics at Emory, and they can severely impact patients' quality of life. A bright future . When Randy and Caroline met, their love blossomed quickly. They dated for eight months before getting engaged and were married three months later. They didn't waste time starting a family either. Fifteen months after their walk down the aisle, they welcomed Natanel into their lives. The Golds, now a family, were living the dream. That dream included a bigger family; Eden was born two years later. But when Eden was just 3 months old, Caroline started wondering whether something was wrong with her precious little girl. She couldn't quite put her finger on it. At first Eden didn't seem to be meeting her milestones on time. Then they noticed she had low muscle tone. At 9 months, Eden started physical therapy and had surgery to correct her crossed eyes. Doctors hoped she'd have a better view of the world and everything else would fall into place. The pediatrician continued to reassure Caroline that every child develops at her own rate. At one point, Caroline was even told she should stop comparing her second child to her first and just enjoy her daughter. ""We finally decided that being told, 'She's gonna be fine' or 'Not to worry so much' just wasn't enough,"" Caroline remembers. Against their pediatrician's advice, they took Eden to a neurologist who did an MRI on her brain. Caroline and Randy hold back tears as they remember the phone call from the neurologist at 9:30 p.m. He didn't know what was wrong with their daughter, he said, but it wasn't good. ""It was more than a sad moment,"" Randy says. ""It was the beginning of what became a lot of sad moments."" The neurologist ran more tests before referring Eden to a geneticist. The geneticist thought it might be a Jewish genetic disease, but the Golds told him they had been screened. Still, when he described ML4, Randy remembers thinking he had just described Eden. They waited two agonizing weeks for the lab to confirm the diagnosis. Until screening is routine . As difficult as it was to hear the news about Eden, the Golds never ask, ""Why us?"" Instead, Randy says, ""We decided to make sure that the tragedy of Eden's story doesn't happen to another family."" They started by creating a comprehensive education program to teach doctors, rabbis and young couples in their community about the risks. Then they lobbied insurance companies and medical labs to standardize genetic screening, make it more accessible and lower the cost. Their work inspired the Marcus Foundation and Emory University School of Medicine to create JScreen, a Web-based national screening program for the 19 most common Jewish genetic diseases, including ML4, that launched this month. While it's targeted at the Jewish population, the site also offers an expanded screening panel to check for a total of 80 genetic diseases, which may be more appropriate for non-Jewish spouses of a Jewish carrier or for those who are unsure of their ancestry. There's no trip to the doctor or needle needed to draw blood. People who are interested in being screened can visit JScreen.org, read about the screening test and request a kit. A box with the saliva test is then sent to the individual's home with instructions and an envelope to return the completed kit to the lab. Approximately four weeks later, results are discussed with a genetic counselor over the phone. Additional counseling can then be scheduled with a local genetic counselor. The kit costs $99 for most people with insurance and $599 if you are uninsured. Unlike direct-to-consumer genetic testing, offered by companies such as 23andMe, JScreen is a nonprofit program with an educational component. Every request for screening is reviewed by a genetic counselor at Emory University before a kit is sent out to make sure that the patient fully understands what the results can (and cannot) tell them. Warren believes genetic testing will be part of routine medical care for every potential parent in the coming years; JScreen is just the start, he says. ""We are looking at this as a prototype to see how well we can do this for the general population."" Prevention is the goal, says Grinzaid, who is also the senior director of outreach initiatives for JScreen. ""In every ethnic group, there are diseases ... unless you have screening, you can have an affected kid."" Carrier screening programs for Jewish genetic diseases have seen success in the past, she says; in the 1970s and '80s, the fatal condition Tay-Sachs was reduced by approximately 90%. But genetics is a rapidly changing field; the human body has hundreds of thousands of genes and mutations, and new ones are being discovered. New screening tests are also being developed quickly. When the Golds were married in 2004, screening tests were available for 16 Jewish genetic diseases. Now scientists can screen for up to 19. The ability to make informed decisions . Warren says parents of children affected by these types of diseases overwhelmingly say they would have wanted to know before they became pregnant. Armed with the right knowledge, a couple may chose to avoid the risk by using alternative pregnancy paths, such as adoption or in vitro fertilization. If there's a risk, a couple could also choose to have amniocentesis or CVS testing done during pregnancy to check the fetus. The results could give the parents time to plan for the birth of a baby that will need special care. Or they may choose to end the pregnancy, says Grinzaid. Aware of their risk, Caroline and Randy Gold added a beautiful, healthy baby girl to their family last year. They used pre-implantation genetic testing and IVF to ensure their new little one would not have ML4. The Golds celebrated the Jewish New Year again last week with their three beautiful children. This year, they are hoping to encourage 7,000 people to get screened for preventable genetic diseases. ""Eden is here to save lives, and if that's what she's here to do, there is no life more noble than that,"" Randy says.","1 in 5 Ashkenazi Jews in the United States are carriers for a genetic disease .

"(CNN) -- As the reigning champion of social media, Facebook has adopted a fairly consistent strategy in dealing with upstart competitors: If you can't buy 'em, copy 'em. And it looks like the burgeoning field of anonymous sharing apps may be next. Facebook is working on a standalone app that would let users post under assumed names, according to the New York Times. That would be a major reversal of the main site's stance that users should use their real names or, at the very least, a name by which they are widely known. Facebook's 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity . According to the Times, the mobile app, which is due to be released in the next few weeks, is being developed by former team members of Branch, an app that created small personal social groups. Facebook purchased Branch in January. Over the past year or so, apps like Secret and Whisper, which let users share anonymous photos and written posts, have taken off, particularly among young users. Whisper lets users view all posts or focus on those near them, and Secret shares your posts to members of your extended online network but without revealing your identity to those friends. If Facebook is, in fact, planning to launch its own similar app, it would be keeping with an established pattern. Though it's hands-down the most popular social network with upward of 1.3 billion accounts, the service has seen upstarts chip away at its dominance, particularly with teens and 20-somethings, in recent years. Facebook bought WhatsApp, a messaging app particularly popular in countries where Facebook hasn't gained a solid foothold, this year for about $22 billion. Facebook's move you might not notice . It similarly scooped up popular photo-editing and sharing app Instagram in 2012 for a reported $1 billion. For the most part, Facebook has let those apps and some others it has purchased just keep doing what they were doing, satisfied with bringing a potential rival under the company banner. Others, like Branch, have been rolled into Facebook's larger product. But when a buyout wasn't in the cards, Facebook hasn't been shy about borrowing ideas. In January, Facebook launched Paper, a mobile app that focuses on magazine-style story reading in much the way Flipboard does. In June came Slingshot, a Snapchat-like app that lets users share photos and videos that disappear after a few seconds. And more than a few changes to Facebook's News Feed, introduced in 2006 and overhauled multiple times since then, have been perceived as an effort to behave more like Twitter. It remains to be seen how Facebook, which has aimed to be home to its users' ""real"" online persona on a Web with a host of anonymous corners, would police an anonymous app. Bullying, graphic sexual content and scam attempts have all been reported on anonymous apps. A Facebook spokeswoman said Wednesday that the company does not comment on ""rumors or speculation.""","Report says Facebook working on a Secret-like anonymous sharing app .

"(CNN) -- Keeping a sense of mystery is 2014's definition of sexy, at least according to Esquire magazine. The men's publication has named Penelope Cruz, one of Hollywood's most notoriously private stars, as this year's ""Sexiest Woman Alive."" Cruz follows in the footsteps of previous winners like Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and Rihanna. But being the newly crowned ""Sexiest Woman Alive"" hasn't made Cruz any more revealing. She has one drama, ""Ma ma,"" set to bow this year in Spain, and is filming the comedy ""Grimsby"" with Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher. The Oscar winner was tight-lipped about both projects with Esquire and was similarly elusive about her relationship with fellow actor Javier Bardem. The couple tied the knot in 2010 and now have a 3-year-old son and a 1-year-old daughter, but neither star has been eager to share details of parenthood. ""That is for us,"" Cruz explained to Esquire, adding that her family's the reason you don't often see her in the public eye. As far as her new title of ""Sexiest Woman Alive,"" Cruz was just as tight-lipped. She feels more ""like a mother who doesn't get enough sleep,"" Esquire says, than the magazine's newest title-holder. But on the other hand, ""assume a virtue, if you have it not.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Southern China is suffering from its worst outbreak of dengue fever in two decades, with 1,000 new cases of the potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease emerging each day, according to official media reports. Local health authorities in China warned the situation was ""severe,"" with six deaths and 21,527 infections recorded in Guangdong province in southern China by Sunday. Elsewhere in Asia, Malaysia and Taiwan have reported more cases and deaths in 2014 than in previous years, and Japan has seen more than 150 infections in its first outbreak of the tropical disease since 1945, according to news agency Kyodo. And a new study released this week found that dengue cases in India may be 300 times the number officially reported. The disease costs the country at least $548 million a year. Hot and cold . The outbreak in China is spreading quickly, with more than 1,000 new cases found each day last week. In some hospitals, hundreds of patients stream in daily complaining of dengue-like symptoms. ""I feel very hot on the skin, but cold inside my body,"" one man told CCTV, China's state television. The viral disease is also called ""breakbone fever"" because of the severe muscle and joint pain it causes. There's no approved vaccine or specific drug to treat dengue, which is not usually fatal but lands many victims in hospitals. Chinese authorities say recent hot and wet weather fueled the outbreak, with mosquito numbers up five fold. After a week-long national holiday, authorities are now scrambling to fumigate mosquito breeding sites with pesticide. Residents in the city of Guangzhou are being offered free mosquito repellent. The World Health Organization lists dengue fever as a ""neglected disease"" and estimates that there may be 50 to 100 million dengue infections worldwide each year. However, research published last year suggested that around 390 million people are infected each year -- more than triple the WHO's estimate. Spread by a type of of mosquito (Aedes aegypti), the disease thrives in tropical mega cities like Guangzhou thanks to rapid urbanization and population movement. Climate change is also a factor, giving rise to longer periods that infected mosquitos can survive. CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report .","Southern China is suffering from its worst outbreak of dengue fever in two decades .

"(CNN) -- The coalition is growing -- not just in words, but in action. Just over two weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama vowed ""America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat"" posed by ISIS, more than 50 countries have signed up, so far, to support the fight. They include new entrants Belgium, Denmark and Britain, which will all send fighter jets to Iraq to assist that nation's government and the United States in the anti-ISIS military campaign. Even the foreign minister of Russia -- which has butted heads repeatedly with Washington, including over whether the President of neighboring war-torn Syria needs to go -- signaled Friday his country is ready to back Iraq in fighting terrorists, ""above all the Islamic State,"" which is what ISIS calls itself. Most members of the anti-ISIS coalition have restricted their support to Iraq-focused efforts. A handful of Arab nations, however, have joined Washington in going after ISIS, from the air, in Syria. ISIS' worst nightmare: A female pilot . Why do it? Ahead of what turned out to be an overwhelming Parliament vote Friday authorizing UK air power, Prime Minister David Cameron said the world has an obligation to corral a well-funded, highly organized force known for virtually unmatched cruelty -- reviled for its ""beheadings, crucifixions, the gouging out of eyes, the use of rape as a weapon, the slaughter of children."" ""Left unchecked, we will face a terrorist caliphate on the shores of the Mediterranean and bordering a NATO member, with a declared and proven determination to attack our country and our people,"" said Cameron, referring to NATO member Turkey. Still, even as more countries agree to take part in airstrikes and helping Iraq, that doesn't mean this will be a cakewalk. No one has pledged combat troops to join Iraq's oft-maligned military or the various forces -- from moderate opposition forces to their foes in President Bashar al-Assad's military -- doing battle with ISIS in Syria. Plus, eliminating a movement of militants who can easily mingle among civilians and strike in myriad, devious ways isn't easy. Rout raises questions about Iraq's military ability to beat ISIS . That's why U.S. and British officials, including Cameron, said coalition forces need to be prepared to devote not weeks, not months, but years to the fight. As U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday: ""This is going to be a persistent and sustained campaign. And it will take time."" Expert: ISIS adapting, mixing in with civilians . It's not known if any ISIS leaders have been killed so far in airstrikes. Nor is there much evidence the group has lost a big amount of territory, much less that it is in full retreat. But that doesn't mean the air campaign -- which began in August in Iraq and a few weeks ago in Syria -- hasn't had an effect. In the Pentagon briefing Friday, Dempsey credited airstrikes with disrupting ISIS command and control activities and logistics in Syria as well as helping friendly ground forces begin to take back ground lost to the group. CNN military analyst James Reese, a retired U.S. Army special operations officer, added that the strikes have helped ""blunt the momentum of ISIS in Iraq."" Airstrikes also have disrupted ISIS safe havens on the ground, such as the northern Syrian town of Raqqa, Reese said. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters helped drive the extremists back and secure positions on the ground. Strikes have since targeted ISIS throughout the swaths it holds, and the combined efforts have stopped ISIS from swarming over Baghdad. But the group's command structure is adapting, said CNN military analyst Peter Mansoor, a retired U.S. Army colonel. It is spreading out, and its leaders are now ""mixed in with the civilian population,"" he said. ""So, it's unlikely these airstrikes have crippled ISIS,"" he said. Big questions about coalition ground partners . While Dempsey vowed he will recommend to Obama ""what it takes to destroy ISIL,"" he said the best mix of ground forces to defeat the extremist groups will be drawn from Iraqis, Kurds and moderate Syrian rebels. Some support has begun flowing to Iraq and Kurdish forces, including equipment to training. Then, of course, there's the growing international air component -- such as Denmark sending seven F-16 fighter jets, according to a spokeswoman for that country's Defense Ministry -- though new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told CNN this week that his country's ground troops aren't getting the coordinated ""air cover"" they need to advance on ISIS forces. A lack of faith right now in Iraq's military may not help, especially after ISIS overran the Iraqi Saqlawiya military base near Falluja this weekend. It wasn't just the defeat that stung, but claims from Iraqi soldiers that their pleas for backup went unanswered by military commanders for hours. Iraqi officials said they had tried to support them but failed. ""There is no leadership in the Iraqi army right now,"" said retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Francona. ""The people who are paying the price are the soldiers in the trenches."" For all these issues in Iraq, what to do on the ground in Syria may be even more complicated. It's in the midst of a more than three-year civil war, one that's seen several groups -- from ISIS to the moderate opposition that Washington supports -- spring up trying to unseat al-Assad. Here, the marshaling of an effective ground partner against ISIS terrorists has only begun. There has been no coordination, ""nor will there be,"" between Washington and al-Assad's government regarding U.S. airstrikes in Syria, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Friday. The United States hasn't shifted its approach to al-Assad, who has ""lost all legitimacy to govern,"" according to Hagel. Khorasan Group still a threat in Syria, along with ISIS . As all this is being sorted out, the violence continues. This includes fresh battles between Kurdish Syrian fighters and ISIS militants near a city on the border with Turkey. CNN's Phil Black, watching the fighting from a hillside in Turkey, reported hearing small arms and artillery fire as the Kurdish and ISIS forces fought to advance toward the Syrian city of Ayn al-Arab. Turkish Kurds gathered near the border to watch the fighting cheered whenever ISIS fighters appeared to take a hit. A resident of the city, also known as Kobani, said ISIS forces are 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) from the city and that resistance forces are running low on ammunition. ""We are hoping and waiting for any coalition air strike on these terrorists, to save our city from the barbaric attack,"" Hussein Kamal said. Coalition air power was not evident in the region. But earlier in the day, the United States did turn its air power on more ISIS targets, taking out vehicles in other parts of Syria and Iraq and destroying a command node and a checkpoint. A U.S. Defense Department official said as of 8 p.m. ET Friday -- or 3 a.m. Saturday in the Middle East -- that military operations were ongoing in both Syria and Iraq. No details were provided. ISIS has been the main target of past strikes, but not only one. The air campaign has also gone after the Khorasan Group, which consists of senior al Qaeda operatives that a U.S. senior official has said was actively plotting attacks in the United States and elsewhere in the West. The U.S. military launched eight Tomahawk missiles against Khorasan targets -- including training camps plus command and control facilities -- Tuesday west of Aleppo, Syria. The American government believes at least some senior Khorasan members survived the strikes and that they could continue plotting attacks, a U.S. government official said Friday. Added TSA Administrator John Pistole: ""I see the Khorasan Group as a very capable, determined enemy who was very much focused on doing -- getting somebody or something on a plane bound for Europe or the United States."" CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Evan Perez, Jim Acosta, Al Goodman, Adam Levine, Alla Eshchenko, Chelsea J. Carter, Holly Yan and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","NEW: Airstrikes happening in Syria and Iraq, U.S. defense official says .

"(CNN) -- There's nothing like a romantic kiss. It is the climax of every great love story and an experience that has motivated poets and musicians for thousands of years. It's also a wonderful example of a behavior that is both nature and nurture. Humans have an instinctive drive to connect through kissing, but the style and expression is shaped by our culture and personal experiences. Beneath the surface, a kiss serves as the ultimate litmus test for a relationship. It can urge us to pursue a deeper connection with someone special or act as a warning to back off when something just doesn't feel right. Science is finally beginning to unravel the mystery of how this happens. While we don't often think of them in this way, human lips are the body's most exposed erogenous zone. Packed with sensitive nerve endings, even a light brush sends a cascade of information to our brains helping us to decide whether we want to continue and what might happen next. Lip contact involves five of our 12 cranial nerves as we engage all of our senses to learn more about a partner. Electric impulses bounce between the brain, lips, tongue and skin, which can lead to the feeling of being on a natural ""high"" because of a potent cocktail of chemical messengers involved. Opinion: Why I hate Valentine's Day . A passionate kiss acts like a drug, causing us to crave the other person thanks to a neurotransmitter called dopamine. This is the same substance involved in taking illegal substances such as cocaine, which is why the novelty of a new romance can feel so addictive. Dopamine is involved in sensations of reward, making us feel intense desire that can lead to feelings of euphoria, insomnia, and loss of appetite, and it is only one actor in the great chemical ballet happening in our bodies. And then there are physical changes. A kiss can cause our blood vessels to dilate, our pulse to quicken and cheeks to flush. Our pupils grow wide, which is likely one reason that so many of us are apt to close our eyes. In other words, the body's response mirrors many of the same symptoms frequently associated with falling in love. Photos: 'French Kiss' -- Romance in Paris . But let's be honest; not every kiss leaves us wanting more. Evolutionary psychologists at The State University of New York at Albany recently reported that 59% of men and 66% of women say that they have ended a budding relationship because of a bad kiss. How is it that such a seemingly simple exchange has the power to influence attraction dramatically? We can readily describe sensations of butterflies in the stomach or feeling weak in the knees when things go well, but we are less aware of the ways that kissing helps us to make a reliable assessment of another person. An often-overlooked organ that's intimately involved in the experience is the nose. Beyond obvious mood spoilers such as poor hygiene and bad breath, we each have a distinct natural scent that appears to guide us toward choosing a partner with compatible DNA. Scientists have found that women prefer the scents of men with a complementary set of genes that code for the immune system. The benefit may be that if children come along down the line, they would be well-equipped to ward off disease. Of course, some people worry about the way that a kiss also puts us in very close proximity to another person's germs. But in reality, we're more likely to get sick by shaking hands throughout the day than by kissing. It's necessary to include one important caveat: There seems to be a rise in the number of young people biting each other to express affection. This may be due, in part, to vampires in Hollywood making the exchange look extremely good on the big screen. However, biting your loved ones is the least appropriate way to show you care because injecting potentially dangerous viruses and bacteria directly into someone's blood stream can be deadly. Blood-sucking aside, kissing allows us to cross normal social boundaries and get close enough for a reliable sample of scent, taste and possibly pheromones providing insight into long-term compatibility. In other words, there's more to a kiss than meets the lips. We may not be actively aware of all of the significant ways our bodies respond, but kisses are powerful clues to evaluate when to pursue a relationship and when to move on. Fortunately, understanding the real chemistry involved doesn't take any of the magic out of the moment, but it might boost the odds of leaving a lasting impression. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"Washington (CNN) -- An American held in Qatar in the death of his adopted daughter stood up and yelled, ""You lie! You lie!"" after a Qatari prosecutor told a court that Matthew Huang and his wife, Grace, had let their daughter starve to death. ""This court is a sham,"" Matthew Huang said after the rare dramatic outburst, evidence of his frustration at being convicted of killing his own daughter on what he and his wife say are trumped-up charges. Their best hope now may be that the U.S. government applies diplomatic pressure to free them. The couple pleaded with the U.S. government to end their two-year legal nightmare, warning that without direct American intervention, they will be falsely imprisoned once again. ""We feel kidnapped and trapped. It feels like there is no end to this,"" Matthew Huang said Monday, after the appeals court hearing ended without his release. The Huangs are appealing their conviction, which has garnered international attention and raised questions in the media about the prosecution and overall fairness of the Qatari justice system. The case puts the United States in a difficult situation with a close ally with whom it is working on hot-button issues in the Middle East. Qatar is helping the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS and is hosting many countries' forces involved in airstrikes. The Qatari government was instrumental in securing Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release from the Taliban. And the U.S. is involved in several lucrative arms deals with Qatar, one of which was announced the very day the Huangs were convicted. But the Obama administration has expressed concern about the fairness of the legal proceedings and has slowly upped the pressure on the Qatari government to resolve the case and allow the couple to return to the United States. This month, the State Department issued a statement calling on the Qatari government to ""immediately"" lift the Huangs' travel ban and bring the case to an ""expeditious and just conclusion."" And on Monday, State Department Deputy Spokesman Marie Harf urged Qatar to allow the Huangs ""to return to the United States on a humanitarian basis to be united with their children and family."" 'We have to respect the judicial process' The court set November 30 to decide whether to grant the defense request to overturn the conviction, or to grant the prosecution's request that the full sentence of up to 3 years in prison be upheld. ""One thing today did is help confirm that this is not about a legal court process and the solution is not going to come from the court. It has to come from U.S. intervention."" said Eric Volz, who heads the firm David House Agency that is assisting with the Huangs' case. Citing numerous violations of due process, Volz added that ""we have no reason to have any faith in the court system that is already broken."" Mohammed Jaham Al Kuwari, the Qatari ambassador to the United States, told CNN in an interview that his government had ""full confidence in the integrity of the Qatari justice system."" ""We understand this has a human aspect. We understand their family is waiting for them, and we sympathize with that. But we cannot deny there is a death in this case. There was a death of a little girl, and now, the case is in the court. We have to have respect in the judicial process."" Dispute about child's cause of death . When their 8-year-old daughter, Gloria, died in January 2013, the Huangs were immediately arrested and accused of starving her to death. Matthew Huang was employed in Doha by an international company working on construction projects for the 2022 World Cup. The Huangs have maintained their daughter suffered from an eating disorder. After a lengthy trial, they were convicted of endangering the life of their child. After spending a year in prison, they were released on bail in November 2013. In April, they were sentenced to another three years in prison, and they are prohibited from leaving Qatar during their appeal. U.S. officials have privately expressed confidence in the Huangs' innocence, calling the case a ""sham."" But the Obama administration has sought to exhaust all legal proceedings before seeking the Qatari government's direct intervention in the case. A United Nations official investigating the justice system in Qatar has also called attention to the Huangs' case and urged the government to send them home. A report by pathologists hired by the defense, obtained by CNN, says they found no evidence that tissue samples were taken from Gloria's body after her death, even though Qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report. Advocates for the Huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the Qatari judiciary for a formal investigation has gone unanswered. 'This place ... is not safe for Americans' At Monday's hearing, the Huangs' defense attorney attempted to cross-examine the forensic doctor about the suspicious autopsy report but was cut off by the presiding judge. ""Today's court shows a disregard and a disrespect for the call of the U.S. government for a just and judicious process,"" said Grace Huang's brother, Daniel Chin. ""This place, Qatar, is not safe for Americans."" Volz, the advocate for the Huangs, said he was surprised by the ""audacity"" of the court at Monday's hearing and fears that without direct involvement of the U.S. government, the couple has no chance of being released soon. ""They are completely depending on the U.S. movement to take aggressive action to secure their release,"" he said. U.S. officials said they continue to raise the case with the highest levels of the Qatari government. Most recently, Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the issue with the Emir of Qatar on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The officials say they are hopeful that the appeal will result in the court releasing the Huangs before November 30. But they acknowledge that if that doesn't happen, the administration will need to become more directly involved. ""We are hopeful the Qatari justice system will work, but barring that, there has to be a way to get these people home to their children,"" a senior official said. ""The Huangs have been through enough."" Al Kuwari, the Qatari ambassador, said the case is ""not a political issue"" and the government cannot interfere with the court. But he said the government did not want to let the case affect his country's ties with Washington. ""Of course we don't want this to affect our bilateral relations,"" he told CNN. ""We have to respect the integrity of the court until the decision, and then hopefully, this problem will be solved.""","An appeals court hearing ends without the release of Matthew and Grace Huang .

"(CNN) -- Passengers on a United Airlines flight from Brussels were quarantined at New Jersey's Newark airport and later released this weekend over Ebola fears that turned out to be unwarranted. In this case and that of the Ebola patient in Dallas, government and our citizens struggle to define the parameters of the sanctioned suppression of individual liberty that is the quarantine. In the modern United States, the people boast unparalleled personal freedoms. Whether enumerated in the Constitution or ""penumbral,"" the inalienable liberties of the individual are designed to never be overridden by the interests of the majority. Unless, of course, you are really, really sick. In that case, all those liberty and property rights we talk about? Yeah, not so much. Government policies of quarantine and isolation raise the classic balancing test of the rights of the individual versus the security of the people. Nearly every law or regulation can be boiled down to this analysis in one form or another. The game changer here is that with an epidemic, the potential harm to the masses is tremendous, so large that it justifies virtually any invasion of individual rights. Indeed, when one man threatens mankind itself, individual liberties go out the window, and then that window is hermetically sealed. And as long as you are not that ""one man,"" you are fine with that. Quarantine is perhaps the ultimate invasion of privacy by the state, but constitutionally, it's an authorized intrusion. Under the police power granted it by the Tenth Amendment, states can quarantine and isolate a person, property, a geographic area, and even common carriers -- which are trains, buses and airlines. Some definitions: The difference between quarantine and isolation is that isolation applies to persons who are known to be ill with the contagious disease. Quarantine applies to people exposed to a contagious disease but who may not actually be sick. The United Airlines passengers were only quarantined. The state of Texas, on the other hand, has exercised its authority to swiftly isolate Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian citizen who is ill with Ebola. Of course, Texas would prefer you use their euphemistic moniker ""control measures"". See how much less invasive that sounds than ""quarantine"" or ""isolation""? Sometimes government words can sooth government action. Of course, the authority to quarantine is not unlimited. State quarantine statutes are subject to some constitutional constraints. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require some ""due process"" before depriving citizens of constitutionally protected liberty interests. In Texas, that just means an order. Not an order obtained from a judicial or democratic process, but a form filled out by the appropriate health official and served on the persons to be isolated or quarantined. From there, the state's power to enforce these control measures is practically limitless and includes criminal penalties. There are collateral effects to quarantine and isolation. When people are confined to their homes, they are deprived of property rights and the right to earn an income. Currently only a few states have enacted laws providing any job security to quarantined employees. And Texas has no requirement that quarantined persons be reimbursed for the consequences of being isolated. Texas and other courts permit an individual to challenge his or her isolation or quarantine by a petition for a ""writ of habeas corpus,"" asking a court to declare that the quarantine law is unconstitutional or violates due process. Courts will defer to the state's police power and public health decisions unless they are ""arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable."" That doesn't mean it's without precedent: if the state cannot show good enough reason, some courts have struck down a quarantine. While the process may not overall feel very protective of individual rights, contagious diseases force a sobering realization. ""Due process"" is ultimately a fluid concept, defined by the circumstances. In this case, we balance Duncan's liberty interests against the governmental interest served by the restraints, and ask whether the measures are reasonably calculated to achieve the government's aims. With the nation whipped up into a fear over Ebola-calypse, most people will support the government's authority to impose these control measures, even when it appears undefined or limitless. But the Constitution is not the only check on the broad state authority to impose control measures. State power is ultimately limited by the people; control measures must have public support and cooperation. Isolating a single Liberian is one thing. On the other hand, quarantining a population any larger than a cul-de-sac or a passenger jet is going to require a modicum of public support. If not, then, no amount of statutory or regulatory authority can prevent a popular revolt, short of the National Guard, assuming they haven't taken ill too. The truth is, we don't ask about the limits of the quarantine power because we really don't want to have to find out. How far can Texas ""control measures"" go? More appropriately, how far will we, as citizens, allow them to go? It raises an interesting legal and moral question, one any fan of the zombie genre has wondered about: If one of our citizens is living but fatally infected, and will harm others if allowed to live out their doomed life, does the state's broad authority include authority to terminate the infected? At what point would we be comfortable with that? In the zombie movies, it's a no-brainer: generally, as soon as the group knows someone's infected, execution follows. And it's not always humane. Don't think we're above that in the real world. If the life of one threatens millions, does the state's police power authorize the pre-emptive taking of that one life? Constitution aside, the view of quarantine that we all really hold is one we won't admit to: in the case of Ebola, we endorse any suppression of the rights of the individual ... until that individual is ""me"". Then, we may all become champions of individual rights.","Danny Cevallos: People tend to think of constitutional rights as unlimited .
In fact, he says, people can be deprived of their liberties if they may carry a contagious disease .

"London (CNN)  -- The past week in London has been like living in a disaster movie. ""Escape from Peckham"" would have been an apt title on Monday as we broadcast live from the center of the riots, which saw gangs of several hundred young men and women looting shops, terrorizing by-standers and mugging news crews. We arrived on Peckham High Street in the early evening to find a scene of anarchy. The police were outnumbered and only able to hold a small side road while the mob -- emboldened by the lack of arrests -- controlled the main highway. Our crew was equipped for a war zone -- perhaps an overreaction in hindsight, but during those febrile hours, gunfire didn't seem impossible. Thugs in balaclavas patrolled the streets, menacing anyone that they saw as they helped themselves to televisions, alcohol and cash from local businesses. As we beamed the pictures around the world, we too were targeted -- bottles and bricks thrown at us in an attempt to drive us back. One journalist approached, breathlessly warning us his video camera had just been snatched by a group of about 10 young men. We soon realized the presence of the police nearby wasn't enough to stop us being targeted. As we walked back from a supermarket that we'd filmed being looted and then ""re-taken"" by police dog handlers, we were accosted by more criminals. These men, women and children were high on the intoxicating sense of anarchy that had turned a once bustling shopping area into a no-go zone. In a matter of hours they'd completely lost all fear of arrest -- it was clear to see that the looters now were in control and, for a few hours, could do anything they wanted. It sounds ridiculous, but I was as scared in Peckham as I've ever been in Afghanistan, Libya or the Ivory Coast. The crowds were skittish and moved in packs. Every so often, without warning or apparent pretext, there would be a panicked stampede. Hooded kids would run down the road as if fleeing from other looters. After several hours the police managed to re-establish order in Peckham, but by then the genie was out of the bottle. Copycat gangs were on the rampage elsewhere. We drove north into central London, seeing shops smashed on Tottenham Court Road, and then into Camden -- the bohemia of cool -- suddenly awash with gangs of masked teenagers without a policeman in sight. Then reports came in of trouble in Ealing -- a leafy suburb to the west. As we drove the radio relayed eyewitness accounts of fires burning out of control across London and beyond. We arrived in Ealing to find a car abandoned in the street, its windshield smashed, as if it had been attacked while traveling along the road. I shuddered to think what happened to its occupants. It didn't take a great leap of imagination to empathize with terrified local residents; I used to live not far from here -- and have friends who still do. Nearby, a parade of shops was smashed, bins set alight. Further on, we found burning cars, ominous sentinels marking the fault-line between ""turf"" held by the gangs and the relative sanctuary of streets controlled by the police. The fire brigade and police watched the vehicles burn, but made no attempt to extinguish them, apparently for fear of being attacked. I don't blame them -- the risk was very real. Amid all this chaos though, there were signs of civility. I met a man, Luke Metcalfe, who'd rescued a bus driver from a gang of vandals. The bus remained abandoned in the street, windows smashed, interior charred, wipers -- bent 90 degrees -- still occasionally moving in unison. The driver, Andrew Boe, spoke of the horrifying moment he saw the gang was coming for him, his bus boxed in by traffic and unable to move. He was unhurt, but profoundly traumatized by what had happened, thankful of the kind actions of a stranger who helped him to the safety. The feeling of depression and fear about what we'd seen was vivid. It felt like British society was collapsing. I wondered how on earth order would be restored and realized how fragile civilized law and order can be. In one night, it seemed we'd collectively lurched towards a precipice -- a small minority of idiots had hijacked the country. By Tuesday in London it was clear that sheer numbers of police were needed. The officers faced down the gangs with ""robust"" action -- as the Prime Minister David Cameron had called for. We watched in Canning Town as youths, some mere children, were arrested for the slightest infraction. Anyone who looked suspicious was stopped, searched and detained if there was resistance or ""back-chat."" And there was a new weapon against the mob -- the public. Fed-up with the spreading chaos, communities were taking on the role of the police, groups of men protecting businesses, mosques, temples and cafes in different parts of the city, applauding the police as they sped past to the latest flash-point. Elsewhere in Britain, though, the mayhem was just starting -- the great industrial cities of the midlands and the north were now facing the same destruction and looting quashed in London. We traveled to Birmingham, where three young British Pakistani men had been mowed down by a car and killed while trying to protect a local garage. Reports from Manchester, Nottingham and Liverpool re-enforced that this was now a nationwide phenomenon. And then as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The invisible momentum which had propelled the gangs evaporated. Perhaps idle parents suddenly took their offspring in hand, perhaps the ""game"" of destruction had become boring, perhaps the police were too visible and numerous, perhaps the community vigilantes too threatening. The debate about why it happened is already in full swing -- all I know is that, like millions of other Britons, I am relieved that it appears to be over and hope we never stare into the abyss of anarchy again.","For five nights, CNN and the world watched as riots spread across UK cities .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Much has changed in technology over the past 14 years, including Michael Dell's forecast for the industry's biggest player, Apple. The history of Apple has been a hot topic in the two weeks since the death of its co-founder Steve Jobs. One of the most repeated quotes came from the founder of Dell, a longtime Apple competitor in personal computers. At a tech conference in October 1997, Dell was asked what he would do with Apple if he were in charge of the beleaguered company. ""What would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders,"" Dell replied after some prodding. By that time, in the late 1990s, Apple was on its fourth CEO in just a few years, and Jobs had recently returned as interim CEO when the company acquired his failed education-equipment vendor called NeXT. Apple's troubles were well known within the industry, so Dell's comment, while brusque, wasn't out of line with other pundits'. ""It was on the rocks,"" Jobs said of Apple upon his return in 1997, speaking at a conference last year. ""Apple was about 90 days from going bankrupt back then in the early days, and it was much worse than I thought when I went back initially."" But as we know now, Jobs orchestrated a miraculous turnaround, taking Apple from near-bankruptcy to most valuable company by market capitalization. When asked about his famous statement on Tuesday at a conference in San Francisco, Dell paused to ponder the question as the audience laughed loudly. ""It's a great question and a great opportunity to clarify what I said,"" Dell said. ""The meaning of my answer was that I am the CEO of Dell. I don't think of being a CEO of any other company."" Dell explained that he answered the question reluctantly and that he had not thought deeply about how to turn Apple around because he would never want to run another company. ""I am not a CEO for hire,"" the Dell chief said. He then went on to shower praises on the late computer pioneer and recalled when a 16-year-old Dell first met Jobs in Texas. ""Steve will be missed and was a friend,"" he said. In January 2006, Jobs sent a companywide memo that read: ""Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today."" We'll never know how Jobs would have responded to Dell's about-face. But when an Apple employee asked the newly installed interim CEO in 1997 about Dell's original statement, according to venture capitalist and former Apple employee John Lilly, Jobs said, ""F*** Michael Dell.""","Michael Dell seems to regret a statement he made about Apple in 1997 .
Dell had once said that Apple should shut itself down .

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- The mother of the man identified by authorities as the gunman behind an elementary school massacre liked to play parlor games in a ladylike setting with neighbors, discussing their landscaping and backyard gardens in this charming exurb some 60 miles from New York City. Nancy Lanza was a personable neighbor who lived on a block of spacious houses on a crest overlooking gentle hills, acquaintances said. She and her family moved to the Sandy Hook neighborhood about 1998, raising two sons with husband Peter until the couple separated a few years ago. ""It was just a nice, normal family,"" neighbor Rhonda Cullen said Saturday, recalling a recurring neighborhood ladies night over the Bunco dice game. ""We used to joke with her that she'd do all this landscaping that no one could see because it all was in the back, and because her house was so set back,"" added Cullen. At odds with this image of New England gentility was how the Lanza household possessed a cache of weapons -- including an assault-style rifle and two handguns -- in a community prized for its stillness. Those weapons were found with Nancy Lanza's younger son, Adam, 20 -- whom three law enforcement officials said was the gunman in Friday's mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Read more: Latest developments . After gunfire at the school killed 20 children and six adults -- the second deadliest school shooting in U.S. history -- the shooter killed himself, officials said. Before Friday's rampage, authorities said, Adam Lanza killed his mother in her home in Newtown's Sandy Hook community, after which the school takes its name. Adam was living with his mother, two law enforcement sources said. The other son, Ryan, was living in New Jersey. Said Cullen, struggling to make sense of the weaponry and the carnage: ""Something doesn't add up."" Marsha Lanza, an aunt to Adam Lanza, described him as a ""quiet, nice kid,"" but he had issues with learning, she said. Her husband is brother to Adam Lanza's father. ""He was definitely the challenge of the family in that house. Every family has one,"" she told CNN affiliate WLS. ""They have one. I have one. But never in trouble with the law, never in trouble with anything."" She said Adam Lanza's mother ""battled"" with the school board and ended up having her son home-schooled. ""She had issues with school,"" said Marsha Lanza, who lives in Crystal Lake, Illinois. ""I'm not 100% certain if it was behavior or learning disabilities, but he was a very, very bright boy. He was smart."" Nancy Lanza was a giving, quiet, reserved person who grew up on a farm in New Hampshire with three siblings in a self-reliant family, Marsha Lanza said. The Lanza family is from Kingston, New Hampshire, she said. ""She didn't have to work because my brother-in-law left her very well off, very well off. She was always there for her kids,"" Marsha Lanza added, referring to Nancy Lanza's financial situation after she and her husband divorced. The gunman's mother owned guns for self-defense, the aunt said. ""She never felt threatened, or she would have said something,"" Marsha Lanza said. The aunt also said she couldn't begin to understand the mass shooting. ""Why these kids, why these innocent little kids? That just still baffles me,"" she said. ""I can't understand why."" Remembering the victims . She said she doesn't believe gun laws should be changed. ""It's the person who does the killing, not the gun,"" she said. ""I thank God every day that my kids have faith and know right from wrong -- and I'm not saying her kids didn't -- but you have got to give your kids roots."" Adam Lanza's brother, Ryan, works as a certified public account in New York, the aunt said. ""I couldn't imagine Ryan doing such a thing. He is too well-educated,"" she said. ""He has it together."" Dan Holmes, who owns a local landscaping business, said Nancy Lanza was a gun collector, and that she showed off a rifle she had recently purchased. ""She told me she'd go target shooting with her boys pretty often,"" Holmes said. But ATF Special Assistant Agent Gene Marquez said his agency ""has not been able to uncover any evidence that the mother and the son were actively engaged in going to the gun ranges, practicing marksmanship, or anything of that nature."" The three weapons found at the scene of the shooting were legally purchased by his mother, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Neighbor Gina McDade said Nancy Lanza was a ""stay-at-home mom"" and not a teacher or part-time employee of Sandy Hook Elementary, as some media reports stated. Nancy Lanza had earlier worked in finance in Boston and Connecticut, said a friend who knew her well but who didn't want her name published. Nancy Lanza had retired or was on a break from her career, but she was not a teacher, the friend said. The friend said Nancy was devoted to her sons and had been ""caring for Adam,"" but would not provide further details. Nancy Lanza's relatives say they share the nation's grief and struggle ""to comprehend the tremendous loss that we all share,"" according to a statement from James Champion, who is a police officer and brother to Nancy Lanza. ""On behalf of Nancy's mother and siblings, we reach out to the community of Newtown and express our heartfelt sorrow for the loss of innocence that has affected so many,"" said the family statement, which was read by Rockingham County, New Hampshire, Sheriff Michael Downing. That county includes the town of Kingston, where Adam Lanza's father, Peter, was raised. Peter Lanza released a statement Saturday expressing condolences to the families of victims. ""Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express how heartbroken we are. We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can,"" said the statement. Four years ago, the Lanzas' marriage was ending. Nancy Jean Lanza sued Peter John Lanza for divorce on November 24, 2008 -- three days before Thanksgiving, Connecticut court records show. The husband was known in the family as ""P.J.,"" Marsha Lanza said. Nancy Lanza checked off ""yes"" for financial disputes but ""no"" for parenting disputes, records show. They were divorced in September 2009 after an uncontested hearing, records show. Peter Lanza is tax director and vice president of taxes for GE Energy Financial Services in the New York City area, according to his resume posted on the website LinkedIn. He has been an adjunct faculty member at Northeastern University in Boston since 1995 and also teaches a partnership tax class in the master's in taxation degree program at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut, his LinkedIn page states. On LinkedIn, he wrote summaries about himself, including: ""Career dedicated to developing and refining partnership tax planning and transactional skills"" and ""Work closely with many of the preeminent partnership tax advisors in the United States on a daily basis."" Hours after the shooting Friday, a reporter with the Stamford Advocate found Peter Lanza as he pulled his blue Mini Cooper into his driveway in Stamford, Connecticut. Peter Lanza was apparently unaware that his son was behind the school massacre and his ex-wife had been killed, the newspaper reported. Peter Lanza told the reporter, ""Is there something I can do for you?"" and then declined to comment upon being told of his family's involvement in the shooting, the newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted an unidentified neighbor as saying Peter Lanza and his new wife, who has been living in the neighborhood for at least a decade, were married fairly recently. Peter Lanza was taken in for questioning, but there was no indication he would face any charges, one U.S. law enforcement official told CNN. Ryan Lanza was taken into custody for general questioning Friday from a home in Hoboken, New Jersey, according to three law enforcement officials. They did not label him a suspect. The more complicated story of Adam Lanza was still being assembled by authorities and media in the aftermath of the massacre. Authorities on Saturday said they were examining the sequence of events that led Adam Lanza to dress in what a law enforcement source said was ""black battle fatigues and a military vest,"" enter Sandy Hook Elementary and begin firing. He was named by authorities as the invader who shot to death 20 children -- ages 6 and 7 -- and six adults, then killed himself. Adam Lanza was found dead in a classroom, and police recovered three weapons from the scene: a semiautomatic .223-caliber rifle made by Bushmaster and two handguns made by Glock and Sig Sauer, a source with knowledge of the investigation said. Adam Lanza had no known criminal record, a law enforcement official said. A member of Lanza's family told investigators that he had a form of autism, according to a law enforcement official who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren has just been handed a giant political opportunity. After spending several years championing the cause of the consumer and railing against the power of big banks, the Massachusetts Democrat may be perfectly positioned to react to the revelation of secretly taped conversations within the Federal Reserve that have exposed the cozy relationship that exists between the regulators in Washington and the regulated on Wall Street. The tapes, which were made in 2012, involve examiners for the New York Federal Reserve who are heard being protective and deferential to Goldman Sachs when discussing some financial transactions that the firm had undertaken. Their actions were said to be ""legal but shady."" One of the Federal Reserve officials on the tape explains that they should not be too tough with the banks to make sure the lines of communication remain open in the future: ""We don't want to discourage Goldman from disclosing these types of things in the future and therefore maybe you know some comment that says don't mistake our inquisitiveness, and our desire to understand more about the marketplace in general, as a criticism of you as a firm necessarily."" The tapes have shocked many listeners because they reveal how weak the rules are and, even worse, how the regulators don't have much interest in being tough with the banks. Years after the horrendous financial collapse of 2008 that led to international economic havoc, Washington is not doing very much to improve the situation. There have been many critics of the Dodd-Frank legislation who have warned that the law fell short, but to actually hear these conversations has a more powerful impact. As Warren said on an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, when people listen to the tapes ""for a moment, [they] get to be the fly on the wall that watches all of it, and there it is to be exposed to everyone: the cozy relationship, the fact that the Fed is more concerned about its relationship with a 'too-big-to-fail' bank than it is with protecting the American public."" Warren, who was instrumental to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, reacted to the substance of the tape by arguing that ""the point of these tapes is that the regulators are backing off long before anyone's in court making a legal argument about whether or not they came right up to the line or they crossed over the line."" She has called for oversight hearings as soon as possible. The weakness of our regulatory system for finance is an issue that deserves attention, and it is a policy problem that attracts the interest of liberals, conservatives and moderates, all of whom have been stung by the economic toll of the financial meltdown. Anger toward the banking system is one of the few issues that provides a common thread between the disparate parts of our political world. Tea party Republicans hate the intimate connections between banking and politicians as much as do left-wing Democrats. If Warren handles oversight hearings on this problem in the right way, they could attract huge interest and really define who she is as a national politician, right as the 2016 presidential race heats up. In this case, politics and policy can work hand in hand. Given the widespread concern about this problem and Warren's skill at handling this issue, these could shape up to be hearings that have the same kind of impact as Sen. William Fulbright's classic interrogation of officials about Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam policies in 1966 or the select committee investigation of Watergate in 1973 when Sen. Sam Ervin revealed all the wrongs that Richard Nixon had committed. Right now the Democratic playing field for 2016 is more fluid than many think. While former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, assuming she runs, would be a formidable candidate and a clear frontrunner, there is also still room for another candidate to challenge her and potentially to rise to the top of the pack. While many names have been mentioned, like Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley or former Virginia Sen. James Webb, nobody other than Clinton generates the kind of excitement as does Elizabeth Warren. Clinton exposed some of her own vulnerabilities during the roll out for her book ""Hard Choices,"" and there still remains big questions as to whether Democrats will want a fresher voice, one who speaks more directly to the populist economic tradition of the party, as their candidate. While today it seems inevitable that she will be the party's nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton learned in 2008 that ""inevitable"" doesn't always cut it. Warren has said that she won't run for the presidency. But these kinds of statements rarely are the best way to predict what a candidate will actually do. The Fed tapes might prove to be the development that moves her to the front and center of the public eye. Oversight hearings would be a way to expose her to a large national audience and to demonstrate that she is deeply invested in solving the economic problems that have harmed the security of Americans and been at the heart of the laggard economic conditions that define our era. Warren has been a huge attraction on the campaign trail during the past few months, speaking about these very issues and promising to devote her time to this cause. Ever since Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy died, Democrats have not been able to find a new liberal lion to champion the progressive economic traditions that been so integral to the party since the New Deal. President Obama, who many Democrats thought would be that person, has failed to live up to expectations. He surrounded himself with economic advisors who were comfortable with the status quo and whose pragmatism pushed him away from the bolder policies that the Democratic base hoped for. Now, with the disclosure of these tapes, Warren has a very real chance to prove to Democrats that she is the new voice.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- When the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in a 5-4 ruling Thursday, the American Medical Association was quick to release a statement in support of the ""historic"" decision that will give more people access to health coverage. But (and there's always a ""but"") medical professionals across the country are wondering: When an additional 32 million Americans get medical insurance, who exactly is going to treat them? ""We've expressed some concerns before about whether or not we're going to have enough physicians out there,"" AMA President-Elect Ardis Hoven said. They have good reason to worry. When Thailand enacted the ""30-bhat scheme"" in 2002, requiring all patients to be covered by health insurance, 14 million people were added to the country's health care system. The result was longer waits at the doctor's office and complaints of subpar service. 8 countries that have universal health care . A physician shortage in the U.S. was expected even before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Now the group estimates that there will be a shortage of 63,000 doctors by 2015 and 130,600 by 2025. The shortage is a result of several factors. A large number of medical professionals are reaching retirement age, as is a large group of patients: Nearly 15 million will become eligible for Medicare in the coming years, the Association of American Medical Colleges reports. On top of that, there is a lack of residency spots available for students graduating from medical school. In 2011, more than 7,000 were left with degrees that said ""M.D."" but no place to continue their education, according to the National Residency Matching Program. Why your waiter has an M.D. Many residency spots are funded by Medicare, and there's a cap on the number a hospital can claim each year. That number, about 100,000, has remained steady since 1997. While the Affordable Care Act will redistribute some unused residency slots and increase funding for the National Health Service Corps, more needs to be done, advocates say. ""There will be real physician shortages if we don't do more to lift the residency cap,"" said Dr. Atul Grover, the Association of American Medical Colleges' chief advocacy officer, in a statement. ""People on both sides of the aisle have realized the need to train more doctors."" Opinion: We don't need more doctors . The biggest scarcity will be in primary-care physicians, Hoven said, thanks to better insurance coverage for preventative care. ""I would like to note that these are not newly appeared patients,"" she said. ""They've been in emergency rooms, for things that are not necessarily an emergency. It's going to be a reshuffling of where they get their care and when they get their care."" This, of course, is a good thing, Hoven said. Doctors will be able to detect diseases earlier and focus on wellness, which in turn might lower health care costs. But that will require more internists, ob/gyns and pediatricians -- at a time when many private practices are struggling to stay afloat financially. Nurses would be a perfect fit to handle the increase in preventative medicine practices, said registered nurse Karen Daley, president of the American Nurses Association. Nursing's holistic approach focuses on wellness and community-based health needs. Unfortunately, America has been talking about the nation's nursing shortage since the early 2000s, and the numbers haven't improved. ""We're going to be facing serious shortages unlike anything we've ever seen in the next decade,"" Daley said. The American Nurses Association was a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act, and the group wrote a brief in support of the legislation. Even if it's not a perfect law, Daley said, there are several important protections that have been put in place, protections that will give access to millions who otherwise might have avoided care. But, there's always a ""but."" ""This is going to have to be a system that, in order to be effective, is going to have to be able to meet demands for the work force. We need more resources to provide more access.""","American Medical Association expresses concern over physician shortage .

"(Real Simple) -- If your dark under-eye circles aren't quite as adorable as a panda's, you don't have to grin and bear it. Try these (en)lightening strategies to minimize them. Your plan of attack depends on the color of your circles. Look straight into a mirror in natural light, then lower your chin slightly to expose the shadows under your eyes. This way, you'll see clearly whether your circles are more blue or more brown. Blue circles . The cause: Blue circles result from oxygenated blood pooled beneath the under-eye skin. Skin here is very thin and almost transparent, so blood shows through. This is more noticeable in the morning: When we've been horizontal for a while, fluids accumulate and the veins expand to hold more blood. Real Simple: Long-lasting beauty solutions . Blue circles may get worse with age. ""As we get older, we lose subcutaneous fat, which can mask blueness below the surface of the skin,"" says dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, the director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Medical Center, in New York City. OTC treatments: There are a few options that work in different ways, though their effects last only a day at most. Topical creams with stimulating ingredients, like caffeine, can constrict blood vessels and temporarily boost circulation; potent hydrators, such as hyaluronic acid, plump the area, pushing the skin up and away from the pooled blood. Real Simple: Expert tips on hair coloring . Retinoic acid creams thicken the outer layer of the skin to conceal shadows. Another quick fix: products with stainless-steel rollerball-tip applicators. ""The cool metal causes vessels to constrict,"" says New York City dermatologist Eric Schweiger. Real Simple: Simplify your beauty routine . Professional treatments: A few other treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on the rest of the face can effectively treat under-eye circles. One noninvasive solution is a cream with a prescription-strength retinoid. Blue circles can also be significantly diminished by a treatment called Thermage, which involves a high-tech handheld radio-frequency device. It is nonsurgical, requires no downtime, and is thought to increase the production of collagen, which builds up and tightens the skin. One session costs about $1,000, and the results last three to five years. Zeichner treats dark circles by injecting a hyaluronic acid filler, such as JuvÃ©derm or Restylane, to plump the skin and hide blueness; the injections can last a year or longer and cost $700 to $900 a pop. Real Simple: 7 skin and beauty problems, solved . Brown circles . The cause: Brown circles result from hyperpigmentation, triggered by chronic eye-rubbing, sun exposure, or genetics. They are most prevalent among Asian and African American skin tones. Real Simple: How to apply makeup well . OTC treatments: Your best bet is daily use of a cream or serum spiked with a skin brightener, like soy or citrus, which can lighten circles over a period of four to six weeks. Avoid hydroquinone, a go-to lightener for sun spots and scars, as most dermatologists agree that it's too heavy-duty for the eye area. Professional treatments: As with blue circles, there are treatments dermatologists use elsewhere on the face that can also lessen the look of brown circles. They respond well to low-concentration TCA (trichloroacetic acid) peels, which exfoliate. Real Simple: How to do a natural no makeup look . Plan on spending about $100 a treatment, and you may need several over a couple of months. For enhanced results, there are lasers, like the Q-switched or Fraxel, which destroy pigment cells and even out skin tone with a beam of light energy. Most circles lighten after two or three $500 sessions. Real Simple: 6 sexy short hairstyles . Preventive measures . Reason No. 734 to wear sunscreen: It will keep circles from returning after treatment and can also stop them from developing in the first place. Sun protection prevents skin from both thinning prematurely (exposing blueness) and tanning (getting browner). Real Simple: 10 ways to score big savings at the salon .

"(CNN) -- The director of the FBI defended Friday an agent's actions in impersonating an Associated Press reporter to track down a suspect -- a tactic criticized by the news agency as ""unacceptable."" In a letter to the New York Times, FBI director James Comey said the deception had occurred in 2007, as the agency tried to solve a series of bomb threats and cyberattacks directed at a high school in the Seattle area. And he rebuffed criticism of the agency's methods, saying, ""We do use deception at times to catch crooks, but we are acting responsibly and legally."" Comey said the agency had determined that the suspect was a narcissist and so set out to snare him making use of that. The agent who posed as an AP reporter ""asked if the suspect would be willing to review a draft article about the threats and attacks, to be sure that the anonymous suspect was portrayed fairly,"" he wrote. As a result of the suspect clicking on a link relating to the fake story, the agency was able to track him down using court-authorized tools, Comey said. ""No actual story was published, and no one except the suspect interacted with the undercover 'A.P.' employee or saw the fake draft story,"" he wrote. ""Only the suspect was fooled, and it led to his arrest and the end of a frightening period for a high school."" FBI tactics 'undermine AP' However, AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll slammed the agency's tactics, according to an AP report. ""This latest revelation of how the FBI misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press doubles our concern and outrage, expressed earlier to Attorney General Eric Holder, about how the agency's unacceptable tactics undermine AP and the vital distinction between the government and the press,"" Carroll said in a statement. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press sent a letter Thursday to Comey and Holder expressing its deep concern over what it said was an ""inexcusable"" failure to comply with their own offices' guidelines on impersonation of the news media. ""The utilization of news media as a cover for delivery of electronic surveillance software is unacceptable. This practice endangers the media's credibility and creates the appearance that it is not independent of the government,"" it said. ""It undermines media organizations' ability to independently report on law enforcement. It lends itself to the appearance that media organizations are compelled to speak on behalf of the government."" 'Government disinformation' In a letter sent to the Justice Department last week, the AP requested Holder's word that the Justice Department would never again misrepresent itself as the news agency, an AP report said. The AP also asked for policies to ensure the department does not impersonate other news organizations in the future. ""The FBI both misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press and created a situation where our credibility could have been undermined on a large scale,"" AP General Counsel Karen Kaiser wrote. ""The FBI may have intended this false story as a trap for only one person. However, the individual could easily have reposted this story to social networks, distributing to thousands of people, under our name, what was essentially a piece of government disinformation."" Comey's letter said the methods used in the case were ""proper and appropriate"" under Justice Department and FBI guidelines at the time -- but acknowledged that higher approval levels would probably be needed for the use of such a technique today. ""Every undercover operation involves 'deception,' which has long been a critical tool in fighting crime,"" his letter concluded. ""The F.B.I.'s use of such techniques is subject to close oversight, both internally and by the courts that review our work.""","FBI director James Comey defends FBI agent's impersonation of an AP reporter .

"(CNN) -- Bacon and eggs. Motherhood and apple pie. Block and tackle. Image memes and Impact. Yes, like those other great combinations, there's something about a photo of Grumpy Cat complemented by a caption in the forceful sans-serif font that -- to borrow from Steve Jobs, who most assuredly was not talking about the subject -- just works. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Every time you open Facebook, every time you check Tumblr, there they are: photos of newsmakers and animals, Willy Wonka and Buzz Lightyear, accompanied by a few sardonic words in glorious, white-on-black, lightly bordered Impact. Well, why Impact? Why not Arial or Copperplate or Futura? How did this particular typeface become the default? Part of it is simple convenience, says Anthony Rotolo, a professor at Syracuse University who studies social media. Impact, which was initially created in 1965, was one of the fonts included in early Microsoft Windows operating systems. In those kludgy 1990s days, Microsoft only included a relative handful of typefaces, and Impact was ""the big, bold font people had, by default, in their Windows computers,"" says Rotolo. Given the dominance of Windows systems and the freeware Microsoft included -- MS Paint and the like -- it was a typeface shared by millions of Windows users at a time Windows had more than 90% of the PC market. Moreover, adds design consultant Sam Berlow of the Boston-based Font Bureau, it was ""Web-safe,"" compatible across the then-young World Wide Web. Microsoft had a set of ""core fonts,"" which also included Georgia, Times New Roman and the much-derided Comic Sans, which would look similar regardless of the computer you were using. All of these details led to Impact's widespread use. Boosting Impact . It wasn't long before image macros -- the graphic jokes initially passed around on bulletin boards or on e-mail -- started incorporating Impact. Richard ""Lowtax"" Kyanka, founder of the SomethingAwful.com humor site, which KnowYourMeme.com credits for coining the term ""image macro,"" remembers a distinct progression to the current look. ""Originally, people would just post images and then, in the forums, type the text beneath it (usually because they didn't have Photoshop),"" he says via e-mail. ""After more and more people started obtaining Photoshop is when the image macros really began."" That was in 2000. Initially, image macro creators used Arial or Comic Sans (""usually to insult another poster directly,"" says Kyanka) but at some point Impact came into play. ""I believe the first time the font face changed to Impact was when somebody posted an image of a very obese black woman wearing a spandex superhero outfit, and the text just said 'DAAAAMN.' After that, everybody seemed to use Impact,"" says Kyanka. Fast-forward to 2007. Software developer Eric Nakagawa was having a bad day and put out a request for funny photos. In response, a friend sent him a picture of a goofy cat from a Russian cat food commercial that had been making the rounds since at least 2003. The caption, in Impact, read, ""I can has cheezburger?"" That photo started the I Can Has Cheezburger empire -- and probably helped cement the usage of Impact, says Nakagawa, who has since moved on to other projects as an adviser. (Ben Huh now owns Cheezburger.) ""When I did Cheezburger, I'm sure we helped Impact's case,"" he says. It wasn't just the sheer popularity of that single meme, he says, though that didn't hurt. It was also by showing what didn't work. Nakagawa mentions that he followed ICanHasCheezburger.com with IHasAHotdog.com, intended to be the dog version of the cat-centric Cheezburger. IHasAHotdog initially used a wider font -- and wasn't as successful. (Of course, it also could have been the dogs.) On the other hand, FAILBlog, devoted to images of poor signage and general obliviousness, routinely used the word ""FAIL"" in all-caps Impact -- and worked. ""There are all these little nuanced things,"" says Nakagawa. ""And it's interesting how each meme has a certain look and feel. It all has to work. When we see a funny joke, there are millions of (others) that have died."" 'It's like overkill' Why Impact works is a debatable question, but the Font Bureau's Berlow points out that typefaces aren't neutral. They have personalities, he says. Sometimes they're obvious: The rounded, bulbous font used by Dunkin' Donuts suggests cheerfulness (and doughnuts), for example. Comic Sans, as Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert learned to his dismay, signifies cutesiness (at best). On the other hand, Helvetica is a subtle font, often used by brands ""to make them feel like they are the standard-bearer of simple,"" says Berlow. Impact, on its face, suggests boldness, loudness and yelling, especially in all-caps -- ""it's like overkill,"" says Henry Hongmin Kim, a graphic design professor at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Combine that with photos of cats or Willy Wonka, and the contrast provokes at least a smile. (Indeed, Impact is even more effective with a 1-pixel outline or drop shadow, says Nakagawa.) The look has now become an established template, with such sites as Imgflip.com, Memegenerator.net and Cheezburger's Builder making such memes automatic. Just find an image, add a punchy phrase in Impact and you're there. The look helps us recognize the whole package as a meme, says Syracuse's Rotolo. It's a shorthand for comedy, which is useful, because the impact -- pardon the pun -- is ephemeral, he adds. ""Memes are about being in the moment,"" he says. ""Making a meme has to be fast and has to be pertinent."" Whether Impact lasts for memes is anybody's guess. Berlow observes that the requirements that once made it obligatory -- its convenience and commonality -- are fading, now that anybody with a font editing application can create their very own looks. His own company has created several fonts that have the same metrics as Impact. But, for now, it's not going anywhere. ""For the most part the template will stick,"" says Rotolo. ""There will certainly be new types of memes and there will certainly be new templates that will come from new apps that make image-sharing easier. But I think what most people are looking for is the content and the context, so the meme template is going to prevail for some time.""","Most image memes use the font Impact .
Impact was one of Windows' ""Web-safe"" fonts, easily accessed in Web's early days .
Its forcefulness gives irony to goofy pictures, provides instant comedy ."
"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Amid increasing optimism that a deal could be within reach, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is heading to Geneva to help in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. Kerry will fly to Geneva on Friday ""in an effort to help narrow differences in negotiations"" with Iran, two senior State Department officials said. European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton invited Kerry to the talks, the officials said. News of Kerry's travel plans came hours after Iran's foreign minister said that officials could reach an agreement by Friday evening. ""I believe it is possible to reach an understanding or an agreement before we close these negotiations (Friday) evening,"" Iran's foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator, Javad Zarif, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Though he would not detail what such an agreement could include, he told the state-run Iranian News Agency, ""We expect to make a breakthrough."" U.S. President Barack Obama also said Thursday night that a deal could be reached. There is the ""possibility of a phased agreement"" with Iran on nuclear issues, Obama told NBC. The first step, if agreed upon, would require Iran to halt advances in its nuclear program in return for ""very modest relief"" from economic sanctions, he said. But the United States would still keep ""core sanctions"" in place, Obama said. ""So that if it turned out during the course of the six months when we're trying to resolve some of these bigger issues that they're backing out of the deal, they're not following through on it, or they're not willing to go forward and finish the job of giving us assurances that they're not developing a nuclear weapon,"" Obama told NBC, ""we can crank that dial back up."" The comments came after a day of meetings in Geneva between Iranian negotiators and technical teams from the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and non-nuclear-armed Germany -- a group referred to as the P5+1 or EU3+3. Uranium enrichment is the key issue on the table during the talks with Iran over the future of its controversial nuclear program. ""We are at a very sensitive stage of negotiations, and it is best if these negotiations are done at the negotiating table rather than on live television,"" Zarif said. ""But I can tell you that we are prepared to address some of the most immediate concerns that have been raised, and we expect reciprocally our concerns to be met by the P5+1."" Iranian negotiator: Various issues on the table . The framework has been agreed to, he said. ""I hope by tomorrow morning we can start serious work in order to prepare some sort of a joint statement."" It would address an end game ""that we all try to reach within a limited period of time, hopefully in less than a year"" and a series of actions that both sides would take reciprocally ""in order to build confidence and address the most immediate concerns,"" he said. Many of those concerns center on Iran's nuclear ambitions, which some countries worry seek a nuclear weapon, an assertion that Tehran has denied. Zarif said the nuclear program would continue -- in some form. ""There won't be a suspension of our enrichment program in its entirety,"" he said. ""But we can deal with various issues, various issues are on the table."" The concerns of each side have been dealt with, he said. Zarif said Hassan Rouhani's assumption of the presidency in August has opened a window of opportunity that needs to be seized. He acknowledged that international sanctions have resulted in economic hardship for Iranians, but said they represent a failed policy. ""Instead of 160 centrifuges that were spinning 10 years ago or eight years ago, today we have 19,000 centrifuges,"" he said. ""So that is what sanctions and pressures and intimidation has brought these people who are continuing to advocate that type of behavior."" U.S. officials outline possible deal . Two senior U.S. administration officials said a deal on Iran's nuclear program is in the works. One of the officials said the deal is designed to ""stop Iran's progress by stopping the shortening of time by which they could build a nuclear weapon"" while also providing temporary, reversible sanctions relief to Iran. That official cautioned the deal is not done, but said it could happen if the Iranians agree to the P5+1's demands. They said that, under the potential deal, Iran would agree: . -- to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20% purity; . -- to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel; . -- to agree not to use advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges; . -- not to activate a plutonium reactor at Arak. In turn, the P5+1 would agree: . -- to unfreeze some Iranian assets held in banks overseas; . -- possibly to consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals. Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said. The officials added that the measures could be reimposed if Iran did not comply with its end of any bargain. 'Getting to the root of the problem' The details were hashed out during a bilateral U.S.-Iran meeting -- part of an apparent effort on each side to mend fences -- which lasted about an hour on the sidelines of broader talks under way in Geneva. The U.S. delegation was led by Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. The Iranian delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. Iran talks: Do we want a deal or a war? ""The main issue is getting to the root of the problem, which is the enrichment issue and all things that lead from that,"" Michael Mann, spokesman for Ashton, said on the sidelines of negotiations. Iran's supreme leader 'not optimistic' about nuclear talks . Moments later, the Iranian state-run Fars News Agency tweeted a quote from Araqchi: ""Enrichment is our red line and its suspension is unacceptable."" When CNN asked Araqchi about the issue of uranium enrichment, he declined to answer. ""The talks are extremely complex and are now going into a serious phase,"" Mann said. ""We want to focus on substance and hope there will be concrete progress over the next couple of days."" U.N. nuclear watchdog: Program could have 'military dimensions' U.S. official: We think Iran wants a nuclear deal -- and fast . The United States and its partners have accused Iran of diverting resources from its civilian nuclear program to try to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran has repeatedly denied those assertions and says it has no desire to build nuclear weapons. Resolutions and sanctions passed by the United Nations in 2006 called on Iran to halt all enrichment activities and clarify that its nuclear facilities were being used for peaceful purposes only. In its August report, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, estimates that since declaring its nuclear program, Iran has processed 10 metric tons of uranium to 5% purity, the level used for nuclear power plants. The IAEA estimates that Iran has a stockpile of 185 kilograms of uranium at 20% purity. Weapons experts warn that this uranium could be further refined for use in a nuclear warhead. Although experts suggest that amount would not be enough for a single warhead, the IAEA has warned that it believes Iran's nuclear program could have ""possible military dimensions.""

"(CNN) -- With a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze-your-North-Face-off in the Andes, Peru packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation Pacific beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain, Nevado Huascaran. There's pisco. There's ceviche. And, yes, there's that famous trail. Don't worry, we'll get to all of those. First some things you may not already know. Peruvian food: From guinea pigs to pisco sours . 1. Lima is worth seeing . While most international travelers land in Peru's current capital, many immediately continue on to the country's former capital, Cuzco, in their rush to get to Machu Picchu. That's a mistake. Lima is Peru's largest city by far. It's home to more than a quarter of Peru's roughly 30 million people, has wonderful food, the beautiful Miraflores district (where you can drink while overlooking beaches lined with small rocks that form eye-catching patterns each time the tide rolls out) and excellent museums. The Museo Larco and its Erotic Gallery is devoted to sculptures from more than a thousand years ago celebrating sexual congress in all of its least procreative forms. Reproductions of these works pop up all over Peru, notably in the form of a bottle of pisco shaped like a fellow in an extremely good mood. Museo Larco (Larco Museum), Bolivar 1515, Lima; +51 1 461 1312 . 2. You're gonna love the ceviche . Fresh, raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chili peppers and sometimes other tongue-tingling spices, ceviche is Peru's most popular dish, a must-try for any visitor. In Lima, internationally famed La Mar is a great place to try it, but ceviche is prepared differently throughout the country, from humble street stalls to elegant restaurants. La Mar, 770 Av. La Mar, Lima; +51 1 421 3365 . 3. There's more to Peru than Incas . Most tourists come to Peru to see Machu Picchu or other Inca ruins, with maybe a few Catholic churches thrown in for balance. This makes it easy to conclude, ""There were the Incas, then the Spanish came, which brings us to where we are now."" In fact, the Inca were a bit like Mitt Romney's Bain Capital: They had a knack for taking control of long-established things and making them their own. The Incan state didn't emerge until the 1200s. It became an empire in the 1400s, and its final sovereign emperor died in 1533, officially ending the period of constructing the buildings and roads that lure visitors to this day. That said, the Norte Chico people of Peru built a civilization 5,000 years ago and the centuries that followed saw the emergence of other significant cultures, such as the Paracas and the Moche. Was the Incan era a highlight of Peruvian history? Unquestionably. But when Peruvian museums boast artifacts from before Christ, focusing exclusively on Atahualpa and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the Gutenberg press. 4. Pisco rules . Peru's beverage of choice is pisco, a brandy made from grapes. It's also adored in Chile, inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace. Available in numerous brands at varying prices, pisco is usually consumed in cocktail form, meaning other ingredients largely hide its nuances, which can be a good thing for novices unaccustomed to pisco's blowtorch nuances. The most famous cocktail is the pisco sour, consisting of lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, ice and Angostura bitters. There are assorted variations, such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness. If you'd rather just have a beer, you're in luck -- the local brews are good, with CusqueÃ±a being a particularly refreshing option. 5. Cash is king, ideally in small bills . Travelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that won't take MasterCard or Visa, much less American Express. Peru offers an extra twist: occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them. In general, Peruvians like their soles (the currency is the nuevo sol) in small denominations: a fifty (roughly $20) is OK, but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change. That noted, Peruvians tend to put great stock in U.S. dollars, so even if an establishment doesn't take credit cards and you don't see an ATM, you may still be able to buy dinner or souvenirs. Make sure your U.S. and other foreign currency is in pristine shape -- many merchants and hotels will reject torn or overly worn bills. 6. Altitude adjustment amounts to common sense . Peru is a mountainous land, and you have to handle heights if you're going to Cuzco, Machu Picchu and other landmarks of Incan culture. How to prepare? The easiest method is drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep and ease off the booze -- just imagine how your mother would like you to conduct your life at every elevation and you'll be fine. You can also consume stimulating coca leafs, whether in tea or by chewing them. 7. The plumbing requires some TLC . Expect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet. While Peruvian plumbing handles your waste, it doesn't do toilet paper, which must be put in the bin next to the bowl. Some bathrooms have signs stating this rule, others assume you know: remember and spare yourself begging for a plunger in broken Spanish. 8. The Inca Trail is genuinely difficult . Along the famed trail you'll often be reminded of the Peruvian proverb: ""When the road is long, even slippers feel tight."" The Inca Trail largely consists of stone stairs -- often steep ones -- and those stone stairs weren't meant to be covered by mortals. The result is that the steps feel quite high for those who don't answer to ""Kobe"" or ""LeBron."" If just reading this makes your knees swell, you may be in trouble. In addition, while altitude sickness tends to be exaggerated, there'll come a moment when you're going up a hill and find that your lungs have betrayed you. Throw in the chance of heavy rains -- test your ""waterproof"" gear pretrek to make sure it's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp. 9. There are ways to ease your Inca pain . Depending on the company guiding you on the Trail, it's possible to get porters to carry your tent, sleeping bag, food and ... well, they'll essentially carry everything, including you, should your body completely fall to pieces. Porters race ahead to the night's camp and assemble everything before parties arrive, then cook and serve multiple-course meals, in certain cases on white linen table clothes. The result after a hard day's walk is that you feel like you've stepped out of ""Deliverance"" and into ""Howard's End."" Speaking of porters ... 10. Porters are the toughest guys in the country . Whether you're on your own or traveling like an English lord in the colonies, you'll encounter porters on the Inca Trail. These men tend to be farmers or laborers looking to earn extra money. They carry up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of gear -- the weight limit is a recent development, they used to handle positively spine-shattering loads -- and they carry it fast. Some actually run along the trail, somehow avoiding shredded ankles as they navigate uneven, wet stones just to ensure all's ready before the tourists stagger into camp. If you feel like racing your fellow hikers, great. Do not test the porters: They're pros, and you're at best a promising amateur.","The country of some 30 million is incredibly diverse .
Take the time to visit Lima, the nation's capital and largest city .
Pisco, a brandy made from grapes, is the national libation .
The famed Inca Trail isn't recommended for novice hikers -- it's tough ."
"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Bangladesh hanged an Islamist leader Thursday despite pleas not to from the United Nations. The execution came after the country's Supreme Court upheld the death sentence against Abdul Quader Mollah, state-run news agency BSS reported. Mollah was sentenced in September after being convicted of crimes against humanity that date back to 1971, during the country's war for independence. The execution, originally scheduled for Tuesday, was delayed by the Supreme Court at the last minute. Mollah was the assistant secretary general for the Jamaat-e-Islami party, which earlier this year was banned from taking part in elections. Court decisions in his case, and others against senior Jamaat leaders have resulted in violent protests in the streets. In February, he was convicted of war crimes by an international panel set up by the government in an attempt to bring to justice those accused of atrocities. He was originally sentenced to life in prison, but many Bangladeshis held protests saying the sentence wasn't harsh enough. The Supreme Court then sentenced him to death. In the country's legal system, that decision cannot be appealed. Concerns over trial . Two U.N. human rights experts called on Bangladesh on Monday to halt the execution because of concerns that Mollah did not receive a fair trial. ""The right of appeal is of particular importance in death penalty cases,"" said Gabriela Knaul, U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. ""Anyone convicted of a crime has the right to have his or her conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal, as laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Bangladesh is a party,"" she said in a statement. ""This provision is violated where a court of final instance imposes a harsher sentence that cannot be reviewed,"" the statement said. Christof Heyns, U.N. special rapporteur on summary executions, said capital punishment ""may be imposed only following a trial that complied with fair trial and due process safeguards. ... Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as possibly permitted under international law from a summary execution, which by definition violates human rights standards."" On Tuesday, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for a stay, saying the trial had not met stringent international standards for the death penalty, the U.N. said in a statement. The United Nations opposes the death penalty in any circumstance. Political tensions . Jamaat, a major ally of the main opposition party Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is a constant thorn in the side of the ruling Awami League. Jaamat enjoys considerable support, particularly in rural areas. And periodically, it mobilizes its adherents in large-scale demonstrations in Dhaka to show its strength. But it has faced pressure from the Awami League and progressive groups that point to Jammat's role during Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan. Between 1 million and 3 million people were killed in the nine-month war. The International Crimes Tribunal, the court set up by the government in 2010, has convicted several other top Jamaat leaders of crimes against humanity. Jamaat acknowledges that it opposed Bangladesh's struggle for independence, but it has decried what it calls a smear campaign against it. It has also questioned why the Awami League is only now pressing forward on war crimes trials when it didn't do so while in power during the 1970s and 1990s.","NEW: Abdul Quader Mollah was hanged Thursday, state media reported .
But the court postponed the execution shortly before it was to take place .
After further hearings, it has now said the hanging can go ahead .

"(CNN) -- Beauty queen Monica Spear posted scenic photos and videos of the Venezuelan countryside online in the days before her death. Now, days after attackers gunned down the soap opera star and her ex-husband, investigators say Spear's camera was a key link that helped them track down her killers. Police found the camera inside the home of one of seven suspects authorities have arrested in connection with the slayings, the head of Venezuela's national crime investigation agency said Thursday. Four suspects are still on the loose, he said. No one has been charged, but officials say there is evidence linking the group of suspected gang members to the double homicide. The high-profile case has galvanized Venezuelans to turn up the pressure on their government to act on the country's high crime rates and prompted pledges from officials to end the violence. The victims' 5-year-old daughter, Maya, witnessed the roadside shooting and suffered a gunshot wound herself but survived. ""It's terrible that this happened, and society has to react,"" Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said at a security meeting he convened with mayors and governors on Wednesday. ""It is not time to faint, to throw in the towel, to let our guard down. To the contrary, it's time to react."" For many Venezuelans, what happened to Spear is nothing new. Violence on Venezuelan roads and highways, they say, is all too common. A nonprofit that tracks homicides in the South American country says there were almost 25,000 violent deaths last year in the country of about 30 million people. ""I ask Venezuelans to wake up because it was Monica a few days ago, but, how many people have died on highways in this country?"" said Mary Spear, the soap opera star's aunt. ""Monica had to die so that the whole world learns that we can't be out on the street because we're afraid."" Investigators believe motive was robbery . The head of Venezuela's national crime investigation agency said Thursday that investigators believe robbery was the motive in the attack. But during Wednesday's meeting, Maduro theorized that the killings may not have been a robbery or a normal street crime. ""This murder seems more like a contract killing,"" he said. The president did not elaborate on his statement. Four men, a woman and two minors with ties to the crime have been arrested. Four other suspects remain on the loose, including the man believed to have the murder weapon, said Jose Gregorio Sierralta, director of the Corps of Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigations. ""We have managed to apprehend and totally break up this dangerous gang,"" he said. Sierralta stressed that dealing with violence is not just the government's responsibility. ""Crime is everyone's problem,"" he said. ""We cannot distance ourselves from this reality. ... We must reflect on each case as parents, as professionals. What are Venezuelans doing to help to solve these expressions of criminality that are so strong that have been affecting us in recent months?"" Grandfather: 5-year-old still has bullet lodged in leg . Throngs of mourners have come to the Caracas funeral home to pay respects to Spear. A funeral for the actress is set for Friday. Spear was Miss Venezuela in 2004 and represented her country in the Miss Universe pageant the next year. Her popularity opened the door to acting roles in soap operas that eventually made her an international star. Spear, who studied theater at the University of Central Florida before winning the Miss Venezuela crown, appeared on the Telemundo soap operas ""Flor Salvaje"" (Savage Flower) and ""Pasion Prohibida"" (Forbidden Passion). The actress's daughter, Maya, was released from the hospital and is with family. The girl still has a bullet lodged in her leg, but doctors expect her to recover, said Rafael Spear, Monica Spear's father and the child's grandfather. ""She has not yet asked about her parents. I think she knows what happened,"" he told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Thursday. ""It's something that's going to come up sooner rather than later."" The family has reached out to psychologists about how to handle the situation, her brother, Ricardo Spear, told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""We're going to do it slowly. We're going to use metaphors: They went to heaven; they're up there watching you; they're taking care of you; they love you,"" he said. The Spear family is not one to hold on to anger, the brother said, and has nothing to say to whoever ended Monica Spear's life. Family members are filled with sadness but hope that something good can come from the tragedy, he said. ""We're not focusing on police agencies or information about how this happened,"" he said. ""We're focusing on spreading a message of peace, a message of love."" Venezuela is one of the world's most violent countries, according to a United Nations ranking. One person is killed roughly every 21 minutes in Venezuela. And there were 24,700 violent deaths last year in the oil-rich country of roughly 30 million people, according to the nonprofit Venezuelan Violence Observatory. The observatory says the country's murder rate has soared to nearly 80 deaths per 100,000 people. Government statistics put the figure significantly lower, at 39 deaths per 100,000. Even though she was also an American citizen, Spear loved traveling through Venezuela and exploring the country and wanted to see the security situation improve, Rafael Spear said. ""Monica was in love with Venezuela ... What happened should never happen to anyone else in this beautiful country,"" Rafael Spear said. ""We must work together to make the country safe. We must disarm the people. We must make it so we can go out at night, like we did before."" CNN's Patricia Janiot, Rafael Romo and Alejandra Oraa contributed to this report.","NEW: Monica Spear's daughter still has a bullet lodged in her leg, family says .

"(CNN) -- Anwar al-Awlaki was killed exactly one week after President Ali Abdullah Saleh returned to Yemen at the end of a long period of medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. Intelligence analysts say that may have been no coincidence, and that with al-Awlaki's killing, Saleh is underlining to the West -- and the Saudis -- that they still need him. Saleh's return was something of a surprise both to Yemenis and the international community. He had been seen as the main stumbling block to political dialogue and a transition to fresh elections sponsored by the Gulf Cooperation Council. But several analysts consulted by CNN said the Saudis were concerned that the growing unrest in Yemen could morph into outright civil war -- in a country that shares a long and porous desert border with the kingdom. The rationale in Riyadh, according to these analysts, was that only Saleh had the guile and stature to pull his country back from the brink, despite his injuries and his array of enemies. And at the same time, Saleh would be best placed to turn up the heat on al Qaeda, now established in at least two eastern provinces and in parts of southern Yemen. Diplomatic sources in the Gulf say that far from being surprised by Saleh's return, the Saudi authorities sanctioned and assisted in it, providing a jet that flew him to the southern city of Aden in the early hours of Friday last week. They say Saleh did not fly directly to Sanaa, the capital, because the airport and the route into the city are not reliably under government control. In fact, the capital is now a patchwork of pro- and anti-Saleh enclaves. A helicopter was waiting at the Aden airport to fly Saleh 200 miles to the presidential palace in Sanaa before dawn. Again, arriving by air was probably preferable to negotiating the chaotic streets of the capital. American-born radical cleric understood the West . There has been no official comment from Saudi Arabia on how Saleh returned home from Riyadh, but sources in Sanaa and elsewhere in the Gulf say the Saudis wanted Saleh back in Yemen because they were increasingly anxious about the growing political influence of militant Islamists in Yemen seen as sympathetic to al Qaeda. They point out that Saleh met with Saudi King Abdullah a few days before he returned. The kingdom has long been concerned by the growth of al Qaeda in Yemen, even though the number of militants may not exceed several hundred. Several prominent Saudi jihadists have joined the leadership of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which for a while in recent months took control of most of the city of Zinjibar in southern Yemen. It was also from Yemen in August 2009 that al Qaeda sent a suicide bomber -- 23-year-old Abdullah Hassan Tali al-Asiri -- to carry out an assassination attempt on Saudi ArabiaÂ´s intelligence chief, Prince Muhammad Bin Naif, in August 2009. Analysts say that to the Saudis, and indeed to Washington, any commitment by Saleh to chase down al Qaeda's leadership in Yemen would be welcome indeed. And, they say, Saleh probably perceives a grand bargain himself: cooperate in tracking down al-Awlaki and other AQAP seniors in return for less pressure to leave office. U.S. drone killed American cleric in Yemen, officials say . Just hours before al-Awlaki's death, Saleh hinted at his own unique role in ""saving"" Yemen from al Qaeda, and broader coordination with allies, in an interview with the Washington Post and Time magazine. ""We are fighting the al Qaeda organization in [the southern region of] Abyan in coordination with the Americans and Saudis,"" he said in an interview at the presidential palace. ""At the same time, American intelligence has knowledge that (al Qaeda) is in contact with both the Muslim Brotherhood (the opposition Islah party) and the military officers who are outlaws. And they (the Muslim Brotherhood and officers) told the vice president, ""Give us Abyan, and we will stop the war in Abyan and the al Qaeda network there."" In other words: 'All my opponents are in league with al Qaeda.' Al-Awlaki: Who was he? Opposition figures in Yemen say it's unlikely that Saleh returned home, despite terrible burns and a chaotic situation, just to hand over the keys to the presidential palace. And certainly, since his return, Saleh has given little indication that he plans to go quietly. In the Time and Post interview, he launched a broadside against tribal leaders and dissident generals opposed to him. ""The GCC initiative is clear. It says to remove all the elements causing tensions,"" he said. ""Because if we transfer power and they are there, this will mean that we have given in to a coup. If we transfer power, and they are in their positions, and they are still decision-makers, this will be very dangerous. This will lead to civil war."" Former CIA spy: Al-Awlaki ""very narcissistic"" Christopher Boucek, an expert on Yemen with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says Saleh is the one political institution who is above everyone else in Yemen. He can adjudicate a dispute or solve a problem. ""In my mind it is no coincidence this happened after his return,"" Boucek says. Boucek adds that the dynamic inside Yemen has changed. Previously the government was reluctant to move against al-Awlaki because of fears about a hostile domestic reaction -- and the influence of his family and clan. That has changed: intelligence co-operation has improved and the killing of al-Awlaki is a way for Saleh to demonstrate that the United States still needs him. Saleh, now in power for more than forty years and regarded as one of the wiliest politicians in the Arab world, is well aware of the dynamic. ""What we see is that we are pressurized by America and the international community to speed up the process of handing over power,"" he told Time and the Washington Post. ""And we know to where the power is going to go. It is going to al-Qaeda, which is directly and completely linked to the Muslim Brotherhood."" The shorthand: ""Apres moi, la deluge."" But there is also a Yemeni saying which translates roughly as ""From a pound of talk, an ounce of understanding."" Suitable guidance in any exploration of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's motives and intentions.
