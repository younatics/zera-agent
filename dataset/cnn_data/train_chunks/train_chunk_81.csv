"(CNN) -- Chelsea target Fernando Torres has submitted a transfer request at Liverpool, but the English Premier League club still insist he is staying with them. With the hours ticking down until the end of the January transfer window, Liverpool signaled their intent to hold on to their star striker, who signed a new five-year contract with them in 2009. ""Fernando Torres tonight submitted a written transfer request, which has been rejected by Liverpool,"" said a club statement Friday night. ""Fernando is under long-term contract and the club expect him to honor the commitment he made to Liverpool FC and its supporters when he signed the agreement."" Earlier, the Merseyside club confirmed on its website that a bid had been received -- reported in British newspaper the Daily Telegraph to be around $63 million -- but it is expected reigning Premier League champions Chelsea will increase their offer ahead of Monday's deadline day. The 26-year-old striker, who was part of Spain's World Cup winning squad in South Africa, has scored nine goals this season and under new manager Kenny Dalglish looks to be returning to his best form. Liverpool, up to a season's best seventh after a midweek win over Fulham, have strengthened their squad with the signing of Uruguay striker Luis Suarez from Ajax to play up front with Torres. But Chelsea, trailing leaders Manchester United in this season's title race, are also keen to augment their aging squad, particularly in attack. Spanish club Atletico Madrid said they had turned down Chelsea's $82 million bid for Argentina striker Sergio Aguero earlier this week.","Liverpool reject transfer request from striker Fernando Torres .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- An insurgent attack on a Thai military camp in the country's south killed four soldiers and wounded six others, a military spokesman said Thursday. ""There were about 20 to 30 insurgents (who) attacked our permanent infantry camp in Maruebotok Village, Narathiwart province ... around 7:30 a.m. local time,"" said Col. Parinya Chaidilok, spokesman of the 4th Division of Internal Security Operation Command. Parinya said the military had received a tip-off information that there would an attack on Thai military posts. ""But we are surprised that they launched their attack at our permanent camp instead of small temporary posts,"" he said. Muslim separatists in southern Thailand have long battled government forces in a country that is overwhelmingly Buddhist. The conflict came to a head after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra took office in 2004. Several thousand people died in the violence.","Muslim separatists in southern Thailand have long battled government forces .

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A speaker claiming to be terrorism mastermind Osama bin Laden warned in an audiotape aired Friday that the release of two French journalists abducted by militants hinges on France's military role in Afghanistan. ""We repeat the same message to you,"" said the speaker in an audiotape played on the Al-Jazeera satellite news network. ""The release of your prisoners from the hands of our brethren depends on the withdrawal of your soldiers from our countries."" One U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN that the tape ""sends a chill up your spine,"" as it refers to ""a couple of human beings whose lives are at stake."" However, the official said it is unclear how much influence bin Laden might have over the fate of the hostages. Another counterterrorism official said he would not discuss whether it was in fact bin Laden on the latest tape other than to say, ""there has never been a recording that has been false"" about its claim to be him. On the tape, the speaker, believed to be al Qaeda chief bin Laden, warns the French government that its alliance with the United States will prove costly. ""The dismissal of your President (Nicholas) Sarkozy to get out of Afghanistan is the result of his subservience to the United States and this (dismissal) is considered to be the green signal to kill your prisoners without delay,"" the speaker said. He goes on to say that ""we will not do that at the time that suits him (Sarkozy) and this position will cost you dearly on all fronts, in France and abroad."" France, however, said the message would not deter it from its Afghanistan strategy. ""We are determined to stay in Afghanistan with our allies for the Afghan people,"" said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero. The first U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN that bin Laden's continuing messages serve as a ""reminder"" and an ""in your face"" signal that he is still out there. But, that official said, ""the relevance (of the tapes) are on the wane. ... His message doesn't resonate as well."" The second U.S. official said the tape is an effort by bin Laden to prove ""he is present, that he is engaging."" It's a ""morale factor to remind the people who follow him that he's still out there,"" the second official said. But this official said bin Laden's message is more ""inspirational"" than operational. Some could take his message as ""a directive,"" but there is no indication he is ""leading"" an operation, the official said. The official said there has been no change in the U.S. belief that bin Laden is hiding in Pakistan somewhere along the border with Afghanistan. Taliban militants captured the journalists --  Herve Ghesquiere and Stephane Taponier from France 3 Television -- in December 2009 and threatened to kill them if their demands were not met, including the release of some detainees held by France. France has 3,750 troops in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Al Qaeda's North African wing has made the same withdrawal demands pertaining to the safety of five French nationals abducted in Niger. CNN's Saad Abedine and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. counterterrorism official: The message's effect on the hostages' fate is unclear .

"(CNN) -- World MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi cruised to the 100th victory of his illustrious motorcycling career with a comfortable win at the Alice TT Assen race in the Netherlands on Saturday. Valentino Rossi dominated the Dutch race to move clear at the top of the championship standings. The Italian took sole ownership of top spot in the overall standings after finishing 5.638 seconds ahead of Fiat Yamaha team-mate Jorge Lorenzo and 23.113 in front of 2007 world champion Casey Stoner. The trio had been tied on 106 points ahead of the seventh of 18 races this season. Rossi started in pole position but briefly lost his lead to Stoner's Ducati before moving out in front again, and the Italian steadily increased his advantage throughout the 26-lap race. ""I am so happy. I felt good on the first lap and knowing that Lorenzo is difficult to beat I put my foot down to establish as big an advantage as possible over him,"" Rossi told reporters. ""It gives me great pleasure to record this victory. This is a great moment for me."" Rossi, now five points ahead of Lorenzo and nine clear of Stoner, is still 22 victories behind the all-time record held by 15-time world motorcycling champion Giacomo Agostini, who raced from 1964-77. Stoner, who started from fourth on the grid, revealed after the race that he had been struggling with ill health. ""I felt fine until Friday, but today I felt tired after the first couple of laps,"" the frail-Australian said. ""I have been taking any amount of supplements to keep my body up to scratch, but it has been a tough battle."" Lorenzo recovered from a poor start, which saw him drop to sixth after the first lap, to become Rossi's closest challenger with seven laps remaining. ""I want to congratulate Valentino. It is quite some achievement to win 100 Grand Prix,"" he said. Dani Pedrosa had begun the race from second ahead of fellow Spaniard Lorenzo, but crashed out at a corner after only four laps to dent his hopes of overtaking fellow Honda rider Andrea Dovizioso to claim fourth in the overall standings. Dovizioso also spun off in a similar situation on the same lap, and remains two points ahead of Pedrosa. Top-10 finishers: 1. V Rossi (Ita) Yamaha 42 minutes 14.611 seconds  2.

"(CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Qari Hussain Mehsud, whose notoriety includes allegedly recruiting children as suicide bombers, is being targeted by the United States, the State Department announced Thursday. ""Widely considered to be the deadliest of all TTP's commanders, Hussain and the TTP (Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan) have taken responsibility for many lethal suicide bombings throughout Pakistan,"" the State Department said in a news release on Qari Hussain. The released cited a string of such attacks, including a blast last September that killed at least 54 people at a rally in Quetta and a car bombing the same month that killed at least 17 people -- including four children -- in Lakki Marwat. Even among militant groups known for brutal violence, Qari Hussain Mehsud has a notorious reputation. He is alleged to have recruited dozens of Pakistani children as suicide bombers (a form of attack in which he reportedly is an expert trainer) and has boasted of personally beheading enemies. After the abortive Times Square bombing in New York last year, his voice was purportedly on the audio tape that claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the TTP. On several occasions, Pakistani officials have claimed that he has been killed. No evidence has ever been presented, and it seems that Qari Hussain is still somewhere in the rugged mountains along the Afghan-Pakistan border -- most likely in North Waziristan. He is well connected in jihadist circles. He is a cousin of the current leader of the TTP, Hakimullah Mehsud (himself a target of US drone attacks), and terrorism analysts believe he has good contacts with other groups active in the region. Not that those contacts have always been cordial -- Pakistani media reported in 2008 a feud over the fate of a Polish geologist who was being held by Qari Hussain's group. Rather than hand him over to another faction, they slit his throat. Qari Hussein comes from the Mehsud tribe, which is prominent in Waziristan and includes several other leading figures in the Pakistan Taliban. But he also spent time as a boy in Karachi, attending a hard-line Sunni ""madrassa"" or religious school. A Pakistani journalist, Tahir Ali, wrote last year of a meeting with Qari Hussain, who claimed to have been active in militant groups since boyhood. Ali quoted him as saying: ""I was very young when I joined Lashkar i Jhangvi and actively took part in anti-Shia activities; I also remained for a short time with Ilyas Kashmiri group ... later on I focused on jihad in Waziristan."" Both Lashkar and the Ilyas Kashmiri group are militant anti-Shia groups involved in terrorism in Pakistan and Indian Kashmir. Ilyas Kashmiri has repeatedly threatened to export terror attacks to Europe. According to Ali, he also claimed to be just 22 years of age. Others who have met him say that Qari Hussein appears to be in his early 40s. In January 2008, the Pakistani army launched ""Operation Zalzala"" against a Mehsud stronghold in South Waziristan. While many Taliban fighters were killed and his house was destroyed, Qari Hussain escaped. But Pakistani forces uncovered a ""school"" that he is said to have run for child suicide bombers, along with videos of classes. Pakistani Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan described the school as ""like a factory"" which had been turning 9- to 12-year old boys into suicide bombers. The U.S. State Department's designation of Qari Hussain Hussain says he ""has gained particular notoriety for his heavy recruitment of children."" Undaunted, Qari Hussain shifted his operations to North Waziristan and later released a 40-minute video in which teenagers and young men declared their intent to become suicide bombers. By this time, he was the commander of Fidayeen-e-Islam, a group within the Pakistani Taliban that specialized in suicide bombings. These were aimed at the Pakistani state and military, and included attacks on federal and police offices in Lahore. But they were also aimed at Pakistan's Shia minority. A Shia procession in Lahore in September 2010 was attacked by a Taliban suicide bomber, who killed 33 people. The number of suicide attacks rose dramatically between 2007 and 2010, and most were blamed on or claimed by the Pakistani Taliban. It was in May 2010 that the Pakistan Taliban was linked to its first attempted attack in the U.S. Faisal Shahzad attempted to leave a car bomb in New York's Times Square. It failed to go off, but an audio tape released hours later purported to feature the voice of Qari Hussein in claiming that ""the recent attack"" was in response to American ""interference and terrorism in Muslim countries, especially in Pakistan."" It's not known whether Qari Hussain met or trained Shahzad, but it seems likely that he was involved in the suicide bombing of the CIA base in Khost, Afghanistan, at the end of 2009. Before the attack, the suicide bomber recorded a video with Hakimullah Mehsud, and as the Pakistani Taliban's expert trainer of suicide bombers, Qari Hussain likely helped him prepare for the mission. In its designation, the U.S. State Department says ""Hussain is believed to have trained the Jordanian militant Humam Muhammad Abu Mulal al-Balawi"" who carried out the Khost attack, killing seven U.S. citizens. The Pakistani government has declared a reward of 50 million rupees ($600,000) for his capture, but Qari Hussain has evaded both capture and the much-expanded U.S. drone campaign. The U.S. action against Qari Hussain blocks all property ""subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Hussain has an interest"" and prohibits all transactions by U.S. persons with Hussain. Given his record so far, it is unlikely to have much impact on his role within the Pakistani Taliban.","Qari Hussain Mehsud's notoriety includes allegedly training children as suicide bombers .

"(CNN) -- A controversial Kansas church says members will picket before the memorial service Wednesday evening for two Florida teenagers allegedly killed by their mother. In a press release, Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, said it will demonstrate outside the service in Tampa because the mother is a military wife and ""the doomed American military declared war on God & His church."" The controversial church and its pastor, Fred Phelps, have made their name picketing near funerals of people who died of AIDS, gay people and soldiers. The church plans to picket beginning at 5:15 p.m.and ending at 6 p.m., when the service is scheduled to start, according to CNN affiliate WFTS-TV in Tampa. Julie K. Schenecker, 50, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths Friday of her 16-year-old daughter, Calyx, and her 13-year-old son, Beau. She was denied bail at a court appearance Monday, a court spokesman said. Her husband, Army Col. Parker Schenecker, is with the U.S. Central Command, which is headquartered in Tampa. Police told WFTS that he was in the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar when his children were killed. King High School, which Calyx attended, and Liberty Middle School, where Beau was a student, are sponsoring the service at First Baptist Church of Temple Terrace in Tampa, the church said. Josh Saliba, director of creative ministries, told CNN he would not comment on Westboro Baptist's plans to protest. On Monday -- their first day back since the shootings became public -- students at Liberty Middle School wore blue and black in memory of Beau, who was an eighth-grader there. CNN affiliate Bay News 9 posted a statement Monday from the Schenecker family: . ""Colonel Parker Schenecker has returned from his deployment and is grieving with family and friends. He is devoted first and foremost to honoring the lives and memory of his beautiful children, Calyx and Beau,"" the statement said. ""Parker and his family have been touched by the overwhelming support from the community both near and abroad. Arrangements and details are still being finalized with regard to the services to be held for Calyx and Beau."" A search warrant filed Tuesday said Julie Schenecker was unconscious and wearing a bloody robe, and her slain children were covered in blankets when police arrived. Julie Schenecker was awakened and taken from a screened-in pool area to inside the home, where evidence was recovered, according to the warrant filed in Circuit Court in Hillsborough County. The search warrant was posted on the website of CNN affiliate WTSP. The warrant provides new details in the case: Five bullets, along with a Smith & Wesson box and instruction manual, were found in the master bedroom; 15 live rounds and five spent shell casings were in the master bath. Also indicated in the search warrant -- both inside and outside the house -- were cigarette butts, note pads, undisclosed medication and paperwork. Police found Calyx's body in an upstairs bedroom. She had been shot twice in the head, police said. Beau's body was later found in the front seat of an SUV inside the home's garage, police said. They said he was shot while he was being driven to soccer practice. Schenecker confessed to killing the children, according to a police statement, eventually recounting her rationale and thought process ""in detail,"" according to a news release. ""She did tell us that they talked back, that they were mouthy,"" Tampa police spokeswoman Laura McElroy told CNN affiliate WTSP last week. ""But I don't think that will ever serve as an explanation to the rest of us of how you could take a child's life."" Schenecker had initially planned what she called the ""massacre"" -- killing the children and then herself, McElroy said on Monday -- for January 22, but she put it off after learning there would be a three-day check before she could buy a gun. Police later found writings in the house, thought to be from Schenecker, in which she spelled out her intentions in detail. ""There are definitely indications that she planned this,"" McElroy said. ""(The writing) was devoid of emotion."" CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report .","Westboro Baptist Church says it will picket service because mother is a military wife .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Final preparations are being made for the funeral Monday of slain Irish newlywed Michaela Harte-McAreavey. The 27-year-old was found strangled in her hotel room on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius last Monday. She was killed less than two weeks after her wedding. Her funeral will take place Monday afternoon at the church where she married Gaelic footballer John McAreavey on December 30. The president of the Republic of Ireland, Mary McAleese, will head dignitaries among thousands expected to attend a requiem mass at St. Malachy's Church, Ballymacilroy, Northern Ireland. The Catholic primate of all Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady, will be among senior clerics at a service led by McAreavey's uncle Bishop John McAreavey, who married the couple two and a half weeks ago. Hundreds of people attended Harte-McAreavey's wake at the Harte family home in County Tyrone over the weekend. Three suspects in her death are all employees of the luxury hotel where the newlywed was found strangled, according to the Mauritius Police Force. Room attendant Avinash Treebhoowoon, 29, and Sandip Moneea, 41, a floor supervisor, have been charged with murder. Room attendant Raj Theekoy, 33, faces a conspiracy charge. Police said one of the men has confessed and participated in the reconstruction. Authorities believe the men were inside the teacher's hotel room when she returned alone. ""We presume they were inside and burgling the room when the lady returned and were surprised and attacked her,"" Mauritius police Superintendent Yoosoof Soopun, who is leading the investigation, said last week. Authorities said the killer used an electronic key card to enter the room. The former beauty queen's husband was in the restaurant of the hotel when his wife was killed, and is not a suspect, Soopun said. An autopsy showed that she died of asphyxiation. Harte-McAreavey taught Irish at St. Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland. She won the Ulster Rose of Tralee contest and participated in other beauty pageants. She was the daughter of Tyrone Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte.","Michaela Harte-McAreavey was strangled while on her honeymoon in Mauritius .

"Sanaa,Yemen (CNN) -- What seemed like hundreds of anti-government protesters gathered near Sanaa University in Yemen's capital early Thursday morning, a clear indication that many in the country were not satisfied with President Ali Abdullah Saleh's recent announcement that he would not seek re-election. Demonstrators had said they would continue Thursday with a planned ""Day of Rage"" march in Yemen despite Saleh's concession Saleh on Wednesday. Trying to quell a growing discontent in the country, Saleh said he will not seek re-election once his current term ends in 2013, after more than three decades in office. He won't install his son to replace him also, he said. He also has asked his political opponents ""to re-engage in dialogue in hopes of reaching a sustainable and reconcilable political agreement,"" the Yemeni government said.

"(CNN) -- Liverpool's star striker Fernando Torres has given the club a huge boost ahead of the new Premier League season by insisting he has no intention of leaving the club. The Spanish forward's future has been up in the air since Liverpool slumped to a seventh placed finish last season, meaning they missed out on qualification for the European Champions League. Torres was part of the Spain squad that won the World Cup in South Africa and has only recently returned to training with Liverpool. Rumors of a £50 million bid from Chelsea surfaced during the tournament. Huang eyes Liverpool bid . But after captain Steven Gerrard committed himself to the club, and new manager Roy Hodgson strengthened the side with the purchase of England international Joe Cole, Torres has now said he is staying at Anfield. He told the club's official website: ""My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is the same as it was on my first day when I signed. I am looking forward to the challenge ahead. ""This is the best club in the country so the targets and expectations are always high. Hopefully we can stay at our level. At Liverpool the aim is to fight for every title. ""It was difficult last season but we are sure we can improve this season. I am really happy to be back, really happy to stay with all my teammates. I'm excited about the new season and about the targets of the club."" Torres came on for the final stages of the World Cup final, when Spain beat Netherlands 1-0, but picked up a groin injury seconds before the final whistle. The 26-year-old says he is fighting to be fit for the start of the season, and Liverpool's opening game with Arsenal on August 15. Torres also says he has been impressed with Hodgson -- the man who replaced Liverpool's former manager Rafael Benitez -- and appreciated the fact the 62-year-old traveled out to meet him when he was on holiday. ""I have less than two weeks to get ready but I felt really good in my first session back with the physios and the doctor,"" he said. ""At the moment I am training just on my own but as soon as I can I will train with the team and with the new manager."" ""I really appreciated the fact that Roy came out to see me while I was on my holidays. He told me about his plans for the club and what he wanted from me and I appreciated that. ""I hope he will be the right man to reach the targets of Liverpool Football Club and I am really looking forward to working with him."" Torres also welcomed the signing of Cole, who joined on a free transfer after leaving Premier League champions Chelsea in June. ""I think Joe is exactly the kind of player we need to improve the history of our club,"" he added. ""He is the kind of player I like to play with and the kind of player who can take the team to a higher level. ""His passing is unbelievable so hopefully he can start the season well because I am sure he will be a key player for us. I'm excited about playing with him and hopefully we can all help him settle into the team and the city to make sure he can reach his best as quickly as possible."" Torres also paid tribute to Liverpool's fans and repeated his desire to help end the club's run of 20 years without winning the league title. He said: ""I felt at home from the first day, I feel the fans love me and everyone knows I am really happy here and really happy to play at Anfield. ""I know that one trophy here at Liverpool -- maybe the Premier League -- means more than three or four with another club. This was my target from the day I came and it's still my target.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Suspected Islamic extremists arrested last week in Barcelona were planning al Qaeda-style attacks in Spain, Germany, France, Britain and Portugal, according to an informant who ""infiltrated"" the group, Spain's El Pais newspaper reports. ""If we attack the metro [subway system in Barcelona], the emergency services can't get there,"" one of the suspected suicide bombers told the informant, El Pais reported on Saturday. ""Our preference is public transport, especially the metro."" El Pais reported that it had access to the informant's testimony to Spanish officials. CNN has confirmed that authorities have given high importance to an informant's testimony. The judge who ordered 10 suspects held for allegedly plotting a suicide attack in Barcelona, cited in his rulings the testimony of an informant. CNN has viewed the rulings. Spain's Interior Minister last Friday said an informant warned of a planned suicide attack against Barcelona's metro on the weekend of January 18 to 20. But he added that, for now, ""there is only the testimony of an informant"" regarding the timing. The informant told authorities the cell comprised six suicide bombers, including himself, El Pais reported on Saturday. Spain's attorney general, Candido Conde-Pumpido, said last week that the cell could have contained six suicide bombers, two explosives experts and two ideologues. Judge Ismael Moreno, in rulings last Wednesday, wrote that the informant had named three suspected suicide bombers and an explosives expert, all of whom had traveled from Pakistan to Barcelona since last summer. The judge ordered these four men held, out the total of 10 jailed suspects who are from South Asia. They include nine Pakistani nationals and a man from India, who is Muslim. A court-appointed translator told CNN that all 10 suspects testified during their arraignments that they were innocent. The cell planned three attacks in Spain, one in Germany and others in France, Britain and Portugal, according to the informant, El Pais reported. On Sunday, another El Pais story added that the ""wave of attacks"" was to have been carried out by the Barcelona group and other extremist Pakistani cells were to attack elsewhere in Europe. The informant told authorities about potential links between the Barcelona group and suspected extremists in other countries, the interior minister said Friday. The informant had traveled by train from France to Barcelona on January 16, a few days before police made arrests in Barcelona, El Pais reported Saturday. A day earlier, the newspaper reported that the informant worked for French intelligence. Al Qaeda was planning to take responsibility for the first attack in Barcelona through Baitullah Mehsud, a Taliban commander whom the Pakistani government blames for last month's assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, El Pais reported. ""Only the leadership of the organization knows what requests the emir (Baitullah) will make after the first attack, but if they are not carried out, there will be a second attack in Spain, and a third,"" a cell leader told the informant, El Pais reported. ""And then in Germany, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom. There are many people prepared there."" In Barcelona, two pairs of suicide bombers were to attack in separate metro stations, the paper said, citing the informant's testimony. One of the cell leaders said the bombs were supposed to be hidden in backpacks or bags and that other cell members were to detonate them by remote control, the paper added. Two other pairs of suicide bombers were to strike elsewhere in Spain, while another suicide bomber was to attack in Germany, although the informant said he did not know where or when those attacks were to occur, El Pais reported. Three other terrorists were assigned to attack in France and two in Portugal, El Pais reported, although it did not mention locations or times for those attacks either. Civil Guards initially detained 14 people in Barcelona, but released two before arraignments last Wednesday. The judge then released two more, leaving 10 in jail for further investigation. It was not immediately known if the alleged informant may have been among those arrested and released. ""This cell was preparing to attack,"" Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Friday in an interview with Spanish radio network SER. ""It's clear they were going to try, whether last weekend (January 18 to 20) or within 15 days."" But he said police have not found explosives ""in sufficient quantity"" to have carried out the assault. ""We have found a modest quantity of explosives,"" Rubalcaba said, adding that they may have been intended for use in training the suspects. The judge in his rulings wrote that the group ""had achieved human operational capacity and were very close to achieving full technical capacity with explosives, with the aim of using those explosives for a jihadi terrorist attack."" Rubalcaba said that, for any such suspected terrorist cell, ""the time from getting explosives to carrying out the attack can be very short."" The judge wrote that police had found nitrocellulose and mechanical and electrical elements that could have been used to make one or more bombs. More than 300 suspected Islamic extremists have been arrested in Spain since the Madrid train bombings killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 on March 11, 2004, Rubalcaba said. Last October, more than a dozen Islamic extremists were convicted in Madrid for their roles in the train bombings. The 2004 bombings came just three days before general elections, in which Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero won an upset victory. The latest arrests in Barcelona come less than two months before the next general elections, to be held March 9, when Zapatero seeks re-election. Spain remains on ""permanent alert"" against Islamic terrorism. Al Qaeda communiques regularly make specific references to Spain.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Iraq's prime minister wants the American military to hand over ""Chemical Ali"" and two other convicted officials from Saddam Hussein's regime for execution, an Iraqi official said Tuesday, but the move could widen the divide between Iraq's Sunni and Shiite Muslim communities. Ali Hassan al-Majeed, aka ""Chemical Ali,"" was sentenced to death in June for his role in the 1988 Anfal campaign. Ali Hassan al-Majeed (aka ""Chemical Ali""), Sultan Hashem Ahmed and Hussein Rashid were sentenced to death in June for their roles in the 1988 Anfal campaign, an Iraqi army operation in Kurdish-dominated northern Iraq that killed tens of thousands of people. The three were to be executed in October, 30 days after their appeals were exhausted, but the three members of Iraq's presidency council have not signed the execution orders, as Iraqi law requires. Many Sunni Arabs and U.S. officials don't think Ahmed and Rashid should be executed because such a move could anger Sunnis. Only recently have U.S. efforts to bring Sunni Arabs into the Iraqi political fold paid off. After the toppling of Hussein's Sunni-dominated government and the emergence of the Shiite-dominated power structure, Sunni Arabs began supporting the insurgency. The United States since has made it a political priority to include Sunnis in the Iraqi power structure. At the same time, Iraq's Shiites might be angry if the three men aren't executed. Shiites were persecuted under Hussein, and they want to punish convicted members of the former regime. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki wrote a letter to President Bush last week asking him to order the military to hand over the three men, but it was unclear if Bush replied, the official in al-Maliki's office said. Though the Iraqi High Tribunal sentenced the men to death in June, the three remain in U.S. custody. The delay in their executions has been attributed to legal and procedural issues. U.S. officials said the men will be handed over when those issues are resolved. On Sunday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte told reporters in Baghdad that there are disagreements on what to do about the situation. ""Once the government of Iraq has reached a consensus on what they wish to do about these detainees, we will then take action, but at the moment the government of Iraq itself has not reached its own consensus as to what to do about this situation. So we await that,"" Negroponte said. Iraqi law requires the three members of Iraq's presidency council sign the execution warrants, but the law doesn't explain what happens if leaders don't sign the warrants. Jalal Talabani, the Kurdish president, and Tariq al-Hashimi, the Sunni vice president, are unwilling to sign an execution order. The third member of the council is the Shiite vice president, Adel Abdul Mahdi. A Western official close to the case said last month that Iraqi courts have not addressed whether the council's inaction constitutes a de facto pardon or a stay of execution, but al-Maliki has said the ruling was upheld by an appellate court and should be carried out regardless of the signatures. Al-Maliki's letter to Bush and public statements by the prime minister and others misrepresent ""the Iraqi law applicable in this particular case as well as with respect to the procedure governing executions more generally,"" the official said. Iraqi legal advisers have informed the government of their ""unambiguous opinions"" regarding the law and executing the three men without approval of the presidency council ""would violate Iraqi law and, arguably, international law binding upon individual Iraqi officials,"" the official said. The Western official further said Rashid was not ""criminally culpable for anything that happened during Anfal"" and that Ahmed and is ""extremely popular"" among military officials. Ahmed's constituency ""cuts across Sunni-Shia lines,"" the official said. ""At the end of the day, what I think that we shall see is a compromise: The life of Ali Hassan al-Majeed will be traded for the savings of the lives"" of Ahmed and Rashid, the Western official said. Other developments . • A man appearing in a video shown by an Arabic-language TV network Tuesday is believed to be one of five Britons kidnapped in Baghdad this year, said a Canadian-based security firm that employs the man. A spokesman for Garda World Security Corp. said company officials believe that the video is authentic.  The video, which included a demand for Britain to pull out of Iraq, shows two armed militants pointing machine guns toward the hostage but not to his head. It aired on the Dubai-based network Al-Arabiya. • A suicide bomber blew himself up Tuesday near a police station north of Baghdad, killing eight people and wounding 30, police in Baquba said. The bomb detonated outside a main gate of a police station in Jalula. Among the dead were four police officers and two Iraqi Kurdish troops. The troops had been deployed to the area as part of a security crackdown. • A U.S. soldier was killed ""as a result of injuries sustained from a vehicle explosion during a vehicle recovery operation"" in western Iraq, the U.S. military said Tuesday. Two troops were wounded in the Monday incident in Anbar province. The number of troops killed in the Iraq war stands at 3,876. Seven civilian contractors also have been killed. • A freeze in activity by the Mehdi Army -- the militia of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr -- that began more than three months ago has had ""very significant"" effects in Baghdad, a U.S. military commander said. Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner cited security improvements, including potent military operations, the development of ""concerned local citizen"" security volunteers and the development of grass-roots support for the Iraqi government. These have occurred amid a drop in attacks and a decline in civilian and military deaths since the U.S. troop escalation called the ""surge"" began this year. • Commercial airline travel from the largest city in northern Iraq has resumed for the first time in 14 years, a development called a ""significant step for the revitalization of the economy"" in the northern region, according to a U.S. military news release. A flight carrying 152 Muslim pilgrims for the annual hajj pilgrimage to the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca left the Mosul airport Sunday , the military said. The airport, built in 1992, hasn't had commercial airline traffic since a ""no-fly"" zone was declared in 1993 by American troops during the Hussein era. • The U.S. military said Tuesday it had killed a high-ranking al Qaeda in Iraq operative who had been an adviser to the group's leader, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, and to its former leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in a U.S.-led coalition raid last year. Abu Maysara, aka Abu Basha'ir, was killed northeast of Samarra on November 17 during a coalition operation. He was identified using DNA, the military said.  E-mail to a friend .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners attended the funeral Monday of the newlywed Irish teacher strangled in Mauritius a week ago. Requiem Mass was held Monday at the same Catholic church in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, where 27-year-old Michaela Harte-McAreavey was married less than three weeks ago. She was buried in her wedding dress in the graveyard next to the church, St Malachy's, Ballymacilroy. It was one of the biggest funerals in Northern Ireland for several years, with political and community representatives from all sides attending. Irish President Mary McAleese and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams were among the mourners. Harte-McAreavey's bereaved husband, Gaelic footballer John McAreavey, and her father, leading Gaelic football coach Mickey Harte, supported each other as they walked behind the coffin and helped carry it to the church. The mass was led by McAreavey's uncle, Bishop John McAreavey, who married the couple on December 30. ""An evil act ended Michaela's young life last Monday, it robbed John of his beautiful wife, it deprived the Harte family of their precious daughter and sister, it deprived the McAreavey family of the daughter-in-law they looked forward to having. It shattered hopes and dreams for the future,"" he said. He said the couple enjoyed a ""special love"" and ""lived for each other"" and that ""nothing in John's young life could have prepared him for the ordeal of this past week."" Thousands of people had attended Harte-McAreavey's wake at the Harte home over the weekend. In the Northern Ireland Assembly Monday, Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson said memories of the murdered honeymooner had united people in grief. ""Any life taken away by murder is a horrific event, all the more so when it is of a young person,"" he said. ""The loss is even more harrowing and devastating because the victim in this case was a beautiful young woman who was on her honeymoon. ""This is one of the rare tragedies that has captured public attention and united the community in grief."" Three suspects in her death are all employees of the luxury hotel where the newlywed was found strangled, according to the Mauritius Police Force. Room attendant Avinash Treebhoowoon, 29, and Sandip Moneea, 41, a floor supervisor, have been charged with murder. Room attendant Raj Theekoy, 33, faces a conspiracy charge. Police said one of the men has confessed and participated in the reconstruction. Authorities believe the men were inside the teacher's hotel room when she returned alone. ""We presume they were inside and burgling the room when the lady returned and were surprised and attacked her,"" Mauritius police Superintendent Yoosoof Soopun, who is leading the investigation, said last week. Authorities said the killer used an electronic key card to enter the room. The former beauty queen's husband was in the restaurant of the hotel when his wife was killed, and is not a suspect, Soopun said. An autopsy showed that she died of asphyxiation.","Michaela Harte-McAreavey was strangled on her honeymoon in Mauritius .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday it has ended the military career of a soldier involved in a commando raid this month in the West Bank city of Hebron during which five Hamas members were arrested and a 66-year-old Palestinian man was ""regrettably killed."" The investigation into the January 7 arrest operation, in which Amr Qawasme was killed, ""concluded that the initial firing at Qawasme was done following a suspicious movement that caused the soldier to feel that his life was threatened,"" the IDF said in a statement. It found no fault with the initial shooting, saying it had been executed ""in accordance with IDF rules of engagement."" But the actions of a second soldier, who watched the first soldier fire at Qawasme and fired, too, were unprofessional, and that soldier's military service has been terminated, the IDF statement said. ""The IDF deeply regrets the death of Amr Qawasme,"" it said. The shooting prompted cries of outrage from Palestinians, and about 4,000 mourners attended Qawasme's funeral. The IDF statement did not identify the man whose military career was terminated. Asked why not, a woman who answered the phone for the IDF said his name was withheld for privacy reasons. Pressed, she added, ""It's not relevant to the announcement."" She would not identify herself.","Israel Defense Forces concludes that commando's actions were unprofessional .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Legendary pinup queen Bettie Page died of pneumonia at the age of 85 in a Los Angeles, California, hospital Thursday, a week after suffering a heart attack, according to her agent. Pinup queen Bettie Page was credited with helping to usher in the sexual revolution. ""She captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality,"" said agent Mark Roesler in a written statement. ""She is the embodiment of beauty."" Page, said to be one of the most photographed people of the past century, became a recluse in recent decades. Yet, her images continued to be used around the world to market Bettie Page action figures, clothing lines and other merchandise. ""Her popularity as an underground, guilty pleasures phenomenon has continued to soar despite the fact that the reclusive Page disappeared almost a half century ago, leading many to believe that one of the most photographed individuals of the 20th century was already dead."" Roesler said. The Web site, BettiePage.com, logs about 20 million hits a month, Roesler said. A TVGuide.com poll recently placed Bettie Page as the ""ultimate sex goddess,"" outscoring others such as Marilyn Monroe. iReport.com: Share your trubutes to Bettie Page . Page was born to a poor family in Tennessee on April 22, 1923. While her birth certificate spelled her name ""Betty,"" she changed the spelling later in life to ""Bettie."" At a time when few women pursued a college education, Page earned a bachelor of arts degree in education from Peabody College in Tennessee in 1944, according to her official biography. Her teaching career, however, was hampered by her looks, she said. ""I couldn't control my students, especially the boys,"" she is quoted as saying. After her modeling career ended, Page returned to Peabody College to work on a master's degree, the bio said. Her Southern drawl and a refusal to sleep with a Hollywood producer hampered her acting career, according to her bio. ""I didn't like his looks,"" Page said. ""I wouldn't have gone to bed with him anyway. He was a creep. He drove off in his big car and scolded me, 'You'll be sorry.' I wasn't."" Page said she regretted not accepting studio boss Jack Warner's offer of another screen-test, but it came while she was trying to save her marriage to her first husband, Billy Neal. Her modeling breakthrough began after she divorced Neal in 1947 when she met a police officer whose hobby was photography. He suggested the black bangs, which became her trademark, her bio said. Not long after, her images were everywhere, gracing magazine covers and locker pin-ups. Page wore nothing but a Santa hat in Playboy's January 1955 centerfold. Playboy founder Hugh Hefner said her appearance in his magazine's first year was a milestone. ""She became, in time, an American icon, her winning smile and effervescent personality apparent in every pose,"" Hefner said. ""A kinky connection was added by Irving Klaw's spanking, fetish and bondage photos, which became part of the Bettie Page mystique,"" Hefner said. ""They were playful parodies that are now perceived as the early inspiration for Madonna's excursions into the realm of sexual perversion."" Perhaps the most memorable photos of Page were her bondage poses, which she said were all pretend. ""I never understood how anyone believed those poses were sexy,"" she later said. ""To be tied up? I don't get it."" ""She was a remarkable woman, truly someone that changed the social norms, not only here in this country, but also around the world,"" Roesler said. ""While Jackie Robinson was changing the racial attitudes, Bettie Page was changing our attitudes on sex. She became a James Dean type of 'rebel' figure as she allowed people to be less inhibited and look at sex in a different way."" Saucy photos of Paige in skimpy clothing or none at all helped to lead the way for the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Page suddenly disappeared from the scene in 1958. It was only decades later revealed that she re-emerged to explain that she underwent a religious conversion and moved to Florida. Her life took a dark turn starting in 1978 after her third marriage failed, Roesler said. Page went through ""some mental instability, violent mood swings, and serious trouble with the law"" and was eventually diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, according to her bio. Page reappeared in public in December 2003 for Playboy's 50th anniversary party, where she made a grand entrance with Anna Nicole Smith. It was the only time in the past 50 years that Page allowed her photograph to be taken, Roesler said. A private funeral service is planned for Tuesday. Page will buried at Westwood Cemetery in Los Angeles, just a few feet away from Monroe.","Pinup beauty Bettie Page dies at hospital a week after suffering heart attack .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A pair of suicide attacks Wednesday morning in Iraq's Diyala province, north of Baghdad, killed at least 16 people and wounded nearly 100 others, authorities said. A suicide bomber drove a vehicle loaded with explosives into the headquarters compound of Force Protection Services in the heart of the provincial capital of Baquba during morning training, according to police officials in Baquba and Baghdad. Force Protection Services is the Iraqi security agency responsible for protecting the country's government institutions. At least 13 people were killed and 70 wounded in that attack. Two of those killed were security guards, who were stationed at the first and main checkpoint before the attacker forced his vehicle forward. South of Baquba, a suicide bomber wearing a vest packed with explosives detonated near a convoy carrying the deputy head of Diyala's provincial council, Sadiq al-Husseini, police said. The attack in al-Ghalbiya killed at least three people and wounded 26 others, including al-Husseini. Al-Husseini's convoy was traveling with a procession of Shiite pilgrims who were making a four-day trek by foot to Karbala for Arbaeen, a religious observation that falls after 40 days of mourning for Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammed who was felled in a 7th century battle in the Iraqi city. The three killed in the blast were pilgrims, as were several of the wounded. Thousands of Shiites are making their way to Karbala, and there is fear of more bloodshed ahead of next week's Arbaeen commemoration. The bloody attacks came a day after a suicide bomber wearing an explosives-packed vest detonated at a police recruitment center in Salaheddin province, also in northern Iraq. That strike killed at least 65 people and wounded 160 others. Five others -- all Shiite pilgrims -- were wounded Tuesday in a separate attack in Taji, just north of Baghdad. Diyala was an al Qaeda stronghold until 2008, when Iraqi security forces, backed by U.S. troops, conducted major military operations in the province to push the militants out. Awakening Councils also played a major role in hunting down al Qaeda fighters in the province. Awakening Councils, whose members are predominantly Sunni, have been recruited by the U.S. military to work against al Qaeda in Iraq and other militias.","NEW: Three of the dead were Shiite pilgrims headed to the holy city of Karbala .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- The body of Michaela Harte-McAreavey, a newlywed killed on her honeymoon in Mauritius, has been returned to her home in Northern Ireland. Friends and neighbors lined a route Friday night as the hearse carrying the body passed. The 27-year-old daughter of Tyrone Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte and wife of Down Gaelic footballer John McAreavey was found strangled in her hotel room on the Indian Ocean island Monday. She was killed less than two weeks after her wedding. Three suspects are all employees of a luxury hotel where the 27-year-old newlywed was found strangled, according to the Mauritius Police Force.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Twenty years after the United States and its allies launched Operation Desert Storm to roll back Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, Iraq still owes its smaller neighbor billions in reparations and more than 1,000 people are still missing. It was in August 1990 that Iraq invaded, declaring that Kuwait was its 19th province. The United States led a counteroffensive starting January 16, 1991. While the era of Saddam Hussein is now part of history, the impact of the invasion he ordered is anything but. ""Kuwait was of course traumatized by the invasion in 1990,"" said Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group, which monitors conflicts around the world. ""It has yet to overcome the fear that Iraq will yet again want to show that Kuwait is the 19th province rather than an independent neighboring state -- and Kuwait will want some kind of guarantees that will not be repeated."" The United Nations lifted Hussein-era sanctions against Iraq in December, a largely symbolic step toward Iraq regaining full sovereignty and its status in the international community. And although its government has continued to reassure the international community that the new Iraq is no longer a threat, Baghdad is still subject to U.N. resolutions over its outstanding disputes with Kuwait. More than 1,000 people -- or their remains -- are still missing, including Iraqis, Kuwaitis and others. The Kuwaiti government also wants back government documents that disappeared during the invasion in 1990. Iraq, Kuwait and the International Committee of the Red Cross are working together on the missing persons. Iraq is also continuing to pay off its war reparations to its neighbor. Baghdad says it has paid about $30 billion to date and still has to pay more than $20 billion more. The money is deducted from Iraq's main income, oil revenues. Government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh says Iraq needs money itself, and has paid enough. ""We are subject to the deduction of 5% of our revenue. That is, of course, influencing the revenue of the Iraqi people. It's influencing the budget,"" he said. ""I do understand that Saddam created damages to the others, but again, it's enough,"" he told CNN. ""We do need each and every penny"" for ""reconstruction of our destroyed country"" and because the Iraqi people need services, he said. And while the borders between the two countries have finally been established with the help of the United Nations, questions remain on both sides regarding rights and access, and some 200 Iraqi families must be relocated. In what is arguably the biggest step toward improving these strained ties, Kuwait's Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah visited Baghdad on Wednesday, the highest-ranking Kuwaiti visit in decades. Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is expected to make a visit to Kuwait soon. ""Now we see a thaw of sorts, we'll have to see how far it goes,"" said Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group. ""That could lead to a peace treaty of some sort because there are some outstanding issues that need to be resolved, but all of them are resolvable, and I think if the political will is there, it can be done."" Analysts say while there are signs of progress being made, the issue is essentially a lack of trust on both sides -- and building that trust will not be easy.","Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and the U.S. led a counteroffensive in January 1991 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Marine commander on Wednesday warned of a ""growing"" insurgent threat in Afghanistan, but he said forces would have to be cut in Iraq to send more Marines to Afghanistan. Marines could be pulled from Iraq's Anbar province, Gen. James Conway said Wednesday. ""To do more in Afghanistan, our Marines have got to see relief elsewhere,"" said Gen. James Conway in a briefing for Pentagon reporters. Conway said the Corps' two regimental combat teams -- about 10,000 Marines -- in Iraq's Anbar province could be removed as there are only two or three insurgent attacks a day in what was once the hotbed of the Iraqi insurgency. The U.S.-led coalition is scheduled to hand over security control in Anbar to Iraqi troops next week. Despite the progress, Conway said, he doesn't expect any decisions on troop withdrawals until Gen. David Petraeus -- the head of the U.S. military in Iraq -- makes his recommendations on troop deployment in Iraq to President Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates. There are more than 3,000 Marines in Afghanistan, and Conway said that the Marine Corps would be willing to help bolster the fight against the Taliban in that country. ""I think that a battalion of Marines in Afghanistan count for more than a battalion of Marines in Iraq, if you will, just in terms of the impact that they can have,"" he said.","Marines in Iraq's once-volatile Anbar province could leave, general says .

"(CNN) -- An Indonesian court on Wednesday handed a seven-year sentence to a former tax official for corruption in a case that  exposed rampant government graft. Gayus Tambunan was also fined 300 million rupiah ($30,000 ) after being found guilty of corruption. Crowds booed and jeered when the judge read the verdict, which was less than the 20 years demanded by the prosecutors. Prosecutors plan to appeal. Gayus  case came into the spotlight after he cooperated with the police to become a whistle-blower and expose the corruption in almost all aspect of the Indonesian judiciary system. ""This case have been influenced by many sides to make me look like public enemy number one in Indonesia,"" Gayus said after the verdict. ""I'm really disappointed with legal system mafia task force (formed to combat corruption in the judiciary system), who didn't investigate the high level officials and instead politicized the issue."" Gayus first came to national attention when he was arrested for bribing the judges, prosecutors and the police for more than $2 million to have his corruption case dismissed. He was initially accused of helping companies evade taxes. Police later revealed that the lowly tax official, despite making a only modest income a month, had reportedly amassed millions of dollars in cash and assets. Gayus stirred anger in the country when he was photographed in Bali watching a tennis tournament when he was supposed to be in custody for his corruption case. He said he was in need of a holiday after feeling ""stressed out"" in prison. He later admitted that he had escaped prison at least 68 times by bribing the guards. He said he has taken trips to various destinations, including Macau, with fake passports obtained from the immigration office. ""Gayus is just the tip of the iceberg, his case indicates rampant corruption in the judiciary system, the tax office and the immigration office but the main issue seems to be avoided,"" said  Adrianus Meliala, a criminology professor and police observer. ""For instance, the police investigation didn't include where the funds were funneled. This case doesn't surprise me because corruption has become a culture in the tax office and this shows that the reform process is far from finished."" The case prompted the president to order authorities to look into dozens of companies allegedly linked to Gayus and recover state assets.","Gayus Tambunan was also fined $30,000 .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran said the gunman who killed Neda Agha-Soltan may have mistaken her for the sister of an Iranian ""terrorist,"" the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday. In death, Neda Agha-Soltan has emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition to the Iranian government. Iran blamed the death of the woman known to the world simply as Neda squarely on ""those groups who want to create division in the nation,"" saying they planned the woman's killing ""to accuse the Islamic republic of ruthlessly dealing with the opposition,"" according to IRNA, Iran's state-run news agency. The report said the investigation into her death is ongoing, ""but according to the evidence so far, it could be said that she was killed by mistake. The marksmen had mistaken her for the sister of one of the Monafeghin who had been executed in the province of Mazandaran some time ago."" Monafeghin refers to the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran, or PMOI, which promotes a secular, Marxist government for Iran, and has waged a violent campaign against the fundamentalist Islamic regime, including bombings that killed politicians, judges and Cabinet members. Also known as Mujahedin-e-Khalq, the group initially was formed to oppose the Shah of Iran but fell out of favor with the Islamic Revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after 1979. The European Union removed the group from its list of terrorist organizations this year, prompting outrage from Tehran. The Iranian Foreign Ministry accused the European Union of ""making friends and cooperating with terrorists"" by removing the group from its list. Neda, 26, rose to prominence within hours after a crudely shot video documenting her final moments was uploaded to the Web. Shortly after she died Saturday from a single gunshot wound to the chest, she emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition to the Iranian government.  See images of Neda and the impact of her death » .

"(CNN) -- European Ryder Cup star Miguel Angel Jimenez snapped his putter in frustration at the Volvo Golf Champions tournament in Bahrain but then carded three birdies with his lob wedge to tie for the lead. The Spaniard became increasingly frustrated with his play on the greens after missing a succession of birdie chances and snapped his putter in two on the 13th hole. But if anything, it gave his game a boost as he picked up shots on the 15th, 16th and 17th to finish with a 65 and tie with three other players at 11-under-par after the second round. Italian Edoardo Molinari, Sweden's Peter Hanson and Frenchman Raphaël Jacquelin share the lead with Jimenez. After his extraordinary hat-trick of birdies Jimenez joked on the European Tour website: ""I think now I putt with my lob wedge."" Northern Irishman Darren Clarke, who was a vice-captain during Europe's Ryder Cup victory over the United States in Wales last year, was playing with Jimenez when his putter felt the full force of his anger. Clarke told how his playing partner ""just caught the edge of his bag"" with the putter, joking that his backswing was ""a bit long."" Molinari came flying out of the traps carding six birdies in the opening six holes but after such an impressive start he managed only one more in his round of 65. Hanson shot a five-under round of 67 to take a share of the lead, while Jacquelin matched Molinari and Jimenez with seven birdies in his round. Clarke is in a group of four players one shot behind the leaders with England's Paul Casey, Scot Stephen Gallacher and South Africa's James Kingston. It wasn't such a good day for England's Ian Poulter who finished on three-under and tied for 50th place. After his opening round of level par on Thursday he ranted on his Twitter site. He said: ""Played great today 35 putts, missed 1 green, Simply the WORST greens i have ever seen & im not joking they are embarrassing."" He later added: ""Apparently the Architect wanted to make a statement with the greens, he did that alright they are &%$#.""","Miguel Angel Jimenez takes share of Volvo Golf Champions after snapping putter .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- A day after the Tunisian president indicated that he wouldn't run again, protesters peacefully took to the streets in tense North African nation's capital to protest his rule. Thousands of people congregated in front of the Interior Ministry in Tunis, and chanted slogans such as ""Get out!"" and ""Freedom for Tunisia!"" Haykal Maki, a pro-opposition lawyer who was in the throng, said protesters want a ""regime change,"" the resignation of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and lawsuits addressing the regime's corruption. Tunisia has been wracked by angry demonstrations, with citizens protesting high unemployment, alleged corruption, rising prices, limitations on rights, and anger with the government's performance. The wave of protests was sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate, a man who torched himself in December after police confiscated his fruit cart. In an address on national TV on Thursday night, Ben Ali addressed the crisis in a speech that came as street unrest percolated and a message purportedly from an al Qaeda affiliate announced its support of protesters. He vowed to cut prices of basic foodstuffs, to lift censorship and to ensure police do not use live ammunition except in self-defense, and indicated that he will not run again for president. ""Enough violence,"" Ben Ali said on national television after days of riots that have killed at least 21 people. ""I also gave orders to the interior minister ... not to use live ammunition. It is unacceptable and unjustified unless someone uses his weapon and forces you to defend yourself."" Ben Ali said he had asked the prime minister to reduce prices of staples, including sugar, milk and bread and said he had decided to give ""complete freedom to all media outlets ... as long as they respect our values and the value of the profession."" The 74-year-old president added that he would not push to change the law setting an age limit for presidential candidates in the next election in 2014. By then, he would have exceeded the 75-year age limit. ""There will not be presidency for life,"" he said. Organized mainly by the country's lawyers' union mainly and other unions, the crowd on Friday was under the watchful eye of a contingent of riot police officers. But the protesters freely were not shy about slamming the government and Ben Ali's rule. Demonstrators shouted ""Public trial for the president's family!"" and ""Yes to water and bread, but NO to Ben Ali!"" Reem Ben Yousef, a 37-year-old university professor, told CNN that the protesters say the ruling family have robbed citizens and they want them to depart from public life. Reem says that Ben Ali's speech was staged and was cynical about the presence of a pro-government demonstration after his speech. ""We do not believe in Ben Ali and his regime,"" she said.","Thousands are congregated in Tunis .
The demonstration is peaceful .
This comes a day after the president's speech ."
"(CNN) -- Tennis superstar Roger Federer is hoping to help the victims of the Australian floods by setting up a fund-raising event this weekend. Rising waters in Queensland have left the state's premier warning of ""the worst natural disaster in our history"" as homes have been flooded and power cut off in the capital city Brisbane. Federer, who is in Melbourne preparing to begin the defense of his Australian Open title next week, set up a similar exhibition following the Haiti earthquakes a year ago. ""The floods here in Australia are devastating! I am on my way to practice now and am going to speak with Tennis Australia to see if we perhaps can organize something on Sunday to help raise some funds for the people of Queensland who have been affected,"" Federer said on his Facebook page on Wednesday. ""Stay tuned as it would be great if the sport of tennis can help out right before the Australian Open begins."" Tense waiting game for Brisbane residents . The 29-year-old Swiss player supports several charities, having launched his own foundation in 2003 to help disadvantaged children. He and tennis rival Rafael Nadal raised $2.6 million in the first of two offseason charity matches in Zurich in December. He also visited tsunami victims as part of his role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Tennis stars have already contributed to the Queensland disaster fund, with American Andy Roddick donating $10,800 after reaching the final of the tournament in Brisbane last weekend. Australian star Samantha Stosur also made a donation, and Roddick's website reported that the men's and women's ATP and WTA ruling bodies would pledge $10 for every ace serve hit by their players in Brisbane, Sydney this week and the Australian Open.","Queensland has been hit by rising flood waters in the past week or so .

"(CNN) -- Lie-detector tests could be used in a bid to stamp out corruption in cricket, an advisory committee of the sport's rule-making body announced on Wednesday. Cricket was shrouded in controversy earlier this year when three members of the Pakistan team became the subject of match-fixing allegations during a tour of England. Following a police investigation, captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif -- who all protested their innocence -- will face a disciplinary hearing by the International Cricket Council in January. But after a meeting of the MCC World Cricket Committee in Perth on Tuesday and Wednesday, officials admitted that the latest corruption scandal has had a negative impact on the sport. Blog: Will Australia's one-day cricket reign end in 2011? ""We are concerned at the scale of the problem, and the detrimental effect it has placed on the integrity of the game,"" a statement on the MCC's official website read. ""The committee feels more resources -- and increased powers -- are required to attempt to eradicate this issue from the game. The education of players should not be a meaningless formality; the message should be pressed home with regularity by figures known and respected by the players."" As well as the possible introduction of lie-detector tests, other suggestions included the legalizing and regulating of betting markets in India, the inclusion of anti-corruption clauses in playing contracts and the non-inclusion of ""tainted"" players. The committee, comprised of past and present cricketers and officials, also said that captains should take more responsibility for their players. Its recommendations will be considered by the MCC Laws sub-committee in February. However, the proposal to use lie-detectors to determine whether or not players are competing for the right reasons has already been questioned. ""I don't know about the accuracy of lie-detector tests,"" England captain Andrew Strauss told the UK Press Association on Wednesday on the eve of his side's third Ashes Test against Australia in Perth. ""But what I do know, and is probably more important, is that we don't want the whiff of anything suspicious going on in the game."" Strauss' team also came under the spotlight when Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt made accusations -- which he later withdrew -- that some England players had themselves accepted money to fix match results. The ongoing scandal took a further turn when Pakistani wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider fled to Britain during a series with South Africa in Abu Dhabi, claiming he had refused to fix a match. ""We've seen how disruptive and detrimental to the game of cricket it is. If we have to take extreme measures in order to be 100% confident the game is being played in the right spirit, then I'd certainly be happy to do that,"" Strauss said. ""I'd have to think about the arguments (for lie-detector tests) first. But the principle, of having 22 guys on the pitch that the supporters are absolutely 100% certain are playing the game for the right reasons, is a good thing.""","Cricket rule makers could introduce lie-detectors to help fight corruption in the sport .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have found a second homemade explosive and more of a type of explosive previously discovered in a house in an unincorporated area near Escondido, California, officials said Thursday. The house occupied by George Djura Jakubec, a computer software consultant who is now under arrest, has been described by authorities as a bomb-making factory. They say it holds the largest cache of the two homemade explosives ever discovered in one spot in the United States. San Diego County authorities confirmed Thursday they have found pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, a favorite of al Qaeda bomb-makers that is now the target of new U.S. airport body scans and pat downs. They also found more hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, or HMTD, in a bottle inside the house, but the two types of homemade explosives were not immediately removed because they are too volatile and the house is too cluttered to negotiate safely, Assistant Sheriff Ed Prendergast said. Authorities had already recovered 8 or 9 pounds of HMTD, an explosive powder that suicide bombers use, authorities said. The search of the house also turned up items ""suggestive of armed robberies,"" Prendergast said in a written statement. In addition to bomb-making charges, Jakubec, 54, is charged with two bank robberies. Now being held in lieu of $5 million bail, he was on probation for a 2009 burglary conviction when he was arrested last week. Authorities are investigating Jakubec's intentions. He is a Serbian national who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and he lived in the house with his wife. Authorities also found Wednesday more blasting caps, adding to others discovered in the past week, but they were not removed from the house, officials said. A San Diego County hazardous materials team removed chemicals from a shed on the property, authorities said. They included about 4 liters of hydrochloric acid, 1 liter of nitric acid, 25 gallons of sulfuric acid and 50 pounds of hexamine. A bomb squad from San Diego County agencies and the FBI has suspended a search inside the home until Wednesday, as authorities study how to proceed within the cramped, cluttered home without causing a blast, Prendergast said. Authorities also found inside the house some more hazardous chemicals, which also won't be moved for now, he said. The sheriff's department has secured a perimeter around the suburban house and closed the street off except to residents, Prendergast said. One explosives expert described the eight or nine pounds of previously discovered HMTD as potentially ""devastating."" ""If you had 8 or 9 pounds in a vehicle in a street, you have a pretty large and devastating car bomb,"" said James Cavanaugh, a retired special agent of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""Inside a home, it's going to blow all the windows and doors and walls out, but it's not going to destroy the neighborhood. People would be in danger if they were immediately in front of the house or adjacent to the house,"" he said. "" It would be almost like a gas explosion."" Bomb squads must be wary of potential booby traps, Cavanaugh said. ""These explosives, like HMTD, I call the devil's own mixtures, and they can be set off by shock, friction, static electricity, heat, flame or even a chemical reaction,"" he said. ""Added to the danger is that they are difficult to find in a filthy hoarder's hovel."" Outside court this week, Jakubec's wife, Marina Ivanova, was distraught. ""He's crazy,"" she told camera crews. ""I think he lost his mind. He lost his mind or something. ... I know that he was collecting, obsessively collecting stuff."" Bomb technicians must work slowly inside the house because the slightest friction -- such as opening a drawer -- could ignite the explosives, Prendergast said. Jakubec appears to be a hoarder, and the clutter of paper and boxes in the house makes the hunt for explosives more difficult, the assistant sheriff said. Bomb crews were wearing less gear so they can move about the house without brushing up against anything and accidentally triggering the explosives, he said. ""We are wearing some protective gear, not the big protective gear"" that resembles moon suits, Prendergast said. ""It's just not practical for this operation."" Authorities discovered the explosives last Thursday after a gardener was injured when he unwittingly set off some of the HMTD powder in the back yard, Prendergast said. The blast went up one side of his body, from lower leg to head, he said. ""We believe he scraped against some of the powder in the yard, and the friction caused it to explode,"" Prendergast said. ""Apparently the suspect was experimenting in his yard, and some of it got left over"" the ground, he added. The 8 or 9 pounds of HMTD was in six jars that had apparently been moved out of the house and into the back yard, he said. Last Friday, authorities had to evacuate two nearby houses and even closed down the southbound lanes of nearby Interstate 15 for three hours, he said. The two adjacent houses remained evacuated Wednesday, he said. ""It's amazing he didn't blow himself up. He must have some knowledge of how to do this safely,"" Prendergast said. ""Part of the story should be about the bravery of the bomb technicians and haz-mat team, for risking their lives trying to build a case against this guy so that justice can be served, and trying to render the site safe so that homeowners can return to their homes,"" he added. During Wednesday's search, only two or three bomb technicians entered the house for less than an hour and seized a computer and other items, Prendergast said. The crew videotaped the interior and will review the tape later to determine their next mission, officials said. In recent days, technicians found improvised grenades that weren't live, he said. ""If you look at the video of this, you can see items piled on top of items. It gives you a mental picture of how difficult it is,"" Prendergast said. ""Counter space and tables, every bit of space had items piled on top of items -- papers and boxes. ""We only pull things out that have easy access,"" he added. Law officers have defined ""a hot zone"" consisting of the house itself and the two nearby evacuated houses. A ""warm zone"" is the street in front of the house, and a ""cold zone"" is the area beyond a police tape where the media and public are allowed to stand, Prendergast said. At night, after bomb crews have finished their work, the hot zone is reduced to just the house, he said. Authorities said the HMTD discovered inside the house Wednesday is stored in a bottle. ""We have not removed it yet. It's too dangerous to move. Any movement can set it off,"" Prendergast said. ""We have a saying: We'll go as fast as we can but slow as we must,"" he added.","Authorities say a house holds a second homemade explosive, PETN .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The Netherlands froze all ties with Iran Sunday after Tehran hanged a Dutch-Iranian woman a day earlier, calling the execution a ""shocking act by a barbaric regime."" And Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal will ""discuss possible measures"" against Iran by the European Union on Monday, the foreign ministry said. Iran hanged Zahra Bahrami Saturday, saying she was a drug smuggler, the semi-official Fars news agency reported, although the Dutch government expressed ""great concern"" about her case three weeks ago. Fars said Bahrami smuggled cocaine into Iran with the help of a Dutch partner. But the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran suggested the drug charges were only a pretext to execute her. The campaign said Bahrami was originally charged with security offenses in the wake of widespread protests against the government over a controversial presidential election in June 2009. Her lawyer was ""shocked"" to find she had been hanged, the group said. ""I was absolutely not informed about this. They should have informed her lawyer of the execution, but I had no idea. I don't know what to say. Just that I am shocked,"" Jinoos Sharif Razi told the group. The campaign said it learned of the hanging from Bahrami's daughter. Bahrami was accused of bringing cocaine into the country twice and selling it. Cocaine and opium were found during a search of her house, Fars reported. Her sentence also included 70 lashes and a $1,400 fine, Fars reported. Fars added that during a search of her house, while she was charged with security crimes, 450 grams of cocaine and 420 grams of opium were discovered and, following further investigation, it was found that she had also distributed 150 grams of cocaine. Iran denied Bahrami access to Dutch consular assistance and would not let Dutch officials attend her trial because Tehran did not recognize her dual citizenship, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands said on January 5. 'I'm greatly concerned about Zahra Bahrami's situation, and I immediately asked the Iranian authorities to clarify the very disturbing reports that she had been condemned to death,"" Foreign Minister Rosenthal said in a statement at the time. It is not clear if Iran ever responded to the Dutch request. On Sunday, the Netherlands strongly advised Dutch-Iranian citizens not to travel to Iran. CNN's David Wilkinson contributed to this report.","NEW: The Netherlands vows to discuss possible EU measures against Iran Monday .

"(EW.com) -- In a surprisingly close race, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1"" held on to its box-office crown Friday by grossing $20.8 million, according to early estimates. That's a 66 percent drop from the fantasy film's opening last Friday, which was inflated due to an enormous turnout at Thursday midnight screenings. If ""Deathly Hallows"" follows the Thanksgiving trajectory of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" -- the last Potter film to open in November -- the PG-13 movie should finish the weekend with about $50 million. That would bring ""Deathly Hallows'"" 10-day tally to $220 million, making it the 10th greatest 10-day gross in box-office history and the best ever for a Potter flick. But Friday wasn't only a celebration for wizards, as Disney's animated musical ""Tangled"" came in close behind with $19.7 million. The PG movie, which debuted Wednesday, has grossed $39.7 million so far, and has a shot at overtaking ""Deathly Hallows"" for the three-day weekend. If that happens, it'd be due to one reason: incredible word-of-mouth. CinemaScore audiences rated the fairy-tale film an ""A+"" -- the first movie this year to garner the rare grade. Even more impressive is the fact that while moviegoers under the age of 25 rated ""Tangled"" an ""A,"" those over the age of 25 gave it an ""A+."" Clearly this retelling of Rapunzel is delivering for all age groups, and when that happens, watch out. ""Tangled"" is on pace to finish second this weekend with about $47 million, but again, it could very well upset Potter for first place. Seems the lesson here is: Never underestimate a woman with ridiculously long hair. The next five films are fairly clumped together, and their positions could swap by Sunday night. DreamWorks Animation's ""Megamind"" came in third on Friday, grossing $5.3 million for an actual increase of 41 percent from last week. In fourth place was the action thriller ""Unstoppable,"" which gained 13 percent from last week for $4.6 million. After that were this week's three other new releases. The Cher-Christina Aguilera musical ""Burlesque"" fared best, bringing in $4.5 million on Friday. Despite mediocre reviews, audiences liked the PG-13 film -- CinemaScore moviegoers graded it an ""A-."". The R-rated romantic comedy ""Love and Other Drugs,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, was next in sixth place with $3.8 million. And ""Faster,"" Dwayne Johnson's return to the action genre, rounded out the top seven with $3.2 million. 1. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1 -- $20.8 mil . 2. Tangled -- $19.7 mil . 3.

"(CNN) -- Less than a week after Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Washington, senior diplomats from China and the United States sat down in Beijing Friday to follow up on the visit and discuss other issues. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg met with Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo. The two were expected to discuss tensions between North Korea and South Korea and U.S.-China relations, among other issues. ""This year is the year of the rabbit, so we have to work very fast."" Steinberg said at the beginning of the meeting, which was later closed to reporters. ""The year of the rabbit is auspicious,"" Dai said. ""I'm confident this year will be even better for U.S.-China relations. I am hoping this new year the world will be a more tranquil place. Please convey my greetings to Secretary [of State Hillary] Clinton."" Chinese Vice Minister Cui Tiankai also was present at the meeting. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama hosted Hu in talks defined largely by economic issues. The two met behind closed doors at the White House for several hours as top officials from both countries worked to address issues tied to the global economic crisis, international security, the environment and human rights. Obama administration officials used the president's meeting with Hu to highlight economic progress between the two countries, announcing Beijing's approval of $45 billion in new contracts for U.S. companies to export goods to China. The contracts will support an estimated 235,000 American jobs, according to the White House. The two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights, but pledged to keep working on the matter in a ""frank and candid way,"" according to Obama. CNN's Jo Ling Kent contributed to this report.","Meeting follows Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit to Washington last week .

"(CNN) -- Myanmar convened its first parliament in more than two decades on Monday in the capital, Naypyidaw. Members are expected to vote for chairman and vice chairman during the session. November's elections, which were also the first in 20 years, drew fire from critics, who said the voting was aimed at creating a facade of democracy. The regime refused to allow international monitors to oversee the elections and would not allow international journalists to cover the voting from inside the country. Journalists who reported from inside Myanmar had to do so surreptitiously. The military junta also recently overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way that critics say was aimed at tightening the regime's grip. The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. Parliament began a day after opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy launched its first official website. ""A good communication system is essential to our endeavour to set up a people's network for democracy that will span the whole world,"" Suu Kyi said in a message on the site, which went live Sunday. ""By communication, through the web page, with strong supporters of our cause, as well as with those who want to know more about our movement for democracy and about the NLD, I believe we shall be able to achieve our goal of a democratic union at a faster pace."" The web address for the site is: www.nldburma.org. The daughter of General Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged Myanmar's regime over the years. For her efforts, she won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. She was released from house arrest on November 13, after spending most of the past 20 years under house arrest or in prison. Her release came after the national elections which her National League for Democracy party boycotted, describing them as a sham.","Session of parliament is the first in more than 20 years .

"(CNN) -- A 26-year police veteran who headed the Dallas Crime Stoppers has been indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the tipster-based crime fighting program, U.S. Attorney James T. Jacks of the Northern District of Texas said Thursday. Dallas Police Department Senior Cpl. Theadora Ross, 50, of Rowlett, Texas, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeff Kaplan on Wednesday, and she was released on bond, Jacks said in a statement. A co-defendant, Malva R. Delley, 36, of Dallas also was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, Jacks said. Between February 2005 and May 2010, the conspirators allegedly collected at least $250,000 in cash rewards for bogus tips, the prosecutor said in a statement. No arrests, which would have been false, were ever made, Jacks said. Crime Stoppers is a nationwide program that offers cash rewards for information from anonymous callers as long as the tip leads to the arrest and indictment of criminals, Jacks said. The program's Dallas office is funded by the North Texas Crime Commission (NTCC) as well as with fines levied by the Dallas and Collin County courts, private donations and fundraising, Jacks' statement said. Dallas police officers and the Dallas County Sheriff's deputies staff the program, Jacks said. According to the indictment, Ross worked at the Dallas Crime Stoppers office from 2003 to May 2010, and headed that office from March 2006 to May 2010, Jacks said. Any tipster calling Crime Stoppers receives a ""tip number,"" and the tipster then must regularly call the Crime Stoppers office to see if the information resulted in a reward, Jacks said. Ross and other officers determined which tips were eligible for a cash reward, based on whether an arrest or indictment of a particular subject was related to the tip, Jacks said. Ross selected the tips to be presented to the NTCC for approval of a cash reward, Jacks said. Once the NTCC gave its approval, the anonymous tipster could call Crime Stoppers with a previously assigned tip number and would be given a tip number and code word, Jacks said. The tip numbers and code words were emailed to JP Morgan Chase Bank, where the anonymous tipster was required to present the tip number and code word to collect the reward, Jacks said. Ross allegedly sent the bank the Crime Stoppers cash reward list that included legitimate code words as well as tip numbers and code words for tips that Ross had allegedly altered, Jacks said. Ross allegedly gave the bogus tip information to Delley, who would collect reward money from the bank, Jacks said. Ross allegedly instructed Delley to deposit the money into Ross' personal bank account or give the cash directly to Ross, Jacks charged. If convicted, Ross and Delley each could face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a $250,000 fine, Jacks said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Senior Cpl.

"(CNN)  -- New Chelsea signing Fernando Torres said his transfer deadline-day move to the English Premier League champions from division rivals Liverpool was a ""step forward"" in his career. After much media speculation over the striker's future, Torres joined the Blues on a five-and-half-year contract on Monday, in a deal secured just before the January transfer window came to a dramatic close. ""I felt that I needed a step forward in my career and for my ambition as a footballer,"" the 26-year-old Torres said in an interview with the club's official website on Tuesday. ""I am joining a team that is at the top level -- there is not another level after Chelsea,"" he added. ""When I played against Chelsea there was always a big motivation because it was a special game -- always one of the biggest games of the season. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to join Chelsea because I want to be part of this kind of team."" The Anfield club compensated for the departure of Torres by signing two new strikers shortly before the 23.00 GMT transfer deadline  -- Uruguay's Luis Suarez moved from Dutch-side Ajax while England's Andy Carroll signed from Newcastle. Chelsea meanwhile coupled their Torres capture by completing the signing of defender David Luiz from Portuguese club Benfica. The best and worst deals of a dramatic deadline day . The fee for Torres' transfer has not been disclosed although British newspaper The Daily Telegraph speculated he had cost $80 million -- a figure that would break the previous British record set when Manchester City paid $53 million for Brazil's Robinho in 2008. Chelsea's big-money signing had spent three-and-a-half years at Liverpool scoring 81 goals in 142 matches. But following the side's failure to qualify for the Champions League and poor form in the league, Torres felt he needed to move to have the chance to challenge for silverware. ""The Champions League is a big ambition, it is a very important competition,"" the former Atletico Madrid player said. ""But also Chelsea have the chance every season to win all the trophies that they play for, so when you have the chance to play in a team like this you cannot say no."" Ironically, Torres' first match in a Chelsea shirt could be against seventh-placed Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in a league clash on Sunday. It is not thought he will feature in Tuesday's away fixture against sixth-placed Sunderland. ""It is like the destiny,"" he said after a group of Liverpool fans were seen burning Torres' number nine shirt outside Anfield when the news of the transfer broke. ""It is not perfect for me but we will see what happens and I only have good words about Liverpool. They made me a top player and gave me the chance to play at the top level. I will never say anything bad about Liverpool, I have been very happy there. ""But now the history is different and I am playing for Chelsea. If I have the chance to play I will do my best for Chelsea and hopefully I can score."" Madrid-born Torres added that his move had been made easier thanks to the support he had received from the London-based club's loyal fans. ""They really want me and it is important you have the support of the people in the club, and the support of the fans -- I have seen them very, very happy with me for joining Chelsea. Now I am very happy to be a Chelsea player."" Will deadline-day spending buck European transfer downturn? With Torres' record-breaking deal and Liverpool reportedly paying in excess of $53 million for Carroll, the Premier League showed little sign of being affected by the current economic situation. According to statistics from UK business advisory firm Deloitte, English clubs spent a record $363 million in the mid-season transfer window -- smashing the previous record of $282 million set in January 2008, and far exceeding amounts spent by leagues in Spain, Italy and Germany. However, Dan Jones, a partner in Deloitte's Sports Business Group, said this can be solely put down to a handful of lucrative deals made by just four clubs. ""We were surprised to see more than $360 million spent in a January window for the first time, particularly after only around $48 million was spent in January last year,"" Jones told CNN in a statement. ""When you scratch beneath the surface you find that around 80% of the total spending is concentrated across Chelsea, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Manchester City -- and spread across only six players. ""So this was a particularly polarized window, with only a few clubs flexing their financial muscles, on what was a deafening final day of an otherwise quiet window.""","Fernando Torres speaks to Chelsea TV after signing for the club on Monday .

"(CNN) -- European Union finance ministers on Sunday agreed on an 85 billion euro (U.S. $113 billion) bailout package for Ireland. The announcement comes a day after protesters snarled the streets of Dublin. Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen requested the loan last Sunday after days of insisting Ireland did not need help. The three-year, joint IMF and euro-zone loan was offered as a way to stabilize financial markets in the region. The loan is to be used to immediately strengthen Ireland's banking system, and to allow the country to undertake ambitious fiscal adjustment, including deficit reduction, said Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup said. Another condition of the loan is that Ireland tackle labor reform, he said. Of the 85 billion euros, 10 billion will be made available for immediate recapitalization. Another 25 billion will be destined for banking system support, and the remaining 50 billion for the country's budget needs. ""The Irish authorities have today proposed a clear and realistic package of policies to restore Ireland's banking system to health and put its public finances on a sound footing,"" said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the IMF. ""Immediate actions to tackle vulnerabilities in the banks and the continued strong fiscal adjustment are set in a multi-year policy framework for sustained growth and job creation."" The approved bailout package will leave Ireland with a smaller, but more robust and better capitalized banking system, he added. The IMF will contribute 22.5 billion euros of the loan amount, a proposal expected to be approved by the fund in December. Another 45 billion euros will come from the European Union and bilateral European lenders, and the final 17.5 billion euros will come from the Irish themselves, via their cash reserves and other liquid assets. The Eurogroup also addressed the need for a mechanism to help out member countries in distress. On Sunday, the leaders said that last month they agreed on a European Financial Stabilization Mechanism that will be set up to aid countries in need, together with the IMF. ""The recent events have demonstrated that financial distress in one member state can rapidly threaten macro-financial stability of the EU as a whole through various contagion channels,"" the Eurogroup said in a statement. Irish government representatives had met Saturday night and were briefed on the negotiation ahead of the announcement, according to an Irish government statement. ""We're trying hard to find a solution and I hope tomorrow the financial markets will understand and see that the euro is a safe and stable currency now and for the future,"" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said as the finance ministers arrived to discuss the bailout. British Finance Minister George Osborne said that it is in Britain's and the entire region's interest to achieve economic stability in Ireland because of trade in the eurozone. ""I think we're going to make some very good progress today,"" he said. Cowen announced austerity measures during the week as the Irish government reels from the cost of saving its banks. The moves are unpopular in the country, and Cowen's party lost an election Thursday for a parliamentary seat. An estimated 50,000 people demonstrated against austerity in Dublin on Saturday. The protests were organized by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), which has called the four-year plan for spending cuts and tax hikes ""savage and regressive."" Families, retired people, the unemployed and members of unions and community groups were among the demonstrators who braved a rare dusting of snow to come out Saturday, the ICTU said. Cowen announced the budget-cutting plan this week after agreeing to a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund and European Union, needed to tackle Ireland's massive debt. The plan saves 10 billion euros ($13.4 billion) through welfare cuts and an additional 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) through higher taxes. There will be reductions in the minimum wage and public-sector pay, and a hike in the value-added tax on goods and services, Cowen said. The plan calls for introducing water meters, making students pay more for higher education, and requiring more Irish workers to pay income tax. Trade unions complain the plan unfairly targets lower-paid workers, while making no provision for a tax on asset wealth. They say it fails to explain how the Irish people can carry the banks' massive debts and sets out no strategy . for creating jobs. ""People are angry and they've had enough of this government,"" local journalist Juliette Gash told CNN. ""They're furious because they feel like the government has handed over the keys to the country."" Journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","European finance ministers announce 85 billion euro bailout .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals panel on Wednesday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that halted enforcement of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy banning openly gay and lesbian soldiers from the military. The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals gave the government the delay it sought in challenging a federal judge's order last week to stop enforcing the policy around the world. ""The order is stayed temporarily in order to provide this court with an opportunity to consider fully the issues presented,"" said the appellate panel's ruling, which gave parties in the case until October 25 to file further documents. CNN iReport: Please share your thoughts on don't ask, don't tell . Aubrey Sarvis, an Army veteran and executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, said the appeals court panel's ruling ""means that 'don't ask, don't tell' is once again on the books, and is likely to be enforced by the Defense Department."" ""Gay and lesbian service members deserve better treatment than they are getting with this ruling,"" Sarvis said. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Campaign also expressed disappointment and called for an end to ""don't ask, don't tell."" Earlier Wednesday, the Obama administration filed an emergency request with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to stop the military from allowing openly gay troops from serving, putting itself in a strange position. In effect, the administration wants to continue barring gays from the military even though it ultimately favors repealing ""don't ask, don't tell."" ""They are in a very bizarre position, frankly, of their own making,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. On Wednesday, the White House referred all questions about the issue to the Department of Justice. The administration filed a motion Tuesday asking U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Phillips to stay her order last month that banned the enforcement of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. When Phillips denied the request, government lawyers took their case to the 9th Circuit on Wednesday. In court documents filed in San Francisco, California, the administration argued that ""don't ask, don't tell"" should remain intact for now. The administration argued that changing it abruptly ""risks causing significant immediate harm to the military and its efforts to be prepared to implement an orderly repeal of the statute."" Toobinsaid the administration would like Congress to deal with the issue on a political level and doesn't want the courts to take it on unilaterally. A measure that would repeal the policy after a military review and approval from the president, defense secretary and Joint Chiefs chairman has passed the House and awaits action in the Senate. By battling the legal challenge to the existing law -- a traditional practice of the U.S. government -- the administration is trying to buy time to implement the repeal process worked out with military leaders and contained in the legislation before Congress. If the 9th Circuit eventually overturns Phillips' ruling and Congress does not take any action, ""don't ask, don't tell"" could be back. ""And the Obama administration would be responsible for that,"" Toobin said. Meanwhile, spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said Wednesday that the Defense Department ""will continue to obey the law, and we will abide by the terms of the court's injunction unless and until the injunction is stayed or vacated."" The Log Cabin Republicans, plaintiffs in the case that Phillips ruled on, said Wednesday that the group remained fully committed to defending this worldwide injunction because it is what is best for all service members. ""While we are disappointed with the court's ruling granting a temporary administrative stay, we view the decision as nothing more than a minor setback,"" said Dan Woods, a partner in the law firm White & Case who is representing the group it the case. ""We didn't come this far to quit now,"" he said in a statement, adding that the group expected the appeals court to uphold the lower court injunction against ""don't ask, don't tell."" The Pentagon has already begun advising recruiting commands that they can accept openly gay and lesbian recruit candidates, according to Smith. The guidance from the personnel and readiness office was sent to recruiting commands Friday, Smith said. The recruiters were told that if a candidate admits that he or she is openly gay and qualifies under normal recruiting guidelines, the application can be processed. Recruiters are not allowed to ask candidates if they are gay as part of the application process. Christian Berle, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, said there have not been any incidents of consequence the administration feared would occur. ""The armed forces continues to move along and succeed because it is the greatest military in the world,"" Berle said. Dan Choi, an infantry officer who was discharged under the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, turned in paperwork Wednesday to re-enlist in the Army. He said the Obama administration ought not to lift a finger to defend discrimination. ""They should walk their talk,"" Choi said after re-enlisting. The Obama administration has said it needs more time to work with the Pentagon to repeal the policy, blasted by critics as blatantly discriminatory. ""This president has made a commitment, and it's not a question of whether that program, whether that policy will change, but when,"" Obama adviser David Axelrodsaid. ""We're at the end of a process with the Pentagon to make that transition, and we're going to see it through."" The arrangement worked out with the Pentagon includes a military review of how to make the transition work, which is to be completed in December. After that, Obama, the defense secretary and the Joint Chiefs chairman would have to certify that the plan won't harm the combat readiness of U.S. troops. Obama and White House Press Secretary Robert Gates have repeatedly stressed the need for an orderly transition from the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in order to deal with myriad issues including barracks arrangements and benefits. Speaking to a mostly young audience at the MTV, BET, CMT town hall meeting last week, Obama reaffirmed that the ""policy will end and it will end on my watch."" ""I agree with the basic principle that anybody who wants to serve in our armed forces and make sacrifices on our behalf, on behalf of our national security, anybody should be able to serve,"" he said. At the same time, Obama said, ""it has to be done in a way that is orderly,"" and he insisted that congressional action is needed because Congress passed a law that prohibits the president from unilaterally changing the policy. CNN's Adam Levine, Dan Lothian and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: ACLU, service members group express disappointment .

"(CNN) -- After 40 years of appearing on the silver screen, actor Amitabh Bachchan is the elder statesman of Indian cinema and is possibly the most recognized man in India. The Big B: The patriarch of Indian cinema has appeared in over 180 films. Born to a famous Indian poet, Bachchan made his screen debut at the age of 27 and has gone on to star in over 180 films. As such an established star he has seen Indian film making change over the years, weathered changing audience tastes and the evolution of Bollywood cinema. ""I'm actually very happy with our content. Even though we were ridiculed, and the West were very cynical about the way we made our films and the content that it contained,"" he told CNN. ""But that very aspect has now become its USP (unique selling point) almost, and people love to see that. I would not want to change that. I would expect that this is how and what our cinema is all about."" If Indian films have gained a new found international interest, the way that Indian films are produced has also changed. From the industry's alleged connection to organized crime to better production quality, Bachchan has worked within the system and at the sharp end of making movies. ""We have our own modes of working and how does one actually decipher that the person that you're working with has some kind of an underground link? You know, 'I am mafia' doesn't come written on somebody's forehead. ""Whether he, you know, collects his money from wherever it is ... is really not our concern. We are interested the story, the concept, in our roles, the director who's going to be making it, in the creative aspect. That's it, "" he said. The role that propelled him to superstardom was of a working class hero standing up to oppression and injustice in the 1975 film ""Sholay"". ""During the 1970s there was a feeling of great dissatisfaction in the youth that the establishment of the system is not doing enough to take care of their issues and problems. When one individual stood out and challenged the system and came out victorious he suddenly became a hero,"" he told CNN. ""I fortunately happened to be the actor that they chose to represent that kind of philosophy or thinking. And therefore I became a beneficiary."" From being the ""angry young man"" of cinema in India he is now more commonly known as ""The Big B"" to the media and his millions of fans. But being such a public figure has never been a problem; Bachchan writes a daily blog and believes that it's in an actor's make-up to thrive in public attention and that stars should be able to deal with praise as well as criticism. ""I think we all live to be recognized ... creativity would be useless if no one ever saw it or recognized it. We want our work to be known. ""I enjoy my blog greatly because I invite comment. Not all of them are complimentary, many of them are abusive, but I never moderate it because I think it's important to know what the rest of the world actually thinks about you."" Taking the good with the bad, Bachchan was recently criticized for reportedly being less than impressed by Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning film, ""Slumdog Millionaire."" But says Bachchan the unnecessary controversy was because of comments from readers on his blog had been mistakenly attributed to him. ""I was wrongly accused. I did get to see the film. I thought it was a very well made film, great story,"" he told CNN. If ""Slumdog Millionaire"" illustrates current interest in Indian films by the West, Indian movies have also developed in ways more familiar to Hollywood movies. ""Life has become a lot faster. We've had to move with the times and adjust. If you were to analyze an indie film of the 1970s ... there would be far, far less editing cuts of, say, a film that was released in 2009. That philosophy [from TV editing], for some peculiar reason, has now translated into the minds of the audiences and they expect the same kind of treatment when they go out to see a movie,"" he told CNN.","Indian actor has been superstar of Bollywood cinema for 40 years .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Several hundred protesters braved rain and cold temperatures here in the capital to protest against Jordan's new prime minister Friday. The demonstration, called by the Islamic Action Front, passed off without incident amid a low-profile police presence. The protesters chanted ""Alahu Akhbar"" (""God is Great""), demanded political reforms and railed against government corruption. Most of them marched from Friday prayers at Salahuddin Mosque the short distance to the office of Prime Minister Marouf Bakhit, who was appointed by King Abdullah II a few days ago. They then moved on to the Egyptian embassy before dispersing. It was the smallest Friday demonstration in Amman in several weeks. Other groups involved in previous protests decided not to join this week, leaving the Islamists and a small leftist party as the only groups involved. Earlier this week, King Abdullah promised the new government would launch a national dialogue on political reform, tackle corruption and review Jordan's restrictive election law to involve a wider range of political opinion. The king met with Islamist leaders Thursday, among them the leadership of the Islamic Action Front and Muslim Brotherhood. Afterwards, the Islamists described the meeting as ""clear and frank"" in which they asked for political reform beginning with a new more democratic election law and a government chosen by Parliament rather than the king. The Palace said the king had emphasized inclusive reforms that could overcome ""external forces"" who are resisting change for their own personal interests. The general secretary of the Islamic Action Front, Hamza Mansour, told CNN Thursday that democracy in Jordan was marginalized and warned that when political and economical conditions worsen, social violence surfaces.","Protesters are demaning political reforms .

"Washington (CNN) -- The family of a man who fought alongside U.S. troops in Vietnam have been told their relative will not be allowed to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Major General Vang Pao led thousands of Hmong soldiers as they fought alongside the United States against the North Vietnamese Army during the war in Southeast Asia, according to a news release from Congressman Jim Costa of California. Costa, on behalf of Pao's family, asked the Army to grant an exception to Arlington's rules to allow Pao to be buried in the nation's most hallowed burial ground. Pao died recently of complications from pneumonia, according to Costa. ""The Vang Pao family's request for an exception to the burial policy was thoroughly reviewed by a board comprised of senior military and civilian officials. ... After a comprehensive analysis, the board unanimously recommended denial of the request for exception to policy. Upon receipt of the board's input, the Secretary carefully reviewed and deliberated on this matter and accepted the board's recommendation,"" according to a statement from the Army released Friday evening. According to the cemetery's policy, Pao would have had to have served in the U.S. armed forces to be eligible for the honor. The family can still ask Defense Secretary Robert Gates and President Obama to make an exception. A Pentagon spokesman said he did not know if any request regarding Pao's burial had reached Gates as of Friday afternoon.","Vang Pao fought alongside U.S. troops in the Vietnam War .

"(CNN) -- A Texas produce distributor has recalled nearly 7,000 cases of cilantro and curly parsley after samples in Quebec, Canada, and Michigan tested positive for salmonella, the company said Monday. The latest recall comes days after dozens of people fell sick after consuming bacteria-tainted alfalfa sprouts in an apparently unrelated situation. The ""precautionary, voluntary recall"" announced Monday pertains to cilantro and parsley from J&D Produce, Inc., packed between November 30 and December 6, the Edinburg, Texas-based company said in a statement. Cilantro and parsley processed and branded as Little Bear between those dates can be taken to retailers for a full refund. No one has reported getting sick from eating the vegetables, according to J&D Produce. Also Monday, the Food and Drug Administration announced a source of a salmonella outbreak that had sickened at least 89 people in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Health officials said those first cases became known November 1, with many getting ill after eating alfalfa sprouts in products from Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches outlets. The FDA said Monday that those vegetables came from Tiny Greens Organic Farm. Tiny Greens' alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts (which have alfalfa sprouts plus radish and clover sprouts) were distributed in 4-ounce and 5-pound containers to farmers' markets, grocery stores and restaurants including Jimmy John's. In addition to a variety of sprouts, the Urbana, Illinois, produce company distributes arugula, broccoli, fennel, cauliflower, onion, radish and other items, according to its website. In a letter to Jimmy John's franchisees, founder Jimmy John Liautaud said that the chain had pulled sprouts from all its Illinois establishments after store locations came up negative for the bacteria. About 23% of those sickened in that outbreak were hospitalized, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last Thursday. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak. The FDA said Monday that the sprouts were distributed in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and possibly other Midwestern states, with roughly half the illnesses occurring in Illinois. The separate J&D Produce recall, meanwhile, came after independent tests found salmonella on the company's parsley in Quebec and its cilantro in Detroit, Michigan, both of which came from the same processing line in Texas. The company's products are sold retail as well as to wholesalers, who may then distribute them to restaurants and other establishments, according to Sharon McNerney, a public relations consultant for the company. The recall involves 2,498 cases of the parsley -- which have expiration dates 12 days after being packed -- that went out to the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario and the U.S. states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The 4,411 recalled cases of cilantro, carrying the same packing and expiration dates, were distributed in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin as well as Quebec and Ontario . After the positive results, regulators and health officials in the United States and Canada have stepped up inspections of J&D Produce's facilities, the company's president, James Bassetti, said. They also undertook other measures, including stopping and sanitizing all production lines, adding manual inspections, rinsing products more and bringing in consultants. ""We have a good track record, but we'll bring our expectations and standards to even higher levels,"" he said. ""We've already begun improving our systems."" In addition to cilantro and parsley, the Texas company gathers, packs and distributes a variety of fruits and vegetables such as carrots, limes, eggplants, peppers, greens, onions, melons, mangos and asparagus, according to its website. Those with questions can call J&D Produce at 956-380-0353. Salmonella is a bacterial infection that usually lasts four to seven days. About 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported each year in the United States, according to the CDC. Those who get it typically develop fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Most people recover on their own, without needing significant treatment. But salmonella in very young and very old people, as well as those with weakened immune systems, can lead to severe illness and even death. The CDC recommends that anyone suspecting he or she may be ill from eating contaminated food should talk to a doctor.","NEW: A recall of parsley and cilantro affects 14 states and 2 Canadian provinces .

"(WIRED)  -- For those of you with lengthy tech-toy wish lists and not-so-deep pockets, T-Mobile's new tablet offering may provide the answer you've been waiting for. Beginning February 2, the Dell Streak 7 tablet will be available for $200, after a $50 mail-in rebate and two-year contract, T-Mobile has announced. Off-contract, the tablet will retail for $450. The new 7-inch Streak is a bump up in size from Dell's last 5-inch offering, as well as a dip in price from the $300 charged for the 5-inch AT&T version. But unlike its teensy predecessor, the Streak 7 will be able to connect to T-Mobile's HSPA+ 4G network -- although as we've recently noted, the term ""4G"" seems to be in the eye of the beholder. We got our hands on the Streak 7 today, and our first impressions are generally positive. It's chunkier in shape than the iPad, but with rounder edges than the Galaxy Tab. It rests comfortably in one hand or two, suggesting it will serve just as well for passive reading and video watching as it will for more-active browsing. The interface will be familiar to anyone who's used Android, and neither T-Mobile nor Dell have mucked up the basic operating system with too many widgets. The screen is bright and somewhat responsive, although it's a little ""jumpy."" While the screen moves quickly, it's not quite as smooth as the iPad at tracking your finger motions when you swipe or pinch the screen. It's as if the makers decided to compensate for the touchscreen's lack of sensitivity by making the screen move faster, and the result is that the screen sometimes feels as if it's jumping ahead of your finger. Web browsing and video playback were all quite smooth, and stereo speakers built into the case provide decent if somewhat anemic audio. The Streak will come packing one of Nvidia's much-hyped dual-core Tegra 2 processors, while touting the suite of recent tablet debut standards -- SD card slot, Wi-Fi access, Bluetooth 2.1 connectivity, 5-megapixel back-facing camera for photos and 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera with video-chat capability. T-Mobile is targeting the lower-priced end of the tablet market with the $200 tag, beating out the Samsung Galaxy Tab, which recently dropped its sticker price to $250, after a $50 mail-in rebate. Though the Streak's off-contract $450 isn't exactly a bargain-basement price, its still 50 bucks cheaper than the lowest-priced iPad. The Streak 7's debut comes at the forefront of a 2011 tablet-debut onslaught. Rumors of a March release for HP's new webOS-powered ""Topaz"" have been circulating recently, with the Android-fueled Motorola Xoom soon to follow. While the Streak may have a leg up on Motorola in terms of pricing -- leaked screenshots suggest a hefty $800 price tag for the tablet on debut -- it might be at a disadvantage running the antiquated Android version 2.2 (Froyo) against the version 3.0 Honeycomb-powered Xoom. But despite version-fragmentation issues, a relatively low-cost option like the Streak 7 may be impetus enough for shoppers to jump on one of the first big tablet offerings of the year.

"(CNN) -- Northern Michigan University officials say the situation ""is under control"" after a telephone threat against students, faculty and others prompted a lockdown of the Marquette, Michigan, campus Wednesday morning. However officials continued to urge students to remain in their dormitories and visitors to stay away from the campus until further notice. The administration closed the university at 8:20 a.m. Wednesday after campus police learned of a telephone caller who had earlier threatened to attack NMU. Cindy Paavola, the university's director of community relations, said campus police took the threat seriously, thus prompting the administration to close the university as a precautionary measure. ""The caller threatened that there would be harm to students, faculty, staff and administrators,"" Paavola said. ""They didn't identify particular people, but it was a wide-ranging threat and we are taking it seriously."" ""We don't know the seriousness of the threat because we haven't caught up with this person. Rather than be sorry, we're going to be safe,"" Paavola said. State and local law enforcement authorities are assisting university police in the investigation, she added. The Marquette Area Public Schools also sent students and staff home, interim superintendent Debra Veiht told CNN. She said police referred to a threat on a blog, which they deemed credible. ""We put in our emergency plan into place and it's running smoothly,"" Veiht said. The public school system has more than 3,000 students and 400 staff members, she said. The Marquette Senior High School is located about a half-block away from the university. University officials locked down all buildings so no one could enter or leave, and told students living on campus to stay in their dormitories. Paavola said several office buildings were evacuated Wednesday morning. CNN's Chris Kokenes contributed to this report .","NEW: Northern Michigan University police say situation is under control .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Opposition leaders and intellectuals met with Egypt's vice president Saturday to discuss avenues for easing embattled President Hosni Mubarak from power, the number one demand of of tens of thousands of demonstrators. Among the proposals under discussion is Article 139 of the constitution, which allows for the vice president to assume control if the president is no longer able. At least one opposition group, the leftist Tagammu party, is asking the government to activate the article's powers so that Suleiman can take charge immediately and allow Mubarak to make a graceful exit. A member of the self-declared Committee of the Wise, told CNN that Suleiman was willing to listen. The group of independent elites -- intellectuals, artists, diplomats and businessmen -- wants to be at the table during crucial government transition talks. They called on protests to continue at Tahrir Square every Tuesday and Friday until Mubarak ""resigns and makes true the demands of the people."" Mubarak, said the committee, can remain as a symbolic leader but should delegate to Suleiman responsibility for the transition period. Saturday's talks were taking place as crowds massed again in downtown Cairo's Tahrir Square for a 12th day of protests demanding an end to Mubarak's 30-year authoritarian rule over the Arab world's most populous nation. After chaos and bloodshed earlier in the week, Cairo remained calm Saturday. Cars traveled over a nearby overpass in the central city. Outside the Egyptian Museum, people prayed as soldiers stood guard. Protesters who had spent the night swept sidewalks with palm branches and bought food from carts stationed in the square. The justice minister announced that courts would reopen Sunday and the government eased its daily curfew now imposed from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. ""We're in better shape,"" Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq said on state television. ""And we can sense that day by day."" Heavy military presence persisted on the streets of central Cairo. Interior Ministry spokesman Ismail Othman said ""the army remains neutral and is not taking sides because if we protect one side we will be perceived as biased.... our role is to prevent clashes and chaos as we separate the opposing groups."" But in a scene exposing how volatile the situation remains, demonstrators formed a human chain to prevent tanks from passing through the barricades into the anti-Mubarak enclave in Tahrir Square. A witness said scuffles broke out when an army general asked demonstrators to take down their make-shift barricades of corrugated steel and debris, put up during the 48 hours of fighting near the landmark Egyptian Museum. And hours earlier, gunshots rang out as protesters said scores of Mubarak defenders tried to assault the square early Saturday morning. Troops fired into the air to disperse them, according to the protesters. Meanwhile, Mohamed ElBaradei's National Association for Change and the Tagammu party's leader announced a newly formed opposition group of 10 people, including ElBaradei, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Beltagy and liberal Ghad party leader Ayman Nour. They called for Mubarak's immediate resignation and the right for peaceful demonstration. ""We have been in agreement right now that we'd probably have a presidential council of three members including somebody from the army,"" ElBaradei told CNN. ""We have a caretaker government ... who would then run the country for a year, prepare the grounds for the necessary changes in the electoral process to ensure that we will have all what we need for a free and fair election,"" he said. Tagammu and the liberal Wafd party met with Suleiman Saturday, buoyed by the government's promises to investigate the bloodshed at Tahrir Square. At least 11 people were killed and more than 900 injured, according to the Health Ministry. Many believe the violence was instigated by government provocateurs. But some opposition groups are refusing to come to the table until Mubarak steps down. ""The so-called dialogue is the first step to exhaust this revolution. The president must go,"" said Mohammed Habib, deputy chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood, an opposition Islamist umbrella group that if officially banned but tolerated in Egypt. The group reported that a security force accompanied by a ""gang of thugs"" stormed the office of its news website Friday and arrested the journalists, technicians and administrators. The Al-Jazeera news network reported a similar attack on its Cairo office. Those attacks came after two days of violence and a government crackdown on journalists and human rights activists bearing witness to the crisis. Some had predicted the demonstrations might lose their momentum. But Friday, dubbed the ""Day of Departure"" saw massive crowds gather in Cairo and other Egyptian cities to demand change. CNN's Amir Ahmed, Frederik Pleitgen and Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","NEW: Demonstrators try to prevent tanks from passing in Tahrir Square .

"(Mental Floss)  -- Some companies find their niche and stick to it. Others, though, have to adapt to changing markets in order to thrive. Here's a look at some companies that switched industries at some point in their histories, usually for the better. Tiffany's may know how to prettily wrap jewelry because the company began in the paper business. 1. Avon . David H. McConnell started Avon in 1886 without really meaning to. McConnell sold books door-to-door, but to lure in female customers he offered little gifts of perfume. Before long, the perfume McConnell was giving away had become more popular than the books he was selling, so he shifted focus and founded the California Perfume Company, which later became Avon. 2. Nokia . The telecom giant got its start in Finland in 1865, when Fredrik Idestam opened a pulp mill and started making paper on the banks of Tammerkoski. The company later bounced around a number of industries before getting serious about phones in the 1960s. 3. 3M . When the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company's founders opened their business in Two Harbors, Minnesota, in 1902, they weren't selling Post-It Notes. The partners originally planned to sell the mineral corundum, an important ingredient in building grinding wheels, directly to manufacturers. 4. Berkshire Hathaway . The sprawling holding company helmed by Warren Buffett was originally a textile manufacturer that took off in 1839. Buffett took control in 1962, though, and by 1967 he started to move outside of textiles into insurance and other sectors. Mental Floss: Ginsu Knives, Dairy Queen and what else Warren Buffett owns . 5. Wrigley . Like Avon, the chewing gum company got its start with a popular freebie. William Wrigley, Jr. founded the company in 1891 with the goal of selling soap and baking powder. He offered chewing gum as an enticement to his customers, and eventually the customers didn't care about the baking powder; they only wanted the gum. 6. Tiffany & Co. The jewelry and silverware hot bed was originally a stationer called Tiffany, Young, and Ellis when it started in 1837. In 1853 Tiffany switched its core business and began focusing on jewelry. 7. Coleco . The defunct electronics corporation actually began as a leather goods company in Connecticut in 1932. In the early days it was known as the Connecticut Leather Company, which was later shortened to ""Coleco."" 8. Hasbro . The company behind Transformers and G.I. Joes began in 1923 as Hassenfeld Brothers. The titular brothers didn't make toys, though; they sold textile remnants. Their business gradually shifted into school supplies before making the leap to toys after the 1952 introduction of Mr. Potato Head. Mental Floss: How 10 classic toys were invented . 9. Raytheon . The defense contractor started up in 1922 as the American Appliance Company, which worked on refrigeration technology. Eventually the company branched out into other areas of electronics and became Raytheon in 1925. 10. Colgate . The hygienic products company got its start in 1806, but it didn't make its first toothpaste until 1873. Founder William Colgate initially manufactured soap, candles, and starch. 11. Xerox . When Xerox got off the ground in 1906, it was as a maker of photographic paper and photography equipment called the Haloid Company. The company didn't introduce what we would think of as a copier until the Xerox 914 made its debut in 1959. 12. John Deere . The man behind the giant fleet of green tractors got his start as a blacksmith in Grand Detour, Illinois. After struggling to make plows that could cut through the area's tough clay, Deere hit on the idea of building plows out of cast steel, and his blacksmith gig gave way to a booming farm-supply business. 13. Reading Entertainment . Remember the Reading Railroad from the last time you played Monopoly? The company still (sort of) exists! The Reading Company got out of the railroad business in 1976 but was reborn as Reading Entertainment, which operates movie theaters mainly in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. Mental Floss: 11 things Wal-Mart has banned . 14. Abercrombie & Fitch . When David Abercrombie founded the clothing store in 1892 in New York City, he wasn't dreaming of clothing high school and college students everywhere. The store was originally a sporting goods shop and outfitter; Abercrombie even outfitted Charles Lindbergh for his famous flight across the Atlantic. The version Abercrombie & Fitch you see in your local mall started to come about after Limited Brands bought the company in 1988. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's chances of retaining the English Premier League title suffered another setback on Sunday as struggling Aston Villa snatched a last-gasp 3-3 draw in London. Carlo Ancelotti's team had fought back to lead 3-2 with two goals in the last 10 minutes, but poor defending allowed young Villa fullback Ciaran Clark to equalize with a free header in the second minute of time added on. The result left Chelsea in fifth place, a point behind Tottenham and six adrift of the leading Manchester clubs United and City. The Blues ended 2010 with a morale-boosting win over Bolton last Wednesday, and looked like extending that form when Frank Lampard scored his first goal since returning from long-term injury in the 23rd minute. The influential midfielder netted a penalty after James Collins was punished for a clumsy shove from behind on Florent Malouda, but Villa equalized four minutes before halftime when Ashley Young smashed home another spotkick following Michael Essien's foul on Nigel Reo-Coker. New year, new Rooney as United stay top . Former England striker Emile Heskey put Villa ahead two minutes after the break with a powerful header from Stewart Downing's cross, but Chelsea's relentless pressure finally told in the 84th minute when Didier Drogba fired home a low shot after the visitors could not clear his clever chest-down to Malouda. Defender John Terry then popped up to slot in a rare goal with a minute to go in regulation time after Villa's otherwise excellent goalkeeper Brad Friedel could only parry Drogba's header into the former England captain's path. That sparked scenes of jubilation and relief on the Chelsea bench, but Villa left Ancelotti's future in some doubt when the 21-year-old Clark stole into the penalty area unmarked to head home a teasing cross from substitute Marc Albrighton. Chelsea have now won only once in eight league games, having played one more game than United -- a situation that is unlikely to please the club's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich. ""We needed to win this game. We didn't and now it's more difficult to prepare for the next game,"" Italian coach Ancelotti told reporters. ""I'm disappointed because we worked very hard in the second half to come back into the game when 2-1 down. We did a fantastic job, we came back and scored to make it 3-2 and everyone thought the game was finished."" While Ancelotti will have to face more questions about his increasingly insecure tenure, the result lifted the pressure on Villa's French manager Gerard Houllier, whose team moved two points clear of the bottom three. Football's heroes and villains of 2010 . ""It's a massive point,"" American veteran Friedel told match broadcaster Sky Sports. ""We've been in such a bad run of form we needed something, and it's great to get it at Stamford Bridge. ""We've got over what I thought was a poor penalty decision against us at the start and we've fought back, and hopefully this will kick-start our season and we can get back up the table."" In Sunday's late game, Newcastle won 1-0 at Wigan to give new manager Alan Pardew his second victory after two successive defeats. Striker Shola Ameobi, playing alone up front in place of England striker Andy Carroll, scored a 19th-minute winner from close range after Joey Barton's shot was blocked and Peter Lovenkrands poked the follow-up against the post. Newcastle moved up to 10th place, above Blackpool on goal difference but below Liverpool, to be six points clear of the bottom three. Defenders Steven Taylor and Fabricio Coloccini headed against the bar, while Gary Caldwell struck the woodwork for Wigan, who remained just a point above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Celtic moved four points clear in the Scottish Premier League with a 2-0 victory at defending champions Rangers as Greece striker Giorgios Samaras netted both goals, the second from the penalty spot after he was fouled. Rangers have played two fewer games than their Glasgow rivals following recent postponements due to snowy weather in Britain.","Aston Villa deny Chelsea a much-needed victory with a late equalizer in six-goal thriller .

"(CNN) -- The sisters Kardashian -- Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe -- don't have to spend millions on focus groups and dynamic PR strategists to get noticed: Twitter does it for them. In an interview to air on Thursday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" Morgan pointed out that all three are in the top 100 list of people being followed on Twitter worldwide: Kourtney is number 72, Khloe is number 47, and Kim is the sixth-most followed. With 6 million followers, she's neck and neck with President Barack Obama. Kourtney called Twitter ""the best decision-maker,"" pointing out that she Tweets everything from potential perfume bottle designs for the sisters' signature fragrance, to outfit dilemmas, to asking fans what she should have for dinner. Morgan, who has only been on Twitter for six weeks, has more than 200,000 followers, and asked Kim and Kourtney to help him gain more, pointing out that the sisters' influence was ""fascinating."" In light of the fact that their opinions are clearly in demand, Morgan asked them about Obama and Sarah Palin, stating, ""What would you say if I said, 'Sarah Palin'?"" To which Kourtney replied, ""I just think, like, hunter. That's just like the first thing that comes into my head. Kim said that Obama was the first presidential candidate to get her ""motivated enough to vote."" When Morgan asked Kourtney and Kim if they would have any talent if they were to appear on ""America's Got Talent,"" Kim Kardashian said, ""I would absolutely say that marketing is a skill."" Kim also said that ""fashion"" was a skill, pointing out that the sisters all worked as stylists at some point and that they currently own ""three successful clothing stores."" The Kardashians pointed out that much of their brand revolves around promoting a healthy body image and that none of the three sisters are ""stick skinny."" Kourtney admitted that while she is, in fact, a size zero, she is also very petite at 5 feet tall, and curvy. Kim, at 5-foot-3, said her size wavers between the 4 and 6 range. ""We're not trying to fit in the same mold,"" said Kim. ""We know that we feel our best when we look our best."" Kim said she is always ""super honest"" when plastic surgery rumors surface and had no trouble admitting that while she has ""tried Botox before,"" her breasts are ""completely, 100 percent real."" Kourtney admitted she does, in fact, have implants. Kim also said she often uses body shapers, masking tape, and other under-clothing body smoothers to boost her confidence -- particularly on the red carpet. ""If you know your body type,"" said Kim, ""then you can dress to feel -- its like, 'Fake it until you make it' is what we always say."" When Morgan asked them what the most extravagant thing they ever bought for themselves was, Kim said she had purchased a $115,000 watch that she ""got a really good deal on."" Even the most savvy pop culture connoisseurs may not realize that Ryan Seacrest is the Kardashians' boss. Seacrest has served as executive producer of the E! network's ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" since the reality series premiered in 2007. ""He is pretty evil,"" joked Kim. The Kardashians count Seacrest among their greatest friends. ""Ryan is so easy to talk to. He just gets it,"" said Kim. ""He completely trusts us and our vision."" Morgan also asked the Kardashians if there is anything about their lives that is off-limits. ""Relationships,"" said Kim. ""I only show very little bits and pieces."" When Morgan asked Kim if she was ""in love"" with New Jersey Nets player Kris Humphries, Kim was tight-lipped. ""I think that this time around, I am really trying to keep things a little bit more private than I have in the past,"" she said. The Kardashians were quick to point out that their solid American values and work ethic keep them grounded. Kim, who said she ""never"" talks money because she thinks its ""inappropriate,"" maintains that she gives 10 percent of her yearly income to her church because that's how she was raised. ""Whatever it is, I give 10 percent away to the church, and that's what I was taught."" When asked if she did the same, Kourtney said, ""I'm going to now,"" with a laugh.

"(CNN) -- Mark Webber has a maiden Formula One title in his sights to banish memories of an agonizing end to his 2010 campaign. The Australian led the crivers' championship for Red Bull for most of the season only to be pipped at the post by team-mate Sebastian Vettel, who secured the title in the final race at Abu Dhabi. Webber's year was dominated by controversy, as he accused his team of treating him as a ""number two driver"" and had a high-profile collision with Vettel in the Turkish Grand Prix which cost them both the chance of victory. But despite missing out on the F1 crown, the 34-year-old says he has moved on from the disappointment of his near miss. ""I'm completely over it,"" he told the official Formula one website. ""Life goes on and I don't feel any regret. It was quite a season. It was an incredible year. ""I lost the championship in the last race and over the whole season no one had a one-race lead over the other guys fighting for the title. I still think I had the opportunity to be the champion, but I didn't do it because I didn't get the job done on the track. ""Every race was alive. Even if we'd had one more race after Abu Dhabi four guys could have still won the championship. He (Vettel) did a great job and deserved the championship. ""There been a lot of great moments for me, but of course I didn't get the jackpot. But I am still very proud of what happened. I am definitely looking to improve this year."" Away from the track, the relationship between Webber and Vettel was a running theme throughout the season as the pressure of the title race set in. But Webber says it is important for Red Bull that he and Vettel enjoy a harmonious start to the season. He said: ""I would say our relationship is pretty good at the moment. We had some contact over the winter -- not a huge amount, but enough I would say to have a good start into the season. ""I am not stupid and know that harmony in the team is important and the drivers play a key role in this. What is important is that we don't destabilize the team."" Red Bull were propelled into the limelight as their drivers finished first and second in the title race, while the team romped away with the constructors' championship. And Webber says Red Bull will come back stronger in 2011 as a result of the pressure they experienced during a record breaking season. ""Of course you always learn from such a situation. Probably everybody does -- not only the drivers. It was a new situation for us -- suddenly being the pacemaker on the grid. ""In the end it was a very, very successful season for the team so I would say we managed all the hiccups perfectly. You need to be flexible and adjust to what might happen. ""That's what we've learnt as a team. It was a new situation for everybody in the team, from the drivers to the management to everybody on the floor.""","Mark Webber aiming to end his Formula One title drought in the upcoming season .

"(CNN) -- Medical workers expressed alarm Friday over the increase in hospitalizations and deaths in Haiti's cholera outbreak as the earthquake-devastated nation's already strained health system overflowed with the sick. On the outskirts of the capital city of Port-au-Prince in the slum of Cite Soleil, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) saw 216 cases of cholera at Choscal Hospital on Thursday. Five days ago, that number was only 30. Stefano Zannini, the head of mission for Medecins Sans Frontieres, said his staff was seeing seven times the cases they were seeing three days ago. ""The trend is extremely, extremely alarming,"" he said. ""We have not reached a peak yet, but it could arrive next week."" The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs put the death toll Friday at more than 800, with more than 12,000 people hospitalized. Epidemiologists predict the outbreak could last for months and say the entire nation of almost 10 million people is at risk because they have no immunity to cholera. The United Nations warned that Haiti is facing one of the most severe outbreaks of the disease in the past 100 years. It appealed to international donors for $164 million in aid and said it anticipates as many as 200,000 people to be sickened with cholera over the next six to 12 months. ""A major effort has already been made, but the sheer quantity of relief items that need to be delivered in the days and weeks ahead is going to require more logistical and financial support for the government by all humanitarian agencies and donors and very close coordination,"" said Nigel Fisher, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Haiti. ""Without this the epidemic could well outrun our efforts."" Of grave concern are cases that originated in the tent cities of Port-au-Prince, which sprang up to shelter those left homeless by the massive earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people last January. Health officials fear that infection could spread quickly in the makeshift cities' congested, unsanitary conditions and in impoverished neighborhoods where clean drinking water is at a premium. Symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even non-existent. But sometimes they can be severe: profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration, shock and death. Aid workers in Haiti are scrambling as the nation recovers not only from the earthquake, but from last week's hurricane. ""We are stretched thin,"" said Julie Schindall, a spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Oxfam. Zannini reminded the world that cholera is as much a logistical problem as a medical one. It's not just a matter of medical donations or more doctors on the ground, he said. Who will supply clean drinking water? Who will make sure there are proper bathroom facilities? Who will dispose of the waste? Or for that matter, the dead bodies? ""It's not just about donating money,"" Zannini said. ""It's about concrete actions.""","The death toll  has passed 800; more than 12,000 people have been sickened .

"A volleyed goal from substitute Tadanari Lee in the second half of extra time earned Japan a 1-0 victory over Australia and a record fourth Asian Cup Saturday. Lee hammered home a cross from Yugo Nagatomo in the 109th minute to settle the clash and leave Holgar Osieck's Australia heartbroken at Qatar's Khalifa International Stadium. The Socceroos had twice gone close with Everton's Tim Cahill having an effort cleared off the line and winger Harry Kewell firing straight at goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima when clean through on goal. But Alberto Zaccheroni's ""Blue Samurai"" weathered the storm to add to their previous triumphs in 1992, 2000 and 2004 as Lee proved their hero. ""It is a great victory. We have a really great team,"" Zaccheroni told AFP. ""They were united and won the title against such strong opponents,"" added the Italian. ""I knew he would do it. What is great about this team is that players, who started on the bench, could produce results on the pitch."" The triumph secures Japan an automatic place at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil -- a warm-up for the World Cup proper a year later. Australia had only conceded once in the competition before the final and goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, who became his country's most capped player with his 88th appearance, easily dealt with Keisuke Honda's effort in the first half. It was Osieck's side, appearing in only their second Asian Cup, who looked the more dangerous and they struck the woodwork early in the second half through Luke Wilkshire's cross that became a shot. Japan hit back when the lively Nagatomo provided a delivery for Shinji Okazaki, whose header drifted narrowly wide of the post. With 20 minutes left Kewell spurned his chance when one-on-one with Kawashima and as the game drifted towards extra-time, Japan started to take control. After 109 goalless minutes and with the match headed for penalties, Lee fired the telling blow to spark scenes of wild celebration on the Japan bench. By contrast, Australia's German coach Osieck was left to rue earlier missed chances. ""You can imagine how disappointed we are to come second because we had our opportunities. Unfortunately, we couldn't convert them,"" he told AFP.","Japan win a record fourth Asian Cup after a 1-0 win over Australia .

"Hollywood, California (CNN) -- Dr. Paul Nassif couldn't tell if his friend Charlie Sheen was drunk last Thursday when the actor made the phone call that eventually led to a hospital visit and the latest controversy about Sheen's rehab. ""I just was waking up, I was still very, very groggy and the phone rang and it was Charlie Sheen's residence,"" Nassif told CNN Tuesday. ""I spoke to Charlie for a few minutes and he said he was in a lot of pain, and remember I'm Charlie's friend. I'm not his doctor. I'm a facial plastic surgeon. ""When I spoke to Charlie it sounded like he was in a lot of pain, severe pain, so when someone's in severe pain you know it's not like I'm going to walk out my door and go see him. Plus I don't even live that close next to him,"" Nassif said. ""When I usually hear something like that -- you don't know what's going on -- so the thing you always are going to do is dial 911. ""I instructed the person I was speaking with to call 911 and then I also followed up to make sure that it was performed and kind of communicated somewhat to the paramedics,"" Nassif said. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse in his Los Angeles home. Sheen has since entered rehab, and his hit sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" has suspended production. Nassif couldn't determine whether Sheen was drunk or high. ""I couldn't tell if he was inebriated. I only spoke to him for a very brief moment because as soon as I heard him say he's in a lot of pain I wanted to get on the phone with the assistant so they can just immediately dial 911,"" Nassif said.

Nassif drove Sheen home from the hospital, but he declined to provide details of their conversation. ""There were things he said I don't feel comfortable"" disclosing, Nassif said. At another point in the interview, Nassif added: ""Obviously we all want Charlie to keep his sobriety. No one can push him into it.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Charlie Sheen plans to return to work on his hit sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" by the end of February, his representative said Thursday. CBS placed the show on ""production hiatus"" after the actor began rehab treatments in the wake of an emergency hospital visit last week. ""My understanding is that he will be back on the set at the end of February,"" Sheen representative Stan Rosenfield said. The network ordered additional episodes of the sitcom ""Rules of Engagement"" to fill any gap in their Monday night schedule, but if Sheen returns as expected they may not be needed. Sheen issued a written statement Wednesday thanking his fellow cast members, the show's crew and network executives for their support. It did not directly address the incident. ""I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people,"" Sheen said in a statement . ""Like Errol Flynn, who had to put down his sword on occasion, I just want to say, 'thank you,'"" Sheen said. Sheen was ""very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain"" last Thursday morning, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor. ""Kind of weird, the phone call I received,"" Dr. Paul Nassif told the Los Angeles Fire Department dispatcher in the recorded call, which was released by the fire department Wednesday. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse. Paramedics went to Sheen's Los Angeles home and then took him by ambulance to a hospital, where he spent several hours. Sheen's representative later blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain and ambulance ride to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He did not respond to a CNN request for comment on the 911 call Wednesday. Sheen's manager has said the actor is undergoing rehab at home, not in a residential facility. Nassif, in an interview Tuesday with HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight,"" said he couldn't tell if Sheen, who is his friend, was drunk. What he told the emergency dispatcher last week was different. ""I got him on the phone and he was very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain,"" Nassif said on the 911 call. He told the dispatcher that Sheen was saying, ""Don't call 911."" Nassif is a facial plastic surgeon and is not Sheen's medical doctor, Nassif told HLN. He later explained to HLN that he was protecting his friend by saying in Tuesday's interview that he wasn't sure Sheen was drunk. Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said. Nassif's wife, Adrienne Maloof-Nassif, appears on ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.""

The reports, which are produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. London (VBS.TV) -- At the end of 2010, VBS attended a series of violent student demonstrations in London. The first saw thousands of students storm the Conservative Party HQ and someone lob a fire extinguisher from the roof, nearly killing a police officer. Two weeks later, when the second protest rolled around, we were locked inside a 200-meter area with thousands of young protesters for 10 hours. It was a fun place to be ""kettled"" midwinter, and we watched as kids burned bus stops, held impromptu grime raves, smashed the windows of the treasury and were beaten up by police. We also noticed that a small number of protesters seemed to be assaulting each other. A week later, a journalist named Graham Johnson who specializes in gang crime confirmed what we'd suspected: that gangs had been using the protests as cover for while they made money. Various gangs had been coming from around the capital to pickpocket, mug, loot and throw the occasional lump of concrete at riot cops. We met up with a gang in South East London who, from behind facemasks, told us that they didn't care at all about politics but that they had walked away from the last protest with more than 2,000 pounds worth of goods and cash. See the rest of Teenage Riots at VBS.TV . They also predicted that as the government cuts spread their way across society, more riots would spring up, not in relatively policeable central London locations but in the estates of the most impoverished parts of the city. The protesters would not be students, either; they would be armed gang members, willing to ""wipe out a whole constabulary"" of police. Teenage Riot, which resulted from our time at the protests, is a five-part film looking at the riots, their significance and the strange combination of students, schoolkids, gangs, anarchists and police that made up the clashes that would define the most violent period of political upheaval in this country since the '80s.","VBS goes inside 2010's student protests in London .

"Washington (CNN) -- Every one of the 3,000 students at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, has met with a guidance counselor and come up with individual goals that include plans for graduating high school and beyond. ""I'm surprised by how invested the students have gotten in creating the goals for themselves,"" said guidance counselor Elisabeth Neace. While students at T.C. Williams have thought about their future, many high school students have not, and leave high school unprepared for adult life. That transition from secondary school to employability is the focus of a new report released by the Harvard Graduate School of Education that advocates a shift in the way the United States looks at college degrees. ""It is long past time that we broaden the range of high-quality pathways that we offer to our young people, beginning in high school,"" according to the Pathways to Prosperity report. It says that in the United States, too much emphasis is placed on attending and graduating from a four-year college as the only path for success. While 47 million new jobs are projected to be created in the United States by 2018, only a third of those will require a bachelor's degree or higher, according to the report. Thirty percent of those new jobs will require an associate's degree or a post-secondary occupational certificate. ""In our view, the U.S. system would be greatly strengthened if the pathways to all major occupations were clearly delineated from the beginning of high school,"" the report says. This would let students and their parents clearly see what courses of study and other experiences would ""best position them to gain access to that field,"" the report adds. Also, the report advocates a larger role for future employers by linking classroom learning to actual jobs through paid internships, and providing more access to jobs related to the students' field of study while they are still in school. The report recommends that future employers work with educators to design programs of study for students. ""Our goal should be that beginning no later than middle school, all students should have access to this system of employer involvement and assistance,"" according to the report. ""Unless we are willing to provide more flexibility and choice in the last two years of high school, and more opportunities for students to pursue program options that link work and learning, we will continue to lose far too many young people along the path to graduation,"" says Robert Schwartz, who heads the Pathways to Prosperity Project at Harvard. Traditionally, U.S. students receive career advice from middle and high school guidance counselors, but the report points out that under the current system, the average ratio of students to counselors is 500 to 1. The counselors at T. C. Williams feel extremely lucky to have a ratio of 151 students to one guidance counselor. The high school restructured its administration for the 2010-2011 school year and added an additional five counselors to its staff of twelve. ""The lower ratio means the counselors are having access to students in ways we haven't been able to before,"" according to Greg Forbes, the director of secondary school counseling there. The additional staff allows them to have more interaction with the students. ""It's a different type of feel when you are talking about customizing and personalizing education for each and every child,"" said Forbes.","A new report calls for a shift in the way the U.S. looks at college degrees .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's big spending on Europe's transfer deadline day has been criticized by one of the club's English rivals, who questioned how the Premier League champions can meet UEFA's new financial fair-play rules. The London team announced a loss of $113 million on Monday for the year ended June 30, 2010 -- but then smashed the British transfer record with a reported $80 million acquisition of Spain striker Fernando Torres, and also laid out $34 million for Brazil defender David Luiz. The Torres deal allowed his former club Liverpool to spend $55 million on Newcastle's relatively unproven England striker Andy Carroll, who is injured, and $36 million on Uruguay forward Luis Suarez. However, European football's governing body UEFA will take sanctions against clubs who cannot balance their books by the end of the 2012 reporting period. The best and worst deals of a dramatic deadline day . Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal were again quiet in the January transfer window, and manager Arsene Wenger questioned the tactics of the Blues' billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich. ""Chelsea supported UEFA's financial fair-play proposals but in the morning they announced a £70 million loss and in the afternoon they buy £75 million worth of players. Where's the logic in that?"" he told reporters after Tuesday's 2-1 Premier League win over Everton. ""It's hard to guess. Officially they vote for financial fair play, but they can explain why they have done this much better than I can. Abramovich can tell you why, but that's how you can read it from the outside. ""If you don't invest for a while, it looks as if you're not as involved in it anymore, that he doesn't like it as much. But £75 million means more will come. ""Abramovich was a bit in no-man's land where nobody could guess if he wanted to still invest or not. He has been like that for a long time, but that has changed. He has decided to put big money in again and that tells you in the summer more will come. He is back to full investment."" Adriano Galliani, vice-president of Italian club AC Milan, also criticized the level of spending in England -- which reached a record $363 million. ""Everyone's talking about balancing the books but then they spend like crazy people,"" he told reporters. ""Chelsea strengthened in an amazing way, spending 80 million euros. I just don't know where financial sense will end up."" Chelsea sign Torres and Luiz in frantic end to deadline day . Chelsea dressed up the club's financial results by saying they were ""cash positive"" with a net inflow of £3.8 million compared to an outflow of £16.9 million in 2008-09. ""The club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of UEFA 'financial fair play' initiatives which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013,"" chief executive Ron Gourlay told the Chelsea website. UEFA released a statement saying that clubs ""are increasingly aware of the nature of the financial fair-play rules, which aim to encourage clubs to balance their incomes and expenses over a period of time covering four to six transfer windows."" It refused to comment on individual clubs, but said the rules did not stop them from spending money on transfers as such -- the emphasis is on balancing books at the end of the season. ""There is no doubt that transfers made now will impact on the break-even results of the financial years ending 2012 and 2013 -- the first financial years to be assessed under the break-even rule,"" UEFA said. ""The clubs know the rules and also know that UEFA is fully committed to implementing them with rigor. As from this summer, all payments due on transfers and to employees will be assessed by the Club Financial Control Panel as part of the 'enhanced overdue payables' rule.""","Arsenal manager unhappy with Chelsea's $114 million outlay on two players .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A 23-year-old British student has designed a ""super-green superyacht"" built using only sustainable materials and which produces virtually no carbon emissions. 600 square meters of solar panels and three giant ""wings"" mean  ""Soliloquy"" can run on wind energy or solar power. ""Soliloquy's"" unique eco-luxury design allows the boat to run on two different sources of sustainable energy by incorporating 600 square meters of solar panels on the exterior of the boat and giant rigid ""wings"" that function like sails. Although the 58-meter boat has yet to be built, it would be able to run either on wind energy via the wings (known as ""rigid-wing solarsails""), solar power supplied by the panels or a combination of the two. An equivalent-sized superyacht burns anywhere between 250 and 600 liters of marine diesel per hour, depending on speed and fuel efficiency, and emits three times that in CO2 emissions, according to British yachting carbon offset company, Yacht Carbon Offset. Some of the biggest SUVs on the road burn around 20 liters of fuel per hour. Both the panels and solarsails -- developed by Australian company Solar Sailor -- on the vessel can fold up or completely stretch out depending on which energy source is in use, changing the yacht's shape. ""I wanted to prove that eco-luxury no longer has to be an oxymoron and doesn't have to make a yacht more expensive,"" designer Alastair Callender, a life-long sailing fanatic, told CNN.   See more images of super-yacht Soliloquy » . ""My generation is passionate about the planet and we've got to do all we can so that the earth can sustain us,"" he added. ""At the same time, however, I am also passionate about superyachts."" Soliloquy is projected to cost approximately $60 to $65 million to build -- similar in cost to conventional superyachts of its size. Callender is currently in talks with potential owners to have the vessel built. The wider superyacht community is enthused about the potential of his design and he has also been invited to speak about his ever-evolving, eco-vessel in Abu Dhabi and Monaco. Callender was originally inspired by famed architect David Fishers' design for a ""constantly moving"" tower in Dubai. ""That's how the idea of an ever-evolving superyacht started -- with the three wings that can independently rotate through 360 degrees,"" Callender explained. Do you like the look of Soliloquy? Tell us in the Sound Off box below . Callender designed ""Soliloquy"" during his final year studying at Coventry University in England. He approached Solar Sailor, an Australian technology company for technical validation of his design. He also asked a local engineering company, Visioneering, to help construct an intricately detailed scale model. At first, some at Visioneering were taken aback by Callender's young age. ""But the idea was innovative and sometimes younger people can bring on board really fresh, new ideas,"" said Adrian Coppin of Visioneering. ""He also has a lot of experience in the yachting industry."" Callender says his passion comes from a childhood spent in Portsmouth, England: ""I grew up near a harbor, 200 meters away from my sailing club."" After school, Callender went to Greece for six months to teach sailing. He then worked with some of the big yacht design companies, including that of his mentor, Andrew Winch. He now feels confident that with a good business plan, his project will become reality. ""There are hundreds of extremely rich families who invest in green technology and until now have not wanted to buy yachts because they produce too many carbon emissions,"" he said. ""But with a yacht like Soliloquy, I think they may consider it.""","A 23-year-old British student has designed a super-green superyacht .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan moved into third place in Italy's Serie A after inflicting yet more misery on bottom-placed Bari with a 3-0 win. Late goals from Houssine Kharja, Giampaolo Pazzini and Wesley Sneijder sealed three points for the Nerazzurri, who are now seven points behind city rivals and league leaders AC Milan with a game in hand. It was their fifth win in the last six games since former AC Milan coach Leonardo took over from Rafael Benitez. The only stain on a good night for Inter was a punch thrown by Romanian defender Christian Chivu at opponent Marco Rossi. The officials missed the incident but Chivu may be retrospectively punished. A poor playing surface gave rise to a scrappy first half of few chances. Bari did threaten through Sergio Almiron and Simone Bentivoglio before Inter's Brazilian defender Maicon flashed a shot wide of the post for the defending champions. The home side again went close in the early stages of the second half when Alessandro Parisi forced Julio Cesar into a save. But with 20 minutes to go Inter made the breakthrough as Kharja, from Morocco, swapped passes with Samuel Eto'o before firing low into the net. With Bari desperately seeking an equalizer Inter added two more goals late on. First Pazzini scored his third goal in two games since his $16m move from Sampdoria -- his shot squirmed under Bari goalkeeper Jean Francois Gillet in injury time. Then Dutch international Sneijder rounded off the scoring, finishing from close range after Kharja's lay-off.","Inter Milan win 3-0 away at Bari to move second in Serie A .

"Editor's note: Steve Politi is a sports columnist for The Star-Ledger in Newark, New Jersey, who has covered Bob Hurley Sr.'s career. Bob Hurley Sr. is about to hit a milestone few basketball coaches on any level have reached: 1,000 victories. He has won them the hard way at St. Anthony High in Jersey City, New Jersey, sweeping the hardwood floor before home games and riding yellow buses to cramped gymnasiums up and down the East Coast. The victories helped make him just the third boys high school coach to earn enshrinement in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. They earned him the respect of some of the highest-profile coaches in the sport, including Mike Krzyzewski at Duke. But his true legacy is much deeper than the lights on the scoreboard. Hurley said he would trade in those wins -- every last one of them -- for a chance to help more inner-city kids. ""You know what? I would give them up for one more chance with some of the kids I didn't reach over the years,"" Hurley said. ""If I could have a second chance with some of those, it would be worth all the adulation."" Hurley doesn't coach for the attention. If he wanted that, he long ago would have left St. Anthony, a tiny Catholic school a few blocks from the Holland Tunnel, for the arenas and riches of the college game. He chose to stay in Jersey City, becoming one of the coaching legends in the high school game. Hurley, whose current team is ranked second in the country in an ESPN poll, will likely win his 1,000th game late next week. No one is sure exactly how many losses that includes -- 109 or 110 is the best guess -- but they rarely happen more than once or twice a season. Still, even with 25 state parochial titles, the victories are a small part of what he has accomplished. Hurley, 63, has been a father figure for hundreds of inner-city teenagers over the past four decades. He has placed nearly all of them in four-year colleges, most on scholarships. Some are doctors and businessmen now. Others are lawyers and police captains. One owns a popular restaurant in Jersey City and once held a seat on the city's board of education. Terry Dehere, who went on to play at Seton Hall and in the NBA, could have moved on from his roots. Instead, he moved back to Jersey City, twice renovating his boyhood playground, restoring an abandoned building for low-income housing and hands out 500 turkeys annually each Thanksgiving. ""(Hurley) had a direct effect on a lot of young men's lives growing up in Jersey City,"" Dehere said. ""To have a coach who was dedicated and a taskmaster helped a lot of kids -- and I'm a living testament to it."" Dehere played for Hurley in the late '80s. Two decades later, Mike Rosario was the star of the team, a hot-tempered kid who used basketball as a refuge from the life in a housing project. ""He started disciplining me like I was one of his sons,"" Rosario said. ""It was to the point where I was like, 'Wow, I had never been pushed like this in my life.' I learned how to be a man and not a boy."" Rosario now plays college ball at the University of Florida. Coaching at a place like St. Anthony isn't always a glamorous life, but Hurley has always recognized its importance in the city where he grew up. The school, with just 250 students, boasts a 100% college acceptance rate over the past 18 years, according to its Web site. Hurley has helped keep the doors open through his fundraising efforts, never making more than a $6,500 stipend for coaching. He worked as a probation officer and then a parks department official before retiring from his day jobs to focus on his team and his grandchildren. His first victory came on December 8, 1972. It was an impressive debut, a 64-43 win over a team whose coach was ejected in frustration, but there were few signs of a dynasty in the making. ""I remember that like it was yesterday,"" Hurley said. ""You think, 'Wow. It would be nice to do that again.' "" St. Anthony kept winning and winning, and producing college-ready players along the way. That attracted attention from the next level. Finally, in the spring of 1985, he received a phone call from then Xavier coach Pete Gillen with a simple message. ""It's time."" He accepted an offer to become Gillen's top assistant. But then he arrived home to find his three children waiting. Bobby, his oldest son, had written a list of reasons why he had to stay at St. Anthony that left the old man in tears. ""Who's going to be my coach? You're going to be on the road all the time. Are you ever going to see me play?"" So Hurley stayed put. His team with his son at point guard is regarded as one of the best in state history, and when he graduated from St. Anthony, Bobby Hurley helped turn another coach into a legend, too. Krzyzewski has won four national championships at Duke, including two when Bobby Hurley was his point guard. He was the presenter on August 13 when Hurley Sr. was inducted into the Hall of Fame, standing proudly over his shoulder as the high school lifer joined the most exclusive club. ""Bob has a passion to help young men get the opportunities they would never have gotten unless he and basketball entered their lives,"" Krzyzewski said. ""He should be in the Hall of Fame not for the number of wins, but for the number of lives he's changed."" His induction was not just a victory for Hurley. It was a validation for thousands of high school coaches across the country. Few will ever get the same recognition. Hurley has been the subject of a best-selling book, ""The Miracle of St. Anthony,"" and an award-winning documentary, ""The Street Stops Here."" But in a way, when he stood with NBA stars such as Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone at the induction ceremony, he stood for all the coaches who work at the grassroots level of the sport. The men and women who not only shape the lives of young people, but sweep the floors before games. ""What we see is the finished product,"" Malone said before the induction ceremony. ""But somewhere along the line, somebody looked at every one of us and said, 'I think I'll give that young man a chance.' Our high school coaches don't get nearly enough credit.""","Bob Hurley Sr. coaches high school basketball in Jersey City, New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid will face arch-rivals Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Cup after both teams won the second legs of their semifinals on Wednesday. Barcelona progressed first with a 3-0 win at struggling Almeria which sealed an 8-0 aggregate victory to surpass Athletic Bilbao's 34 final appearances. Real then knocked out defending champions Sevilla with a 2-0 home win to extend their record to 37 finals, having taken a 1-0 advantage into the match. Coach Jose Mourinho has the chance to end Real's 17-year trophy drought in the Copa del Rey as Madrid face Barca twice in the space of a week in April. The final on April 20 comes just three days after the second scheduled La Liga ""Clasico"" between the two teams this season at the Santiago Bernabeu. Vote for the best clubs in the world in new CNN poll . Real went down 5-0 in the first meeting at the Camp Nou on November 29, and trail Barcelona by seven points in the league after Sunday's defeat by Osasuna. But Mourinho's men bounced back to beat 10-man Sevilla with second-half goals from Mesut Ozil and new signing Emmanuel Adebayor. Real winger Angel Di Maria hit the post in the fifth minute, but Ozil finally broke the deadlock with eight to play as he rounded goalkeeper Jari Varas after a defense-splitting pass from fellow Germany midfielder Sami Khedira. Sevilla had defender Sergio Sanchez sent off soon after for his second booking after a challenge on substitute Adebayor, who marked his home debut with a goal in the fourth minute of time added on. 'Cocky' Ronaldo ridiculed by 'the Rifle' The Togo international, signed on loan until the end of this season from English club Manchester City, controlled a cross from fellow replacement Lassana Diarra on his chest and smashed a volley into the net. While Real can boast 17 cup wins and 19 runner-up finishes, Barcelona will be seeking to extend the Catalan club's record of 25 triumphs, with the last coming in 2009 against Bilbao. With key players such as Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Xavi, Gerard Pique and Pedro Rodriguez all rested at Almeria, Barca still cruised with goals from Adriano, Thiago Alcantara and Ibrahim Afellay. Brazilian defender Adriano scored his first goal for the club in the 34th minute after cutting in from the left flank to slot home, while 10 minutes after halftime 19-year-old Thiago headed in a cross from the right by Dani Alves. Dutch midfielder Ifellay then scored his first goal since joining from PSV Eindhoven at the start of last month in the 65th minute to kill off Almeria, who reached the last four for the first time.","Barcelona reach Copa del Rey final for the 35th time after beating Almeria 3-0 .

"Houston, Texas (CNN)  -- The doctor currently in charge of Gabrielle Giffords' neurological recovery, the man who's had his very hands in Giffords' brain, was once mistaken for a kung fu expert. It was 1972, and the second-graders at Ed Smith Elementary School in Syracuse, New York, didn't quite know what to make of Dong Kim, the boy who'd just arrived from Korea. ""There were probably not that many Asian people there at that time, so a lot of the kids just assumed I knew kung fu,"" Kim remembered, laughing. ""I got some notoriety out of that. I knew nothing about kung fu, but I could kind of fake it and impress people, or at least impress other 7-year olds."" That boy grew up to be chairman of the director of the Mischer Neuroscience Institute at Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center. Giffords came under his care last week when she was transferred to Texas from the University Medical Center in Arizona. On Monday, Kim removed a drain from Giffords' brain, which had been placed there to remove excess fluid. Kim, whose father was studying library science at Syracuse University, recalls his early days in the United States sitting in a classroom not understanding anything ""a little anxiety-provoking, but I felt pretty comfortable."" He enjoyed math from the beginning, since the numbers made sense, and within the year, he learned English. ""I do think that the immigrant experience is quite a strong one,"" he said. ""I remember growing up feeling strongly that my parents had come here for me and my sister. I remember them commenting over and over again what a great country this was and how we're lucky to be here. I think that kind of instills in you that you're getting this real opportunity and you should try to take advantage of it."" Kim's family later moved to Southern California, and he received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University. Medicine was not his first love. ""At 18 or 19, I was trying to write the great American novel, but I would stare at the page for an hour and half and get two sentences out, so that's not good,"" he said, laughing. ""What I wrote didn't read well, even to me."" By his junior year at Stanford, Kim had taken an interest in medicine, and he received his medical degree from the University of California-San Francisco. Within a few years of finishing his residency, he arrived at one of his chosen fields of research, the genetics of brain aneurysms, a condition in which a blood vessel bulges out and can later rupture and bleed, causing a stroke. His interest lay partly in his own family history. Three of his four grandparents died of brain hemorrhages, or bleeding in the brain, as did his 37-year-old uncle, a surgeon who Kim says was kidnapped by the North Koreans. Kim and his team discovered several genes related to aneurysms. He had his parents tested, and both were negative. Another area of research involves using stem cells from a patient's skin to treat spinal cord injuries. The treatments they developed have allowed paralyzed rats to walk again, and they hope to begin studies in humans in the next two to three years. Kim says his favorite part of his work is when a patient returns to his office after undergoing a traumatic illness, such as a brain injury, stroke or tumor. ""When I first meet a new patient with a new problem, it's tough for everybody. They're upset. I'm worried about them. I feel for what they're going through, and it's the best thing to get them through it,"" he says. The hardest part of his job is when things don't go so well. Sometimes, for example, he has a patient with cancer, and there are few treatments. Or ""even worse,"" he said, is when a patient has a surgical complication. ""No matter who you are, a few times a year, that happens, and the thought that you did something, even though you were trying to help them, and things didn't go well, is very, very difficult,"" he says. ""But nobody's perfect, and you can't have a 100% success rate."" As for his most famous patient, Kim has very little to say aside from a few comments at news conferences. At a recent interview with CNN, a public relations representative from his hospital interrupted whenever a question was asked about Giffords. When asked whether he couldn't speak because the hospital had limited him or because Giffords' family had asked him not to, he laughed. ""I don't know if I can comment on not commenting,"" he said. ""It would be dishonest if I said (treating Giffords) wasn't different, because there's all this scrutiny. Everybody's calling,"" he added. ""Certainly, that heightens the situation."" But he knows that doing anything different for her, breaking with regular protocol, would be a mistake. ""I think the best way to handle it is in the mechanics of care of the patient is to do everything the same,"" he said. ""I think you can potentially get into trouble when you try to start doing things differently or making exceptions.""","Dr. Dong Kim in charge of Gabrielle Giffords' neurological recovery .

"(CNN) -- Danish golfer Thomas Bjorn made himself the player to beat at the Qatar Masters with a late surge on Saturday, claiming a one-shot lead going into the final round of the European Tour tournament. The 39-year-old birdied four of the last five holes on Saturday to card a six-under-par 66 which moved him up to 11-under 205, leapfrogging overnight leader Markus Brier of Austria. European Ryder Cup vice-captain Bjorn, last a winner at the 2010 Estoril Open in Portugal, is aiming for his 11th tour title having followed up Friday's round of 65 with another strong showing. ""When you finish a round with four birdies in the last five, you have to walk off very happy,"" Bjorn told the European Tour website. ""I played fantastic yesterday to shoot that 65 and felt comfortable this morning, and felt good with the way my golf is. ""I'm feeling quite comfortable on the golf course considering it's been a while since I've been in that kind of situation, so I'm pleased with the way the day panned out."" Brier, ranked 478th in the world, could not improve on Friday's second-round 66 as he finished on 69 after his second bogey of the round at the final hole -- but is still in second place with 18 to play on Sunday. The 42-year-old, who was without a single top-20 finish on the European Tour last year and is playing only by virtue of a sponsor's invitation, is confident he can reignite his career with success in the Middle East. ""Obviously when you bogey the last, it's never nice. But I just had a really bad shot -- it happens, and the rest was good,"" said Brier, who birdied the fourth and sixth before his first slip at the ninth. ""I made a few crunch putts at the end. I got a bit lazy with my shots but I managed to keep my score good, and just one shot back is nothing."" Defending champion Robert Karlsson is also still in touch with the leaders as he seeks to become the first player to win back-to-back titles in the event. The Swede was just three strokes behind Bjorn in third spot after carding five birdies in his last seven holes for a 69 which put him on 208. Thomas Aiken of South Africa also shot 69 to finish the day in fourth place on seven under, while Spain's Alvaro Quiros (66) and England's Richard Finch (71) tied for fifth on six under. British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen (69) was joined on five under by Spain's Rafael Caberra (66) and Scotland's Paul Lawrie (71) and Stephen O'Hara (69). But a disappointing round of 75 left South Africa's first-round leader and 2007 champion Retief Goosen tied for 28th place on 215 alongside world No. 2 Martin Kaymer and Spain's Sergio Garcia (69). Kaymer could replace Lee Westwood at the top of the rankings with a first or second-place finish after the Englishman missed the weekend cut, but was 10 shots off the pace despite his best round of the week. The German made up for a ninth-hole bogey with five subsequent birdies -- including one at the last -- but his opening 77 and Friday's 70 mean he has a mountain to climb. Meanwhile, Tommy Gainey continued to defy expectations by leading at the halfway stage of the PGA Tour's weather-affected Phoenix Open in Arizona.

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- A protest erupted Saturday in a village in northern Indian-administered Kashmir after the killing of a man by the Indian army late Friday or early Saturday. The Indian army said the man was shot after he walked into an ambush it laid after getting specific information about movement of militants in the area. But the family of the victim alleged he had been taken out of his home by the soldiers and his body was found early Saturday. Mohammad Shafi Rather, district magistrate in the Kupwara district, where the death occurred, told CNN that an investigation has been ordered into the killing of the man, identified as Manzoor Ahmad Magray, 24. A case has also been registered against the army unit, he said. ""The enquiry would be conducted by the additional district magistrate Kupwara and the probe report would be submitted within a month,"" Rather said. As the news of the killing spread in the village of Chogul, hundreds of residents assembled there and staged a protest. Shouting pro-freedom slogans, the villagers carried the man's body to a highway and laid it there, blocking traffic. After the district magistrate provided assurances of an investigation, the villagers took the body to a graveyard for burial. The Indian army issued a statement Saturday morning regretting the man's death, but maintaining that ""the troops had adhered to standard operating procedure (SOP) in the incident."" The army's statement said Magray had walked into the ambush along with another individual. After being challenged to surrender, the two started running away, at which point the troops opened fire. ""We deeply and sincerely express our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family on this incident,"" said Lt. Col. J.S. Brar, a Srinagar-based defense spokesman. A long summer of pro-independence unrest was sparked in Indian administered Kashmir last year by the killing of an 18-year-old boy in police action in the capital, Srinagar.","The Indian army says the man ran after being challenged .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles district attorney will decide if Lindsay Lohan will be charged with stealing a necklace from a jewelry store last week, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor said. ""They presented the evidence about mid-day,"" spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said Wednesday afternoon. ""We have the case under review. No decision will be made today. I can't say when it might be made."" A ""one of a kind necklace"" reported stolen last week was given to Los Angeles police just before detectives were to search for it in Lohan's Venice, California, home, Los Angeles police said earlier Wednesday. The necklace, valued at $2,500, was taken from a jewelry store in the Venice area, a statement from the Los Angeles Police Department said. ""As part of the grand theft investigation, detectives with the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific area obtained a search warrant on February 1, 2011, for actress Lindsay Lohan's Venice residence, to search for the necklace,"" the statement said. Her lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holly, did not offer a response to the police or the prosecutor's statements. Lohan, 24, is currently on supervised probation for a drunk driving conviction. The judge overseeing her case told her in October that he would send her to jail for 180 days if she violated her probation rules before her next court appearance set for February 25. She left the Betty Ford clinic a month ago after three months in a drug rehabilitation program. The rehab stint convinced the judge not to send Lohan to jail for failing a drug test.

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Arizona shooting victim James Eric Fuller sent his apologies Monday for telling a Tea Party leader, ""you are dead."" Dorothy DeRuyter, a companion of Fuller's, provided CNN with a statement. ""I would like to tender my sincerest apologies to Mr. (Trent) Humphries for my misplaced outrage on Saturday at the St. Odelia's town meeting,"" Fuller said in the statement. ""It was not in the spirit of our allegiance and warm feelings to each other as citizens of our great country."" Fuller, 63, was involuntarily committed to a county mental health facility after he photographed Tucson Tea Party founder Humphries and said, ""You are dead"" when Humphries began speaking at the event. Fuller ""is apologetic and very sad"" about his outburst, DeRuyter said. ""He wishes he could go back and do things differently,"" she said. Humphries said Fuller's comment came when the town hall discussion turned to gun control. ""I was asked to give my thoughts on gun control laws and perhaps the passage of new laws,"" Humphries said of the incident. ""I said something to the effect that although gun rights and laws are not necessarily the primary focus of the Tucson Tea Party, our community needs to be given the opportunity to allow some time to pass and people to heal before we start this type of political dialogue."" Fuller, one of 13 people wounded in the January 8 shooting that left six people dead and Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in critical condition, is a disabled veteran and former volunteer for Giffords' campaign. Giffords is still hospitalized, but her condition has been improved to serious. Fuller, who was shot in the knee, had been very vocal since the incident, blaming rhetoric from the right for the shooting. Jared Loughner, 22, has been charged in the shooting, but no evidence has been found that could link a motive to incendiary rhetoric.

"(CNN) -- Former Haitian first lady Mirlande Manigat will face popular musician Michel Martelly in the second round of presidential elections in Haiti, the electoral commission announced Thursday. The government-backed candidate, Jude Celestin, was eliminated from the race. The announcement followed pressure from the United States and others on President Rene Preval to honor recommendations from the Organization of American States regarding the runoff election. In early December, the electoral council announced that Manigat had won but lacked the majority of votes needed for an outright victory. Initial results put her in a runoff with Celestin, a protege of the president. The third-place candidate, Martelly, claimed he had won more votes than Celestin and a review of results by an Organization of American States team supported that contention. That review suggested that Martelly earned a spot in the runoff. When the initial results were announced, Haitians responded by charging fraud and burning cars, tires and Celestin's campaign headquarters in Port-au-Prince. With Thursday's decision, the council accepted the findings of the review. The vote is set for March 20. Final results will not be known until April 16, officials say. U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth Merten told reporters in Washington that Thursday was ""a good day in Haiti."" Merten called for all of Haiti's politicians and people to remain ""calm and peaceful"" in the run-up to the second round of voting. The attempts to resolve the political turmoil come as the toll in the nation's cholera outbreak surged past 4,000, the public health ministry said. Nearly 216,000 people have been sickened and 4,131 had died as of January 28, according to the latest report posted by the ministry. Struck by a massive earthquake a year ago, Haiti has been struggling to recover. Its troubles were compounded first by cholera and then by the controversy surrounding the November 28 presidential election. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.S. ambassador calls it a ""good day"" for Haiti .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and his administration ""strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that's taken place on the streets of Cairo today"" and want it to end quickly, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Wednesday. Supporters of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak attacked anti-government demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square, and the ensuing violence killed three people and injured more than 600, according to Egypt's health minister. ""It is our hope that what we saw today we won't see tomorrow or Friday or into the weekend,"" Gibbs told reporters. ""Obviously ... this is not all going to be wrapped up in a matter of hours. It's going to take some time."" Gibbs reiterated the Obama administration's opposition to any violence in the Egypt demonstrations, either by Egyptian security forces, protesters or criminal elements. He added that if the Egyptian government is instigating any of the violence, ""it should stop immediately."" At the State Department, spokesman P.J. Crowley called the attacks by what he described as ""thugs"" a clear attempt to intimidate the anti-government protesters, who were demonstrating for a ninth straight day. The United States doesn't know the identity of the ""thugs,"" Crowley said, adding that others have identified them as ""supporters of the government."" In an operation that started Monday, more than 1,900 U.S. citizens and their family members have been evacuated from Egypt, Crowley said, adding that further evacuations would take place Thursday. The attacks came the day after Mubarak announced he would not seek re-election as part of a series of political reforms. Opposition activists and protesters, however, said Mubarak must step down immediately with a caretaker unity government running the country until elections for president and a new parliament can take place. It was unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere. Other Cairo neighborhoods were calm, and contesting rallies in Egypt's second largest city, Alexandria, were largely peaceful. Gibbs said the time for a political transition in Egypt ""is now"" because the Egyptian people ""need to see change,"" and a ""meaningful transition must include opposition voices and parties being involved in this process as we move toward free and fair elections."" At the same time, Gibbs noted that events in Egypt ""have moved enormously quickly in a very volatile region of the world,"" adding: ""What we're watching is history being made."" High-level contacts between the U.S. and Egyptian governments continued Wednesday, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton talking to newly appointed Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman, Crowley said. And Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke by phone with Egypt's defense minister on Wednesday, their third conversation in recent days. Those contacts followed separate meetings on Monday between former U.S. ambassador to Egypt Frank Wisner, who traveled to Cairo to deliver a message on behalf of Obama, with Mubarak and Suleiman, according to Crowley. A senior State Department official said on condition of not being identified that Mubarak has ""a narrow amount of time"" to make changes or take steps, with more demonstrations planned for Friday. However, the official said ""there is a sentiment in the (Egyptian) government they can outlive the protesters."" ""This is a false assumption,"" the official said. ""They are not going away."" Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official who spoke on condition of not being identified expressed concern that Mubarak loyalists might have unleashed pro-Mubarak forces to intimidate protesters. The Obama administration believes Mubarak's inner circle is debating whether Mubarak needs to do more to meet protester demands, according to the senior U.S. official. However, an Egyptian government official said on condition of not being identified that his government has a ""serious problem"" with how the Obama administration has been ""spinning"" the events to give the impression that Mubarak's statement Tuesday night resulted from pressure from Obama. ""This is Mubarak's decision,"" the Egyptian official said. ""Clearly, yes, he has been listening to the messages coming from the administration ... but at the end of the day, this is a decision he had come to on his own in the interests of Egypt, first and foremost, and as he said, as a result of listening very carefully to the demands of the Egyptian people."" The Egyptian official said his government has rejected calls by Obama and other world leaders to begin the transition now. ""This is an Egyptian process,"" the official said. ""What President Mubarak said is that his primary responsibility is to ensure security and order so as to ensure a peaceful transfer of power so that the Egyptian people may decide their next leader in the upcoming presidential elections."" The official noted that the steps announced by Mubarak included the resignation of the government, formation of a new cabinet, appointment of Suleiman as vice president, announcing he will not run again, planned changes to the constitution, opening a dialogue with the opposition and various issues involving last year's parliamentary elections. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Elise Labott, Chris Lawrence and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","U.S. officials stop short of blaming Egyptian government for attacks on protesters .

"(CNN) -- Professional kiteboarder Sean Reyngoudt is unique -- and it is not just the dangerous stunts he performs that set him apart. ""I'll be out there doing all my tricks and everything -- having a good time and then I come in to the beach and people realize that I'm missing my leg and they are totally shocked by it,"" says Reyngoudt. Reyngoudt, 27, is an amputee. About eight years ago, he fell off a forklift and the accident caused him to lose his left leg just below the knee. Before the accident, Reyngoudt had played football, baseball, soccer and ran track for his high school team. His mother Esthi Reyngoudt was devastated when she saw her son after the surgery. ""I just saw my kid without a leg and thought that he would sit around on the couch and he wouldn't be able to do anything anymore,"" she said. That thought did not last long, since her son was back in the water swimming before he was even fitted for his prosthesis. ""When I first got my prosthesis, that made a huge difference,"" says Reyngoudt, ""I was running out of their office."" He hasn't stopped running since. It was soon after when Reyngoudt took up extreme sports like kiteboarding and wakeboarding. His dedication and perseverance had Reyngoudt exceeding all expectation and his talent landed him a spot on the Best Kiteboarding Team. He now competes solo. Fellow professional kiteboarder Matt Sexton agrees that it is Reyngoudt's abilities and not his unique status as the only professional amputee that earns him respect. ""He's beaten us a lot of times in races and freestyle stuff,"" says Sexton. ""It's motivating for us as much as it is for people sharing the same problems as his."" Reyngoudt says he doesn't view his amputation as a problem. He says he looks at it as more of a challenge -- one that he appears to have overcome. ""We actually have a poster of Sean up in the shop, riding,"" says Mike Walsh, owner of Otherside Boardsports a sponsor of Reyngoudt. ""Unless you look close, it's just a sick picture of a kiteboarder doing a nice trick."" Walsh didn't look close when he first met Reyngoudt. He says Reyngoudt must have been wearing long pants when he first started coming into his shop because it took months until Walsh noticed his leg. It was Reyngoudt's talent that Walsh first noticed. ""It is a disability, but I don't think he's by any means disabled."" ""I don't have a disabled parking sticker on my car, I enjoy walking far away from the store,"" Reyngoudt says. ""It doesn't bother me."" Referring to him as disabled doesn't bother him either, says Reyngoudt. ""I think what every amputee should do is to just take full advantage of what you have. And live life every day as you can and enjoy it."" Reyngoudt and his friends enjoy spending every minute they can out on the water where he isn't treated any different. Walsh says, ""It just takes an extra minute to get ready, but other than that, he's just one of the boys."" Getting treated like and acting like one of the boys is exactly what his mother hoped for after her son's accident. Offering advice to other families of amputees, Esthi Reyngoudt says, ""You got to encourage them to get up every day and do what they did before and not give up. Because it's not the end of the world. It's your attitude that keeps you going."" It's Reyngoudt's attitude that has put him in the unique position of being the only professional kiteboarder that happens to be an amputee. ""He's an excellent ambassador for the sport,"" and that has nothing to do with his leg, says Walsh, and everything to do with ""his personality, his perseverance, his commitment, his loyalty.""","Sean Reyngoudt is a professional kiteboarder, which includes dangerous stunts .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters battled bushfires in and around Perth in Western Australia on Monday, emergency officials said. The raging flames have destroyed at least 59 homes, Sally Bowery with CNN affiliate Seven Network reported, citing fire authorities. Western Australia's premier, Colin Barnett, said that the severity of the fire damage was bad enough that he has declared a natural disaster in the Perth's hills region. The declaration means residents can qualify for emergency accommodation, food, essential clothing and other personal items, temporary living expenses, housing repairs and replacement of household furniture. Fire and Emergency Services Authority (FESA) officials declared a total fire ban for ""Perth, Perth hills and surrounding areas, Mandurah, inland parts of the Central Wheatbelt and the Central West."" The flames are being fanned by 75 kph (47 mph) winds. An initial investigation indicates the fire was accidentally started from sparks caused by a person using an angle grinder.","Investigators believe the fire was accidentally started .

"(Oprah.com) -- At the small worktable in Anna Rabinowicz's sunny Manhattan office, smooth slices of agate -- some as small as coins, others as big as dinner plates, in swirling shades of sapphire, rust, and olive -- mingle with wrist-thick hunks of faceted crystal, three knobby yellow gourds, and a dried version of Anna's latest muse. ""A neat thing about sea fans,"" says Anna, 39, who is wearing silver sea-fan-shaped earrings, ""is how they move."" She imitates the meshlike creature's undulations with her hand. ""They're at the whim of the current; they get their nutrients from whatever happens to pass through."" She lifts the stainless steel colander/fruit bowl she recently designed based on her sea fan research, its sides veined with silver tendrils. If a sea fan mated with a Rolex, this would be the result. I'm spending today dipping a toe into the ocean of Anna's creative output -- and the colander is just one of the creatures in a vast and lively sea. The woman draws, sews, sculpts, and dreams things up as naturally as the rest of us breathe. For her company, RabLabs, she designs coasters, clocks, and picture frames from those pieces of agate, along with handblown-glass napkin rings, amethyst bottle stoppers, and lacquered wooden boxes -- and at home, her creative juices just keep on flowing. Over eight hours with Anna, I'll discover that her default thought process works like this: . That [sea fan, kangaroo, hunk of quartz, sequined fabric] is fascinating. I must learn all about it and then make something! Next comes studying, sketching, model-making, and finally, the finished product -- which might be anything from a letter opener to a medical device to a fetching new cape. Oprah.com: How one woman was saved by a poem . When I arrived this morning at Anna's apartment, she told me that a full day lay ahead: We'd go shopping for supplies to create a prototype of a new RabLabs bowl (a mission that would require walking about 40 city blocks), we'd have searching discussions about creativity, and we'd get our hands really dirty. Hey, who ever said innovating was a cakewalk? ""I tell my students, 'If it's easy to create, someone has probably already created it,'"" says Anna, who teaches product design at Parsons The New School for Design. ""Work through the setbacks, and you can make things no one else has."" Like the unique items in Anna's home, for example. The light fixture that resembles an upside-down red umbrella. The key ring of plastic doodads she assembled for her 1-year-old, Talia, to teethe on. (""Her body is telling her to bite. She must bite! So I give her these, to keep her from biting me."") The little cloth squares she sewed for Talia and her 3-year-old brother, Izzy, to sleep with -- they're soft and worn, and hand-embroidered with trees and abstract whorls and the babies' initials. ""I cut them from my husband's old T-shirts,"" says Anna, whose husband, Aden Fine, is a lawyer for the ACLU. Even Anna's home is an Anna original: Three years ago, she and Aden bought a dim studio in a former sewing factory, then gut-renovated the space into a snug two-bedroom nest, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a kitchen bedecked in vintage red tiles. Anna's mother, Lisa, arrives to take Talia to baby dance class just as Anna is describing her collaborations with New York's Hospital for Special Surgery. ""My dad made surgical instruments,"" says Anna, who has helped create an artificial knee and an assistive device for people recovering from elbow surgery. ""He was a pediatric ophthalmologist and surgeon. He taught me how to sew and solder."" ""She has her father's hand-eye coordination,"" Lisa chimes in. ""And such fine-motor control."" ""Thank you,"" Anna says, looking moved. She pulls out her sewing kit from the 1890s -- her father, who died in 2001, bought it at an antiques market. ""Look at all these crazy needles,"" she says. There are thick needles, teeny needles, needles that look like fish hooks. ""I sew by hand,"" she tells me, ""so the project will be imbued with my love."" Oprah.com: How to write a poem . After Lisa and Talia depart, Anna and I go on a coffee run. I ask her about Stanford's Joint Program in Design -- where she was the third-ever person to graduate with both an MFA in design and an MS in engineering. For her thesis, she traveled to Australia, enticed kangaroos to bounce on treadmills while she tracked their motion using high-speed video, and created chairs that mimic their movements. ""A kangaroo uses its tail like a third leg, leaning on it to push off for the next hop,"" Anna explains. When you sit in her kangaroo chair, it reclines on its curved tail and gently bounces forward -- like a movie theater seat only much more fun. While I'm still processing the concept of marsupial furniture, Anna is already onto the business at hand: buying materials for the RabLabs bowl prototype. She's envisioning a ceramic vessel encrusted with crystal-like formations -- sort of an inside-out geode. She'll make the mock-up with real crystal, using clay to affix the stones to a steel mixing bowl, then create a mold of the whole piece, which she'll use to cast the ceramic version. Beneath her desk, wrapped in Portuguese newspaper, is 50 pounds of Brazilian crystal waiting for its shot at glory. To find the right steel bowl, we visit a baking shop. The place is packed ceiling-high with little objects that light up all kinds of circuits in Anna's mind: shiny pastry tips (""These could be molds for crystal-covered salt and pepper shakers""), cardboard cake bases laminated in gold paper (""We'll use this as a work surface -- the gold feels auspicious""), and an accordion squeeze bottle (""I don't know why, but I need this""). On the way out, Anna marvels at pouches of red, brown, and yellow goo -- pastry filling, it turns out -- and decides it's lunchtime. As she eats her chicken-chermoula sandwich, bought from a food truck on Fifth Avenue, Anna says, ""There's this book called 'I Stink!' "" ""I stink?"" ""It's about a garbage truck that adores gross stuff,"" she says, ""like dog poop and fish heads. Izzy laughed and laughed when my husband read it to him, because it's a bit mischievous. Kids have to follow so many rules, but a book like 'I Stink!' lets them be vicariously rascally without breaking the rules. Designing is like that. The rule is that the object has to perform its function. But within that rule, you can do anything -- the object can be witty or silly or weird."" We nod, considering this. ""You stink,"" I say. Anna smiles. ""I stink!"" Oprah.com: Essential pleasures . After lunch, we head downtown to buy clay from the art supply store -- though Anna beelines for the gift wrap and letterpress stationery (""This is paper geek heaven!""). In the pen aisle, she laments that her favorite model, the Pilot Razor Point II, has been unavailable for the past year. In its place she's been using pens her Korean students brought her from their visits home. She puts a squat, gray felt-tip to a sheet of paper, moving her arm as decisively as a symphony conductor. ""That's what's called an emotive line,"" she says. In the way a jagged line might suggest turmoil and a squiggle could evoke confusion, Anna's ascending swoop reads joie de vivre. Then she draws a guy with big curly hair. Back at the office, she puts on Hall & Oates's ""Kiss on My List"" and lays out the gold work surface, the gray clay, and translucent columns of crystal in sizes ranging from raspberry to cucumber. We begin cocooning the bowl with clay for the crystals to smoosh into, as I explain that I'm much too impatient to be good at making things. ""I'm always rushing to finish,"" I tell her. ""I don't have it in me to keep refining until it's perfect."" Looking at the prototype, it seems I've proven myself right: One side is stunning, and the other side is mine. Anna has anchored two eight-inch columns of quartz in the clay surrounding the bowl and is now accentuating them with smaller satellite crystals. She's edging the place where the clay meets the rock into a kind of cuticle to the crystal's nail. If you squint, you can envision the final product: an improbable, precious thing, plucked from the Earth and yet made by a human hand. Anna turns the cardboard and considers my work. She adds more cuticles, tweaks the angles of the crystals, and carves where I've over-clayed. But for all her refining, what I've contributed -- my inter-crystal spacing, rim-smoothing, and reinforced clay base -- remains. It's just been gently Anna-fied. ""This is really interesting work!"" she says, seeming to sense my hunger for praise. Anna likes to say that a designer must understand human need: Check. A designer must also find creative potential in what's around her, and Anna does -- in bouncing kangaroos and ratty T-shirts and charmless studio apartments. Think of her as a human sea fan, open to the myriad unknown things riding the current, which she uses to make the world a little more fascinating, and a little more Anna, than it would otherwise be.

"(CNN) -- McLaren have officially unveiled the car they hope will rocket Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button into the Formula One title reckoning in 2011. The team's English drivers were on hand as their new MP4-26 car was assembled part-by-part with the help of competition winners in the center of the German capital Berlin on Friday. McLaren have won just one world championship since 1998 and lagged behind Ferrari and Red Bull last year. But they are hoping a raft of new features on their car will propel them into the drivers' championship running. Hamilton, the 2008 world title winner, finished fourth in 2010, 16 points behind the eventual winner, Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull. Button, who succeeded Hamilton as world champion in 2009, came 42 points off the pace in fifth. The MP4-26 is packed with innovative features to help with its aerodynamics, including an electronically adjustable rear-wing system and an all-new electric hybrid KERS system, to comply with this season's F1 rule changes. ""We've seen it in the wind tunnel quite a lot, but it looks even better full-size,"" Hamilton said on Formula One official website. ""I think people saw a unique way of revealing our 2010 car, something that's never been done before. I hope the car proves just as innovative once we take to the track. ""I head into 2011 in a relaxed but determined frame of mind. I've spared nothing during my winter fitness preparations and, in many ways, I feel as fit, focused and refreshed as I did ahead of my first season in Formula One in 2007. ""So my aim for this year is to ensure that everything comes together in the best possible way and that, like last year, I'm able to fight for the title right down to the final race."" Hamilton's teammate Button said it was an ""empowering feeling"" having had an input on the design of McLaren's new car. He said he was looking forward to testing the car in Spain next week, ahead of the opening race in Bahrain on March 13. ""Today really marks the beginning of our 2011 season after what seems a very long time away from the track,"" he said. ""I can't wait to get behind the wheel of MP4-26 for the first time next week. ""It's strange to think that this is only the start of my second season at McLaren Mercedes, because I've felt so comfortable since joining the team last January. ""For the new season, I've not only got a year's experience under my belt, but I've also been able to offer input into the design and development of the new car -- something that I was naturally unable to do last year.""","McLaren Mercedes unveil their car for the 2011 Formula One season .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Nine crew members aboard the French speed sailing trimaran l'Hydroptere were injured on Sunday when the boat flipped while traveling at more than 60 knots (over 110 kilometers an hour) off the southern coast of France. Capsized: French trimaran l'Hydroptere floats upside-down after flipping in high winds Sunday. The boat, which is the world's fastest yacht over one nautical mile, has been trying to claim the world outright speed sailing record, which would require an average speed of 60 miles per hour (about 52 knots or 96 kilometers per hour) over 500 meters. The current record is held by French kite surfer Alexandre Caizergues who managed an average speed of 50.57 knots. Sunday's accident occurred in heavy wind gusts of over 45 knots off Napoléon beach at Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône, near Marseille. View photos of the capsized boat » . A statement from the l'Hydroptere team said the nine crew members had sustained minor injuries when an unexpectedly strong squall hit the boat and capsized it. All of the crew had escaped serious injury and rescue crews on standby managed to pick them up from the water. A spokeswoman from the team told CNN it was understood the mast may have been broken, which could put the boat out of action for several months. • Read more about the intense race to become the fastest boat on the planet. The team skipper Alain Thebault and his crew had organized for the trimaran to be towed to shore and moored in Fos sur Mer, before being put in dry dock to assess the damage. The spokeswoman said conditions were too rough to remove the boat from the water on Sunday, so it was hoped this would be done Monday afternoon. Despite the injuries, the crew were delighted to have achieved speeds of more than 60 knots, as it had confirmed the boat's potential, the spokeswoman said. It was understood that no other vessels as large as l'Hydroptere had managed to pass the 60 knots barrier. Its top speed of 61 knots equates to about 112 kilometers per hour or 70 miles per hour.","French speed sailing trimaran l'Hydroptere capsized on Sunday off France .

Mohamed Geele will be permanently expelled from Denmark when his prison term is complete, according to the sentence. Prosecutors had sought 12 years in prison for Geele. ""This is a good result, and I am very pleased with the way that it has gone,"" District Attorney Kristen Dyman said. Geele was convicted Thursday of attempted terrorism, attempted manslaughter and attacking a police officer with a knife and an ax, according to prosecutors. Authorities said Geele tried to break into the home of cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on January 1, 2010. He cracked a window, which set off an alarm and sent police to the home. An officer shot Geele in the hand and leg. Westergaard, who was home with his 5-year-old granddaughter at the time of the break-in, hid in a ""panic room"" when he realized what was happening, authorities said. Westergaard is ordinarily accompanied by bodyguards when he leaves his home, but nobody was on guard at the house that day, the Security and Intelligence Service told CNN. Danish intelligence officials linked Geele to an East African Islamist militia allied with al Qaeda. Although Geele had been under surveillance because of his alleged terrorist associations, Danish authorities said they had no idea Geele was planning an attack on Westergaard. The cartoonist has said he wanted his controversial drawing to show that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terrorism. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's prime minister, Ali Mujawar, on Monday defended his government, saying there is no reason Egypt-style protests should take off in the country. ""Yemen is not Tunisia or Egypt,"" he said. ""Yemen has its own different situation... Yemen is a democratic country. Through all the stages, elections took place. And therefore this is a democratic regime."" He accused opposition parties of ""trying to duplicate what happened in Tunisia and Egypt, and act as if it should be imposed on the people here in Yemen."" Last Thursday, thousands of anti-government demonstrators gathered near Sanaa University in Yemen's capital. People of all ages chanted and held signs with messages against poverty and the government. Many not only expressed solidarity with the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt but also demanded that Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has been in office for 32 years, needed to step down. While the protests in recent weeks in Yemen have been on a smaller scale than in Tunisia and Egypt, analysts say that Yemeni protesters are seeking many of the same things -- particularly a government that they feel represents them and that will provide them with more economic opportunities. President Saleh recently announced that he would not seek re-election in 2013, after more than three decades in office, and won't install his son to replace him. He also has asked his political opponents ""to re-engage in dialogue in hopes of reaching a sustainable and reconcilable political agreement,"" the Yemeni government said. Prime Minister Mujawar said that if the opposition responds negatively to the president's initiative, ""democratic life in Yemen will continue because it does not rely only on the opposition of 'joint meeting parties.' We have the people of Yemen who want to see the implementation of their constitutional entitlements through parliamentary elections."" Asked whether political turmoil in Yemen could benefit al Qaeda, Mujawar responded, ""Absolutely -- everything is possible. Those extremists who are in Yemen found a suitable environment where there is poverty and unemployment. ""By the way, they also take advantage of Yemen's terrain, which is complex and difficult -- it is mountainous and has widespread desert areas,"" he added. ""They are now spread in rural areas and therefore, the size of their attacks are not frequent and they happen at specific times in the cities.""","Yemen saw a large anti-government demonstration last week .

"(CNN) -- In an effort to galvanize support for a new pair of rail tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey, two U.S. senators from the Garden State announced Monday that Amtrak would bear some of the costs. The $13.5 billion Gateway Tunnel project would add high-speed and commuter rail service between the two states by 2020, replacing an earlier project that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, rejected after citing budget concerns. ""New Jersey is facing a transportation crisis,"" Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg said Monday. He said residents were ""fed up"" with train delays and ""endless traffic"" on New Jersey highways. Lautenberg joined fellow Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez and Amtrak President Joseph Boardman at the Pennsylvania Rail Station in Newark, New Jersey, saying the government-owned rail corporation would spend $50 million to begin preliminary engineering and design, according to a press release from Lautenberg's office. ""It is a critical first step that we can take now to bring 220 mph Amtrak high-speed service to the Northeast Corridor,"" said Boardman, according to the release. Amtrak was not immediately available to verify the proposed spending plan. Christie rejected a similar project in October after ""no agreement was reached on terms that would assure New Jersey's taxpayers would not pay more than $2.7 billion for a completed Trans Hudson Express ARC project."" ""The question is who's going to pay for it,"" said New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Gov. Christie said that there was obligations potentially for the taxpayers of New Jersey that he didn't feel they should shoulder."" ""That's his decision to make,"" Bloomberg added. The Access to the Region's Core project, also known as the Trans Hudson Express ARC project, would have created 6,000 jobs, with federal cost estimates ranging between $9.8 billion and $12.7 billion. Lautenberg was among its proponents and led public criticism against the governor's decision to put the project on hold and ultimately cancel it. ""The critical difference to ARC is that Gateway will add far less capacity for New Jersey Transit, though still a considerable amount,"" said Martin Robins, a former director of New Jersey Transit's Waterfront Transportation office. ""The operators would be a lot happier having ARC-lite than nothing."" But the state also is facing a projected budget gap of $10.5 billion for the next fiscal year. The New Jersey governor has made deficit reduction a cornerstone of his administration, pushing cuts to education, local governments and mass transit and tackling state pension plans and benefits packages for public-sector workers. Christie is expected to deliver his annual budget presentation February 22. CNN's Raelyn Johnson contributed to this report.","Senators say Amtrak would spend $50 million for $13.5 billion tunnel project .

"(CNN)  -- Two-time defending Fed Cup champions Italy battled back to level at 1-1 against Australia in Saturday's first-round tie in the women's tennis teams competition, while 2010 runners-up the United States went 2-0 behind against Belgium. In the two other World Group ties to be completed this weekend, France took at 2-0 lead over four-time champions Russia while the Czech Republic gained a 2-0 advantage over 2002 winners Slovakia, with two more singles and one doubles match left to play . There will be everything to play for at Hobart's Domain tennis center on Sunday, after wins for Australia's Jarmila Groth and Italy's Flavia Pennetta in the opening singles matches left the first-round tie finely poised. World number 31 Groth got the home side off to a good start in the Tasmanian city, fighting her way to an impressive 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 6-3 victory over reigning French Open champion Francesca Schiavone. ""It is my first Fed Cup singles and it is very important and exciting, and I beat someone who is No. 4 in the world,"" Groth, winner of the WTA tournament held in Hobart in January, told the official Fed Cup website. ""It is one of the great wins for me and I am happy and excited."" But French Open runner-up and world number five Sam Stosur could not repeat Groth's success, with Pennetta winning the equally-close encounter 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 -- the first time an Italian has beaten an Australian in the nations' sixth meeting in the competition. ""We both fought hard and wanted to win the point for our teams. She had a few chances in the first and second sets but I was playing well,"" Pennetta said. ""This match was decided by one or two points and it was a really good match. I think the crowd enjoyed it."" Stosur and Schiavone will now face each other in a repeat of their Roland Garros final on Sunday, as the two nations target a place in April's semifinals. The U.S. team, defeated by the Italians in the last two Fed Cup finals, made a disappointing start to their 2011 campaign after Belgium's pairing of Kim Clijsters and Yanina Wickmayer proved too strong for Melanie Oudin and Bethanie Mattek-Sands. Newly-crowned Australian Open champion Clijsters and world number 31 Wickmayer have put Belgium just one win away from a place in the last four. Wickmayer delighted the home crowd in Antwerp with a 6-1 7-6 (8-6) win over the flamboyant Mattek-Sands, before Clijsters -- showing no signs of fatigue following her win in Melbourne -- dispatched Oudin 6-0 6-4. ""It was fun to be out here playing again,"" said the world number two, who will seal victory for her country if she beats Mattek-Sands in Sunday's first singles match. ""Obviously it's nice to come here and play here after a win because the people have been so supportive. I've kept them up during the night with the time change with Australia and it's nice to be back here."" The Czech Republic look likely to be Belgium's opponents in the semifinals after dominating against eastern European neighbors Slovakia. World number 30 Lucie Safarova opened proceedings in the Slovak capital Bratislava with a 6-1 7-5 win over former top-10 player Daniela Hantuchova. In-form Australian Open quarterfinalist Petra Kvitova, ranked a career-high 18 in the world, then disposed of Dominika Cibulkova 6-2 6-3. ""I made a great start,"" said Kvitova, who faces Hantuchova in Sunday's first reverse singles.""Yesterday Lucie and I were joking about 2-0, and we are very happy about it -- but we didn't really expect it."" France could be next up for the winners of the battle between Australia and Italy after stunning a strong Russia line-up at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow. Alize Cornet, the world number 67, did not let an ankle injury affect her in a 3-6 6-3 6-4 win over double grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. Former world number one Maria Sharapova, still struggling to get back to the top of the game after a string of injury problems, was then dismantled 6-4 6-3 by 83rd-ranked Virginie Razzano. Should Kuznetsova and Sharapova fare better in Sunday's reverse singles matches, the result of the tie could come down to a doubles match set to feature another struggling former world number one, Dinara Safina.","Italy level at 1-1 with Australia after opening day of 2011 Fed Cup competition .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer representing two U.S. hikers jailed in Iran has been denied a request to visit his clients on the eve of their trial, he told CNN on Saturday. ""I asked to see them before the trial, but the judge told me I couldn't,"" said Masoud Shafii. The judge has granted Shafii permission to visit Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal for a few hours on Sunday prior to the start of the trial, Shafii said. Bauer and Fattal, both 28, and Sarah Shourd, 32, were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Prosecutors in Iran have charged them with spying and trespassing. Human rights groups have condemned their arrests and their lengthy wait for a trial in Tehran's notorious Evin prison. Last September, Iranian authorities released Shourd on bail because of a medical condition. Shourd has not responded to a court summons this week to return and stand trial on Sunday, Shafii said. Iranian authorities said she will be tried in absentia if she doesn't appear in court. Shafii told CNN he has reviewed his clients' case file and doesn't see any evidence of a crime. ""In my opinion, they haven't done anything wrong,"" Shafii said. ""The accusation of spying is baseless, and if they trespassed into Iran, it wasn't their fault."" Shafii said the border area where the hikers are accused of trespassing is unmarked and anyone could unwittingly cross over into Iran.","Lawyer Masoud Shafii says he was denied access to the hikers Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Planned Parenthood defended a Virginia clinic and one of its employees Thursday against the latest attempt at an undercover video ""sting"" by conservative activists, telling reporters its clinic worker acted properly. The anti-abortion group Live Action has sent operatives posing as a pimp and prostitute to Planned Parenthood clinics in several states, trying to persuade clinic workers to help them discreetly obtain abortions for minors supposedly in the sex trade. Planned Parenthood said the woman in the latest clip Live Action released ""reacted professionally to a highly unusual person posing as a patient."" ""After the encounter, the staff member immediately notified her supervisor, who subsequently notified members of Planned Parenthood's national security team, who are working with the FBI, which is investigating these visits,"" the organization said. Live Action and its founder, California anti-abortion activist Lila Rose, have accused Planned Parenthood workers of covering up the sexual abuse of minors. The reproductive health organization vehemently denies the allegation -- but it fired a clinic worker in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, earlier this week after the woman was caught on video in another of Live Action's stings. The New Jersey worker appears to advise the fake pimp and prostitute how to avoid mandatory reporting laws for abortion and how to find another provider in case an underage girl needs an abortion. Planned Parenthood spokesman Stuart Schear called the remarks ""repugnant"" and ""completely inconsistent with Planned Parenthood's guidelines."" In a statement issued Thursday, Rose said her group shot the latest footage in a clinic in Richmond and argues it shows the counselor ""coaching a pimp about how girls as young as 14-15 could circumvent parental consent laws for secret abortions."" The clinic worker depicted in the video describes Virginia's law, including a provision that authorizes a judge to waive the parental notification provision. Planned Parenthood says it reported the visits by the undercover ""pimps"" and ""prostitutes"" to federal authorities in January, while raising the possibility that they could have been hoaxes. It says the FBI is investigating the matter. Planned Parenthood called on Live Action to release the raw footage of the visit. Rose said Live Action has shared the full footage with Virginia authorities and has asked state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli -- an outspoken abortion opponent -- to investigate.","Planned Parenthood says the Virginia clinic worker acted properly .

"(CNN) -- Flames danced hundreds of feet in the east Texas sky hours after a fire broke out at a natural gas and chemical facility. There were no injuries reported at the fire in Mont Belvieu, about 35 miles east of Houston, said Rick Rainey, a spokesman for Enterprise Products. A worker who was unaccounted for was believed to be away from the site, but the company was conducting a search, Rainey said. The fire broke out shortly after noon at a facility used to store natural gas liquids. The cause was not known. A two-mile perimeter was cleared around the plant. A nearby school restricted outdoor activities. ""The plant is within five miles of the school and according to the emergency command center, there is no indication that the fire is of a toxic nature, since they believe the fuel driving the flame is natural gas,"" said Barbers Hill Superintendent Greg Poole. ""Additionally, the wind is blowing away from us."" ""We don't believe this is a safety issue,"" Poole said. ""However, we do have a lot of parents here at the school who are employees over at Enterprise, so that's caused a lot of concern for us here.""

"(CNN)  -- Two storied teams ... two superstar quarterbacks ... an iconic venue. Sunday's Super Bowl XLV between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers at the Cowboys Stadium in Dallas has all the ingredients to match the inevitable hype which accompanies America's love affair with the finale of the NFL season. Streets will be deserted as well over 100 million watch on television in the United States alone and it's not just the action on the pitch which attracts the massive audience. The list of acts who have performed in the pre-game and halftime entertainment is a who's who of rock and pop celebrity, including Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones and The Who. This year pop icon Christina Aguilera will sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" just prior to kickoff while the halftime headline act is the hip-hop group Black Eyed Peas. The Super Bowl is America's World Cup final . Indeed, one of the most talked about incidents at a Super Bowl took place in the halftime show in 2004 when Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"" raised eyebrows and became the most watched clip on the internet. This year's performers, lacking the traditional cheerleaders as neither of the two teams has them, will be hoping to avoid the sort of mishap which befell Jackson, while on the pitch the pressure will be even more immense. The Pittsburgh Steelers have claimed more Super Bowl wins than an other franchise with six against one defeat, the Green Bay Packers took the first two in 1967 and 1968 with a further triumph in 1996. The Steelers have also won a record eight AFC (American Football Conference) championships, including their 24-19 victory over the New York Jets to reach this season's Super Bowl. The Packers claimed a record nine NFL championships before the Super Bowl was instituted and their 21-14 victory over arch-rivals the Chicago Bears was their third NFC (National Football Conference) championship. So with two teams with a lengthy history and impeccable pedigree a classic showdown is in prospect, particularly as the last meeting between them ended with a nail-biting 37-36 win for the Steelers. Much of the pre-match hullabaloo centered around the team's star quarterbacks, Ben Roethlisberger for the Steelers, Aaron Rodgers of the Packers. They were given their own podiums to address the mass ranks on Tuesday's traditional media day while other players had to do with designated spots in the stands at the Cowboys stadium. Quarterbacks hold the key . But with that spotlight comes an awesome responsibility, a misplaced or intercepted pass can mean the difference between triumph or despair in the Super Bowl with its history littered with tales of under performing quarterbacks. Roethlisberger has been there and done it, helping the Steelers to Super Bowl wins in the 2005 and 2008 seasons, his 35-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes clinching their most recent triumph. And it was ""Big Ben's"" pass to receiver Mike Wallace in the final play of the game which gave the Steelers that narrow one-point win over the Packers the last time they met just over a year ago. ""We were fortunate enough to get a win but what happened in Heinz Field in 2009 is going to have no bearing in this stadium. So many of the components of these teams are different,"" said Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin. Rodgers finally took over the mantle at the Packers from the great Brett Favre in 2008 and in his five-year professional career is the NFL all-time leader for the highest percentage of completed passes in the regular season with the lowest number of interceptions. It demonstrates a precision that may prove invaluable come Sunday night as he seeks his first Super Bowl ring. Packers'  fans will be hoping Rodgers gets the chance to dust off his unique touchdown celebration, dubbed ""The Championship Belt"". After a touchdown or scoring play, Rodgers makes a motion as if putting an imaginary belt around his waist. Pittsburgh will be banking on their highly-rated defense to get to grips early with the Super Bowl rookie and disrupt his rhythm. World's largest domed stadium . So the stage set for a classic in a stadium which, it being in Texas, prides itself on being the biggest and the best. According to the official Dallas Cowboys website, it is the largest domed stadium in the world, has the world's largest retractable glass doors at each end and possesses the world's largest video screen. The world's largest freestanding support holds it all up with the stadium able to seat 80,000 fans with a maximum capacity of 110,000. If a clutch of out-of-stadium tickets to watch on a big screen are counted, the record for a championship game, of 103,985 at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in California for the 1980 NFL championship game, could well be broken. With such huge interest and despite the economic downturn in the United States, advertisers are still willing to stump up an eye-watering $3 million for a 30-second slot on the transmission by Fox with the commercials ""take"" set to be another record. The only cloud on the horizon in the build-up to match day was the appalling weather in Dallas, with sub-zero temperatures forcing both teams inside to practice and the Cowboys stadium shrouded in snow. The cold snap was forecast to continue through the weekend.","Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers contest Super Bowl XLV in Dallas .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Evidence found on the bodies of two men killed by a now-jailed U.S. diplomat aligns with the State Department's claim that the men were robbers, according to a Pakistani police official. Raymond Davis, who works at the U.S. consulate in Lahore, Pakistan, has been jailed since January 27, when authorities say he shot and killed two men on a motorcycle. Davis said the men attacked him while trying to rob him as he drove through a busy neighborhood, according to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan. When police searched the bodies, they found stolen cell phones and cash that belonged to two men who had reported being robbed earlier that day by two gunmen on a motorcycle, a Pakistani police official told CNN. The official identified the dead men as Faheem Shamshad, 26, and Faizan Haider, 22. Their families filed police reports accusing Davis of murder, a police spokesman said. A third person, Muhammad Abad ur Rehman, allegedly was struck and killed by a U.S. consulate car responding to the shooting. Police are investigating the death, but the U.S. Embassy has not revealed the identity of the person driving that car despite calls from Pakistani authorities to do so. On Thursday, a judge in Lahore ordered the government to hold Davis for at least eight more days and place his name on an exit control list to ensure he does not leave the country. In a statement on its website, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said its employee shot two armed men in self-defense and renewed its call for the Pakistani government to release him, saying he is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Speculation in the Pakistani media has suggested that Davis was traveling on a business visa and that he was consequently not subject to diplomatic protections. U.S. officials notified Pakistan's Foreign Ministry that the employee was in the country on diplomatic business, and details about his passport and visa were irrelevant, countered acting U.S. embassy spokeswoman Courtney Beale. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Wednesday that the U.S. government is in ""constant contact"" with the Pakistan government. ""We continue to encourage the government of Pakistan to respect his diplomatic immunity and to release him,"" Crowley said. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari urged people not to use the incident for ""political point scoring,"" spokesman Farhatullah Babar said. ""The president said that the government had taken a principled position, that the matter was before the judiciary whose verdict should be awaited and respected,"" Babar said. The case has sparked some protest and fueled anti-American sentiments in Pakistan. During several protests this week, hard-line clerics condemned the shootings and demanded the government not release Davis to the U.S. government. Local television showed a rally in Karachi where protesters re-enacted their version of shooting incident. Men wearing smiling masks and holding toy guns played the part of Davis and gleefully danced around several protesters who pretended to be the shooting victims. CNN's Reza Sayah and journalists Nasir Habib and Nosheen Abbas contributed to this story.","Evidence suggests the men killed by the diplomat were robbers, police say .

"(CNN) -- Yemen is tightening security at all of its airports in the aftermath of a plot to send bombs from Yemen to the United States, the country's National Civil Aviation Security Committee said Monday. ""Every piece of cargo and luggage will go through extensive searching"" at all of its airports, the agency said. Cargo companies such as DHL, FedEx and UPS will be required to make more stringent checks before accepting any packages, according to the committee. Other countries also put restrictions in place Monday in reaction to the security concern. Germany banned all incoming flights from Yemen, air traffic control officials said. And in the United Kingdom, Home Secretary Theresa May told Parliament that all passenger and cargo flights, as well as all flights holding unaccompanied freight from Yemen and Somalia, will be banned for a month, at which time the measure will be reviewed. Somalia was included in the ban because of the possibility of contact between al Qaeda in Yemen and terrorist groups there. Britain banned passengers from carrying toner cartridges larger than 500 grams in hand baggage on flights departing the country. South Korea is stepping up security ahead of a summit of world leaders next week, it announced Monday. Incheon International Airport will inspect all air cargo coming from destinations on the list of nations that sponsor terrorism, South Korean customs said Monday. The FBI has dispatched teams of explosive experts to the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates to help examine the explosives found late last week, a federal law enforcement official said. The parcel companies also remained on alert. FedEx, for instance, is not transporting or accepting any parcels originating from Yemen, spokesman Jim McCluskey said. The company continues to work with U.S. authorities to assure that the highest safety levels are met, he said. It also is working to clear packages that have been held since Friday. An embargo on shipments from Yemen, which was set to expire Monday, was extended through November 8, a U.S. Transportation Security Administration official said. A senior Yemeni government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the decisions to cancel flights and shipments out of Yemen will be interpreted as a ""collective punishment"" against the country. The Yemeni public will see it as a collective punishment for unclear gains, the official said. Nobody benefits from this except al Qaeda, he added. Meanwhile, Yemeni authorities are intensifying operations to capture militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and to capture or kill al Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, the senior official said. Investigators in Yemen strongly suspect that al-Asiri, al Qaeda's top bomb maker in the region, is behind the explosive devices sent in the parcels, he said. U.S. authorities are also looking at al-Asiri because the parcel bombs used the same explosive, PETN, as last year's foiled underwear bomber, also linked to him. Authorities, however, have not divulged details about the purported links between al-Asiri and the explosives. Yemen needs ""a lot of help"" to fight al Qaeda, an aide to the country's prime minister said Monday. ""Al Qaeda has got a global sort of agenda, so you need global collaboration and regional collaboration,"" Mohammed Qubaty said. ""We need a lot of help as regards security information, logistics,"" and new ways to confront them, he said, even as he emphasized that Yemen does not want foreign troops on its soil. ""We have got our security and our armed forces on the ground there,"" he said, saying the country does not want to become another Iraq, presumably referring to the 2003 U.S. invasion. The U.S. military commander credited with helping reduce violence in Iraq said Washington had been concerned about Yemen for some time. ""When I was the commander in Iraq, we already saw the problems starting to loom in Yemen,"" Gen. David Petraeus said. He said that when he was in charge of all U.S. military forces in the region, ""We did focus a great deal of additional attention on helping our Yemeni partners there, and the events of recent days have shown why that was valid."" On Friday, authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two packages with explosives that were destined for synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. The explosive found in the United Arab Emirates may have traveled on passenger planes to get there, airline officials said Sunday. Both explosives appear to have been designed to detonate on their own, without someone having to set them off, the top White House counterterrorism official said. ""It is my understanding that these devices did not need somebody to detonate them,"" said John Brennan, President Barack Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. U.S. investigators believe that bomb maker al-Asiri, 28, is linked to that package and another one found on an airplane in Britain's East Midlands Airport on Friday, a federal official, who was briefed by authorities, said Sunday. Al-Asiri, who is thought to be in Yemen, is a Saudi who was high on Saudi Arabia's list of most wanted published in February 2009. He is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year's attempt to blow up an airliner on December 25. ""The thinking is it's the same person or group of people that built the underwear bomb because of the way it's put together,"" said a U.S. government official, who had been briefed by multiple U.S. authorities and law enforcement sources. ""But this one is about four times as powerful."" Separately, an engineering student arrested in Yemen was released Sunday, along with her mother, according to her father, Mohammed Al-Samawi. Human rights attorney Abdul-Rahman Barman earlier identified her as Hanan Al-Samawi, a fifth-year student at Sanaa University in the Yemeni capital. A high-level source in the United Arab Emirates said Hanan Al-Samawi's name was found on the cargo manifest of the device found in Dubai. She said Monday that she was not guilty. ""I am totally innocent, and there is no proof against me, and that's why I have been released,"" she said. Authorities do not have any American suspects, a U.S. official said. Two schools in Yemen were being looked at in connection with the plot and had been on the radar of U.S. officials, the official said. The explosive device found in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was contained in a Hewlett-Packard printer and had a motherboard originating from a mobile phone but did not have a SIM card in it, the high-level source said. The device was professionally assembled, the source said. The motherboard was connected by a striker to the printer head and then to the cartridge, which was filled with explosives. Authorities have the serial number of the motherboard and the printer, and they are searching to see where it was sold, how it was paid for and what information they can glean about the people who performed those transactions, according to the source. Authorities believe an explosive device found at the East Midlands airport flew from Yemen to a Persian Gulf state and then to Cologne, Germany, the official said. The device was then transferred onto a UPS plane. Investigators are still attempting to retrace the route of the Dubai device, according to the high-level official. Some believe that it went to Doha, Qatar, on Qatar Airways, where it spent the night before traveling to Dubai the following day. However, it does appear the devices flew on commercial passenger planes, the high-level official said. Screening the devices would have been difficult, since printers normally contain computer parts and wires, according to Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent. American authorities are now endorsing British Prime Minister David Cameron's position that the explosives were designed to take down an airplane, the official said. However, a U.S. official said Sunday that the United States has not drawn any conclusions on the intent of the bombs and whether they were intended to explode in flight, at the synagogues or somewhere else. American and British authorities think al Qaeda's branch in Yemen is linked to the plot. A key figure in the group is al-Awlaki, the American-born Yemeni militant cleric whom U.S. authorities have linked to Fort Hood shooting suspect Maj. Nidal Hasan and the man accused in the Christmas Day bomb attempt. On Friday, Brennan declined to name al-Awlaki specifically as a suspect. ""Anybody who's associated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a subject of concern,"" he said. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration is sending six inspectors to Yemen to help improve cargo security, an official with the agency said Sunday. ""Even before this incident, 100 percent of identified high-risk cargo on inbound passenger planes was being screened,"" TSA Administrator John S. Pistole said in a statement Sunday, noting that security procedures will evolve based on the latest intelligence information. Over the past several months, Yemen, which wants to be seen as a committed partner in the fight against terrorism, has launched several offensives against al Qaeda in its country but has not captured al-Awlaki.

"(CNN) -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia arrived in Casablanca, Morocco, on Saturday to continue his recovery from back surgery late last year, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. The king, who was met by Moroccan King Mohammed VI, will undergo physical therapy in the north African country following treatment in the United States for a herniated disc and a blood clot that was causing him back pain, according to Saudi state media. He underwent his first surgery November 24 at New York's Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. A follow-up surgery to stabilize several vertebrae in his spine was performed December 3.

"(CNN) -- Three teens, one a U.S. citizen, were killed in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez this weekend, a spokesman with the Chihuahua state prosecutor's office said late Monday. The killing was the first case this year of an American student being killed in Juarez, which has been beset recently by violence and is just across the border from El Paso, Texas, spokesman Arturo Sandoval said. The shooting happened at 4:22 p.m. Saturday at a car dealership, where the teens were looking at cars, according to Sandoval. Police recovered at least 18 bullet casings at the scene from an AK-47, an automatic weapon commonly used by drug traffickers in the city. Two of the victims were born in Ciudad Juarez and were identified as Carlos Mario Gonzalez Bermudez, 16, and Cesar Yalin Miramontes Jimenez, also 16, according to Sandoval. The other victim, identified as Juan Carlos Echeverri Jr., 15, was born in El Paso, the prosecutor's spokesman said. The teen's parents identified his body over the weekend and confirmed that he was an American citizen. Virginia Staab, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said Monday that U.S. authorities are actively looking into the incident and had not yet confirmed the citizenship of any of the victims. At least one of the victims attended a Juarez prep school called Tecnológico de Monterrey, Sandoval said. A message on the website of Cathedral High School in El Paso asked students and families to remember Bermudez and said he was a sophomore. His fellow students had an assembly and prayer service in his honor Monday morning, the El Paso Times reported. ""We believe (Echeverri) and the two others had been friends for a long time. He was here in the city to visit them,"" Sandoval said. The fatal shootings come on the heels of numerous similar violent incidents in recent months in Juarez. In one 48-hour span last week, for instance, at least 14 people were killed -- including a municipal police officer and a newspaper vendor who police believe was targeted due to her job, according to Juarez Police spokesman Adrian Sanchez.","3 teens killed Saturday at a car dealership in Ciudad Juarez, a spokesman says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's lawyer ""vehemently"" denied that the actress stole a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store last month. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering a felony theft charge against Lohan after her stylist handed over the ""one of a kind necklace"" to police just before they were to search her apartment, according to the police and the prosecutor's spokeswoman. ""We vehemently deny these allegations and, if charges are filed, we will fight them in court, not in the press,"" Lohan lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley said Saturday. Los Angeles County district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons on Saturday denied a media report that a decision had already been made to charge Lohan. ""The case remains under review,"" Sandi Gibbons said. ""When we make a decision, we will let everyone know."" The necklace was valued at $2,500, a statement from the Los Angeles Police Department said. ""As part of the grand theft investigation, detectives with the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific area obtained a search warrant on February 1, 2011, for actress Lindsay Lohan's Venice residence, to search for the necklace,"" the statement said. Lohan, 24, is currently on supervised probation for a drunk driving conviction. The judge overseeing her case told her in October that he would send her to jail for 180 days if she violated her probation rules before her next court appearance, set for February 25. She left the Betty Ford clinic a month ago after three months in a drug rehabilitation program. The rehab stint persuaded the judge not to send Lohan to jail for failing a drug test.

"(CNN) -- Wael Ghonim, a Google executive who has been missing for more than a week following his purported arrest in Cairo, is to be released Monday, according to two Egyptian television news networks. Telecom executive Naguib Sawiris announced on OTV Sunday that Ghonim would be released at 4 p.m. Monday. Sawiris told CNN that Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman assured him during a Sunday meeting between government officials and opposition leaders that Ghonim would be released. State-run Nile TV reported that Prime Minister Ahmad Shafiq called the network to announce that a Google executive missing for more than a week will be released Monday. There was no explanation as to the executive's whereabouts or condition. Sawiris is a member of the so-called Committee of the Wise, a group of independent elite leaders of Egyptian society taking part in talks over the future of the country. The announcements follow the release of a statement earlier Sunday by the human rights group Amnesty International. The statement warned that Ghonim was at risk of being tortured by Egytian authorities. ""The Egyptian authorities must immediately disclose where Wael Ghuneim is and release him or charge him with a recognizable criminal offence,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy director of Middle and North Africa at Amnesty International. ""He must be given access to a doctor and a lawyer of his choice and not be subjected to torture or other ill-treatment. His case is just one of many that highlight the continued crackdown by the Egyptian authorities on those exercising their right to protest peacefully."" Ghonim, according to Amnesty International, was declared missing after he failed to meet with his brother January 28, as planned, to take part in street demonstrations. Ghonim, who heads Google's marketing operations in north Africa and the Middle East, had been in Cairo on a business trip since January 23. Ghonim is from Dubai, according to the human rights group. Family members became concerned when they discovered that Ghonim's telephones had been disconnected, according to the human rights group. Eyewitnesses later told family members they had seen Egyptian authorities arrest Ghonim during demonstrations near Mustafa Mohamed Street.","Egyptian authorities to let Google executive go, executive says .

AZUZ: The primaries, the rallies, the debates: Let's call all that the pre-game. The big show kicks off today, Election Day in the U.S. This has been the most expensive midterm election in U.S. history. And it wraps up today as voters cast their ballots all over the country. What's at stake: control of Congress. You've heard us talk about it. The Democrats currently have a majority in both chambers. Republicans are expected to make gains today. In order to take over that majority, the Republicans need to hold onto the seats that they currently have, plus win 39 more seats in the House of Representatives, 10 more in the Senate. Sandra Endo checks in now with a report on the final push leading up to today's election. (BEGIN VIDEO) SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: One last cry to rally the troops. President Obama was on the campaign trail trying to get out the vote in Cleveland. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Because if everyone who fought for change in 2008 shows up to vote in 2010, we will win this election. I am confident in that. ENDO: Former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and first lady Michelle Obama are fanning out across the country to help in key races, like in Kentucky, Nevada and Delaware. For the Republican Party, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is stumping for GOP Senate candidate John Raese in West Virginia. Republican leaders are looking for big wins, a shift in power, in at least one chamber of Congress. MICHAEL STEELE, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: My goal in talking to our team out in the field is let's get our folks to the 39, because that's the momentum point you really want to go for, and then you can continue to build from there. ENDO: In fact a new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll out Sunday shows a majority of Americans think Republicans will take over control of Congress after the midterm elections: 51 percent to 36 percent. According to the poll, 34 percent say the country will be better off if Republicans win back Congress; 28 percent say the nation will be worse off; and 36 percent say it won't make a difference. Another poll out today shows 75 percent of Americans think things are going badly in the country. It's the worst outlook going into a midterm election since the mid '70s, and the economy remains issue number one on voters' minds. In Washington, Sandra Endo, for CNN Student News.

They were stopped along the way. Yemeni officials say ""every piece of cargo and luggage will go through extensive searching"" at all of the airports in the country. The same thing is happening at airports around the world, like you see right here. As for the response outside of Yemen, Germany and Britain are both banning any flights from Yemen, at least for a while. And shipping companies, like FedEx and UPS, are staying on high alert. The two bombs were discovered on cargo planes. Iraq Church Shooting . AZUZ: In Baghdad, the capital city of Iraq, a Catholic church was the scene of a hostage standoff on Sunday. You might think of Iraq as mostly a Muslim country, but there is a small percentage of people there who are Christian. This standoff started right as the church was about to begin Sunday night services. A group of men carrying guns and explosives took over the church. U.S. military officials say the gunmen took around 120 people hostage. Eventually, Iraqi forces stormed the church. At least 50 people were killed in the violence. Around 75 others were injured.

LINDSAY YUHASZ, ETIQUETTE SCHOOL STUDENT: I want to be the person that they're like, ""This girl is great. When she came in, she smiled, she was confident, she shook my hand well."" I want to be that person. CHO: Which is why these young women are learning how to properly dine, communicate and network. All the little things that can show a potential employer you're up for the job. FITZPATRICK: First of all, you don't go to events to eat, OK? You're not there to eat. So, eat something before you go. CHO: Make eye contact in the area Fitzpatrick calls the triangle. Anything lower is too personal. Once you get the job, know how to eat. There's always a business lunch. Number one rule, eat with the back side of your fork. Cross your utensils while you rest, and leave them parallel at 10:20, like a clock, when you're done. So many details. Does it really matter? Anna Post is the great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post, the woman who literally wrote the book on etiquette. ANNA POST, THE EMILY POST INSTITUTE: This will put you apart from the crowd. There are so many qualified resumes. This is a way to show that the boss can send you out and have absolute confidence that you won't embarrass them in front of the client, bottom line.

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain is about to have a massive expansion in renewable energy after awarding licenses for nine offshore wind farms Friday. The energy generated from the new wind farms will provide a quarter of Britain's electricity needs by 2020, according to the Crown Estate, which awarded the contracts. Companies had bid for the right to build wind farms in nine zones around Britain, from the English Channel to the North Sea off Scotland. The successful bidders must now plan their projects and receive approval before they can build. ""Our island has one of the best wind energy resources in Europe and today's news shows we're creating the right conditions for the energy industry to invest in harnessing it,"" said British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. The wind farms will be able to offer 32 gigawatts, or about a quarter of Britain's electricity needs, said Roger Bright, chief executive of the Crown Estate. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the expansion could provide as many as 70,000 jobs by 2020. He promised to remove any barriers to rapid development. The Crown Estate belongs to the queen and is one of the largest property owners in the United Kingdom. It pays its entire revenue to the British Treasury. It owns half of the United Kingdom's foreshore, 55 percent of tidal river beds and estuaries, and almost the entire seabed out to 12-nautical-mile territorial limit. Under the Energy Act of 2004, the Crown Estate can also issue leases for development beyond the territorial limit, out to 200 nautical miles. Friday's announcement is ""the biggest tender for renewables ever,"" said Antonio Mexia, chairman of EDP Renovaveis, a Portuguese company that won a license to build in the Moray Firth, off Scotland's eastern coast. ""This is about delivering a whole new industry for the U.K., one that provides sustainable, secure, and indigenous power as well as tens of thousands of new jobs throughout the supply chain,"" said Eddie O'Connor, the chief executive of Irish company Mainstream Renewable Power. Mainstream, together with Germany's Siemens Project Ventures, won the license to build off Hornsea, on England's eastern coast.","New wind farms to provide 25 percent of UK's electricity needs .

Today, you'll meet the teenager who did. I'm Carl Azuz. Welcome to CNN Student News! First Up: U.N. General Assembly . AZUZ: First up, leaders from around the world are coming together for a meeting in New York City. It's the United Nations General Assembly, and it gets together every year. The group is going to talk about world issues; different leaders will make speeches. President Obama is scheduled to address the assembly today. So what? Why does it matter that a bunch of leaders are having a meeting? Well, the United Nations General Assembly is made up of 192 countries. And when we say they're talking about world issues, we mean big subjects, like poverty and security, and specific things, like the war in Afghanistan or Iran's nuclear program. They can't create new laws. But the decisions that they make and the policies that they come up with can have a big influence on what goes on in the world. Health Care Provisions . AZUZ: In the health care reform bill that you see President Obama signing over my shoulder here, that might've been his biggest victory of his first two years in office. And parts of that law go into effect this week. For example, you can stay on your parents' health insurance until you're 26, and insurance companies can't turn down children with medical conditions that exist at the time they apply for insurance. Some people were and still are against this law, though. For one thing, it can cost a lot of money. Plus, critics don't like the idea that people have to get health insurance. That part of the bill goes into effect in a few years. What's the Word? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the word? the sector of a country's economy that isn't run by its government . PRIVATE SECTOR . That's the word! Cuban Economy . AZUZ: Running a business in the private sector means risks and rewards. You can set your own prices, but there's no one to really fall back on if things don't go so well. Shasta Darlington looks at what's in store for thousands of Cubans who are about to lose their government jobs and make the shift into the private sector. (BEGIN VIDEO) SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, HAVANA: A tall order in communist Cuba: finding jobs for half a million laid-off workers in the private sector. Here in Old Havana, not everyone is celebrating this capitalist notion. Like it or not, employees at this barbershop around the corner are being pushed off the state payroll and handed the shop. They'll be able to set prices and keep earnings, but they'll now have to pay taxes and rent, and there's no longer the guarantee of a fixed income. GERARDO, HAVANA BARBER [TRANSLATED]: ""I've been working for the state for years now and I'm not interested in going private,"" says Gerardo. ""I want to keep working for the state."" DARLINGTON: Cuba plans to shed ten percent of public sector jobs over the next six months and allow more private enterprise to absorb the unemployed. A dramatic attempt by President Raul Castro to reshape the sputtering economy. He says the state simply can't afford a bloated and unproductive workforce. But don't expect American-style big business. Cuba's new entrepreneurs will be encouraged to start small operations, maybe driving taxis, laying bricks or perhaps repairing toys. Now, to get an idea of what's in store for them, we're talking to some of the people already working in the country's miniscule private sector. Emilio Mendoza was laid off during Cuba's last major economic crisis in the '90s. He bought a government license and set up a cobbler's shop in his driveway. He says Cubans should see this as an opportunity. Isidro, a taxi driver, says it depends on how much the state charges its new entrepreneurs in taxes and licensing fees. They all agree, the days of getting paid by the government, whether you work or lounge about, are over. Still, the state controls about 90 percent of the economy. These modest proposals aren't likely to radically shift that balance, but they will give life to a new class of small businesses that could change the face of Cuba. (END VIDEO) Shoutout .

"(CNN Student News) -- November 29, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • North Korea • Portland, Oregon • Haiti . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: CNN Student News welcomes you back from Thanksgiving break! Hope you had a great turkey day. Here is your commercial-free news on this last Monday in November. First Up: Island Attacked . AZUZ: First up -- things are tense with North Korea. Again. U.S. Senator John McCain says he doesn't think the Asian country really wants war, but that's what it's talking about as the U.S. and South Korea start military exercises off the coast of the Korean peninsula. Here's CNN's Chris Lawrence. CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: You're talking in the neighborhood of about 7,000 American sailors, 75 fighter jets on board. This is going to be a combination of air and sea, last for about four days. And, so, that's when we will have to start really keeping an eye on what North Korea's response will be when those training exercises start. AZUZ: These military exercises have been planned for awhile. North Korea characterizes them as a ""pretext for aggression"" that could ignite a war and says they're creating a state of ""ultra emergency"" in the Korean peninsula. Why do some American lawmakers doubt there'll be a war? Because North Korea's done this sort of thing before -- they've made these threatening statements -- in hopes of getting other countries to pacify North Korea with aid or money. Senator McCain says the U.S. has given North Korea more than a billion dollars in the past 15 years to try to get North Korea to negotiate. So why is that country's threat still serious? Because last week, North Korea attacked a South Korean island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. It said that was in response to military exercises being done by South Korea alone. And North Korea has moved surface-to-air missiles to its border with South Korea. Why does all this matter so much to the U.S.? Well, you know that the U.S. was involved in the 1950s Korean War. Today, America has a defense treaty with South Korea. If war breaks out again between North and South, the U.S. is committed to help defend South Korea. Plot in Portland . AZUZ: The place: Portland, Oregon. The event: The lighting of the city's Christmas tree. The problem: Officials say someone wanted to bomb the celebration, which attracts thousands of people. He failed, as you can see here, the tree shining with lights and the flashes of cameras from the crowd. Those who were here are thankful to the Portland police and the FBI who say this man -- 19-year-old Mohamed Osman Mohamud -- tried to blow up what he thought was a car bomb at the ceremony on Friday night. Police say the Muslim teen was interested in violent religious attacks, but that the people at the event were never in any real danger, because officials had had their eye on Mohamud for a long time. The FBI says it had worked undercover to trap the suspect. This included getting in touch with Mohamud, finding out what he allegedly wanted to attack, and then providing a fake car bomb that Mohamud is accused of trying to detonate several times during the ceremony. Muslim leaders in the Portland area spoke out against the plot and any violence that targets innocent people. Is This Legit? STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is This Legit? Haiti's government is a constitutional monarchy. Not legit! Haiti is a republic; its president is elected by popular vote. Haiti Elections . AZUZ: So Haiti's people may choose their leader directly, but did they have the chance to do it fairly? There were 18 candidates for president in yesterday's election in Haiti. 11 of them say the vote was tainted by fraud all over the country. The leading politician even asked for the election to be canceled! Ivan Watson takes you to the political scene in a country crushed by poverty, disaster and disease. (BEGIN VIDEO) IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Haiti's presidential palace still lies in ruins, but that hasn't stopped these politicians from competing for the top job. Eighteen candidates, mobilizing supporters and money, to win the post of president. Historically, Haitian elections are plagued by violence, allegations of fraud, and logistical problems. This year, election officials say they've trained staff and carefully prepared ballot counting centers to ensure a smoother election. But 48 hours before the polls were scheduled to open, crowds waited in line to receive identification cards that will allow them to vote. At the beginning of this month, hundreds of thousands of ID cards had yet to be distributed. Election workers, disorganized, struggling to maintain order. At least one woman collapses after waiting for hours. And tempers start to flare. Meanwhile, fresh reports of violence. The United Nations says it deployed peacekeepers and police to one southern town Friday night after supporters of presidential candidate Michel Martelly clashed with members of the outgoing president's political party. Last week, U.N. Peacekeepers lost control of the streets of Haiti's second largest city, after a deadly cholera outbreak triggered violent protests. Haitian authorities aren't taking any chances. They're imposing strict curfews on vehicle traffic on election day, banning the sale of alcohol, and suspending licenses for guns until three days after the vote. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . APRIL WILLIAMS, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for a Shoutout! What is the Monday after Thanksgiving weekend known as? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Leftover Monday, B) Online Monday, C) Cyber Monday or D) Manic Monday? You've got three seconds -- GO! Many stores see Cyber Monday as the beginning of the online shopping season for the holidays! That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! More Hype than Sales? AZUZ: That means today, millions of Americans will be shopping online; many of them are going to be at work when they do. Consumer Reports says that 17 percent of adult Americans will be surfing for internet deals today, while 13 percent are expected to actually set foot in a store. So you can see the difference between Cyber Monday, and Black Friday, which was last week. Retailers were hoping to get in the black, meaning they'd be making profits, but this time around, it looks like Black Friday was more hype than sales. The crowds were bigger overall. But the actual increase in Black Friday sales was only slight. In fact, it was about the same increase over last year as last year was over the year before. Football Concussions . AZUZ: CNN recently interviewed Fred McNeill. He's a former Minnesota Vikings linebacker who clearly remembers one of the big plays he made in Super Bowl 11. That was back in 1977. But if you were  to ask McNeill where he was yesterday and whom he just met, the 58-year-old has trouble remembering. Doctor Sanjay Gupta interviews another football player and tells us what could be the reasons why for these memory issues. (BEGIN VIDEO) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Do you feel like now, in retrospect, you ever stayed in the game or was sort of pushed to stay in the game when you shouldn't have? KURT WARNER, FORMER NFL QUARTERBACK: Yes, there's no question that's happened. A lot of guys when they get those hits or those concussions, they think, ""OK, I'm just going to play through it here for the short-term and it's going to get better."" UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: He was just lifted up and deposited - . GUPTA: Playing through it is part of football says Warner. A big part. WARNER: Probably 100 percent of the guys that played my sport in the NFL have been there. And I think for a long time it was felt like, well, if you didn't get up dizzy or with no memory, then you really didn't suffer a concussion. GUPTA: What does a concussion feel like? WARNER: It's like a mental fogginess, where you almost seem like you're separated from the situation. You're in it, but you're kind of looking at it from the outside looking in. GUSKIEWICZ: How many of you have -- by show of hands - had a concussion? GUPTA: Kevin Guskiewicz, formerly a Pittsburgh Steelers trainer, studies concussions' impact on the brain in high school players. KEVIN GUSKIEWICZ, BRAIN INJURY RESEARCHER, FORMER NFL TRAINER: This is showing moderate levels of atrophy. GUPTA: And retired NFL athletes. In his study, players who've had three or more concussions get MRIs. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm going to say three words. GUPTA: And memory tests. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Apple, penny, table. Now you say those. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Apple, penny, table. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good. GUPTA: Memory problems are not the only thing they are finding. GUSKIEWICZ: The brain has shrunk. GUPTA: Concussions may be shrinking memory and learning centers in the brain, thwarting its ability to transmit signals. (END VIDEO) AZUZ: We asked the NFL about Kurt Warner's statement about players staying in the game even if they are hurt. The organization's response: ""If anything, we are going in the other direction where people sit out until they are totally symptom-free. There are so many protocols now, if a guy gets pulled out in a game, he cannot go back until he's cleared by the team doctor."" Before We Go . AZUZ: 'Tis the season when you see members of the Salvation Army, ringing bells outside stores. They don't have to be human. Here's Tinker, a miniature horse who's harnessed the heart of the holidays. His owner says she saw too many people passing by the kettle without making donations. So with a little training, Tinker rings a bell and brings money to the pan! Goodbye . AZUZ: Silencing all the neigh-sayers. Hey, Tinker may be a little guy, but he's still a stud. We're riding out -- I'm Carl Azuz for CNN Student News and we'll see you tomorrow.","North Korea voices anger and threats over international military exercises .

"In Subject Matters, we reveal the struggles faced by educators who teach subjects like science, math, English and history, and the solutions they've found. Teachers, share more ideas in our weekly Teachers' Lounge. As science teachers try to educate the next generation of scientists in the United States, they worry about everything from a shortage of supplies for classroom experiments to their subject's nerdy image. Here are some of the challenges they face in their classrooms. Pencils, paper ... and Alka-Seltzer? Eighth-graders love rockets. Science teacher Jennifer Judkins of Wilmington, Massachusetts, makes sure that her students build and launch small rockets as part of her curriculum. ""It's a great activity for our laws-of-motion study,"" the Wilmington Middle School teacher said. ""Just hearing the students talk among themselves about which rocket will go higher, seeing that learning happening right in front of you, is impactful."" This activity has a cost for Judkins -- $30 to be exact. That's how much she recently spent on Alka-Seltzer tablets and film canisters to make 100 rockets. ""Sure, I could read in a book and say, 'If you launch a rocket, this will happen,' but they aren't going to take that with them,"" she said. For science teachers, piquing students' curiosity starts with experiments. But those experiments require raw materials, and many public schools have cut budgets for frogs and owl pellets. Holly Gildig, who teaches sixth-grade science in rural Livingston, Louisiana, said she has difficulty acquiring materials needed to do experiments with her class. She also uses her own money to purchase materials needed for her classroom, or she sends a note home to parents to see if they can help. But even that won't help her greatest need: A place to do experiments, or at least a sink in the classroom. ""I don't have a lab that I can take my students to,"" Gildig said. ""I really don't have the equipment to teach science."" When she can't come up with the raw materials she needs, she goes online. ""Sometimes, I just have to go with technology and find something online and present it to the kids that way,"" she said. Science isn't just for geeks . Before Teresa Marshall became a high school science teacher, she worked as a chemist. Her students are every bit as intelligent as the scientists that she worked with, she said, but the kids will never believe it. ""A lot of kids come to chemistry class believing that they aren't good at science,"" said Marshall, who teaches in Wilmington, Massachusetts. ""They label themselves as being not good at science."" Adrianna Dupre, a chemistry teacher at Terrebonne High School in Houma, Louisiana, said most of her students say they don't like science at the start of the school year. ""They think we are just teaching them stuff to make their lives miserable,"" Dupre said. But as the year progresses, she connects her lessons to real life, like relating combustion to starting a car. Soon enough, the students' arguments become less pronounced. Students who believe they can't do well in science may never have had a teacher that engaged them on the topic, said Janice Earle of the National Science Foundation. ""There is often a problem in the parents' perceptions, since their experience back in school days may have been with science classes that they experienced as being boring or focused on memorization, rather than active learning,"" Earle said. ""They may pass on to their kids the sense that science is a boring pastime for nerds, rather than an interesting, collaborative enterprise that's all about observing and understanding the world around you."" All science is not equal . Kids in elementary school are focusing on English and math to keep in line with standards set by No Child Left Behind. Their teachers are likely to have studied elementary education, but few will have a background in science. That means kids may not be getting the early background in science that they need. ""The elementary teacher in general does not have deep background in science,"" said Francis Eberle, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association. ""Their understanding and their ability to help students learn science is more challenged because they don't really know science themselves."" There has been a decline in the time that elementary teachers spend on science over the past six years under the No Child Left Behind law, Eberle said. ""It's hard when an elementary schedule is math- and reading-based, with little time devoted to science,"" said Jay Farnsworth, a sixth-grade teacher in Waunakee, Wisconsin. By the time students get to middle and high school, they're more likely to be taught by a teacher with a degree in science. But the teachers' degree may not be in the discipline they are teaching. Long before Judkins was teaching classes to build rockets, she was a biologist for NASA. Earth science was part of her curriculum, but she had no experience on the topic. Her solution? She took a workshop and did her own research about the best ways to teach the topic. All of it was at her own expense.","Science teachers struggle with a lack of materials for experiments .
Some students have a hard time believing they'll be good at science .
Administrators often ask teachers to work with subject matter they're not familiar with .
Math and English education are emphasized, while science is left behind, teachers say ."
"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan lawmakers Sunday offered a new proposal to end a political standoff with President Hamid Karzai over complaints from the losers of September's parliamentary vote . Karzai is refusing to swear in the new parliament until an electoral court he established in December can review complaints from losing candidates. He has refused two previous calls by lawmakers to dissolve that body, which members of the National Assembly say is unconstitutional. The latest proposal, floated by lawmakers on Sunday, says criminal cases stemming from the election will be prosecuted based on Afghanistan's constitution and election laws and that members of parliament would retain their immunity. It drops references to a ""special court,"" however. No decision from Karzai's office was expected until Monday, said one of the lawmakers, Nahid Ahmadi. Karzai's office has not returned repeated calls from CNN for comment. Karzai's office on Wednesday announced a one-month delay in inaugurating parliament, saying that the special court on election fraud needed more time to investigate complaints from losing candidates. The decision drew criticism from the U.N. mission in Afghanistan and concern from analysts that it could spark ethnic divisions and more violence. Afghanistan's existing electoral bodies, the Independent Electoral Commission and Election Complaint Commission, have reviewed the results of last year's election. In November, the Electoral Complaint Commission threw out more than 1 million ballots from around 3,000 polling stations because of suspected fraud. The decision resulted in losses for candidates from Karzai's power base in the largely Pashtun south, where much of the fighting between Taliban guerrillas and NATO and Afghan troops is taking place. The losing candidates argue that their  constituents were unable to vote because of violence and intimidation, and that Pashtuns will feel increasingly alienated from the government and turn back to the Taliban. ""The most important thing that is being ignored in these legalistic discussions and political maneuvers is the people of this country. Where do they fit in? Where do they belong?"" said Daud Sultanzai, one of about 250 losing candidates who are scheduled to meet with Karzai this week. In Sultanzai's home province of Ghazni, all 11 parliament seats went to the province's Hazara minority. In one district, only 3 people out of 100,000 cast their ballots. He blamed forces outside the country for pushing ordinary Afghans ""into this corner."" ""We are the people of this country,"" Sultanzai said. ""Everyone is interfering -- embassies, warlords, drug lords. They are all stepping on the people of this country. We want a voice in this country."" Karzai, whose own 2009 re-election was marred by allegations of widespread fraud, appeared to concede to lawmakers' demands on Saturday and offered to convene parliament on Wednesday. But under his offer, the inauguration would take place only if lawmakers accept any decision made by the special court, lawmaker Baktash Siawash said Saturday. Lawmakers countered Karzai by asking him to dissolve the special court and have the nation's Supreme Court investigate the cases. Karzai also rejected that proposal. CNN's Arwa Damon and Mati Matiullah contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawmakers make new offer to end impasse with Karzai .

"(CNN) -- An armed man hijacked a Greyhound bus Thursday in North Carolina and took the passengers on a short, wild ride before being arrested. The bus was traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, when the gun-toting passenger approached the driver Thursday night, said Maureen Richmond, a Greyhound spokeswoman. The passenger screamed for the driver to pull over. The driver did. Thirty-three of passengers were allowed to get off the bus at that time, according to Vance County Sheriff Peter White. The driver, the gunman and the two remaining passengers then continued on to a nearby gas station where police were waiting. The suspect, identified as Jose Flores, was shocked with a stun gun and then arrested, said White. Flores faces a charge of one count of kidnapping, said Capt.

"(CNN) -- Police in three European countries were looking Sunday for 6-year-old twin girls abducted by their father, who was found dead last week. Interpol issued an international Yellow Notice missing persons alert Saturday for Alessia and Livia Schepp. Such notices are distributed to police in Interpol's 188 member countries to help find missing people, especially children. The Schepp sisters were reported missing January 30 after their father, Matthias, took them from their home in St. Sulpice, near Lausanne in western Switzerland, Interpol said. He took the girls following personal problems at home, according to the state police in Vaud, which covers the area of St. Sulpice. State police said Schepp drove through Marseilles, France, on Tuesday. Two days later, police in Bari, Italy, found the father's body, but there was no sign of the girls. A spokesman for the Vaud state police said the investigation is focused on Switzerland, France and Italy. Both girls are blonde and about 3 feet, 9 inches tall, Interpol said. When they were taken, Livia was wearing a green T-shirt, jeans, a violet ski jacket, and Adidas sneakers. Alessia was wearing a T-shirt with red and white stripes, jeans, a brown jacket, and black shoes.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: What do the Statue of Liberty, a flying car and James Bond have in common? You're gonna find out in the next 10 minutes. My name is Carl Azuz. Welcome to CNN Student News. Let's go ahead and get you today's headlines. First Up: Midwest Storms . AZUZ: All right, the wind and the rain are slowing down; now, it's time to start cleaning up. That is what is happening all over the United States after this week's tremendous storms. Maybe your town got hit by this severe weather. It is not alone. Check out this map of the United States. If you start over in New York on the East Coast, you go to Wisconsin in the Midwest, then down the Gulf Coast. There was damage across parts of that entire area. Three states -- Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky -- seemed to get the worst of this. And besides the physical damage, hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed over the past couple days. John Roberts wraps up some of the impact of these storms. (BEGIN VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's that rare of an event. JOHN ROBERTS, CNN ANCHOR: Everyone has a storm they'll talk about for the rest of their lives. For many folks from the Dakotas down through the south, this was it, their hurricane, their nor'easter. It even had a name: the ""Chi-clone."" UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It sounds just like a train, like they say it does. And as fast as it came is as fast as it went. ROBERTS: A historic storm stretching a staggering 1,200 miles from north to south that had it all: hurricane-force winds, monsoon-like rain, blizzard warnings and tornadoes reported in at least seven states. This surveillance camera kept rolling inside one possible twister in Indiana as the tin roof came off a barn and a boat went airborne. Trees snapped and crushed cars in Kentucky. A rogue gust of wind tipped over a semi and tore off its roof in Michigan. And in Ohio, someone came home to find only half their house was there. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We were at work, got a phone call that you better get out to your house, the roof's gone off of it. And I said, ""Yeah, right."" ROBERTS: Now, the dangerous storm is moving on. But thousands of fliers aren't, as grounded airlines struggle to catch up. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have to leave today. (END VIDEO) Haiti Cholera Outbreak . AZUZ: A health official says it could take months to get an outbreak of cholera under control in Haiti. Cholera is a disease that's caused by a bacterial infection. Most people get it from contaminated food or water. This official says Haiti can expect to see cases of cholera for years. Right now, the outbreak is getting worse. More than 4,000 people have confirmed cases of the disease. Nearly 300 others have died so far. Aid workers are trying to slow down the spread of cholera by going into Haitian camps and teaching people about proper water and waste treatment. Many Haitians are living in these camps because their homes were destroyed by the earthquake earlier this year. What's the Word . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? any kind of animal that has a backbone . VERTEBRATE . That's the word! Endangered Vertebrates . AZUZ: When we talk about vertebrates, it includes mammals, birds, amphibians. There's a new study out called the Red List that says that one-fifth of these animals -- 20 percent! -- are at risk of going extinct. Amphibians like this frog are in the most danger. According to the Red List, over 40 percent of them are closer to extinction than we thought. Scientists say habitat loss is partly to blame here. When land changes --- cutting down trees, for example --animals that lived there might not be able to survive. There is some good news in the report, though. Experts say that the situation could have been worse if it weren't for conservation efforts to save some of these species. Focus on Bullying . AZUZ: We got more than a thousand comments the last time we blogged about bullying. And you aren't the only ones talking about this issue. A new study out -- just came out this week -- is all about bullying. It says around half of all students admit to being bullied, and the same number admit to being bullies. President Obama's addressing this. His administration is putting out new guidelines that say schools should face penalties if they don't address certain kinds of bullying. Some critics argue that the government is overreacting with these new guidelines. And one expert says parents need to be part of this situation by talking to their kids and looking for signs of bullying. This Day in History . [ON SCREEN GRAPHIC] .

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Sauve's social studies classes at Shell Lake Junior/Senior High in Shell Lake, Wisconsin! What U.S. government agency regulates air travel? Is it the: A) FEC, B) FBI, C) NASA or D) FAA? Start the countdown at three seconds -- GO! That's the job of the FAA, or Federal Aviation Administration. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Flying Car . AZUZ: Part of the FAA's job is to approve new vehicles. The agency decides if they're airworthy. Recently, it signed off on the Maverick. This is a new design that answers the question: When is a plane not a plane? Kate Bolduan took this one out: not for a test flight; for a test drive. Take a look at her report. (BEGIN VIDEO) KATE BOLDUAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We've all dreamed of a flying car. But this man, Florida missionary Steve Saint... STEVE SAINT, I-TEC: We could probably get you flying this by noon. BOLDUAN: Really? SAINT: Really. BOLDUAN: ...He's making it a reality. SAINT: Anybody who's ever been in a traffic jam, anybody who's ever been some place where, you know, trying to get out of the parking lot at Disney, has thought about, you know, if I could just fly. And this one will. BOLDUAN: It's called the Maverick. Last year, Popular Mechanics gave the prototype one of its breathrough awards of the year. LOGAN WARD, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, POPULAR MECHANICS: The Maverick is not only a practical flying car, but it's also a beefy car. They put a Subaru engine in this thing, 250 horsepower. It goes 0-60 in 3.9 seconds. BOLDUAN: By air, it glides at 40 miles per hour. It's the first of its kind to get FAA approval. The Maverick's biggest success: it's intuitive. SAINT: For driving, you have a steering wheel and you have a brake and accelerator, just like an automatic car. BOLDUAN: Just like a car. SAINT: Which you probably have. BOLDUAN: Yep. SAINT: Now, when you're going to fly, you see this one little button that says fly? BOLDUAN: Yes. SAINT: All you do to fly is you flip this up. BOLDUAN: What is the biggest selling point of the Maverick versus another type of hybrid machine? SAINT: There is no other machine that will do what this one will. There is no other car that will fly and go on water and go on snow. BOLDUAN: Saint and his crew at I-Tec, a non-profit organization, developed the Maverick in part to solve a transportation riddle for frontier areas like the Amazon in Ecuador, where Saint grew up. What do you do when the road ends? Now, he says, the practical applications of their machine reach far beyond jungle survival. SAINT: You can fly over, find somebody who needs to be rescued, and you can land and then drive to them. So, that would be another one. Border patrol, pipeline monitoring, ranching and extreme sports. There's just all kinds of uses. I'm sure we'll be surprised by the uses that people put this to. BOLDUAN: The next step: commercial production. For $80,000, a flying car could be coming soon to a garage near you. Kate Bolduan, CNN, Dunnellon, Florida. (END VIDEO) Facebook Chat Promo .

This is the Aston Martin that was used in two James Bond movies. What's cool about this is that some of the gadgets from the films actually work on the car. It's got a bullet shield; it's got a revolving license plate, an ejection seat. Okay, not really the ejection seat; that doesn't actually work. But the car is going up for auction this week. Experts think it could pull in -- get this -- 5 million dollars. Goodbye . AZUZ: Seems a bit high, but I guess you can't put a price on bonding with 007.

"(CNN) -- The Super Bowl may be the most watched television event in the United States, but that won't be the primary focus for millions of people tuning in this year. Stephen Master, vice president of Nielsen Sports media research, told CNNMoney.com that close to 50 percent of viewers actually watch the commercials more than they watch the game. This doesn't surprise 24-year-old Chantal Paradis of Austin, Texas, who is among the TV followers who care more about the ads and less about the Green Bay Packers-Pittsburgh Steelers matchup. See a sneak peak of this year's ads . ""I plan to record the Super Bowl before I start watching it so I can fast-forward to the commercials,"" Paradis said. ""I really don't care who wins the game."" Twenty-five-year-old Carmelo Giangrande of Crystal Lake, Illinois, says he only watches the ads, too, and couldn't care less about football. He prefers to watch ice hockey. ""I like how the Super Bowl brings people together for parties, but I think the advertisements are more interesting than the game,"" Giangrande noted. ""I'll eat, drink and socialize during the Super Bowl, then tune in when the commercials air,"" he said. That's good news for companies paying the reported $100,000-per-second ad rate to showcase their products on Fox this year. Although 106.5 million people tuned into last year's Super Bowl, it's the buzz before, during and after the game about an ad that advertisers really care about. Paradis, a married insurance sales professional, says she'll be on the lookout for commercials that make her laugh. ""I think the most memorable Super Bowl commercials are the funny ones,"" she said. ""I'm a big fan of Justin Timberlake, so I liked the one with him in the Pepsi ad a few years ago where he was playfully beat up."" Giangrande says he enjoys the beer ads and prefers commercials that make him laugh, too. Mainstream media outlets and social media sites devote space and time to highlight the spots, too, which can add to the excitement and build up this pop culture phenomenon. Both Paradis and Giangrande are among the growing number of members of Facebook fan pages dedicated to Super Bowl commercials. ""It's almost become a sort of holiday or an American tradition to watch the ads,"" she said. Viewers interested in the ads this year will get to view a variety of spots featuring beer, soda, cars -- and celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber and Ozzy Osbourne, to name a few.","Report: Close to 50 percent of Super Bowl viewers watch the commercials more than game .

SHANELL: And we're from Colby, Kansas. AMANDA: And this is Carl Azuz with today's CNN Student News! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Very nicely done, ladies, getting us off to a galloping start. That was awesome, just like Fridays! Wonder if those horses were neighbors. Whether you live next door or halfway around the world, we welcome all of our viewers to CNN Student News. First Up: Roof Collapse . AZUZ: So, let's say you're a Steelers or Packers fan. You're heading to the Super Bowl in Dallas, Texas to get away from the cold weather in your hometown. But when you show up in Texas, the wind chill is 10 degrees below zero! Believe that! That's what it felt like in Dallas yesterday. Throw in several inches of snow and ice, parts of the city just shut down. One Packers player said it was funny to see everything closed. He said in Green Bay, this would've been a normal day. What we're about to show you, though, is not normal. Watch this. That's the power of this snowstorm. The roof of the building in Massachusetts completely collapsed under the weight of all the snow. Luckily, everyone who was inside got out safely ahead of time. Prayer Breakfast . AZUZ: The National Prayer Breakfast has taken place in Washington, D.C. every year for nearly six decades. During yesterday's prayer breakfast, President Obama gave a very personal speech about his religious faith. He talked about how his faith sustains him and how he asks God for strength. The president wasn't the only speaker at the event. U.S. astronaut Mark Kelly -- he is the husband of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- gave the closing prayer. He also talked about his wife's recovery from a shooting attack in Arizona. The president also talked about violence that's taking place in a different part of the world. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We pray that the violence in Egypt will end, and that the rights and aspirations of the Egyptian people will be realized. And that a better day will dawn over Egypt and throughout the world. Egypt Unrest & Social Media . AZUZ: People who support and people who are against Egypt's government continued to fight against each other in the country's capital of Cairo on Thursday, though the fighting wasn't as intense as it was the day before. In an interview with Christiane Amanpour of ABC News, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who's the main focus of these protests, said he was very unhappy about the fighting. He also said that he would leave office right away, but that he didn't want to risk plunging his nation into chaos. Political protests certainly aren't a new idea. They've been happening for centuries. But as Karen Caifa explains for us now, there is a very modern twist to these protests in Egypt. (BEGIN VIDEO) KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Pictures that speak a thousand words. Protests fueled by 140 characters. The unrest in Egypt targets the 30-year tenure of leader Hosni Mubarak, protests led by a generation that's come of age and found their voice in the era of social media. NASSER WEDDADY, AMERICAN ISLAMIC CONGRESS: You have a generation right now, an entire generation that was born under the Mubarak rule, that has taken to the streets and they want him out. CAIFA: While the percentage of Egyptians engaging in social media is small compared to that in the United States, like young Americans, it's young Egyptians making the most use of it. So before they took to the streets, they took to Twitter and to Facebook to mobilize, organize, to share their anger with each other and with the world. But at points during the height of the unrest, those tools went dark, with reports of the Egyptian government cracking down on Twitter and Facebook use, and cutting off internet access. A move criticized by the White House. ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We believe that the people of Egypt have a right to freedom of expression and freedom of speech, and that includes the use of the internet. CAIFA: And even with postings from within Egypt limited, the events stayed among the top trending topics on Twitter, piquing the interest of social media users worldwide using a number of hashtags. WEDDADY: The demonstrations that you're seeing right now in the streets, that's an example of online activism going back into the real world. (END VIDEO) Health Care Debate . AZUZ: An effort to overturn the controversial Health Care Reform Law will not be moving forward in the U.S. Senate. Senate Democrats blocked the move by Senate Republicans on Wednesday in a 51-to-47 vote that was right down party lines. Two Democratic senators didn't vote. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted to overturn the law last month. But with the Senate vote on Wednesday, this debate may be over in Congress. But it's not over in the courts. Earlier this week, a federal judge in Florida ruled that the health care law is unconstitutional. Another judge has ruled the same way. But two other federal judges have said the opposite. All this, what this means, this will probably end up in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. So there's a good chance we haven't heard the end of this health reform law debate. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Linser's social studies classes at Bellevue High School in Bellevue, Washington! On the Chinese calendar, what year has just begun? You know what to do! Is it the Year of the... A) Rabbit, B) Ox, C) Snake or D) Tiger? You've got three seconds -- GO!  The Chinese calendar has just kicked off the Year of the Rabbit. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Chinese New Year . AZUZ: All right. The Chinese calendar is lunar; it's based on the moon. And in a 12-year cycle, every year is assigned a different animal from ancient times. Astrologers describe the rabbit as kind and gentle, so maybe this will be a year of calm in China. Who knows? One thing we do know. These Year of the Rabbit celebrations are hopping, and they're going to go on for two weeks. The new year kicks off a fifteen-day Spring festival. There are parades, like this one. A lot of fireworks and festivities. And we're not just talking about things that happened in China. These celebrations happen in cities all around the world. Digital Dating Abuse . AZUZ: There was a time, when you wanted to ask someone out, you'd pass them a note that said ""Do you want to go out with me? Check yes or no."" And you'd really, really hope she didn't say maybe. These days, dating, of course, as you know, is a lot more high-tech. But the technology can also be used in harmful ways. We have a report now about some of the potential problems of dating in a digital world. (BEGIN VIDEO) CINDY SOUTHWORTH, NATIONAL NETWORK TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: What else makes digital dating abuse, do you think? CAIFA: Inside this classroom at Jefferson Middle School in Washington, D.C., lessons about the technology that connects teens, but also brings new challenges. Many parents are aware of cyberbullying. But others may not know the signs of digital dating abuse. And a recent survey found that more than half of teens know someone who's been a victim. PATRICIA PRIDE, JEFFERSON MIDDLE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL: A lot of the things that happen on Facebook, on MySpace, on the social networks on the weekends, we see filter into the school on Monday morning. CAIFA: Digital dating abuse includes things like excessive or harassing text messages or emails, accessing or manipulating a boyfriend or girlfriend's Facebook or MySpace page, or ""sexting"" with racy photos, all by simply using a mobile phone. SOUTHWORTH: It doesn't necessarily cause dating abuse. You can take the phone away and there's still going to be a controlling relationship, but it's definitely playing out through the technology. CAIFA: So, ""Love is Not Abuse,"" a nationwide coalition that teaches teens about the dangers of domestic violence, now has a bigger focus on the role of the internet and social networking, during and after a relationship. SOUTHWORTH: You're texting a lot, and it's a good thing and both people are happy. But what if you try to break up and the texting keeps happening? CAIFA: The students here were the first to take part in the new curriculum, a kickoff to February's National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. It will soon roll out across the country, a campaign to help students understand that abuse is real, even if it's in the digital realm. In Washington, I'm Karin Caifa for CNN Student News.

Fearless flyers are strapped onto safety lines at all times. And in truth, you're zipping along about 50 feet over the reptiles' reach. Goodbye .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- After more than seven months of political gridlock, Nepal's parliament Thursday elected a 60-year-old leftist leader as the country's new prime minister. Jhala Nath Khanal, chairman of the leftist Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), received 368 votes in the 601-member parliament. His nearest rival, Ram Chandra Poudel of the Nepali Congress, got 122 votes and Bijay Kumar Gachhedar of Madhesi People's Rights Forum (Democratic) got 67 votes. Before the vote, Khanal said in parliament that resolving the political complexities of the country would be his first priority. Khanal faces the challenge of preparing -- with the support of other parties -- a new republican constitution by a May 28 deadline and finalizing an agreement on the future of nearly 20,000 Maoist combatants. The country had been without a proper government since outgoing and caretaker prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal resigned in June. Sixteen rounds of voting in parliament since July failed to produce a prime minister since none of the parties had a majority. Nepal's biggest party, the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), decided to withdraw its own candidate earlier Thursday and back Khanal. He becomes the third prime minister since Nepal became a republic in 2008, ending centuries of monarchy rule. He replaces Nepal, who was also of the same party but had the support of Nepali Congress, the second biggest party in parliament. The Maoists fought a 10-year insurgency to end the monarchy and signed a peace deal in 2006 in which the combatants were to be integrated into the security forces, but the exact process of how that will be accomplished has yet to be agreed upon between the parties. The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu congratulated the people of Nepal on the election. ""We look forward to working with incoming Prime Minister Khanal and continuing the warm and constructive relationship between the United States and Nepal,"" a statement from the embassy said.  ""We are hopeful that today's election will give renewed momentum to the peace process and constitution drafting."" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also praised the election, according to a spokesman. ""He congratulates the Prime Minister-elect and reaffirms the support of the United Nations to all efforts to complete the peace process and to adopt a new constitution,"" a statement from Ban's spokesman said.  ""He believes this development will give a significant boost to efforts to fully implement their outstanding commitments under the Comprehensive Peace Accord and the interim constitution, notably the integration and rehabilitation of the Maoist combatants, democratization of the army and adoption of a new constitution."" Earlier Thursday, Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' withdrew his candidacy for the prime minister race, saying that his party would concentrate on the constitution and the future of the combatants. He said he realized he was not going to win and the country needed a proper government. ""There is a need for sacrifice to resolve the problems,"" Dahal said. ""The Maoists, since it is the biggest party, should take this responsibility."" The communist leader said that if parliament could not elect a prime minister again, people would throw shoes at the politicians -- a high insult in certain cultures. There has been widespread discontent among the Nepalese about the political stalemate. Last month, prime minister-elect Khanal was slapped in the face by 52-year-old man at a political rally, who accused the politicians of being selfish. Nepal's political crisis began when Dahal resigned as prime minister in May 2009 after the ceremonial president, who is the supreme commander of the army, reinstated the army chief Dahal had fired.","NEW:  U.S., U.N. praise the election of the prime minister .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- For the first time sumo wrestling's governing body can recall, one of its revered athletes has been nabbed for drug possession. Fans expect dignity from their sumo wrestlers, so the drug arrest has stunned Japan. Police arrested 335-pound Soslan Aleksandrovich Gagloev -- better known as Wakanoho -- on Monday. They say they found a third of a gram of marijuana in his wallet. That's enough to land him in prison on a diet of forced labor for five years if he's convicted. It's the latest black eye for a sport closely intwined with Japanese culture and history. Fans have long expected humility and dignity from their sumo wrestlers, so the drug arrest has stunned people in Japan, where the national sport has taken a beating in the last year or so. First, police charged three sumo wrestlers and their stable master with beating a teenage sumo to death last year. They deny it. Then Japan's top sumo -- Asashoryu -- apologized on national TV after being caught in an apparent lie. He pulled out of an exhibition tournament, saying he was hurt. But television cameras caught him playing soccer in his native Mongolia days later, apparently without injury. The Japan Sumo Association suspended Asashoryu -- the first time the country's yokozuna , or top sumo, has received that punishment. Now comes the drug arrest. Police say they found marijuana in Wakanoho's wallet on June 24 and arrested him Monday after an investigation. The 20-year-old Russian wrester, who stands six feet four inches, has not entered a plea, authorities said. But the arrest prompted the Japan Sumo Association to apologize to fans and pledge to investigate. Sumo wrestling, which traces it roots back 1,500 years, is struggling not just within its ranks, but in popularity, as well. Fewer Japanese boys are entering the tough life of sumo, so the Sumo Association is recruiting foreigners like Wakanoho and Asashoryu. Attendance is down at the stadiums, as more Japanese embrace soccer and baseball. All these struggles may have a silver lining. ""These allegations, be they true or false, this one included, they're all turning points to a more open sumo,"" says Mark Buckton, a sumo analyst for the Japan Times. ""It's good for the sport in the end. It can open up the sport, make them follow modern society.""","First ever sumo wrestler held for drug possession .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League strugglers West Bromwich Albion have sacked manager Roberto di Matteo following a poor run of recent results. The 40-year-old former Italian international led Albion to promotion from the Championship last season, his first at the club. And they continued that good form into the start of the current campaign, notably winning 3-2 at Arsenal and earning a 2-2 draw at Manchester United -- the only team to avoid defeat at Old Trafford this season. Their start to the season was so impressive that Di Matteo won the Premier League Manager of the Month award for September. However, results have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks, and di Matteo was relieved of his duties following Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City which left them just one place above the relegation zone in 16th place. A statement on the official club website read: ""West Bromwich Albion have relieved head coach Roberto di Matteo of his duties with immediate effect. ""This was the unanimous decision of the football club's board of directors in light of a worrying sequence of results which has seen the club lose 13 of their last 18 games in all competitions, winning only three. ""First-team coach Michael Appleton will assume control of first-team affairs whilst the club considers all available options for a new head coach."" Club chairman Jeremy Peace added: ""This has been a tough decision, but we, as a board, believe it is the right one to give the club the best possible chance of remaining in the Premier League this decision.""","West Bromwich Albion have sacked manager Roberto di Matteo with immediate effect .

"London (CNN) -- The hijacking of a U.S.-bound oil tanker carrying 2 million barrels of crude on Wednesday marks what one shipping official calls ""significant shift in the impact of the piracy crisis,"" with major oil lines to the West under severe threat. Pirates seized the MV Irene SL, a Greek supertanker, in the afternoon -- marking the second such incident in two days. They occurred in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean where hijacking have become commonplace in recent years. The European Union Naval Force said the Irene departed Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates and was destined for the Egyptian port of Suez in the North Arabian Sea when it was attacked. But the force doesn't always report the final destination. Joe Angelo, managing director of the trade association INTERTANKO, citing the owner, Enesel S.A., said the ship was ultimately headed for the U.S. gulf. ""The hijacking by pirates of 2 million barrels of Kuwaiti crude oil destined for the U.S. in a large Greek tanker in the middle of the main sea lanes coming from the Middle East Gulf marks a significant shift in the impact of the piracy crisis in the Indian Ocean,"" Angelo told CNN. ""If piracy in the Indian Ocean is left unabated, it will strangle these crucial shipping lanes with the potential to severely disrupt oil flows to the U.S. and to the rest of the world."" The Wednesday incident took place about 350 nautical miles southeast of the Omani city of Muscat in the North Arabian Sea. The crew consists of 17 Filipinos, seven Greeks, and a Georgian. A Greek Merchant Marine Ministry spokesman said the ship was carrying 266,000 tons of crude oil. There has been no communication with the ship, officials from Greece and the European Union Naval Force said. On Tuesday, the MV Savina Caylyn, an Italian-flagged oil tanker, was headed from Sudan to Malaysia when five people on a skiff launched a ""sustained attack"" on the tanker with small arms and rocket propelled grenades and then got on the ship. The naval force also said on Wednesday it received reports that the Golden Wave, a South Korean fishing vessel seized in October off the Kenyan coast, has been released from pirate control. The condition of the 43 crew members are not known, but the naval force says ""they are in need of food, water and medical aid.""

"(CNN) -- Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, who has been living in exile in South Africa for seven years, has been issued a new passport to return home, the Haitian interior minister said Wednesday. Paul-Antoine Bien-Aime said the diplomatic passport was handed over to Aristide's U.S. attorney Ira Kurzban, who picked it up in Port-au-Prince Tuesday evening. That removes a major obstacle that has prevented Aristide from making the journey back. However, Kurzban said last month that Aristide would still need the cooperation of South Africa and the United States to make the journey home. Kurzban also said last month that Aristide had no intention of re-entering politics. But Washington has already signaled its displeasure. ""We do not doubt President Aristide's desire to help the people of Haiti. But today Haiti needs to focus on its future, not its past,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said last month. ""This is an important period for Haiti. What it needs is calm, not divisive actions that distract from the task of forming a new government."" The former Roman Catholic priest, who became a voice for Haiti's impoverished, remains a polarizing figure but commands a large following in his homeland. Jacob Francois, coordinator for Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party in the United States, predicted crowds would greet Aristide upon his return. ""It will be the greatest party of this decade,"" Francois said. ""Once again the world will see that President Aristide is the most revered politician in the history of Haiti."" Aristide left Haiti on a U.S. jet in 2004 after a bloody revolt by street gangs and soldiers. The leftist former president says he was shuttled out by Western powers. Aristide has long expressed his desire to go home. He reiterated that wish just days after former dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier returned to Haiti in January. ""Once again I express my readiness to leave today, tomorrow, at any time,"" Aristide said in a January statement. ""The people of Haiti have never stopped calling for my return to Haiti."" His return would come at crucial time in Haiti's history. The Caribbean nation's efforts to recover from a devastating 2010 earthquake has been compounded by a cholera epidemic and political chaos sparked by allegations of fraud in the presidential elections held in late November. A runoff is scheduled in March and a winner will not be known until April.","NEW: Interior minister says the passport was given to Aristide's lawyer .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Bomb blasts in Pakistan rocked three police buildings near Lahore, police told CNN on Wednesday. Police chief Ghulam Mehmood Dogar said the three bombs were planted on Tuesday night at a police station, an office of a senior police official and a police barracks. They were detonated by remote control this morning in the city of Gujranwala, 70 kilometers northwest of Lahore, Dogar said. Three police officers were injured and parts of the buildings were damaged. The first two explosions happened within 30 minutes of one another, and the third bomb was detonated about three hours later. Gujranwala has been largely free of the militant violence plaguing parts of Pakistan. Police said there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against suspected serial strangler Antonio Rodriguez, according to District Attorney spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson. Rodriguez appeared at a preliminary hearing Wednesday where two police detectives read confessions Rodriguez gave regarding three women he allegedly killed and sexually assaulted between November and December of last year, according to Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Bretschneider. Nicknamed the Kensington strangler, the 21-year-old Rodriguez was arrested after DNA testing linked him to the attacks in the city's Kensington district, according to Detective Justin Frank. ""We're hopeful that this will put an end to this,"" Frank said. Rodriguez is suspected of killing Casey Mahoney, 27; Elaine Goldberg, 21; and Nicole Piacentini, 35. Police Capt. James J.

"(CNN) -- A lot gets carried in a plane's cargo hold, but US Airways is still against people, especially those still on the clock. A baggage handler at Reagan National Airport in Washington was found locked in a US Airways plane's cargo hold before takeoff Monday, said Laura J. Brown with the Federal Aviation Administration. Employees were searching for their co-worker when banging was heard outside the fuselage, she said. While loading a departing flight, the employee watched from inside the cargo hold as a co-worker closed the forward bin door from outside. According to the FAA, within ""a matter of minutes,"" a third employee arrived and questioned where the baggage handler was, because the handler also was expected to tug the plane away from the gate. Upon opening his window, the first officer reportedly heard banging coming from inside the plane. The worker was released and went on to operate the tug. The plane departed ahead of schedule. Republic Airlines Flight 3336, listed as a US Airways flight, had 29 passengers on board and very few checked bags, Brown said. Liz Landau, a spokeswoman for US Airways said, ""The engines never started and (the plane) never left the gate."" It is not uncommon for baggage handlers to enter a cargo hold as part of their job, Landau said. An investigation by US Airways is under way.

"(CNN) -- A Polaroid picture of the late Dennis Hopper was stolen from a Los Angeles art gallery and the photographer, actor Jason Lee, is offering $25,000 to the photograph back. ""You've taken the one single physical document of the photographer's time with his subject. This is not a print, as there is no negative. There is only this single image,"" the gallery said in a letter on its website addressed to the thief. ""There is no way that this Polaroid will ever have the same worth to you that it holds for Jason."" Lee, who starred in the TV show ""My Name Is Earl,"" loaned the picture to the art gallery and is very sentimental about it, the gallery, which is called This Los Angeles, said. The theft occurred on Feb. 4 when ""someone stole a piece off the wall and bolted out the front door,"" the gallery said. The gallery said Lee is offering a $25,000 reward for the return of the photo. Lee's publicist said the actor was crushed about the loss of the large black-and-white portrait of the legendary actor. ""Jason is devastated and sickened by the theft,"" said Nancy Iannios. ""It has great sentimental value to Jason."" Lee said Hopper also liked the photo. ""As a huge Hopper fan, I was honored to create my one-off large format Polaroid of him. And I was flattered that he liked it as much as he did. He was a great artist,"" Lee said.","The photo was snatched from a Los Angeles art gallery .

"(CNN)  -- Despite reports this week of a return to normalcy on the Egyptian street, the situation on the ground is anything but: Protests continue while statements from the nation's leaders have served only to maintain or even stoke the tinderbox status of negotiations. Demonstrations, which Human Rights Watch says have killed more than 300 people, continued for a 16th day in Cairo's Tahrir Square. ""Nothing will make this regime go unless we keep on coming and keep on coming,"" said Dalia, a protester there who did not give her last name. Another group of protesters tried to prevent the army from breaking up a demonstration at the parliament building in Cairo, and in the northern city of Port Said, state-run TV reported that Egyptians upset over the distribution of land and houses attacked a governor's building. What the protesters want is simple: the end of a regime that has ruled them sternly for three decades. President Hosni Mubarak has refused to step down but has reshuffled his Cabinet and promised he would not run for re-election. Vice President Omar Suleiman has said the government will address press freedoms and the release of detainees. Also, he said on state TV, a committee has been authorized to hammer out constitutional amendments that will permit free, fair and competitive elections. The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition group, responded that the concessions fell short and that the government was attempting to divide the opposition with its announcements. Watch what might be the 'new normal' in Egypt . ""That's not good enough,"" Mohammed Habib, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, said of Suleiman's announcement. ""The first thing that the regime should do is for the president to leave."" The group, which is officially banned in Egypt because of its religious agenda, has rejected the notion of a religious state, saying it wants to participate in forming a democratic government. ""We are not seeking power,"" said Mohammed Morsi of the Brotherhood's media office. Observers say that while Mubarak's ouster is one of the protesters' key demands, the constitution would need a massive overhaul -- not a few tweaks -- because it is seen as a tool for keeping Mubarak's National Democratic Party in power. Parliament would also need to be dissolved because the 2010 elections were widely viewed as illegitimate, analysts say. Anti-government protesters do not trust the process, said Sherief Gaber, an Egyptian-American protester who feels that Suleiman and Mubarak's promises are ""a false act of contrition on behalf of what's effectively the same government it was two weeks ago."" Watch another Egyptian-American's take on the crisis . Police who had largely stood down when the military hit the streets last week are again arresting and harassing protesters, creating a climate of fear, Gaber said. ""I think that this is simply a change of tactics on behalf of the regime, to move from just violence toward the everyday repression that's been going on for years and years and years, and they're hoping to just asphyxiate the protests that way,"" he said. Disappointment with Suleiman and Mubarak was also evident in Washington. Vice President Joe Biden has told his Egyptian counterpart that he wanted to see ""immediate, irreversible progress"" and said the government should quit beating and harassing journalists, lift the country's emergency law and bring a wide range of opposition groups into the national dialogue. Watch why the U.S. is growing frustrated . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs also expressed concern that Suleiman would not rescind the martial law that has given Mubarak sweeping powers for years. Gibbs took particular issue with Suleiman's claim that Egypt was not ready for democracy. ""I don't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress,"" he said. Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's ambassador to the U.S., said the emergency decree would be lifted ""when it was possible in terms of the security dangers that exist."" Watch how the reports from media, government don't always jibe . There are now growing concerns that Suleiman is not on the same page as the White House, said Michele Dunne, a Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Up till now, the Obama administration was saying that this had to be a negotiated transition that the Egyptian government had to deal with the opposition and that the opposition had to be a partner, so to speak, in this transition,"" she said. ""What Suleiman is offering now is not that at all."" As the Muslim Brotherhood has alleged, there are signs that the opposition groups are splintering. Most notably, Amre Moussa, the Arab League secretary general, who stood with the protesters last week, now says Mubarak should be allowed to stay until his term ends in September. Read how the Brotherhood sees itself participating in democracy . ""The danger at the moment is that this opposition, which a few days ago seemed to unite, is now being divided,"" said Cairo-based analyst Issandr El Amrani. ""The regime is using its tried-and-true tactic of divide and conquer."" If nothing else, this week brought the matter of who might lead the opposition into better focus. The question was continually raised when the protests first erupted. And despite heavy media focus on Mohamed ElBaradei, it's unclear whether the former International Atomic Energy Agency chief wields the necessary influence. Now, not only is the Muslim Brotherhood, which held 88 seats in parliament before boycotting runoff elections last year, saying it wants to participate, but Google executive Wael Ghonim has emerged as a face of the revolution. Read what Ghonim demanded of 'heroic Egyptians' Snatched off the streets of Cairo by security forces last month and freed this week, the Dubai-based marketing executive administered a Facebook page in honor of slain activist Khaled Said, which is credited with kicking off the demonstrations. Ghonim has said he doesn't agree with the Brotherhood's ideologies but described them as ""good Egyptians"" and said the group is ""not as bad and evil"" as it has been made out to be. Ghonim has shunned assertions that he is a hero and has said he is ""ready to die"" for change. Though he has called for Mubarak to be treated with dignity, he has also demanded the dissolution of the president's party. From a makeshift stage in Tahrir Square on Tuesday, his words inspired protesters to began chanting his mantra. ""This country is our country, and everyone has a right to this country,"" he told the crowd. ""You have a voice in this country. This is not the time for conflicting ideas or factions or ideologies. This is the time for us to say one thing only: 'Egypt is above all else.' "" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Caroline Faraj, Barbara Starr, Frederik Pleitgen, Ivan Watson, Candy Crowley, Moni Basu and Eliot Spitzer contributed to this report.","Announcement that Hosni Mubarak will not step down renews rage on the street .

"Teresopolis, Brazil (CNN) -- It was like a tsunami from the sky in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state as floodwater gushed through hill towns and giant boulders catapulted from hillsides, instantly crushing cars and houses. At least 540 people have been killed and another 10,000 people living in what used to be picturesque mountain towns popular with tourists have been affected by the torrential rains that began at the start of the year, civil defense authorities told the official Agencia Brasil news agency. Rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas and many more people are feared dead, the agency said. Conditions were so treacherous that rescue teams called it quits Thursday night and resumed their search and recovery work Friday morning. The rain is predicted to continue for several days in areas already submerged in water or slathered with mud. Thousands of families are still living on mountain slopes or on riverbanks and face extreme risk of being washed away. One resident described the disaster as a tsunami that fell from the sky. Chaos reigned in the especially hard-hit city of Teresopolis, where some residents donned masks and helped clean streets or deliver first aid. Others combed the city, searching desperately for missing loved ones. Schools and police stations turned into overflowing morgues, where people waited to identify their family and friends. Municipal worker Reginald de Oliveira came to see if he could find the body of his uncle, missing in the floods. He was trying to save his family when a wall of water washed him away. Red Cross volunteer Maria Helena de Jesus was helping with first aid. ""You have to almost have a heart of stone,"" she said. ""It was very difficult."" Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek declared his city a natural disaster area. At least 229 people died in Teresopolis, while 246 were killed in the town of Nova Friburgo, Agencia Brasil reported. President Dilma Rousseff flew over flood-affected areas Thursday and landed in a slushy, trash-littered soccer field in Friburgo, the agency said. The floods are her first test as president. She trudged through mud in her rain boots to talk to residents in a neighborhood where four of seven firefighters attempting to rescue people had been buried under mud. Three others were pulled out alive. ""We are going to take firm action,"" to help the devastated areas, said Rousseff, who assumed office at the first of the year. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning and allowing people to build homes in areas known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under increasing pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the 2016 Olympics. The roofs of houses and treetops peeked out from the water. People used inflatable rafts or inner tubes to navigate submerged roads. One family sat perched on the roof of their house, their predicament broadcast on television. Another person grasped onto a rope, defying, at least momentarily, the force of an ocean of murky brown water. With more rain forecast, Brazilian authorities have ordered evacuations for at least 5,000 families living in especially perilous areas in Rio de Janeiro state, Agencia Brasil said. Another 3,000 families from a mountainous region were homeless and sheltered in schools and gymnasiums, the news agency said. ""The most important thing right now is to assist the homeless population and reach the most critical points,"" said Rodrigo Neves, the state secretary of Social Welfare and Human Rights. State health officials pleaded for people to donate blood that will be sent to the Serrana region, where only 36 units of blood remained for treatment of flood victims. Rain has affected neighboring Sao Paulo as well, killing 24 people there, authorities said. Journalists Fabiana Frayssinet and Helena DeMoura contributed to this report.","NEW: Death toll rises to more than 500 .

"(CNN) -- It's time for those of us who are good men to start acknowledging the role that male socialization plays in domestic and sexual violence. As good men, we must begin to acknowledge and own our responsibility to be part of the solution to ending violence against women and girls. What is a good man? A good man is a man who believes women should be respected. A good man would not assault a woman. A good man believes in equality for women. A good man honors the women in his life. A good man, for all practical purposes, is a nice guy. We believe this to be the majority of men. There is a minority of men who perpetuate a tremendous amount of violence against women. These men are counting on good men to stay true to rules -- the rules that actually allow them to be who they are in the presence of good men. These rules are what we call the ingredients in the ""man box."" These rules are also the foundation of how we as men collectively define manhood. The man box teaches us as men that we must be tough, strong, aggressive and dominating. We are taught not to show feelings and emotions. We are taught that we should be in charge, leaders and protectors. And if we fall short we lose our status and are placed outside the box. TED.com: Rachel Botsman on the case for collaborative consumption . Outside the box is reserved for women, and for men defined as being less than fully male, or ""woman-like"". The man box at times can be hypermasculine and extremely homophobic. With that being said, ""outside the man box"" is a place most men don't want to be. So we find ourselves staying true to the rules of the man box, many times operating from a subconscious place, just on remote control, doing what's natural to us. We as good men don't realize that every time we tell a boy that he is acting like a girl, we are actually saying that girls are ""less than."" We all know that a college freshman woman is known on campus as ""fresh meat."" And while we know that domestic violence is wrong and a crime, it continues to be tolerated in many of our communities. It is with this understanding that our work, our vision, is not to beat up on good men, but instead to help us understand, through a process of re-education and accountability, that with all of our goodness, we still have been socialized to maintain a system of domination, dehumanization and oppression over women. While we as good men would never hurt women, our collective socialization is the foundation that violence against women is built upon. TED.com: Sam Martin on the quirky world of ""manspaces"" There are three key aspects of male socialization that are the foundation of men's violence against women: . • Men viewing women as ""less than;"" • Men treating women as property; . • Men viewing women as objects. We as good men have to find our voice and began to challenge this collective socialization of men. We as good men have to teach our sons and other young men how to truly respect and promote equality for women. We as good men have to envision the world we want to see for our daughters and other girls -- and in that world how would we want to see our sons and other men acting and behaving. We must as good men understand that the world we want for our daughters and other girls won't happen through osmosis. We as good men have to break out of the man box, stand up and speak out to end violence against women and girls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Porter.","Anthony Porter says most men respect women and honor the women in their lives .
He says male attitudes enable some to lash out at women .
Men are taught not to express their emotions, Porter says .
Men who treat women as property or as objects help enable violence, he says ."
"(CNN Student News) -- February 7, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Egypt • Simi Valley, California • Dallas, Texas . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News! We're back from the weekend with 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines, including why you shouldn't believe everything you read. First Up: Egypt in Crisis . AZUZ: We're beginning in Egypt where there are some signs that things are slowly getting back to normal. In the capital city of Cairo, some shops and banks are re-opening, and traffic is starting to look like it did before the political protests of the past couple weeks. But there are some changes going on in the country. On Saturday, some key members of the ruling party resigned. And yesterday, Vice President Omar Suleiman met with representatives from groups that have protested against the Egyptian government. They talked about some ideas for how Egypt might move forward, although some of the protesters still out in the streets said the people meeting with Suleiman don't necessarily represent them. We've been watching this political unrest in Egypt and other parts of the Middle East. Barbara Starr joins us now to talk about the potential impact that it could have on the American military. (BEGIN VIDEO) BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: With unrest now sweeping across Egypt and neighboring countries, new questions about whether it's a security crisis here at the Pentagon. A quick look at the map tells you how deeply tied the U.S. military is to regimes across the Middle East and Persian Gulf. In Egypt, the U.S. provides around $1.3 billion a year in military aid. In return, the U.S. gets vital military air, land and sea access. U.S. warships transit the Suez Canal on their way to and from the Persian Gulf. Loss of the canal could lead to catastrophic delays and a crisis. In Yemen, where President Saleh is facing demonstrations and has already said he won't run for re-election, the U.S. has been quietly training Yemeni forces to go after a rising threat from al Qaeda. The U.S. has conducted drone and missile strikes inside Yemen. The question: will a new government cooperate with U.S. counterterrorism efforts? In Jordan, King Abdullah is facing increasing discontent due to rising prices and unemployment. Jordan remains one of the U.S.'s closest allies in the War on Terror. Jordan's intelligence services secretly operate against key al Qaeda targets. Jordan has also helped train Iraqi forces, and Jordanian troops serve in Afghanistan. Three key Gulf allies provide other assistance. Qatar is home of the regional headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees the region and keeps a close eye on Iran. Kuwait is a staging area for U.S. troops moving in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq. And Bahrain is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet, which patrols the Persian Gulf and pirate-infested waters off Somalia. The U.S. spends billions of dollars in military aid and assistance across the region in return for all of this access. But the question may now be if the social unrest that is emerging leads to regime change, will the new regimes want to do the old business with the U.S. military? Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon. (END VIDEO) Unemployment Report . AZUZ: The U.S. unemployment rate is down! That should be good news, but it's not that simple. During January, the rate dropped from 9.4 percent to 9 percent flat. But some economists' descriptions of the unemployment report ranged from positive to mysterious to disappointing. One thing most everyone agreed on: the weather played a big role in all of this. All of those snow storms we've talked about kept people from getting out to look for work and kept a lot of companies from hiring. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Armstrong's gifted class at Zora Ellis Jr. High School in Talladega, Alabama! Who won the 1980 U.S. presidential election? Was it: A) Ronald Reagan, B) Jimmy Carter, C) George H.W. Bush or D) Gerald Ford? You've got three seconds -- GO! Ronald Reagan won that election to become the 40th president of the United States. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Reagan Remembered . AZUZ: Ronald Reagan was 69 years old when he won that election. The oldest American elected president and during his his 8 years in office, President Reagan had several famous firsts. He appointed the first female justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. He submitted the first trillion dollar budget to Congress. And he was the first U.S. president to address both houses of the British Parliament. Yesterday would have been President Reagan's 100th birthday. He died in 2004. A ceremony for the late president yesterday included a wreath-laying at his memorial site and a 21-gun salute. As America remembers Ronald Reagan, Ted Rowlands takes us on a tour of his presidential library in Simi Valley, California. (BEGIN VIDEO) FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Video and sound are a constant feature. Reagan's movies and speeches are played throughout. JOHN HEUBUSCH, EXECECUTIVE DIRECTOR, REAGAN PRESIDENTIAL FOUNDATION: We have right over here to my right, the very famous debate with President Carter, where he asked the question, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" ROWLANDS: There's also a Berlin Wall, with tunnels, an interactive videogame table and an inauguration day exhibit complete with Reagan's speech on the TelePrompTer. His diaries have been digitized for people to flip through. There's also an exhibit dealing with the assassination attempt on President Reagan after 70 days in office. As in many presidential libraries, you can see an exact replica of the Oval Office. And Air Force One, the actual plane used by seven U.S. presidents and the one Reagan flew in during his eight years in office. HEUBUSCH: They get to see right where the president sits in the aircraft. They get to see his working quarters. They get to see where the Secret Service would sit, where the traveling press corps sits. They get to touch and feel the airplane. It's just a great experience. ROWLANDS: An Iran-Contra affair exhibit deals with the low point of the Reagan presidency. Also on display, the letter Reagan wrote, with the audio of him reading it, announcing to the world he had Alzheimer's. REAGAN: My fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. (END VIDEO) Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The first Super Bowl was played in 1967. Yep, it's true! That game featured a face-off between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. Super Bowl Ads . AZUZ: In Super Bowl XLV yesterday, you saw it, the Packers and the Steelers. You know what happened in the game. We want to talk about the commercials! Whether you thought these were good or bad, all of them had something in common. They were expensive. The average cost of a 30-second ad in this year's Super Bowl was three million dollars. One industry that was a big part of yesterday's ads: car companies. Nine of them paid to run commercials. Some experts think that could be a good sign for the economy. Here's why: If the companies are willing to spend millions for Super Bowl ads, it might mean they think viewers are willing to go out and buy the cars. And if people are willing to buy big items like that, that could mean people are feeling more confident about the economy. Tree Octopus? AZUZ: Your teacher tells you about an endangered species: the tree octopus. Your assignment is to go learn more about the animal, and there's a web site with all the information you need for your report. Only problem? The entire thing is a hoax! That really happened. The Department of Education sponsored a study run by researchers at the University of Connecticut. They set up this fake web site about the tree octopus filled with all kinds of facts. None of them true; there is no such thing as tree octopus. The researchers wanted to see what kind of impact the internet can have on students' ability to think critically. These were seventh graders. And not only did they accept all the facts on the web site as they were written, after the students were told it was all made up, some of them still refused to believe it was a hoax. Blog Promo . AZUZ: I've never spoken to a student who says he believes everything he's read on the internet. But this study would suggest that many students actually do! We want you to visit our blog today and tell us: What can be done to be sure that what you see online is the truth? CNNStudentNews.com! Before We Go . AZUZ: Two things I can do: I can run four miles, and I can eat a dozen doughnuts. But not at the same time! That's the challenge these folks took on over the weekend. It's the annual Krispy Kreme Challenge. You run two miles, eat a dozen doughnuts, then run two miles back. And you have to do it all in under one hour. I don't think you need an excuse to down a dozen doughnuts, but this race does raise money for charity. Goodbye . AZUZ: And that kind of thing always makes you feel good, doughnut?

"Islabamad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A man who confessed to assassinating a leading liberal Pakistani politician is being showered with gifts and praise by his fellow prison inmates, his attorney told CNN. Mumtaz Qadri was arrested earlier this month, moments after he allegedly sprayed Salman Taseer, governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, with more than 20 bullets outside a market in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. At the time of the shooting, Qadri was working as one of Taseer's security guards. Police said Qadri confessed to the killing and said he assassinated his boss because of Taseer's campaign to change Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws. At the prison just outside of Islamabad where Qadri is being kept, fellow inmates are offering him their clothes, blankets and meals, said Qadri's lawyer, Malik Waheed Anjum. He said his client has no regrets over Taseer's death and spends most of his time reciting the Quran in jail. ""Qadri is proud and satisfied with what he did,"" Anjum told CNN. Pakistan's hard-line religious groups have also congratulated Qadri. Since the shooting they have held demonstrations calling him a hero, while condemning anyone who tries to change Pakistan's blasphemy laws. At the rallies, pictures of Qadri's smiling face regularly adorn posters and banners. In Pakistan's major cities, liberal and moderate groups have held competing although much smaller demonstrations condemning Qadri and praising what they call Taseer's campaign to change the blasphemy law that they claim was being misused to persecute minorities. At a hearing on Monday inside Qadri's prison, investigators submitted to a judge their findings, claiming Qadri was indeed Taseer's killer. Police recommended the death penalty for Qadri, said Raja Shuja Ur Rehman, another member of his defense team. Court officials said they held the hearing inside the prison to avoid a repeat of mass demonstrations that took place when Qadri was transported to a courthouse earlier this month. He is scheduled to be formally charged at a hearing in February. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Salman Taseer, Punjab province governor, was assassinated earlier this month .

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Inter Milan continued their march up the Italian Serie A table, beating 10-man Roma 5-3 in a thriller at the San Siro. Samuel Eto'o scored twice, with the returning Wesley Sneijder, Thiago Motta and Esteban Cambiasso also on target as Leonardo's side moved up to third place in the table, five points behind leaders Milan but with a game in hand. Inter took a third minute lead when Sneijder fired home an unstoppable shot after collecting Maicon's pass but Roma levelled 10 minutes later when Simplicio turned in Marco Cassetti's cross. However, the home side went into the break 2-1 ahead when Eto'o fired a shot that slipped through the hands of goalkeeper Sergio. The game turned Inter's way early in the second half when Nicolas Burdisso was sent after fouling Giampaolo Pazzini in the area and Eto'o stroked home the penalty to take his season's tally to 27 goals in all competitions. And Inter Milan increased their lead even further when Motta headed home from close range. However, Roma fought back and Mirko Vucinic pulled one back when diverting home Daniele De Rossi's free-kick and they reduced the deficit to 4-3 when Simone Loria prodded home from close range after Juan's header struck the post. But there was to be no dramatic comeback and Inter secured their victory through Cambiasso's late goal. Milan dropped two points after behind held to a 1-1 draw at Genoa, despite Pato giving them a 29th minute lead from close range. However, Antonio Floro Flores levelled on the stroke of half time when he was on hand to fire home after Mathieu Flamini deflected the ball into his path. Napoli are now just two points behind Milan in second place after bouncing back from their shock midweek defeat at Chievo to beat Cesena 2-0. Serie A top scorer Edinson Cavani opened the scoring with his 18th league goal of the season and Jose Sosa added a second in injury time for the home side.","Defending champions Inter Milan continue their march up the Italian Serie A table .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Opposition groups in Jordan are upset with King Abdullah II's choice for a new prime minister, saying the decision should have been made in a different way. Jameel Abu Baker, spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, said the appointment of Marouf Al Bakhit was a surprise. ""The change we demanded should have been done through the formation of a national unity government headed by an agreed-upon personality, and then holding early elections, and setting a new law for democratic elections,"" he said. In appointing Al Bakhit on Tuesday, Abdullah instructed the new government to take ""practical, swift and tangible steps to launch a real political reform process."" He said a new election law would be the ""main pillar of political development."" Opposition parties -- especially the Islamic Action Front -- are demanding that parliament, not the king, choose the government. But it has always been the prerogative of Jordan's king to dismiss and appoint governments. Baker said Al Bakhit's previous term as prime minister had seen election fraud, and the Muslim Brotherhood had not been allowed to take part in political life. Zaki Bani Ershaid, an influential figure in the Islamic movement in Jordan, said Al Bakhit was ""not a man of reforms, and so he should stop all plans to form the new government."" Another opposition figure, Saeed Thiab of the Union party, said experience with Al Bakhit was not positive, but the party would wait to see what reforms were proposed. Street protests across Jordan in recent weeks have focused on demands for a more open political process, as well as economic grievances. Fuel and food prices in Jordan have risen sharply in recent months, reflecting higher world prices for wheat and oil. The protests have stopped short of criticizing the king -- but are widely thought to have influenced the timing of Tuesday's announcement. King Abdullah acknowledged the reform process ""has suffered from many shortcomings"" and young Jordanians were frustrated by lack of opportunity. Further protests are expected Friday. CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .","King Abdullah II named Marouf Al Bakhit to be Jordan's prime minister Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. high commissioner for refugees announced an inter-agency appeal Wednesday for $280 million to support Iraqi refugees. The Regional Response Plan for Iraqi Refugees includes the plans of 40 international organizations and non-governmental organizations supporting Iraqi refugees in 12 countries, including Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and the six Gulf states, according to a statement from Antonio Guterres' office. ""I appeal to donor governments to recognize the critical needs of Iraqi refugees, particularly those who are becoming more vulnerable by the day,"" the high commissioner said in the statement. The U.N. refugee agency said more than 190,000 Iraqi refugees are registered in the region, with the majority living in Syria and Jordan. Many have struggled to find employment, and some Iraqi refugee children have dropped out of school to find casual work to help feed their families, the agency said.

"Rome (CNN) -- Prosecutors in Milan, Italy, are investigating allegations that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi paid for sex with a minor, a case that has stirred scandal, but not in every quarter. Some Italians have no problems with the allegations of their leader's sexual escapades that have garnered so much attention. ""Who cares? I am so sick and tired of this story. What happens in a private home is his business and I don't want to know,"" said Nicoletta Cosimini, the owner of a lingerie shop. Such an attitude is a throwback to an unspoken tradition in Italy of successful men taking on girlfriends and lavishing them with gifts. Many frown upon this, but it remains acceptable to others. ""Those men who say that Berlusconi should be ashamed of himself, I say to them, 'Why?'"" said clothing store owner Simonetta Giannini. ""Wouldn't you like to do it? You all do and you are just jealous. There are more serious troubles in this country than to go after Berlusconi's whores."" Berlusconi has denied that he has ever paid for sex. In Italy, having sex with a prostitute is not a crime -- unless she is a minor. El Mahrough, nicknamed Ruby, is the nightclub dancer at the center of the most recent headache for Berlusconi. She is now 18, but was 17 at the time of the alleged activity, from February through May. Ruby has said in an interview she told everyone she was 24. They both deny having had sex with each other, but a roommate of Ruby's said in a court document that Ruby admitted to having had an affair with the premier when she was 17. Prosecutors are looking into it as a prostitution-with-a-minor case, though some wonder if Ruby's involvement with Berlusconi qualifies as prostitution. Ruby's former roommate told police, ""I remember that she would say that she was a close friend of the Prime Minister ... she said she was often in the premier's house, where she had dinner, danced and had sex with him and who gave . her a lot of money."" Berlusconi says that the prosecutors have no jurisdiction to investigate him, while opposition lawmakers have urged him to speak with them. ""We think he should just go and tell what he thinks is his truth,"" opposition lawmaker Giovanna Melandri told CNN. ""If he has any dignity, he should leave the post and allow Italy to start again with a political leader who is not engulfed in scandal."" Other Italians were also not forgiving of their prime minister. ""It shames me as a citizen, as a man, and as a father,"" a businessman said. ""We have to keep our values. If not it would be total anarchy. It is disgusting what he does and even more disgusting that pages and pages of media go after this stuff because there is even worse and more serious trouble in this country."" A grocery man, Marcello Picchione, also denounced Berlusconi's alleged actions. ""Unfortunately it is nothing we didn't know. It happens everywhere. I'm not surprised but it disgusts me that our prime minister does those things,"" he said. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Milan prosecutors are investigating whether Berlusconi paid for sex with a minor .

"(CNN) -- Bubba Watson believes he can now challenge golf's top stars after heading off three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson for an emotional victory at Torrey Pines in California on Sunday. The 32-year-old climbed 15 places in the world rankings to 18th as he claimed the second PGA Tour title of his career at the Farmers Insurance Open, while fellow American Mickelson reclaimed the No. 4 spot after finishing second on his first start this season. Watson started the final round one shot behind joint overnight leader Mickelson but carded an impressive five-under-par 67, which included six birdies and just one bogey, to finish the San Diego tournament on 16 under. World number four Mickelson could have forced Watson into a playoff had he made eagle on the 18th hole, but a miss from 72 yards allowed his Florida-born opponent to celebrate victory by just a single shot. Mickelson's fellow overnight leader Bill Haas faded badly on the final day, finishing on nine under after a 75. For Watson the victory was particularly emotional following the death of his father to cancer last year, shortly after his only other PGA Tour win at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut. ""It means a lot,"" he told reporters. ""I'll probably cry all day, just like last time."" The 32-year-old said the win had given him the confidence to compete with the world's best at major championships. ""In my mind, I believe I can be a top-five player. I want to. I want to be number one in the world. I want to win every golf tournament,"" he said. ""I want to perform every week. I want to be on every Ryder Cup team, every Presidents Cup team. I believe I can do it. I truly believe it."" San Diego-born Mickelson, a three-time winner on the Torrey Pines course, said he was disappointed not to have made a better start to the season at his local tournament. ""I wanted to start the year off with a win,"" the 40-year-old said. ""But on the other hand, I played really good golf and gave myself an opportunity. ""I played well on Sunday and had a good tournament. Hopefully, I'll use this as a springboard for next week."" Former world number one Tiger Woods made a poor start to 2011, finishing in a disappointing 44th position. In his first competition of the year, the event's five-time champion failed to birdie any of the par-fives and finished with a round of 75. ""I have some work to do. There's no doubt about that,"" the American said. ""I hit it as pure as I could possibly hit it starting out, but got nothing out of it."" Venezuelan rookie Jhonattan Vegas followed up his victory at the Bob Hope Classic last weekend with a third-place finish as he ended the tournament on 13 under along with American Dustin Johnson. Vegas shot 68, and his third bogey of the day at 18 meant he shared the prize money with Johnson, who ended with two birdies in his flawless 66. D.A. Points was fourth on 12 under after a 67, while fellow Americans Nick Watney (63), Anthony Kim (72) and Hunter Mahan (72) were tied for sixth on 10 under. Watney, starting on the back nine of the South Course, started with five successive birdies, picked up three more from 16, and capped his round with an eagle three at the sixth.","America's Bubba Watson claims second PGA Tour title at Torrey Pines, California .

"(CNN) -- Most Olympic athletes will use any natural advantage to win gold and Shaun White is no exception -- the only difference is that the champion snowboarder says it's a life-threatening heart condition as a child that has given him the edge. Born with a condition that can lead to blue baby syndrome, White had two open-heart operations before he was 12 months old, something he believes has given him the will to win. ""If you have something dramatic like that happening to you at that age it puts something in you,"" says the laid-back Californian and double Olympic Champion. ""You're fighting to survive at that young age it puts a little fight in you. It's one of those messages of don't give up and don't ever let people or things or your own mind tell you what you can't do."" White has wasted no time since then. An undisputed giant who has transformed snowboarding from a snow dog hobby into a global sport, he got his first snowboard sponsorship at the age of seven, became a pro at 13 and picked up his first gold medal at the Turin Winter Olympic Games at the tender age of 19. Now at 24, and with two Olympic championships under his belt, the laid-back Californian has become his own brand. His prodigious skills, both on a snowboard and a skateboard, meant he had something of a double life growing up. Eventually competing on the slopes won out and school was exchanged for a private tutor. Despite having won everything in the sport -- he holds 16 ""X Games"" medals -- his education on the slopes continues. ""It's funny to see how far you can come within a couple of years,"" he says. ""A lot of people, they can't stand the pressure of having to win, of having to feel like people are watching or expecting things. I love it. I like the fact that people are counting on me to do something brand new, something that's never been done before and be the guy. I like that feeling and so I use it as a motivator, I tend to rise to the occasion."" He was certainly ahead of his time, competing against people much older than him when other children his age were just starting high school. ""It's bizarre. Everybody was a lot older than I was by the time I went pro at 13. I had been winning the amateur contests for like five years in a row but it was always the same run... It's a very different story when you show up to an event and you hope to win, you are the guy to beat, you know it's a little different,"" he says. ""I'd win snowboard contests and I couldn't get the award because it was at a bar so I'd be sitting outside like 'Hey, I won, going to go home now and play video games' you know."" White's biggest achievement came winning his first gold medal at the Olympics in 2006, but he's been able to appreciate all the highs of his career to date. ""It's usually the first time you won something that makes it the most special moment, like the first time I won 'X Games', I won two golds,"" he says. ""I didn't make the Olympics when I was 15 by three tenths of a point so it was like 'Should he go? No, not yet'. I remember coming back and winning that when I was 19 and it was the best thing ever."" White was recently in China promoting the sport in a booming winter sports market, as well as being on call for some of his sponsors. Balancing his snowboarding and his business interests can be tough, he says. ""You can get lost in the products and doing all these things but I hold true to myself that I am a snowboarder, I always add things to that. ""That's the way it is for me and snowboarding. I like to take my time away from it and come back feeling stronger and refreshed and able to do new things. ""And if you've been sitting in the mountains for a month, just been sucked in and you're not doing anything where's your motivation? Where's your lust to go out there and learn something new and a trick that could possibly injure you. It's one of those things where you need to feel that way and you need to feel excited.""","Shaun White is the most successful snowboarder .

"(CNN)  -- Ricky Ponting looks set to lead Australia into the Boxing Day Test against England at the MCG despite a broken finger. Ponting came through a batting practice session in Melbourne on Friday, spending about half an hour in the indoor nets before venturing outside to further test the injury. The 36-year-old suffered the mishap to the little finger of his left hand as he attempted to catch a ball on the final day of his side's triumph in the third Test in Perth. The victory leveled the five-match series at 1-1, making the Christmas clash all the more important. Is Australia's one-day reign set to end in 2011 ? Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke is confident Ponting will be fit to play on Sunday. ""We are all very hopeful and pretty confident that unless they cut his finger off, it is going to be really hard to leave 'Punter' out,"" he told gathered reporters. ""I think he is going to have to wait until tomorrow to see how it pulls up after having a bat today, but he is pretty happy with how things went."" The uncapped Usman Khawaja has been added to the Australian squad as cover for Ponting. Meanwhile, England's injury worry James Anderson also appears to be winning his fitness battle.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A wave of bombings left 51 people dead and more than 120 wounded Thursday in various Baghdad neighborhoods, including one in which angry residents later threw stones at security forces, the Interior Ministry said. At least 48 people were killed and 121 wounded when a parked car bomb detonated near a funeral tent in the predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Shula in northwestern Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. After the Shula bombing, people threw rocks at security forces, the official told CNN, and some people fired guns. Security forces withdrew until an Iraqi Army unit dispersed the crowds by shooting in the air and imposing a partial curfew in Shula, the official said. The gathering of the crowd reflects the growing frustration and anger against the government and security forces, especially by the country's Shiites, who have come under intensive attacks in recent days. Iraq has witnessed in the past 10 days constant high-profile attacks, mainly targeting Shiites and security forces, that have claimed the lives of more than 200 people. Some 151 people were killed in the entire month of December. Attacks on security forces in Tikrit and Diyala were claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq. There was no claim of responsibility for attacks on the Shiites. Officials have blamed al Qaeda and other Sunni extremist groups of carrying out these attacks in an attempt to reignite the sectarian war that gripped Iraq for years. Many Iraqis blame their security forces for not preventing these attacks and question the abilities of these forces to secure the country, especially as the U.S. military prepares for a complete troop withdrawal by the end of this year. Many have blamed the deteriorating security situation on politicians still not agreeing on key security posts that remain vacant in the government formed more than a month ago. Meanwhile, three people died in three other attacks in the Iraqi capital. A roadside bomb exploded next to a police patrol in southern Baghdad, killing a civilian and wounding seven people, including three police officers. In another attack in southeastern Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near a government convoy. It missed the convoy but killed one civilian and wounded three others. In central Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded on a busy road, killing one civilian and wounding four. The blasts came after Wednesday night's assassination of three government employees by gunmen using pistols equipped with silencers in three neighborhoods in Baghdad. Two of the three government employees worked at Iraq's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the third employee worked at the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction.","NEW: Angry citizens throw stones at security forces .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinian leaders privately agreed to accept a very limited return of the 6 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants to previous homes in what is now Israel, leaked documents showed Tuesday. The leaked documents dealing with the sensitive issue of the ""right of return"" for Palestinian refugees comes a day after the Arab news network Al-Jazeera began releasing documents revealing details of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The leaks have prompted protests and outrage in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the minutes of a meeting in January 2010 Palestinian Chief Negotiator Saeb Erakat told U.S. State department official David Hale that the Palestinians had accepted a ""symbolic number"" of refugees returning to Israel. In minutes from a meeting the year before with his own negotiating team Erakat said that the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had accepted the return of a 1,000 refugees annually for a period of ten years. Speaking to negotiators in 2009 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said, ""On numbers of refugees it is illogical to ask Israel to take 5 million or indeed 1 million -- that would mean the end of Israel."" The ""right of return"" is a highly sensitive topic for both Palestinians and Israelis and remains one of the core sticking points in achieving a peace deal. Any concession on the issue of refugees by either side poses huge difficulties with their political constituencies. For most Palestinians the eventual return to their former homes in what is now Israel remains a fundamental requirement while Israelis argue that the large-scale return of refugees would spell the end of the Jewish majority state. Complicating matters for the Palestinian Authority in dealing with the issue of refugees return are comments attributed to Erakat from the minutes of a 2007 meeting with the Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht in which the chief Palestinian negotiator suggested that refugees would not have the right to vote on a peace deal. ""I never said the Diaspora will vote. It's not going to happen. The referendum will be for Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Can't do it in Lebanon. Can't do it in Jordan."" In a statement Monday, Erakat said that ""a number of reports have surfaced regarding our positions in our negotiations with Israel, many of which have misrepresented our positions, taking statements and facts out of context. Other allegations circulated in the media have been patently false."" He added, ""Our position has been the same for the past 19 years of negotiations: We seek to establish a sovereign and independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital and to reach a just solution to the refugee issue based on their international legal rights"", adding any proposed agreement ""would have to gain popular support through a national referendum."" Other revelations from the second day of leaked document include: . -- The suggestion by then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in a 2008 tri-lateral meeting with Israeli and Palestinian officials that refugees could be sent to outside countries such as Chile and Argentina; . -- the suggestion in 2008 meetings by then Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni that future land swaps should include Israeli Arab villages; . -- the refusal of the Obama White House to accept a Bush administration decision to use 1967 borders as a baseline for negotiations between Israeli and Palestinians about any proposed land swap agreement. On Sunday Al-Jazeera began its release of over 1,600 documents dubbed ""The Palestine Papers."" The first release of papers suggested that Palestinian negotiators offered to give up large swaths of East Jerusalem to Israel during negotiations dating back to 2008 and that they had been willing to offer much larger concessions in private than they were acknowledging public. The leaked papers brought a furious reaction form Palestinian Authority officials with President Abbas calling the release ""shameful."" ""The report aired by Al-Jazeera is an intentional mixing between the many Israeli proposals and the Palestinian positions,"" Abbas said in Cairo, Egypt, in comments published by the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Yasser Abed Rabbo, a senior Abbas adviser went further, accusing Al-Jazeera of a ""smear campaign."" ""What happened is a manipulation of the documents and a misrepresentation of the facts and a true distortion, just for mockery and defiance,"" Abed Rabbo told reporters. Contacted by CNN, al-Jazeera declined to comment on the criticisms from the Palestinian Authority. Dozens of Palestinians gathered Monday in central Ramallah, burning banners for Al-Jazeera and holding posters comparing the channel to Israel. Several demonstrators also attempted to storm the offices of the al-Jazeera office but were turned back by Palestinian police personnel. U.S. State department spokesman P.J. Crowley refused to comment on any of the specific documents, but told reporters that their release complicated the efforts to get Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table. ""We don't deny that this release will, at least for a time, make the situation more difficult than it already was,"" Crowley said. ""We continue to believe that a framework agreement is both possible and necessary."" The papers, some of which were posted on the Al-Jazeera network's website, shed new light on the details of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from 1999 through last year. CNN could not immediately verifiy the documents.","New documents show Palestinian leaders agreed to accept a ""symbolic"" return of Palestinian refugees to Israel .

"(CNN) -- The new Roman Catholic archbishop of Seattle, J. Peter Sartain, was installed Wednesday afternoon with a Mass in the archdiocese's cathedral, amid ongoing controversy over Sartain's ordination of a priest who later pleaded guilty in a molestation case. ""I resolve to serve faithfully the spiritual needs of this church,"" Sartain told congregants and priests filling St. James Cathedral. He then officially assumed his seat behind the altar to a minute-long ovation. Sartain, 58, who was ordained in 1978, most recently served as bishop of the Joliet, Illinois, diocese for four years. It was an official act during his tenure there that prompted a handful of protesters to gather outside the cathedral Wednesday. John Shuster of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests said he was upset by the Vatican's decision to install Sartain because Sartain ordained Alejandro Flores in 2009 even though diocesan officials had concerns about Flores' use of male pornography. ""Why would he even ordain him anyway? Who would take that chance?"" Shuster told CNN affiliate KIRO-TV in an interview before the protest. After his ordination, Flores was accused of molesting a suburban Chicago boy over a five-year period beginning in 2005, SNAP leaders said, citing news accounts. Flores pleaded guilty in September and was sentenced to four years in prison. SNAP describes itself as the world's oldest and largest support group for clergy abuse victims, and the group is asking the church and Illinois prosecutors to provide more information about Sartain's handling of allegations surrounding Flores. The Archdiocese of Seattle has said that once Sartain found out about the allegations, he reported them. Sartain replaces Archbishop Alex J. Brunett, 75, who retired last year. At then end of his installation Mass, Sartain turned to his predecessor, Brunett, and praised him. ""A final word of thanks goes to my friend, Archbishop Brunett,"" Sartain said, whose remarks drew supportive applause. ""What an extraordinary job he has done in the Archdiocese of Seattle. ""Thank you so much for welcoming me as you have. For many years to come, we will love our Lord,"" Sartain told attendees.","New Seattle Archbishop James Peter Sartain was the bishop in Joliet, Illinois .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Thousands of people who filled the streets of Cairo Tuesday hope their demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies will cause upheaval in the government, like the similar protests in Tunisia that inspired them. But analysts caution that in Egypt, the protesters are up against a different set of challenges. Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan and blogger, describes Tunisia as ""a little bit unique."" ""There have been lots of civil wars. There's been lots of societies in turmoil. But this kind of phenomenon where you had crowds peacefully coming into the streets to demand a change in their own contract with their government -- in the Arab world proper, this is the first time it's happened and it's the first time since 1979 in the Middle East,"" Cole told CNN last week. He noted that Tunisia is the ""most secular country in the Arab world."" Its traditions have favored women's rights and its Islamist influence is negligible. Tunisia also lacked the oil resources of other Arab states and the ethnic divisions seen in other Middle Eastern countries, which make it harder for opposition movements to unite, he noted. Looking at the protests Tuesday in Cairo, Mamoun Fandy of the International Institute for Strategic Studies told CNN he was not seeing a ""turning point or tipping point yet."" Noting the strength of the army, he said, ""The Egyptian system is too strong and too resilient."" A key question that will show the potential strength of the demonstrations Tuesday is whether hardcore protesters will stay through the night, or whether the rallies will fizzle down, he said. Eric Trager, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Pennsylvania and a former Fulbright fellow in Egypt, wrote in The Atlantic, ""Egypt's liberal activists overwhelmingly come from the wired generation of Twitter and Facebook, and this makes them optimistic that pro-democratic movements can go viral, even in a political environment as traditionally illiberal as the Middle East... Yet Egyptian activists face tremendous odds -- in particular, an entrenched dictatorship that is determined to discredit the very idea of domino-effect democratization."" Time.com published a story Thursday from writer Abigail Hauslohner in Cairo headlined, ""After Tunisia: Why Egypt Isn't Ready to Have Its Own Revolution."" Some Egyptians ""believe the time is now"" for protests to bring about change like in Tunisia, and several people in Egypt have set themselves on fire or attempted to in recent days -- much like the self-immolation of a young unemployed man in Tunisia that sparked protests in that country, she writes. ""But in Egypt, it doesn't go much deeper than that."" A greater percentage of Egypt's population than Tunisia's lives below the poverty line, she writes. ""The citizens of Egypt regularly complain of a neglectful regime that knows more about torture than it does about public service, and they're furious with a regime that seems to swallow any domestic profits before they can reach the lower classes. And yet no one predicts a revolutionary reset anytime soon."" Two factors distinguish Egypt from Tunisia in this respect, Hauslohner writes: Tunisia's government spent generously on education, creating a frustrated educated but unemployed population. And in Egypt, ""the military stands with"" Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Time.com is a partner of CNN.com. Writing in Newsweek, journalist Mike Giglio suggested the ""upcoming protest in Cairo could mark the beginning of another upheaval."" ""Tuesday will be the first real test of whether the revolution is contagious,"" he wrote in a story published Monday. Many protesters believe their demonstrations will prove to have far more power than naysayers suggest. A Facebook page that has served to help organize Tuesday's protests in Cairo says, ""Many young Egyptians are now fed up with the inhuman treatment they face on a daily basis in streets, police stations and everywhere... Egyptians are aspiring to the day when Egypt has its freedom and dignity back, the day when the current 30 years long emergency martial law ends and when Egyptians can freely elect their true representatives.""","Analysts: Egypt is a different story from Tunisia .

"Washington (CNN) -- For most divers, a shark in the water can inspire fear, or even dread. Greg Marshall wanted to hitch a ride. More specifically, Marshall was inspired by the shark's constant companion, a remora -- a torpedo-shaped fish that commonly catches a ride by sucking onto the shark's rough skin and thriving on the shark's leftovers. Marshall thought to himself: What if you had a camera as small as a remora? What if you could stick a camera on a shark so that the shark goes about its life, unaware that its actions were being recorded away from the distractions of photographers in scuba suits? Where would it go, and what would you see? For a naturalist, being able to observe animal behavior without interfering with the world the animal inhabits by the simple act of being there is the gold standard. In scientific terms, it's similar to a control in an experiment. But that goal is usually unobtainable -- observing how an animal acts in captivity, for example, is no indication of how an animal actually behaves. Observing that behavior in the wild, Marshall says, is equally problematic. ""When we're in an animal's habitat, they know we're there,"" he says. ""And they're reacting to us."" And knowledge of an animal's actual behavior, Marshall says, is absolutely critical to reaching the correct conclusions about a creature's habitat and behavior, and how humans may be disrupting both. Of course, the best way to observe real behavior in the wild is to have omniscient powers of observation, or perhaps a camera lens as long as your arm and as expensive as a new car. Or you can see what the animal sees, courtesy of ""Crittercam."" Twenty-five years after that underwater epiphany in the waters off Belize, Marshall and his far-flung team of naturalists and engineers are getting closer to that gold standard. Technology may finally be catching up with inspiration. Marshall took his initial ideas for ride-along observation technology to the National Geographic Society in 1987. Now he's vice president of the society's Remote Imaging division -- an effort by a team of scientists and engineers working with researchers around the globe capturing footage of how animals behave in the wild, away from the interference of the observers. ""Crittercam enables us to get out of the picture entirely -- to ride along, almost completely unobtrusively, to see their world and their behavior,"" he says. Latest Crittercam news, virtual tours and more at NationalGeographic.com . Marshall is a real-deal explorer, a tall, lanky, gregarious type who seems more suited to a dive boat in the Sea of Cortez or a snowmobile in Antarctica than an impressively equipped machine shop in the basement of the fabled headquarters of the National Geographic Society. Marshall still gets more than his fair share of exploration -- a day after this interview, he was off to Antarctica, again. But more often he's back in Washington, at his desk or in an edit bay. Still, adventure is where you find it -- and sometimes, it's in the most unlikely of places. Cracking open a newly recovered Crittercam remora (or box, or sphere, or whatever device his crew of happily mad scientists invent to capture hitherto-unwitnessed moments in nature) is, for Marshall, full of the rush of exploration. When Crittercam got its start, the results of all the hard work came down to a small, fragile tape. Nowadays, the data is stored on a tough, solid-state memory card. But seeing the data of the first time, Marshall says, is always a rush. ""You start looking at the screen because you never know what you're going to see. It's completely engaging and captivating,"" he says. The results, Marshall says, run the gamut from inspiring and revelatory to downright boring -- at least, boring to a typical National Geographic Channel viewer. But to a marine biologist like Marshall, even the ""boring"" stuff can have stop-in-your-tracks potential. Case in point: Sperm whales. They are one of the deepest-diving species on the planet. Years ago, his crew successfully attached an advanced Crittercam to a diving sperm whale. ""The first 10 seconds are fascinating, because you see the whale diving down,"" Marshall says. ""And then it dives down into utter darkness. And then we're looking at a black screen for the next two hours."" But that Crittercam was also equipped to record sound, as well as video. And in that utter blackness (sperm whales can dive almost two miles down), the Crittercam whale began a conversation with another whale -- a cascade of powerful, rapid-fire clicks. That whale conversation kept Marshall and his editors transfixed. It wasn't a made-for-TV moment, but it was yet more evidence that just about every deployment of the Crittercam system can reap unexpected rewards. In the frigid waters off Alaska, a Crittercam captured an intimate view of a humpback whale calf nursing. There's dizzying footage of a tree kangaroo (yes, there's a kangaroo that climbs trees) high in the jungle canopy of New Guinea. A sea lion in Australia plays with its food -- in this case, a hapless octopus. There's even a brief glimpse of a great white shark swimming at eye-popping speed, chasing an equally quick seal. ""You just never know what you're going to get -- it's just completely engaging,"" he says with a broad grin. Crittercam footage finds its way into many of National Geographic's nature programs. And the best Crittercam moments are a rare combination of good television and good science. That's partly the goal of the whole program, Marshall says.

"(CNN) -- The turmoil that's roiled Arab states from Tunisia to Yemen is also creating a headache for those entrusted with reviving economies hard hit by rising energy and food prices, growing public debt and the prospect of more expensive borrowing on the international markets. Since mid-January, credit rating agencies such as Moody's have downgraded the sovereign debt of Tunisia, Jordan and Egypt. On Tuesday Moody's changed the outlook on Jordan's foreign currency bonds to negative from stable, citing ""fiscal and economic downside risks related to ongoing turmoil in the region following events in Tunisia and Egypt."" Moody's said that Jordanian protesters ""could use the regional uprisings as an opportunity to express their discontent about high unemployment and the lack of development for low-income groups."" Standard & Poor's, another major credit rating agency, made a similar move. Jordanian officials are not happy with the downgrade, arguing that their public finances are sound -- Jordan's foreign currency reserves actually rose last year and stand at about $12 billion -- and that the economy may grow as much as 6% in 2011. Protests there have been largely peaceful and far smaller than in Egypt and Tunisia. But after pledging to cut the budget deficit, the government reversed course in January with a package of subsidies and salary increases amounting to some $600 million, to compensate for higher prices. International bond markets are wary that governments may try to ""buy their way"" out of trouble, in the words of one analyst. It is a potentially toxic cycle, according to regional economists. Egypt and Tunisia have already suffered a loss of tourism revenue in peak season, while record-high grain prices and a surge in the price of crude oil have fueled inflation. Jordan imports 90 per cent of its oil, and faces disruption to its gas supplies after an explosion at a pipeline in Egypt last week. Like Jordan, Egypt has opted to spend more on subsidies for the poor. The recent street protests, now in their third week, have led stores, businesses, the stock market and banks to close -- a further cost. Until the protests erupted, Egypt had a positive reputation in the international debt markets -- with attractive interest rates for investors, banks that had avoided high-risk investments, a manageable budget deficit and low overall sovereign debt. Like Jordan, it was working to cut its budget deficit. But markets abhor uncertainty and the government's cost of borrowing has risen sharply since the protest movement erupted -- although it has fallen back slightly in recent days. Earlier this week, the Egyptian Central Bank intervened to support the pound against the dollar, spending precious foreign currency in the process. And before the Egyptian stock market closed, some $5 billion was wiped off the value of Egyptian stocks in just two days. In addition, government wages and pensions in Egypt have been increased 15 per cent. Credit strategists say any labor unrest -- especially at the Suez Canal where a strike began among service workers Wednesday -- would put Egypt's finances under further pressure. Shipping has so far been unaffected by the labor action. Market commentators say that international investors are already avoiding Egyptian Treasury auctions -- another is due next week -- meaning local banks are expected to pick up the slack. One former Jordanian official told CNN that he hoped the country's vulnerable economic state and its value to the United States as a reliable pro-Western ally would prompt greater financial support from Washington. Last year, foreign grants -- mainly from the United States and Saudi Arabia -- totaled more than $400 million. But there is pressure on the U.S. federal budget too.","Credit rating agencies have downgraded the debt of Tunisia, Jordan and Egypt .

"New York (CNN) -- Three people who contracted cholera at a wedding in the Dominican Republic before returning to New York have recovered, and the risk of their infecting anyone else is low, officials said Sunday. None of the three adults had to be hospitalized, said Erin Hughes, spokeswoman for New York City's health department. Person-to-person transmission of the disease is highly unlikely, Hughes told CNN in an e-mail. ""Cholera is spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacteria. This happens in places with inadequate water treatment and poor sanitation. New York City's water is clean and safe."" On average, one case a year of cholera is reported in New York, she said, and it is ""almost always in someone who has traveled abroad."" The Centers for Disease Control will test samples to confirm the illness and determine from which strain the people were sickened, said CDC spokeswoman Candice Burns Hoffman. Cholera is a ""nationally notifiable"" disease, she said, and samples from all suspected U.S. cases are sent to the CDC for lab testing and confirmation. The Dominican Republic is investigating the outbreak at the wedding, Hoffman said. ""It's not uncommon for cholera outbreaks, like the one that has moved rapidly through Haiti, to spread to other countries,"" Hoffman said. ""We have seen a few cases in travelers returning to the U.S. The risk for secondary infection in the U.S. is low.""","The 3 adults were guests at a wedding in the Dominican Republic .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A teenage suicide bomber killed at least 27 army recruits and wounded 42 others Thursday when he blew himself up at a military training center in northwest Pakistan, officials said. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, saying it was a ""message for those who wish to join (the) pro-American military."" ""We will continue targeting Pakistan military until it stops supporting the U.S.,"" said Azam Tariq, the central spokesman for the group. The suicide bomber, who was about 14-years-old, was wearing a school uniform, a senior Pakistani military official said. The military official asked not to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The teenager detonated his explosives after walking onto the grounds where army recruits were receiving their morning training, according to police chief Abdullah Khan. The bomber was either carrying the explosives in a bag or wearing a suicide vest, officials said. A school for children of military recruits is located inside the training facility. The attacker was probably pretending to be a student there, the military official said. The attack took place in Mardan, a district 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of Peshawar in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, formerly known as the North West Frontier Province. Peshawar is the gateway to the country's tribal region where security forces have been battling an insurgency led by the Pakistani Taliban. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: The Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for the blast .

"(CNN) -- Robert Kubica's Lotus-Renault team said Monday that the F1 star was ""much better"" after undergoing emergency surgery in an Italian hospital following his crash while competing in a motor rally. The 26-year-old Pole spent the night in an induced coma after a seven-hour operation to repair multiple fractures to his right arm and hand. Kubica required several transfusions during the procedure to stabilize his condition after losing a lot of blood following the high-speed accident. But in a statement on the team's official website, they said that Kubica had been briefly woken by doctors at the Santa Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure and was able to talk to his relatives. ""He was also able to move his fingers, which is an encouraging sign for the rest of the recovery process,"" it said. Dr. Mario Igor Rosello, the specialist who operated on Kubica, claimed the lack of swelling or infection on his right forearm was also a ""good sign"" but added it will be ""several days before it is known if the operation is 100 per cent successful."" Kubica badly hurt in rallying crash . Kubica suffered multiple fractures to his right arm and leg after hitting a guard rail when he lost control of his Skoda Fabia during the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy. With the first race of the new Formula One season in Bahrain next month, his Lotus Renault team defended Kubica's decision to take part in a rally so close to the start of the season. ""He loves rallying,"" team boss Eric Boullier told Italian news agency Ansa. ""We knew the risks and so did he. We didn't want a robot or a corporate man for a driver. It was agreed."" Kubica finished 2010 in eighth position and was due to start his fifth campaign as a first-choice driver, but there are now doubts as to whether the former Sauber driver will be fit to play any part in the 2011 campaign. When asked about the length of time it could take for 2008 Canadian Grand Prix winner to recover, Rossello is reported by the BBC to have said, ""One year. One year is the best provision."" Kubica also suffered fractures to his shoulder and elbow and Lotus Renault said the hospital would decide over the next few days if further operations were necessary on these injuries. Support has been offered from throughout the close-knit world of F1 for the only Polish driver to have ever driven at this level, including a specially-designed ""Twibbon"" on the social-networking site Twitter. McLaren's 2009 world champion Jenson Button tweeted, ""Shocking news about Robert Kubica. I wish him a speedy recovery."" Another driver to offer his sympathies was Williams' veteran Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, who used his Twitter blog to say, ""I would like to ask you for your best wishes to Kubica,"" and ""we all like him and he deserves all the best."" If Kubica is unable to take to the grid for the start of the season, Lotus Renault may choose to promote one of their two reserve drivers. The team's two options are Bruno Senna, who raced for HRT in 2010, and Frenchman Romain Grosjean. The 2011 Formula One season is set to get underway at Bahrain's International Circuit on March 13.","NEW: Lotus-Renault say Robert Kubica ""much better"" after his rally crash .

"(CNN) -- A Colombian rebel group is expected to release two hostages Friday, according to a former senator who helped coordinate the humanitarian mission to free them. ""A very productive night, everything is ready for the liberations tomorrow, nobody said that it would be easy, we are not losing hope that together we can weave peace,"" former Sen. Piedad Cordoba said on her Twitter account late Thursday night. Marine Henry Lopez Martinez and politician Armando Acuna were scheduled to be released Friday, she said. They are among a group of five hostages that the FARC leftist guerrilla organization has pledged to release. Red Cross rescuers are participating in the mission. Helicopters bearing the organization's symbol flew into the jungle Wednesday to free the first of the group: a councilman from the town of San Jose de Guaviare. Some have suggested the hostage releases could fuel renewed dialogue between Colombia's government and the rebels. But news of two more kidnappings by the FARC drew the ire of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. The president said Thursday that he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the Carton de Colombia company had been kidnapped in southwestern Colombia Wednesday night. ""We are not going to suspend the liberations, because I do not want to frustrate the excitement and hope of the families of these hostages that are going to be freed, but what I want to say is that this game, this double standard, is totally unacceptable,"" he said. Two other hostages -- a police major and a military service member -- are expected to be released Sunday. The FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia, have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. In December, the FARC announced its plans to release the five hostages as a humanitarian gesture. In its December statement, the FARC criticized Colombia's attorney general for removing and disqualifying Cordoba from serving in the legislature. The attorney general cited her close ties to the group as the basis for Cordoba's removal from the Senate.","The hostages scheduled to be released Friday are a politician and a marine .

"London (CNN) -- Protesters made ""some contact"" with Prince Charles' wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, during a demonstration in London last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said Sunday. May, whose responsibilities include domestic security, refused to confirm Camilla was ""poked with a stick,"" as some British media have reported. Charles and Camilla's car was hit with paint and a window was cracked as the vehicle drove through protesters en route to a show in central London on Thursday night. Neither of them was injured, although the duchess looked shaken as she got out of the car. May has not offered to resign over the incident, she said Sunday on Sky News. Police released images Sunday of 14 people they want to question in connection with violence at the demonstration, which was to protest government plans to let universities triple their tuition fees. ""We want the public to help us identify these people who may have been involved in violent disorder, attacking police officers and smashing buildings, shops and windows,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Matthew Horne said in a statement. ""The vast majority of the people we are seeking are suspected of committing serious offences of violent disorder and criminal damage,"" he said, without specifying whether any were directly involved in the attack on the royals' car. Separately, police arrested a man Sunday for swinging on a flag at a London war memorial during the student protests. Charlie Gilmour, the son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, apologized Saturday for doing that, but London's Metropolitan Police declined to identify the man they arrested, other than to say he was 21 years old. Cambridge student Gilmour said: ""This is probably the worst thing I've done"" on Facebook, his university's student newspaper reported Saturday. ""I just wanted to swing from a flag, I didn't realise it was the Cenotaph. I feel so ashamed of myself right now."" Gilmour and his mother did not immediately reply to CNN requests for comment. The man arrested Sunday is not one of the 14 people whose photo was released by police, they said. The Cenotaph, outside the Foreign Office in central London, commemorates Britain's war dead, and is where Queen Elizabeth II and British officials lay flowers every November on Remembrance Sunday. A total of 34 people were arrested at the demonstration Thursday, the fourth in a series of protests against the planned tuition increase. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Friday that protesters who resorted to violence will ""feel the full force of the law,"" and blamed them for wreaking havoc in London during the pre-Christmas weeks. Addressing reporters, Cameron defended the government's contentious move to triple tuiton at UK universities and said protesters, not the police, should be blamed for the chaos. ""I immediately rang the Prince of Wales,"" Prince Charles, said Cameron. ""We need to learn the lesson of this incident,"" he said. On Friday, police sifted through rubble strewn over London's Parliament square, searching for clues and culprits in Thursday night's protests, where students and their supporters, enraged by the tuition hike, broke windows and ambushed the royal vehicle. ""It is not the fault of the police,"" said Cameron. ""It was the fault of those who tried to smash that car."" Members of the National Union of Students condemned any forms of violence, including from the police, they said in a statement on their website. ""Regarding many of the scenes that were witnessed yesterday, whilst it is clear that there were a small number of people involved who were inciting violence, many people were contained for a long period of time when attempting to take part in peaceful protest,"" the NUS stated. ""We are calling on the Metropolitan Police to have a full investigation into the clashes yesterday between protesters and the police and for it to look again at its tactics for policing demonstrations,"" it said. A photo of the royal couple, dressed in evening wear, made headlines as it showed the startled expressions on their faces as they sat in their Rolls-Royce before exiting for a Royal Variety Performance. The royal couple escaped unhurt. Police said the route had been cleared minutes before the royal couple was due to make their journey. The high-profile incident came late in a day of violent protests that left at least 12 officers and 43 demonstrators hurt. London's Metropolitan Police issued a statement Friday condemning the protests and alleged vandalism that took place Thursday night, claiming protesters intimidated Christmas shoppers and bystanders. ""This has nothing to do with peaceful protest,"" the statement said. ""Students are involved in wanton vandalism including smashing windows in Oxford and Regent streets."" The protests followed a vote in the House of Commons to approve a plan to raise the existing cap on tuition rates charged by universities from £3,000 to £9,000 a year. In U.S. dollars, that's a nearly $10,000 a year increase -- from . roughly $4,700 to $14,000. Lawmakers approved the plan in a 323-302 vote. The measure awaits approval by the House of Lords and a signature by the queen before it can become law.","NEW: 21-year-old arrested for swinging on a flag at war memorial .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- The man who accepted three uncut diamonds from supermodel Naomi Campbell and held them privately for years is stepping down as a trustee of the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the fund said. Jeremy Ractliffe will not run for reelection as a trustee at the end of this month, the fund said Wednesday. He is also resigning immediately as a board member with the U.S. affiliate of the fund, it said. Ractliffe came under international scrutiny in early August when Campbell testified at the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. She was asked about reports that Taylor gave her uncut diamonds in 1997, a story that prosecutors hoped to use as evidence to prove Taylor used ""blood diamonds"" to fund a brutal civil war in Sierra Leone. While Campbell said she didn't know whether Taylor was the source of the diamonds, she testified she gave them the next day to Ractliffe, a friend who at the time was the head of the children's fund. Ractliffe said in a statement afterwards that he kept the diamonds to protect the reputations of both Campbell and the charity. He handed the diamonds over to South African police after Campbell's testimony. ""Mr. Ractliffe regrets his omission to inform the chairperson, CEO, and the rest of the board of trustees of the NMCF of his receipt of the uncut diamonds until now and acknowledges that had he done so, he and the board could have found a better and lawful way to manage the situation,"" the fund said in the statement. ""He has apologised to the chairperson, CEO, the board, and the NMCF for the anxiety and possible reputational risk his conduct may have caused to the NMCF."" Under South African law, the possession of uncut or rough diamonds is restricted to permit-holding producers, cutters, and toolmakers. Any other person who finds or receives unpolished diamonds is required to take them to a police station immediately. ""Mr. Ractliffe has stated that he acted in what he sincerely believed to be in the best interest of the NMCF and its founder and realizes that he has left himself open to possible prosecution,"" the fund said in its statement. ""For these reasons, he considers it correct and proper for him not to make himself available for reelection as a trustee."" Conflict or ""blood"" diamonds are diamonds that are illegally traded to fund conflict in war-torn areas, particularly in central and western Africa, according to the World Diamond Council, which represents the commercial diamond trade. The United Nations defines conflict diamonds as ""diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council."" They are generally in rough form, meaning they have recently been extracted from the earth and not yet cut. At the height of the civil war in Sierra Leone, it is estimated that conflict diamonds represented approximately four percent of the world's diamond production.","Jeremy Ractliffe held on to diamonds given to him by Naomi Campbell .

"(CNN) -- After a judge temporarily lifted a gag order so that he could respond to allegations made on YouTube by his ex-wife, comedian Steve Harvey Tuesday released court documents saying those allegations are false. Mary Harvey posted a series of videos on YouTube last month about the breakup of the couple's marriage and the bitter fight that followed. She alleged that following their 2005 divorce, Harvey ""turned my son against me, had me evicted from our house, thrown out, all the businesses, all the money, the cars ... He manipulated the courts, everything against me."" Steve Harvey could not respond at the time because of a gag order in the case, said attorney Bobbie Edmonds. But Edmonds released a statement Tuesday saying the judge had temporarily lifted the order so Harvey could respond. Some of the documents released Tuesday are redacted, but they say the court found that Mary Harvey: . -- ""was not homeless or evicted from her home and was awarded three homes in the property settlement;"" -- that Harvey ""did not take, withhold or turn the child against Mary Lee Harvey;"" -- that Mary Harvey ""willingly placed the child on an airplane and sent him to Mr. Harvey without his knowledge;"" -- and that Harvey has primary custody of the 13-year-old. In addition, the court documents said, Mary Harvey received $40,000 a month from Harvey until March 2009 and received $1.5 million from him in March 2009. In the series of videos, Mary Harvey included excerpts of letters and e-mails she said she intercepted between Harvey and his current wife, Marjorie, near the end of her 16-year relationship with him. She said on their second wedding anniversary, ""it hit me really hard"" when she intercepted a love letter from a mistress -- the woman he would later move in with and marry. Edmonds said in late January Marjorie Harvey was ""contemplating"" filing a defamation suit against Mary Harvey because of the accusations against her. The 2005 divorce between Steve and Mary Harvey, according to the court documents released Tuesday, ""was granted on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and his current wife was not named in the original divorce proceeding, nor was she the cause of the marital breakup."" Attempts by CNN to contact Mary Harvey and her attorney on Tuesday were unsuccessful. A court hearing was held Monday in Collins County, Texas, on the matter. Harvey asked for sanctions against his ex-wife for allegedly violating the injunction barring her from talking about the family law case in the media or on the internet, and he was allowed to respond. Harvey ""is authorized to publish this order for the limited purpose of refuting the allegations of respondent Mary Lee Harvey,"" the documents said. ""... all prior injunctions and gag orders remain in full force and effect."" The judge also ordered Mary Harvey to remove the videos from the internet -- YouTube and any other sites where they were located. A hearing is set for March 10, the documents said. Edmonds said that hearing is on contempt of court allegations against Mary Harvey. ""During the contempt hearing, the court will listen to the evidence of the parties and determine if there is a violation of the orders and impose the appropriate sanctions and punishment."" CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.","The documents say that Mary Harvey was not evicted or penniless .

Get ready to update your maps, because the world is about to get a new country! I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News! First Up: Meeting with Business . AZUZ: First up, President Obama and business: can they work together? The president has not had the best relationship with business leaders, specifically with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The group was against the health care and Wall Street reform laws that the president pushed for and passed. And the Chamber supported a lot of Republican candidates in last year's midterm elections. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the country's largest business organization. It represents 3 million businesses from all across the U.S. And its main purpose is to work on behalf of those businesses, especially in Washington. During his speech to the 200 members of the Chamber yesterday, President Obama acknowledged the tension between them. But he says he's convinced that they can and must work together. One thing that both sides want: more jobs. The president promised that he'll work on programs and policies, like spending money on education and improving transportation networks, that would help the country's businesses and would help get the economy back on track. Economy in Turmoil . AZUZ: Things are moving forward in Egypt. The country's new Cabinet had its first meeting yesterday. There are some protesters still out in the streets, saying they're not gonna budge until President Hosni Mubarak steps down. Mubarak has said he won't run for re-election in September. We've talked a lot about what all this political upheaval could mean for Egypt's government in the future. Frederik Pleitgen is looking at what it means for Egypt's economy right now. Here's his report. (BEGIN VIDEO) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As anti-Mubarak protesters remain entrenched in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the effects of the uprising are visible nationwide. This is Stella Heliopolis, a massive real estate development outside Egypt's capital with 1,500 housing units under construction. Owner Ayoub Adly Ayoub says work has come to a virtual standstill since the protests began. AYOUB ADLY AYOUB, PRESIDENT, REMCO GROUP: We had to slow down because we could not get the materials in time, most of the laborers could not come. Now, we are starting to organize ourselves to go back to work. Maybe $4 - $5 million of losses per month at least. PLEITGEN: Ayoub says if things don't improve, he might have to start laying off workers. One bank estimates this crisis is costing Egypt more than $300 million a day as the economy remains in a state of paralysis. Egypt's economy is losing a lot of money every day and business people fear the long-term consequences could be grave, as investors lose their confidence and tourists start choosing other destinations. Many business sectors are affected, some only now coming back to life. As shop owners slowly began opening their doors on Cairo's streets on Sunday, banks serviced customers for this first time since the beginning of the crisis. To prevent the masses from pulling their cash out of the institutions, private withdrawals were limited to $10,000 or 50,000 Egyptian pounds. Despite long lines, most appeared calm. UNIDENTIFIED MALE [TRANSLATED]: ""There are a lot of people who are withdrawing money because banks were closed in the last few days,"" this man says. ""Many people are withdrawing money."" PLEITGEN: Ayoub Adly Ayoub says though the fallout from the uprising is seriously hurting his business interests, he understands the anti-government protesters. AYOUB: I have personal sympathy for them. I think there was corruption, it is a time of change. But my personal view is that we should give the people that are in charge now that are trying to clean up and put this country together a chance. PLEITGEN: But it doesn't seem like the anti-government protesters are willing to give the current government that chance. As many Egyptians fight for social change, many workers on construction sites like this one are fighting and praying to keep their jobs. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Cairo, Egypt. (END VIDEO) Sudan Vote . AZUZ: To the south of Egypt is Sudan, a country that's about to be split in half -- literally. In a referendum last month, nearly 99 percent of southern Sudanese voted to split from the north and form their own country. Sudan's north and south fought a war against each other for more than two decades. The peace treaty that ended that conflict led to this vote. The country's president has said he'll accept the results of the election, so Southern Sudan could become the world's newest nation by this summer. This Day in History . AZUZ: It's February 8th.

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The symptoms of a concussion can include nausea, dizziness and memory problems. This is true. And anyone who's gotten one of these brain injuries is more likely to get another one. Protecting Young Athletes . AZUZ: Concussions are pretty common in contact sports like football. At the NFL level, there are around 100 concussions every year. But when you look at the number of teens and younger kids who go to the ER for sports-related concussions, that number jumps to more than 100,000! Doctor Sanjay Gupta shows us how one program uses prevention and preparation to address the problem. (BEGIN VIDEO) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Most of these players see themselves as mini-versions of these guys. CHRIS NOWINSKI, PRESIDENT, SPORTS LEGACY INSTITUTE: Youth football is trying to be the professional game, sometimes for good, but sometimes for bad. GUPTA: The good? Competition. Camaraderie. The bad? Concussions. And the ugly? A tendency trickling down from the pros to hide head injuries. NOWINSKI: When you are 13, you have the same drives to play through pain, play through injury - not wanting to look weak in front of your friends or weak in front of your enemies. Guys went great lengths to hide injuries or not talk about them. GUPTA: It turns out hiding has consequences, first seen at the NFL level. Retired players consumed with depression, rage, memory problems. Their symptoms associated with the mysterious brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It looks like dementia, but it strikes players in their 30s, 40s and 50s, sometimes younger. NOWINSKI: The reality is, we do have cases of teenagers having the disease. We're primary football players. Some play multi-sports, but they all had brain trauma. CARMEN RODA, PRESIDENT, WESTPORT POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE: Well, it's brain damage. I mean, that's what it comes down to. How can you want that for any child? Does your head go up or down? TEAM: Up! RODA: Head goes up or down? TEAM: Up! RODA: Let's go! GUPTA: Carmen Roda coaches the Wreckers. It's a team of fifth graders in Westport, Connecticut. Last year, he had a typical playbook. RODA: We do drills like bull in the ring, you know, one kid's in the middle and you walk around and tap a kid, and then you just go at it, head-to-head, hammer to hammer. GUPTA: And during games? RODA: The kid came out and he got a hard hit, what we used to call a stinger or a ding, you know. We would sit there and say, ""Hey, are you OK?"" And then send him back in if he answered yes. GUPTA: When his team clocked 20 concussions in one season, Coach Roda said enough. His new playbook starts with a concussion course for coaches, parents and players; a trainer at games and practice. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have any nausea or dizziness? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. GUPTA: And far less hitting in practice; an emphasis on technique, not brute force. RODA: This is what we don't want to see. OK? The spine is lined up. The head is down. GUPTA: The impact? The Wreckers cut the number of concussions in half and still made the playoffs. NOWINSKI: It did not hurt the kids' ability to play the game. It just dramatically lowered their injury rate and their head trauma rate. And so, when you look at how simple those things were made in one season, in one program, you wonder why isn't everybody else doing this? (END VIDEO) Facebook Promo . AZUZ: Good info there.

"(CNN) -- The Arizona Senate Judiciary Committee began holding hearings Monday afternoon on proposals to end birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Lawmakers in a total of 40 states are considering similar proposals ""to correct the monumental misapplication of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,"" according to the legislators' new group, State Legislators for Legal Immigration. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified in the wake of the Civil War, provides in part that ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" The provision has the effect of granting ""birthright"" citizenship to anyone born in the United States, even if both of the child's parents are in the country illegally. The Arizona proposals, introduced by Republicans two weeks ago and quickly opposed by Democrats, are the latest measures following new Arizona laws that seek to crack down on illegal immigration but have landed up in court. Sponsors of this latest legislation have said they hope the bills, if one becomes law, also will provoke a lawsuit so that the U.S. Supreme Court can re-examine the meaning of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. Mike Philipsen, spokesman for the state senate's Republican majority, which holds 21 of the chamber's 30 seats, said the judiciary committee is scheduled to hear two hours of testimony from supporters and opponents of two bills seeking to end birthright citizenship for babies born on U.S. soil to illegal immigrants. Under the proposals, Arizona would create a special class of birth certificates for children who are born to parents who can't prove their citizenship. The committee is chaired by the bills' Senate sponsor, Ron Gould, said Philipsen. ""These folks are essentially gaming the system to put themselves ahead of the line,"" Gould told CNN, referring to illegal immigrants giving birth to children in the United States as a way for their children to have citizenship. A similar measure is sponsored in the House by Rep. John Kavanagh, whose chamber has yet to schedule a hearing, Philipsen said. ""Obviously with this issue, there's going to be a lot of debate on it, there's going to be a lot of people speaking on it,"" Philipsen said of Monday's scheduled two-hour hearing. If approved, the legislation would apply only to children born after the law went into effect or after a ruling from the expected court action, Kavanagh said. Advocates of the Arizona proposals and others like them being planned in several states argue how during an 1866 Congressional debate, U.S. Rep. John Bingham of Ohio, considered one of the fathers of the 14th Amendment, said ""...every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural born citizen...."" Pennsylvania state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, a Republican who's the founder of the State Legislators for Legal Immigration, said that Bingham's comment is the basis for his group's efforts in several states to form a compact defining the 14th Amendment. They argue that the reference to ""parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty"" means the 14th Amendment was not intended to apply to children born of citizens from other countries. ""It's very important for those who are in elected office to uphold and defend the Constitution and to ensure the Constitution is applied correctly and the laws of our nation are the result of the correct application,"" Metcalfe told CNN. ""That is the only way we're going to protect American lives, liberties, and property from the illegal alien invasion that's occurring on our soil."" By noon Monday, several dozen members of Border Action Network and other community organizations gathered outside the Arizona Senate in Phoenix to participate in what was supposed to be a ""one-thousand baby chain"" protesting the Senate hearing, which began at 2 p.m. (4 p.m. ET). The hearing ended later Monday afternoon without the committee taking any action on the legislation. ""Our legislators need to stop these incredibly expensive, 'quick-fix' approaches to a broken immigration system,"" Jennifer Allen, executive director of Border Action Network, said in a statement.  ""We need legislators with political spine to say that we need to protect all children, protect our Constitution and fix our immigration system."" Arizona Senate Minority Leader David Schapira, a Democrat, called the proposal legislation ""a waste of time"" and unconstitutional. He told CNN the proposed legislation would also seek to create an interstate compact between Arizona and other willing states that would recognize the proposed new class of birth certificates for non-citizens. ""Arizona's fiscal situation is among the worst, if not the worst, in this country. I can't believe we're wasting our time on this,"" Schapira said. Given how sponsors ultimately seek a lawsuit before the U.S. Supreme Court, Schapira said: ""It's really misplaced priorities."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to take up such a case. ""This is not something that the Supreme Court is going to revisit,"" Toobin said. ""It's not like it's been controversial for 150 years. ""This is really a frivolous endeavor,"" he said. ""The law is so clear on this issue. The language of the 14th Amendment says all persons born in the United States are citizens. It doesn't matter who your parents are or if they're in this country legally or illegally. ""This group is better off trying to amend the Constitution than to pursue this law, which in my opinion is unconstitutional,"" Toobin said. CNN's Casey Wian contributed to this report.","At issue is ""birthright citizenship"" for children of illegal immigrants .

"(CNN) -- Never underestimate the power of the dark side. Scratch that. Let's go with never underestimate the power of a cute blond kid cloaked in the robes of Mr. Dark Side himself, Darth Vader. Despite having already been on television since 2009, 6-year-old Max Page is winning more fans than he likely ever could have imagined after his appearance in a Super Bowl advertisement for Volkswagen. ""My dad said I'm the hit star!"" Max said Tuesday during an appearance on CNN's ""American Morning."" You've doubtless seen the commercial by now. As many as 110 million Americans who watched the Super Bowl on Sunday saw it, and it's been viewed more than 20 million times on YouTube. It depicts a young boy dressed in Vader's black robe and helmet feverishly trying to get something -- anything -- to obey ""The Force"" and bend to his will. He tries the washer and dryer. A doll. A sandwich. Nothing happens. Not even the family dog is moved. But when he tries to wield ""The Force"" on his dad's new car, the engine roars to life -- with a little help from dad and his keyfob, of course. You can almost see Max's eyes, wide-open with amazement, as he holds his arms out and turns to his unseen parents as if to say, ""Did you see that?"" ""Lance Acord, the director, said what he brought to the spot when they were filming was more of an authenticity because he wasn't mimicking Darth Vader,"" Max's mom, Jennifer said. ""He was just challenging Darth Vader and doing what he thought Darth Vader looked like."" In fact, Star Wars fans might note Max bears some resemblance to the actor who played young Anakin Skywalker, who later turned into Darth. And fans are also comparing him a young Mark Hamill, who played Vader's son, Luke Skywalker. Not that any of it means much to Max. He still hasn't seen any of the movies. ""He's a little scared, still,"" his mother said. Max's story has another twist. He has a congenital heart defect and wears a pacemaker. But he leads a normal life, his mother said. ""Once these kids get mended they can go and live full lives and that's been a huge inspiration for others already,"" she said. Max spent most of his appearance on CNN Tuesday fidgeting with a boxed set of all the Star Wars movies -- a gift from co-host Kiran Chetry. He did take a moment to turn to the camera, raise his eyebrows and wave. ""Hello!"" he said to the camera, as oblivious as any 6-year-old to the grown ups talking around him.","A 6-year-old boy is winning fans after being revealed as the face behind the Darth Vader mask .

"(CNN) -- Injured Formula One star Robert Kubica needs more surgery before he can start rehabilitation following his crash at the weekend. The Polish driver's team said the 26-year-old would remain in hospital for up to three weeks after the operations in Italy, where he had been competing in a rally event. ""On Thursday, Robert should undergo some more surgery in order to stabilize the fractures to his right shoulder and right foot,"" Lotus Renault announced on its website on Tuesday. ""Three or four days later, another operation will allow his elbow fracture to be stabilized as well. Robert will remain at the Santa Corona Hospital for two to three weeks. A decision will then be taken about where he should go in order to continue his rehabilitation."" The Britain-based team said Kubica, its lead driver ahead of the 2011 season, was determined to fight back from the multiple fractures. He is being treated at Santa Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure. Kubica badly hurt in rallying crash . ""Yesterday, Robert was able to talk to his doctors and relatives. His medication makes him sleep quite a lot, but he is responding to all external stimulation,"" the statement continued. ""He has reacted well to the news about his condition and is ready to fight for his comeback."" Kubica required several transfusions during the initial seven-hour emergency procedure to stabilize his condition after losing a lot of blood following the high-speed accident. Renault and Lotus launch new cars . By Monday, Renault reported that he could move his fingers, while his surgeon Dr. Mario Igor Rosello said the lack of swelling or infection on his right forearm was also a ""good sign."" Kubica, who hit a guard rail when he lost control of his Skoda Fabia during the Ronde de Andorra rally, is certain to miss the start of the F1 season in Bahrain on March 13. In his place, Lotus Renault could promote one of the team's two reserve drivers -- Bruno Senna, who raced for HRT in 2010, and Frenchman Romain Grosjean -- to line up on the grid with young Russian Vitaly Petrov.","Robert Kubica to have more operations on Thursday and then a few days later .

"(CNN) -- Football officials are apologizing to ticket-holding fans who were denied seats at Sunday's Super Bowl, but that may not be enough to stop lawsuits over the issue from going ahead. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Monday took full responsibility for the seating fiasco, in which about 400 fans with tickets were denied seats because certain sections of Cowboys Stadium in Dallas, which hosted the event, weren't ready. A total of about 1,250 fans were affected, but roughly 850 of them were relocated to other seats, while the remaining 400 were left without, the NFL said. Some people in the Dallas Cowboys organization volunteered to give up their employee tickets so affected fans could have a seat, Goodell said. ""We apologize to those fans that were impacted by this,"" Goodell said at a news conference Monday. ""We will certainly do a thorough review and get to the bottom of why it all occurred, but we take full responsibility for that as putting on this game."" NFL Executive Vice President Eric Grubman said the problem was officials ""just ran out of time"" to complete infrastructure like railings and steps and to tighten risers. Employees were still trying to get the work done as late as Sunday afternoon, he said. The Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl on Sunday night, defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25. Matthew Rush, 40, a Steelers fan originally from Pittsburgh, was one of the 400 or so fans left without a seat at the big game. After spending the whole day being moved around to different parts of the stadium while officials tried to accommodate them, Rush and others were eventually moved to a glassed-in bar just below field level where they could watch the game on television monitors, he said. What view they had of the field was obscured by those standing on the sidelines, he added. ""It was happening 300 feet in front of us, but (it was as though) we weren't there,"" Rush told CNN on his way back from Dallas on Tuesday. After halftime, Rush said, he and others were so frustrated that they left the stadium, and he watched the remainder from his hotel room. Rush said he spent a total of about $5,000 to attend the Super Bowl with his wife. He spent $800 per ticket, which he purchased through the Steelers' season-ticket-holder lottery. The NFL promised to give a free ticket to next year's Super Bowl and a refund of triple the cost of the $800 face value of the ticket to each of the 400 fans denied seats on Sunday -- or a free ticket to a future Super Bowl game of the fan's choice, plus round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations. Fans can pick the option they want. But Rush said that doesn't make up for the anger, frustration, and disappointment he still feels at missing his beloved Steelers at the big game. ""I actually feel worse for the Packers fans, because they missed their team winning the game,"" he said. Rush said he's further angered by Grubman's revelation that football officials were aware of a potential seating problem as early as the middle of last week. Grubman said officials had still hoped to complete the work by game day, so they didn't warn fans about a problem. ""We made a judgment that we had a very good shot to be able to complete it,"" Grubman said. ""We made a judgment that it was the right course of action to bring the fans in, rather than discourage them or create a sense that they wouldn't have the information necessary."" Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones on Monday said the Cowboys ""deeply regret"" the problems experienced by the affected fans and share the responsibility for it with the NFL. Rush has started suesuperbowl.com, one of at least two websites for fans mulling possible lawsuits over the seating issue. He said he is obtaining legal counsel and is urging affected fans to get in touch. So far he has heard from about a dozen people, he said. ""We're still figuring out what our rights are, whether damages come into play or not,"" he said. ""This is more than just a breach of contract. ... This was a very traumatic experience for a lot of these people."" Another website compiling submissions from angry fans is superbowlsuit.com, started by Wes Lewis of Los Angeles. Lewis, 26, told CNN he was one of the 850 fans initially denied a seat but later accommodated. He went to the game with his father, who was able to enter the stadium -- but when Lewis presented his ticket, he was told to go to the ticket resolution center. He said he waited there with other fans for nearly three hours with no information from officials. Eventually, Lewis said, someone from the NFL handed them fliers that promised the triple refund and entry to a hospitality area to watch the game. Angry and frustrated, that's when he started his website, using his cell phone, Lewis said. In the end, Lewis said, he was able to join his father in the stands in their original seats -- but he said he still feels a duty to keep the site running. ""The NFL has an ethical, moral obligation to rectify this, and I have a moral obligation because the site's at the forefront of the situation,"" Lewis said, adding he doesn't feel the league is doing enough. Lewis and Rush said they're in touch with each other and are coordinating their efforts. Lewis said he's not focusing on lawsuits as much as trying to collect the stories of affected fans; so far he has had about 250 submissions, including about 50 detailed stories. Asked about possible lawsuits, Goodell said Monday, ""We're more concerned with making sure we take care of the fans in an appropriate way, and that's what we're going to focus on.""","NEW: Fans can choose tickets to Super Bowl 2012 or one of their choosing, NFL says .

"(CNN) -- Protests in Egypt have dominated international headlines of late, but signs of unrest are prevalent in several countries throughout the Middle East and Africa. Emboldened by an uprising in Tunisia, which saw the nation's president of almost a quarter century flee to Saudi Arabia, protesters have staged similar demonstrations from Lebanon to Yemen to Algeria. Here are the latest developments across the region: . Egypt . Protesting lawyers toppled barricades at Cairo's Abdeen Palace, and petroleum, railway and telecommunications employees called strikes to stand in solidarity with the protesters. Thursday marked Day 17 of the protests. Despite promises of reforms and constitutional amendments to allow for free elections, demonstrators were angered by President Hosni Mubarak's refusal to immediately step down. Protests were further fanned when Egypt's Vice President Omar Suleiman said Egypt is not ready for democracy. Last week: Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq apologized for the violent attacks on protesters as the military took position between pro- and anti-President Hosni Mubarak supporters. It did not stop the two sides from clashing. Shafiq and Vice President Omar Suleiman were meeting with opposition groups, including protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, state media reported, but some administration opponents have rejected the invitation. Jordan . King Abdullah II swore in a new government Wednesday, which included several opposition figures, members of several political parties, an independent Islamist and the editor of a newspaper that is sometimes critical of the government. Officials close to Abdullah say the king is hoping to turn the regional upheaval into a genuine opportunity for reform, but the nation's Muslim Brotherhood has refused to join the government, saying the prime minister should be chosen by parliament, not the king. On Wednesday, Jordanians gathered in front of of the Egyptian Embassy to demand that their loved ones jailed abroad be returned home. An iReporter captured some of the protesters on camera as they accused countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria and the United States of holding their loved ones without due process. Last week: Abdullah responded to protests by dismissing his entire government. Jordanians, who rely heavily on international aid, have been hit hard by rising wheat and oil prices in recent months, as well as high youth unemployment. The government recently restored subsidies and improved pay for civil servants, and the king directed new Prime Minister Marouf al-Bakhit, an ex-intelligence chief, to tackle corruption, enact political reform, spur development and strengthen democracy. Though some groups have backed out of planned protests, the Islamic Action Front said it plans to continue street demonstrations Friday in protest of al-Bakhit's appointment. Yemen . There has been a lot of political jockeying since pro- and anti-government demonstrators took to the streets last week . Many Yemenis say they do not believe the situation there will get to the point it has reached in Egypt or Tunisia, but they also expressed concerns about unemployment and their future. On Monday, Prime Minister Ali Mujawar said his country is democratic and accused opposition parties of ""trying to duplicate what happened in Tunisia and Egypt, and act as if it should be imposed on the people here in Yemen."" Last week: President Ali Abdullah Saleh had said he would not seek re-election and would not pass power to his son, but it wasn't enough for thousands of anti-government protesters who gathered near Sanaa University in the nation's capital. They spoke out against poverty and demanded that Saleh, whose term ends in 2013, step down. Saleh said he has requested his party to freeze debate on a constitutional amendment to end term limits until a consensus is reached. Syria . A Facebook page dubbed ""Syrian Revolution 2011"" attracted 15,000 friends in a week, Time magazine reported. Like other regimes in the region, Syria faces political alienation, economic dislocation and corruption, but because it has been the subject of international sanctions, it is beholden to no Western powers. This separates Syria from places such as Egypt and Tunisia, analysts told the magazine. According to Human Rights Watch, security services have beaten and detained protesters. A candlelight vigil in old Damascus for the Egyptian protesters was broken up by people in civilian clothing, and police nearby failed to intervene. When one of the vigil's organizers went to police, she was slapped and called a ""germ,"" the watchdog group said. Last week: After seeing unrest in the region, President Bashar al-Assad said he would push for political reforms in his own country because waiting for protests like those in Egypt and Tunisia might make it ""too late to do any reform."" Reform activists used Facebook to call for demonstrations in Damascus, Aleppo and other cities, but it was unclear how many people would turn out. By all accounts a police state, Syria has been ruled by President Bashar al-Assad for more than 10 years. Before him, his father, Hafez al-Assad ruled the country for almost three decades. Tunisia . A transitional government is overseeing sweeping changes after massive demonstrations forced out the country's longtime president. Internet filters have disappeared and there is unfettered access to websites. Journalists are learning how to create a free press and are transforming their newspapers, radio broadcasts and television stations. Reforms are taking place in every region of the country, and people are expressing their opinions openly in the streets, something that didn't happen under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Still, small incidents disrupt daily activity. The incidents are widely believed to be perpetrated by people who once worked for Ben Ali's secret police and are aiming to destabilize the transitional government. Last week: The north African nation charged Ben Ali, as well as his wife and several relatives, with maintaining and exporting foreign currency illegally, carrying weapons and ammunition without licenses and inciting armed violence among Tunisians. The ex-leader fled to Saudi Arabia last month after mass protests that left more than 100 people dead. Protests there began when demonstrators -- credited with starting the ripple effect of protests across North Africa and the Middle East -- lashed out at poor living conditions, high unemployment, government corruption and repression. Sudan . Final results of last month's referendum show that the southern Sudanese voted almost 99 to 1 to split from the north, leading to what will be the world's newest nation in July. An election official said the vote was peaceful and transparent and ""not a single person showed up to appeal the results."" Despite the vote's smoothness, violence erupted on the north-south border when Sudanese soldiers loyal to Gabriel Tang, a southern Sudanese militia leader who fought in a 22-year-old civil war alongside the Khartoum government, refused to turn in their weapons. Fifty people were killed in fighting. Last week: Already faced with the expected secession of its oil-rich south and charges of genocide against President Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's government began seeing signs of unrest. Police clashed with students in the capital Khartoum on Sunday as the protesters chanted, ""Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan together as one."" About 100 students hurled rocks at police officers, who pushed them back. The human rights group Amnesty International said more than 20 people still being held by police ""are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."" Lebanon . Observers say that if the country doesn't find a suitable end to its political turmoil, it could become a battleground between Iran and Syria on one side and pro-Western forces on the other. Attempts to form a new government have been complicated by a U.N. tribunal probing the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The tribunal is expected to implicate members of Hezbollah in the killing, which led the group to drop out of the government last month. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, this week said Arab regimes have been confronted by popular protest because of their alliances with the United States and Israel. Last week: Protests erupted in January as President Michel Suleiman appointed Najib Mikati, a Hezbollah-backed politician, as prime minister. Supporters of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri saw the move as a power grab by the Shiite movement that enjoys Iranian support and is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department. Hariri initially urged supporters to stage a ""day of rage"" and show restraint in protesting the appointment, but the demonstrations quickly grew ugly as gunshots were fired and his supporters burned tires and garbage containers in various cities. Algeria . In addition to a promise to lift a state of emergency, the government also cut taxes on sugar and cooking oil and increased the supply of wheat, Time magazine reports. The moves come after weeks of protests. The Algerian Press Service has reported that the government is also taking measures to bolster youth employment. Saad Djebbar, a London-based Algerian lawyer and political analyst, said he is skeptical. ""They want to produce some sort of trick that would show that reform is under way, like what Mubarak is doing in Egypt, who appears to be using all of the tricks in the book to avoid being removed,"" he said. Last week: Responding to unrest in the region, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said he would lift the state of emergency in effect for nearly 20 years, according to the Algerian Press Service. Last month, the country's largest opposition party called for demonstrations demanding the release of detainees and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms. Opponents blame the government for a spike in food prices and say the regime has failed to use Algeria's vast energy wealth to better the lives of ordinary people. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Steve Kastenbaum, Mohammed Jamjoom, Rima Maktabi, Josh Levs, Nic Robertson and Nada Husseini contributed to this report.","Jordan's king swears in a new government, including opposition members, newspaper editor .

"(CNN)  -- Mark Wilson claimed his second PGA Tour win of the season as he beat fellow American Jason Dufner at the second extra hole of a playoff to win the Phoenix Open Monday. Wilson drained an 10-foot birdie putt to edge out Dufner after both had finished tied on 18-under 266 in regulation play, the tournament held over after frost delayed proceedings Sunday. Wilson, who took the season-opening Sony Open is riding the crest of the wave with his fourth career PGA Tour win. ""This is the best golf I've every played in my life, I don't get down on myself and I've a good attitude right now,"" he told the Golf Channel. Wilson closed with a two-under 69 while Dufner went into the playoff after a fine 66 with birdies at the 16th and 18th as he chased his first Tour win. His victory completed a dream weekend for Wilson, who is a big fan of Super Bowl winners, the Green Bay Packers. ""I was a little more nervous today than I was expecting,"" he told the official PGA Tour website. ""I didn't sleep great last night.

"(CNN) -- Environmentalists and indigenous-rights supporters gathered in the Brazilian capital Tuesday to protest a hydroelectric dam project that they say would be devastating to the Amazon region. The demonstration, in front the congressional building in Brasilia, seeks to stop the construction of the Belo Monte dam, which they say would flood at least 400,000 hectares (nearly a million acres) of forest, displacing 40,000 indigenous people and other local residents, and destroying various species of wildlife and insects. The construction of the controversial reservoir -- a $17 billion project -- was authorized in January by Brazil's Environmental Institute. The contractors working on the dam, to be located on the Xingu River in Para state, have permission to clear 238 hectares of the forest, an area larger than Monaco. The protesters want to give Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff a petition signed by half a million people from around the world who criticize the project. The government argues that the hydroelectric dam, with a potential capacity of 11,000 megawatts, is needed to guarantee a supply of energy for a country that is growing economically. Set for completion in 2015, Belo Monte would be the second-largest dam in the country, behind Tucurui. Journalist Fabiana Frayssinet contributed to this report for CNN.","The Belo Monte hydroelectric dam would be the second-largest in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- A tractor-trailer clipped one bus carrying students back from a college visit and then struck another head-on, leaving three dead, Mississippi authorities said Tuesday. A teacher, school bus driver and the driver of the big rig died in the Tuesday afternoon incident near Calhoun City, authorities said. ""I've been doing this for 41 years and this is the worst wreck with this number of people I've seen,"" said Calhoun County Sheriff Billy Gore. ""It's troubling to see so many young kids so so frightened."" The school group was returning from a visit to the University of Mississippi, officials said. Mitchell Diggs, a spokesman for the University of Mississippi, said the group from Ackerman High School in Choctaw County was in Oxford for a typical admissions visit for seniors. The students later took a tour and had lunch before departing the campus around 1 p.m., Diggs said. About 60 children were on the buses, and 10 were transported to area hospitals after the 2:30 p.m. collision, officials said. One patient was airlifted, Gore said. The rest suffered mostly bumps and bruises, he said. The accident happened on state routes 8 and 9, which are combined for several miles. Footage provided by CNN affiliate WMC in Memphis, Tennessee, showed the damaged bus on a narrow bridge. The truck continued a few hundred yards before coming to a stop. Calhoun City is in north central Mississippi. The investigation is continuing.

"(CNN) -- Pirates in the Indian Ocean captured Saturday a general cargo ship and its 27-member Thai crew, the European Union Naval Force Somalia said. Twenty-five vessels and 601 hostages are now being held by pirates in the region, officials said in a statement. The Thai MV Thor Nexus was hijacked about 450 nautical miles northeast of the island of Socotra, officials said. The ship was on its way to Bangladesh from Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates. No details of the attack were known Saturday. Pirate attacks and subsequent ransoms have become a frequent hazard for sailors off Somalia, which has had no effective central government since 1991. Pirates on Monday hijacked another cargo ship, officials said. The attack happened about 400 nautical miles northeast of the Seychelles. At least four pirates, using two small boats and rocket-propelled grenades, boarded the MV Orna, a Panama-flagged merchant vessel owned by a United Arab Emirates company. The European Union Naval Force Somalia is a multinational task force with the mission to escort merchant vessels carrying humanitarian aid of the World Food Programme and vessels of the African Union Mission in Somalia.","Pirates hijack ship off Somali coast .

"(RollingStone.com) -- It's been almost a decade since Bright Eyes' ""Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground,"" the epic 2002 album that established Conor Oberst as the pain-strumming poet of emo and the newest of the New Dylans. But the 22-year-old hadn't asked for either gig. So Oberst spent the 2000s abjuring big statements, choosing to scale down his sound, bum around North America and try to figure himself out. ""I've taken some comfort . . . "" he sings on Bright Eyes' first album in nearly four years, ""knowing I don't have to be an exception."" The latest dispatch from Planet Conor weaves the weird knowledge he's accrued over the years into a rich, sprawling, fragmented record. It's got elements of the hazy synth rock of 2005's ""Digital Ash in a Digital Urn"" and echoes of his two recent, rootsy solo albums. But being Bright Eyes again mainly means a break from Solo Conor's rustic tranquility and a return to the bruised- angel indie rock of his earliest albums. Oberst brings it all back home by recording in his native Omaha with Bright Eyes' other two permanent members -- multi-instrumentalist Nate Walcott and producer Mike Mogis -- plus local pals from Cursive and the Faint. Gallery: Random Notes, Rock's Hottest Photos . Oberst's lyrics explore a mysticism he's been messing with since 2007's ""Cassadaga."" On ""A Machine Spiritual (In the 'People's Key'),"" he's a futurist seer, tweeting happily from the end of time: ""History bows and it steps aside/In the jungle there are columns of purple light/We are starting over."" The album is full of nods to Rastafarianism, including references to ""one love"" and Zion. Oberst says he loves reggae's symbolism and anti-imperialist spirit, and throughout ""People's Key"" he uses Rasta vibrations as an emotional power source.

Bright Eyes: King of Indie Rock . Giving a chunk of your record over to some random old-timer's bullshit is a classic Oberst move, a way of undercutting the aura of importance people have foisted on his music since he was in high school. It's especially shrewd because ""The People's Key"" contains some of his most weighty songwriting -- the head-clearing clamor of ""Haile Selassie"" or the somber ""Approximate Sunlight,"" where Oberst ruefully sings, ""It's been said we're post-everything."" His greatest quality is that he refuses to be post-anything. He manages to be everything at once: folkie and punk, old soul and eternal boy, high-plains drifter and hipster heartthrob.

"(Health.com) -- An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration  has recommended that devices used in electroconvulsive therapy ?also known as ""electroshock therapy""?should continue to be classified as high risk. The devices, which induce a seizure by delivering an electrical current to a patient's brain, are used to treat intractable cases of depression, as well as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. On Friday, a majority of experts on the panel expressed support for classifying ECT devices as high risk for the treatment of depression and several other conditions. Although the panel members ""weighed in,"" no formal vote was taken and none is expected, according to FDA spokesperson Karen Riley. FDA mulls future of electroshock therapy . If the FDA follows the panel's advice, as it usually does, the makers of ECT devices may need to provide the agency with additional safety and efficacy evidence, like that required for prescription drugs. ECT machines are currently in a high-risk category but have so far avoided the cumbersome FDA approval process thanks to a grandfather clause. Proponents of ECT were dismayed by the panel's assessment. Just two small companies in the U.S. make ECT devices, and some experts worry that neither will have the resources to conduct the studies that the FDA may require, which could ultimately restrict access to the treatment. ""It's going to be very unfortunate,"" says Helen Lavretsky, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at UCLA. ""It's going to disappear out of our practices. There are 100,000 people who undergo ECT in the U.S., and it won't be available to them."" Health.com: 10 myths about shock therapy . One of the device manufacturers, the Illinois-based company Somatics, declined to comment. Nancy Koenigsberg, the legal director of Disability Rights New Mexico, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, one of many patient advocacy groups that argued for stricter oversight of ECT devices in the lead-up to last week's meeting, says her organization was ""pleased"" with the outcome. ""We agree that the manufacturers of ECT devices should have to go through the [pre-market approval] process to show they are clinically safe and effective,"" Koenigsberg says. ""We hope the FDA takes the committee's advice."" Health.com: What ECT feels like . The FDA's official decision will not be made for at least a year, and doctors can continue to use ECT devices in the interim. Even if the agency requires manufacturers to seek approval for their products, the devices will remain in use during the approval process, Riley says. ""We're optimistic that this life-saving procedure will continue to be available as a treatment option for patients with debilitating illnesses,"" the president of the American Psychiatric Association, Carol Bernstein, M.D., said in a statement. The association supports reclassifying ECT devices as medium risk, which would preclude the need for additional research regarding their safety and effectiveness.

"(CNN) -- Police in northern Virginia charged Washington Redskins defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth with assault Saturday for punching a fellow motorist last week. Haynesworth, 29, was free to leave after signing the warrant and is scheduled to appear at the Fairfax County Criminal Court on March 31, the Fairfax County Police Department said. The charge stems from an allegation by an unnamed driver who said Haynesworth punched him February 2 while they were driving on the Fairfax County Parkway, police said. The motorist told police the driver of a pickup truck -- whom police later determined to be Haynesworth -- was tailgating him, so he delivered a ""nonverbal hand gesture"" to the driver, Officer Shelley Broderick said. The man told police that when the two stopped at a red light, Haynesworth got out of the truck and the two briefly exchanged words before Haynesworth threw a punch, according to Broderick. The man called police. After making a statement, he drove himself to a hospital for treatment of minor injuries, Broderick said. Police said officers interviewed Haynesworth on Saturday at the Reston District Police Station before he signed the warrant. Haynesworth's agent, Chad Speck, said last week it was the other driver who instigated the incident and called the accusation ""ridiculous."" In Virginia, simple assault is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 12 months in jail and a $2,500 fine.","Haynesworth allegedly punched a fellow motorist last week .

"(CNN)  -- Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti has backed his £50 million ($80.5 million) striker Fernando Torres to live up to his price tag after the Spain striker's disappointing debut against his former club Liverpool. Chelsea slumped to a 1-0 home defeat with Torres giving an ineffectual display on his debut at Stamford Bridge, being substituted just after the hour mark. Torres wasted a chance in the second minute and his partnership with Didier Drogba did not live up to the pre-match hype. But Ancelotti pleaded for patience, saying his new striker had been in training with his new teammates for just three days ahead of the English Premier League with Liverpool. ""Torres did a good job but we had difficulty to find space because Liverpool defended very well. They put three defenders in the middle and we couldn't attack them,"" Ancelotti told his club's official television channel. ""He has experience and confidence. He didn't show problems or nerves before the game. He was excited to play. We have to give him time to adjust to the shape. He will do it quickly."" The defeat leaves defending champions Chelsea still 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester United, with games running out but Ancelotti is hoping Torres and the other new signing, central defender David Luiz, will be up to the task. 'We have fantastic players with fantastic ability. It was a difficult game, obviously we are disappointed, but both Fernando Torres and David Luiz will be the future for this club,' Ancelotti added. Torres admitted that Liverpool's tactics of deploying three central defenders had proved effective. ""They played with three at the back and maybe we weren't expecting that,"" he told Chelsea TV. ""But we have to keep fighting to the end and there are a lot of points still to be won,"" he added. Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted by his team's performance in a fourth straight win but dismissed talk of Torres' departure being an extra incentive. ""I came here to get three points, whether Carlo Ancelotti was playing up front or anyone else doesn't matter. ""He (Torres) had one shot on target when Jamie Carragher did a fantastic block tackle but I'm not here to talk any somebody else's players,"" he told reporters. Liverpool have moved up to a season-high sixth in the standings after their superb recent run under Dalglish.","Carlo Ancelotti insists his new signing Fernando Torres will live up to $80m price tag .

"(CNN) -- The U.S.-based IndyCar motorsport series will have only one overseas race next year after organizers decided to drop Japan from the calendar. The Twin Ring Motegi circuit will host its final IndyCar event on September 18, having been the first international race to be added in 2003. ""As INDYCAR and the IZOD IndyCar Series continue to evaluate their long-term plans, we must look to build the sport and its viewership,"" commercial division president Terry Angstadt said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We believe it is important that the final few events on our schedule give us the opportunity to be broadcast live during times that maximize our viewing audience as we build up to the championship."" The decision means that Brazil's Sao Paulo Indy 300, held in May, will be the only race outside North America in 2012. Twin Ring Motegi opened in 1997 and is owned by Mobilityland, a subsidiary of Japanese car manufacturer Honda. It was the scene of Danica Patrick's historic first victory by a female driver in 2008, while overall series winners Dan Wheldon, Scott Dixon and Tony Kanaan have all triumphed there. Motegi, which is the only oval track in Japan, also hosts motorcycling's top class, MotoGP. ""After having played host to the event for so many years with all the support and help from the people concerned, we have decided, albeit regrettably, that it is extremely difficult for the company to keep hosting a round of IndyCar Series in the face of the on-going business environment,"" Mobilityland president Hiroshi Oshima told the IndyCar website. ""While it is indeed a pity to have to put a stop to the event that has been developed together with the local community, we are now set to move ahead and promote future events and motorsport programs by building on our past 13 years of experience and know-how gained from the American motorsport with its trademark spirit of challenge.""","Japan's Twin Ring Motegi circuit will not host an IndyCar race in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal was glowing with pride after winning the prestigious Laureus Sportsman of the Year award, following in the footsteps of his greatest tennis rival Roger Federer. The Spaniard was honored along with American skier Lindsey Vonn, who won the top women's prize at a ceremony in Abu Dhabi on Monday. ""It is very important (in terms of) personal satisfaction,"" the nine-time grand slam winner told CNN's Pedro Pinto. ""This nomination is voted for by the world of sport ... the best sportsmen and sportswomen in the world voted for me, it's a real honor. It was an emotional season for me, probably the most emotional of my career, so thank you very much for everyone who made this possible for me."" Federer won the men's award four successive times until champion sprinter Usain Bolt reigned in 2009 and 2010, but Nadal took this year's gong after reclaiming his world No. 1 ranking and winning three of the four tennis grand slam events. The 24-year-old, who won the best newcomer category in 2006,  headed off footballers Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta, Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel, basketball star Kobe Bryant and boxer Manny Pacquaio. He said he was looking forward to returning to action after a leg injury effectively ended his hopes of completing a grand slam at the Australian Open last month. ""For me, the most important thing is not being No. 1 but to be healthy and keep being competitive in every tournament I play,"" Nadal said. It was a big night for Spain as the country's 2010 World Cup-winning footballers took out the team award, while German golfer Martin Kaymer claimed the sporting breakthrough prize and Kelly Slater notched a second U.S. success as he won the action sports category for the third time. Kaymer's compatriot, visually-impaired skier and biathlete Verena Bentele, won the sportsperson with a disability award while motorcycle champion Valentino Rossi was honored for best comeback achievement. French football legend Zinedine Zidane received a lifetime achievement award, while Europe's Ryder Cup-winning team -- which featured Kaymer -- won the spirit of sport prize. The 26-year-old Vonn won the top award for the first time after a year in which she won gold and bronze medals at the Winter Olympics in Canada and a third consecutive overall World Cup title. The most successful U.S. woman skier of all-time, she triumphed ahead of three-time winner Serena Williams, her compatriot's fellow tennis stars Kim Clijsters and Caroline Wozniacki, and athletes Jessica Ennis and Blanka Vlasic. Spain's football team continued the trend that has seen the FIFA World Cup holders triumph every time since the award's inception in 2000, this time heading off treble-winning club side Inter Milan, the Ryder Cup golfers, Bryant's NBA champions the LA Lakers, Vettel's all-conquering Red Bull outfit and rugby's New Zealand All Blacks. Kaymer, who was crowned Europe's No. 1 and has risen to second in the world rankings, was honored ahead of fellow golfers Louis Oosthuizen and Matteo Manassero, Germany World Cup star Thomas Muller and French athletes Christophe Lemaitre and Teddy Tamgho. Rossi recovered from a broken leg to return to the track in just 41 days, but could not add to his seven world MotoGP titles. The Italian won the comeback award from tennis star Justine Henin, athletes Carolina Kluft, Tyson Gay and Merlene Ottey, plus U.S. golfer Paula Creamer. Bentele triumphed ahead of fellow Paralympic star Lauren Woolstencroft of Canada, who also won five gold medals in Vancouver last year, skier Jakub Krako, swimmers Matt Cowdrey and Daniel Dias, plus wheelchair tennis star Esther Vergeer, a two-time winner. Slater, who won a record 10th world title in 2010, headed off nominees including Australian women's surfing star Stephanie Gilmore, last year's winner who like the American has also been shortlisted eight times.","Rafael Nadal and Lindsey Vonn win top Laureus awards for the first time .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan and India have agreed to resume peace talks that broke down after the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, government ministries said Thursday. ""(Pakistani) Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani has expressed his satisfaction on the important decision taken both by Pakistan and India to resume full spectrum of dialogue,"" said a statement from Pakistan's foreign ministry. An announcement from India's external affairs ministry said the foreign minister of Pakistan will visit India by July to ""review progress in the dialogue process."" Dates for the talks have not yet been set. The decision to resume peace talks came during weekend meetings in Bhutan between the foreign secretaries of each nation. ""I value this development and pay my compliments and good wishes to (Indian Prime Minister) Dr. Manmohan Singh,"" Gilani said. Nirupama Rao, India's foreign secretary, said the talks will focus on a range of issues, such as terrorism and humanitarian, economic and water-related matters. ""There are no overnight solutions and we need time, we need patience to resolve many of these issues. So we're not raising high expectations,"" she told CNN Thursday. ""We're not setting overambitious objectives. But this is a re-engagement, and we have to hope for the best."" Under U.S. pressure, leaders from the nuclear neighbors held several meetings last year in a bid to restart the peace process, but no dramatic headway had been made until recently in resolving outstanding issues. The two countries have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. The Himalayan territory of Kashmir -- claimed by both -- has been the cause of two of those conflicts. In 2004, India and Pakistan agreed to a peace process that covers eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side, which it sees as a threat to its water supplies. Successive governments on both sides have held talks in an attempt to end their historical acrimony. Singh and Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari hailed results from the negotiations in September 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings. But talks were suspended two months later, in November, 2008, after the terror raid on Mumbai. CNN's Reza Sayah, Sara Sidner and Harmeet Singh contributed to this report.","Peace talks broke down after the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan will consider a plea deal on the charge that she stole a necklace from a jewelry store if she can avoid going to jail, her lawyer said Thursday. Attorney Shawn Chapman Holley insisted, though, that the grand theft charge is ""entirely defensible."" The actress entered a not guilty plea in the case Wednesday before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Keith Schwartz, but the judge immediately revoked her probation related to a 2007 drunk driving conviction. ""Ms. Lohan maintains her innocence, and now that I've seen the police reports, I believe the case is entirely defensible,"" Holley said. ""Having said that, we will entertain a discussion concerning a plea if it means no jail so that she can move forward with her recovery and her career."" Lohan was allowed to post bond on the theft charge and the probation revocation after a short hearing Wednesday. Schwartz will hold a hearing February 23 to decide if the theft charge warrants sending Lohan back to jail immediately on a probation violation. The court date will also be used to consider a possible negotiated resolution to the theft charge, he said. At the arraignment Wednesday, Schwartz warned Lohan that she could be put back in jail if she violates the law. ""Please don't push your luck, I am telling you,"" the judge said. ""Things will be different."" The theft charge filed Wednesday comes five weeks after the actress was released from court-ordered drug rehabilitation and less than three weeks before a judge said he might free her from supervised probation from the drunken driving conviction. Lohan was smiling at times as she sat at the defense table before the arraignment. She wore a tight-fitting white dress, with her long blond hair loosely tied in the back. Lohan wore what appeared to be several diamond bracelets on her right arm, complemented by diamond earrings and a large diamond-filled ring on her right hand. The 24-year-old actress allegedly walked out of the Venice, California, store with the necklace on January 22, a statement from the district attorney's office said. ""The owner reported the theft to the Los Angeles Police Department, which investigated the allegation and presented evidence to the D.A.'s office last week."" The necklace was handed over to police just before they were to execute a search warrant to look for the jewelry in Lohan's Venice apartment last week, police said. Under California's grand theft law, prosecutor Danette Meyers must prove that Lohan intended to steal the jewelry and that she carried it away from the store. The penalty for a felony grand theft conviction ranges from 16 months to three years in a California state prison, varying based on the value of the property stolen and the criminal record of the defendant. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. The store owner claims the ""one of a kind"" necklace is worth $2,500, police said. The judge could reduce the charge to a misdemeanor, which would carry a prison sentence of no more than one year. Lohan is on supervised probation for a drunken driving conviction. The judge overseeing that case told her in October that he would send her to jail for 180 days if she violated her probation rules before her next court appearance, set for February 25. That court date is now off, with Judge Schwartz taking over Lohan's legal cases. She left the Betty Ford clinic a month ago after three months in a drug rehabilitation program. The rehab stint persuaded the judge not to send Lohan to jail for failing a drug test.","The theft charge is ""entirely defensible,"" Lohan's lawyer says .

"Gaborone, Botswana (CNN) -- Botswana has joined the international community in commending the Egyptian people for the largely peaceful manner in which they brought about the ouster of long-time leader Hosni Mubarak. The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Botswana noted in a news release the Egyptian military's pledges for a peaceful transition to democratic rule anchored on free and fair elections as well as freedom of expression and association. Nevertheless, Botswana expressed some reservations about the military takeover of the government for the next six months or until the elections are held. ""We are, however, concerned that the military is in charge of such transition, which in our view is not the best arrangement,"" the news release says. Botswana says it is hopeful that the military will exit the political scene as soon as possible to allow a democratic process to take place. The land-locked Southern African country further calls on the international community to spare no effort in working with the current leadership in Egypt to bring about meaningful change, in line with the wishes and aspirations, it says, of ordinary men and women who sacrificed their time, comforts and even lives to usher in a new era in their country.

"(CNN) -- More than 500 veterans in Ohio are being contacted by a clinic where they may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV during routine dental work, according to Ohio Veterans Affairs communications officer Todd Sledge. The Dayton, Ohio, VA clinic is contacting 535 veterans who received treatment during an 18-year period from a dentist who admitted to not washing his hands or changing gloves between patients. There are 100 to 130 additional patient records still to review, according to Sledge. ""We're taking a very aggressive approach and a well-planned intervention to make sure that we're contacting these folks,"" Sledge said. By Tuesday evening, 436 of the 535 patients had been contacted by phone, letters and visits to shelters, according to Sledge. Individuals sought by the center are known to have been treated directly by the clinician between January 1, 1992, and July 28, 2010, according to a release by the medical center. The center is offering free tests to those involved and the clinic will provide all necessary care and treatment without charge should a veteran test positive for the viruses, Sledge said. ""The encouragement to get tested is strictly a precautionary measure,"" Sledge said. ""It's a very low risk that there's any potential contamination."" While Sledge said the testing stemmed from ""invasive procedures ... done by one single clinician,"" He did not identify that clinician and he did not release specifics about the clinician's health. Sledge said the clinic is taking full accountability for those involved, whom he calls, ""our nation's heroes."" Last year the clinic closed for a month for ""re-education on infection control standards"" for the staff, Sledge said. Veterans could still receive care at other facilities, Sledge said. The dentist, who is currently still on staff but handling non-clinical duties, self-reported himself during an internal inspection. An investigation is now underway involving reports that other workers at the clinic brought the dentist's hygiene to the attention of the center, concerns that Sledge said were valid. The center is taking an ""ongoing in-depth look at a lot of aspects surrounding the allegations,"" Sledge said. ""When someone brings those things to your attention,"" Sledge said, ""you need to review what practices are happening.""

"(CNN) -- Making the catch was never a life or death matter for Jeff Bryant until a baby dropped from a burning apartment building in a Portland, Oregon, suburb fell into his hands Saturday morning. If Bryant had failed, the boy would have landed on a concrete parking lot. As it was, the child and his mother survived, but two other sons of the mother died in the blaze. Bryant discovered the Milwaukie apartment building was on fire as he walked out the door of his nearby residence around 9:30 a.m. ""I could hear buzzers and saw black smoke as I walked down the alley,"" Bryant told CNN. ""Then I saw a woman hanging out of a fourplex holding a baby in her hands."" Without hesitating, Bryant dumped the coffee cup he was carrying, ran to the building and yelled at the woman to drop the baby to him, he said. ""Are you sure you'll catch him?"" Bryant recalled the woman shouted at him. ""Of course I will,"" Bryant said he replied. ""I knew for a fact that I was not going to drop that baby."" Bryant, who played basketball in the eighth grade, said he wasn't thinking about snagging a rebound. ""It had nothing to do with my hands, it had to with coordination,"" Bryant said. That, said Bryant, and, ""I pictured one of my own children hanging out that window."" The woman, whom authorities identified as Kimberly Hasty, 24, then dropped her 1-year-old son, Wani Lemi, into Bryant's arms. Bryant then ran to the far side of the parking lot to get the child away from the intense heat. Hasty then jumped out of the second-story window of her apartment. Bryant wrapped Wani in a quilt a friend brought to him. He said he then told others who arrived at the scene to take Hasty away from the burning building. ""I was worried the windows were going to explode,"" Bryant said. ""Which they did."" Bryant said the flames were so large they threatened other buildings in the complex, including his own. Bryant said he then told his wife and two children to get out of their apartment. Clackamas Fire District 1 spokesman Steve McAdoo said it took three minutes for firefighters to respond to the blaze. By the time they arrived, the baby and his mother had been rescued and the apartment was engulfed in flames. Two of her other sons -- 4-year-old Ladu Lemi and Appolo Lemi, 5 -- died after firefighters pulled them from the burning apartment building. An autopsy by the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office found that the boys had died of smoke inhalation. McAdoo said that had Bryant not been there, the blaze could easily have killed all four family members. Hasty and her surviving son were listed in stable critical condition at a nearby hospital, authorities said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Bryant was reluctant to accept being called a hero. ""I just thought it was the correct thing to do,"" he said. ""If it was me and my child, I would hope a passerby would do the same thing for me.""","NEW: Victims of Portland-area blaze identified .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier remained huddled inside his hotel Monday, as the reasons behind his unexpected return to Haiti and what he hopes to accomplish there remain unclear. Duvalier returned to his homeland Sunday after some 25 years in exile, injecting a further dose of uncertainty into an already turbulent political situation. A news conference at his hotel Monday was canceled at the last minute because the space was not equipped to handle the crowd, and no other location could be found, Henry Robert Sterlin, a Duvalier associate, told reporters. Sterlin said that the former dictator had returned because he was moved by the anniversary of last year's tragic earthquake and because he missed his homeland. ""He's deeply hurt in his soul after the earthquake. He wanted to come back to see how is the actual Haitian situation -- of the people and of the country,"" Sterlin said about Duvalier. He said he did not know how long the former leader was planning to stay. Duvalier's arrival in Haiti coincides with an ongoing political crisis there, sparked by fraud allegations in a presidential election. A runoff vote, scheduled for January 16, was postponed after a contested first round. Human rights groups urged Haiti to arrest and prosecute the former dictator. ""Duvalier's return to Haiti should be for one purpose only: to face justice,"" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director of Human Rights Watch. ""Under the presidency of Duvalier ... thousands were killed and tortured, and hundreds of thousands of Haitians fled into exile. His time to be held accountable is long overdue."" Amnesty International similarly said Duvalier should be brought to justice. ""The widespread and systematic human rights violations committed in Haiti during Duvalier's rule amount to crimes against humanity,"" said Javier Zuniga, special adviser at Amnesty International. ""Haiti is under the obligation to prosecute him and anyone else responsible for such crimes."" The Duvalier family ruled Haiti for three decades, starting in 1957 when Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier was elected president. He later declared himself president for life. When he died in 1971, he was succeeded by his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier. The younger Duvalier held onto power for 15 years before a revolt forced him to flee the country. Widely accused of corruption, Duvalier has been living in France. He has maintained some support in Haiti. At the offices of the National Unity Party, a few dozen of his supporters gathered around a television to listen to news reports. ""President Jean-Claude Duvalier, by coming back into the country it is a victory for Haiti,"" said Jean Etienne, an engineering student. ""When President Jean-Claude Duvalier was in the country, it wasn't like it is now. It was better."" The former dictator is at the Karibe Hotel in Petionville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince. He arrived there Sunday night. ""There's definite energy in the air right now,"" said Ryan Flaherty, head of security for Project Medishare. ""Right now, people don't know what he's back here for. People don't know if he is just visiting, or if he's here to talk about the earthquake and relief ... or, is he going to make a political move?"" said Flaherty. ""It's just going to be interesting to hear what he has to say."" Sunday, the United Nations restricted the movement of its staff in Port-au-Prince until further notice, or until the effects of the former leader's arrival becomes clear, said Patrick Hanson, a security officer for the United Nations in Haiti. While groups of people were gathered in various parts of the city, they are calm and no violence has been reported, he said. The United States likewise said it was caught off guard by Duvalier's unexpected return. ""We are surprised by the timing of Duvalier's visit to Haiti. It adds unpredictability at an uncertain time in Haiti's election process,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said in a tweet. Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council released preliminary election results in early December that showed former first lady Mirlande Manigat with 31.4% of the vote. Jude Celestin, President Rene Preval's handpicked successor, came in second with 22.3%, while popular musician Michel Martelly was third with 21.8%. However, a review of the results conducted by an Organization of American States monitoring team showed Martelly winning 22.2% of the vote to Celestin's 21.9%, affording Martelly a spot in a runoff election with Manigat. Haiti's constitution mandates a new presidential term starting on February 7, but it is unclear whether that will happen. Efforts to elect a new president are unfolding as the country is still struggling to rebuild after last year's devastating earthquake. Last week, Haiti marked the first anniversary of that quake, which left more than 200,000 people dead. Agnes Pierre-Louis, a local business owner, said Haitians are anxiously waiting to see what the government will do next, now that Duvalier has returned. So far, Preval's administration has remained silent. ""There are so many parties here and so many mixed feelings that it's really hard to know who to turn to at the moment,"" she said. ""We don't know what the next week or the next couple of days will bring.""

"(RollingStone.com) -- When Sam Beam stepped into the spotlight on Iron and Wine's 2002 debut, he was a novelty act. That acoustic guitar, that soothingly sweet tenor voice, that flowing mountain-man beard? Pop music hadn't seen anything like it since the heyday of Cat Stevens. But Beam's songs -- sincere folk churners full of backwoods beauty and subtle psychedelia -- had a weird magic all their own. Since then, indie rock has been overrun by extravagantly bearded, achingly earnest balladeers, but Beam started running away from the pack on 2007's ""The Shepherd's Dog,"" which juiced limpid melodies with dashes of Appalachian folk and West African rock.

Now, on ""Kiss Each Other Clean,"" Beam has gone pop -- at least the kind of pop you might have heard on a free-form radio station occupied by a band of hippie visionaries in 1971. Beam's lovely voice anchors melodies of crystalline clarity and unshakable catchiness. But the music won't stay still, moving from stormy psychedelic rock (""Rabbit Will Run"") to white-guy funk (""Big Burned Hand"") to what sounds like a Beach Boys version of a country-western ballad (""Half Moon""). Beam's tunes pull you merrily along, but his songs don't shy from the big issues, tackling war, politics and sex.

"(CNN) -- The stadium at the heart of the 2012 London Olympics is set to be transformed into a football ground once the Games have finished, after English Premier League side West Ham were named as the preferred future residents of the venue on Friday. The 80,000 capacity stadium will replace nearby Upton Park as West Ham's home but will retain its capability to host athletics events thanks to a commitment from the east London club to keep the running track in place. The decision ends a period of jostling between West Ham and -- Premier League and London rivals -- Tottenham Hotspur, who were also hoping to relocate to the arena after the Olympics. Spurs proposed rebuilding a 60,000-seater, football-only venue on the same site but the plan failed to convince the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) who decide on the future use of the location. ""We have made a unanimous recommendation to back West Ham as the long-term tenant,"" OPLC chairwoman Margaret Ford said at a press conference. ""This represents the very best legacy for the stadium and for the communities of east London, and is a really good outcome for sport,"" she added. The British government still have to finalise the confirmation of West Ham as tenants, but it is expected that they will do do in the coming weeks. The soccer club maintained it was their promise, to retain the stadium's running track in line with the policy of 2012 organizers to leave an athletic legacy in the area, that helped clinch the decision. ""Today is a momentous day. We are proud to have been passed the Olympic torch and fully embrace the responsibility we have for keeping the flame alive,"" the club's vice chairman Karen Brady told their official website. ""We have been working on this project for some time now and are just at the starting line of the race to make this a stadium that will really make the nation proud."" The news is a blow for fifth-placed top flight side Tottenham, who had wished to expand beyond their current facilities at White Hart Lane, with the financial help of American entertainment firm AEG. ""The Olympic Stadium site is an essential element in the creation of a viable Olympic Park and we know that we provided a first class proposal to support the sustainability of the whole project,"" a statement on their website read. Should the move become official, however, it is not the first time a Premier League club will have taken over an athletics stadium. Manchester City moved from their Maine Road ground to the City of Manchester Stadium -- the venue for the 2002 Commonwealth Games -- to capitalise on its 48,000 all-seater facilities. Elsewhere in Europe, Barcelona's 1992 Olympic Stadium was La Liga side Espanyol's home ground from 1997 to 2009, while Serie A club's Lazio and Roma share the use of Rome's 1960 Stadio Olympico. And in Berlin the 74, 500 capacity Olympicstadion -- built for the Olympics held in the city in 1936 -- is home to German second division side Hertha BSC. It also played host to matches in the 1974 and 2006 World Cups.","West Ham are confirmed favorites to take over London Olympic stadium .

"(CNN) -- Argentina FA president Julio Grondona has spoken about Carlos Tevez's absence from Sergio Batista's squad that faced Portugal on Wednesday, claiming it was a disciplinary measure. Media reports speculated that Tevez was omitted from the side that beat Portugal 2-1 in Switzerland as a favor to his club side Manchester City, ahead of this weekend's crucial Premier League derby against Manchester United. But Grondona admitted to a radio station that Tevez was left out as a punishment for his attitude in missing last year's friendly against Brazil in Doha, only to play for City against Fulham just four days later -- scoring twice in the match. Grondona told Radio Pop: ""Tevez's absence was because of his attitude when he didn't come to play against Brazil and shortly after this he took the field for his club. ""That attitude didn't go down well with the coaching staff, it was a lot easier to tell us that he didn't want to come."" However, Grondona was quick to point out that Tevez was not left out because of his close friendship with former Argentina manager Diego Maradona. ""Tevez's absence has nothing to do with Maradona, we cannot go down that road,'' he added. ''I want to leave that crystal clear.""","Argentina FA president speaks out about Carlos Tevez's absence to face Portugal .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Candidates wound up a flurry of election campaigning before a midnight deadline Friday night amid reports of a violent attack on one of the candidates' campaigns. The campaign of flamboyant komba-singer-turned-presidential-candidate Michel ""Sweet Micky"" Martelly issued a statement late Friday night, claiming he had survived an ""assassination attempt"" in the town of Les Cayes in southern Haiti. ""Many wounded, at least one dead,"" the campaign said in a press release. Haitian police officials have not responded to phone calls from CNN. A spokesman for the United Nations confirmed to CNN there had been a clash in Les Cayes late Friday night, though he could not say whether there were casualties involved. ""It's a confrontation between Martelly partisans and the (supporters) of another Inité senator,"" Jean-Francois Vezina, a spokesman for the United Nations police detachment in Haiti, told CNN Saturday. Inite (Unity) is a well-funded political party endorsed by outgoing President Rene Preval. Its presidential candidate, Jude Celestin, leads the largest block of candidates for seats in both houses of parliament, which are also up for grabs in Sunday's election. ""The security guard of the Inite party used a weapon,"" Vezina said.  ""The only thing that we've done there is to send a Senegalese Force Police Unit to take control of the election there."" Tensions have mounted in Haiti ahead of Sunday's national elections, scheduled to be held within a year that saw a massive earthquake, a spreading cholera epidemic and recurring signs of government instability. Eighteen candidates are running for the post of president. Seats are also up for grabs in the Senate and in the lower house of parliament. Nearly all of the candidates have campaigned on similar platforms -- fighting corruption, creating jobs, and addressing a series of natural disasters that has left the Caribbean nation reeling and prompted many to urge for a postponement of Sunday's vote. Haitian elections have been historically troubled by violence as well as allegations of fraud and intimidation and the run-up to Sunday's vote has not been peaceful. Last Monday, clashes erupted between supporters of two rival candidates in another southern town, resulting in at least two deaths. ""Tempers are flaring, there is some political discontent,"" said Bernice Roberts, senior Haiti analyst with the International Crisis Group. ""There is a perpetual crisis of confidence among political actors. Plus there's a high level of social frustration regarding the response to the earthquake, regarding the response to cholera."" According to Haiti's Ministry of Public Health, more than 1,600 people have died as a result of the cholera epidemic that was first discovered on the island last month. More than 60,000 people have been treated for the deadly bacteria. Religious leaders, meanwhile, have been calling for calm ahead of the vote. ""We are praying for peace on election day,"" said Max Beauvoir, Haiti's ""Supreme Servitor,"" or highest ranking voodoo priest, in an interview with CNN on Friday. Haitian authorities are imposing strict measures to ensure security on election day. After midnight Saturday, only drivers with special passes from the Conseil Electoral Provisoir, Haiti's main electoral body, will be able to operate cars or motorcycles anywhere on Haiti's roadways, according to CEP spokesman Richardson Dumel. Businesses are also banned from selling alcohol from 8 p.m. Saturday until Monday, he said.  Gun licenses are also temporarily suspended from Saturday night until Monday.","U.N. confirms clash between campaign supporters .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney's stunning overhead kick was enough to give Manchester United a 2-1 win over arch rivals Manchester City in the English Premier League on Saturday. Rooney's strike, only his fifth league goal of the season, means Alex Ferguson's team extend their lead over their neighbors to eight points with a game in hand on Roberto Mancini's side. United took the lead at Old Trafford through Nani on the stroke of halftime. The Portugal winger beat Pablo Zabaleta before calmly slotting the ball past goalkeeper Joe Hart. City equalized after 65 minutes when substitute Edin Dzeko saw his shot deflect off Spanish teammate David Silva and spin into the back of the net. Has Rooney joined football's immortals? But it was the home team who would claim all three points after England striker Rooney acrobatically rifled home Nani's looping cross with only 12 minutes remaining. Second-placed Arsenal remain four points behind United after a 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Emirates Stadium. Dutch striker Robin van Persie continued his impressive recent form by scoring a goal in each half as Arsene Wenger's team extended their lead over third-placed City to four points. West Ham recovered from being 3-0 down at halftime to rescue a draw away at relegation rivals West Bromwich Albion. West Ham overtake EPL rivals Tottenham . The home team appointed former Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson as successor to the sacked Roberto di Matteo on Friday. Roberto Di Matteo sacked as West Brom manager . Hodgson watched from the stands as Graham Dorrans, Jerome Thomas and a Winston Reid own-goal saw West Brom take control of the opening 45 minutes. Former Hoffenheim striker Demba Ba pulled one back for the Hammers just after the interval, before England's Carlton Cole scored his eighth goal of the season to make the score 3-2. The comeback was completed with seven minutes left when Senegal forward Ba swept home a cross to score his second goal and West Ham's third. The points lifted West Ham off the bottom of the table, while West Brom remained just above the relegation zone in 17th place. Tottenham Hotspur moved into fourth position after coming from behind to beat Sunderland 2-1 at the Stadium of Light. Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan gave Steve Bruce's team the lead after he turned to fire a powerful, low shot past Brazilian goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes. Tottenham pulled level when Sunderland keeper Craig Gordon allowed Michael Dawson's header to squirm between his legs and into the back of the net. For the second week in a row, Croatia midfielder Niko Kranjcar proved to be Tottenham's match-winner when he found the target with a sweetly-struck volley after 57 minutes. The result saw the North London outfit climb above reigning champions Chelsea, who play Fulham on Monday. Liverpool's run of four consecutive league wins came to an end with a 1-1 draw against Wigan Athletic at Anfield. Portugal midfielder Raul Meireles gave Kenny Dalglish's side a first-half lead with his fourth goal in the last five matches. But Roberto Martinez's side grabbed a point when Ivorian defender Steve Gohouri prodded the ball into the net from an Antolin Alcaraz flick-on. Blackpool came from a goal down to earn a 1-1 draw at home to Gerard Houllier's Aston Villa. Forward Gabriel Agbonlahor gave Villa the lead on 10 minutes after being released by England striker Darren Bent. The visitors' lead lasted only four minutes after Elliot Grandin's near-post header gave Ian Holloway's team an equalizer. Villa finished the match with 10 men after Cameroon midfielder Jean Makoun was given a red card for a dangerous tackle on DJ Campbell. Birmingham City further eased their relegation worries with a 1-0 win over Stoke City. Serbia striker Nikola Zigic grabbed a stoppage-time goal to hand the Blues a second successive league win.

"(InStyle.com) -- Is there anything as romantic as a classic big screen kiss? Even today -- when most Hollywood movies don't exactly fade to black after the lovers lock lips -- the best kisses still have the power to send shivers down the spine. In honor of Valentine's Day, InStyle chose the most memorable cinematic embraces: upside down, on a boat, and in the pouring rain. ""Gone with the Wind"" ""You need kissing badly,"" Clark Gable, as Rhett Butler, told Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara in this 1939 epic. ""You should be kissed, and often.

""Lady and the Tramp"" She was the original uptown girl; he was a lovable drifter. But when these two crazy pups came together over a very long piece of spaghetti in this 1955 animated film, it was forever. ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" Truman Capote's original 1958 novella wasn't exactly a love story, so the author was less than thrilled with the 1961 big screen adaptation. (For one thing, he'd wanted Marilyn Monroe to play Holly Golightly.) But audiences adored this stylish film, particularly for the final scene, in which Holly (Audrey Hepburn) and Paul (George Peppard) make a rainy New York City alley seem as romantic as any pink-streaked sunset. InStyle.com: The most stylish celebrity couples . ""When Harry Met Sally"" This 1989 comedy made numerous witty contributions to the romantic lexicon -- and kickstarted a (still-raging) debate as to whether men and women could ""really"" be friends -- but it was the pair's New Year's Eve reconciliation that moved viewers to tears. As Billy Crystal (Harry) told Meg Ryan (Sally): ""I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."" ""Pretty Woman"" ""I don't kiss on the mouth,"" Vivian (Julia Roberts) warns Edward (Richard Gere) at the beginning of this 1990 movie. So when she does, it's pivotal -- the audience understands that she's come to regard Edward as much more than a client.

""Titanic"" Director James Cameron initially planned to cast ""an Audrey Hepburn type"" to play the female lead in this 1997 epic, and Leonardo DiCaprio nearly turned down his role. It's still captivating to see him woo Kate Winslet's Rose, even if, as DiCaprio said in a recent interview, kissing Kate is ""like kissing a family member.""

"(CNN) -- A 2-year-old boy and his mother have been found dead inside a Massachusetts trash bin, leaving authorities Monday to track down whomever killed the two and put them there. Police discovered Maria Avelina Palaguachi-Cela, 25, and her toddler son Brian Palaguachi dead in the large metal bin Sunday night in the city of Brockton, about 25 miles south of Boston. Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz did not identify any suspects in the pair's killings Monday, though he did say their deaths are not a ""random act."" ""We do not believe (there) is a general threat to public safety and the community,"" Cruz told reporters. ""However, this investigation is focusing on an individual who has murdered a mother and her young child."" The investigation began Sunday around 9:30 p.m. when Brockton police got an anonymous call about a body inside a bin behind the building where Palaguachi-Cela lived. The woman's body was found first, and the boy's body was found sometime later. Authorities told the public the boy was dead only after getting confirmation from the state medical examiner's office Monday, according to the district attorney. He said it was his understanding that both bodies ""are fully intact."" ""We wanted to make sure that we had all the information that was necessary prior to making sure that we had another body,"" Cruz said, explaining the delay in announcing that the toddler, too, was found dead. Brian was Palaguachi-Cela's only child living in the United States, according to the district attorney, who added that ""she does have another child in another country."" He did not say where that other child was, where Palaguachi-Cela was from originally, or if immigration authorities are involved in the investigation. The mother was last seen Thursday at her home, Cruz said. Others lived at her residence, though authorities have not revealed who else lived there, and the initial investigation is focusing on relatives and friends of the victims. A neighbor of the victims, Denise Agnello, told CNN affiliate WHDH that the killings -- and the fact the bodies had been disposed of in a Dumpster -- were shocking. ""I was horrified because I've lived here for 11 years, and nothing like this has ever happened,"" Agnello said. ""That's horrendous."" Their bodies Monday were sent to the state medical examiner in Boston, who will determine the cause and manner of their deaths. The trash bin has also been moved from the scene so it can be more thoroughly examined. While no one is yet in custody, the district attorney described the investigation as ""very active."" The gruesome nature of the discovery, he said, added a special urgency and sense of determination. ""Who would do that to a 2-year-old child?""

"(CNN) -- La Liga leaders Barcelona needed a late goal from David Villa on Saturday to rescue a 1-1 draw away at Sporting Gijon. Josep Guardiola's side had been on a record-breaking 16-match winning streak prior to their stalemate at El Molinon stadium. The reigning Spanish champions fell behind on 15 minutes thanks to a superb solo-strike from Sporting's David Barral. Barral, 27, slipped past Gerard Pique before he cut inside Diego Milito and fired a low shot across Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes and into the corner of the net. Barcelona trailed until the 80th minute, when Argentina's Lionel Messi released striker Villa. The Spanish World Cup winner saw Sporting goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar off his line and executed a delicate chip from 20 yards out which sailed into the goal.

"(CNN) -- You've heard of hybrids, electric cars and vehicles that can run on vegetable oil. But of all the contenders in the quest to produce the ultimate fuel-efficient car, this could be the first one to let you say, ""fill it up with air."" The compressed air car planned for the U.S. market would be a six-seater, a New York company says. That's the idea behind the compressed air car, which backers say could achieve a fuel economy of 106 miles per gallon. Plenty of skepticism exists, but with many Americans trying to escape sticker shock at the gas pump, the concept is generating buzz. The technology has been the focus of MDI, a European company founded in 1991 by a French inventor and former race car engineer. New York-based Zero Pollution Motors is the first firm to obtain a license from MDI to produce the cars in the United States, pledging to deliver the first models in 2010 at a price tag of less than $18,000. The concept is similar to how a locomotive works, except compressed air -- not steam -- moves the engine's pistons, said Shiva Vencat, vice president of MDI and CEO of Zero Pollution Motors. Gas still plays a role . The six-seater planned for the U.S. market would be able to reach speeds of more than 90 mph and have a range of more than 800 miles thanks to a dual energy engine, Vencat said.  Watch what a prototype looks like and why the cars may take off in cities » . The design calls for one or more tanks of compressed air under the car's floor, as well as a tank holding at least 8 gallons of fuel. Whether the engine uses just air or both air and fuel would depend on how fast the car is going. It would run purely on compressed air at speeds less than 35 mph, Vencat said. Since the car could only go a short distance when using just air, fuel is needed to get the full range, he explained. ""Above 35 mph, there is an external combustion system, which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air,"" Vencat said. ""Heating the air increases its volume, and by increasing its volume, it increases [the car's] range. That's why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg.""  See what the engine looks like » . Vencat said an on-board compressor would refill the air tank while the car is running, or owners could refill it by plugging it into a power outlet for four hours. Is it for real? Experts aren't sure Americans will be zipping around in air cars and getting 106 mpg, or more than twice the fuel economy of hybrid-electric vehicles such as the Toyota Prius. It is possible to power a car with compressed air, but the mileage claim is ""at the edge of possibility,"" said John Callister, director of the Harvey Kinzelberg Entrepreneurship in Engineering program at Cornell University's College of Engineering. He noted that such dramatic fuel efficiency is associated with tiny experimental cars, not bigger mainstream ones. ""No one's really proven a six-seater passenger car [can get] any better than 75 miles to the gallon. So this would represent a big step forward,"" Callister said. ""They would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the Prius."" Another expert expressed concern about the amount of energy it would take to generate the required air pressure: 4,500 pounds per square inch, or more than 120 times the pressure inside the tires of a typical four-door sedan. ""That is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting,"" said William Bulpitt, senior research engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology's Strategic Energy Institute. ""That takes quite a compressor to do. ... It takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure."" If you count that energy, it's hard to believe the car would be that much more efficient than an electric vehicle, Callister said. India shows interest . The compressed air car will get a chance to prove itself next year when it competes for the Automotive X Prize. The multimillion-dollar award will go to the team that ""can win a stage race for clean, production-capable vehicles that exceed 100 mpg equivalent fuel economy,"" according to the X Prize Foundation. The air-car concept has also drawn the interest of Tata Motors, India's largest automaker. The company announced an agreement with MDI last year to further develop and refine the technology.

""Do you think somebody would actually put millions of dollars into making a car that will not pass safety regulations? There's no point in doing that,"" Vencat said. Callister pointed out that there haven't been any lightweight, 100-plus mpg cars to pass crash tests but said it could be done through a ""very clever design"" of a lightweight frame. A good prototype could dispel many of the doubts about the compressed air car, he added.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Palestinian Authority is planning to hold overdue elections this year, a move seen as a reaction to the political discontent taking hold across the Arab world. Officials said the authority will hold legislative and presidential elections no later than September in the West Bank and Gaza. The announcement comes a few days after officials said they intend to hold local elections in the West Bank and Gaza. Yasser Abed Rabbo, the secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said polls will be held ""to satisfy the will of the Palestinian people."" Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi said the Palestinians believe ""it's high time"" for polls ""because we need to re-establish the legitimacy of our institutions through elections."" ""We are a big nation, we have lots of people with potential and ability and integrity and charisma and national commitment and I think we should come up with leadership that will do the job,"" she told CNN. Palestinians regard these moves as a response to ferment in the Arab world -- street outrage that sparked the overthrow of strongmen in Egypt and Tunisia, a government change in Jordan, and a promise in Algeria to end the emergency rule there. Also, leaders across the Arab world are envisioning reforms to address grassroots economic grievances. The election announcement was also made amid a persistent focus on resolving Palestinian disputes with Israel. In another development on Saturday that clouds the direction of Israeli-Palestinian talks, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, the face of the Palestinian people to many in the West, resigned from his post. The election announcement comes amid a deep political schism. The West Bank government of the Palestinian Authority is dominated by the Fatah party of President Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza is ruled by the rival Islamist group Hamas. It's unclear now whether the polls will be held in Gaza since the Hamas movement rejects the authority of the Palestinian Authority government in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum called the plan for elections ""invalid and illegal,"" claiming that Palestinian Authority leaders President Mahmoud Abbas and Salam Fayyad lack the legitimacy to make such a move. He said that political reconciliation between Palestinians was necessary before elections could be held and characterized the announcement as a move by the Palestinian Authority to prevent the wave of revolutionary changes taking place in the region from spreading to the Palestinians. But Ashrawi said the Palestinian Authority is trying to persuade Hamas to participate in elections and believes elections would help the state address its concerns with Israel. ""We are preparing also for statehood and we believe this is an instrument for national unity -- so all these things made it imperative that we do have elections between now and September,"" she said. The vote would mark the first time elections have been held in the Palestinian territories since 2006. In that year, legislative elections brought Hamas into power and led to international sanctions against the Palestinian Authority until Hamas agrees to the renunciation of violence, acceptance of previous agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and the recognition of Israel. Various attempts at reaching an accord through Palestinian unity talks have ended in deadlock. Israel wields ultimate authority in the West Bank despite significant local autonomy there. Israel withdrew its troops and citizens from Gaza in 2005, but attacks by Gaza-based militants on the Jewish state have prompted tough Israeli military responses and a stiff economic embargo. ""We are undergoing a serious political crisis given the fact that Israel is continuing settlement activities -- there are no negotiations and there is no international will to hold Israel accountable,"" said Ashrawi, who's also a member of the Fatah executive committee.","Presidential, national elections to be held by September, authorities say .
A legislator says it would restore Palestinian ""legitimacy""
This comes amid potent discontent in the Arab world ."
"(CNN) -- Billy Powell, keyboardist with the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, died of a heart ailment at his condo in the Jacksonville, Florida, suburb of Orange Park, police said Thursday. He was 56. Billy Powell, center, poses with other members of Lynyrd Skynyrd at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2006. Powell, who died early Wednesday, had survived the band's October 1977 plane crash in Mississippi that killed lead singer Ronnie Van Zant; guitarist Steve Gaines; Gaines's sister, vocalist Cassie Gaines; an assistant road manager; and the pilot and copilot. Powell was seriously injured in the crash. More than 40 fans left messages on a fan Web site. ""Billy, you are truely free now. Rock on with Ronnie and the gang. You also will be forever missed,"" read a note signed by traceyspruill. ""I cannot believe the hurt that I have felt from being a Skynyrd fan, but I realize that it only hurts so much because I love the members of this band like my own family. We will always miss you, Billy. I can hear your fingertips rolling off those ivory keys right now. Thanks for being you. Rest in peace and may God bless you,"" another fan wrote. According to Orange Park Police Lt. Mark Cornett, Powell called 911 around midnight Tuesday from his condo at the Club Continental, complaining about chest pains. ""When paramedics and police arrived, they found him unresponsive on the bed,"" Cornett said. Powell was pronounced dead at the scene, and his cardiologist signed the death certificate at 1:52 a.m. ET Wednesday. According to the officer, Powell missed an appointment with the same doctor on Tuesday. Powell joined the original Skynyrd band in 1972, but he worked for the Jacksonville, Florida-based band for several years before that as a crew member. Among the Southern rock band's acclaimed songs are ""What's Your Name,"" ""Freebird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" all released in the 1970s. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" reached the top 10 in 1974. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Two years after the plane crash, Powell, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington and Leon Wilkeson formed the Rossington-Collins Band. It broke up in 1982. A new Lynyrd Skynyrd band formed in 1987 and included Johnny Van Zant, Ronnie's brother. It began a tour in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the plane was headed when it crashed. The band's last album, ""Vicious Cycle,"" came out in 2003.","Billy Powell called 911 Tuesday night complaining of chest pains, police say .

"(CNN) -- The explosions that killed one person and wounded two others in central Stockholm, Sweden, were ""an act of terrorism,"" a Swedish police official said Sunday. Two explosions occurred within minutes of each other Saturday in the district full of Christmas shoppers, Swedish authorities said. A Swedish news agency and police said they received e-mailed threats 10 minutes before the explosions, but Swedish authorities have not confirmed the three events are connected, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said Sunday. The Swedish Security Service said the incidents appeared to be the work of ""a single perpetrator."" Reinfeldt called the explosions ""completely unacceptable"" as he mounted an impassioned defense of Swedish society in the face of what seems to be its first suicide bombing. ""This is not the path we want to go down. It is very serious that this has already happened,"" he said. ""Sweden is an open society,"" Reinfeldt added. ""It is an open society which has demonstrated a will that people must be able to come from different backgrounds, believe in different gods or not believe in any god at all. Be able to live side by side, together, in our open society."" Posts on websites that frequently feature statements and propaganda videos from Islamic radical groups posted a name and photo of a man identified as the attacker on Sunday. But Swedish police did not confirm the name Sunday evening, saying they were still trying to notify relatives of the dead man. Regional police chief Carin Gotblad said the bomber had ""failed."" ""While this was a very serious event, no innocent people were seriously hurt. If that was the intention, then the perpetrator failed,"" she said, adding that the country would not increase its terror threat level. Anders Thornberg, head of the security measures division for Swedish security police, told reporters Sunday that based on the agency's criteria for terrorism and a chief prosecutor's assessment, ""it is our judgment that this was an act of terrorism."" He said authorities are investigating whether the two explosions were related to one another, ""but there may well be a connection."" On Sunday night, London's Metropolitan Police executed a search warrant in Bedfordshire, north of London, in connection with the Stockholm probe, a police spokesman said. The spokesman, who would not give his name, said the warrant was executed under Britain's Terrorism Act 2000 and that ""no arrests have been made ... and no hazardous substances have been found."" The writer of the e-mailed threats to the Swedish news agency and police mentions the presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan and a Swedish cartoonist who depicted the prophet Mohammed, according to TT, a Swedish news wire that received the threats. The e-mails contained sound files featuring a person speaking in Swedish and Arabic, TT reported. About 500 Swedish troops are in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. The sender referred to Swedish silence regarding the Afghanistan troops and the controversial cartoon by Lars Vilks that depicted Mohammed as having the body of a dog. ""Now your children, daughters and sisters will die like our brothers and sisters and children are dying,"" the e-mail states, according to TT. ""Our actions will speak for themselves,"" the person said in an audio recording attached to the e-mail. ""As long as you don't end your war against Islam and the humiliation against the prophet and with your stupid support to Lars Vilks the pig."" Police said the explosions were in a popular pedestrian shopping area. ""One explosion happened at the intersection of Drottninggatan and Olof Palmes Gata,"" two busy streets in central Stockholm, said police spokeswoman Petra Sjolander. She said the car exploded multiple times. ""It is likely that this was some kind of gas tubes that have caused the car to explode multiple times,"" Sjolander said. Two people at the site of the car explosion were hospitalized with minor injuries, Sjolander said. Video on Sweden's TV4 showed flames spewing from the car, which was parked behind several other vehicles. A second explosion occurred about five minutes later, at the intersection of Drottninggatan and Bryggargatan streets, Sjolander said. ""We don't know at this point what caused the second explosion,"" Sjolander said, describing it as suspicious. An unidentified man was found dead at the scene of the second blast. A bag was found near the body, Sjolander said. ""We had bomb technicians on site, but I can't give you any details of what they did,"" she said. A bomb robot rolled up to the body and removed the bag for examination, according to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. Thornberg said Sunday that he could not confirm whether the man blew himself up. When asked about the possibility of suicide bombing in Stockholm becoming a new trend, Thornberg replied, ""Yes, absolutely -- if that is the case, then it is very serious."" Thornberg said authorities are working on both intelligence and a normal police investigation and will try to determine ""if there may be any more acts of terrorism like this one being planned. At this point, we don't think there are more acts coming, but we can't say for sure."" ""What has happened does not signify a change of the current terrorism threat level in Sweden, but we will continuously be reassessing this to see if what has happened warrants a change in threat level,"" he said. In a message posted on Twitter Saturday, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said, ""Most worrying attempt at terrorist attack in crowded part of central Stockholm. Failed -- but could have been truly catastrophic."" Swedish terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp told CNN that he did not believe the attacker acted alone. ""This was not something where he just woke up and thought that he would blow himself up,"" said Ranstorp, a professor at the Swedish military academy and a former professor in terrorism studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. The e-mail writer ended the message with a call for action ""to all Mujahadeen in Europe and Sweden,"" TT said. ""Now is the time to strike, don't wait any longer,"" the message read, according to TT. ""Step up with whatever you have, even if it is a knife, and I know you have more than a knife. Fear no one, fear not prison, fear not death."" TT said that it was not clear from the e-mail or the audio files if the person belongs to any specific organization. The person claimed to have been to the Middle East and asked family for forgiveness for lying to them. ""I didn't go to the middle east to work,"" the writer said. ""I went there for jihad.""

"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Relatives and a lawyer for a Paraguayan soccer player who was shot in the head in Mexico nearly a year ago reject a suspect's claim that he was not the triggerman. Jose Jorge ""J.J."" Balderas Garza was arrested Tuesday in Mexico City in connection with the January 2010 shooting of soccer star Salvador Cabanas at a bar in the Mexican capital. Cabanas suffered a gunshot wound to the head, but survived. Balderas was a suspect from the start of the investigation, but he eluded authorities for nearly a year. Once in custody, he denied that he was the one who pulled the trigger. ""Of course he is going to say barbarities and things that are not true,"" Cabanas' wife, Maria Lorgia Alonzo, told a Paraguayan radio station. ""For us, the worst has already passed. The important thing is that Salvador is alive and recuperating."" Balderas pinned the shooting on his bodyguard, Francisco Barreto Garcia, who was arrested in June as an accomplice. But Cabanas' lawyer, Oscar German Latorre, told CNN that evidence points to Balderas. ""Because of the caliber of the gun, and the testimony of (Barreto), I think J.J.'s defense will have an arduous task to prove the innocence of their client,"" he said. The Mexican authorities themselves have released the content of interrogations with Barreto and a bar employee that implicate Balderas in the shooting of the soccer player. According to the Barreto's testimony, he worked as a bodyguard for Balderas and they were both at a bar in Mexico City. Balderas went to the bathroom, and a few minutes later, Barreto followed, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Barreto found Balderas and Cabanas confronting each other in the bathroom, and says he saw Balderas shoot him, he told investigators, according to Notimex. A bar employee who worked in the bathroom also witnessed the shooting and corroborated Barreto's story, the agency said. Meanwhile, Paraguayans were pleased that an arrest was made in the case. ""Finally we're content. It was an atrocity that was committed against Salvador Cabanas and, well, we are confident in the Mexican justice system,"" said Carlos Ortellado. ""The truth is, I hope that whoever shot at Cabanas spends a lot of time in jail because he robbed us of an idol,"" said another citizen, Jazmin Garcia.

"(CNN) -- The number of dead in clashes in Southern Sudan has more than doubled, an official said. At least 211 people have been killed in recent attacks by breakaway militias loyal to George Athor, Southern Sudan's Humanitarian Minister James Kok said in a statement late Tuesday. Earlier reports put the figure killed in Jonglei state at 105. Kok said the attacks had continued until Tuesday evening and the death toll was expected to rise further as the bodies of women, children and other civilians who had fled into the bush were still being found. The minister accused unspecified ""northern actors"" of supporting Athor and seeking to destabilize South Sudan. Athor took up arms in 2010 when he was not elected governor of the Southern Sudanese state of Jonglei state . His forces have been attacking villages and clashing with the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the military wing of the movement that governs Southern Sudan. People in the region voted overwhelmingly for independence from the north in a recent referendum, setting the stage for it to become a new country. Athor's forces have attacked the towns of Fanjak and Bor, SPLA spokesman Peter Aguer said last week. Twenty SPLA soldiers, 39 civilians and 30 of the attackers were killed in the attack on Fanjak, he said. Four SPLA soldiers and 12 attackers died in the Bor attack, he added. The clashes took place February 9 and 10, he said. Athor has accused the Southern Sudan government of election fraud, but signed a truce in January, days before the referendum. As the nation readies for official independence on July 9, violence caused by renegade militias has been a concern. Earlier this month, a mutiny among the Joint Integrated Units (JIUs) led by soldiers loyal to militia leader Gabriel Tang resulted in up to 50 deaths. Sixty-five civilians were also injured. The JIUs are a coordinated military force consisting of the northern Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the southern SPLA. Tang's forces had been merged into the units along with SAF. Doctors Without Borders said in a statement last week that it was ""currently responding to a large influx of wounded patients as a result of clashes that began ... in Upper Nile State, Southern Sudan."" ""We are mainly seeing patients with gunshot wounds, and many have significant abdominal and limb injuries,"" said Tim Baerwaldt, head of mission for MSF in Southern Sudan. CNN's Nima Elbagir and Journalist Isma'il Kushkush contributed to this report.","At least 211 people have been killed in attacks by breakaway militias, a minister says .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Headlines heralding violent news of Mexico's drug war splash across the front pages of the country's newspapers. Government tallies list more than 34,600 deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. But many stories behind the statistics are never told, Mexican journalist Marcela Turati Munoz told CNN en Español. ""More of a voice has been given to the violent people; more of a voice has been given to the drug traffickers, and the victims really have not spoken,"" Turati said. Through stories in her new book, ""Fuego Cruzado"" -- Spanish for ""Crossfire"" -- Turati said she hopes long-overlooked victims finally will be heard. Turati conducted interviews in 10 Mexican states while researching the book, which hits shelves Tuesday. In one chapter, she describes a woman, Nicole Polito Malaga, who keeps an altar to honor her three fallen children inside her wood hut. They were among 24 construction workers whose bodies were found in a forest in the Mexican state of Veracruz in 2008. ""We do not want their memory to be stained. They were not involved with drugs. They were poor, humble people,"" she says. A wife describes her family's collapse after her husband disappeared. A pathologist explains what goes through his mind when he examines a decapitated head. Other stories are told in Turati's voice, like that of 10 children killed by an explosion in Durango state while on their way to receive ""Opportunities"" scholarships from the government. Unable to afford coffins, their families shrouded them in blankets, she writes. In another chapter, ""No place for the children,"" Turati takes readers to an interrogation room inside a Laredo, Texas, police station, where a Mexican teenager tells authorities about the first time he killed -- when he was 13 years old. ""I thought I was Superman,"" Rosalio Reta says. ""I loved doing it, killing that first person. Then they tried to take my gun, but it was like taking candy from a kid."" Turati said she hopes the stories in the book will not only ""make victims visible"" but encourage others to act. ""We still have time to see what is happening, reflect on what happened before and think about what type of society we are forming, with so much suffering, so much pain and so many losses,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- In a victory for whale conservationist group Sea Shepherd, Japan's government said Thursday it is considering canceling the whaling season. If Japan does so, this would be the first time the country has canceled its whale hunt in the waters of the Antarctic since 2005, when it began a bitter battle with the animal rights group. ""In response to interference conducted by Sea Shepherd, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has temporarily halted the whaling hunt in the Antarctic Ocean, considering the crew's safety as a first priority,"" Hiroshi Kawamura, an official in charge of research whaling, said on Thursday. ""The ministry is considering what to do hereafter, but the total suspension of this season, which is scheduled to run until mid March, is included in the options."" Sea Shepherd's Capt. Paul Watson said that  the Japanese whalers have not left yet. ""As long as they're here, we'll be here,"" he said from his ship in the Antarctic. Japan has left its fleet of four whaling vessels in the Antarctic, as it decides what to do about the winter hunt, according to the ministry. The ministry announced Wednesday that it was temporarily halting its controversial whale hunting season, blaming the Sea Shepherd activists for impeding the hunt. Japan annually hunts whales, despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling, under the auspices it is conducting scientific research. The moratorium allows the culling of whales for purposes of scientific research. Critics call Japan's hunt a cover for commercial whaling, since the whale meat ends up in supermarkets and restaurants. Animal rights groups, from Greenpeace to Sea Shepherd, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand, have publicly condemned Japan's hunts. Despite the condemnations, Japan continued to hunt whales. Sea Shepherd activists in 2005 started a renegade battle in the high seas against Japan's whalers. They've had a number of high profile clashes, most notably last year, when one of Japan's whaling vessels collided with the Sea Shepherd's Ady Gil speedboat. The captain of the Ady Gil, Paul Bethune, then snuck aboard the Japanese whaling vessel. Bethune, a New Zealand citizen, was arrested and tried in Japan. Bethune was convicted of assault, vandalism and three other charges but released on a suspended prison term. Sea Shepherd's Paul Watson says seven years of chasing the Japanese whalers is beginning to pay off. ""Right from the beginning, our objective was to sink the Japanese whaling fleet economically, to bankrupt them. They're so far in debt right now, they're financially so strapped, even the Japanese government is saying, how much will we pump into this? It's a dying industry. It has no place in the 21st century. I think it's only a matter of time before they shut it down.""","Japan's whale hunting activities have been condemned by animal rights groups .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Though he faces charges of financial wrongdoing and possibly human rights abuses, former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier has no plans to leave his homeland, one of his lawyers said Wednesday. Attorney Reynold Georges told CNN that Duvalier would fight any charges against him and could very well get back into politics. ""You can bet your life on it,"" Georges said, referring to Duvalier's intention to remain in Haiti, adding that Duvalier is looking into renovating one of his old homes. Duvalier made a brief appearance Wednesday, stepping out onto a balcony of the Karibe Hotel and waving to dozens of supporters. ""I will see you later,"" he said. Henri Sterlin, a Duvalier associate, said Duvalier planned to make a longer address later Wednesday or Thursday. Heavily armed police escorted Duvalier on Tuesday from the suburban hotel to a downtown court, where he was questioned for hours. The strongman is facing charges related to the embezzlement of Haitian money for personal gain during his 15-year rule, a government source told CNN. A judge has 30 days to investigate and decide whether the accusations merit moving forward with a case against Duvalier. But Georges said no firm evidence was presented in court. ""Blah, blah, blah,"" Georges said of the accusations. ""We have nothing to hide and we are not afraid of nobody, nothing,"" he said, adding that the judge asked Duvalier when he was planning to leave. ""If he wants to live in this country, that's his right,"" Georges said. ""He is back to stay. He can do politics. He can come and go, do whatever he pleases as long as it is legal."" The Duvalier family ruled Haiti for three decades starting in 1957, when Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier was elected president. He later declared himself president for life. When he died in 1971, he was succeeded by his 19-year-old son, who went by the nickname of Baby Doc. Ousted from power after a popular rebellion in 1986, Baby Doc shocked the world by returning to Haiti on Sunday night after some 25 years of exile in France. Human rights groups have demanded justice for a rule of brutality. During his years in power, thousands were tortured and killed and hundreds of thousands of Haitians fled into exile, according to Human Rights Watch. The United Nations said Tuesday that Duvalier's presence in Haiti had taken the global body by surprise and it ""clearly raises issues of impunity and accountability."" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said a range of human rights abuses and corruption issues surround Duvalier. It's still unclear why Duvalier decided to go back to Haiti but his presence certainly added to a bubbling cauldron of political turmoil sparked by a presidential election mired in controversy. ""Obviously this is an important and crucial time for the people of Haiti,"" said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. ""Any political leader or any former political leader should focus not only on him or herself, but on making progress towards a set of important elections,"" Gibbs said, adding that such people should dedicate ""their time and their energy toward the reconstruction of the country."" Preliminary results of the November 28 election placed former first lady Mirlande Manigat in a runoff with Jude Celestin, the candidate backed by Haiti's unpopular President Rene Preval. However, international monitors charged fraud and a subsequent election review put Celestin in third place. Observers suggested he be eliminated from contention. Preval's government has not officially commented on Duvalier's return, though some Haitians, craving a father figure to lead the nation out of crisis, have commented favorably on the days of Duvalierism. But Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor of the New York-based Haitian Times, blamed the father-son Duvalier dynasty for a nation struggling to regain footing. He said the scars still run deep from an era when no one trusted each other. Pierre-Pierre said he hopes justice will finally prevail. ""If there is a bright spot,"" he said, ""finally we have to face that decision that we have never faced straight up. We've been in denial about what happened during the 29-year reign of dictatorship of the Duvaliers.""

"Milan, Italy (CNN) -- A judge in Italy is set to announce whether Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will face an immediate trial on charges of abuse of power and sex with an underage prostitute. Prosecutors in Milan filed the request for trial last week, setting in motion a five-day clock for Judge Cristina di Censo to make a decision. She can order the trial to go ahead without the traditional preliminary hearing, as Milan chief prosecutor Edmundo Bruti Liberati requested, or dismiss it, allowing investigations to continue to determine if there is enough evidence for trial. She can also refer the case to another jurisdiction, or request one more day to make her decision. Berlusconi's lawyers have argued that the Milan courts do not have jurisdiction -- because of where the alleged crimes were committed -- or the authority to try a prime minister. Prosecutors are investigating claims that Berlusconi paid for sex with nightclub dancer Karima El Mahrough, who was 17 at the time of the alleged activity, and later intervened with the police after she was arrested on an unrelated charge. Berlusconi dismissed the accusations as ""groundless"" when the prosecution request was filed Wednesday, saying the call for a trial was a ""farce."" There was no abuse of power, he said. And he said he was ""sorry because these (allegations) have offended the dignity of the country. They've thrown mud on the government, on the country and on myself at an international level."" Thousands of Italians took to the streets across the country Sunday to protest Berlusconi's alleged behavior toward women. The largest gathering was in Rome, where organizers said 100,000 people gathered, under the slogan, ""If not now, when?"" In Milan, organizers estimated that 60,000 people gathered. Protests also took place outside Italy, including marches in Tokyo and Geneva, Switzerland. Sunday's demonstrations were the biggest anti-Berlusconi rallies since the most recent sex scandal broke. Berlusconi has denied that he has ever paid anyone for sex. The protests were organized by women's groups and publicized by internet. The turnout surprised the organizers, who didn't want the demonstrations to be political, though that's what they became. One woman who came with her family to the Milan rally told CNN that she was ""fed up with the way women are portrayed as objects in the Italian media. The way that young girls are glorified by their looks and youth and then what? I don't want my daughter to grow up thinking that that is the only way to be ... that the only thing that matters is to be pretty and show off their legs. ... We are more than that."" In Milan, demonstrators had banners that said, ""Stop the merchandising of women,"" and ""Berlusconi enough. You bring us shame."" Many of the speakers at the Milan rally criticized the way Berlusconi's sex scandal made Italy look, his behavior towards women and his promoting ex-show girls to high government positions. Protesters said leaked evidence from the investigation show he has little respect for female dignity, the state-run ANSA news agency reported. Wiretaps published in the media suggest he surrounded himself at parties at his home with starlets and other women hoping to use their looks to gain positions in politics or at Berlusconi's Mediaset TV empire, ANSA reported. The investigation began in December, after Berlusconi called police in May, urging them to release El Mahrough, nicknamed Ruby, from jail, where she was being held on theft charges. Prosecutors say the activity took place from February until May 2010. Both El Mahrough, now 18, and Berlusconi have denied they ever had sex. El Mahrough said she did not know Berlusconi well but that she did receive 7,000 euros (about $9,300) from him the first time they met, on Valentine's Day 2010, because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help. The young woman's former roommate told investigators that El Mahrough confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier. Berlusconi's party argued that he believed that Ruby was Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's niece and the phone call to the police station on her behalf was done to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with Egypt. The lower house of Italy's Parliament voted against allowing Milan prosecutors to search property belonging to Berlusconi as part of the investigation.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A powerful bomb planted in a car killed nine people and injured 21 others in northwest Pakistan on Wednesday, a senior police official said. The bomb rocked a neighborhood in the outskirts of Peshawar and destroyed several shops, said Peshawar police chief Liaqat Ali Khan.

"(CNN) -- Sudan has ordered a French medical aid agency out of South Darfur state, accusing the organization of supporting rebel forces and for releasing what it called false rape reports against forces loyal to the Khartoum government, according to state-run media. Sudan News Agency (SUNA) announced the expulsion of Medecins du Monde on Tuesday. Appearing at a news conference in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, Gov. Abdel Hamid Moussa Kasha accused the organization of sharing intelligence with the rebels of the Sudan Liberation Movement, giving them access to satellite telephones and medicine. Kasha also accused the organization of publishing false rape reports and for delivering tons of expired medications to eastern Jebel Marra via the joint African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur. Médecins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, describes itself on its website as ""an international humanitarian organisation providing medical care to vulnerable populations affected by war, natural disasters, disease, famine, poverty or exclusion,"" and has a network extending to 16 countries in four continents.","Sudan expels French medical aid agency .

"Milan, Italy (CNN) -- Thousands of Italians took to the streets in some 200 cities across the country Sunday in protest of Prime Minister's Silvio Berlusconi's alleged behavior toward women. The largest gathering was in Rome, where organizers said 100,000 people gathered, under the slogan, ""If not now, when?"" In Milan, organizers estimated that 60,000 people gathered. Protests also took place outside Italy, including marches in Tokyo and Geneva. Sunday's demonstrations were the biggest anti-Berlusconi rallies since the most recent sex scandal broke in January, when Milan prosecutors said they were investigating whether the prime minister abused his power by helping an underaged woman, who he had allegedly paid for sex, get out of jail on a theft charge. Berlusconi has denied that he has ever paid anyone for sex. A string of sex scandals have dogged him. The protests were organized by women's groups and publicized by internet. The turnout surprised the organizers, who didn't want the demonstrations to be political, though that's what they became. One woman who came with her family to the Milan rally told CNN that she was ""fed up with the way women are portrayed as objects in the Italian media. The way that young girls are glorified by their looks and youth and then what? I don't want my daughter to grow up thinking that that is the only way to be ... that the only thing that matters is to be pretty and show off their legs. ... We are more than that."" In Milan, demonstrators had banners that said, ""Stop the merchandising of women,"" and ""Berlusconi enough. You bring us shame."" Many of the speakers at the Milan rally criticized the way Berlusconi's sex scandal made Italy look, his behavior towards women and his promoting ex-show girls to high government positions. Protesters said leaked evidence from the investigation show he has little respect for female dignity, the state-run ANSA news agency reported. Wiretaps published in the media suggest he surrounded himself at parties at his home with starlets and other women hoping to use their looks to gain positions in politics or at Berlusconi's Mediaset TV empire, ANSA reported. The investigation began in December, after Berlusconi called police in May, urging them to release Karima El Mahrough, nicknamed Ruby, from jail, where she was being held on theft charges. Prosecutors say the activity took place from February until May 2010. Both El Mahrough, now 18, and Berlusconi have denied they ever had sex. El Mahrough said she did not know Berlusconi well but that she did receive 7,000 euros (about $9,300) from him the first time they met, on Valentine's Day 2010, because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help. The young woman's former roommate told investigators that El Mahrough confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier. Berlusconi's party argued that he believed that Ruby was Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's niece and the phone call to the police station on her behalf was done to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with Egypt. The lower house of Italy's Parliament voted against allowing Milan prosecutors to search property belonging to Berlusconi as part of the investigation.

"(CNN) -- Amid public outrage over government corruption, unemployment and a lack of basic services, Iraq's parliament approved the appointments of eight new ministers to the Cabinet on Sunday -- but key security posts remain empty. The lawmakers greenlighted candidates tapped by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki for ministries that include electricity, trade and municipalities. The first female minister was approved for the Cabinet to oversee women's affairs. Candidates for the ministries of defense, interior and national security have not been named, though parliamentary speaker Osama al-Nujaifi told his colleagues that al-Maliki promised to submit nominees for those posts in the coming days. Meanwhile, hundreds of angry demonstrators took to the streets of Ramadi -- about 100 kilometers west of Baghdad -- on Sunday, protesting against the government's inability to provide basic services. Similar demonstrations have been held across Iraq in recent weeks, inspired by uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and other countries in the region. In December, after nearly a year fraught with political infighting, the parliament voted to approve al-Maliki's new government, despite the vacancies. The long-awaited legislative action came more than nine months after a hotly disputed national election that threatened to inflame the country's deep sectarian tensions. The government composition is inclusive of Iraq's major ethnic and sectarian groups, brought together by a fragile U.S.-backed power sharing deal agreed on in November. But it is clear that sectarianism remains, as the posts were divided along ethnic and sectarian lines. The prime minister has three deputies -- a Shiite, a Kurd, and a Sunni Arab, representing the three largest entities in Iraq. Saleh al-Mutlaq, who has been one of al-Maliki's critics, is the Sunni deputy. He had been barred from politics because of alleged ties to the Baathist party, the outlawed political movement of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Parliament lifted that ban in December. On Sunday, the parliament failed to hold a vote on three vice presidents under the power-sharing deal after some lawmakers had reservations on a Shiite candidate. At the end of 2011, the United States is set to withdraw all of its troops from Iraq as part of a bilateral agreement with the Baghdad government. It is too soon to predict whether that will happen or whether the United States and Iraq will negotiate an agreement to keep some U.S. soldiers there after next year.","Security posts in Cabinet remain unfilled .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A Lebanese bank has denied accusations by the U.S. Treasury Department that it is involved in laundering hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of a drug kingpin -- and rejected claims it has links with Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based militia. On Thursday the Treasury described the Lebanese Canadian Bank in Beirut as a ""financial institution of primary money laundering concern."" The Treasury said it had reason to believe that managers at the bank were complicit in money laundering by Ayman Joumaa, an alleged trafficker accused by U.S. authorities of shipping drugs from South America to Europe and the Middle East through west Africa. The Treasury also said its action in designating the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) exposed links between the bank and Hezbollah -- which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States. Designation means that U.S. persons are prohibited from conducting financial or commercial transactions with individuals listed, whose assets under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen. U.S. Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey said: ""Any financial institution that collaborates in illicit conduct on this scale risks losing its access to the United States."" The bank's chairman, Georges Zard Abou Jaoude, told CNN Friday that the bank had no relationship whatsoever with Hezbollah nor to the best of its knowledge with anyone designated by the U.S. Treasury Department. Jaoude said the bank had identified an account in Joumaa's name but it had not been used in four years. It had notified Lebanese regulators about the account, and the bank's books had been regularly inspected by the Special Investigation Commission, a Lebanese task force set up to counter money laundering. The Treasury said Joumaa's network ""launders hundreds of millions of dollars monthly through accounts held at LCB, as well as through trade-based money laundering involving consumer goods throughout the world."" In its statement issued Thursday, the Treasury estimated that as much as $200 million was being laundered on a monthly basis. ""At least one of the individuals involved in this global drug trafficking and money laundering network has worked directly with LCB managers to conduct his transactions,"" the Treasury said. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which was also involved in the investigation, said: ""The Lebanese Canadian Bank for years has participated in a sophisticated money laundering scheme involving used cars purchased in the United States and consumer goods overseas."" The Treasury said the bank's links to Hezbollah included a subsidiary in Gambia called Prime Bank, formed in 2009, which it said was ""partially owned by a Lebanese individual known to be a supporter of Hezbollah. "" Jaoude told CNN the bank rigorously adhered to all blacklists published by financial authorities around the world. He said the bank had not been contacted in advance by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control before Thursday's announcement and he was urgently trying to contact U.S. authorities. ""All our books are open to the American Treasury,"" Jaoude said. ""We have to clear our name,"" he said. In its most recent annual report, the bank said ""it is fighting money laundering by complying with international and [Lebanese] Central Bank circulars."" The Lebanese Canadian bank has 35 branches in Lebanon, as well as its subsidiary in Gambia and an office in Canada. The bank has grown quickly in recent years, from assets of $2.83 billion in 2005 to $5.18 billion in 2009. Ayman Joumaa was designated in January -- along with nine individuals and 19 entities connected to his drug trafficking and money laundering. A Treasury statement said he ""coordinated the transportation, distribution, and sale of multi-ton shipments of cocaine from South America and has laundered the proceeds from the sale of cocaine in Europe and the Middle East, according to investigations led by the Drug Enforcement Administration."" Joumaa's whereabouts are unknown. He is believed to hold Lebanese and Colombian passports. One of the entities designated along with Joumaa was a company that runs a used car business in Benin and Congo out of southern Lebanon. Its manager, Iman Kharoubi, told Lebanon's Daily Star last month: ""We work in Lebanon and Congo and Benin in Africa. But we do not know who Ayman Joumaa is; we don't have anything to do with him."" CNN's attempts to reach Kharoubi were unsuccessful. For several years, U.S. authorities have alleged that Hezbollah is profiting from drug trafficking from South America to Europe via west Africa. In June 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department designated two Venezuelans of Lebanese descent as Hezbollah financiers and supporters.","Treasury says bank launders money for drug dealer, has ties to Hezbollah .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Part-nationalized British banking group RBS announced massive losses for 2008, totaling £24.1 billion ($34.7 billion) on Thursday. The results are the worst in British corporate history. RBS's loss exceeded the previous record set by Vodafone in 2006 by more than £10 million ($14.2 million). ""Last year was undeniably tough and a worsening economic environment means that 2009 will present significant challenges in all of our markets,"" said Philip Hampton, RBS chairman. ""The path to recovery will be neither smooth nor straight."" The results were not quite as bad as had been expected, said CNN business anchor Charles Hodson, and they caused RBS shares to rise 25.5 percent by close of play Thursday. ""This is a watershed,"" Hodson said. ""RBS hopes this is a positive turning point ... that now this is where the recovery begins, with the old regime being laid to rest.""  Watch as CNN's Charles Hodson analyses RBS results » . Hodson added: ""RBS will hope this is as bad as it gets. But there's a body of thought that says it's badly positioned."" The 2008 financial report from RBS includes a three- to five-year restructuring plan that will focus the group's business in the United Kingdom, with more limited global operations. The plan includes changes in management, isolation of toxic assets, and selling or closing ""non-core"" businesses. Last October, RBS was one of three major banks the British Treasury pumped $63 billion into to keep liquid. The other two financial institutions were HBOS and Lloyds TSB. The bailout saw the government take a 70 percent stake in RBS, making the government the bank's largest shareholder and effectively nationalizing the company. ""We have moved purposefully to take major decisions that are necessary to restructure the group,"" said Stephen Hester, RBS group chief executive. ""We are charting a path to standalone strength and with it the goal of justifying the support of the UK government and all our shareholders."" In January, the government announced the Asset Protection Scheme -- an effort to help British banks caught up in the global financial crisis. The Treasury revealed details of the plan Thursday. The plan has a number of facets benefiting the bank and the government. Under the plan, the British government will insure £325 billion in RBS assets. RBS must pay a ""participation fee"" of £6.5 billion to the Treasury and bear 19.5 billion of any loss -- a sort of deductible. In addition, RBS will promise to lend £25 billion this year -- £9 billion for mortgage lending and £16 billion to businesses. That commitment is key for the government, which has been urging banks to increase lending. The government will also inject an extra £13 billion in capital -- a move that will raise the government's stake in RBS to 80 percent. RBS must now start restructuring and cutting costs, and layoffs are likely. ""We're going to see a much slimmer bank, a much smaller balance sheet, several billion dollars' worth of costs taken out, and hopefully that will guarantee them a future,"" Hodson said. The Royal Bank of Scotland is one of Britain's oldest banks. It was founded in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1727 and branched out to England in 1874. After winning a takeover battle for British bank NatWest in 2000, RBS set its sights on Dutch bank ABN-AMRO. Two years ago, RBS bought ABN-AMRO as part of a consortium with Santander and Fortis, paying $15 billion for its share out of a total of $75 billion. ABN-AMRO was the source of big write-downs for RBS, leading to the government bailout in October. Former RBS Chairman Tom McKillop recently admitted publicly that buying ABN-AMRO was a mistake. Earlier this month, former RBS Chief Executive Fred Goodwin told members of the British Parliament he was sorry for the bank's part in the global financial crisis.  Watch consternation at Goodwin's £16 million pension » . ""There is a profound, unqualified apology for all of the stress that has been caused,"" Goodwin said. But he said the troubles at the bank were not all due to him. ""It's just too simple if you want to blame it all on me,"" Goodwin said. ""If you want to blame it all on me and close the book now, that'll get the job done very quickly, but it does not go anywhere close to the cause of all of this."" Goodwin, 50, faced scrutiny Thursday over his annual pension of 650,000 pounds ($933,000) following RBS's announcement. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling urged Goodwin to give up his pension, telling the BBC that ""these excesses"" cannot be justified.","British banking group RBS posts huge losses for 2008, totaling $34.7 billion .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Jordan's King Abdullah II swore in a new government Wednesday with a mandate for political reform, a former general at its head and several opposition and media figures among its ranks. Abdullah shook up his Cabinet last week amid protests at home. While the king gave new prime minister Marouf al Bakhit orders to implement ""genuine political reform,"" Bakhit's appointment was seen as an attempt to shore up support among Jordan's Bedouin tribes -- the bedrock of the monarchy. Bakhit is a former national security official who served a previous stint as prime minister, ending in 2007. His Cabinet includes members of several Jordanian political parties, opposition groups, the editor of a newspaper that is sometimes critical of the government and one person considered an independent Islamist. Jordan's economy has been hit hard by the global economic downturn and fast-rising commodity prices. As in nearby Egypt, where longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak faces the toughest challenge to his nearly 30-year rule, youth unemployment is high. Officials close to the palace told CNN last week that Abdullah is trying to turn a regional upheaval into an opportunity for reform. Bakhit will serve as defense minister as well as prime minister in the new government, while Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh and Finance Minister Mohammad Abu Hammour kept their portfolios in the shakeup. Hussein Mjalli, a former head of the Jordanian lawyer's association and member of the country's opposition Baath Party, is the new justice minister. A journalist, Tareq Masarweh, joined the Cabinet as culture minister, while Taher Odwan, the editor of the Jordanian daily newspaper Arab Al Yawm, will take the post of communications minister. Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood has refused an offer to join the government, arguing that the prime minister should be chosen by parliament instead of the king. But an independent Islamist, Abdul Raheem Ekour, was named the kingdom's Islamic affairs minister. CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","King Abdullah II swore in a new Cabinet Wednesday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If the craggy, icy west coast of Greenland doesn't inspire them, perhaps Vanessa Carlton's vodka infusions will. Singer KT Tunstall relaxes as the Cape Farewell tour heads towards Disko Bay. On Friday, the American singer-songwriter and self-professed ""expert infuser"" will join an unlikely ensemble of 40 artists, scientists and musicians aboard the 10-day ""Cape Farewell"" expedition to Disko Bay. Musicians Jarvis Cocker, KT Tunstall, Martha Wainwright and Leslie Feist will be there negotiating the bridge with acclaimed French artist Sophie Calle, performance artist Laurie Anderson and novelist Nicole Krauss. See the full crew list . They're not there to perform but to be inspired by the scientists, their work and their surroundings, in the hope they'll return home with a deeper understanding of climate change. ""It's two-way traffic,"" explains Cape Farewell founder, artist David Buckland. ""The place itself is inspiring, the dialogue about climate change is inspiring and the science that we actually do on board is important to the scientists, but it's also inspiring to see scientists working. ""You don't just look at a graph; you actually see who gets the data that feeds into the graph. And from all that, the output is that we find this new language, this new way of communication and that's what the creative souls are there to do."" Around midday Friday, the sturdy and ice-strengthened science research vessel, the ""Grigory Mikheev,"" will depart Kangerlussuaq in Greenland bound for Disko Bay, a location on the west coast that provides some of the starkest examples of the island's melting ice caps. There, the geologists on board will acoustically measure the seabed some two kilometers below. ""What happens is that as ice melts from Greenland it lessens the weight on the land and the land rises. This causes cracks to appear in the ocean seafloor -- this is what we think,"" explains Buckland, adding ""So you can measure what's happening to the landmass of Greenland by looking at the sea."" It's fair to say that the work the artists are hoping to achieve on board requires less scientific rigor. When CNN spoke with British comedian Marcus Brigstocke the day before departure, he was trying to decide which suit to pack. ""I'm wearing a suit jacket and a waistcoat, trying to work out what's the lightest thing I can put in my bag which will also keep me sufficiently warm if I do a stand-up routine on an iceberg."" Brigstocke joined the Cape Farewell crew last year on their most ambitious voyage yet, down the east coast of Greenland. After suffering the combined trauma of seasickness and a cabin awash with sewage after a plumbing failure, Brigstocke vowed he'd ""never, ever"" do it again. ""When I asked him, he sort of went white,"" Buckland laughs. ""I promised him a bigger boat this time, in a cabin that doesn't do somersaults. We're not sailing this time, which is a sadness for me, but it means we can do a lot more work."" On his return last year, Brigstocke wove his experience into a stand-up routine. This time, he's hoping to complete the program they started filming last year on climate change and the Cape Farewell trip. ""I don't know what the end result will be,"" he says. ""It doesn't particularly matter. The footage already is astonishing."" Vanessa Carlton, the U.S. musician best known for her Grammy-nominated single ""A Thousand Miles,"" describes herself as ""pretty green."" ""Right now I'm walking and I'm carrying a reusable grocery bag -- I've just been to the grocery store,"" she tells CNN by cell phone from New York. ""I wear mostly vintage clothes. I have a very energy-efficient house -- very long-lasting light bulbs. Everything's off unless I really need something to be on. If I'm away for a long time, I turn off my water heater."" She's intrigued to see how her experience on the Cape Farewell Expedition will manifest itself in her music. She's also unsure of what she can teach the scientists on board. ""Perhaps I will have a more emotional response to the surrounding than they normally do,"" she guesses, adding ""I hope that inspires their work and injects a bit of 'non-scientific' spirit into the voyage."" Or perhaps another kind of spirit: ""I'm an expert vodka infuser and will be teaching a thing or two about infusions."" It was a much more sober affair when Cape Farewell's Youth Expedition wound its way from Iceland, around the southern tip of Greenland, across the Davis Strait and down the coast of Canada earlier this month.  See photos of the Youth Expedition » . Most of the 28 students on board returned to their respective schools this week. Luisa Lizoain, a 16-year-old grade 11 student from the University of Toronto Schools described the experience as life-changing. ""We went to a few small villages when we were in the north of Greenland and Baffin Island,"" Lizoain told CNN. ""Meeting the people who live in the north put a face to climate change for me."" ""I want to try and raise as much awareness as possible and tell as many people as possible about this experience and what I've just seen."" Martin Rose, director of the British Council Canada, which organized the Youth Expedition with Cape Farewell, says, ""It was clear that the snow was late and the glaciers are retreating year by year."" ""There are all sorts of complicated arguments around that, but symbolically it's quite powerful to see green and red hillsides when normally there'd now be snow,"" he continued. Upon boarding, the Youth Expedition students were given sketchbooks and were encouraged to spend at least ten minutes a day being creative. While sketchbooks won't be standard issue for the professional artists on the Disko Bay Expedition, David Buckland says creative freedom will be encouraged. ""If anybody is inspired to do anything we'll stop the boat and we'll do it, we'll find a way to do it, and that's the rule, that's the only rule: follow the inspiration."" And he doesn't care how long it takes. Author Ian McEwan boarded the boat in 2005 and has only just revealed that his new book, ""A Boot Room in The Frozen North,"" is about climate change. ""Brilliant. I can sit and wait for that, that's fine,"" Buckland says. ""It's a difficult subject, it's a great big amorphous subject, it's abstract and therefore to try to make it real, on a human scale, that's the really important message they get across."" Everyone on board the boat will be blogging about their adventure. You can have your say by posting a comment below.","Forty artists and scientists board science research vessel off Greenland coast .

"(CNN) -- Numerous Arab governments have used violence to quash demonstrations in the wake of mass protests in Egypt, a leading human rights group says in a new report. Human Rights Watch, which says it conducts ""rigorous, objective investigations,"" issued the report Tuesday alleging clampdowns by Palestinian leadership, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. ""Images of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt have mesmerized the Arab public but have terrified their rulers,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, the group's Middle East and North Africa director, said in a statement. ""They have responded with their usual mix of repression and intimidation to nip the buds of any wider democratic blossoming."" Human Rights Watch said the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, ""used violence against peaceful demonstrators"" during a rally last week in which people were supporting the Egyptian protesters.  ""Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that regular police and 'special forces,' identifiable by their uniforms, punched, kicked, and detained participants, as well as at least two journalists and a Human Rights Watch research assistant,"" the report said. The report added that on January 30, the Palestinian Authority shut down a solidarity demonstration. Hamas, which controls Gaza, ""quashed a solidarity demonstration on January 31,"" Human Rights Watch said.  ""The police arbitrarily arrested six women and threatened to arrest another 20 people, who had responded to a call on Facebook for a demonstration, as soon as they arrived at the Park of the Unknown Soldier in Gaza City."" CNN reported on the January 31 demonstration, in which Hamas security broke up the event and detained some female protesters. CNN has also reported on the Palestinian Authority breaking up two attempts to stage small rallies.  The Palestinian Authority said participants did not have government permission for the rallies.  Witnesses said participants were pushed and shoved, and some were detained. Later, both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas allowed some events supporting solidarity with Egypt to take place. On Saturday, Palestinians demonstrating in support of Egyptian anti-government protesters, at an approved event in Ramallah, were forcibly dispersed when a few dozen men in civilian clothes disrupted the protest. A spokesman for the Palestinian Authority security services, Maj. Gen. Adnan Dmeiri, told CNN that that demonstration ""had all the permits needed, and it is our duty as the Palestinian security to protect the demonstration, which the police and the security did. Our duty is to protect and serve the people."" Human Rights Watch said that in Syria, security services briefly detained five young demonstrators at three different protests, and that on February 2, ""a group of 20 people in civilian clothing beat and dispersed 15 demonstrators who had assembled in Bab Touma in old Damascus to hold a candlelight vigil for Egyptian demonstrators. Police nearby failed to intervene, one of the gathering's organizers told Human Rights Watch. ""When demonstrators went to the local police station to file a complaint, a security official insulted and slapped Suheir Atassi, one of the main organizers, and accused her of being a 'germ' and an agent of foreign powers. Syria's security services had summoned more than 10 activists to pressure them not to demonstrate."" Syria had no immediate public response to the report on its state-run news agency, SANA.  A representative of the Syrian Embassy in Washington had no immediate response. In the United Arab Emirates, Human Rights Watch said, state security arrested Hasan Muhammad al-Hammadi, who ""had spoken out publicly in solidarity with the Egyptian demonstrators"" during a mosque sermon.  ""He remains in detention."" UAE officials did not immediately respond to a call from CNN. In Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch said, ""security forces briefly arrested between 30 and 50 demonstrators in Jeddah"" on January 28, according to reports. ""Police arrested demonstrators as soon as they gathered, with dozens of others scattering."" Saudi Arabia had no mention of the report on its state-run news agency, the Saudi Press Agency.  The Saudi Embassy in Washington had no immediate response. In Yemen, Human Rights Watch said, ""police and military forces used live and rubber bullets to disperse protesters on February 3.  Six people were injured and 28 arrested, the Yemeni Observatory for Human Rights reported."" Mohammed Al-Basha, spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, told CNN on Wednesday that the February 3 protests were generally peaceful.  ""There were some incidents"" in which ""demonstrators physically provoked police officers"" or destroyed properties, and those demonstrators were detained, he said, adding that most were later released. ""Live ammunitions are never shot directly at any demonstrators,"" he added, saying that sometimes authorities will shoot into the air to disperse crowds, such as when they get close to a government building. On Monday, Yemeni Prime Minister Ali Mujawar told CNN his country is ""democratic"" with a ""democratic regime,"" and accused opposition parties of ""trying to duplicate what happened in Tunisia and Egypt, and act as if it should be imposed on the people here in Yemen."" In Sudan, Human Rights Watch said, ""authorities used excessive force during largely peaceful protests on January 30 and 31 in Khartoum and other northern cities to call for an end to the National Congress Party (NCP) rule and government-imposed price increases."" ""Witnesses in Khartoum and Omdurman reported that armed riot police and national security personnel dispersed groups of protesters using pipes, sticks, and teargas, injuring several people and preventing some people from joining the protests. Some protesters threw rocks at riot police, but most were peaceful, witnesses said. The majority of those arrested were released within hours, but more than 20 are still missing and believed to be held by national security forces."" The Sudanese Embassy in Washington responded that the country ""affirms and protects the right of the citizens to demonstrate as they wish, provided that people abide by the rules and regulations in place, guidelines meant to ensure public order and safety."" In a statement, the embassy said ""some opportunists capitalize"" on incidents aimed at maintaining safety ""to inspire chaos or smear Sudan's image."" ""A few zealous individuals from both sides of the aisle might act in a way that contravenes the right to free expression,"" the statement added.

"(CNN) -- If you're a James Bond fan, times right now are as dark as one of 007's tuxedos. The next Bond movie has been put on hold because of MGM's lingering financial troubles. And no one knows when, or even if, a Bond movie will hit the big screen again. But this week, the promise that appears at the end credits of every Bond film (""James Bond Will Return ..."") is being kept by a pair of video games. Activision is releasing two new Bond games -- ""GoldenEye 007 "" for the Nintendo Wii and ""James Bond 007: Blood Stone"" for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC -- and the voice and image of current Bond star Daniel Craig appears in both. Activision's Kyle Walker boldly declares: ""This is the Bond event of 2010."" Like James Bond at the beginning of a mission, these new games face potentially hostile territory. With two years gone by since the last Bond movie, ""Quantum of Solace,"" it seems the only place you see the phrase, ""Bond ... James Bond,"" these days is in the financial pages. Will Bond fans raise their martini glasses to toast 007's long-awaited return in these games? Or will Bond's absence from the pop culture radar cause fans to put out their own burn notice on the missing superspy and move on to something else? ""Fans are going to be very happy with it,"" promises Michael O'Donnell, lead producer for ""James Bond 007: Blood Stone."" He believes ""Blood Stone's"" original story (written by Bruce Feirstein, who's co-written screenplays for three Bond films), international locations and intense action sequences will satisfy gamers and Bond film devotees alike. ""The [game's] cinematic presentation will take a lot of people by surprise,"" says O'Donnell, who also cites a new Bond girl -- singer Joss Stone, who performs in the game and sings its theme song. ""We're definitely going to do [James Bond] justice."" The makers of ""GoldenEye 007"" have to pull off more than just doing James Bond justice. That new Wii game is an update of the classic 1997 ""GoldenEye"" game for the Nintendo 64, which itself was based on the 1995 film that introduced Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. The game is still widely considered one of the best shooting games ever. ""GoldenEye's"" makers are well aware that tinkering with a classic can be as dangerous as messing with Odd Job when he's cranky. ""It was a massive thing when we found out we were going to working on this,"" says ""GoldenEye"" lead producer Dawn Pinkney. ""You have to live up to the best shooter of all time."" The new ""GoldenEye"" has gotten a fresh coat of paint for its relaunch. The dialogue has been adapted to suit Daniel Craig's man-of-few-words style; the 1990s setting of the original has been updated to resemble a 2010 world; and unlike the original, the new ""GoldenEye"" will have an online multiplayer option. But even with all the changes, Pinkney insists, ""We didn't stray too far from 'GoldenEye' -- it still is 'GoldenEye.' "" ""It was a bold choice on their part to remake such a favorite,"" says Morgan Webb, host of G4's video game review show ""X-Play,"" about the ""GoldenEye"" update. Webb, who has yet to play the new Bond games, fears some gamers might slam the new ""GoldenEye"" for straying too far from the beloved original while others may slam it for not having changed enough to suit the times. ""It runs the risk of making absolutely nobody happy,"" she says. And both Bond games have to deal with another pitfall: Despite being reliable million-plus sellers, Bond titles generally don't get much respect in the video game world. ""They just were so forgettable,"" G4's Webb says of 007's past gaming ventures. ""They didn't really appeal to the core gamer."" With a few exceptions, most notably the original ""GoldenEye"" game and 2003's ""Everything or Nothing,"" too many previous Bond games suffered from uninspired gameplay, recycled storylines and a rushed, thrown-together feel. That spotty record might make gamers wary of giving 007 another shot. Still, the makers of the new Bond games are confident there are enough Bond-deprived fans out there to make ""Blood Stone"" and ""GoldenEye"" hits. The question now is: Will those folks who can't see Bond on the silver screen be satisfied to play Bond on their video-game consoles?","Two new video games reboot the James Bond movie franchise with Daniel Craig's likeness .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A suicide bomber wearing an explosives-packed vest attacked a police recruitment center in northern Iraq Tuesday, a bloody strike that killed at least 65 people and wounded 160 others. The attacker -- who blew himself up when he was among hundreds of recruits -- staged the assault at a checkpoint where people usually wait their turn to enter the center. The explosion caused a fire at a fuel station nearby, police in Tikrit said, and most of those killed and wounded were young men who came to join police forces. Tikrit's general hospital was overwhelmed with wounded people, some of whom had to be sent to hospitals in nearby towns of the Salaheddin province and to other locations, such as Irbil and Kirkuk. Salaheddin Deputy Governor Ameen Mohammed told Iraqiya state TV that security forces in the province are on full alert, and police said the local government announced a three-day mourning period in Salaheddin. Iraqi Prime Nuri al-Maliki wants to get to the bottom of the incident, which he calls the latest of similar ""heinous crimes."" He said it reflects ""clear negligence and a shortcoming by the concerned authorities, so we will follow up this matter with all seriousness in order to determine those who are negligent, particularly those who are responsible of the recruitment cases and those who are behind today's painful tragedy."" Vice President Tariq Al-Hashimi deplored what he called a ""cowardly"" act. ""This new tragedy added to the tragedies of the unemployment of Iraqi youth,"" al-Hashimi said. The vice president called on authorities to tackle unemployment and to keep young people from sinking into hunger and crime. He also said authorities need to reconsider how to protect recruits at such centers, which he called soft targets. Mosques urged Tikrit residents to donate blood for the wounded. The center is located nearly 100 miles north of Baghdad in Tikrit, the hometown of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, and the facility is in one of Hussein's former palaces. There has been no claim of responsibility but al Qaeda in Iraq, the Sunni Muslim-dominated militant group, has frequently claimed responsibility for such attacks. Tikrit is largely a Sunni Muslim city. Iraqi recruitment centers have frequently been targeted in warfare over the years. On August 17, 48 were killed when suicide bombers attacked a military recruitment center in the Bab al-Moudham commercial area of central Baghdad. The same center was attacked again in September, and 12 people were killed. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group for al Qaeda in Iraq and other Sunni extremist groups, claimed responsibility for that bombing, authorities said. U.S. troops have ended their combat mission in Iraq and have focused on training and advising. But they feel the violence that occasionally erupts. On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed, two in northern Iraq and another in the central part of the country. Under a U.S.-Iraqi security agreement, all U.S. troops are to leave Iraq by the end of the year. There are fewer than 50,000 American service members there now.

"(CNN) -- Eleven people were killed and 29 injured during a stampede at an election rally for Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, officials said. The stampede happened during a rally at Port Harcourt stadium in the country's southern delta, Rivers state spokesman Rita Inoma-Abbey told CNN. The area is the president's home turf and a main area of support. A presidential spokesman said that Jonathan has called for a full-scale investigation into the cause of the stampede. The president ""has received with shock and sadness, news of the unfortunate loss of lives"" at the stadium, Ima Niboro said. ""I am sad, and heavily weighed down by this incident. It is sad, unfortunate and regrettable. I mourn with those who mourn tonight. May God grant us all the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss,"" Jonathan said. The stampede follows what has been an imperfect start to Jonathan's campaign. At his first campaign stop in Nassarawa state, youths defaced his posters, burned tires, and two people were killed in the confusion. At another stop in Kano, supporters walked out before his speech, and in Ogun state he was criticized for calling opposition candidates ""rascals.""","A stampede at an event for President Goodluck Jonathan killed 11 .

"(Fast Company) -- Forget Ashton Kutcher and Lady Gaga. On Twitter, mainstream media outlets such as CNN, the New York Times, and the BBC dominate trending topics. According to a new report by HP, trending topics are not determined by how many followers a user has or how prolific a tweeter that user is. After studying a sample of 16.32 million tweets during the fall of 2010, researchers discovered that 22 users were the source of most trending topic retweets. (Roughly 31% of tweets about a trending topic are retweets.) Of these 22 influentials, 72% were Twitter accounts run by traditional news organizations, including Reuters and the Washington Post, but other digital-age media outlets such as the Huffington Post were also featured on the top trenders list. (While Lady Gaga didn't make the top rankings, what appears to be some knock-off Twitter feed run by ""Lady Gonga"" did. We snooped around to learn more about @LadyGonga and top result @vovo-panico, but our Portuguese is a bit rough. We reached out to HP to find out why both accounts ranked among some of the world's top news outlets...stay tuned.) However, the report found that social media is not a replacement for news information. ""Twitter users then seem to be acting more as filter and amplifier of traditional media in most cases,"" said Bernardo Huberman, HP Senior Fellow and director of HP Labs' Social Computing Research Group. This is especially true in the wake of the Egyptian unrest, when Twitter hashtags (#Mubarak, etc.) for the protests were constantly trending on Twitter, but filtering users to mainstream media outlets for the most breaking news. Appropriate for the 140-character format, Twitter trending topics disappear almost as fast as they come, suggesting users are hungry for more news. On average, according to HP's report, 40 minutes is the longest time a topic will stay at the top of Twitter's trends. Then how do you account for #JustinBieber?

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama called Wednesday for a series of steps to help Americans conserve and get in touch with nature, including full funding of the $900 million Land and Water Conservation Fund for only the third time in its existence. At a White House event, Obama also proposed creating a Conservation Service Corps to help young people find work in the outdoors, and extending the tax deduction for donating private land for conservation. The proposals are part of an action plan by the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, which Obama launched last year to promote community conservation efforts to protect the nation's natural heritage and help people experience it. ""These are the right steps to take for our environment, but they're also the right steps to take for our country,"" Obama said, citing job creation and economic growth, scientific research and helping American kids experience nature. The action plan calls for creating more urban parks, restoring rivers and creating recreational ""blueways"" -- river trails designed to generate economic activity, and increasing support for protecting rural landscapes. Mindful of the budget battle in Washington, Obama noted that existing government revenue from oil and gas extraction would pay to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fun, which was created in 1965 to help purchase land and water property for conservation. It would be only the third time in history that the fund reached its maximum level of $900 million, Obama said to applause, adding that ""our attitude is if you take something out of the Earth, you have a responsibility to give a little bit back to the Earth."" The Conservation Service Corps would be roughly modeled on the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s to help young Americans find work involving nature and conservation. ""To encourage young people to put down the remote and video games and go outside, we're going to establish a new Conservation Service Corps so they can build a lifelong relationship with their national heritage,"" Obama said to more applause. Every year, America loses about 1.6 million acres of its working farms, ranches and forests to development, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. CNN's Sarah Jones contributed to this story.","President calls for creating a 21st-century conservation ethic .

"(CNN) -- Erin and Raleigh Hill of North Carolina kept their $1 million lottery prize to themselves for almost six months, hiding the ticket in an envelope, a Bible, a shoebox and, finally, a work locker until they were ready to cash in. Midafternoon Tuesday, the nervous couple knew they had to face ""the hoopla."" They drove to Raleigh to claim the Mega Million prize that was set to expire at 5 p.m. Wednesday, officials said. That brought an end of recent frantic searches by others through glove compartments, cupboards and wallets -- just in case they had the winning ticket. The Hills each received a lump sum of $340,000 after taxes, the North Carolina Education Lottery said in a statement. The couple purchased the winning Mega Millions ticket at the Market Express in Stallings, near Matthews, in August 2010. Raleigh Hill said he wasn't ready just then to collect the cash and hid the ticket, the lottery said. Winners have 180 days to come forward. Raleigh Hill matched all five white balls (4-13-20-29-48) with a $2 Megaplier ticket, earning an automatic $1 million prize. Raleigh Hill, a baggage handler, waited several weeks after the purchase to tell his wife, Erin, a federal government employee, the lottery said. He informed Erin at the end of a bad day for her. ""Things aren't all that bad,"" he told her as he left the winning ticket on a computer screen after displaying the winning numbers. At one point, Raleigh Hill told lottery officials, he thought he had lost the ticket before remembering it was in the shoebox in a closet. The Hills, who live in Stallings, may buy a new home and take a trip to Ireland because of Erin Hill's heritage, the lottery said. CNN left messages Tuesday for the Hills. Esther Roach, store manager at Market Express, told CNN she had gotten about 15 calls in the past two days from people who bought lottery tickets and wanted to the know the address of her store. They may have purchased tickets at multiple locations and were trying to recall whether they had been to the Stallings store. ""Today has been tremendously busy,"" she said Tuesday afternoon before learning the Hills had come forward. ""I barely had time to get my work done today."" The North Carolina Education Lottery says it has advice for people to avoid confusion on whether they are a winner. ""We advise people to sign the back and have a system to keep up with them,"" communications director Van Denton told CNN. Market Express, which won $10,000 for selling the ticket, saw a jump in sales after the lottery announced where the August winner was sold. ""They thought it was a lucky store,"" Roach said. ""It is good for business."" Since its inception in March 2006, the education lottery has provided about $1.76 billion for four school programs. That includes money for school construction, college scholarships for students in need, teacher pay and programs to keep class sizes small, Denton said. If no winner had been certified at lottery headquarters in Raleigh by the deadline, the $1 million prize would have been split between education and a fund to pay down a Medicaid shortfall in North Carolina. According to the lottery, a Winterville man had less than two full business days left before his $200,000 Powerball ticket was set to expire January 4, 2009. The ticket had been sitting on his dresser since he purchased it, completely forgotten about until a friend from Greensboro heard of the missing ticket and called to ask if he had ever checked his. The largest prize that went unclaimed was a $800,000 Powerball ticket sold in April 2008.","Couple from Stallings, North Carolina, claims $1 million Mega Millions prize .
