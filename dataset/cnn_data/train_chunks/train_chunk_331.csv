"Cairo (CNN) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have agreed to extend the current Gaza cease-fire by 24 hours, Gamal Shobky, the Palestinian Authority ambassador to Egypt, said Monday. An Israeli government official confirmed the extension to CNN. The cease-fire is now set to expire at midnight Tuesday ( 5 p.m. ET). The extension gives negotiators more time to talk about the issues for a lasting peace in Gaza. ""There hasn't been any progress at all,"" Azzam al-Ahmed, the lead Palestinian negotiator, told reporters. Israeli and Palestinian media had reported Monday afternoon that a deal was set to be signed. Israel's Channel 10, quoting Palestinian sources, said the agreement would include the easing of Gaza border restrictions and enlargement of the fishing zone off the Gaza coast. Bigger issues -- including demilitarization, the building of a seaport, the release of Palestinian prisoners and the return of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers -- will be discussed at fresh talks in a month's time, Channel 10 said. Palestinian news agency Ma'an reported that Egyptian consultants were drawing up the documents and that Israel's delegation had left Cairo to discuss the deal with Israel's Cabinet. But talks will continue. ""We hope that every minute in the next 24 hours will be used so we can reach an agreement or the cycle of violence will continue,"" al-Ahmed said. Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, blamed the Israelis for blocking the path to an agreement. He said from Gaza after returning from Cairo that the Palestinian delegation was united. He told CNN by phone that the situation is ""very fragile and very explosive."" Communicating through Egyptian intermediaries, Israel and the Palestinians have been trying to resolve in days issues that have smoldered for decades. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier Monday that Israel was ""prepared for any scenario,"" with the Israel Defense Forces ready ""for a very firm action if fire is resumed."" Israeli forces remain positioned around Gaza. In recent weeks, they carried out aerial and ground assaults against Hamas to try to stop militant rocket fire and destroy a network of more than 30 tunnels that extended under the border into Israel. Operation Protective Edge not over . Israel is calling for Gaza to be demilitarized, demanding that Hamas, which controls the territory, lay down its arms. After meeting with Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon on Monday, Netanyahu reiterated that Israeli negotiators had been ""instructed to insist firmly on Israel's security needs."" The strength of the Israeli military and the Israeli people's patience and perseverance would help bring them peace and security, he said. Yaalon said Operation Protective Edge was not over. ""We are getting ready for the results of the deliberations in Cairo, whether they bring quiet or someone tries to challenge us by escalation,"" he said. ""The IDF is ready and willing to react with power to any development. Hamas will not drag us to a war of attrition, and if they try, they will get back twice as much."" Disarmament? A senior Israeli official told CNN that the most central issue on the table was nonviolence. ""On the basis on nonviolence, if you assume that includes no tunnels, then you would be correct. If you assume that would mean no missiles, then you would be correct,"" he said. The official said the Palestinian delegation was not united and that Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal was calling the shots in Cairo. He pointed to what he said appeared were contradictions coming from the Palestinian side, asking, ""how can Israel have full security while they're still digging terror tunnels and making rockets?"" The Palestinians, he said ""can't cherry pick what they want."" Even during the cease-fire, Hamas has boasted that its rocket-making factories are still operating, replenishing its arsenal. But in the view of Palestinian officials, disarmament is a nonstarter. ""That is not possible,"" Palestinian official Nabil Shaath said. ""Because Israel will not demilitarize either, will not even commit itself that it will never use military arms against Gaza."" Hamas leader Izzat Risheq said the group's weapons were ""for self-defense"" against Israel. ""But when we have our own Palestinian state with its own national army to protect its citizens, there will be no need for any party to carry any kind of weapons,"" he said. 'Impossible demands' Speaking on condition of anonymity Monday, a Hamas leader said the Israelis had ""submitted impossible demands on the Palestinians such as the issue Palestinian demilitarization, destroying the tunnels and the issue of preventing Palestinians from developing their missiles technology."" The Israelis, he said, ""want everything and want to give nothing."" He said the Palestinians had responded with a counterproposal offering Israel ""full security in exchange of full opening of border crossings"" or lifting the siege completely. Palestinians say Israel's blockade is suffocating the economy of the small, impoverished strip of land and the lives of its inhabitants. Among their demands are the rebuilding and reopening of Gaza's airport and the establishment of a seaport. But Israeli authorities -- who retain control of Gaza's airspace, Mediterranean waters and their shared border -- say that releasing their grip on what goes into and out of the territory is too risky, as things stand. ""Building a seaport or an airport in Gaza without demilitarization is like getting a duty-free for rockets and missiles,"" Israeli Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz said. Death toll passes 2,000 . Meanwhile, the total number of Palestinians killed since the start of the offensive has reached 2,016, Ashraf el-Qedra, spokesman for the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said Monday. The latest deaths include people who were found under rubble and those who died from injuries they received during the previous fighting. It's unclear how many of the dead were militants. The United Nations has estimated that about 70% were civilians, but Israel has estimated a higher number of militants. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths, saying militants fire rockets from civilian areas and encourage people to stay despite Israeli warnings of impending attacks. The Israeli military says 64 of its soldiers have been killed, as well as three civilians in Israel. CNN's Ali Younes, Amir Tal, Andrew Carey and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","NEW: 'There hasn't been any progress,' lead Palestinian negotiator complains .

"(CNN) -- The body of a missing pregnant wife of a Marine based in California was found over the weekend and her former neighbor was arrested in connection with her death, police in San Bernardino County said. Erin Corwin, 19 and three months pregnant, had been missing since June 28 after she said she was going to Joshua Tree National Park to scout trails. On Saturday, searchers found her body about 140 feet down a mine shaft but weren't able to recover and identify it until the next day, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said. An autopsy determined Corwin had been killed, the sheriff's department said, without elaborating how she died. On Sunday night, authorities in Anchorage, Alaska, arrested Christopher Lee, who police say had been having an affair with Corwin. CNN affiliate KTLA, citing District Attorney Michael Ramos, reported that charges against Lee will be decided in the next two days. KTLA also reported that it may take four to five weeks before he can be returned to California. The station said Corwin's husband, Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, hasn't spoken publicly about the case. Suspect from the beginning . Corwin didn't go to Joshua Tree National Park on the day she disappeared, police said in a statement of probable cause written in July. Instead her car was found a few miles from where she lived next door to Lee and his wife, Nicole. Detectives found footprints next to Corwin's abandoned car that led to tire tracks. Investigators said those tire tracks were the same width and same width apart as the tires on Lee's Jeep. According to the court document, several people, including a friend of Erin Corwin's in Tennessee, told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair. He admitted to kissing her but told detectives the two had never had sexual intercourse. Lee also told police that on the day Corwin disappeared he had gone hunting. San Bernardino County deputies arrested Lee on July 4 for a felony not related to Corwin's disappearance: possession of a destructive device. KTLA said he posted bail two days later. The search . More than 100 mine shafts were searched before the sheriff's team found Corwin's body. Authorities used cell phone information to narrow the search area to 300 square miles. The area included remote land belonging to the federal government's Bureau of Land Management. On Saturday, searchers went to the Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Rose of Peru mines. KTLA described the area as remote and off a dirt road accessible by four-wheel drive vehicles. Searchers located Corwin by using a camera, the sheriff's department said. Because the body was so far from the surface and the air in the mine was poor, it took another day to get to the body and bring it to the surface.","Former neighbor is arrested in connection with her death, which has been ruled a homicide .

"(CNN) -- Francesco Clark is standing. It's something most of us take for granted, but for him, it's a big deal. ""Three years ago, I could only stand 20 minutes at a time,"" said Clark, 34, who injured his spine 10 years ago. ""Now it's an hour and a half every day."" In 2002, Clark was 24 and had landed a dream job at a major magazine when he took a trip to a summer house just outside New York. It was a perfect summer evening, and the pool was dimly lit. Clark recalls the moment: It was as if the pool was begging him to dive in. Without hesitation, he listened. His chin hit the floor of the pool. ""How can you describe knowing what (being) paralyzed feels like?"" he said. ""I lay underwater completely awake and completely conscious."" ""The first thing I thought was, 'You're an idiot!'"" Approximately 1.3 million people in the United States are living with a spinal cord injury (SCI), according to the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. Most of these injuries affect people between the ages of 15 and 35, the majority of them men. Clark describes spending three years after his injury wallowing in guilt and self-pity. His desire to become who he used to be, he says, helped him find the will to not only move again -- but to move on. Clark's recovery is documented in his book ""Walking Papers."" In the intensive care unit, his prognosis was hopeless. Doctors told his parents that their son would live the rest of his life on a ventilator and never speak. There was no chance of him ever moving anything below his neck. ""The man next door to me was screaming for morphine because he was in the final stages of cancer,"" says Clark. ""The thing that really scared me was that when I got in my room, he had a higher chance of living. It really made me fight."" He attributes this perseverance to his family and their unconditional support. Brain-controlled devices may help paralyzed people . Clark's sister, Charlotte, had just graduated from college when he was paralyzed. She and the rest of his family have helped Clark battle his injury from the start. ""We've come to appreciate early on the small improvements that he makes because they become actually quite big,"" said Charlotte Clark. ""He'll be walking, I know he will be. When it's time, I know his body is going to be ready."" In the months after the accident, Clark pushed his health insurance provider to double his physical therapy sessions and cover more of his therapy equipment. When doctors urged him to just accept that he would never move again, Clark defied the prognosis. Less than a year after his injury, he could feel his shoulders. ""I never wanted to believe that there would never be a cure for SCI. I was showing people how I already defied what my diagnosis meant. So why couldn't I push for more?"" Clark completes five hours of physical therapy a week. While standing, he does cardio for an hour and a half. He lifts weights in his garage. He practices kicking his legs while playing a dance game with his niece. He undergoes electrical stimulation on his hands, legs and abs. On the weekends, he practices lifting his body off his bed. He describes his therapy like training for the Olympics. He was tenacious, pursuing conventional therapies alongside less-proven ones. From stem cell surgery in Beijing to different clinical trials, Clark was fiercely determined to move again. Dr. Manuel Avedissian, a research fellow involved with one of these clinical trials, refers to Clark as his ""star pupil."" ""If there's a door shut for him, he'll check elsewhere,"" said Avedissian. ""He's constantly looking for other things. He wants to make more of a difference than anyone I know."" A tiny step forward for spinal cord injuries . Clark attributes his progress to intense physical therapy and clinical studies, as well as to the stem cell therapy. He describes his motor movement as more fluid and refined; he can now move his toes, stretch his calves and feel hot and cold on his legs. Clark also lost the ability to sweat, which led to flaky skin and chronic acne. So he started experimenting with botanical extracts in his kitchen and developed the Clark's Botanicals skin-care line. ""The power of something as seemingly innocuous as beauty -- the power it has to make you feel strong and empowered -- there's something to be said about that,"" explains Clark. He recalls being afraid of asking what he could do to walk, worrying that people would laugh at him. ""Now I'm not afraid of that, and it's evolving, because I'm feeling more and doing more,"" he says. ""The people who I thought would laugh at me now look at me and say, 'Oh, my gosh, this recovery is incredible.'"" Clark hopes to empower other patients to take control of their recovery. ""Your injury doesn't define you. You will get better,"" he says when asked what he would say to those newly diagnosed with paralysis. ""... You should want more and you should ask the questions that you really want to ask and then find the answers, and don't take anybody's word as truth. Use your curiosity and imagination to benefit your recovery."" Clark is seeking more cutting-edge SCI studies and continues to spread the word as a national ambassador for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. He believes he is ""definitely going to be walking"" in the next five years and hopes to finally take a vacation. Most recently, he says, his feet began sweating, another sign of success. But after his near-death experience, his priority is to just be happy. Hearing that something is impossible ""doesn't make sense to me anymore,"" he says. ""I was three breaths away from dying ... It's about prioritizing what's important to you. My priority is being happy and feeling fulfilled. It's more about giving back to a bigger community with the experience that I have.""","Francesco Clark injured his spine at age 24 in a diving accident .

"(CNN) -- It's not clear who might try to succeed Jan Brewer as governor of Arizona next year, but chances are good that whoever it is won't be quite as flamboyant. The finger-wagging, gun-loving politician, known as a firebrand who exhibits flashes of moderation, announced on Wednesday that she would ""pass the torch of leadership"" and not run for reelection. Her term ends in January. Feisty on immigration . A feisty Republican who rose up through local politics to the state's highest office, Brewer generated national headlines in recent years for her public opposition to President Barack Obama on border security and immigration reform. ""First entering public service as a mother concerned about the workings of her local school board, Governor Brewer has served with distinction at every level of state and local government over the last three decades,"" veteran Republican Sen. John McCain said Wednesday, calling her ""a great champion for our state."" As secretary of state, Brewer automatically ascended to the gubernatorial gig in 2009 when Gov. Janet Napolitano left the job to head the Department of Homeland Security under Obama. Brewer then easily won election to a full term in 2010. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer won't seek reelection . Just over a year into her tenure, she rose to national prominence by signing SB1070 into law. The strict immigration measure, also known as the ""show me your papers"" act, allowed law enforcement to ask people for legal documents. ""Show me your papers"" law . Critics complained the measure would lead to racial profiling, and the U.S. Supreme Court eventually struck down some provisions of it but left intact the controversial section allowing police to check immigration status while enforcing other laws. The issue gained Brewer the reputation of conservative firebrand, and she enhanced it in 2012 when she famously wagged her finger at Obama during a face-to-face encounter on an airport runway when he visited Arizona. In her bid for reelection that year, she won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association even though her primary opponent sat on the organization's board of directors. The NRA gave Brewer an A+ rating and under her leadership, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. In addition, people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed. Inside Politics: Is Brewer part of a GOP evolution? However, her conservative credentials took a hit in 2013 when she decided Arizona would participate in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. A moderate side . Some other conservative governors chose for their states to opt out instead of accepting federal money to pay for the expansion, but Brewer called it a ""moral"" obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured. In February, Brewer vetoed a controversial state bill that would have allowed business owners asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. If she had accepted the measure, Arizona could have faced litigation and a boycott, potentially harming Arizona's economy and tourism industry as well as the 2015 Super Bowl to be played there. Protesters celebrate Ariz. governor's veto . Brewer cited the business community's opposition to the bill in announcing her veto. Arizona law dictates that a governor can't run for more than two consecutive terms, and her time in office before she was elected in 2010 would count as a full four-year term. Differing opinions exist on whether Brewer could be eligible, but she made clear Wednesday she would step down, vowing to ""work until my final hours completing the people's business."" ""Both my pen and my veto stamp have plenty of ink,"" she said. CNN's Leigh Ann Caldwell, Dana Bash, Miguel Marquez and Quand Thomas contributed to this report.","Jan Brewer, who took on President Obama over homeland security, will not seek reelection .

"London (CNN) -- Imagine a skyscraper that cleans the air. You won't have to wait long -- two will soon be built in China. The world's tallest towers, futuristic pink spires that ""breath life"" into the environment, are due to begin construction within two years. The ambitious Phoenix towers were designed by London-based architects Chetwoods and will claim the tallest building title from Dubai's Burj Khalifa. And the design goes one step further: The towers will be one of the world's most environmentally-friendly buildings. Stretching up more than a kilometer into the skies above Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, the Phoenix project aims to clean the air and water from its surrounding areas. It's expected to become a tourist attraction for both Chinese and international travelers. Chetwoods chairman Laurie Chetwood told CNN the project is more than just an architectural statement. It's also about preserving the lakes of the region, he said. ""You can imagine the pressure those lakes are under, [with] a huge dense city growing around them,"" he said. ""So we thought we could not only attract attention with the towers but also breathe life, literally, into the lakes."" The architects have looked to the natural world for inspiration, building a ""thermal chimney"" in the center of the taller tower. The chimney, heated by the sun, will draw air from across the lakes and use it to cool the buildings. The air will then be filtered and churned back into the environment cleaner than before. The buildings will do the same with the water, tantamount to ""putting air back into the water like in a typical fish tank.... but we're also cleansing the water and putting it back,"" Chetwood said. The towers have also drawn on Chinese culture, reflecting its use of the phoenix as a metaphor. ""It's two dragons or two birds -- one male, one female -- and we use this idea as a symbiotic idea, one feeding off the other for the benefit of all."" The taller of the two towers will accommodate a kaleidoscope, turned by a wind turbine, and creating what Chetwood hopes will be a ""wonderful experience when you look up."" Combined with photovoltaic panels, they produce electricity for the project -- with some spare for the district. The smaller tower will feature the world's tallest ""green wall,"" or vertical garden, which will climb to the top of the tower. But perhaps the most controversial architectural feature are the huge celestial orbs strung between the two towers, housing restaurants and viewing platforms. The designs are unusual, the ""sort of idea that China embraces, that perhaps somewhere else in the world they think you're going too far there,"" Chetwood said. The towers will glow in vibrant pink, as a nod to the fuchsia flower. While architects often pivot to monochromatic colors, Chetwood wanted to mix it up with color. Also, he adds, ""I hold my hands up and say I actually like the color and thought it would look stunning."" Constructions starts in 2016, and the aim, Chetwood said, is for people to ""have their breath taken away.""","The world's next tallest building is being built in China, and the two towers will clean the air around them .
The Phoenix project has been designed by London-based architects Chetwoods, building will begin 2016 .

"(CNN) -- It was one of the hottest films out of Sundance, but ""Blackfish"" will leave you with chills. The nearly 90-minute documentary tells the story of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was killed in 2010 when the killer whale Tilikum grabbed her and yanked her underwater. The exclusive clip above depicts another trainer getting her arm broken by a whale. ""I became interested in this project when I found out about the death of Brancheau,"" filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite said. ""I was very confused by that story, because I didn't understand why a killer whale who was a very highly intelligent animal would have made a decision to kill a trainer that was actively feeding it."" The result of Cowperthwaite's curiosity is a film that raises a number of questions, not the least of which being whether killer whales have any place in theme parks. Critics have praised ""Blackfish"" for being an ""emotionally powerful"" and ""mesmerizing psychological thriller"" that could double as a teaching tool. The documentary arrives in select theaters on July 19, and it will also air on CNN as part of CNN Films on October 24 at 9 p.m. ET. To unravel what happened between the 12,000 pound Tilikum and Brancheau, Cowperthwaite also takes us through the 39-year history of orcas in captivity. Although Brancheau's story is at the heart of the film, ""Blackfish"" also shows more generally the dangers of working with orcas and their majestic beauty and intelligence. ""For anyone who has ever questioned the humaneness of keeping wild animals in captivity and training them to perform tricks for food, this will be trenchant, often harrowing stuff,"" The Hollywood Reporter said in its Sundance review. ""Perhaps even more so for those who have never considered the issue.""","""Blackfish"" examines the 2010 incident when a killer whale killed its trainer .

"(CNN) -- The mosque in Roxbury was crowded past capacity, with about 1,200 college students, urban hipsters and East Africans lining the hallways and front stairs. They wanted to hear Imam Suhaib Webb, resident scholar of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center and widely considered one of the country's most influential Muslims, respond to Sam Harris and Bill Maher, who recently called Islam the ""mother lode of bad ideas"" and compared Muslims to the Mafia. The lanky, blue-eyed imam, a convert originally from Oklahoma, is known for tackling taboo topics and spicing his sermons with pop culture references. Before Friday's sermon, the last time the Roxbury mosque had been this crowded, Webb said, was when he preached about the finale of ""Breaking Bad."" (On the Sunday after his sermon, Webb, who has extensive training in classical Islamic learning, answered religious questions on Twitter about ""The Walking Dead."") Instead of attacking Maher and Harris, though, Webb challenged his fellow Muslims. ""It's code red,"" he preached last Friday, pounding the minbar for emphasis. ""People do not like us, and we need to get with it!"" ""One day we're attacked by Fox News, the next day we're attacked by Muslims who actually pay to have Facebook ads about us,"" Webb said. ""I mean, that's the level of attacks that we're dealing with as a community and as a people. One brother told me, like what's going to happen next? It's like a soap opera."" Webb himself has been subject to some of those attacks, as conservative media outlets have sought to tie him to Alton Nolen, an Oklahoma man accused of beheading a co-worker, and the Tsarnaev brothers, suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing. Webb said he never met the three men. ""It's guilt by nonassociation,"" he said with a sardonic laugh. At one point during his sermon last Friday, a man interrupted to argue that Muslims shouldn't care about what others say about them. But when even avowed liberals like Maher and Harris lash out against Islam, Webb said, then it's time to worry. ""The last bastion of support we'll find in this country are among the liberals and some moderately conservative people,"" Webb said. ""What happened on that show that night was to challenge that community and its traditional support of religious minorities in this country, and if we don't think that's something we should be worried about, then basically we are building our own coffins."" Those are strong words, Webb acknowledged in a phone interview after his sermon, which was posted on YouTube last Friday. But necessary ones for American Muslims, who find themselves caught between Islamophobes and Islamists like ISIS, he said. ""No community survives that fails to identify itself,"" Webb said, ""and right now the rhetoric and the perception of the Muslim community, whether we believe it or not, is not very good."" Instead, American Muslims frequently find themselves judged by how Islam is practiced overseas: stories about the group calling itself Islamic State, death sentences in Sudan, and restricted rights for women in Saudi Arabia. ""What is constantly invoked is that Muslims are bad because of what is happening overseas, or Muslims are good because of what is happening overseas,"" Webb said. ""In other words, we are being measured and weighed and determined by events that are completely outside of our hands."" Webb challenged Muslims to assert control of their image in three ways: by forging an American-Islamic identity, building institutions and shifting away from the view that male scholars have the final view on the faith. ""We need to appreciate the value of being seen as trusted ... that's the key to having a license to speak about religion,"" Webb said. ""It's a beautiful thing in this country: that if you want to talk about God, you have to be someone who has a certain type of character."" You can view Webb's full sermon here. In addition to his role as resident scholar at Boston's Islamic society, he is also founder of the Ella Collins Institute.","Bill Maher and Sam Harris set off a fierce debate about Islam .

"(CNN) -- The chilling sound of multiple gunshots shattered the relative quiet of the school day at Sandy Hook Elementary School at around 9:30 Friday morning -- children screaming, then silence, as teachers did their best to protect their students and keep them quiet, hoping desperately the shooter would not find them. This is a morning no one in this small town in Connecticut will ever forget; the morning a gunman forced his way into the school and killed 26 people -- six adults and 20 children, all under the age of 10; the last morning some Newtown, Connecticut, parents would see their kids alive. As the community reels, organizations are setting up ways to help through donations and support. An official fund for victims' families, and the community as a whole, has now been established: The Sandy Hook School Support Fund, set up by the United Way of Western Connecticut will provide support services to families and the community. All donations to this fund will go directly to those affected. The Red Cross has also been on the ground, offering food and water to affected families and first responders, and providing more than 50 units of blood to Danbury hospital where some of the victims were transported. They have set up a center for emergency grief counseling - and more than 100 Red Cross workers, including mental health professionals, are on the ground in Newtown helping to support the community. The Red Cross stresses it has what it needs to support efforts in Newtown, and is asking that those wishing to donate to families and the community, direct their contributions to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund. In addition, the nonprofit mental health clinic Newtown Youth and Family Services is providing counseling for families, community members and school staff. They say no appointments are needed and those needing help may walk in. All donations made to them at this time will go to helping those impacted. The Newtown Parent Connection has also pledged to try and bring in extra counselors to help parents cope. Some private funds have also been set up in the wake of the tragedy to help victims. The Newtown Memorial Fund is taking donations for the families and community affected, and is also actively recruiting volunteers and offers of help of all kinds. Facebook pages and websites have also been set up to help the families of Emilie Parker (6), Olivia Rose Engel (6), Noah Pozner (6), and Daniel Barden (7), who were killed at Sandy Hook. The band OneRepublic has also started a fund to raise money for those affected. You can find details on how to donate to OneRepublic's fund here. The organization 'Lutheran Church Charities' has sent a team of 'comfort dogs' to the community. Chewie, Barnabas, Hannah and others will be visiting schoolchildren, attending funerals and memorial services, and will be at the memorial area. You can donate to help support the dogs' visit to Newtown here. For families from the Newtown area, and even beyond, a pressing problem will be how to help children cope with the aftermath of this tragedy -- and indeed how to give parents space to grieve, knowing their children are being looked after. To that end, Save The Children has opened a ""child-friendly space"" in Newtown to give kids a place to play and express themselves while parents seek support or counseling. The space is located in Newtown's Reed Intermediate School, where students of Sandy Hook elementary go after graduating. In addition, Save The Children has released 10 tips for parents wondering how to help their children deal with their feelings about such a traumatic event, such as spending extra time with your kids, and limiting TV time. A number of other organizations, such as the National Association of School Psychologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have released recommendations for parents and teachers as to how to support children if they want to talk about what happened. The US Postal Service has added a PO Box for those who wish to send letters of condolence to the residents of Newtown. Please address mail to: Message of Condolence, PO Box 3700, Newtown, CT 06470. You can also send words of support and messages for families affected in an evergram here. They will be collated and given to the families in the future. The Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection says anyone wishing to volunteer should call 211 or (800) 203-1234.","Official fund for victims' families in Newtown established .

"(CNN) -- The world is focused on forging a durable agreement to prevent Iran from developing a single nuclear weapon. While critically important, these efforts ignore a far greater danger: the thousands of weapons that already exist. There are today more than 17,000 nuclear warheads, an ongoing existential threat to human survival that has largely been ignored since the Cold War ended two decades ago. And, unlike Iran, there are no comparable negotiations under way to deal with these far more dangerous arsenals. In fact, the humanitarian consequences of even a limited nuclear war, such as a conflict in South Asia between India and Pakistan, involving just 100 Hiroshima-size bombs -- less than 0.5% of the world's nuclear arsenal -- would put 2 billion people's lives and well-being at risk. The local effects would be devastating. More than 20 million people would be dead in a week from the explosions, firestorms and immediate radiation effects. But the global consequences would be far worse. The firestorms caused by this war would loft 5 million tons of soot high into the atmosphere, blocking out sunlight and dropping temperatures across the planet. This climate disruption would cause a sharp, worldwide decline in food production. There would be a 12% decline in U.S. corn production and a 15% decline in Chinese rice production, both lasting for a full decade. A staggering 31% decline in Chinese winter wheat production would also last for 10 years. The resulting global famine would put at risk 870 million people in the developing world who are already malnourished today, and 300 million people living in countries dependent on food imports. In addition, the huge shortfalls in Chinese food production would threaten another 1.3 billion people within China. At the very least there would be a decade of social and economic chaos in the largest country in the world, home to the world's second largest and most dynamic economy and a large nuclear arsenal of its own. A nuclear war of comparable size anywhere in the world would produce the same global impact. By way of comparison, each U.S. Trident submarine commonly carries 96 warheads, each of which is 10 to 30 times more powerful than the weapons used in the South Asia scenario. That means a single submarine can cause the devastation of a nuclear famine many times over. The United States has 14 of these submarines, plus land-based missiles and a fleet of strategic bombers. The Russian arsenal has the same incredible overkill capacity. Two decades after the Cold War, nuclear weapons are ill-suited to meet modern threats and cost hundreds of billions of dollars to maintain. There is a growing global movement to prevent such a catastrophe. In 2011, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement called for its national societies to educate the public about these humanitarian consequences and called for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Seventeen nations issued a joint statement in May 2012 on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons that called for their total elimination. By this fall the number rose to 125 nations. The international community should continue to take practical steps to prevent additional countries from acquiring nuclear weapons. But this effort to prevent proliferation must be matched by real progress to eliminate the far greater danger posed by the vast arsenals that already exist. Simply put, the only way to eliminate the threat of nuclear war or risk of an accidental launch or mishap is to eliminate nuclear weapons. This past year the majority of the world's nations attended a two-day conference in Oslo, Norway, on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear war. The United States and the other major nuclear powers would not attend this meeting. There will be an important follow-up meeting in Mexico in February. America should lead nuclear weapons states in attending and embrace the call to eliminate nuclear weapons.

"(CNN) -- Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has been arrested on charges of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance, police said. He was arrested Sunday and is being held at the Hamilton County Jail in Indiana on $22,500 bond, said Lt. Joe Bickel of the Carmel, Indiana, Police Department. A department news release says police stopped Irsay at 11:41 p.m. Sunday in Carmel for driving slowly, stopping in a roadway and failing to use his turn signal. He failed roadside field sobriety tests, and a search of his vehicle found prescription drugs in pill bottles, police said. The drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles in the vehicle, the release said. CNN first learned about Irsay's arrest on Twitter. NFL Senior Vice President of Communications Greg Aiello confirmed to CNN that the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel, making Irsay subject to disciplinary measures. ""We are gathering information at this time regarding last night's incident involving Jim Irsay,"" the Colts said in a prepared statement Monday.

"(CNN) -- Forget the burned jerseys. Never mind The Letter. LeBron James won titles in Miami but his heart was in Cleveland, and he's ready to go home. James told Sports Illustrated for an essay published Friday that he'll leave the Miami Heat for the Cleveland Cavaliers -- a sensational return to his home region that he devastated when he left via free agency in 2010. ""I always believed that I'd return to Cleveland and finish my career there,"" the four-time NBA MVP said in a piece he wrote with SI's Lee Jenkins. ""I just didn't know when."" ""I looked at other teams,"" the 29-year-old wrote, ""but I wasn't going to leave Miami for anywhere except Cleveland. The more time passed, the more it felt right. This is what makes me happy."" No terms were released, and the Cavs said no contract had been signed as of early Friday afternoon. When James will sign the contract has yet to be determined, Cavaliers Senior Vice President Tad Carper said. Numerous reports say that the maximum salary in the first year of a contract for an 11-year NBA veteran, like James, is $20.64 million, though there are exceptions. His move marks the end of a four-year partnership with stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami -- a run that saw James get his first two NBA titles. But the return to the Cavaliers, which drafted James in 2003, allows the prodigal son and his native community to reconnect after a separation that shook both. The lakeside city that is long starved for a professional sports championship embraced him Friday. How James is going to make $1 billion . Fans drove past his Cleveland-area home and honked horns after the news spread. Patrons at a restaurant gushed when a reporter asked what they thought of the move. ""LBJ's coming home! Can't wait! Championship!"" a man told CNN affiliate WEWS. ""Cleveland fans are trying to figure out how to unburn their LeBron jerseys,"" Twitter user nic_johnston44 wrote. Pat Riley, the Heat president who lured James away in 2010, said Friday that although he was disappointed, ""no one can fault another person for wanting to return home."" ""The last four years have been an incredible run for South Florida, Heat fans, our organization and for all of the players who were a part of it. LeBron is a fantastic leader, athlete, teammate and person, and we are all sorry to see him go,"" Riley said. What about The Letter? ""We've talked it out"" In 2010, James and marquee free agent Bosh left their teams to join Wade in Miami -- with James, looking for NBA championships, famously announcing his move in an ESPN special called ""The Decision."" After reaching four straight NBA finals with Miami, James exercised his contract option this summer to become a free agent two years early. James was a Cleveland hero, growing up some 45 miles away in Akron and starring seven years with the Cavs. But his 2010 departure -- and the way he did it, telling ESPN that he was ""taking my talents to South Beach"" -- rankled the people of Cleveland, with fans burning James jerseys and stomping on his likeness. Internet responds with LeBron memes . If those fans torched the figurative bridge, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert vaporized it with a scathing letter blasting James' ""cowardly betrayal"" and, in a forecast that didn't quite pan out, promising that the Cavs would win an NBA title ""before the self-titled former 'king' wins one."" How could James return to the team after that? ""I've met with Dan, face-to-face, man-to-man. We've talked it out,"" the Sports Illustrated story reads. ""Everybody makes mistakes. I've made mistakes as well. Who am I to hold a grudge? He also addressed Cleveland fans' negative reaction to his Miami move. ""It was easy to say, 'OK, I don't want to deal with these people ever again.' But then you think about the other side,"" he wrote. ""What if I were a kid who looked up to an athlete, and that athlete made me want to do better in my own life, and then he left? How would I react?"" Twitter reacts . So he felt OK to return to Cleveland, where he feels he has unfinished business. In his first Cavs stint, he won two league MVP awards and went to the NBA finals once, but won no ring. The interest was mutual, and the Cavaliers made their intentions known when they shipped off Jarrett Jack, Sergey Karasev, Tyler Zeller and a future first-round draft pick to clear the salary cap space necessary to sign James. James joins a Cavaliers team that has struggled, making no playoffs and picking first three times in the NBA draft since James' departure. Those picks were two-time All-Star guard Kyrie Irving, UNLV's Anthony Bennett and University of Kansas phenom Andrew Wiggins, all currently in Cleveland's possession. James: Miami was ""almost like college"" In the SI piece, James said he'd still have left for Miami if he had to do it all over again. It could be described as the college experience that he never had. ""Miami, for me, has been almost like college for other kids,"" James, who went pro straight out of high school, said in Sports Illustrated. ""These past four years helped raise me into who I am."" His ties to his home, he said, pulled him back. ""My relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball. I didn't realize that four years ago. I do now."" Bringing trophy to Cleveland ""most important"" James' Instagram account Friday had a photo, showing him in a Cavaliers jersey, said: ""I'm coming home."" In the SI piece, James wrote that his ""goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question."" ""But what's most important for me is bringing one trophy back to Northeast Ohio,"" he wrote. ""I'm not promising a championship. I know how hard that is to deliver,"" James added. ""We're not ready right now. No way. Of course, I want to win next year, but I'm realistic. It will be a long process, much longer than it was in 2010."" White House takes notice . The news generated intense interest as soon as it broke, around 12:30 p.m. ET Friday. Three of the top 10 trending terms on Twitter were almost instantly related to James. It even came up in the daily press briefing at the White House. When asked, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he didn't know if noted NBA fan President Obama had a reaction to James' move. But Earnest added: ""The fact that he has made this decision is a testament to the kinds of values that he has incorporated into his life and he says that he is interested in instilling in his children."" ""I think it is a pretty powerful statement about the value of a place that you consider home,"" Earnest said. Professional athletes weighed in. From Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson on Twitter: ""Congrats to my man @KingJames on Cleveland! Too bad we don't have the #Sonics #NoPlaceLikeHome."" Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Torrey Smith said on Twitter: ""I'm happy Lebron is going to CLE....not that he owes anyone anything but he means more to that city than anywhere else in the world!

"(CNN) -- When Cathy Sarubbi's first child was born, she could have never imagined the girl would grow up to become a U.S. Paralympian who competed in Vancouver and trained for Sochi. She couldn't dream of anything for her daughter because she didn't know if the baby would even live through the night. In the weeks leading up to the delivery, excitement was building for the first grandchild on one side of the Sarubbi family, and the third on the other: 150 family and friends feted her with a baby shower at The Tamaqua, a neighborhood bar owned by her husband's family for three generations. Sarubbi lives in a tight-knit community in Brooklyn called Gerritsen Beach. Surrounded by water on three sides, it is as small-town as you can get inside a borough with a population of more than 2 million. It is where I grew up (I knew the Sarubbi family growing up, but wasn't aware of Caitlin's story until now). The big day finally arrived. After three or four normal sonograms, Sarubbi, then 27 years old, went into labor. ""And out comes the baby, and the room goes quiet,"" she said during a recent interview. The doctors and nurses were stunned. In fact, a neonatalogist told Sarubbi that he had never seen anything like it in over 20 years of practicing, the mother of five told me. Her daughter, who would be named Caitlin, was born with no eyelids, underdeveloped ears and other facial deformities. Her vision was dramatically impacted because amniotic fluid inside the womb damaged her corneas. Sarubbi, who had to be rushed into the operating room after delivery because she was hemorrhaging, didn't see her baby until 12 hours later. She remembers the maternity nurse who took her to see Caitlin for the first time. "" 'Now you stop your crying, you get on your knees and you pray. ... Let's go mama,' "" Sarubbi said the nurse told her. ""She gave me that smack in the face I needed."" The doctors told her Caitlin might die, become mentally challenged or legally blind. ""They didn't know what to do so they just put her under the jaundice lights,"" she said. When someone dropped a tray, and Caitlin jumped, she and her husband knew their baby could hear sounds and decided they had to get her into a hospital with more specialized care. ""It's been pretty much a miracle ever since."" 'She was fully accepted' When Caitlin was just 3 days old, she had the first of some 70 surgeries she would have over the next 24 years. Doctors determined she had Ablepharon Macrostomia Syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by various physical abnormalities that could affect the head and facial area, the skin, and fingers, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders. After nearly 10 weeks in the hospital, Caitlin, who is called Caitie by her family and friends, came home. ""And it was like the floodgates of Gerritsen Beach opened,"" said Sarubbi, remembering the love and support she received, especially that first time she walked baby Catie in a stroller down the main avenue running throughout the community. ""She was fully accepted, so that gave us strength to put her out in the world ... and it didn't stop."" It didn't stop, indeed. Caitlin, who is legally blind and partially hearing impaired, would go on to ski in the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver and get into Harvard University, where she is studying social and cognitive neuroscience. She got her Harvard admissions letter and her nomination letter to the U.S. ski team in the same week during her senior year in high school. ""It was just so powerful for me because this was years of work and sacrifice, and to have it all come together in this one, two, three day span, it was like wow, this actually happened. This was all worth it,"" Caitlin told me during an interview. She owes everything to her mom, and her dad John, a New York City firefighter, she said. ""If it wasn't for them ... I wouldn't be here today because so many other people could have (broken) under that kind of pressure and that kind of decision making,"" she said. ""My syndrome is so rare. ... It wasn't even something that they had a plan of action for from previous examples."" A passion grows out of tragedy . New York communities were hit hard by the September 11 terror attacks, including Gerritsen Beach, which is home to many firefighters. The inlet community lost residents, including two members of the New York City Fire Department. Charitable offers to firefighters to attend concerts and meet celebrities poured in, and John Sarubbi, deeply in pain, turned them all down, his wife said. Disabled Sports USA, a group that tries to help people with disabilities live full lives through sports, offered an all-expenses paid trip to Breckenridge, Colorado, to John and Cathy along with 11-year-old Caitlin and their three other children at the time. Cathy jumped at the chance, but John was reluctant, thinking it was a scam to commit the family into buying something. ""Johnny's like, 'I'm not going. It's a time-share spiel,' "" said Cathy. But they went. Four years later, John received a lifetime achievement award from Disabled Sports USA. Now he travels to Colorado every year to volunteer along with his entire family. Besides inspiring the Sarubbis to give back through volunteering, that trip did something else. It gave birth to Caitlin's love affair with ski racing. At first, Caitlin was a bit of a chicken on the mountain, she said, but over time she got more aggressive, and decided to give racing a try when the Adaptive Sports Foundation, a group the family volunteers with in Windham, New York, started a race team and asked her to join. ""I did like the feeling it gave you, like a freedom,"" said Caitlin. ""And then I just fell in love with racing because it was a controlled environment to be out of control almost."" Always reaching higher . As a super high-achiever, who took Advanced Placement courses in high school even while missing up to 10 weeks of classes to train, she set her sights on the next big goal. ""What's the next thing I can do, what's the next thing I can achieve?"" she remembers thinking at the time. ""I need to make the U.S. ski team."" After her first semester at Harvard, Caitlin took 2Â½ years off to train for Vancouver, the site of the 2010 Winter Paralympics. PHOTOS: Winter Paralympics opening ceremony . Family, friends and other supporters -- 38 people in all -- traveled to cheer on Caitlin at the Games. ""Mostly all of them had known me since I was a baby... so for them to kind of experience that transition with us was kind of incredible,"" said Caitlin, who finished sixth in two races and eighth in another. She would gain national exposure when Procter & Gamble, through its ""Thank You, Mom"" program, saluting the moms behind the athletes, chose to feature her in a campaign, along with four Olympic athletes: speedskater J.R. Celski, moguls skier Hannah Kearney, ice hockey team player Julie Chu and snowboarder Seth Wescott. ""It meant so much that they acknowledged the Paralympics,"" said Caitlin. ""I didn't even get a medal in Vancouver, but they thought my story was good enough to include with these other amazing athletes."" This year, P&G created its first ad specifically for the Paralympics, which Caitlin said is another huge step in putting the Olympics for athletes with disabilities on the map. The Paralympics wrap up Sunday in Sochi. Getting the gold . After 2Â½ years at Harvard, Caitlin decided to make a run for Sochi. She took a year and a half off from school, and moved to Mt. Hood, Oregon, along with her 20-year-old sister Jamie, who would train to be her guide. All visually impaired downhill skiers have a guide, who skis in front of them and helps direct them down the mountain. But during a warm-up run in December, when Caitlin said she was giving it her all, her dream of a second Paralympic run came crashing to an end. She got a concussion during a wipe out, missed five weeks of training and did not secure a spot on the U.S. Paralympic team. The girl who achieved everything she set out to do now faced something she had never faced before. ""This is the first time Caitlin ever set out for anything and it didn't happen,"" said Cathy. In an e-mail to family, friends and supporters, Caitlin told them her Sochi hopes were over, thanked them for their support and then attached an e-mail from the mother of a child who has a disability. ""The e-mail was inspiring. She said I love your story. You gave me so much hope,"" said Caitlin, who is back home in Brooklyn, volunteering with the Adaptive Sports Foundation and looking for internships this summer before returning to Harvard in the fall. ""I kind of attached a little bit of that e-mail and said, 'Listen this is why I want to do it. I want to raise awareness.' "" ""And (if) you look at it from that way, I won. I got the gold medal,"" she told her supporters. ""I don't need to go to Sochi."" What do you think it takes to raise a child with disabilities?

"(CNN) -- He was not able to fulfill his childhood dream of being a pilot, but Ghanaian scientist Dr. Ave Kludze has arguably gone one better: developing and flying spacecrafts for NASA. The moon, Mars and beyond: All are in the sights of Dr. Ave Kludze. The 43-year-old didn't enter orbit when controlling ERBS and TRMM rockets for NASA, instead piloting them from the control center on the ground. Nevertheless from growing up in Ghana to being an astronautical engineer and strategist for NASA, he has had a similarly stratospheric rise to the top. Growing up in Accra, Kludze was fascinated by science and how things worked. ""I was a very curious kid and I always questioned lots of things, and most of my friends I grew up with, they knew that. And my parents, they were a little bit concerned because sometimes I would take apart a lot of things they would not want me to touch,"" he told CNN. When he realized he could not become a pilot because of his eyesight he channeled his energies into studying engineering, moving to the U.S. to complete a course in electrical engineering at Rutgers University. On graduating Kludze initially planned to return to Ghana to develop solar technologies, but then NASA came calling in 1995. ""I never did dream of working for NASA. I admired what they did, but it never did cross my mind. I did not see how a kid like me could work for NASA,"" he said. He commanded his first spacecraft from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and has gone on to develop an extra-vehicular infra-red camera as well as other projects for the space agency. While he didn't return to Ghana as he originally planned, he still believes that his work -- and NASA's -- has had some benefits to his native country and more down-to-earth lives. ""Well, NASA has done a lot for Africans. Maybe Africans they no know that. They have cell phones, glasses, anti-scratch and all those things. We have portable water system that NASA has developed for Africa. They're using it,"" he said. ""And one thing people often forget, NASA doesn't only develop space technology, we also develop aeronautical technology. So when the planes they fly and other flying objects, NASA's technology has been involved in that."" Kludze is also keen to pass on the message that for young Africans, the sky is the limit in terms of what they do with their lives. ""I've learned that being given the freedom to think and think openly helps bring in new ideas. So in community, like in an African communities, I think younger generations and both the old and the young should freely share ideas and break those old barriers. ""So I believe that with some determination and some hard work most of the younger generation can get whatever they want to. They can even go into space, they can do anything.""","American-Ghanaian engineer is one of NASA's top strategists .

"(CNN) -- Here's a question that seems to be lost in the debate over the Scottish independence vote scheduled for September 18: . If Scotland votes to secede, does that open up a spot for another country? And if so -- Scotland, can we take your place? I realize that Americans fought a bloody war of independence from England in the late 1700s, but our rifts have healed over the past 240 years. In 2013, the Pew Research Center reported that England topped America's list of favorite nations, in a near-tie with our beloved northern neighbor, Canada. In the past few years, as America has degenerated into political and economic chaos, it has become increasingly clear that we would be far better off if we apologized for our revolt against the Crown and requested to rejoin the United Kingdom. There are four main ways America would benefit from unification with the UK: Brits have better health, less inequality, excellent manners and -- let's face it -- a superior culture. Let's improve our quality of life by joining them. Want to live longer? Then let's become Stateland â€” the 50-state replacement for Scotland. Brits have greater longevity than Americans, and the British health care system, while far from perfect, is indescribably better than ours. In my visits to the United Kingdom, I've noticed that just about anyone who can afford private health insurance buys it, which allows Brits to supplement their free, government-provided health care. That means there's a baseline of care that every person receives, and if you want something faster or better, you pay for it yourself. Meanwhile, America's needlessly complicated arrangement of government- and employer-provided health care, in a clumsy compromise with insurance companies, costs way more than other developed countries' while producing worse results. Next, Britain is a more equitable society. Although America has a higher GDP per capita, most of us -- that is, the 99% -- are not happy because of our ever-widening wealth gap. Brits have less inequality, and their median incomes (unlike ours) have risen in the past decade. America's middle class used to be the richest in the world; now we're overtaken by Canada. Unless you are the 1% in America, chances are your wages are stagnant. Living a good life -- owning a house and a car and being able to support a family -- seems like a struggle, especially when compared with your parents' generation. Americans could also learn a few lessons from the Brits when it comes to good manners. When I took students with me to film news reports of the 2012 Olympics in London, we dealt with unimaginable crowds on the street, in the shopping centers and on the Tube. Did we hear groans of exasperation when we accidentally bumped into Brits in Parliament Square while trying to get a better view of Big Ben? Never. Did we see looks of frustration when our cameras accidentally knocked into innocent people in Piccadilly Circus? Not even once. This patience and politeness stands in stark contrast to the attitude in big American cities, where cab drivers curse at you just for your mere existence, and TSA agents at American airports compete for the title of Biggest Emotional Abuser. Finally, America would benefit from a closer association with Britain's culture. The country that produced Shakespeare, the world's best storyteller, has also given us some of the best entertainment and media of modern times. Our imitation of British television (e.g. ""The Office"") speaks for itself. Has any band ever topped the Beatles? And nothing against PBS and NPR, but the BBC produces some of the best publicly funded journalism, putting much of the world's radio and television news programs to shame. The world respects the United Kingdom, in part, because the BBC is so trustworthy. That's called soft power. But wait, you ask. What's in it for the Brits? Three things. Natural resources (oh so much land!), the majestic Grand Canyon and a sport called ""American football."" They'll love it. So remember, Americans, if Scotland votes for independence on September 18, let's improve our lives by asking to take their place -- if not officially, then at least in spirit. We hold this truth to be self-evident: Brits have a superior society. Americans claim we don't want a monarchy, but deep down, we're just as hungry as our British cousins for news about Queen Elizabeth, Princes William and Harry, and those adorable royal babies. England, will you take us back?","Scottish is voting on a referendum for independence from England on September 18 .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's Supreme Court has sentenced a South Korean man to life of hard labor for commiting ""hostile acts"" against the country, according to its state-run news agency, KCNA. The South Korean, identified as Kim Jong Uk, averted the death sentence because he allegedly ""repented of his crimes,"" which included an attempt to set up an underground church inside the country, according to KCNA. Kim was charged with state subversion, espionage and anti-state propaganda, agitation and illegal entry into the border. The defendant confessed to the crimes in a trial held May 30, according to KCNA. North Korea is known to push detainees to make false confessions. South Korean officials condemned the sentence, saying that North Korea was ""in serious violation"" of international norms, and urged for Kim's release. ""North Korea did not respond at all to our request for the family and the legal counsel to access Kim Jeong-uk,"" said the Unification Ministry spokesperson. The English spelling of Kim's name varied between KCNA and South Korea's ministry. Kim's previous appearance . KCNA outlined Kim's alleged crimes: ""He committed anti-DPRK religious acts, malignantly hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK overseas and tried to infiltrate into Pyongyang after illegally trespassing on the border for the purpose of setting up underground church and gathering information about the internal affairs of the DPRK while luring its inhabitants into south Korea and spying on the DPRK."" In February, Kim appeared before foreign journalists in Pyongyang and apologized for carrying out ""anti-state"" activities. Kim said he had worked as a missionary for several years on the Chinese side of the border with North Korea, running a church that sought North Korean converts. Missionaries in North Korea . Missionaries have sought to evangelize in North Korea, as the totalitarian country forbids independent religious activities. Although North Korea contains a number of state-controlled churches, they are considered for show to international audiences, according to a report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea. Religion, especially Christianity, is viewed as a political threat because the state does not condone any belief system other than its official state ideology, according to the report. Witnesses claim that underground churches function inside North Korea, according to the U.N. report. Also, missionaries and underground churches have secretly set up in China near the border to aid defectors. North Korea is currently holding Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, who was arrested in November 2012, after entering the city as a tourist. Bae was sentenced in May 2013, accused of trying to topple the North Korean government and bringing religious activities into the country.

"(CNN) -- It is the scenario Brazil had always feared -- the $11 billion party where the neighbors come round and trash your newly spruced up home. Anybody but Argentina, that is the message which is heard loudest in Brazil ahead of Sunday's final against Germany in Rio de Janeiro at the Maracana stadium. Not since 1986 has Argentina triumphed in the World Cup, but that wait could be over should Lionel Messi and co. see off the Germans. Brazil was humiliated by Germany 7-1 in the semifinal -- but an Argentine World Cup final victory might just trump that as an exercise in despair. After defeating the Netherlands on penalties, Argentina is targeting its a third World Cup win after reaching its fifth final. In 1978, Argentina, which hosted the tournament, defeated the Netherlands 3-1 after extra time in the final in Buenos Aires to spark spectacular scenes of celebration. Mario Kempes was the hero, scoring twice against a Dutch side which had lost at the same stage four years earlier against the Germans. Eight years later, Argentina, led by Diego Maradona, reached the final once again where West Gemany was the opposition. In a tight game, Maradona's wonderful pass released Jorge Burruchaga to fire home a dramatic 84th minute winner as Argentina prevailed 3-2. The Germans side, coached by Franz Beckenbauer, got its revenge four years late when it won 1-0 in the final at Italy 1990. Andreas Brehme's late penalty won a game marred by Argentina's ill-discipline and the sending off of two of its players. Maradona, who was then playing at Italian club side Napoli, was left in tears as the Germans danced on the field of Rome's Olympic Stadium with the trophy it had so badly coveted for a third time. It would be 20 years until the two teams met again in the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Maradona, in his role as coach, watched on in horror as his side was thrashed 4-0 and star player Lionel Messi failed to sparkle. Thomas Muller opened the scoring with Miroslav Klose, now the World Cup's all-time leading goalscorer, adding two and Arne Friedrich the fourth. It is Muller which Argentina will have to watch at the Maracana on Sunday with the Bayern Munich star enjoying another impressive tournament. The 24-year-old has already scored five goals in Brazil and is one away from joining Colombia's James Rodriguez as the top scorer on six. Germany, which was beaten in the semifinals in 2006 and 2010, last reached the final in 2002 where it was beaten by Brazil. ""We've got to give our all on Sunday,"" Klose told reporters. ""I know how it feels to lose a final. I want to lift that trophy into the air."" Many of this current crop have grown up together with the likes of goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, midfielders Sami Khedira, Mesut Ozil all progressing from the youth setup. Six of the team which won the European Under-21 Championships in 2009 are set to start against Argentina with Benedikt Howedes, Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels all in the defense. While Joachim Low's side produced a spectacular performance to dismantle Brazil, it has not had a particularly easy ride to the final. After thrashing Portugal 4-0 in the opening fixture, it was forced to come from behind to secure a 2-2 draw against Ghana. A nervy 1-0 win over the USA ensured it finished top of Group G and booked a last-16 tie against Algeria. While Germany was widely expected to win, it was only after extra time that it managed to find a breakthrough. Substitute Andre Schurrle and Ozil scored the goals and although Algeria got one back late on, the Germans held out for a tense victory. The quarterfinal against France, played in the heat of Rio, was a rather turgid affair with Hummels' early header enough to secure a 1-0 win. The 7-1 win over Brazil was achieved after Germany raced into a 5-0 lead by the interval following a mediocre defensive display from the host nation. So poor was Brazil's performance that Muller revealed how the German players made a decision to ease off in the second half so not to embarrass its opponent. ""With the score the way it was, we said we should avoid being arrogant and to refrain from humiliating the opponent,"" he told reporters. ""But that's something obvious. Yes, there was this agreement and it came from the players themselves."" There's little chance of Germany letting up against Argentina when the tournament's top two go head-to-head. Alejandro Sabella, who will leave his role as coach after the final, has led his side through to the final following a hard-fought campaign. In all of its three group games, only one goal separated Argentina from its rivals. After beginning with a 2-1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina, Argentina was made to sweat until the very last minute against Iran before Messi curled home a stunning winner. Against Nigeria, it was given a real fright before edging home 3-2 courtesy of Marcos Rojo's close-range effort. Having topped Group F, Argentina progressed to face Switzerland which was defeated by a goal just two minutes before the end of extra-time. Another 1-0 victory secured a semifinal place as Gonzalo Higuain's strike ensured Belgium was put to the sword. The semifinal showdown against the Dutch was a dull affair with neither side managing to produce its best football. Sergio Romero, the Argentine goalkeeper, became the hero after saving two penalties in the shootout before Maxi Rodriguez struck the winning kick. It sparked wild scenes of jubilation, not just in Sao Paulo but across Argentina where 40 million people celebrated the nation's Independence Day with extra fervor. ""Brasil, Decime Qué Se Siente"" — translated to ""Brazil, Tell Me How It Feels"" -- is the song that has been sung throughout the tournament by Argentine fans confident of their team's success. Much of Argentina's success will depend on Messi -- a man who has already scored four goals in the tournament and will captain the side in his 93rd international appearance. Messi's achievements are well known -- 381 goals in 466 matches for Barcelona, three European Champions League titles and six Spanish La Liga triumphs only tell half the story. Now he is aiming to add to his 42 international goals by inspiring Argentina to the biggest prize of all -- and the one which will surely make him one of the greatest players of all time. No European country has ever won the World Cup in South America -- if Messi gets his own way, that statistic won't change any time soon. As for millions of Brazilian football fans, who had so desperately sought a sixth world crown, Sunday is the party invitation they had could have done without. Rizzoli to referee final . When it comes to famous football referees, Pierluigi Collina -- now retired -- might be the most famous of them all. FIFA chose another Italian, Nicola Rizzoli, to take charge of Sunday's final.

"Washington (CNN) -- Members of the Senate and House armed services committees currently are talking to the Pentagon about the next round of hearings on Afghanistan, trying to coordinate sessions with the U.S. commander there, Gen. David Petraeus. When Petraeus, probably the best-known military man in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, returns to answer questions, the television lights will shine on the four stars he wears on each shoulder. Now a new debate is swirling in Washington, thanks to an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal pushing for Petraeus to get a fifth star, like military giants of the past. ""The U.S. war against terrorism is now the longest war in U.S. history, and Gen. Petraeus has clearly distinguished himself as a leader worthy of the rank held by Gens. MacArthur, Marshall and Nimitz,"" Pete Hegseth and Wade Zirkle, of the group Vets for Freedom, wrote in the Wall Street Journal. Hegseth served in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division and is bound for Afghanistan. Zirkle, a Marine, deployed twice to Iraq. They make the case that Petraeus deserves the higher rank and that others will benefit if he gets it. ""A promotion would properly honor his service -- and it would also honor the troops he leads and has led,"" they write. ""Today's soldiers have fought as valiantly as any in American history, and they deserve recognition of their leaders. Congressional approval of a fifth star would demonstrate the nation's commitment to their mission."" Hegseth aid Thursday that the response to their suggestion has been overwhelmingly positive. He laughed off a question about whether he had heard from Petraeus himself, saying he didn't expect to. ""We're just hoping to gain some traction,"" Hegseth said. He said congressmen already have volunteered to push the promotion forward, although he said he could not provide names. A spokesman for Petraeus would not discuss the idea with CNN. Most senior officers are selected by a promotion board of their peers. But for three-stars and above, the president makes the choice, and the Senate must confirm the decision. Right now, including Petraeus, there are only 12 four-star generals in the U.S. Army. Currently, there is no legislation allowing the appointment of officers to a five-star grade, according to Pentagon information. The last general receiving a fifth star was Omar Bradley in 1950, and it took a special law to make that happen. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, recommended a fifth star during a congressional hearing back in 2008, when Petraeus was leading the surge of troops in Iraq. ""If I could promote you to five stars, I would,"" Graham told Petraeus. The issue prompted tweets to CNN's @natlsecuritycnn account. ""An incredibly silly idea,"" says one answer to the question of the fifth star. ""As much as GOP want to deify him he's not a Washington or a Pershing,"" says another. A supporter tweets, ""He deserves by his achievements."" In the halls of the Pentagon, people shied away from questions. Asked about how the nuts and bolts of the promotion would work, one Pentagon worker admitted that it has been so long since Bradley that he didn't even know whom to call. Another person, back from the battlefield, shrugged it all off. ""Most people do think it's laughable,"" he said. He didn't want to have his name tagged to any comment about a past or future boss. The latest publicity is an echo of a call to elevate Petraeus: a July article in The Atlantic magazine. The author, D.B. Grady, a former Special Forces paratrooper who served in Afghanistan, said that another star for Petraeus would give President Obama a chance to convince the U.S. military and allies that he's committed to the mission in Afghanistan. ""If you are wearing a uniform right now, and I talk to soldiers every day, there's a great deal of fear out there, a great deal of suspicion. President Obama needs a bit of bolstering in the military,"" Grady said. ""Petraeus is deified in the military. It's win-win. With this there is no doubt that the world will appreciate we are taking it seriously in Afghanistan."" Critics of an additional star for Petraeus warn that it could interfere with the chain of command. He would outrank his superior at Central Command, Marine Gen. James Mattis, as well as the Joint Chiefs chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen. But Hegseth says that should cause no problem, that Petraeus' stature already means he has direct contact with the White House and Congress and the secretary of defense. Max Boot in Commentary magazine praises Petraeus but opposes the promotion, saying it would have a negative impact on the chain of command. He suggests waiting. ""I do think that when Petraeus is ready for retirement -- something that I hope will not happen anytime soon -- Congress should consider granting him another star if by that point he has turned around the war in Afghanistan as he did in Iraq,"" Boot writes on commentarymagazine.com. There are no such concerns from Grady. ""It's just the nature of war today,"" he said. ""Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Mattis are on equal footing. ... If Petraeus dropped dead tomorrow, hit by a stray bullet, or retired there is not another unifying force to speak out about the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq. He is the man.""","A Wall Street Journal opinion piece says Petraeus deserves a fifth star .

"(CNN) -- Risking their lives to help disadvantaged Afghans became almost a norm for Tom and Libby Little. ""We raised our three daughters through what was, at times, just hell,"" Libby Little said. ""A hundred rockets a day was a good day."" Family members lived underground to avoid bombings, she said. Yet they stayed out of a love for the people and a passion for providing eye care for the needy. But violence prevailed on Thursday. Tom Little, a New York optometrist, was among 10 people killed by gunmen in Badakhshan, a remote northeastern region of the country. The mostly foreign members of a medical team were robbed and shot one-by-one on a remote road. Their bodies were transferred to Kabul early Sunday, authorities said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. ""He died right where he loved to be -- and that was doing eye care in remote areas,"" Little said from her home in New York. ""Our daughters are missing him terribly. But I think their feeling is, too, that this is a real passion that he had."" More than 400 people gathered Sunday at Loudonville Community Church in Loudonville, New York, to honor Little. The church supported his trip financially and emotionally. ""Four weeks ago, Tom Little stood right here,"" an emotional Stan Key, senior pastor, told the congregation. The church had printed Wednesday in its weekly worship guide, ""Praise the Lord that Tom's ministry in conducting outpatient clinics ... in a remote village was successful. God protected Tom and his team."" Key said he decided to leave it in the guide even after hearing the news of Little's death. Dr. Tom Hale, a medical relief worker himself, told the crowd Little's death was not in vain. ""This was not a waste,"" he said emphatically. ""This is an enormous loss. Many of us are angry."" The British Foreign Office on Sunday confirmed that Dr. Karen Woo was another medical worker killed in the attack. It was the remote areas of Afghanistan, Libby Little said, where the need for her husband's services was often greatest. ""Huge populations were in these remote valleys,"" she said. The Littles would sometimes hike 40 miles one-way -- over mountains -- to access villages to host eye camps. Little said her husband had recently become involved in a program to eradicate preventable blindness by the year 2020. ""There's a lot of preventable blindness in Afghanistan -- blinding eye diseases that can be solved with just very small work,"" she said. Tom Little was heavily involved with training in optometry overseas, ""enabling Afghans to start picking up the work of eye care, because it wasn't there,"" his widow said. His passion for helping Afghans ran deep, she said. ""He would come back to the States and get throw-away optical equipment, then refurbished it, then would send it over to set up a little optical manufacturing factory, so they could make their own eyeglasses there."" When the couple married, they didn't foresee devoting much of their lives in Afghanistan. ""We did feel we wanted to serve God with our lives when we were married. We wanted to serve him. We didn't know what that meant."" So the couple decided to make use of tools and specialties they had -- specifically, Tom's optical tools and Libby's teaching skills -- and took part in a program helping disadvantaged Afghans. ""We went, and we thought it was going to be two years, and it was 33,"" Little said. ""We loved the people. ... The Afghan people were wonderful, absolutely wonderful to us. And they would be the first ones to protect us. So this is not the usual state of things, where they would murder all these people."" Little said warfare in Afghanistan didn't deter her or her husband. ""If you're in medicine, I think you feel you can't leave,"" she said. ""If you're propping up a hospital that's the only hospital, then you can't leave when it gets bad."" Despite the circumstances, Little kept her composure while reminiscing about her husband. ""We had 40 wonderful years together -- of serving together, all those years, doing what we thought we should do. And that's enough for a life.""

"London (CNN) -- For all the recent scaremongering about the viability of an independent Scotland, it's easy to understand why the chance to reclaim a country's sovereignty offers its citizens an exciting prospect. Scotland is, after all, culturally distinct from the rest of the British Isles. And for those Scots aged 16 and 17, who will be given the vote for the first time, the opportunity of creating their own Scottish identity after three centuries of largely English rule must certainly have its own idealistic appeal. But Scotland's bid for freedom will ultimately come down to money -- namely which currency it would use as an independent country. Scotland has four options -- each with their own risks and unknowns. Those who want the country to vote ""yes"" for independence have made clear they wish to keep the pound with the UK's blessing, in a move that would keep the nation inside a stable currency union and also give it a say on interest rates. However this idea has been staunchly rejected by both the British government and the Bank of England, which presumably would be loath to backstop Scotland's massive banks without having a say on their loan books. A separate Scotland could use the UK's currency without its consent -- much in the way that Panama employs the U.S. dollar and similar to how Ireland once pegged itself to the pound. But this strategy could be fraught with dangers. Why? Because Scotland would have no say over borrowing costs that might be out of step with its economic cycle. If Scotland can't keep its place in its existing monetary bloc, it could try to find a place in another one. If the country goes it alone, it can sign up for the euro but Brussels has made it clear that Scotland would have to apply for EU membership first, joining the queue behind places like Serbia and Kosovo. Moreover, independence agitators in Spain's semi-autonomous provinces like Catalonia wouldn't make Madrid look favorably on giving Scotland a spot inside the EU. And -- given the pain we've seen in countries like Spain -- no one knows if the euro will still be around by the time that Scotland does eventually make it into the club. Perhaps the best option for a prosperous Scotland, in the long run, would be the creation of its own currency. Suggestions that have been put forward include reviving the Scottish Ryal -- a coin struck to commemorate Mary Queen of Scots' marriage -- or reintroducing the Groat, in circulation during James III's time. Having their own money wouldn't just give the Scots the full independent identity they crave, it would also give them the financial flexibility a nascent state would need. Still, establishing its worth would be tricky. What's more, Scottish people would have to be convinced of its true worth. And, with almost $200 billion of debt on the line, markets would have to be confident in the country's fiscal planning to lend to it at decent rates. Either way, the value of a new Scottish currency would initially be extremely weak, hitting the people in the pocket first as goods get more expensive. Which is why big names like the ratings agency Standard & Poor's and the French bank Societe Generale have suggested that although a ""Yes"" vote could create a successful Scotland in the long term, for now, a swift, sharp recession could ensue. At least five major banks have drawn up contingency plans to move their legal entities south, with billions under management at stake. Ironically money and politics are supposed to go hand in hand. But when it comes to the Scotland's future as an independent land, they may have to go in opposite directions. Read more: Scotland's vote on independence -- what you need to know .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans, who fervently pound the podium against the deficit, didn't blink Friday at passing a whopping $287 billion business tax cut measure with no effort to pay for or offset that amount. GOP lawmakers argued the bill helps the economy, but budget-watching organizations outside Congress proclaimed it an irresponsible move. The 258-160 vote marked one of the largest unpaid-for measures passed by the House in years, but was also the latest sign that tax cuts are at the center of the Republican universe and the ballyhooed deficit fight is not on the same level as a priority. ""Here in the House, we're doing what we can to help (pass jobs),"" read the statement from GOP House Speaker John Boehner, ""passing another bill today that would create more certainty and give small business owners an incentive to invest and put more Americans back to work."" What $287 billion does . The bill, H.R. 4718, would make permanent something called ""bonus depreciation"": a significant and recent benefit for businesses. Bonus depreciation allows companies to deduct 50% of the value of new equipment or assets in the year they are purchased. It's considered a ""bonus"" because the provision provides a much greater and much faster tax benefit than traditional depreciation. The idea first became law under President George W. Bush in 2002, who said it was meant to be temporary. The tax benefit has been extended repeatedly until the end of last year. At that time, it expired along with a slew of other temporary tax provisions called ""tax extenders"" because they have gone through this process so often. The issue of $287 billion now . The move by Republicans to back $287 billion in tax cuts comes at a time when they are loudly questioning much smaller spending bills: the president's request for $3.7 billion to respond to children crossing the border, $11 billion to keep highway projects afloat for less than a year and the roughly $35 billion Senate measure to revamp the veteran's health care system. Combined, those measures are still less than a fifth of the tax cut bill. ""Wildfire season is approaching and there are not enough resources,"" said Texas Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett during Friday's debate, ""Our highways crumble, bridges literally fall down... While there is so much of vital needs that we just don't seem to have the resources to address, these same Republicans tell us that we can afford to borrow from the Chinese or the Saudis to deliver (tax cuts)."" Should tax cuts be paid for? ""Permanency is something we need to strive for,"" said Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Illinois, on the House floor, arguing that if a tax provision is extended year after year, it should be made into firm law. But that was a change in position from February, when he and other Republicans on the House Ways & Means Committee initially proposed erasing bonus depreciation altogether, a point Democrats stressed. ""The gives inconsistency a bad name,"" said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Michigan, the ranking Democrat on Ways & Means. ""I want to say how appalling it is for Republicans to come forward and say 'let's (push $287 billion) unpaid for.'"" Conservative groups split on the question, with Heritage Action urging Republicans to vote ""yes"" and issuing a blunt statement that cut to the heart of the GOP argument. ""Members should not hesitate to make bonus depreciation permanent,"" the political organization wrote in a statement to Congress. ""Nor should they feel compelled to offer a ""pay for"" as reducing taxes does not require a budget offset. "" That is a central point of debate, should tax cuts require an offset? Is it OK to add the cost of tax cuts to the deficit? While Republicans point to sweeping economic benefits, opponents insist those benefits will never materialize if the tax breaks are made permanent. ""The temporary nature of the break may induce a modest number of firms to accelerate some purchases,"" wrote Chuck Marr, in an analysis for the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that slammed the bill. ""If, however, the tax break is permanent, then there is no incentive for firms to accelerate purchase."" The CBPP called the measure ""irresponsible."" Separately, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has also indicted that the tax cut loses some economic bite when made permanent. The conservative Club for Growth objects to tax extenders in general but did not issue a statement on Friday's vote, because the organization sees it as maneuvering in a predictable battle with the Senate. ""The whole process is silly and everyone knows how it's going to end,"" said Club for Growth's Barney Keller to CNN. The spokesman thinks the House and Senate will combine their bills and pass some form of tax extenders later this year. ""It's ridiculous."" What next? While the vote passed with the overwhelming endorsement of House Republicans -- just two voted 'no' -- this will not be the final version of a tax cut bill. The Senate also must ring in on how deal with the expired tax cuts. And as Keller with the Club for Growth noted, House members openly are positioning for those negotiations with the Senate. That could happen in the last months of the year. ""We'll have a good old-fashioned compromise,"" said Rep. Pat Tiberi, Republican of Ohio and sponsor of Friday's bill.","Boehner says measure meant to help small businesses .
Critics say the measure may not get the desired effect .
Senate must weigh in ."
"(CNN) -- A young man who was 14 when he shot and killed his family on a New Mexico ranch owned by newsman Sam Donaldson has been freed, a spokeswoman for the state's youth and families agency said Saturday. Cody Posey had just finished the eighth grade when he was arrested on July 7, 2004, in connection with the slayings of his father, stepmother and stepsister. He confessed to the slayings, but said he snapped after years of physical and psychological abuse. He said he fatally shot his father, Paul Posey, 34, stepmother, Tryone Posey, 44, and stepsister, Mairlea Schmid, 13, and then used a backhoe to bury their bodies inside a manure pile. Posey was convicted in February 2006 of voluntary manslaughter for his father's death, second degree murder for his stepmother's death and first degree murder for his stepsister's death. The state asked the court to impose the maximum adult sentence, life without parole. But Judge James Waylon Counts ruled that it was possible Posey could be rehabilitated and sentenced him as a juvenile offender. Once he reached 21, he could no longer be held as a juvenile and was free to go. Posey turned 21 on Saturday, according to his uncle, Carl Clees. ""He has a bright future. I see no problems with him progressing and getting on with his life like the rest of us,"" Clees said. Romaine Serna, spokeswoman for New Mexico's Children Youth and Families Department, confirmed Saturday that Posey is a free man. While in custody, Posey obtained his high school degree and completed nearly two years worth of college credits, Clees said, adding that he had no disciplinary issues and served as a mentor to other youths. The Posey family lived and worked on the Chavez Canyon Ranch in Hondo, New Mexico, owned by Donaldson, a former anchor at ABC News. It was Donaldson who discovered the bloody scene inside the Poseys' home on July 6. Donaldson was the first witness to testify at Posey's trial in Children's Court in 2006. Posey's defense called 40 witnesses, including ranch hands who claimed they witnessed years of physical and psychological abuse by Posey's father. Testifying in his defense, Posey described the night before the shootings. His father and stepmother summoned him to the master bedroom and tried to force him to have sex with his stepmother, he testified. When Posey refused, his father burned him with a heated metal rod, he testified. Posey said he ran from the room. He was still reeling from the encounter the next morning when his father slapped him while he was doing chores. He said he decided to grab a gun from Marilea's saddle bag, and then shot each member of his family in the head. ""I was thinking my world would be better and the whole world would be better without him,"" he told police shortly after his arrest. In his confession, Posey admitted that after burying the bodies in the manure pile, he tried to stage the scene to look like a burglary. He said he took the family's pickup and visited friends, where he spent the night, lying about where his family was. Donaldson told jurors he called the police soon after finding a large amount of congealed blood in the house and a ""disturbing, red, dry swath"" across the floor where the bodies had been dragged. The bloody trail and backhoe tracks led police to the manure pile where the badly decomposed bodies were discovered. Although the shootings occurred within seconds of each other, the jury returned different verdicts for each victim, siding in part with Posey's claims of abuse. But now, Posey just wants a fresh start, his uncle said. ""I'm excited for him. I look forward to helping him as much as possible,"" Clees said. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","Cody Posey was 14 when he killed his father, stepmother and stepsister in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- The United States launched a series of airstrikes Wednesday against ISIS forces in Iraq, the same day President Barack Obama vowed to act against the militant group following its beheading of an American journalist and its threat to kill another. ""The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people. We will be vigilant and we will be relentless,"" the President said in televised remarks. Obama vowed justice for James Foley, calling his killing by ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State, an act of violence that ""shocked the conscience of the entire world."" The President's statement followed Tuesday's release by ISIS of a video that showed Foley's killing and carried a stark warning that a second American, believed to be journalist Steven Sotloff, would be killed, if the United States did not end its military operations in Iraq. Whether Sotloff lives or dies, the executioner said on the video, depends on what Obama does next. ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans, including Sotloff, a U.S. official told CNN. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to say exactly how many Americans were being held or to identify them. Also Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a written statement that the United States attempted a rescue operation earlier this summer to free a number of American hostages held in Syria by ISIS. ""Unfortunately, the mission was not successful because the hostages were not present at the targeted location,"" he said. Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that the mission was to rescue Foley and others being held at an undisclosed location. If ISIS, also known as ISIL, hoped the execution video and threat would ease U.S. military involvement in Iraq, it failed. Calling ISIS a ""cancer,"" Obama said across the Middle East there has to be a common effort to put an end to the group. ""Friends and allies around the world, we share a common set of values that are rooted in the opposite of what we saw yesterday,"" he said. ""And we will continue to confront this hateful terrorism and replace it with a sense of hope and civility."" As the President spoke, the Pentagon confirmed the United States carried out 14 airstrikes against mobile ISIS targets in the vicinity of the Mosul Dam, which Kurdish forces recaptured from the terror group with the support of American airpower. Humanitarian operation underway . Obama ordered targeted airstrikes in Iraq this month to protect U.S. personnel and facilities, as well as minorities being brutalized by ISIS. The campaign by ISIS in Iraq began in June when the group swept in from Syria, seizing Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul. ISIS militants, who are Sunni Muslim extremists, have carried out brutal attacks on towns and villages as they've advanced across Iraq, targeting Iraq's Christians, minority sects such as the Yazidis, centered in the northern Sinjar area, and Shia Muslims. The UNHCR estimates that 1.2 million Iraqis have been forced from their homes so far this year, including more than one hal million in the western Anbar province and a similar number in northern Iraq. A plane carrying the first load of humanitarian aid as part of a multiday operation to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people in northern Iraq has landed in Irbil, the U.N. refugee agency said. ""It's the largest single aid push we have mounted in more than a decade,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, said. The first Boeing 747 to land carried 100 tons of aid, he said. Three more flights will follow from Jordan into Irbil, the Kurdish regional capital, with the last on Saturday. The airlift will be bolstered by deliveries made by road and sea over the next 10 days, with 175 trucks ferrying cargo from warehouses in Turkey, Jordan and Iran. The shipments include thousands of tents, plastic sheets, kitchen sets and jerrycans, destined for families who fled with little more than the clothes on their back. What to know about ISIS . More US troops to Iraq? As the massive aid operation swings into gear, fierce fighting continues between the militants and Kurdish forces for control of northern Iraq. On Tuesday, U.S. airstrikes helped Kurdish and Iraqi forces take control of the key Mosul Dam, fighting back the militants who had seized it. The stakes were huge for the millions of Iraqis who live downstream from the dam, the largest in the country, amid fears that if it were breached floods would have threatened lives in Mosul and downriver in Baghdad. Now that the dam is cleared of ISIS militants, Iraqi forces are moving to grow their area of control, the Defense Department said. The Pentagon is considering a State Department request for more U.S. troops to protect U.S. government personnel in the Baghdad area, a U.S. official confirmed to CNN. If approved, the troops would number less than 300, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""There is a request by the State Department for additional security personnel in and around Baghdad,"" the official said. The official would not say where the troops would go, but there are two publicly known locations for American personnel working in Baghdad -- the U.S. Embassy and Baghdad International Airport. The official insisted that there was no specific threat that led to this request, which Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel would have to approve. The troops would be in addition to the hundreds of American military advisers already in the country advising Iraqi troops in their fight against ISIS.

"(CNN) -- If this long-delayed and blatantly pandering CGI malarkey is anything to go by, Hollywood's current craze for fairy tales isn't going to have a happy ending. Originally slated for release last spring, ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" was ostensibly pushed back to take advantage of Jeremy Renner's rising star (he had ""The Bourne Legacy"" and ""Avengers"" coming out in the summer). Renner is entitled to cash in on his ""Hurt Locker"" acclaim and make a living like anybody else, but I'll bet he was more animated cashing his check than he is as a gun-toting medieval witch slayer, the little boy from Grimm's fairytale grown up with a chip on his shoulder and an inexplicable American accent (which is shared by his ""sis,"" Gemma Arterton's leather-clad Gretel, but no one else in this neck of the woods). Hansel is also inflicted with diabetes -- ""sugar sickness"" -- and periodically slumps into a coma until he self-administers an injection through his britches. You'll know how he feels. The idea may be kind of cute -- remember Hansel was force-fed candy as a kid -- but typically half-baked in a flick that throws anachronisms around like they're going out of style. Writer-director Tommy Wirkola, whose first film was the cult Nazi zombie pic ""Dead Snow,"" hasn't concocted more than a slender thread of a narrative. A witch is snatching so many children that the town mayor brings in the sibling celebrity bounty hunters (wait a minute, didn't Terry Gilliam all ready make this movie as ""The Brothers Grimm""?). Rather than construct any scares, suspense or surprise, the movie attempts to stave off boredom with a dose of kung fu fighting every five minutes. The movie hits its nadir early, when Thomas Mann's teenage fanboy, Ben, shows up in a tavern bearing press clippings of the dynamic duo's exploits and asks for their autographs -- slipping in some bonehead exposition for good measure: ""So how do you kill witches?"" It never really improves much either -- except maybe in the gratuitous semi-nudity when a mildly wounded Hansel is coaxed into skinny dipping in ""healing waters"" by a comely maiden who leads by example. Playing the wickedest witch (""Muriel""), whose true features resemble the Bonneville Salt Flats, Famke Janssen signals her wickedness by. Talking. Like. This. Very. Slowly. Which has the unfortunate consequence of underlining the clichÃ©d nature of lines like ""I'm not. Going to. Kill you. Yet. That. Would. Be. Too. Ea. Sy!"" Yes indeed, too easy by far, when Wirkola seems to specialize in the heavy-handed, cumbersome and laborious, even when he's aiming for flip. Especially when he's aiming for flip. It's a tossup what's most depressing, the abject storytelling (and when you find yourself yearning for the storytelling skills of Terry Gilliam, that's not a good sign) or the reprehensible, lazy thinking that equates evil with physical deformity. Look how we're invited to enjoy the slaughter of witches -- including conjoined twins and a ""half lady"" -- and how Wirkola insidiously mixes sideshow freaks with the reactionary connotation of the word: The witches are made up to resemble Goths and punks, outsiders who deserve nothing better than the gory reckoning he contrives for them. As for shooting the thing in 3-D, the movie has some eye-catching effects. It's just a pity Wirkola and company never see the wood for the trees.","The film was pushed back to take advantage of Jeremy Renner's rising star .

"(CNN) -- Seattle is a city of permanent caffeine buzz. As well as being the birthplace of Starbucks, Seattle boasts countless independent coffee houses where the humble cup of Joe is served in all manner of fancy permutations. Fancy an iced maple white-chocolate mocha? Then this is your kind of town. Get your morning fix at the ever-popular Espresso Vivace Roasteria (901 E Denny Way and 227 Yale Ave), or at one of the many branches of local chain Tully's. Restaurant Crush is still talk of the town. After a morning of coffee-fueled sightseeing, carb load at Café Flora (2901 East Madison Street), which boasts a wholesome organic menu that just happens to be vegetarian. The hearty Sunday brunch is especially good. You can always put together your own lunch by picking up some fantastic produce at Pike Place Market, or you can just browse the stalls before filling up on fiery Tex-Mex fare at World Class Chili (93 Pike Street), which is as good as its name claims. It's also a decent choice for spice-loving vegetarians. Dinner in Seattle means picking from a huge selection of quality dining spots. Crush (2319 East Madison Street) is still talk of the town, which means you'll need to book well ahead to be sure of getting a table. The décor is minimal but warm, and the food is a fine example of what is known as Modern Northwest cuisine. Modern Northwest cuisine has Asian and Native American influences and is big on fresh local ingredients -- which means plenty of seafood. Another great place to sample the style is at Canlis (2576 Aurora Avenue North), which overlooks Lake Union and is famed for its extensive wine list. Chef Tom Douglas is reputed to be the originator of Northwest cuisine and his Dahlia Lounge (2001 4th Avenue) is famed for its desserts. Try the doughnuts with vanilla mascarpone, served still warm and utterly delicious. For something more European you should venture to Campagne (86 Pine Street) to dine on robust southern French cuisine while looking out over Pike Place and across Elliot Bay, while Sushi fans will want to grab a seat at Shiro's Sushi Restaurant (2401 2nd Avenue). If you're lucky you'll get to see Kyoto-born chef Shiro Kashiba masterfully preparing fish plucked from the waters of Puget Sound. Maneki (304 6th Avenue South) is another good bet for sushi, and if that doesn't satisfy your seafood cravings, make your way to Elliott's Oyster House on Pier 56. As well as oysters there's local Dungeness crab and wild Northwest salmon, and if the sun is shining the outdoor deck has glorious waterfront views.

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut woman mauled by a friend's chimpanzee in 2009 describes in a new video what it was like waking up in a hospital after the attack. Unaware she had lost her vision, Charla Nash said she asked her brother Mike to turn on the lights. ""He said the lights are on,"" Nash remembers, and ""little by little, it started to come together."" Nash was attacked while trying to help coax her friend's 14-year-old pet chimpanzee back into her house. Travis the chimp, which had appeared in television commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on Nash, biting and mauling her. Police later fatally shot Travis to stop the attack, which left Nash without hands, a nose, lips or eyelids. ""I remember laying in the room, and I remember sometimes I would try to scratch my leg, and then I wasn't feeling it,"" she said. ""It's a different world to not be able to see again or to use your hands and do things for yourself that you have to depend on other people for help now,"" Nash said. The seven-minute video, released to Connecticut state legislators, features an interview with Nash and footage of her walking around the private medical facility where she lives and receives daily assistance for her injuries. Representatives for Nash will present her case to the Connecticut State Judiciary Committee on Friday in hopes that legislators will allow her to proceed with a $150 million lawsuit against the state. By law, anyone seeking to sue the state of Connecticut must seek permission to do so. Since the attack five years ago, Nash has had numerous surgeries, including a face transplant. She sued Sandra Herold, the owner of the chimp, and received $4 million for her injuries, but according to spokesman Shelly Sindland, that settlement doesn't even begin to cover the expenses for her treatment. Part of the $150 million she's seeking would fund a hand transplant, which doctors unsuccessfully attempted at the time of her face transplant. Nash hopes they will be able to try again. ""I want ... to be able to do more on my own,"" Nash said. Nash is still waiting for an opportunity to square off against the state for injuries she contends could've been prevented. Sindland said authorities at the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection ignored a memo sent in October 2008, four months before the attack, from Connecticut state biologist Elaine Hinsch that said Travis the chimp was ""an accident waiting to happen."" The state, Sindland alleges, ""knew that the chimp was a danger"" but didn't do anything to remove it from the home. Dennis Schain, director of communications for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, told CNN he is aware of the memo, but he said all statements from the case must come from the state Attorney General's Office. In a statement to CNN, Connecticut attorney general spokeswoman Jaclyn Falkowski said, ""The legal question in this case is: Did the state owe a legal duty to protect Ms. Nash from attack by a privately owned chimp on private property? Under well-settled law, it did not."" ""While we have the utmost sympathy for Charla Nash, we do not believe that the state is liable for Ms. Nash's injuries. To decide otherwise would set a very dangerous precedent, exposing the state and its taxpayers to unlimited liability and costly litigation."" In June, the Office of the Claims Commissioner denied Nash her request to sue the state for $150 million. Friday's appeal is the last opportunity for her to get permission to move forward with a lawsuit, and even if it makes it through committee, it would then have to be voted through both the state's House and Senate before moving forward. ""I'm hoping the legislation will allow me to have my day in court,"" Nash said. Face transplant patients: Where are they now? CNN's Haimy Assefa contributed to this report.","Charla Nash presents a seven-minute video to Connecticut state legislators .

"(CNN) -- When video of Justin Bieber's deposition surfaced this week and went viral, most of us were amusedâ€”especially lawyers. (You can watch some of it here). As he answers questions for a battery case involving his bodyguard and a photographer, Bieber is glib and tries to parry the deposing attorney's questions. If we could see off camera, we might see Bieber's attorney subtly shaking his head in frustration. Counsel would know what Justin may not want to ""beliebe"": You only hurt yourself at a deposition when you bicker with the questioning attorney. To those luckily unfamiliar with depositions, it may have looked simply like Bieber was being a defiant celebrity in an interview. But a deposition is no interview, and treating it that way is to invite catastrophe. Bieber made a number of missteps typical for beginners. Here's what he should have known: . What is a deposition? Testifying at a deposition looks a little like testifying at a trial. There are lawyers, a stenographer, questions and answers. But a deposition is not a trial. At trial, you can tell your story and convince a jury of your position. A deposition, on the other hand, is the other side's only opportunity to find out what's in your mind, lock your story in writing, and have it ready to bash you over the head with if you testify inconsistently at trial. Generally, the more your opponent gets you to talk at a deposition, the more information he or she has to use against you at trial. An argumentative witness like Bieber is a dream come true for his opponent. Smile, you're on camera: Most depositions are not videotaped. It's expensive and the costs don't always justify the benefits. But Justin Bieber's opponents want him on camera, preferably preening and pugnacious. Watch, for example, when he answers: ""Guess what? Guess what? I don't recall."" Had the deposition only been recorded in a transcript, on paper that looks pretty innocent. But watch the oozing hostility on the video, and his dramatic ""I don't recall"" might play to a jury as ""I am conveniently forgetting negative evidence."" His opponent scored points deposing him on camera. You can't answer if you don't know the question:  Bieber can be seen interrupting questions to answer. A witness should always wait until the question has been completely asked. First, someone is typing the questions and answers into a transcript, and interruptions end up looking like someone spilled Scrabble letters onto a piece of paper: Unintelligible. A witness should only answer the question asked, lest he volunteer information to help the other side. And, if a question hasn't even been finished yet, a witness can't possibly limit the answer to the question asked -- he doesn't know what the question is yet! Best practice? Wait until the question is complete; pause and ask yourself if you understand the question; if you do, ask yourself if you know the answer to the question; if you do, only answer the question asked. Depositions are not soapboxes:  At a deposition, you will never ""show up"" the other side's lawyers. You are not there to show them the error of their ways and win them over. They will not turn to colleagues and announce: ""You know what? After hearing this story, I think we're on the wrong side of justice here. We should pack up and go home. Thanks for your time, Mr. Bieber."" Objection to the objection: Bieber can be heard warning the lawyer not to ask about sensitive subjects, like his possible relationship with other celebrities. Elsewhere, he actually (and hilariously) interposes his own ""objection."" At a deposition, the lawyer asks the questions, not the witness. The witness doesn't decide what's relevant. At a deposition, ""relevant"" subject matter is any question ""reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence."" It doesn't have to be admissible evidence, just calculated to possibly lead to admissible evidence. Therefore, virtually any question is arguably proper. That's why grizzled veterans of ""deps"" routinely acknowledge that, practically, they can feel like a fishing expedition. Bieber may not like the questions, but he takes his chances with the judge if he refuses to answer. Arguing requires additional words:  Don't argue with the lawyer, Justin. The rules of evidence are always skewed in favor of the attorney, and against the witness. Witnesses are often smarter than the lawyer, but the rules simply give the lawyer an overwhelming advantage. Moreover, arguing takes more words than simply answering yes or no. Bieber's opponent benefits from each additional word Bieber says, because that's part of another sentence the singer needs to testify consistently with at trial. We all know it's nearly impossible to tell the same story twice, but a good cross-examiner will make minor inconsistencies from an earlier deposition look like a flawed memory, or worse, paint the witness as a liar. In text form, sarcasm doesn't read like sarcasm:  Sarcasm is using words to indicate (sarcastically) the opposite of what you really want to say. Sarcasm really comes out in the way you say something. Q: Did you shoot the sheriff? A: Oh yeah, sure. I shot the sheriff. See? Without the benefit of the voice and visual elements of sarcasm, on paper someone just admitted to shooting the sheriff, when maybe they wanted to be sarcastic. Devastating. For the most part, you're on your own: Bieber's lawyer actively objected to protect his client, but deponents often feel like their lawyers aren't getting involved enough. For the most part, lawyers cannot. The rules of discovery seriously limit how much Bieber's attorney can object. He can object ""for the record,"" which means the judge can later decide if the answer is ultimately admissible at trial. Of course, some questions are so outside the realm of relevance or civility that the attorney has to intervene. The questions about Bieber's personal relationships could potentially fall into this category, because they appear to stretch the boundaries. It wasn't all terrible: In fairness to Bieber, he did some things right. He made it clear when he did not understand a question. That's critical, because if he answers a question without fully understanding it, the court will later on assume he understood it when he answered it. Bieber appears on the video to really think about the meaning of the questions and his answers. If he could carve out his other behavior, in some respects, he's not half-bad as a deponent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","Danny Cevallos: Justin Bieber is petulant and sarcastic in a videotaped deposition .
Cevallos: Bieber should know this is not an interview: Interruptions just hurt his side .
Cevallos: Depositions are not soapboxes; you aren't there to match wits and bicker .

"(CNN) -- We conquered Greektown last weekend like so many Detroit bachelorette parties before -- cheap champagne, slot machines, grown-woman giggles. We stuck to the city's party-friendly district, home of a casino, restaurants that specialize in flaming cheese and Astoria Pastry Shop, where we spent a long, crave-denying half-hour forcing ourselves not to order one of everything. Some pals and soon-to-be family drove five hours to be there. My clan has long lived nearby, but some guests had never visited the D. I'm sure there was nervous laughter on the way in, recognition of decades of terrifying headlines. Detroit hasn't heard many kind words since the 1960s, and much of what's said is rooted in reality. It's a place with money trouble, population trouble, housing trouble, crime trouble; even the most bright-eyed of the artist-farmer entrepreneurs arriving in the city won't deny it. It was a merry night, but I know some of our guests left exasperated and disappointed by the view from the expressway and the sense that we shouldn't stray too far from the well-lit hotel perimeter. I left feeling guilty, like I'd shirked my duties as an ambassador of the Mitten's greatest city. Detroit has problems, but lack of identity and charisma isn't among them. Its rise and fall resembles the story of other cities, but on the ground, there's nothing like it -- exactly the trait that makes any place worth a visit. I miss it when I'm gone and perpetually wish for a few more days to explore. But without a guide, our visitors couldn't even tell where to start. City smackdown: Philly, a fine place for 'cast-offs, misfits' I know what we should have done. When everybody arrived, we should've had a pile of sunshine-yellow Better Made potato chips, round paczki from New Martha Washington bakery and Faygo Rock & Rye, or maybe Redpop, waiting. We could've table hopped and ordered often: the Vedgie sandwich at Mudgie's, beef cheek pierogie at Roast, barbecue at Slows, beer at Motor City Brewing Works, cheaper beer at the Anchor. We should've poked our heads into each of the 52 rooms at The Whitney and requested the creme brulee, just because. There should've been coneys, those chili-cheese-hot dog monstrosities best consumed on the wrong side of 2 a.m. (Or at lunch, if you're that kind of hungry.) The next morning, we could've gotten coffee and pastries from Avalon International Breads or detoxed in the worth-the-wait crepe line at Good Girls go to Paris. We should've sent everybody home with a box of sugared goodies from La Gloria in Mexicantown. Maybe we should've planned the party a day earlier, so we could hit CafÃ© D'Mongo, the Fridays-only speakeasy. The next day, we could've shopped Eastern Market -- the old R. Hirt Jr. specialty store recently reopened under the name DeVries & Co. It's still owned by a grandson of the founder, still a wise place to buy cheese. We might've taken the Dequindre Cut, a pedestrian-only greenway, straight to the Riverfront. In all that concrete, marble and glass, it's easy to forget it's a city made possible by water. We could've stared south at Canada, or crossed the bridge to Belle Isle, the island playland larger than Central Park, with elements designed by famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and Detroit favorite Albert Kahn. Detroit is, unfortunately, perhaps, the artistic home of ""ruin porn,"" and while Michigan Central Station and the like are worth an ogle, we really should've stopped in the very-much-alive art deco Guardian Building to spin in the lobby. We might've walked up and down the streets of Boston-Edison and Brush Park to appreciate the glorious old houses, or the sidewalks of Lafayette Park to see the more modern Ludwig Mies van der Rohe homes. We should've stayed a day longer and gone to the Detroit Institute of Arts. We could pore over each corner of Diego Rivera's murals and walk among Warhols, Rembrandts and Egyptian mummies. For another view, we'd stop at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Pewabic Pottery and the Motown Museum. Cruising music: Aretha, Gladys, Stevie, repeat. We could've at least driven through the Heidelberg Project, the neighborhood art project by native son Tyree Guyton, helped along by artists such as Tim Burke. We would be smarter to stop and talk to people there; a few years ago, they generously blocked off the street for my wedding and applauded from their porches. I will always believe their neighborhood is a place to celebrate. We'd have to set aside an afternoon for John K. King books, four floors and a basement that smell like your favorite corner of the library and bedtime stories at grandma's. My uncle calls it ""the only used book store where you can go with a list,"" but I've never bothered with one. Like a casual gambler at Detroit's casinos, it's probably better to set a budget and wander. What would we miss when we took a break? Games at Comerica Park, Ford Field or Joe Louis Arena; shows at the Fox Theatre or the acoustically stunning Orchestra Hall; music at the Magic Stick, Chene Park or PJ's Lager House; classic movies (and real, live pipe organ!) at the Redford Theatre? The suburbs would be on the someday list -- the Detroit Zoo and its newly born river otters, the glassblowers and re-enactors at Greenfield Village and Buckminster Fuller's geodesic Dymaxion House at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn. When everybody is back with their kids in tow, maybe we'll make a day of the Cranbrook Institute of Science's planetarium. One night of partying is too short for this place, or any place. I live in Atlanta now, and it too, has a part of my heart. I wouldn't want it, or any of my homes, to be judged on its most dilapidated blocks, its greatest tragedies or the symbolism of its past. No city is so obvious. So I can understand if our guests drove away shaking their heads, but I won't let it happen again. They'll be back in August for my sister's wedding. Detroit will be entering its most beautiful season, when the wind is warmer and the temperatures cooler. We will roll down Woodward Avenue, the grand lane in and out, but we'll stop often to look around, because this is Detroit, and that is Detroit, and this, too.

"(CNN) -- Hello BET. Was it Lionel Richie you were looking for? The 2014 BET Awards aired Sunday, and the show honored the legendary singer with the lifetime achievement award. The only problem was that Richie's last name was spelled ""Ritchie"" in the graphic, prompting the trending of #lionelritchie on Twitter and deliberate misspellings of his name. But that moment was just one of the hits and misses for the night. HIT: Chris Brown's performance . The star, recently released from jail, returned to the stage to perform his song ""Loyal"" with a little help from rappers Lil Wayne and Tyga. His performance energized the crowd -- and also sparked much discussion about his plaid fashion choice. MISS: Beyonce and Jay Z's 'live' performance . Plenty of TV viewers stayed up to catch what they believed would be a live performance by a superstar couple. Instead, the performance turned out to be a prerecorded video of the pair during a stop of their tour in Cincinnati. It was hot, but not live, and Billboard tweeted that ""People are leaving the awards show in droves right now during Jay Z and Beyonce clip #BETAwards."" HIT: Chris Rock's opening monologue . The comic hosted this year's ceremony, and he killed. Rock poked fun at everyone from the performers -- of Chris Brown, he said the singer ""just signed a new deal -- too bad it's a plea deal"" -- to celebs in the audience, and even got topical with the controversy over racial remarks made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. ""What exactly did he say?"" Rock asked. ""What exactly did Donald Sterling say? 'I don't want my woman around black basketball players.' Me neither!"" MISS: Nicki Minaj's acceptance speech . The rapper and former ""American Idol"" judge won the best female hip-hop artist award and gave a speech that left many scratching their heads. After declaring ""I don't look at myself as a female rapper 'cause I know what I do,"" she went on to offer that ""When you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it,"" which some took to be a diss directed at new rapper Iggy Azalea. (Although Minaj quickly added ""No shade,"" meaning she was not directing her remarks at anyone.) Minaj then went on to describe her recent -- sort of -- near brush with death. ""I just want to say that the other day, literally, I didn't tell anybody this, I really thought I was about to die,"" Minaj said. ""Like, I was saying my prayers to die. And I didn't even want to call an ambulance because I thought, 'Well, if I call the ambulance, it's gonna be on TMZ.' And I would rather sit there and die. And it made me realize -- I don't care anymore what anybody gotta say."" It may take us until the 2015 BET Awards to sort that one out.","Richie's name is spelled ""Ritchie"" in graphic .

"(CNN) -- They're late to the party, but the spooks have finally joined Twitter. And -- who knew? -- they have a sense of humor. At 1:49 pm ET on Friday, the Central Intelligence Agency sent its first-ever Twitter message, from a verified account with the simple handle of @CIA. With characteristic secrecy, it said: ""We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet."" The Internet immediately erupted with delight. Within two hours the message had been retweeted more than 85,000 times, the CIA had gained more than 105,000 followers, and the jokes were flowing faster than Claire Danes' tears on ""Homeland."" ""@CIA how does it feel to be followed for once?"" replied one Twitter user. Social media outreach does seem like an odd fit for a shadowy spy agency whose work is mostly classified. But the CIA, which also joined Facebook on Friday, is trying to brighten its public face. ""By expanding to these platforms, CIA will be able to more directly engage with the public and provide information on CIA's mission, history, and other developments,"" said CIA Director John Brennan in a statement. ""We have important insights to share, and we want to make sure that unclassified information about the Agency is more accessible to the American public that we serve, consistent with our national security mission."" The agency also promised to post ""the latest news, statements, and career information"" from the CIA, along with artifacts from the CIA's museum, updates from its World Factbook and unclassified intelligence information. By launching officially on Facebook and Twitter, the CIA is expanding its limited online presence beyond its public website, Flickr and YouTube accounts. Compared to some rival government agencies, though, it's got some catching up to do. The National Security Agency joined Twitter in 2009, the FBI joined in 2008 and those early adopters at the State Department joined in 2007.","The Central Intelligence Agency finally joins Twitter, Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Football can't do much to help the devastated communities along the Jersey Shore after Hurricane Sandy. But this is what residents in dozens of towns are discovering this month: Football players can. From Union Beach to Seaside Heights, from Belmar to Bayville, local high school teams are aiding the recovery effort with supplies, with support, and sometimes, with strength. That was the scene in Point Pleasant Beach last weekend. More than a dozen members of the town's undefeated high school team went door to door helping their neighbors. They carried out flood-ravaged debris to the curb, from couches to dressers to dining room furniture, and when they finished one house they would walk as a group to the next and start again. ""I said to the kids when I texted them (to organize the cleanup), the community has been so behind us, this is an opportunity for us, in a way, to say thank you,"" said John Wagner, the team's head coach. Many of the players had done the same thing at their own homes earlier in the week. Others were displaced, living in hotels or shelters, not sure where their families would settle long-term. This is the case up and down the Jersey Shore, the epicenter of the devastation from the unprecedented storm. The images on television days after, from the roller coaster from the Seaside boardwalk sitting in the ocean to the boats piled up like toys on the streets, do not begin to sum up the damage. It is not just the beachfront mansions that took a beating here. It is the Cape Cods and single-story ranch homes that are blocks away from the ocean that suffered devastating flooding. Families who never experienced so much as a drop of water in their basements for decades were dealing with several feet of it, sometimes enough to make the houses unlivable. Families who only lost possessions consider themselves lucky. Quinn Kusma is a linebacker for the Point Pleasant Beach team who lives five houses from the beach in Lavallette, New Jersey. He left his home as the storm hit and still hasn't returned -- and probably won't for a month. It could be up to a year before his house is livable again, which means as he finishes his senior year, he's essentially homeless. The family is living in a hotel in a neighboring town. ""I figured I'd be safe and bring enough (clothes) for five days,"" Kusma said. ""I was only off by 360."" Still, Kusma was one of the players who helped organize his teammates to help their neighbors. When the cheerleaders heard what the players had in mind, they came to help, too. One woman, who lives a block from the football field, broke into tears when the teenagers started streaming into her house to clean up. ""The wins come and go, but what you did for people, that's the stuff you don't forget,"" Wagner said. ""That's more important."" How you can help Sandy victims . The efforts were not isolated to Point Pleasant Beach. In nearby Manasquan, which was hit hard with flooding, dozens of players met at a local church to unload three truckloads of supplies. Then they shoveled sand that had washed up onto the streets into trash cans that they dragged back up to the beach. On it goes, with teams everywhere trying to help. A basketball team in Linden, New Jersey, far from the hardest-hit areas, organized a clothes and canned goods drive at halftime of its football game. Two bitter rivals, St. John Vianney and Raritan High, were schedule to play last Friday; instead, the players came together and collected donations at a shopping plaza. ""Football and sports have been secondary right now,"" said Mark Ardizzone, who had trouble tracking down his players in Asbury Park because of spotty phone service. ""It's all about helping each other out and helping the community out."" The help extends beyond the high school level, too. Rutgers, the state university in New Jersey, and its athletic teams have gotten involved, planning to sell T-shirts with the state's outline and the word ""strong"" at its game against Army this weekend to benefit the Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund. Several athletes and athletic department officials also went to hard-hit Union Beach to unload supplies. Tim Pernetti, the athletic director, saw a town where houses were literally torn in half during the storm. ""People down here are hurting,"" he said. ""This is not just Rutgers people who need to help. The whole state of New Jersey needs to help."" Professional teams have also contributed, from the $500,000 gifts from the Giants and the Yankees to the personal visit to Toms River, another coastal town, from Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez. Eli Manning, the Giants quarterback who had flooding in his own Hoboken, New Jersey, apartment, helped unload supplies in Staten Island. Games will resume this weekend in some New Jersey towns. In other places, power still hasn't returned to schools, leaving some coaches wondering when -- if ever -- their seasons might continue. But everyone recognizes this: What happens on the field is secondary. What happens off it, from the teenagers carrying seawater-drenched sofas to the curb to the professional teams writing checks, is already making an impact.","New Jersey high school football teams are helping Hurricane Sandy relief efforts .

"TUNIS, Tunisia (CNN) -- Polls closed late Sunday in Tunisia, the torchbearer of the so-called Arab Spring, but voters will not see results of national elections until Tuesday, officials said. On Sunday, long lines of voters snaked around schools-turned-polling-stations in Tunis's upscale Menzah neighborhood, some waiting for hours to cast a vote in the nation's first national elections since the country's independence in 1956. ""It's a wonderful day. It's the first time we can choose our own representatives,"" said Walid Marrakchi, a civil engineer who waited more than two hours, and who brought along his 3-year-old son Ahmed so he could ""get used to freedom and democracy."" Tunisia's election is the first since a popular uprising in January overthrew long-time dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and triggered a wave of revolutions -- referred to as the Arab Spring -- across the region. More than 60 political parties and thousands of independent candidates competed for 218 seats in a new Constitutional Assembly, which will be charged with writing a new constitution and laying the framework for a government system. Voters appeared jubilant on Sunday, taking photos of each other outside polling stations, some holding Tunisian flags. ""It's a holiday,"" said housewife Maha Haubi, who had just taken her position at the end of the long line of more than 1,000 voters waiting outside an elementary school in Menzah. ""Before we never even had the right to say 'yes' or 'no.'"" Nearby, banker Aid Naghmaichi said she didn't mind the long wait to vote. ""We have waited years for this,"" Naghmaichi said. Ali Bergaoui burst out of a classroom waving a Tunisian flag and smiling broadly moments after he voted. He said he and his wife, Miriam, had a sleepless night in anticipation of the vote. They showed up at 7 a.m. when polls officially opened and waited for three hours. ""We waited 50 years for this,"" a triumphant Bergaoui said. Miriam Bergaoui's eyes filled with tears as she tried to express the emotion of the moment. But partisan politics were already on display here. The Bergaouis both said they came in part to vote against Ennahada, the once-banned moderate Islamist party that consistently scored highest in public opinion polls in the weeks leading up to the election. The campaign period marked an escalation in tension between secular and religious Tunisians. Religious groups staged angry protests that sometimes turned violent at universities and a private TV channel, to show opposition to the broadcast of the animated film ""Persepolis,"" which included a depiction of god. Meanwhile, prominent secular politicians, like the Progressive Democratic Party's Ahmed Nejib Chebbi campaigned on anti-Ennahada platforms, warning voters that a victory for the party would mark a setback for Tunisia's development as a secular state. Tunisia's election -- nearly 9 months since the overthrow of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali -- has been praised by U.S. President Barack Obama. ""Today, less than a year after they inspired the world, the Tunisian people took an important step forward,"" Obama said Sunday. In December, a wave of protests began in Tunisia that led eventually to the ousting of President Ben Ali and his prime minister. Tunisia's dramatic protests were triggered by a street vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi who set himself on fire to protest government harassment. Bouzazi, who died at the age of 26, became a symbol for the frustrations of the Arab people, with those frustrations erupting in waves of demonstrations and protests across the region.","""We waited 50 years for this,"" a voter says .

"(CNN) -- A 6-year-old central Florida boy drowned in a pool on a Carnival Cruise ship over the weekend after hasty efforts to resuscitate him failed, the cruise line said Monday. The boy, of Winter Garden just outside of Orlando, was spotted underwater in a mid-ship pool by passengers Sunday, according to a police report and one witness account. It occurred when the ship, the Carnival Victory, was returning from its last leg of a four-day Caribbean cruise. Passenger Deshaun Christian, 23, who witnessed the rescue, told CNN iReport that the incident caught people, enjoying music and dancing, off-guard. Boy pulled from Disney resort pool dies . Christian said a DJ discovered the boy struggling in the water and immediately stopped the music. A guest then jumped into the pool with his clothes on and pulled the boy out, followed by a crew member who unsuccessfully tried to revive the boy, Christian said. The boy was pronounced dead shortly after. ""It was a lot of chaos, people were going crazy, people were praying, they had their hands to the sky. It was a scary scene, seeing a little boy just lifeless,"" Christian said. The Miami-Dade Police Department said it is still investigating the drowning, which appeared to be accidental. A police statement said the boy was in the pool with his 10-year-old brother when he was found submerged. Why drowning doesn't look like it does on TV . ""There were a lot of adults, but why wasn't anyone watching the kids?"" asked Christian, who was traveling with his family. ""You'd think Carnival would have lifeguards around the pool."" In an e-mail to CNN, Carnival Cruise spokeswoman Joyce Oliva said the company does not have lifeguards on duty at its pools, and parental supervision is required for children under 13. The ship left the Port of Miami Thursday and returned on Monday. The latest incident may revive discussions about water safety for pre-teens and adolescents. See photo of the aftermath . In March, a 13-year-old Missouri boy died two days after he was pulled from the bottom of a swimming pool at a Disney resort in Florida. No lifeguards were on duty at the time; signs warning that swimmers swam at their own risk were posted. Ten people die every day from unintentional drowning in the United States, making it the fifth-leading cause of unintentional injury death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 20% are under the age of 14. Nearly 80% are male, the CDC says. Carnival Cruise Lines tackles its image .","A Florida boy drowns in a cruise ship swimming pool, Carnival, police say .

"(CNN) -- Poet, dramatist and novelist, Wole Soyinka's work has left a large imprint on the literary landscape of Africa. Poltical activist and Nobel Laureat, Wole Soyinka. His work has been performed internationally and in 1986 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Regardless of the global profile and recognition, writing for Soyinka has always been, and always will be, a part of his life. ""I began writing early, very, very early. ... I was already writing short stories for the radio, and selling poems to poetry and art festivals, I was involved in school plays, I wrote essays, so there was no definite moment when I said, now I'm a writer. I've always been a writer,"" he told CNN. Before being honored with a Nobel Prize, Soyinka had written plays performed across the world, set up drama groups and held academic positions in the UK, the U.S. and Nigeria. Poetry and novels make up the rest of his work, but it is with the medium of drama that he feels most comfortable. ""When I write plays, I'm already seeing the shapes on stage, of the actors and their interaction, and so on and so forth. I don't think I've ever written one play as an abstract piece, as a literary piece, floating in the air somewhere, to be flushed out later on,"" he said. Now 75, Soyinka claims it is a natural curiosity with life and humanity that has always compelled him to write, and should be a pre-requisite for all aspiring writers. ""Before you're a writer, you're a citizen, a human being, and therefore the weapons of the citizen are at your disposal to use, or not use,"" he said. Often he's used those ""weapons"" to take aim at oppression, corruption, the legacy of colonialism and slavery, both in his work and more overtly in his political activism. At times he's suffered for his outspoken views; in 1967 he was imprisoned for 22 months for publicly calling for a truce during Nigeria's civil war and in 1994 was forced to leave the country when General Sani Abacha came to power. ""One of my earliest short stories in fact had to do with the story of a family which escaped enslavement by Portuguese slave leaders, so you can see how early I was preoccupied by that theme of power and freedom, and domination,"" he said. ""If there's one overriding political theme it's my continuing emphasis on the axis of freedom and power. I think that the history of the world, of all societies, has spun on those two axes."" Soyinka spends his time between Nigeria, Europe and the U.S., much of it on the lecture circuit, but the need to write remains. ""I've always written plays for the purpose of getting something out of my system. That's the first stage. And the next stage is, I want to get it onto the platform -- onto the stage. And once I've done that, no matter where, I'm satisfied.""

"(CNN) -- ""The Fourth Kind"" isn't the kind that Nome, Alaska, wants around. The horror movie tries to say that documented disappearances of Nome residents are the result of alien abductions and that's just Hollywood hooey, said Mayor Denise Michels. ""People need to realize that this is a science fiction thriller,"" Michels said. She said town residents have been getting a lot of phone calls lately, and frankly, they're a bit tired of talking about it. ""Some of the calls I'm just ignoring,"" Michels said, ""because the issue we had to deal with in real life was very sensitive. The movie is portraying something like the 'Blair Witch Project,' and we're just hoping the message gets out that this is supposed to be for entertainment."" In real life, there was a string of disappearances in the small town on the west coast of Alaska, not far from the Bering Strait. In 2005, the FBI was brought in to investigate. The victims were largely native men traveling to the town from smaller villages, according to the Anchorage Daily News. The FBI looked into about 20 cases, finding alcohol and frigid temperatures to be causes. Nine bodies were never found. ""The Fourth Kind,"" which comes out Friday, uses the disappearances as a jumping-off point for an alien abduction yarn, using ""archived footage"" to create an atmosphere of documentary realism. It's not a new idea; ""The Blair Witch Project"" pulled off the concept effectively, and the recent ""Paranormal Activity"" uses handheld cameras for a cinema verite look. But unlike ""Paranormal,"" ""The Fourth Kind"" literally announces its validity, taking Nome's documented unexplained disappearances and making the case for alien abductions. The film does rely very heavily on the tagline ""What do you believe?"" letting viewers decide for themselves what's real and what's Hollywood, but it also conflates the two for its convenience. For example, the title itself is derived from a ""scale of measurement"" that was ""developed in 1972"" to categorize alien encounters, best known through its use in Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" (On the scale, the first kind of encounter is defined as a UFO sighting; the second, collected evidence of extraterrestrials; and the third kind is contact.) However, Paul Halpern, a physics professor at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who has studied the possibility of extraterrestrial life, doubts its validity. ""Honestly, I've only ever heard of it through fiction,"" he said, ""not as an actual scientific scale of measurement."" The ""fourth kind"" is alien abduction, the hardest encounter to prove until now, said NBC Universal, parent company of distributor Universal Studios, in a press release. First time writer/director Olatunde Osunsanmi was unavailable for comment, but according to a fact sheet handed out at screenings, he discovered the disappearances that plagued Nome in 2004 when a friend told him of a Dr. Abigail Tyler. During sleep studies ""in fall 2000, the therapist's patients, under hypnosis, exhibited behaviors that suggested encounters with nonhumans,"" the statement read. According to the press material, Tyler recorded footage depicting disturbing scenes, which director Osunsanmi uses alongside re-enactments starring Milla Jovovich and Will Patton in a split screen. To further push the reality bit, Jovovich informs the audience right up front that she ""plays the role of Dr. Abigail Tyler,"" and that the images they are about to see are very disturbing. ""I think that it's fun to have fictional movies about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, but it's important for the public to understand the difference between science and science fiction,"" Halpern said. ""Almost all scientists I know believe that there's no evidence of encounters between humans and alien life forms. Right now, astronomers are [still] trying to find evidence of very simple life forms in space."" Film reviewer Todd Gilchrist said he tried to watch the movie with an open mind. ""I was receptive to the possibility that it could be real, [and] I think that it was convincing enough to make it kind of scary-fun,"" the Cinematical.com reviewer said. ""Within five minutes of walking out of the movie and talking with my girlfriend and somebody else, the whole movie sort of logically falls apart in terms of authenticity,"" he said. But, Gilchrist added, ""it's not deceptive; it's what their marketing campaign is."" But why market fiction as truth in the first place? Found footage and documentary-esque filmmaking changes the atmosphere of a film, Gilchrist said. Instead of walking into a trap a la ""Saw,"" viewers get a ""really creepy atmosphere even when nothing is going on."" Recently, the latter has been more successful than the former, with ""Paranormal Activity"" topping the latest ""Saw"" at the box office. ""People want to see themselves as specifically connected or reflected in entertainment,"" he said. ""Something like 'Paranormal Activity' or 'The Fourth Kind' sort of accesses that desire to be recognized or famous."" For example, by casting Jovovich the movie deliberately pretties up Tyler, which makes the found footage seem all the more true, Gilchrist said. ""The most authentic thing in the movie is how the real woman is much less attractive than Milla Jovovich, which automatically gives that woman's case some authenticity,"" Gilchrist said. ""She's accessible in a normal, human way."" But whether it's real or not, is it scary? It all depends on what you believe, said film reviewer Brad Brevet. ""The audience has to ask themselves, 'Am I going to believe everything is real because Milla Jovovich told me it is?' Your answer to that question decides how effective the rest of the film is going to be,"" he said. ""I was skeptical from the start but [also] questioning, which is one of the reasons I got a few chills."" In Nome, however, Michels wishes people would get a better grip on the difference between fiction and reality, not to mention geography. ""We watched the trailer on the Internet, and the first scenes are these majestic mountains with these trees, which is totally not Nome,"" she said, laughing. ""We're pretty flat, right by the ocean."" According to IMDb.com, ""The Fourth Kind"" was filmed in Bulgaria. ""What they should've done,"" Michels said, still laughing, ""is premiered here at the local theater.""","""The Fourth Kind"" is another horror film relying on the ""found footage"" technique .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- This is not your grandfather's -- or even your father's -- ol' football museum. The new College Football Hall of Fame, opening here Saturday, is a gleaming, high-tech shrine to the pageantry of America's most popular campus sport. Gone, mostly, are the plaques and musty displays of faded uniforms and leather helmets. In their place are vast multimedia touchscreens, movies in 4K ultra-HD, fight-song karaoke and a booth that puts fans into a simulated broadcast of ESPN's ""College Game Day."" And that's not counting the indoor 45-yard replica field where fans can toss a football, run an obstacle course or kick an extra point. ""This is a great space. And it says wonderful things about our sport,"" said Steve Hatchell, president of the National Football Foundation, which oversees the hall. ""It's not just a new building. This facility provides us a national platform for highlighting the heroes of the game and telling their stories."" Top 25 amusement parks around the world . The $68.5 million building starts a new chapter for the Hall of Fame, which had operated for 17 years in South Bend, Indiana, before relocating to Atlanta. South Bend was chosen for its star attraction, the University of Notre Dame, whose Fighting Irish have a national following and 44 Hall of Fame inductees, more than any other school. But attendance in South Bend had slumped to fewer than 70,000 visitors a year, and officials felt that a change was needed. Enter Atlanta, which has a metro-area population of more than 5 million, a thriving convention business and a prime location in the football-mad Southeast, home to the powerhouse Southeastern Conference and the past eight BCS national champions. ""What better place for this ... than Atlanta? We are in the heart of football country,"" Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said at the hall's media event Wednesday. He said the new Hall of Fame, bankrolled by Chick-fil-A, Southwest Airlines and other corporate sponsors, is expected to attract 500,000 annual visitors and an estimated $12 million in ancillary revenue to the state. The 94,000-square-foot football shrine sits around the corner from Atlanta's massive convention center and joins a downtown cluster of tourist attractions, including the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coca-Cola, the CNN Center and the National Center for Civil and Human Rights. It's also a short walk from the Georgia Dome, where the 2014 college football season kicks off with two games next week. Top 20 museums around the world . Visitors are greeted in the lobby by a three-story wall adorned with the helmets of all 768 four-year colleges in the U.S. that field a football team, from mighty Alabama to the tiniest Division III school. To personalize the experience, each visitor gets a badge that can be coded with their favorite college; as they move through the hall, exhibits will read their badge and display information relevant to that team. ""The building recognizes you and starts talking to you,"" said Kevin Gordon, principal of tvsdesign, the hall's architect. ""We want to make sure someone coming in from Idaho or Wisconsin or Oregon feels a connection to the building."" The hall's first floor is designed to help fans imagine the game-day experience from a player's perspective. Visitors pass through a replica of a stadium tunnel and out onto a truncated football field complete with lined turf and regulation-size goal posts. Inside the tunnel are replicas of iconic stadium items, such as Nebraska's horseshoe and Notre Dame's ""Play Like a Champion Today"" sign, that players traditionally touch for luck on their way to the field. Once on the turf, visitors can take part in a skills challenge -- likely to be popular with young fans -- that includes kicking a football through the uprights or dashing through an obstacle course to score a touchdown. Said Brad Olecki, the hall's chief revenue officer, ""this is the best place to bring your kids to tire them out."" 8 weird houses worth a visit . On the second floor, fans will encounter a 52-foot-wide multimedia wall containing 10,000 pieces of content about famous games and players throughout college football's history. Touch a panel and it expands to show photos, sound and video clips. Nearby is a 150-seat theater with continuous showings of ""The Game of Your Life,"" a 10-minute movie that splices together audio from famed players and coaches with ultra-high-definition game footage. Down the hall are exhibits on tailgating, mascot uniforms such as the sweater worn by Uga, the University of Georgia bulldog, and famous quotes by legendary coaches (""The man who tried his best and failed is superior to the man who never tried,"" from Oklahoma's Bud Wilkinson). There's also a booth where would-be radio announcers can test their skill at narrating famous plays, such as Auburn's dramatic touchdown on a missed field goal last year to beat Alabama. On the third floor is the actual Hall of Fame itself, a round room with searchable multimedia screens displaying information on the hall's 1,139 inductees. To be eligible, a player must have been a first-team All-American and be 10 years removed from his final college game, so you'll find USC's Marcus Allen and Navy's Roger Staubach but not Florida's Tim Tebow or Auburn's Cam Newton (at least not yet). 10 spectacular waterfalls across the United States . The Hall of Fame's honorees are an exclusive group. Of the estimated 5 million young men who have played college football since the first-ever game between Princeton and Rutgers universities in 1869, fewer than .0002% are in the hall.

"(CNN) -- When Chokonjetsa was born, he weighed just over 2 pounds. His tiny, underdeveloped lungs struggled for each breath. Then doctors in the hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, put Chokonjetsa on a breathing machine made out of aquarium pumps. Chokonjetsa is one of dozens of newborns in the African country who have survived thanks to the ingenuity of students in a senior design class at Rice University in Houston. The overall survival rate of babies with respiratory distress at the Malawi hospital increased from 44% to 71% with the use of the students' breathing machine, according to a recent clinical trial. Using aquarium pumps, the students have designed a low-cost version of a breathing device called a bubble CPAP, or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, machine. Traditional bubble CPAP systems used in developed countries can cost upwards of $6,000; the students' machine can be manufactured for around $350, providing big savings for hospitals in poverty-stricken areas. Malawi has the highest rate of preterm birth in the world, 18.1 per 100 live births, according to the World Health Organization. Babies born too early often have underdeveloped lungs that don't inflate easily. Premature babies struggle to breathe in part because they don't produce enough lung surfactant, a naturally-produced chemical that keeps the tiny air sacs in the lungs, called alveoli, from collapsing. A lot of these babies die because of the stress struggling to breathe puts on their bodies. Second baby possibly 'cured' of HIV . In Malawi, when a newborn is suffering from respiratory distress, he or she is typically provided extra oxygen via tubes placed gently in the nose. But doctors don't add air pressure to help inflate the infant's lungs. This is the way respiratory distress was treated in newborns, even in developed countries like the United States, until the 1970s. With a CPAP machine, gentle air pressure is pushed via tubes into the nostrils and/or mouth to help facilitate breathing. To understand how a bubble CPAP works, think of a straw that is partially submerged in a glass of water. When you blow into the top of the straw, bubbles come out of the bottom of the straw and bubble up. ""When lungs are underdeveloped, it's like when you're blowing up a completely deflated balloon and that first breath to inflate the balloon is really difficult,"" said Dr. Rebecca Richards-Kortum of Rice University, who helped facilitate the design of the students' bubble CPAP machine. ""For a baby with underdeveloped lungs, every breath is like that."" Doctors and nurses know that it takes very little air pressure to assist newborns. The design students found that two aquarium pumps provided the perfect amount of gentle pressure for delicate lungs. In the original prototype, the machine was housed in a clear plastic shoebox from Target. The device's latest casing box is made from bent sheet metal specifically designed for usability, funcation and durability, said Dr. Maria Oden of Rice University, a co-author of the device's clinical trial along with Richards-Kortum. ""Having used bubble CPAP myself, the (low-cost aquarium pump) machine uses the same general principles,"" said Dr. Andrea Trembath, a neonatal specialist at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland who was not associated with the device's design. ""We've found bubble CPAP to be very beneficial in infants with respiratory distress. ... After taking a look at the photos, the low-cost machine doesn't seem to be very different."" Jocelyn Brown, a former student who helped design the low-cost bubble CPAP machine, has lived in Malawi for almost two years. She is collaborating with aid organizations and using a transitions grant from USAID in hopes of rolling out the device across the country -- first in government hospitals, and then in private and rural hospitals. So far, the machines have been implemented in nine government hospitals, she said. Mysterious cluster of birth defects stumps doctors . Brown said one major challenge to the rollout in Malawi is a lack of nurses and physicians; the high turnover rate makes training difficult. ""Many district hospitals have maybe one doctor, who may not even be a neonatal specialist,"" Brown said. ""Much of the care is provided by nurses, but one nurse could be taking care of 40 patients at a time."" Another challenge, Brown explained, is that parents in Malawi are sometimes reluctant to allow the bubble CPAP machine to be used, perhaps because nasal tubes and masks used in respiratory therapy are associated with death -- usually, only extremely ill patients receive breathing assistance. Fortunately, baby Chokonjetsa's family allowed him to receive the respiratory therapy. His name, which means ""thrown away"" in Malawi's Chichewa language, was chosen by his grandmother. She feared he had been thrown away by God, as she didn't expect him to survive. But with the help of a breathing machine made of aquarium pumps, Chokonjetsa is now a healthy, thriving 7-month-old baby.","College students create a breathing machine from aquarium pumps .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Paul Ryan is trying to talk about the issue of poverty, but the talk so far has produced more problems than solutions. Trying to address the latest political snafu, the Wisconsin Republican said he was ""inarticulate"" when he talked on a conservative radio program Wednesday about a ""tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work."" Ryan, the head of the House Budget Committee and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, has begun to examine the issue of poverty over the past 18 months. He made the statements on Bill Bennett's ""Morning in America"" radio program. California Rep. Barbara Lee called his statement ""deeply offensive"" and a ""thinly veiled racial attack"" and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's press office called it ""shameful."" But are Democrats Lee and Pelosi engaging in political double standards? The scarlet 'R' Andra Gillespie, political science professor at Emory University, said personal bias and perspective dictate their response. ""Rightly or wrongly, when Republicans make comments about structural issues, that's going to be perceived by some as paternalistic,"" she said. Bob Woodson, who has known Ryan for years and heads the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, an organization that works with people on the outskirts of society, said people ""should earn a right to be critical"" by either living in or working with impoverished communities. Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights . While Woodson admires Ryan's interest in poverty and his willingness to travel to some of the most difficult neighborhoods with him and his organization, he said the lawmaker hasn't yet earned the right to be critical ""at this point."" What about President Barack Obama, who has made similar statements about the structural problems of race and poverty? Obama's advantage . At the launch of the new program ""My Brother's Keeper,"" tailored to help African-American and Latino youth succeed, Obama reeled off statistics that show minorities are more likely to be arrested and suspended from school and less likely to graduate. ""And the worst part is, we've become numb to these statistics,"" Obama said last month, adding that people should not make excuses. In addition to My Brother's Keeper, Attorney General Eric Holder has made recent announcements that attempt to change the structural disadvantages facing people of color, including his support of a plan that would reduce prison sentences for some drug offenses. But it's what a politician says and how he says it that matters. ""It's going to be received differently from a black Democrat than from a white Republican,"" Gillespie said. But criticism isn't reserved only for white Republicans. Obama not immune . Since Obama, a black man who grew up without a father and worked in inner city Chicago, entered the national political scene, he has also been criticized for his rhetoric toward the black community. He was criticized by some for being patronizing after his commencement speech at Morehouse College last year, where he advised students to help a fellow young black man and be a good father and spouse. And after his Father's Day address in 2008, where he told black men to be involved in their children's lives, Rev. Jesse Jackson was caught off camera saying Obama talks ""down to black folks."" John Edwards says Dems should do more on poverty . Ryan's second strike . Ryan's comments, however, were doubly troubling to some because he referenced one of the most offensive authors on the issue of race and class. ""You're buddy Charles Murray or Bob Putnam over at Harvard -- those guys have written books on this, which is -- we have got this tailspin of culture,"" Ryan said to Bennett. Murray, a self-described ""right-wing ideologue,"" is the author of the book, ""The Bell Curve,"" which hypothesizes that African-Americans social and economic disadvantages are because they are less intelligent than whites. Gillespie said that if a politician is going to talk about race and poverty and wants to be taken serious, ""Don't invoke the man that wrote 'The Bell Curve.'"" Woodson, who worked at the conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute with Murray when ""The Bell Curve"" was released in 1994, agreed, saying he constantly tells Ryan to stop quoting conservative scholars because their polarizing rhetoric ""seeps into his speeches."" ""All of these guys ... do not talk to the people they write about,"" Woodson said. ""The only thing they are passionate about is the failures of the poor."" Ryan's recent interest in poverty is likely to culminate in policy proposals that are, based on his recent speeches, going to advocate fewer government-centered poverty programs. In a statement Thursday, one day after his controversial remarks, Ryan said he was trying to make a larger point: That ""we cannot settle for this status quo and that government and families have to do more and rethink our approach to fighting poverty."" This flare-up comes less than two weeks after he released a report analyzing 92 federal anti-poverty programs, concluding that are a confusing patchwork of often ineffective prescriptions to combating the problem. Woodson says Ryan's remarks damage his attempt to be authoritative on anti-poverty legislation and issues. It's only ""a minor setback,"" he added. Instead, Woodson advised that Ryan needs to talk about the people he has met in the communities he has visited. Ryan did a version of that last week at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference where he told a story about a child who wanted to bring a brown bag lunch to school instead of receiving free lunch because it showed that someone cared. But that story was not true and he was forced to issue a correction.","Rep. Paul Ryan has responded to criticism about comments over inner city ""culture""

"(CNN) -- Sure, first class sounds swank, but when you're paying a premium of several thousand dollars a ticket, it can be hard to justify the added expense. In an effort to really make it ""worth it,"" airlines have started offering passengers everything from on-board apartments (yes, really) to post-boarding limo rentals and private jet access. We've broken down the top first-class perks to see which carriers offer the best value. Etihad . Come December, the Abu Dhabi-based airline is taking luxury a step further with the launch of Residence Class on its Airbus A380 and Boeing B787 Dreamliner aircraft. Lie-flat seats? So passe. Wealthy customers can enjoy three-room apartments while in the air. These suites -- clocking in at around $40,000 for a round-trip flight from Abu Dhabi to London -- will feature a private bedroom, a living room and en suite shower. Passengers looking for a slightly scaled down experience can book a First Apartment -- a private suite with a full-length bed, separate reclining ottoman and access to a bathroom with shower. All suites will come with a private minibar. What really sells ""The Residence"" is the service. Passengers will get their own Savoy Academy-trained butler, concierge, a chauffeur to get them to and from the airport and a private chef. While guests can order off the a la carte menu, they can also request personalized dishes anytime. Emirates . Emirates has announced similar plans to launch a private, on-board residence, though the details have yet to be released. Still, the Dubai airline has long been at the forefront of in-flight luxury. In 2008, Emirates was the first carrier to install first-class cabins with sliding doors for privacy on their Airbus A380s, A340-500s and on most Boeing 777s. Cabins come with a personal minibar, adjustable lighting, private vanity table, mirror and wardrobe. Guests can avail themselves of a 25-minute ""shower spa"" treatment (though actual shower time is limited to five minutes). There's also turndown service, where cabin crew convert the seat into a bed with a real mattress. And of course there's the award-winning food. In first class, Emirates focuses on regional menus. Passengers can expect items like Iranian caviar or stir-fried lobster in black bean sauce. Air France . Passengers craving an extra level of comfort can book Air France's new La Premiere cabin. These mini-suites -- available on the carrier's long-haul Boeing 777-300 aircraft -- feature lie-flat seats that adapt to each passenger's morphology, a 24-inch HD screen (one of the largest available on board), a private wardrobe and an adjustable privacy curtain. There's a reclining ottoman, so guests from other parts of the cabin can visit. Come nighttime, cabin crew will outfit the seat with a mattress and linens from the Sofitel range. Air France has also teamed with an army of Michelin-rated chefs to design its new La Premiere menu. It features gourmet touches from JoÃ«l Robuchon, RÃ©gis Marcon, Guy Martin, Anne-Sophie Pic and Michel Roth. Qantas . Qantas offers the ubiquitous lie-flat seats, though when it comes time to snooze, cabin crew will set it up as a bed with a sheepskin mattress. The seats also have a range of massage features. The first class ""pods"" are also roomy, taking up the space of about four economy seats. There are also privacy screens to give passengers that much-needed feeling of seclusion. The real draw, however, is the food. In a bid to make in-flight dining restaurant grade, Qantas has teamed with Australian chef and TV personality Neil Perry to design the menu. Diners can go a la carte or enjoy an eight-course tasting menu. Sommeliers are on hand to recommend wine and champagne pairings. Lufthansa . Lufthansa's first-class cabins are fairly standard. They come equipped with lie-flat seats and an amenity-filled washroom. One of the main perks, however, is access to the Lufthansa private jet. Granted, the extra service isn't included, but for travelers wishing to hit up a second -- perhaps more remote -- location, the jet offers a seamless means of transport, minus the rigmarole of layovers. Lufthansa also tapped a few Michelin-starred chefs to design its in-flight menus, complete with caviar service. The award-winning wine program (Vinothek Discoveries) offers a rotation of vintages handpicked by sommelier world champion Markus Del Monego. Singapore Airlines . In 2012, Singapore launched suites aboard its new A380 aircraft. Each cabin features sliding doors and window blinds for maximum privacy. Eschewing the lie-back seat, the carrier opted instead for a standalone bed that can accommodate two people. The cabins also come with a 23-inch screen and USB and HDMI ports, enabling travelers to plug in their own devices. Singapore's Book the Cook service lets passengers pre-order one of more than 60 dishes. Some of its more off-the-cuff items include kyo-kaiseki -- a traditional, bespoke Japanese tasting menu, and wagyu sirloin. Singapore also offers an extensive selection of champagne, grand cru red burgundy and second growth Bordeaux. Cathay Pacific . Last year, Cathay Pacific brushed up its first-class cabins with the help of British architecture firm Foster + Partners. The airline also sought the input of frequent fliers. The results include more spacious personal closets, a thicker mattress and an LCD touchscreen controller that makes it easy to adjust the seat and control the lighting. Passengers are also given BOSE headphones to better enjoy the in-flight entertainment. The bedding has also been improved and passengers are given pajamas from Hong Kong label PYE. The Hong Kong carrier also recently partnered with the Mandarin Oriental Hotel to bring five-star dining to the air. First-class passengers traveling from Hong Kong to London, for example, will be plied with the likes of foie gras, truffles and chicken and beef accompanied by crab meat and caviar. JAL . Japan Airlines has introduced a number of minimalist, first class suites on a handful of routes. These cubicles feature wood grain interiors and air-weave pillows that act as a mattress when the seat is in lie-flat mode -- that's soft on one side and hard on the other, thereby accommodating a number of sleeping preferences. JAL refers to its first-class culinary offerings as a ""restaurant in the sky."" To drive home the metaphor, the airline has partnered with Michelin-starred Japanese chef Seiji Yamamoto. While there's a large selection of Western meals, the Japanese fare is what stands out. Even the rice -- provided by brand Minami-Uonuma and grown in the mountains -- is high end. JetBlue . Somewhat surprisingly for what was once a low-cost carrier, JetBlue recently introduced JetBlue Mint -- a premium class that offers the only private suites with closing doors in the U.S. market. Though the luxury experience is scaled back compared to many other major carriers, so too is the price (one-way tickets from New York to Los Angeles, for example, clock in at a relatively modest $599). When fully flat, the seats, at six feet, eight inches, are the longest in the U.S. market and have a massage function. Passengers can adjust the seat firmness at the touch of a button. The food in Mint is also upscale. JetBlue partnered with New York restaurant Saxon+Parole to introduce a choice of swank tapas, such as Portobello mousse with truffles. Daisy Carrington is a freelance journalist based in London.","Passengers in Etihad's Residence Class have a butler, concierge, chauffeur and chef .

"Lilongwe, Malawi (CNN) -- Despite a majestic lake stretching through its eastern border that gives way to beautiful beaches, Malawi is the African country less-traveled. But it's the place to be if you want to enjoy a natural paradise without everybody else. Though it hasn't become a booming destination like Tanzania, Kenya or South Africa, Malawi has numerous attractions. Named one of the top 10 places to go in 2014 by Lonely Planet, Malawi is one of the lesser known destinations on the travel guide's annual list, which includes Brazil, Sweden and the Seychelles. The country is touted for its wildlife and beaches. But there's more to Malawi than animal parks, warm sands and Madonna's adoptions. 1. The locals are friendly . Called the ""Warm Heart of Africa,"" in the native language, Malawi locals exude friendliness. It's common for strangers to wave and greet visitors as if they know them. And it's easy to make them smile with a ""moni"" (pronounced mo-nee, not money), which means hello in Chichewa, the local language, and ""Zikomo"" (thank you). Curious kids often come by to say hi and see what you're up to. The refrain I heard repeatedly was, ""Welcome. You are welcome."" Although overt friendliness often arouses suspicion in the world traveler, especially when someone's trying to sell you tchotckes, there's hardly any hawking or selling of tacky souvenirs in Malawi -- the people are genuinely friendly. Founded in 1964, Malawi has never experienced a civil war. 2. It's not crowded . You can enjoy the pristine views of massive Lake Malawi -- known locally as Lake Nyasa, it's the ninth largest lake in the world -- without having your perfect day wrecked by a bunch of vacationers blasting horrible music. Instead, you'll hear restaurants jamming 1990s pop music such as the Backstreet Boys -- can't win them all. Another perk: you won't have to jostle for reservations at hotels, restaurants or game parks. Most of the travelers you'll likely encounter in Malawi are tobacco businessmen or NGO workers -- nary a tourist in sight. Even the capital of Lilongwe has the relaxed vibe of a garden. There are few cars and you can walk to places without feeling overwhelmed or fearful of getting run over. (The country's commercial capital of Blantyre is much busier.) You can go from the high life of the Kumbali Country Lodge, where Madonna stays, or sleep in more budget accommodations. 3. Lake Malawi is spectacular . Although Malawi is landlocked, its giant, freshwater lake is its life blood. The sunny beaches of Lake Malawi are golden and the waters are nearly empty except for a few boats. Lake Malawi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's home to the largest number of fish species of any lake in the world, thought to be between 500 and 1,000, according to UNESCO. It's perfect for freshwater snorkeling and diving in clear water. The lake draws in a variety of bird species, as well as hippos, warthogs, baboons and occasional elephants. Not bad company to enjoy the water with (maybe not the hippos). 4. Rehabilitated game parks and natural reserves . Tour companies offer safaris in parks and reserves that include eco-friendly trips, mountain biking, horseback riding and traditional housing stays. One of the best known parks is Majete Wildlife Reserve, which became a target for poaching that continued into the 1990s. By the 2000s, thanks to a partnership between the government and a non-profit organization, the park was repopulated and rehabilitated. The Big Five (elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, buffalo) can be viewed here. ""Malawi is not a wildlife destination, it's not Masai Mara, but that's changing,"" says Rob McConaghy of Ulendo, a travel group operating in Malawi. ""Majete National Park is run as a private park and has reintroduced so much game, you can see the Big Five now."" 5. Easygoing vibe . Malawi is, in large part, a place of peace and quiet, without the traffic jams and hassles of city life. The country is largely rural; only 15.7% of the population live in urban areas. Clear skies and bright stars make it thrilling for star gazers. The trend is toward self-drive holidays -- visitors rent cars and drive themselves through the country. ""As a country, people perceive Malawi being safe, stable and peaceful,"" says McConaghy. ""It gives an impression of a nice, warm friendly country to travel in.""","Malawi was named one of the top 10 places to visit in 2014 by Lonely Planet .

"(CNN) -- Two American security officers have been found dead on the Maersk Alabama container ship, police in the Seychelles said Wednesday. Seychelles police identified them on Thursday as Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy. The men, both 44, were found dead on Tuesday. ""A postmortem will be carried out this week in order to establish the cause of their sudden deaths,"" police said, adding that the police investigation is ongoing. The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was targeted by Somali pirates in an attempted hijacking off the east coast of Africa in 2009. The 2013 film ""Captain Phillips"" is based on the incident. Reynolds and Kennedy worked for Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm. The company's president, Tom Rothrauff, said the men were former Navy SEALs. ""It's bizarre. Of course, it's a shock. They're all great guys,"" Rothrauff said. ""I'm absolutely clueless as to what happened."" Kevin N. Speers, a senior director for Maersk Line, said in a statement that the security contractors boarded the vessel on January 29, and that their deaths were ""not related to vessel operations or their duties as security personnel."" Maersk Line contracts with Trident Group in accordance with U.S. Coast Guard security directives, Speers said in the statement. ""Contracted security is part of anti-piracy protection plans to safeguard crews and vessels,"" Speers said. ""In Maersk Alabama's case, she is persistently in high-risk areas since she provides feeder service to the east coast of Africa."" The Maersk Alabama has since left Port Victoria, the Seychelles capital, Speers told CNN on Thursday. Senior Chief Petty Officer Daniel Tremper said the U.S. Coast Guard had been notified about the deaths of two U.S. citizens and is investigating, but ""due to the nature of the investigation, that will be about all that we can provide right now."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf confirmed the men were U.S. citizens. The Coast Guard is involved in the investigation because the Maersk Alabama is a U.S.-flagged ship, Harf said. Police said the ship arrived in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, on Sunday with a 24-man crew and had been expected to leave Tuesday. The bodies were found by a colleague who had gone to check in on one of the men in a cabin at about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, Seychelles police said. CNN first learned about the incident on Twitter. In April 2009, four armed pirates attempted to hijack the Maersk Alabama 380 miles off the coast of Somalia. After the crew sank the pirates' vessel and foiled their efforts to take control of the container ship, the pirates took the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, hostage on a lifeboat. The incident ended three days later when Navy sharpshooters killed three of the pirates and captured the fourth. Phillips was unharmed. The ship was attacked by pirates again later that year, but armed security personnel fought them off. Another attempt by pirates to board the ship, in March 2011, was thwarted when security personnel fired warning shots. 2010: Hero skipper ignored pirate warnings, crew says . 2009: Crewman's e-mail gives harrowing details of hijacking .

"(CNN) -- As a professor who sees firsthand how tough it is to get into college, I expected to hear widespread howls of protests from high school seniors and their parents when, this fall, a Kaplan Test Prep survey showed that an increasing number of college admissions officers were discovering information on Facebook and Google that hurt a student's acceptance chances. According to the Kaplan survey, 27% of admissions officers checked Google and 26% looked on Facebook as part of their applicant-review process. Thirty-five percent of those doing so -- compared with 12% in 2011 -- found material that negatively impacted their view of a student. The results of the survey would, I thought, cause college-bound students and their parents to lash out in anger. Students are under so much stress. College costs are up, and winning the admissions race seems harder than ever. With Harvard's 5.9% acceptance rate and six of the eight Ivy League schools taking in fewer than 10% of their applicants, competition is certainly tough for ambitious students. But for many others, even popular state schools are out of reach. In California, Berkeley and UCLA admit fewer than 22% of their applicants. The lack of protests over the survey results tells me that students and their parents are already so frazzled about finding the right college and the money to pay for it that they don't have the energy to fight a new battle. However, this doesn't mean we should brush aside the ethical questions that arise when college admissions officers get information about an applicant from the Internet rather than from the applicant directly. What is considered private in a student's life that may be found online? Why should material not submitted by applicants to a college be used to judge them? These are questions for which the Kaplan survey, which was anonymous and conducted at 350 schools across the country, failed to provide a consensus answer. My reaction was to see what I could learn on my own by directly contacting a handful of highly selective schools that could, if they chose, use their resources to go online and check out their applicants. I asked everyone to answer on the record, and what I found was that none of the admissions officers who responded said they made it a practice to search the Internet for information about their applicants. After that, matters got more complicated. Debra Shaver, the dean of admissions at Smith College, had this to say of student writing on the Internet: ""I do think that students can be held accountable. Those of us at residential colleges are building communities; I want students in my community who behave in a way that is civil and respectful and thoughtful."" William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's influential dean of admission, emphasized that as a general practice, the college does not proactively seek online information about applicants. ""That said, we may have occasion to encounter an applicant's digital footprint,"" he noted in an e-mail. ""This often can be positive for applicants to the degree that it helps demonstrate their range of interests and accomplishments, but could be negative if it raises serious questions about character or judgment."" Such measured responses tell me that conscientious admissions deans are not about to turn themselves into online detectives. At the same time, they are not about to turn a blind eye to facts about their applicants -- even if they come across the facts by happenstance. As Carleton's veteran dean of admissions, Paul Thiboutot, pointed out, ""We have never ignored information from any source if relevant."" At present, it is unrealistic to expect colleges to come up with a policy on admissions and social media that they can all agree on. But more candor is possible. As a result of the Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda ruling, police now inform those they arrest that whatever they say can be used against them in a court of law. Colleges that in any form use -- or may use -- the Internet to evaluate their applicants need to commit themselves to a similar, Miranda-style warning. On their websites and application forms, colleges should explicitly tell all prospective students that anything they write online can be held against them. That's the least they can do for applicants who may be dangerously naÃ¯ve about the consequences of their Facebook or Google posts. As for college-bound high school seniors, they also need to change with the times. They should take a page from the Latin maxim ""caveat emptor"": Let the buyer beware. Their new maxim should be ""caveat discipulus"": Let the student beware. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","A survey shows more colleges are finding information online that hurts applicants .

"New York (CNN) -- The third and final day of New York City's Electric Zoo music festival was canceled Sunday after two concert-goers died and at least four others were hospitalized due to drug-related causes, police said. The cause of death for the two Electric Zoo attendees is believed to involve the drug MDMA, either in Ecstasy pills or in its ""pure"" powder or crystal form, known as molly. Police identified the two victims as Jeffrey Russ, 23, and Olivia Rotondo, 20. Four others remain hospitalized and critically ill, with the causes still under investigation, according to Sgt. Lee Jones, a New York Police Department spokesman. The city recommended the electronic music festival be canceled after the recent events, and Electric Zoo's promoters, Made Event, agreed, Jones said. In a statement posted Sunday on the event's homepage, Made Event said ""the founders of Electric Zoo send our deepest condolences to the families of the two people who passed away this weekend. Because there is nothing more important to us than our patrons, we have decided in consultation with the New York City Parks Department that there will be no show today."" Social media postings regarding Electric Zoo's cancellation vary from sympathetic to downright infuriated. General admission passes cost $179 per day for the festival, held at Randall's Island Park in the East River. The promoters' website said people who bought tickets for Sunday would get full refunds. ""Large bags,"" ""bad attitudes"" and ""illegal substances"" were among the 22 listed types of items prohibited at the venue, and everyone was searched upon entry, according to the website. Founded in 2009, Electric Zoo features electronic dance music, with more than 110,000 people attending the festival in 2012. The three-day festival started on Friday and was scheduled to run through Sunday night. What is MDMA? MDMA was created in Germany in the early 1900s, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Decades later, the drug found fans across the Atlantic. During the 1970s some American psychiatrists felt they'd found in the drug a kind of ""penicillin for the soul."" The drug was said to allow for greater insights and better communication. U.S. officials disagreed, and in the 1985 the Drug Enforcement Administration banned the substance as a Schedule I drug, meaning it had no proven therapeutic value. In the 1990s, MDMA gained a reputation for party drug at all-night warehouse parties known as raves. Emergency-room visits rose steadily from 421 in 1995 to a peak of 5,542 in 2001, according to DEA statistics. Questions were raised about safety and purity of Ecstasy. That's when molly was born. Molly -- short for ""molecule"" -- is touted as the pure form of MDMA, but a spokesman for the DEA says don't believe the hype. According to Rusty Payne, the agency sees MDMA from Asia, Canada and the Netherlands. ""You have no idea the lab environment these chemicals or substances were produced in,"" Payne said. ""If they knew where things were produced, they might think twice."" In 2009, government data found 22,816 emergency-room visits due to MDMA, a 123% percent increase from 2005. But molly has fans among some in the medical field. An article published last year in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that the drug helped reduce the symptoms of PTSD for two-thirds of those enrolled in a study. Still, the sample size in that study was small, just 19 people. More studies are in the works. Despite any potential for future uses, authorities warn that the drug is dangerous. After a giant New Year's Eve party in Los Angeles in 2010, one person died and 18 others were hospitalized for issues relating to MDMA use, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CNN's Chris Kokenes and Emma Lacey-Bordeaux contributed to this report.","NEW: Police identify the two victims .

"(CNN) -- The night before he turned 40, Rich Roll had what he calls a ""moment of clarity."" Overweight and out of shape, Roll had to stop to catch his breath while walking up the stairs of his Southern California home. Roll, now a father of four, feared he was close to a heart attack. That low point prompted the entertainment attorney and former college swimmer to lose weight and get healthy. Roll not only followed through on his promise to himself and his family, he transformed his body and his life. He adopted a vegan or plant-based diet and six months later, with almost no experience, entered the extreme endurance event known as Ultraman. Ultraman is like a super-size triathlon. It's a three-day race covering 320 miles on the big island of Hawaii, including a 10-kilometer ocean swim, more than 260 miles by bike and a double marathon run. Not only did Roll finish the race, he placed 11th overall. He went on to compete in more endurance events, including EPIC5, finishing five Ironmans on five Hawaiian islands in less than a week. His accomplishments have attracted international attention and praise. In 2009, Men's Fitness magazine named Roll one of the ""25 Fittest Men in the World."" Roll is telling his amazing and inspirational story in the new book ""Finding Ultra: Rejecting Middle Age, Becoming One of the World's Fittest Men, and Discovering Myself."" He's encouraging everyone, especially middle-aged fathers, to improve their diet, fitness and long-term health. He took time out of his busy schedule to talk to CNN this week. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: Just about five years ago, you turned yourself into one of the fittest men on the planet. How are you doing today at age 45? Rich Roll: I feel fantastic and I continue to learn and refine and try to do it better. Like most people, my life is busy, and recently with the book I haven't been able to train as regularly as I've become accustomed to over the past several years. So when I'm not on my schedule the way I like to be, then I don't feel as good. But in the balance of things looking back from 5Â½ years ago to where I am now, it's nothing short of remarkable. If anything I am more a believer than I ever have been in the program that I talk about in the book and have every intention of continuing on this path. At the time, five years ago, all I wanted to do was lose a little weight and feel better. I had no idea it would lead to the life that I'm leading now. It's crazy. CNN: Between your family, your job and training, what's a typical day like for you? Roll: My schedule is different every day. Often it's dictated by what the kids have going on and what their activities happen to be so I take a tip from that. It's very fluid. I try not to be too strict every day because then I get frustrated when things don't work out the way I want them to. So I try to remain open. Generally, I get up early, I take my kids to school; then I try to squeeze in a training session, then I get some work done, then I try to squeeze another training session in. I'll pick my kids up from school. I'll work for another couple of hours. I'll have dinner with my kids, and quite often I work late into the night. See Dr. Sanjay Gupta interview Rich Roll in 2010 . CNN: What does it take to make such a major lifestyle change? Is it a question of willpower? Roll: I think it's a little bit more than that. I think the important thing to bear in mind, that's been incredibly helpful to me in many instances in my life, is to remember that mood follows action. I think it's very easy to say I'll get to that when I feel better or when I'm in the right mood, then I'll do that, or when the universe aligns and everything is perfect, then I'll dust off that dream, but it never happens. The action has to come first. You have to take the action before you know where it's going to lead you without knowing the outcome and irrespective of your mind-set or how you feel at the time. That's key and the other thing is to emphasize the importance of those dreams we all have because life is short, and there's no time like the present to set them in motion. My hope is that people can see through the extreme endurance event aspect of the book and realize that's purely intended as metaphor. Not everyone who reads my book will want to do Ultraman or become 100% vegan, but I hope it serves as inspiration for whatever that thing is you've had in the back of your mind that you always wanted to do. There is a way and a means to breathe life into those things if you're willing to prioritize it in a way you haven't done before. CNN: What advice would you give to those inspired after reading your book? Roll: The biggest thing is to not overcomplicate it and just start. You don't have to have the whole thing mapped out. You don't have to know where it's going to lead you. You shouldn't get caught up in the results of it. You just need to begin and embrace the journey and be open to where it's going to lead you. CNN: How do you maintain a balance and find time for it all? Roll: Balance is very difficult. It's something I'm always chasing and pursuing. I'm always trying to get that recipe, that chemistry perfect, but the truth is you can't do everything every day so something's got to give. I'm not a professional athlete; nobody's paying me to race. I don't make any money doing it. I've made a little bit of money writing the book but not enough to support my family, so I have to work just like everybody else. When I'm training then, I'm not earning so I have to be reasonable about the whole thing. I'm just like every other dad in that regard. CNN: You've accomplished so much in the past five years, but what's your next goal? Roll: Certainly I want to continue to push my body and see what it's capable of in an athletic concept. I love doing that, and I will continue to look for athletic challenges. That will be something I will always do, but I would say that my priorities have shifted a little bit. Now my focus and what's most important to me professionally is spreading a healthy message. I want to help inspire people through the book or get them to make healthier choices about their eating. I'm hoping the book will create a platform for me to be able to go around the country and speak to groups and kids at schools or corporations and get people eating better. Being able to have a positive impact on somebody's health, there's nothing better than that. It's extremely gratifying. So my hope and my aspiration is to be able to play a small role in trying to create a healthier America.

"(CNN) -- The hotel where Jay Z had an alleged altercation with Beyonce's sister says it has fired the person who leaked the tape to the media. ""The Standard has identified the individual responsible for breaching the security policies of the hotel and recording the confidential CCTV video released by TMZ,"" said Brian Phillips, a spokesman for the hotel. ""The Standard has already terminated the individual and will now be pursuing all available civil and criminal remedies."" In the statement, Phillips said the hotel will turn over its information to authorities. TMZ says the surveillance video is from an elevator and was taken the night of the Met Gala this month in New York. In the video, a woman who resembles Solange Knowles enters just before a man who appears to be the rapper. They appear to exchange words before the woman lunges forward and starts striking him. Another unidentified man grabs and holds her. A woman who resembles Beyonce stands in the corner of the elevator during most of the altercation. Jay Z is Beyonce's husband and Solange's brother-in-law. It's unclear what caused the fight. Representatives for Solange, Jay Z and Beyonce have not responded to CNN requests for comment. Shortly after the video was released, the hotel said it was ""shocked and disappointed"" by the breach of security. ""We are investigating with the utmost urgency the circumstances surrounding the situation and, as is our customary practice, will discipline and prosecute the individuals involved to our fullest capacity,"" it said this week.

The Hong Kong-based firm claimed the World Airline Awards title from last year's winner Emirates. It was Cathay Pacific's first victory in the most prestigious category since 2009. The award is decided by the votes of millions of travelers. A Cathay Pacific delegation received the prize from CNN's Jim Boulden. ""Of all the sellers, Cathay were the best performers across all types of travel. Some airliners were very good in economy, others in luxury, but they were top or near the top in all categories"", Edward Plaisted, CEO of Skytrax, told CNN. Speaking ahead of the show, Cathay Pacific chairman John Slosar expressed his confidence, stating: ""I believe that the Cathay Pacific team is the best and it is fantastic to see that our passengers see it the same way. ""I would certainly like to congratulate our cabin crew and everyone else in the Cathay Pacific team who make our award-winning service happen each and every day.""

"(CNN) -- Rust Cohle's pessimistic ""True Detective"" monologues expressing the meaninglessness of life have proved meaningful to one online author -- and he's accusing ""True Detective's"" writer, Nic Pizzolatto, of plagiarizing from other sources. On Monday, Mike Davis -- the editor of a site devoted to horror writer H.P. Lovecraft and Lovecraft's ""Cthulhu Mythos"" -- published a long conversation with Jon Padgett, who oversees a website devoted to the reclusive horror writer Thomas Ligotti. In the piece, the pair compare phrases from Cohle's ""Detective"" speeches with Ligotti's work and conclude that Pizzolatto plagiarized from Ligotti, lifting or paraphrasing from a Ligotti work called ""The Conspiracy Against the Human Race."" Pizzolatto has been nominated for an Emmy for his script, one of seven nominations received by the HBO series. Star Matthew McConaughey, who played Cohle, is also up for an Emmy. (HBO, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner.) ""Writers work hard to produce original ideas, stories, and dialogue, and it is unfair for another writer to pawn off those ideas as their own. Mr. Pizzolatto has been nominated for an Emmy for writing 'True Detective,' while Thomas Ligotti labors in near obscurity. Though I have agonized over whether I should write this article, in the end I felt that morally I have no choice,"" Davis wrote. Davis and Padgett's allegations were picked up by others, notably a Reddit conversation that had people on both sides of the issue. ""After reading all the examples, nothing really seemed that terrible,"" wrote lord_allonymous. ""Rust's first speech, the human consciousness one, is all lifted in practice from Ligotti's material. It is barely paraphrased. So yes, Nic P is a plagiarist,"" responded Voduar. Other observers have also doubted Davis and Padgett's conclusions as the story has made its way around the Web. Pizzolatto said there was no plagiarism involved. ""Nothing in the television show 'True Detective' was plagiarized,"" he said in a statement. ""The philosophical thoughts expressed by Rust Cohle do not represent any thought or idea unique to any one author; rather these are the philosophical tenets of a pessimistic, anti-natalist philosophy with an historic tradition including Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, E.M. Cioran, and various other philosophers, all of whom express these ideas. ... The ideas within this philosophy are certainly not exclusive to any writer."" He's freely admitted Ligotti's influence in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, as well as that of other authors. HBO stood by Pizzolatto. "" 'True Detective' is a work of exceptional originality and the story, plot, characters and dialogue are that of Nic Pizzolatto,"" the network said in a statement. ""Philosophical concepts are free for anyone to use, including writers of fiction, and there have been many such examples in the past. ... We stand by the show, its writing and Nic Pizzolatto entirely."" Of course, as Sean O'Neal of the Onion A.V. Club observed -- channeling Ligotti, Nietzsche and other philosophical wet blankets -- ""who's to say what is 'theft' in a cold and empty universe?"" For their part, the Redditors are already pessimistically downgrading their expectations for Season 2, which some noted has similarities to the movie ""Chinatown."" ""My suspicion is we get a bad season 2 and never hear from Nic P again,"" wrote Voduar. ""He doesn't have the time, he is plagiarizing a less likeable work, and for f**ks sake Colin Farrell.""

"(CNN) -- North West, the 1-year-old daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, is already a social media darling due to her mom's active presence on Instagram. Now the child's new look is sparking some controversy online. Recent photos of North wearing what appear to be diamond stud earrings have appeared online, sending the social media universe into overdrive. The photos have revived debate about whether it's safe or even appropriate to pierce babies' ears. In some cultures, it's expected and no big deal to pierce and adorn a baby's ears, but others find piercings to be an unnecessary source of pain and risk for a tot. Piercing Pagoda, a jewelry kiosk found in malls across America, has been piercing ears since 1969, and its website boasts of 20 million piercings. Some parents opt to have their babies' ears pierced at birth, but Piercing Pagoda offers services to children 2 months and older, provided they are with ""an identified parent or legal guardian,"" according to its site. Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson, executive director of digital health at Seattle Children's Hospital, recommends that parents wait until at least 6 months old, although even older is ideal. ""Ear piercing is always unnecessary, so if you're wanting to reduce all risks wait as long as you can into childhood,"" she said in an e-mail. Piercing Pagoda recommends that children have their first vaccination for tetanus before piercing, but Swanson said it's best to wait until at least 6 months old when a baby's immune system is more developed. By then, ""your baby can have three tetanus shots, along with more mature earlobes,"" she said. Swanson also recommends finding a pediatric office to do your child's piercing as the staff there is trained in sterile technique and is likely to use a pain reliever or topical anesthetic. It's unclear where North received her piercing, or if it's even a real piercing, but the procedure would be medically safe for a 1-year-old, according to Swanson. Do you think a 1-year-old is too young for ear piercing? When did you get yours done?

"(CNN) -- We had joy. We had fun. We had loathing. In 2006, this website conducted a highly unscientific survey to find the worst song of all time. One year stood out in its bad-song production: 1974. That included two of the top five -- Terry Jacks' ""Seasons in the Sun"" and the runaway top choice, Paul Anka's ""Having My Baby"" -- and several more leading vote-getters, including Paper Lace's ""The Night Chicago Died,"" Maria Muldaur's ""Midnight at the Oasis"" and Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods' ""Billy, Don't Be a Hero."" Summer rewind: Looking back at 1974 . And yet the year wasn't a pop-cultural wasteland. Far from it, as a matter of fact. As a year for movies, 1974 is often ranked as the best since the sainted slate of 1939. The releases included best picture winner ""The Godfather Part II,"" ""Chinatown,"" Mel Brooks' one-two punch of ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein,"" not to mention disaster movies, revenge flicks, conspiracy thrillers and family features. It was enough to make you kiss your movie theater while kicking your radio. These days, that kind of movie mix is almost unimaginable, when studios race to dominate box-office weekend tallies with comic-book blow-'em-ups. And music? Depends whom you ask, though it has certainly splintered over the last four decades. What gives? 'I think the country was exhausted and traumatized' It's worth a look back at an unbeloved year. With President Richard Nixon's resignation, the wind-down of the Vietnam War, the end of the Arab oil embargo, the rotting of New York, bad weather outbreaks and failing governments, it was a fatiguing time. ""I think the country was exhausted and traumatized by all the hubbub that was going on,"" says UCLA professor Mitchell Morris, the author of ""The Persistence of Sentiment,"" a book about 1970s pop music. In addition, the events ""took the wind out of the sails"" of the counterculture, which had been setting musical trends since the mid-1960s, says Georgia Tech performance studies professor Philip Auslander. Into the breach came escapist and comforting songs appealing to a new generation. Escapism and comfort often get a bad rap in pop music, Morris observes. If you're a teenager or college student trying to impress your friends and form your own cool identity, the last thing you want to confess is a fondness for ""Seasons in the Sun."" But that sort of feeling is underrated, he observes. ""One of the important roles that rock 'n' roll has played is it's the music you can use to piss off your parents,"" he says. ""(But) sometimes music is for solace. We don't like things that too obviously want to be liked. But what's wrong with wanting to be liked?"" Reinforcing confusion . At the movie theater, on the other hand, a lot of the hits were anything but comforting. Instead, they reinforced the confusion of the times. One reason is that the movie counterculture had risen to positions of power while the old studio system was falling apart. Directors such as Francis Ford Coppola and William Friedkin liked to shake up their bosses -- and the audience. ""There's sort of this brief period where Hollywood studios are willing to take a chance on smaller-budget, more independent-minded films, mainly trying to reach out to the countercultural audience that had emerged during the late 1960s,"" says Rodney Hill, a film professor at Hofstra University. That audience had made hits of such films as ""Easy Rider,"" ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""The French Connection"" and ""American Graffiti,"" among many. In fact, Coppola's original ""Godfather"" (1972) -- a gangster epic with some New Hollywood twists -- was the highest-grossing film ever at the time. The burst of creativity reached a peak in 1974 with a number of films that were both critically praised and financially successful. Coppola's ""Godfather Part II,"" despite its three-hour-plus running time and complicated structure, was the fifth biggest-grossing film of the year. Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown,"" a hard-boiled Los Angeles mystery, and Martin Scorsese's ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" about a single mother's attempt to build a life, also finished in the top 20. Brooks' comedies ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein,"" the first as anarchic as the latter was meticulous, were No. 1 and No. 3. The year's other hits included the conspiracy thriller ""The Parallax View,"" the vigilante drama ""Death Wish,"" Burt Reynolds' prison comedy ""The Longest Yard"" and the gritty ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three."" 'Boy, do we need it now' However, years are never that simple. Pop music had more variety than its bad-music boosters might remember. Joni Mitchell had her biggest success with the album ""Court and Spark."" Philadelphia International Records had big hits with the Spinners, O'Jays and the eventual theme to ""Soul Train,"" ""TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)."" Stevie Wonder was at his ""Fulfillingness' First Finale"" zenith. And movie audiences still hungered for old-fashioned pleasures. Disaster films, the all-star forerunners of today's CGI destruct-o-ramas, had both traditional heroes -- Steve McQueen's fire chief in ""The Towering Inferno,"" Charlton Heston's pilot in ""Airport 1975"" -- and the latest in special effects. There were also heartwarming, family-friendly hits, including ""Benji"" and ""The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams,"" two low-budget, no-star successes aimed at Middle America. The slogan for ""That's Entertainment,"" a hit collection of MGM musical clips, summed up the feeling: ""Boy, do we need it now."" But even ""That's Entertainment"" wasn't without its 1974 ironies, says Peter Alilunas, a media studies professor at the University of Oregon. ""MGM was falling apart. In that movie (the stars are) literally touring the destroyed back lot,"" he says. The personal touch . What can we make of all this? If 1974 did anything, it was lay the groundwork for the future. The music business was getting shaken up. Disco started making inroads. Punk was on its way, being birthed in downtown New York. ""The paradigms are about to shift,"" says Georgia Tech's Auslander, pointing out that the year's anomalies wouldn't be anomalous for long. And movies? They were going the opposite direction, getting ready to embrace the escapist blockbuster and wide openings. First came 1975's ""Jaws"" and then, two years later, 1977's ""Star Wars."" The suits reasserted control and the days of the New Hollywood ended. ""The studios are reminded, with one movie we can make as much profit as we do with all those others,"" says Hofstra's Hill. The shift continues to play out today. In the blockbuster era, it's become increasingly rare for a dialogue-heavy drama or awards-season favorite to break through. Tentpoles falling, 'Gravity' rising, money spinning: The year in movies 2013 . The music business, on the other hand, has gotten more chaotic and splintered. Whatever: Grumblers can take refuge in micro-genres and, thanks to their Pandora recommendations, never have to listen to the kind of variety AM Top 40 -- which was fading in 1974 -- used to symbolize. Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio? That's one kind of personalization. But what 1974 offered was a different kind, says Morris. Great filmmakers were following their muses and doing well. And heard today, even its much-maligned music has its charms, he says. ""There's a sense that (the artists) haven't done their market research,"" he says. ""They don't know what people necessarily want, so you get things that are very quirky at times."" That season, you might say, is all gone.","1974 featured some much-maligned pop songs but great movies .

"Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- On a dusty, pot-holed road south from the Crimean capital, Simferopol, there is a battered sign in Cyrillic. ""Yalta,"" it says, pointing the way to the town on the Black Sea where UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, USSR Premier Joseph Stalin and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt met secretly in February 1945. It was at this Crimean resort that the ""Big Three"" debated the future of Europe . Nearly 70 years later, Crimea is again at the heart of that argument. Most historians conclude that Stalin was the ""winner"" at Yalta. There was little discussion of Eastern Europe, which was soon to fall within the Soviet orbit. Churchill and Roosevelt won no meaningful concessions on Poland, already occupied by Soviet troops. The ailing U.S. President's main aim was to win agreement on setting up the United Nations, where the United States and Soviet Union would spend the next 40 years vetoing each other's resolutions in the Security Council. Yalta was the preamble to the Cold War. Facts on the ground -- the sweep westward of the Red Army -- strengthened Stalin's hand. In the House of Commons after returning from the conference, Churchill asked of the Poles: ""Are their sovereignty and independence to be untrammeled, or are they to become a mere projection of the Soviet state?"" The answer -- a sham election in 1947 that sealed Communist rule -- was not long in coming. The Iron Curtain, a term coined by Churchill, may have long fallen, holding out the promise to what former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called ""our common European home."" But arguments over sovereignty, self-determination and spheres of influence are suddenly electric again. And they are playing out in the Crimean Peninsula. Land hungry or quelling 'fascists'? The Russian flag already flies across Crimea. Pro-Ukrainian rallies attract a couple of hundred people. Most Ukrainians here seem resigned to the new order, although a steady stream have taken the train north to stay in Kiev, for the time being at least. Cossacks now guard government buildings, and the new self-installed government talks of plans for adopting the ruble and Moscow's time-zone. Billboards proclaiming ""Together With Russia"" are everywhere. Flights from Ukraine into Simferopol, currently suspended, will be directed to the international terminal if they ever resume. And a border, with barbed wire and checkpoints, is already taking shape across the neck of land that joins Crimea to the rest of Ukraine. The other evening, an elderly man shuffled in the shadow of the statue of Lenin that still dominates Simferopol's largest square. He carried a flag, the hammer and sickle of the Soviet era, and a photograph, of Stalin. To older Russians here who remember the collaboration of some Ukrainians with the Nazis, the nationalist politicians now in government in Kiev are ""fascists."" They claim the ""Right Sector"" in Ukraine is planning to sabotage Sunday's referendum in Crimea with acts of provocation. Referendum billboards in Sevastopol -- the home of Russia's Black Sea fleet -- display maps of Russia and Ukraine, the latter stamped with a swastika. And then there is the opposite narrative. Many Ukrainians -- including interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyk -- think Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to expand Russia to the old borders of the Soviet Union. They say that if Moscow is allowed to annex Crimea, it will look hungrily to eastern Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. They lament what they saw as the West's indifference when Russian tanks came within 50 miles of the Georgian capital Tbilisi in 2008. And they fear Putin will continue to do all in his power to stop Ukraine from knocking at the door of that ""common European home"" by seeking to join the European Union. Even in the Baltic states, politicians liken events today in Crimea to Stalin's gobbling up of their countries in 1940. Germany has gone as far as to reassure the Baltic republics -- which have sizeable Russian speaking minorities -- that as members of NATO they will be secure. But the alarm at unfolding events is palpable -- in Berlin, Paris and other western capitals. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Russia was taking advantage of Ukraine's weakness. That is how wars began in the 19th and 20th centuries, she said, ""which we thought we had overcome."" Historical ring in Russian warning . Putin -- buoyed by rocketing approval ratings at home -- seems unmoved by U.S. threats of what Merkel called ""massive political and economic consequences"" for Russia should it absorb Crimea. What those consequences will be remains unclear, but they seem likely to begin with visa restrictions and the freezing of foreign assets held by the new pro-Russian leadership and its supporters in Crimea. The justification would be that they have illegally and unconstitutionally taken over part of a sovereign country. Should Russia go ahead and annex Crimea, sanctions would likely be extended to prominent Russians. But the Russian military exercises close to Ukraine's eastern border over the past few days may be designed to warn that consequences will in turn have consequences. On Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a stark warning about unrest in eastern Ukraine, where Russian speakers make up about half the population. After Ukrainian and pro-Russian protesters clashed in Donetsk on Thursday, reportedly leaving two dead, Moscow said it had repeatedly warned the new government in Kiev that it must ""disarm the militants, provide security for the population and legal rights for people during demonstrations."" The Foreign Ministry statement went on: ""Russia acknowledges its responsibility for the lives of its compatriots and fellow citizens in Ukraine and reserves the right to take these people under its protection."" That too has an historical ring. Seventy-five years ago, on March 15, 1939, Adolf Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht into the Sudetenland, a German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia. His justification was simple: ""I am simply demanding that the oppression of three and a half million Germans in Czechoslovakia cease and that the inalienable right to self-determination take its place.""","70 years after ""Big Three"" debates future of Europe at Yalta, Crimea is again at heart of argument .

"(CNN) -- Scott Peterson was convicted November 12, 2004, for the deaths of his wife, Laci Peterson, and their unborn child. He may be locked up in San Quentin State Prison and facing the death penalty, but he is not cut off from the outside world. Sharon Rocha, mother of Laci Peterson, says Scott Peterson shouldn't be blogging from San Quentin. Peterson has a personal Web site that includes photos of him and Laci. It also links to his family's Web site and that Web site includes a blog message from Scott discussing what he calls his ""wrongful conviction."" Sharon Rocha, Laci Peterson's mother, appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Thursday to talk about his Web site and what she thinks of her former son-in-law. Some highlights: . Larry King: What do you make of all this? Sharon Rocha: Well. First of all, I think I could say that being on death row is supposed to eliminate a lot of rights and privileges of the inmates. In the whole scope of things, this is a very minute matter, but it isn't right that they should have access to the Internet, either direct access or through somebody else.  Watch Rocca discuss Scott Peterson with Larry King » . King: How and when did you first find out about Scott having this Web page? Rocha: Just a couple of days ago. A friend of mine had told me about it. King: Have you seen the page? Rocha: I have. And I understand it's the family blog, which, you know, they're entitled to have that. But I still feel that it's not right that Scott has the ability to speak on the Internet through his family or friends or whomever. King: So you think a family blog is OK? Rocha: Everybody's entitled, you know, to their opinion, and I see nothing wrong with having a family blog. King: He has only two blog entries on his personal page. One says he's encouraged by the mail he receives and he enjoys hearing from people. His prison mail address is also posted. What do you think of that? Rocha: Well, I think that is public knowledge. There are different Web sites that you can go to get that prison. But as far as being encouraged from other people, I'm sure he is. But the point is I don't think he should be able to access the Internet, either directly or through anybody else. King: Do you have any qualms about people writing to him? Does it bother you at all? Rocha: No, it doesn't bother me. To be perfectly honest with you, Larry, I really don't spend a lot of time thinking about Scott. I think about Laci all of the time, but I don't give a lot of thought to Scott. King: In his first blog posting, Scott writes, ""some people have done things to profit off my wife and son having been taken from me and murdered."" How do you react to a statement like that? Rocha: Well, that's true. There have been a lot of people who have profited from that. But I don't feel that he should be one of those because he's responsible for Laci not being here. I know many inmates are claiming that it violates their rights, their right to freedom of speech not to be able to have communication with, through the Internet or what have you. But they are there for a reason and that reason is that they took the right of their victims. They took their freedom of speech away from them and literally slammed the lid on their opportunity to ever speak again. King: Have you complained to the prison or anybody in authority about all of this? Rocha: No, I haven't. It's not something that I've even thought about. I read an article in ""The (Los Angeles) Times"" about victims in other states who attempted to have legislation passed only to have it ruled as unconstitutional by a judge. So I don't know if there's really anything that can be done about it. King: So you have no recourse, in a sense. Rocha: At this time, it seems to be that way, unless there's some new legislation that can actually be passed and not ruled unconstitutional. King: Frankly, Sharon, you don't seem outraged. Rocha: Well, it is outrageous for this to even be happening. I just feel that, you know, it just does a great injustice to the victims and their families. They can no longer speak for themselves. And being on death row is supposed to eliminate an inmate's privileges. And this just flies in the face of justice, as far as I'm concerned, that OK, so they said they can't use the Internet, they go around it and they use it in another way. It is outrageous. I am outraged.","Laci Peterson's mother: Scott Peterson should not have right to blog in prison .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The sexual abuse of children is not just a ""heinous crime"" but a ""grave sin"" that offends God and wounds human dignity, Pope Benedict XVI said Tuesday after a two-day meeting with Irish Catholic bishops at the Vatican. The weakening of faith has also been a ""significant contributing factor"" in the sexual abuse of minors, the pope said, adding that ""current painful situation will not be resolved quickly."" The pope's comments came in a written Vatican statement at the end of the meeting, the largest one yet about the scandal that has rocked the church from Ireland to the Vatican and beyond. A damning report by an independent Irish commission in November found the Catholic Church in Ireland had covered up the ""widespread"" abuse of children from 1975 to 2004. It led to the resignation of four Irish bishops late last year and prompted the pope to say at the time he was ""deeply disturbed and distressed"" by the report's findings. A group representing alleged victims of abuse said the pope had not gone far enough. Victims are ""angered his Holiness did not see fit to take the necessary firm action against those in the Irish Church hierarchy who protected pedophiles,"" said John Kelly, the founder of Irish Survivors of Child Abuse. The pope ""has clearly failed the victims and the Irish people,"" he added. Asking the bishops to address the problem ""shows lack of vision, especially as it is the Irish bishops who are themselves the problem,"" Kelly said in the written statement. There was no discussion at this week's meeting about further resignations, said papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi. Those at the meeting ""recognized that this grave crisis has led to a breakdown in trust in the church's leadership and has damaged (the church's) witness to the gospel and its moral teaching,"" the Vatican statement said. ""The bishops spoke frankly of the sense of pain and anger, betrayal, scandal and shame expressed to them on numerous occasions by those who had been abused,"" it said. It said ""significant measures have now been taken"" to ensure the safety of children in the church. ""For his part, the Holy Father observed that the sexual abuse of children and young people is not only a heinous crime, but also a grave sin which offends God and wounds the dignity of the human person created in his image,"" the statement said. The pope challenged the bishops to address past problems with ""determination and resolve"" and to face the current crisis with ""honesty and courage."" ""The Holy Father also pointed to the more general crisis of faith affecting the church and he linked that to the lack of respect for the human person, and how the weakening of faith has been a significant contributing factor in the phenomenon of the sexual abuse of minors,"" the statement said. ""He stressed the need for a deeper theological reflection on the whole issue, and called for an improved human, spiritual, academic and pastoral preparation both of candidates for the priesthood and religious life and of those already ordained and professed."" The pope wrote a pastoral letter to Irish Catholics to be issued during Lent, the 40-day period between Ash Wednesday, which happens tomorrow, and Easter, the Vatican said. ""The Holy Father has asked that this Lent be set aside as a time for imploring an outpouring of God's mercy and the holy spirit's gifts of holiness and strength upon the church in Ireland,"" the statement said. At a Mass in Rome on Monday before meeting the pope, the Irish Catholic bishops prayed for the victims of the abuse in Ireland, said their spokesman, Martin Long. One of the bishops said Sunday that the church in Ireland had been badly damaged by the revelations of abuse and cover-up. ""I would admit quite frankly what everybody else knows, shouted from house tops, that the church has been seriously wounded,"" Bishop Joseph Duffy said in Rome. ""This has done an immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Of that there is no doubt,"" he said. The pope already met in December with senior Irish bishops about the report, produced by the Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation. The Irish government created the commission in 2006 to examine abuse allegations.","Weakening of faith a ""significant contributing factor"" in child sex abuse, pope says .

Singapore has dethroned the Japanese capital to become the world's most expensive city in 2014, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's latest Worldwide Cost of Living survey. The bi-annual report, which ranks 131 global cities, credits currency appreciation, solid price inflation and high costs of living for Singapore's dubious new distinction. ""Car costs have very high related certificate of entitlement fees attached to them, which makes Singapore significantly more expensive than any other location when it comes to running a car,"" says the report. ""As a result, transport costs in Singapore are almost three times higher than in New York. In addition, as a city-state with very few natural resources to speak of, Singapore is reliant on other countries for energy and water supplies, making it the third most expensive destination for utility costs."" Singapore is also the priciest place in the world to buy clothes. Last year's title holder Tokyo, dropped from the top spot to sixth -- tied with Melbourne, Geneva and Caracas. Tokyo's decline is due to the weaker yen, says the EIU. World's 10 most expensive cities to live in 2014 . 1. Singapore . 2. Paris . 3. Oslo, Norway . 4. Zurich, Switzerland . 5. Sydney . 6. Caracas, Venezuela . 6. Geneva, Switzerland . 6. Melbourne . 6. Tokyo . 7. Copenhagen, Denmark . Asia also has the world's cheapest city on the list. Down at the other end of the 131-city survey, the EIU lists Mumbai as the world's least expensive city to live in. The Indian capital, New Delhi, is third cheapest. ""Although India has been tipped for future growth, much of this is driven by its large population and the untapped potential within the economy,"" says the EIU. ""Income inequality means that low wages proliferate, driving down household spending and creating many tiers of pricing that keep per capita spending low. ""This, combined with a cheap and plentiful supply of goods into cities, as well as government subsidies on some products, has kept prices down, especially by Western standards.""

In total, more than 50,000 individual prices are collected in each survey. ""The cost-of-living index uses an identical set of weights that is internationally based and not geared toward the spending pattern of any specific nationality,"" says the EIU.

"(CNN) -- One month after Typhoon Haiyan tore through six Philippine islands, the death toll stands at 5,924 and 1,779 people are still missing, according to government figures released Sunday. More than 12 million people have been affected by the monster typhoon that left behind catastrophic scenes of destruction and despair when it made landfall on November 8, the government said. It left entire communities without immediate access to food and medical care. Several countries, including the United States, have been aiding in the recovery. According to the Pentagon, the military effort, dubbed Operation Damayan, cost $32 million. At their peak, the relief efforts involved more than 13,400 U.S. military personnel, 66 aircraft and 12 naval vessels. Two weeks ago, the U.S. scaled down its operation in the Philippines, but USAID continues to provide food and support as the recovery continues.

"(CNN) -- American journalist James Foley was murdered, beheaded by an English-speaking member of ISIS, the extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State and has already conquered large swaths of two Middle Eastern countries. The sickening execution, recorded and released online for the world to see, came with a warning to the U.S.: ISIS showed another captive American journalist, believed to be Steven Sotloff, and threatened to kill him too if the U.S. does not stop helping those fighting to stop ISIS advances. The killing and the threat, along with all the evidence ISIS is leaving as it gouges its way across the region, are a direct challenge to the American people, to the U.S. government and to the international community. As it makes increasingly clear what kind of an organization it is, ISIS is sending a message: ""Stay out of this, so we can keep driving toward our objective."" President Obama said Wednesday that ""We will do everything we can to protect our people ... The entire world is appalled by the brutal murder."" The U.S. government has crucial steps to take now. First, obviously, it cannot give into ISIS threats and must continue helping dislodge ISIS from northern Iraq where it is engaging in ethnic cleansing against Christians and other minorities; kidnapping, raping and selling women; and massacring people. The U.S. effort should keep a special focus on helping America's loyal and ideologically moderate friends, the Kurds of Iraq. At the same time, the U.S. should make a strong diplomatic push to obtain international legitimacy for the campaign to defeat ISIS. It is important to prevent ISIS from scoring a recruiting victory among Muslims and anti-Western and anti-American camps by portraying this as a war between Islam and the West, which it is not. There are few people on Earth who are not horrified by ISIS. That includes the overwhelming majority of Muslims. The grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, called ISIS and al Qaeda ""Enemy No. 1"" of Islam. Countless Muslims have criticized and condemned them. ISIS is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to ISIS. They kill minorities, Shiite Muslims and Sunnis who don't abide by their views. They are virulently opposed to the West, to the U.S., to modernity and to anyone who sees the world differently from their narrow medieval perspective. The U.S. should seek a U.N. resolution declaring that the international community, including the Muslim world, considers ISIS and its methods repugnant. Any country that disagrees, any government that is not revolted by ISIS and troubled by its methods and its goals, should go on record saying so. Before ISIS, we knew that human beings are capable of unspeakable brutality. But anyone who thought man's inhumanity to man had eased after the mass crimes of the 20th century now knows better. ISIS didn't just remind us how cruel humans can be; it has taken the use of brutality as a weapon of intimidation, extermination, genocide and recruitment propaganda to new levels. ISIS is not the first to murder victims in large numbers; it is not the first to kill those who disagree with its beliefs or who belong to different ethnic or religious groups. But it seems no group has advertised its bloodlust with such relish and effectiveness. More important, those using these methods, embracing this philosophy, are in control of enormous territories. When ISIS calls itself a state, it is not hyperbole by very much. ISIS has taken over a a tract of land bigger than many countries, something that al Qaeda, its comparatively mild-mannered inspiration, never came close to achieving. ISIS has established and gained full dominion not only of cities and populations but of wealthy oil-producing lands. It is now financially self-sufficient, collecting millions of dollars every day from oil smuggling operations. If not stopped, it could continue its push toward the oil fields of southern Iraq at the edge of the Persian Gulf, which remains the epicenter of oil and gas production that allows the global economy to function. If Osama bin Laden weren't dead, he would die of envy. ISIS views the videos of mass executions, of severed heads on poles and of crucified men, as a way to keep its enemies frightened and weakened, and a way to tell prospective recruits that it is fearless in its war to create an Islamic caliphate ruling over all the world's Muslims. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, incidentally, claims to rule over all Muslims and believes the ultimate goal of ISIS is to take over huge sections of Asia, Europe and Africa. The killing of Foley, an idealistic journalist, sharpens our understanding of the organization seeking to dominate the Middle East. That the man who murdered him might have been British should erase any remaining fantasy in the West that this gruesome war, now raging in Syria and Iraq, will stay within any country's or any region's borders. Those who seek to downplay the risk to the United States should think again. Britain has confirmed that Foley's killer was most likely a British citizen. There have been reports of hundreds, even thousands, of Europeans training, fighting and killing alongside ISIS. In June 2013, a video from Syria surfaced, showing men cutting off another man's head. To the shock of Europeans, they were heard speaking Dutch. The ISIS members who hold European passports are able to travel freely across Europe and the U.S. and are prepared to do the unthinkable. There are hundreds of Germans, Spaniards, Belgians, French. Graduates of the Syria war, from where ISIS pushed into Iraq, have killed in Europe. And ISIS ideology is gaining support in the continent. Last month, ISIS flags flew in an anti-Israel demonstration in the Hague, chanting against America and the West and most enthusiastically, ""Death to the Jews."" ISIS can simply not be allowed to keep a foothold in the Middle East. If it does, the consequences will become even more catastrophic. In Iraq alone, 1.2 million people have been displaced, thousands killed. It is politically and strategically complicated, because ISIS is also fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah, and defeating ISIS would also be enormously pleasing to Iran. But the group is a growing threat. The strategy of supporting the Kurds and the Iraqis in the front lines is a good one. It must be bolstered with material and diplomatic support. If it proves insufficient to turning back the bloody ISIS tide, then it must be revamped. Foley's mother said her son gave his life trying to expose to the world the suffering of the Syrian people. That suffering has now extended to Iraq, and it will only become more widespread if ISIS is not stopped.","Frida Ghitis: U.S. cannot give in to ISIS threats, must focus on helping Kurds of Iraq .

"There are more than 7,000 islands and reefs sprinkled throughout the Caribbean Sea. Isn't it time you explored some place new? We've unearthed six singular destinations where you can stake out your own quiet stretch of sand. Isla de Providencia, Colombia The residents of Providencia, a 25-minute flight from neighboring San Andrés Island, make much of their association with Sir Henry Morgan, the 17th-century swashbuckler de picted on rum bottles worldwide. As well they should: Only a 492-foot-long floating bridge separates Providencia from Santa Catalina, one of Morgan's favorite bases. A quarter-mile hike to the top of Providencia's El Pico yields 360-degree views of pristine rain forests and of the area where Morgan hid his loot. Near Aguadulce Bay, Hotel El Pirata Morgan's 27 rooms have private balconies, many overlooking the pool (011-57/8-514-8232, from $62). About four miles away at Playa Manzanillo, Roland Roots Bar hosts beach parties with reggae music and drinks served in coconut shells (no phone, from $7.75). Comarca Kuna Yala, Panama One of Panama's largest indigenous groups, the Kuna people have lived on the Comarca Kuna Yala chain of more than 350 islands and coral cays since the 1600s. Kuna women make and sell molas, swatches of hand-embroidered cloth in vivid purples, reds, and blues that are typically made into garments. The men spend their days fishing for grouper and mackerel and leading visitors on boat trips to the archipelago's dozens of uninhabited islands, some barely 100 yards wide. Many hotels here offer immersive, all-inclusive experiences. At Cabañas Uaguinega on Achutupu Island, 45 minutes from Panama City by air, the rate for a bamboo-walled, solar-powered cabin covers two tours or cultural outings daily and all meals (uaguinega.com, from $140 per person). Water Island, U.S. Virgin Islands To call Heidi's Honeymoon Grill a restaurant would be an overstatement it's a food truck that parks on the beach and serves patrons seated at picnic tables but it's about as close to an actual restaurant as you'll get on this 490-acre speck of land a 10-minute ferry ride from St. Thomas. Honeymoon Beach serves as the unofficial community center for Water Island's 161 residents, hosting Monday night golf-cart drive-in movies, Wednesday night bingo, and candlelit gourmet dinners catered by Heidi's on Saturday evenings (340/777-5288, $25). Most people stay in one of the more than a dozen vacation homes (vrbo.com, from $1,200 for a week). Budget Travel: The Dominican Republic's last frontier  Anegada, British Virgin Islands The 32-mile Horseshoe Reef surrounds tiny Anegada, a low-slung coral atoll that's a 12-minute flight from Beef Island. What the reef means for travelers is a lot more than great snorkeling; it protects some of the longest beaches in the British Virgin Islands and has also netted 200-plus shipwrecks, ripe for divers' explorations. Pomato Point Restaurant, on the southwest shore, is known as much for its museum of shipwreck artifacts as it is for its swordfish and conch dishes (284/495-9466, entrées from $20). At the nearby Neptune's Treasure hotel, paintings of boats on stormy seas hang in the nine rooms, set about 150 feet from the water (neptunestreasure.com, from $95). Terre-de-Haut, Guadeloupe You could be forgiven a double take upon arriving at Terre-de-Haut, a 45-minute ferry ride from Grande-Terre, Guadeloupe: It's like a slice of northwestern France, with goats nibbling scrubby plants on the hillsides and a culture steeped in the ways of early settlers from Brittany. In the villages, fishermen still mend nets on their front porches, while women sell tropical fruit tarts (called tourment d'amour) from wicker baskets. Even the 12 guest rooms at Auberge Les Petits Saints are decorated with French antiques (petitssaints.com, from $131). But it's not all about old times a cosmopolitan yachting crowd regularly drops anchor (and their swimsuits) at the west coast's Anse Crawen beach. Budget Travel: Nonstop Caribbean: Fly right to the beach . Carriacou, Grenada There's no need to worry about high-rise resorts blocking your view on this 13-square-mile island a 22-minute flight from Grenada; unwritten law forbids building a hotel taller than the average palm tree. Near Hillsborough, on the island's west coast, the appropriately sized Green Roof Inn rents six rooms and two cottages with Wi-Fi and sea-view verandas (greenroofinn.com, from $70). Carriacou is also known for the easy coexistence of cultural traditions passed down by both West African slaves and early 19th-century Scottish settlers. Ritual ""big drum"" dances remain a vital part of life here; they're performed for funerals and festivals, including the Carriacou Regatta, in which sailors race boats built according to old Irish and Scottish shipwrights' plans. Flight and ferry news . In October, US Airways increased nonstop service from Philadelphia to Barbados, and JetBlue added flights from New York City to St. Lucia and Barbados. The same month, ferry company Bedy Oceanline launched new daily routes connecting those two islands with Grenada, St. Vincent, and Trinidad (bedytravel.com, from $90 round trip).

"(CNN) -- A freak injury while playing an impromptu game of football with his teammates could sideline Norwegian skiing great Aksel Lund Svindal for the entire World Cup season. The five-time world champion was training in Soelden in Austria ahead of the opening races at that ski resort next week when he tore his Achilles tendon. Svindal described on his official Facebook page what had happened. ""I was out for a little run with the rest of the team... We ended the session playing around with a ball. Just holding it up in the air between us. ""Suddenly I felt something snap in my leg and I knew right away that something was wrong. Achilles."" Svindal, a two-time overall World Cup champion, was rushed to hospital in Innsbruck, 100km away, and underwent surgery straight away. ""Extremely bad timing just as the season is about to start. But now that it's happened there's not much I can do,"" he wrote. ""Nobody can say 100% sure how long the recovery will take, but I'm ready for the weeks that are coming."" Norway team doctor Jacob Strauss gave a gloomy verdict. ""He will probably not get back on his skis before three or four months."" Svindal was due to defend his world downhill title at the championships in Beaver Creek in Colorado next February and the setback places that in some doubt. The 2010 Olympic super-G gold medalist is no stranger to injury and missed most of the 2007-8 season after a heavy crash at Beaver Creek on the testing Birds of Prey course.

"EVANSVILLE, Indiana (CNN) -- With the pump reading $4.29 a gallon, many of the gas station's patrons are more than a little grumpy. But, one by one, they are approached by Dominique Morson. Sen. Barack Obama is looking to turn Indiana from red to blue in November. ""Excuse me, sir: Are you registered to vote, and if so is it at your current address?"" she asks. She is polite and persistent, approaching more than two dozen customers during an hour or so at a gas station in Evansville, Indiana, a blue-collar community in southern Indiana not far from the Kentucky border. Of those she approaches, most say they are already registered, several say they are not, but not interested. Three, though, stop and answer the questions as Morson fills out the state's registration form and then hands it over for the new applicant to sign. She is not alone. Another handful of Sen. Barack Obama volunteers work the lot, while a dozen more go door to door in Evansville, part of a major grassroots effort aimed at turning one of the most reliably Republican states in presidential politics from red to blue. ""I think we can. I really do,"" Morson told us during a quick break from her efforts. ""We have enough people dedicated to the campaign and enough people who want to see some change, so I think we will."" The fact that Indiana even makes the list of battleground states is itself stunning. George W. Bush won the state with 57 percent in 2000 and 60 percent in 2004. The last time Indiana backed a Democrat for president was Lyndon Johnson 44 years ago. Obama's chances here could rest on the aggressive voter registration and identification effort. When Obama campaign volunteers register a voter, they also add them to the Obama database, and maintain contact with the voter. Voter registration is nonpartisan, so there is no way of knowing for sure how many of the new voters -- and those who have erased any eligibility questions by updating their addresses -- are Democrats. But Republican Secretary of State Todd Rokita, the state's chief elections officer, said Sen. John McCain's campaign had better take notice. ""They have a fight here in Indiana and it is real,"" Rokita said. The numbers are dramatic: In 2004, 2.5 million ballots were cast for president in Indiana. And in that entire cycle, the state received some 565,000 new and updated registrations. This year, the number is already in excess of 562,000 and given the recent spike in activity by campaigns and other organizations, Rokita tells CNN he expects to hit a record 750,000 by the state's October 6 registration deadline. ""I will say that this is the first time I have ever seen a Democratic presidential campaign this engaged in this state. Usually Indiana is No. 1 for the red states on election night when it comes to president,"" Rokita told CNN in an interview in his state Capitol office in Indianapolis. While Obama allies are upbeat, to travel the state is to find proof that to turn Indiana blue will be a difficult challenge. Its farm communities and small towns lean conservative. In Washington, for example, President Bush carried 75 percent of the vote four years ago. It is a town of about 11,000 and home of the Williams Bros. health care and pharmaceutical supply company. Mark Williams takes visible pride in the fourth-generation family enterprise, and says in his view McCain is more in tune with his needs as a small businessman, and with his views of the proper role of government in issues like health care reform. His take is significant: Though he is a registered Republican, Williams was not a Bush fan and voted Democratic for president in 2000 and 2004. This year, he says experience matters and McCain is far more ready in his view. He also rejects the frequent Obama attempts to link McCain to Bush. ""When you look a the resumes between McCain and Sen. Obama ... Sen. McCain is a lot more experienced,"" Williams said in an interview in his office filled with memorabilia of a business that stretches back generations. Of McCain he says, ""He has never stood by the rules of the Republicans. He has always voted the way he believes. He tells people what they need to hear not always the most popular thing."" In Evansville, too, there is plenty of evidence that Obama faces long odds here. As volunteers went door to door in a blue-collar neighborhood Sunday for nearly an hour, they came across just one voter who promised to support the Democratic nominee. One said he was a definite McCain voter, and several others said they were undecided, and accepted literature from the volunteers.","Democrats and the Obama campaign see Indiana in play .

"Editor's Note: Anthony J. Badger is Paul Mellon Professor of American History at Cambridge University and Master of Clare College. He is the author of ""FDR: The First Hundred Days,"" ""North Carolina and the New Deal"" and ""The New Deal: The Depression Years, 1933 --1940."" Anthony Badger says Barack Obama's administration could learn lessons from the New Deal. CAMBRIDGE, England (CNN) -- Students here in Cambridge watched in horror in September 2005 as they saw lines of desperate people snaked round the convention center and the Superdome in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. In the past couple of months, they watched with admiration the lines outside polling stations both on Election Day and in the early voting states. They found it difficult to imagine that voters in Britain would be prepared to queue for hours to vote. No American election in recent history has aroused such interest in Britain among old and young alike. Partly, this is the result of the compelling drama of the long drawn-out primary battles, partly the result of the feeling that, whichever candidate was elected, there would be an end to the ""arrogant unilateralism"" (Robert McNamara's phrase in Cambridge in 2002) of U.S. foreign policy. Partly, of course, it was the powerful narrative of an African-American running for the White House. Each August I teach 35 American high school teachers about the civil rights movement for the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History in the far-removed historic buildings of Clare College. This year they reported their students were unprecedentedly enthusiastic about both Barack Obama and the political process. I expressed deep skepticism that an African-American candidate could win a southern state. They had more faith in southern voters and they were right and I was wrong. As I have told British audiences, it was a stunning achievement for an African-American candidate to carry Virginia for the Democrats when three white southerners -- Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Al Gore -- failed to do so. Now that President-elect Obama is preparing to take office, I was interested to hear he is reading about President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first 100 days in office. The situations in 1933 and 2009 do have similarities. In both cases, there is a discredited outgoing administration, a financial crisis, a lame-duck Congress which finds it difficult to act, a new President who is a talented communicator and has a popular election victory and large congressional majorities. But 1933 was also very different from the situation that will face Obama in January. The Depression had been going on for four years. Between a quarter and a third of the industrial workforce was out of work. Farmers, who were a third of the workforce then, were desperate. There were none of the stabilizers that exist now to protect ordinary Americans: no bank deposit insurance, no social security and the welfare and relief resources of private charities and local and state governments were exhausted. The day FDR took office, the banks in New York and Chicago closed. The whole U.S. banking system ground to a halt. The result was that Congress was desperate for bold leadership. Constituents let their representatives know that they expected them to support the president as if the country was at war. When FDR proclaimed a national bank holiday and worked to reopen the banks, Republicans and Democrats supported him. The House passed the banking bill -- and they only had one copy of it -- in 43 minutes. When Roosevelt addressed the nation on Sunday, March 12, it was a tremendous gamble. He told Americans it was safer to put their money back in the banks reopening the next day than to hide it under the mattress. They believed him and the next day the money flowed back into the banks that had been allowed to open. There was no Plan B: If people had continued taking money out, absolute disaster would have followed. Despite four months to prepare -- FDR was the last president to be inaugurated in March -- Roosevelt had no great template to put into effect when he took office. He seized opportunities. He used the banking proposals of holdover Republican officials at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. He proposed the National Recovery Act only after Congress threatened to pass share-the-work legislation that would have mandated a maximum 30- hour work week. He only brought Harry Hopkins to Washington to set up a national relief program after existing appropriations relief allocation to the states ran out. He did not favor bank deposit insurance but accepted it. He accepted large public works spending reluctantly. FDR had a penchant for quick-fix solutions for the economy like currency tinkering. But he also launched the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Tennessee Valley Authority, crop control programs for farmers, and regulation of the stock market and the banks, and he underwrote the refinancing of mortgage debt on a long-term basis. Are there lessons for President-elect Obama? Perhaps there are several. First, in the New Deal's industrial recovery programs, a provision for loans to businesses disappeared. As a result there was no mechanism for creating extra jobs in the private sector. Perhaps Obama should preserve jobs in the economy by bailing out the auto industry. Second, infrastructure investment works, as the New Deal's public works programs showed in highways, education, cheap electrical power and flood control. Third, the first 100 days can be a window of opportunity to pass reforms that will not be possible later on, but complex structural changes -- like FDR's introduction of social security -- may have to wait. For Obama, health care reform may be one of those issues that has to wait. And finally, responding to an economic crisis requires the ability to improvise, to work across the aisle and to take measures that might at first be at odds with your original plans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Badger.","Anthony Badger: British students impressed that Americans stood in lines to vote .

"(CNN) -- Al Capone's legend of bootlegging, gangland slayings and tax evasion lives on more than 60 years after the Chicago gangster's death. Now comes a footnote that is a sign of the times: foreclosure. Al Capone's former Wisconsin hideaway goes on the auction block on Thursday. A Wisconsin lodge that may have been one of Capone's old hideouts goes on the auction block this week with a starting bid of $2.6 million. The two-story stone lodge, tucked away on 407 acres in Couderay, Wisconsin, was owned by the Capone family in the 1920s. It will be auctioned Thursday on the steps of the Sawyer County Courthouse, three hours from Minneapolis, Minnesota, according to an ad in the Chicago Tribune. The property includes a 37-acre lake and eight-car garage. The Tribune ad was placed in September by the Chippewa Valley Bank. The property, owned by Hideout Inc. owner Guy Houston, went into foreclosure in April 2008. The Houston family purchased the property in the 1950s and transformed the home into a tourist spot. Visitors paid a few dollars for a walking tour of Capone's reputed hideout. iReport.com: More views of Capone's compound . The lodge is fortified with stone walls at least a foot thick and a guard tower. There is a separate facility that resembles a jail on site. ""There has been a ton of interest since we ran the article,"" said Joe Kinnear, vice president of Chippewa Valley Bank in Wisconsin. He added that at least 100 buyers have expressed interest. Neither Houston nor the property owner's attorney, Todd Smith, could be reached by CNN. Since bank officials announced a few weeks ago that Capone's hideaway was for sale, the news has traveled across the country -- and the world. The property holds enormous nostalgic value, Kinnear said. After all, he noted, Al Capone's name is closely associated with Chicago, Illinois. ""This guy really has incredible fame power,"" said John Russick, senior curator at the Chicago History Museum. ""He became this icon for a whole profession of underworld figures, and people are fascinated with that."" With his expensive suits, wide-brimmed fedora and cigar, the gangster who relished the media spotlight became the face of lawlessness during the Prohibition era. From 1925 to 1931, Capone was Chicago's most notorious organized-crime boss. He ruthlessly relied on intimidation, bribes and violence, according to gangster lore. Even some state and local law enforcement officers turned a blind eye when Capone's gang committed crimes, leaving the feds to chase him, historians say. But life as a crime kingpin brought a growing list of enemies, said Arthur J. Lurigio, a professor of criminology at Loyola University Chicago, who is also working on a documentary and book about organized crime in Chicago. ""He wanted to get away from his enemies,"" Lurigio explained. ""He had already escaped death several times."" Lurigio said the Wisconsin hideout was probably just one of many retreats. Capone found respite at properties in Indiana, Michigan and Florida, too. The rural locations were ideal because Capone's rivals wouldn't travel that far to hunt him down, Lurigio said. No one can say for certain whether Al Capone ever stayed in the Wisconsin lodge. Because he operated an illegal business, there are few written documents with clues on where he spent his time, historians say. State University of New York at Oswego professor emeritus Luciano Iorizzo, who wrote ""Al Capone: A Biography"" in 2003, said he has never come across evidence that Capone visited the Wisconsin hideout. Jim Ferguson, vice president of the Sawyer County Historical Society, said there is no hard evidence that Capone visited the property, though some locals say they spotted Capone in their community. More likely, Ferguson said, Capone's brother, Ralph, who was in charge of soda bottling plants, lived on the property at some time. ""It was a very nice place,"" said Ferguson, who visited the property several times when it was open to tourists. ""There was an open staircase going up to the second floor and a second-floor balcony."" The lodge, which the owners claims has the original Capone furnishings, was cozy, he recalled. The antique furniture captured the wooded Wisconsin lifestyle, Ferguson said. Animal pelts and elk heads decorated the walls. If Capone did indeed retreat to the Couderay property, there was plenty of game to hunt, and the lakes are famous for fishing. According to historians, the 6-foot-tall, 200-pound crime boss enjoyed outdoor sports. He was an amateur athlete who began boxing in his adolescence and battled top fighters of the time, including Lou Ordoni and Babe Lancaster. Henry Binford, a professor of history at Northwestern University, theorizes that the hideout was a stopover in the transportation of liquor to Chicago during Prohibition. It's rumored among locals that planes from Canada that were filled with alcohol docked on the small lake. ""Being an ostensible businessman, he had a lot of channels of supply,"" said Binford, who points out that the lodge is located close to the Canadian border. Capone's illegal activities caught up with him in the 1930s. His most infamous mob war, the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago that killed seven rivals, further enticed federal agents to catch him. In 1931, he was convicted of tax evasion and sent to Alcatraz prison in California. This summer, when the hideout tours were shut down, Leslie Strapon, assistant executive director of the Hayward Chamber of Commerce, said her office received hundreds of calls from disappointed tourists. ""Everyone is patiently waiting to see what's going to happen with the place,"" she said. ""It would be nice if it fell into the hands of someone who was wiling to reopen and carry on the tradition.""","Wisconsin lodge is up for auction this week .

"ARLINGTON, Texas (CNN)  -- To begin with, Gregory Rose didn't have health insurance. Plus, it was finals week. So his first instinct was to ignore the pain. A nurse takes blood from Gregory Rose, who has leukemia. A walk across his apartment convinced him otherwise. ""My hip was like on fire, grinding"" is how he recalled the morning seven months ago that changed everything. ""I know pain, and I've never felt that kind of pain before,"" Rose said. At the hospital, a blood test with startling results: a dramatically elevated white blood cell count. He had leukemia, at 23. Rose had no health insurance because he was too old to be covered on his parents' policy and too young and seemingly healthy to think he needed it. So count Rose among the estimated 47 million Americans who lack health insurance, and as a resident of a state with the highest percentage of uninsured: Nearly one in four Texans do not have health coverage. Despite no coverage, he received expert care through the JPS Health Network, a county hospital that sees 800,000 patients a year, and where fewer than 7 percent of the patients have private health insurance. ""I have had excellent doctors --- excellent doctors,"" Rose said. ""The chemo just wears you down. I had to be admitted for five days every time, every three weeks."" He is cared for through a hospital program called JPS Connection, which is geared to help those without insurance get care --- and to look to see if they are eligible for any government assistance. Rose initially was put on Medicaid, then at a social worker's suggestion applied for Social Security disability payments. But after he started receiving them, his Medicaid was cut off because Texas is one of a dozen states that counts such payments against its income standards for Medicaid. ""Now I have no insurance again,"" he said with a sigh. ""Godspeed"" is how Robert Earley, the JPS CEO, responds when the health care debate in Washington is brought up. Nearly 15 percent of the hospital's patients are on Medicare, another 14 percent Medicaid. Most don't have any coverage. So while he backs effort to find a way to cover the millions of uninsured Americans, Earley and his chief of medicine, Dr. Gary Floyd, said they worry President Obama's plan to pay for his effort to overhaul health care, in part, by squeezing billions from Medicare and Medicaid could do as much or more harm than good. ""Then you either cut services or you cut payments to providers,"" Floyd said. ""And in Texas we have a significant problem with Medicaid. Only 38 percent of our physicians participate in Medicaid programs. ... So if we start squeezing the payment rates down or freezing them, there are fewer and fewer physicians who will want to participate in those programs."" In Texas, another major concern is how overhauling health care will deal with the question of providing treatment to illegal immigrants --- a significant slice of the patient population at JPS and other public hospitals. ""I've never met anyone in this area that is lukewarm on this issue,"" Earley said. ""We have over 6,000 births last year, and over 70 percent of them were to an undocumented population. That is a population we have to take care of."" As for Rose, he said he's optimistic but also waiting to learn from doctors whether he needs to consider a bone marrow transplant. ""The bone marrow testing alone costs $300,000,"" Rose told us. ""And we're not even talking about the hospital stays. That's just the testing part of it. At least that is what I am told."" In his apartment, he shows the eight prescription drug vials with his daily medications. In the window still hangs an Obama-Biden campaign sign. Ask about the politics of health care in Washington, and Rose's first reflex is to blame Republicans. But as the conversation continues, he voices frustration at all the recent Democratic infighting over how to pay for the overhaul. ""I think they need to get their heads together,"" Rose said. ""Because it's really not just about Republican vs. Democrat anymore, it's about getting the job done. And with those majorities in place, things should be happening, especially if you're coming from the same types of ideas and backgrounds, there shouldn't be too much opposition. ... And if they don't get it done, there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be hurting because of it.""","Texan Gregory Rose, who's uninsured, was diagnosed with leukemia at 23 .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- One person was killed and 57 were injured Thursday when hundreds of protesters clashed with security forces in Sulaimaniya, a city in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, according to Dr. Raykot Hamed Salih, a health official there. Salih had reported earlier in the day that nine people were killed, but he retracted that figure. He explained to CNN that in the middle of the chaos, the emergency hospital in Sulaimaniya received a number of unconscious individuals, and doctors mistakenly thought they were dead. Dozens of protesters attacked the Kurdistan Democratic Party headquarters in the city and destroyed furniture and computers inside the building, police officials in Sulaimaniya told CNN. Witnesses told CNN that a number of Kurdish security forces, known as peshmerga, opened fire to disperse the protesters. The demonstrators were angry about corruption, the quality of basic services and unemployment, Salih said. Authorities imposed a full curfew, banning cars and pedestrians from moving around the city until 6 a.m., police said. The Kurdistan Democratic Party is headed by the Kurdistan region's president, Massoud Barzani, an important power broker in the region. Iraq, like many of its neighbors, has been convulsed by popular protests since demonstrations toppled the leader of Tunisia last month. A least one person was shot dead and 55 others -- including four police -- were wounded Wednesday when private security guards and Iraqi security forces fired on hundreds of demonstrators outside the governor's office in the eastern city of Kut, health officials said. Police officials in Kut, about 65 miles (110 kilometers) south of Baghdad, tell CNN that nearly 2,000 demonstrators demanded the resignation of Wasit's provincial governor, Latif Hamed, accusing him of corruption. Some of the protesters tried to force their way inside the governor's office, prompting private security guards to shoot at them, police said. With the shooting, the situation escalated rapidly and the protesters became angrier, Kut police said. Dozens of protesters stormed the governor's office again and destroyed furniture inside, then set the building on fire. Another group of demonstrators went to the governor's house and set it ablaze. Kut police tell CNN that Hamed was not in the city when protesters attacked his office and home. The protesters were heard shouting, ""Down with (Prime Minister Nuri) al-Maliki, down with the corruption, down with thieves."" Others were carrying a banner that said, ""Eight years of suffering, where are your promises?"" referring to the Iraqi government that took power after Saddam Hussein's regime fell in 2003. In Falluja, hundreds of protesters walked toward the city council building and the mayor's office on Tuesday, demanding the resignation of the mayor and the head of the city council because of corruption and their inability to provide basic services to the people. For the first time since the demonstrations started across the country more than two weeks ago, Iraqiya state TV broadcast video of the Kut demonstration and urged people to protest peacefully and not to turn to violence.","Protesters attack the offices of an important regional party, police say .

"(CNN) -- Efren Peñaflorida, the 2009 CNN Hero of the Year, had a run-in with a pickpocket at a Manila airport on Thursday, but walked away unharmed and ready to laugh off the encounter. CNN honored Peñaflorida in November for starting a ""pushcart classroom"" in the Philippines to bring education to poor children as an alternative to gang membership. He was returning to Manila from Hong Kong, where he gave a speech, when a man dressed as a woman tried to grab something out of his bag at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport, police said. Police spotted the pickpocket and made an arrest, as a CNN crew witnessed the incident. The suspect, who police say was part of a larger pickpocketing operation, later confessed, authorities said. Peñaflorida kept his stride, ready to laugh off the incident, said CNN producer Alex Zolbert. The hero then headed to a rally in Manila, held in honor of his activism.","CNN Hero of the Year Efren Peñaflorida targeted by pickpocket at Manila airport .

"Editor's note: Joseph E. Stiglitz, professor at Columbia University, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001 for his work on the economics of information. Stiglitz was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration before joining the World Bank as chief economist. Economist Joseph E. Stiglitz says the strategy followed by the architects of the bank bailout was flawed. (CNN) -- America's recession is moving into its second year, with the situation only worsening. The hope that President Obama will be able to get us out of the mess is tempered by the reality that throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at the banks has failed to restore them to health, or even to resuscitate the flow of lending. Every day brings further evidence that the losses are greater than had been expected and more and more money will be required. The question is at last being raised: Perhaps the entire strategy is flawed? Perhaps what is needed is a fundamental rethinking. The Paulson-Bernanke-Geithner strategy was based on the realization that maintaining the flow of credit was essential for the economy. But it was also based on a failure to grasp some of the fundamental changes in our financial sector since the Great Depression, and even in the last two decades. For a while, there was hope that simply lowering interest rates enough, flooding the economy with money, would suffice; but three quarters of a century ago, Keynes explained why, in a downturn such as this, monetary policy is likely to be ineffective. It is like pushing on a string. Then there was the hope that if the government stood ready to help the banks with enough money -- and enough was a lot -- confidence would be restored, and with the restoration of confidence, asset prices would increase and lending would be restored. Remarkably, Bush administration Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and company simply didn't understand that the banks had made bad loans and engaged in reckless gambling. There had been a bubble, and the bubble had broken. No amount of talking would change these realities. It soon became clear that just saying that we were ready to spend the money would not suffice. We actually had to get it into the banks. The question was how. At first, the architects of the bailout argued (with complete and utter confidence) that the best way to do this was buying the toxic assets (those in the financial market didn't like the pejorative term, so they used the term ""troubled assets"") -- the assets that no one in the private sector would touch with a 10-foot pole. It should have been obvious that this could not be done in a quick way; it took a few weeks for this crushing reality to dawn on them. Besides, there was a fundamental problem: how to value the assets. And if we valued them correctly, it was clear that there would still be a big hole in banks' balance sheets, impeding their ability to lend. Then came the idea of equity injection, without strings, so that as we poured money into the banks, they poured out money, to their executives in the form of bonuses, to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Some of what they had left over they used to buy other banks -- to pursue strategic goals for which they could not have found private finance. The last thing in their mind was to restart lending. The underlying problem is simple: Even in the heyday of finance, there was a huge gap between private rewards and social returns. The bank managers have taken home huge paychecks, even though, over the past five years, the net profits of many of the banks have (in total) been negative. And the social returns have even been less -- the financial sector is supposed to allocate capital and manage risk, and it did neither well. Our economy is paying the price for these failures -- to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. But this ever-present problem has now grown worse. In effect, the American taxpayers are the major provider of finance to the banks. In some cases, the value of our equity injection, guarantees, and other forms of assistance dwarf the value of the ""private"" sector's equity contribution; yet we have no voice in how the banks are run. This helps us understand the reason why banks have not started to lend again. Put yourself in the position of a bank manager, trying to get through this mess. At this juncture, in spite of the massive government cash injections, he sees his equity dwindling. The banks -- who prided themselves on being risk managers -- finally, and a little too late -- seem to have recognized the risk that they have taken on in the past five years. Leverage, or borrowing, gives big returns when things are going well, but when things turn sour, it is a recipe for disaster. It was not unusual for investment banks to ""leverage"" themselves by borrowing amounts equal to 25 or 30 times their equity. At ""just"" 25 to 1 leverage, a 4 percent fall in the price of assets wipes out a bank's net worth -- and we have seen far more precipitous falls in asset prices. Putting another $20 billion in a bank with $2 trillion of assets will be wiped out with just a 1 percent fall in asset prices. What's the point? It seems that some of our government officials have finally gotten around to doing some of this elementary arithmetic. So they have come up with another strategy: We'll ""insure"" the banks, i.e., take the downside risk off of them. The problem is similar to that confronting the original ""cash for trash"" initiative: How do we determine the right price for the insurance? And almost surely, if we charge the right price, these institutions are bankrupt. They will need massive equity injections and insurance. There is a slight variant version of this, much like the original Paulson proposal: Buy the bad assets, but this time, not on a one by one basis, but in large bundles. Again, the problem is -- how do we value the bundles of toxic waste we take off the banks? The suspicion is that the banks have a simple answer: Don't worry about the details. Just give us a big wad of cash. This variant adds another twist of the kind of financial alchemy that got the country into the mess. Somehow, there is a notion that by moving the assets around, putting the bad assets in an aggregator bank run by the government, things will get better. Is the rationale that the government is better at disposing of garbage, while the private sector is better at making loans? The record of our financial system in assessing credit worthiness -- evidenced not just by this bailout, but by the repeated bailouts over the past 25 years -- provides little convincing evidence. But even were we to do all this -- with uncertain risks to our future national debt -- there is still no assurance of a resumption of lending. For the reality is we are in a recession, and risks are high in a recession. Having been burned once, many bankers are staying away from the fire. Besides, many of the problems that afflict the financial sector are more pervasive. General Motors and GE both got into the finance business, and both showed that banks had no monopoly on bad risk management. Many a bank may decide that the better strategy is a conservative one: Hoard one's cash, wait until things settle down, hope that you are among the few surviving banks and then start lending. Of course, if all the banks reason so, the recession will be longer and deeper than it otherwise would be. What's the alternative? Sweden (and several other countries) have shown that there is an alternative -- the government takes over those banks that cannot assemble enough capital through private sources to survive without government assistance. It is standard practice to shut down banks failing to meet basic requirements on capital, but we almost certainly have been too gentle in enforcing these requirements. (There has been too little transparency in this and every other aspect of government intervention in the financial system.) To be sure, shareholders and bondholders will lose out, but their gains under the current regime come at the expense of taxpayers. In the good years, they were rewarded for their risk taking. Ownership cannot be a one-sided bet. Of course, most of the employees will remain, and even much of the management. What then is the difference? The difference is that now, the incentives of the banks can be aligned better with those of the country. And it is in the national interest that prudent lending be restarted. There are several other marked advantages. One of the problems today is that the banks potentially owe large amounts to each other (through complicated derivatives). With government owning many of the banks, sorting through those obligations (""netting them out,"" in the jargon) will be far easier. Inevitably, American taxpayers are going to pick up much of the tab for the banks' failures. The question facing us is, to what extent do we participate in the upside return? Eventually, America's economy will recover. Eventually, our financial sector will be functioning -- and profitable -- once again, though hopefully, it will focus its attention more on doing what it is supposed to do. When things turn around, we can once again privatize the now-failed banks, and the returns we get can help write down the massive increase in the national debt that has been brought upon us by our financial markets. We are moving in unchartered waters. No one can be sure what will work. But long-standing economic principles can help guide us. Incentives matter. The long-run fiscal position of the U.S. matters. And it is important to restart prudent lending as fast as possible. Most of the ways currently being discussed for squaring this circle fail to do so. There is an alternative. We should begin to consider it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joseph E. Stiglitz.","Joseph E.

"TUOL SLENG, Cambodia (CNN)  -- Kaing Guek Eav is an elderly former math teacher and a born-again Christian. It's thought 15,000 men, women and children died after being shackled to iron beds and tortured in Tuol Sleng. He is also -- prosecutors contend -- a former prison chief with Cambodia's Khmer Rouge movement who oversaw the torture and killing of more than 15,000 men, women and children three decades ago. The trial of the 66-year-old man, better known as Duch, began Monday in front of a U.N.-backed tribunal just outside the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. Duch faces charges that include crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture and murder.  Watch Duch in the dock » . Spectators, many of them survivors of the abuse, watched the start of the trial from an auditorium separated from the courtroom by a large glass window. While he has admitted his role in the Khmer Rouge's genocidal reign, Duch won't be spared weeks of evidence, much expected to be shocking. Watch more on the evidence to be presented » . The prison he headed was a converted school, Tuol Sleng, that the regime renamed S-21. Here, men, women and children were shackled to iron beds and tortured -- before they were electrocuted, beaten and whipped to death, prosecutors said. Prisoners were meticulously photographed before they were killed.  See inside the prison and hear of its bloody past » . ""It all seems so fresh,"" said Norng Champhal, who was a starving little boy when invading Vietnamese forces entered the prison. He had been separated from his mother after one night in the prison and never saw her again. ""It's hard to control my feelings when I see this,"" he said, as he watched footage of the prison taken 30 years ago. ""I wonder whether my parents were tortured like these people,"" he said. The Khmer Rouge swept to power in 1975. Three years, eight months and 20 days later, at least 1.7 million people -- nearly one-quarter of Cambodia's population -- were dead from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. The organization has been at the forefront of recording the atrocities committed during the Khmer Rouge regime. Pol Pot and his followers envisioned a return to a nation of noble peasant farmers and sought to purge city dwellers, the rich, the religious, the educated, anyone from a different ethnic group. Tuol Sleng was one of 189 similar institutions across Cambodia. Duch is the first former Khmer Rouge leader to stand trial. The tribunal, which is made up of Cambodian and international judges, does not have the power to impose the death penalty. If convicted, Duch faces from five years to life in prison. The trial is expected to last three or four months. ""Probably the most important thing about this court is: even after 35 years, you are still not going to get away with it. That is the message,"" said Chief Prosecutor Robert Petit. When proceedings began last month, more than 500 people -- including three survivors from the prison Duch ran -- filled the tribunal. About 50 people came from Kampong Thom province, the birthplace of now-dead Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot. ""I couldn't sleep last night. I was dreaming about my time at S-21,"" Vann Nath, one of the few survivors of the prison run by Duch, told The Phnom Penh Post last month. Even though Duch was not a senior leader with the movement, many Cambodians were relieved that one of the regime's former leaders was facing justice, said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia. ""I think there is a feeling of, well you know, finally -- now it's finally happening after all these years of waiting -- hearing, fighting, negotiating,"" he told CNN last month. ""People have that kind of sense of relief that it's now moving. When I ask people around the center today, people say, 'Oh, it's about time.'"" Four of the regime's former leaders, also accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, await trial before the tribunal. Pol Pot died in 1998. CNN's Dan Rivers and Miranda Leitsinger contributed to this report.","Prosecutors say Duch oversaw the torture and killing of more than 15,000 people .

"(CNN) -- Accolades for the good Samaritan who rescued an abducted girl continued to roll in Thursday as California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called Victor Perez a ""true action hero."" The city of Fresno proclaimed the day ""Victor Perez Day"" and sponsored the visit from Schwarzenegger, who said the abduction of the girl, 8, ""had a great and heroic end."" Early Tuesday, Perez, 29, chased after a vehicle carrying the girl, who had been sexually assaulted hours earlier. ""Thank you for stepping in and never even thinking twice,"" Mayor Ashley Swearengin told Perez, a father of two boys. Perez has been on a whirlwind of more than a dozen television appearances. Wednesday he had the opportunity to meet with the girl's mother. ""I never thought there would be someone with such a big heart to rescue my daughter and risk your life,"" CNN affiliate KFSN quoted her as saying. An unemployed construction carpenter, Perez has been recently cutting wine grapes, earning minimum wage. The governor called for an employer to hire him. Perez said he is happy the girl and mother are back together. Around 6:45 a.m. Tuesday, Perez was outside his house talking with his cousin about the abduction when they saw a vehicle matching the suspect vehicle's description: an older-model, reddish-brown Chevrolet with a white stripe on the side. ""I thought, that could be the truck,"" Perez told CNN. That's when he sprang into action. He jumped into his 1988 white Ford pickup and followed the vehicle, cutting in four times before he eventually forced it to a stop. Immediately after the truck stopped, he saw that the girl was out. Perez said he believes the driver pushed her out. ""I was beyond scared,"" he said. The chase had taken him about a mile from his house and into another neighborhood. He yelled for residents to get the girl a blanket. About 40 minutes later, police caught up with the truck, then parked, and arrested Gregorio Gonzalez, 24, of Fresno. Charges against him will include kidnapping, false imprisonment and sexual assault, Police Chief Jerry Dyer said. The suspect was not armed.","California governor honors Victor Perez .

"(CNN) -- A man whose financial management business is under investigation faked a life-or-death emergency in his private aircraft before secretly parachuting out and letting his plane crash in the Florida panhandle, authorities said Monday. Marcus Schrenker exited his small plane before it crashed, and investigators are looking for him, police say. The pilot, identified as Marcus Schrenker, 38, later checked into a hotel in Alabama under a fake name and then put on a black cap and fled into woods, authorities in Alabama said, according to the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office in Milton, Florida. Authorities are searching for Schrenker. The manager of the airport in Indiana from which the six-seat Piper PA-46 took off Sunday said that no one else was on board at takeoff. The plane crashed Sunday night in a swampy, wooded area within 50 to 75 yards of some homes in East Milton, Florida, the sheriff's office said.  Watch more on the mysterious flight » . An Indiana judge on Monday froze Schrenker's assets at the request of investigators looking into his business dealings, said Jim Gavin, spokesman for the Indiana secretary of state. Public documents list Schrenker as president of an Indianapolis agency called Heritage Wealth Management. Records also show Heritage Insurance Services at the same address. The address is listed in the telephone directory as the site of Icon Wealth Management. Those three companies are under investigation for possible securities violations, according to Gavin. A search warrant was served in connection with that investigation December 31. The judge's asset-freezing order, which applies to Schrenker's wife and his three companies, is aimed at protecting investors, Gavin said. CNN's attempts to reach a representative for Schrenker were unsuccessful. The phone number for his business was disconnected, and public records do not list his home phone number. Schrenker ""appears to have intentionally abandoned the plane after putting it on autopilot over the Birmingham, Alabama, area and parachuting to the ground"" Sunday night, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The plane crashed at 9:15 p.m. CT on Sunday in a swampy area of the Blackwater River in East Milton, authorities said. It's unclear what time Schrenker made the earlier distress call. He told air traffic controllers that the window of his plane had imploded and he was bleeding profusely. That call came in when the aircraft was about 35 miles southwest of Birmingham. Controllers tried to tell the pilot to divert the flight to Pell City, Alabama, but he did not respond. The plane appeared to have been put on autopilot around 2,000 feet altitude, said Sgt. Scott Haines, a spokesman for the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office. The plane had been scheduled to land in Destin, Florida, authorities said. After the call came in, military aircraft were dispatched to intercept the plane. The jets spotted the Piper and deployed flares to illuminate the plane as it was flying and noticed that its door was open and the cockpit was dark, according to the Santa Rosa authorities. The jets continued to follow the plane until it crashed. Rescuers searched the area where the plane went down and began a search for the pilot. Meanwhile, Schrenker reportedly was more than 220 miles north of the crash site. The Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office got a call at 2:26 a.m. Monday from the Childersburg Police Department in Alabama saying that a white male, identified as Schrenker by his Indiana driver's license, approached a Childersburg officer at a store. Schrenker, who was wet from the knees down and had no injuries, told the officer that he had been in a canoeing accident with friends, the Santa Rosa Sheriff's Office said in a news release. Schrenker had goggles that looked like they were made for ""flying,"" according to the release. The Childersburg police didn't know about the plane crash, so they took Schrenker to a nearby hotel, authorities said. When police found out about the crash, they went back to the hotel and entered Schrenker's room. He was not there, they said. According to Santa Rosa authorities, Schrenker had checked in under a fake name, paid for his room in cash and ""put on a black toboggan cap and ran into the woods located next to the hotel."" CNN affiliate WVTM obtained surveillance video from the Harpersville Motel that WVTM says shows Schrenker checking in. It also shows Schrenker putting on a black cap and leaving, the station reported. Harpersville is 30 minutes east of Birmingham, and about 223 miles north of Milton, Florida, near where the wrecked plane was found. iReport.com: Are you near the crash scene? Tell us what you've seen . Federal investigators were helping in the probe. ""The FBI is looking into the matter, along with other agencies,"" said Paul Draymond with the Birmingham, Alabama, FBI office. Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said a ""detailed review of radar data"" and the fact that the plane had switched to autopilot suggested the pilot might have parachuted. The corporate plane does not have an ejection feature, said Steve Darlington, the airport manager of the Anderson Municipal Airport in Anderson, Indiana. Darlington described the pilot as ""accomplished"" and said he owns ""a couple of airplanes"" and flies regularly.","NEW: Indiana judge freeze's pilot's assets at investigators' request .

"(CNN) -- The pilot of a plane that crashed last month in Montana twice requested a change of destination in radio comments to air traffic controllers but ""gave no reason for the diversion,"" according to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board issued Thursday. A witness in Butte, Montana, took this photo shortly after the plane crash on March 22. Fourteen people were killed when the plane slammed into a cemetery March 22 in Butte, and investigators immediately began focusing on why the pilot asked to divert the flight from Bozeman, Montana, to Butte, 80 miles to the west. The report said the single engine-Pilatus PC-12/45 was carrying people to a ski vacation. The plane originally departed Redlands, California, for Nut Tree Airport in Vacaville, California, where passengers were picked up. It then went to Oroville, California, to pick up more passengers. The pilot left Oroville at 12:10 p.m. local time, with Bozeman as the destination and Butte as the alternate, according to an instrument flight rules flight plan the pilot filed. The pilot requested to divert to Butte at 2:03 p.m. and ""was cleared at pilot's discretion to descend to 14,000 feet."" The pilot two minutes later again requested to divert to Butte. The report said that at 2:27 p.m., controllers asked the pilot whether he had the airport in sight and ""the pilot indicated he had one more cloud to maneuver around."" A minute later, the pilot reported the airport in sight and controllers ""terminated radar service."" At 2:29 p.m., air traffic control ""called the aircraft in the blind with no response,"" and the accident was reported four minutes later. The aircraft slammed into a cemetery about 500 feet short of the Butte airport. ""Initial reports from ground witnesses indicate that the airplane was flying approximately 300 feet above ground level in a north-northwesterly direction. Shortly thereafter, the airplane's nose pitched to a nose-low attitude and it impacted the ground. One witness with aviation experience reported that the airplane was west of the runway centerline and appeared too high to land on the runway,"" the report said. ""The witness then saw the airplane bank to the left and fly farther west when it rolled, pitched down and descended out of his view. Although there is no air traffic control tower at Butte, the local fixed base operator lineman was monitoring the radio as the airplane approached the airport. He heard the pilot transmit that he would be landing on runway 33."" Investigators also were looking into whether the single-engine plane was overloaded and what role weather may have played in the accident. The preliminary NTSB report said ""visual meteorological conditions prevailed"" at both Bozeman and Butte.","Preliminary report sheds light on crash that killed 14 people in Butte, Montana .

"(CNN) -- A voluntary recall of eggs because of salmonella fears reached 380 million eggs Wednesday, the Egg Safety Center said. Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, which announced an earlier recall last week, added several more batches and brands to the recall Wednesday afternoon. ""Wright County Egg is fully cooperating with FDA's investigation by undertaking this voluntary recall,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our primary concern is keeping salmonella out of the food supply and away from consumers. As a precautionary measure, Wright County Egg also has decided to divert its existing inventory of shell eggs from the recalled plants to a breaker, where they will be pasteurized to kill any salmonella bacteria present."" After an uptick in salmonella infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration traced the source and determined it was most likely eggs from Wright County Egg. The company says it is working to determine how the shell eggs are being contaminated. The new recall covers eggs branded as Albertsons, Farm Fresh, James Farms, Glenview, Mountain Dairy, Ralphs, Boomsma, Lund, Kemps and Pacific Coast and are marked with a three-digit code ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers 1720 and 1942, the company said. The earlier recall covered the Lucerne, Albertsons, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma's, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch Farms and Kemps brands and are marked with a three-digit code ranging from 136 to 225 and plant numbers 1026, 1413 and 1946. The plant number beings with ""P - "" and is followed by the three-digit code. Both recalls affect eggs packed in several different sized cartons, from a half-dozen to 18-eggs. Only shell eggs are affected by the recall, the company said. Consumers are encouraged to return the eggs in their original packaging to where they were purchased for a full refund. Salmonella bacteria can be found inside and outside of eggs that appear to be normal.","Recall adds to recall announced last week .

"(CNN) -- The one really big question hanging over President Obama's weekend vacation to Panama City, Florida, now has an answer. Will he or won't he dive into the water to send a message that the Gulf Coast is back? The answer: He will, and sooner than expected. ""I think we're going to go tomorrow and as I just said Ed, I'm not going to let you guys take a picture of me with my shirt off,"" Obama jokingly told CNN Saturday. ""You guys will tease me just like last time. I was on the front page ... People commenting."" But just hours later, a photo was published on the White House Flickr page showing a smiling President Obama and his daughter Sasha taking a dip in the Gulf waters off Alligator Point in Panama City Beach, Florida. No reporters or press cameras were present for the swim, but the image will nonetheless send a message that the White House has sought to convey with the first family's trip: the Gulf Coast is open for business. Obama caused a bit of a tabloid stir when he took off his shirt to reveal a muscular physique during trips to Hawaii during the 2008 presidential campaign and subsequent presidential transition. But some are less concerned about Obama ending up on magazine covers, and more worried about the White House sending the right message. ""Absolutely, I want him to take his shirt off and get in the water and show it's clean and safe,"" said Stephen Leatherman, a professor at Florida International University in Miami who puts together an annual list of America's best beaches. Leatherman rates the beach there as one of the top 10 in the country, and he said Obama has a unique opportunity to showcase the fact that the Gulf Coast is still open for business despite the worst oil spill in American history. ""It's got lily-white sand, and frankly the oil didn't really make it there. It was pretty well spared,"" said Leatherman, who noted that the water is 87 or 88 degrees because of the steamy Florida weather, making it conducive to at least a quick presidential plunge. ""There is no better symbol than the president of the United States showing us the way,"" Leatherman said. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was cagey Friday when reporters asked whether the president will take a swim during the first family's 27-hour mini-vacation. ""Stay tuned,"" said Gibbs, who grew slightly impatient and a bit bemused about getting so many queries about something as seemingly minor as a presidential swim. ""Look, he's going to have some fun,"" Gibbs said. ""Whether or not he gets in the water is up for clearly some debate. But, look, he will have an opportunity to enjoy ... the physical beauty of the Gulf and do some work at the same time."" Gibbs turned it around on reporters and wondered whether they would bare their midriffs this weekend. ""Are you bringing your suits?"" Gibbs said with a smile. But Leatherman suggested it's no joking matter because the president's decision to swim or not to swim will carry tremendous symbolic weight. ""I think it's very important that he gets into the water because I think there's this feeling that if you get in, you're going to get contaminated or get all kinds of diseases,"" he said. This is the president's fifth trip to the Gulf region since the April 20 explosion that sparked the oil disaster. The trip is generating criticism over whether Obama is giving the region short shrift by spending only parts of Saturday and Sunday in Panama City. White House officials announced the trip earlier this summer after critics wondered why the president and first lady had urged Americans to vacation in the Gulf but originally chose Bar Harbor, Maine, and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, as the only locations for their own sojourns. Now, the criticism has shifted to whether 27 hours in Panama City is too quick of a jaunt, and the Republican National Committee released a statement Friday that also said Obama has included Florida in only a couple of his trips to the region in recent months. ""It's nice to see the president take the time out of his busy schedule of golf games and campaign fundraisers to clear his conscience and visit Florida for only the second time since the oil crisis began,"" RNC spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg said. ""As he meets with business owners in the Panhandle, it seems like the perfect opportunity for him to explain how his reckless spending, tax increases, and government takeover of health care are supposed to help the Gulf's devastated economy. Not even the Sunshine State can put a positive light on the president's failed liberal policies that have sunk his approval ratings to an all-time low."" The president is accompanied by first lady Michelle Obama and their younger daughter Sasha. (The oldest, Malia, is still away at camp and will not be in Florida). Also making the trip is Gulf Coast recovery chief, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, to try to show the administration is committed to a long-term turnaround. Gibbs largely deflected questions about whether the trip was too short, saying the president is focused on promoting the ""health of the region"" with the vacation. ""Tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast is the economy,"" Gibbs told reporters Friday. ""This is an opportunity to highlight the notion that this important region of the country is still doing well and open for business."" While Leatherman said he does think the trip seems too short, Obama should be applauded for carving out some time to help the region. ""I think it's basically a photo-op, isn't it?"" said Leatherman. ""But I still think it's a good thing for the president to come down and show the world that it's clean and safe. That will go a long way to helping the Gulf Coast."" Leatherman added: ""The best thing that could happen is the president saying, 'I'm going in!' And I don't mean damn the torpedoes. I mean him saying, 'It's clean and safe, and I'm going in the water!' ""","NEW: President Obama and daughter Sasha took a swim in the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- As the battle surrounding Casey Kasem brought his relatives into the courtroom again Friday, the iconic radio host's health is declining, and his family is preparing to say goodbye. Kasem ""won't be with us much longer,"" said Danny Deraney, the rep for the ""American Top 40"" host's daughter, Kerri Kasem. His family is gathering at St. Anthony Hospital in Washington, where the ailing 82-year-old was in critical condition as of Thursday, according to the hospital. His son, Mike Kasem, traveled from Singapore to be with his father, and Kasem's brother flew in from Detroit. Kasem suffers from Lewy body dementia, which has no cure. Kasem's children from his first marriage hope the family will look past their dispute during his last moments. They want him to be surrounded by loved ones, including their stepmother and half-sister, Jean and Liberty Kasem. ""If he opens his eyes, I want my dad just once to see everyone standing around him, putting our differences aside and let him know how much he is loved by everyone, including Jean and Liberty,"" Kerri Kasem said in a statement. Deraney said the Kitsap County Superior Court recognized a previous California court order that gave Kerri Kasem full health conservatorship over her father. During the hearing Friday, the court also found Casey Kasem's wife, Jean Kasem, in contempt, but did not penalize her with a fine, Deraney said. He added that Jean Kasem was granted a private family moment for more than two hours with her husband of 34-years. Attorneys for Jean Kasem said the judge's findings and order will be prepared and circulated for signature next week. Jean Kasem presented her side of the story in a declaration filed at the Kitsap County Superior Court on Wednesday, which was obtained by CNN. It includes documentation that the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office had no concern for her husband's well-being in her care, and supporting declarations from the family friends the Kasems were visiting in Washington. The declaration also claims that Kerri Kasem owes $1.3 million to Casey and Jean Kasem after accepting various financial gifts from her father since she turned 18. Jean Kasem further alleges that Kerri Kasem is a Scientologist, citing an unverified celebrity website, and includes an article about the FBI investigating the Church of Scientology for human trafficking. Deraney denies that Kerri Kasem has ever been a Scientologist, adding, ""She loves studying religions. Jean picked out the most controversial one to distract from what's really going on."" In light of the ongoing family feud, a court order signed by a Kitsap County judge on Thursday dictated that visits to Casey Kasem would be equally shared by both sides of the family, and that during his final hours everyone would be permitted to visit him at the same time. Kasem's daughter, Julie Kasem, also said she hoped for peace during her father's final moments. ""My dad taught us that family comes first. We want to honor him and make sure all of his family, including Jean and Liberty, are surrounding him with love at this critical time,"" she said in a statement.

"(TIME.com) -- President William Howard Taft has the dubious honor of being America's heaviest leader, weighing in at 314 pounds during his tenure in the White House. Concerned about how his weight would affect his health, and therefore his ability to serve, in December 1905, the soon-to-be president wrote to English physician and diet expert Nathaniel E. Yorke-Davies for advice. At the time, there was little appreciation for how potentially harmful excessive weight could be, and doctors like Yorke-Davies were just beginning to link symptoms like poor sleep and heartburn to obesity, and to advise their more corpulent patients about the importance of slimming down. Taft was apparently uncomfortable with the symptoms of restless sleep and indigestion that resulted from his girth, and hired Yorke-Davies to create a weight loss plan, writing that ""no real gentleman weighs more than 300 pounds."" Taft and Yorke-Davies exchanged letters over 10 years, with the president providing intimate details of what he ate, how often he exercised, and even how frequently he had bowel movements. Deborah Levine, a professor in the department of health policy and management at Providence College, analyzed the contents of this correspondence to better understand how contemporary recommendations about obesity have evolved. What's striking about her report, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, is how stubbornly unchanged the best advice about controlling obesity remains from Taft's time in the White House, from 1909 to 1913, to the present day. TIME.com: Menu makeover -- is fast food finally changing? Yorke-Davies recommended that Taft try the following diet: . 8 a.m. A tumbler of hot water with lemon, sipped slowly. 9 a.m. Breakfast: unsweetened tea or coffee, ""two or three Gluten biscuits,"" and 6 ounces of lean grilled meat. 12:30 p.m. Lunch: 4 ounces of lean meat, 4 ounces of cooked green vegetables without butter, 3 ounces of baked or stewed unsweetened fruit, 1 gluten biscuit, and 1 of the recommended ""sugarless"" wines. Afternoon cup of tea, coffee, or beef tea without milk or sugar advised. 7-8 p.m., Dinner: clear soup, 4 ounces of fish, 5 ounces of meat, 8 ounces of vegetables, and 4 ounces of stewed fruit. Plain salad and 2 gluten biscuits, if desired. A list of vegetables and condiments were recommended for variation. How does this regimen compare to today's weight loss programs? Dr. Eric Rimm, an associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, thought the diet would have been quite a challenge for Taft, and recognized many good intentions but little in the way of motivational support for the struggling president. Rimm notes that doctors have since learned more about how to help heavier patients to apply the same principles to achieve more lasting success in shedding pounds. Mix it up . During the correspondence, Taft lost 60 pounds, but it took time, and at one point he actually gained 19 pounds back. ""Willpower can only last so long, even if you're the president of the United States,"" says Rimm. ""He just got fed up with it and thought it was boring and gained all the weight back and more. That's the classic problem we still see today."" Rimm says Taft's diet looks pretty unappealing, and being forced to follow such a strict schedule every day can quickly lose its flair. ""I don't know what it was like to be alive in 1905, but it looks like it's very food-focused and not flavor-focused,"" he says. ""If you have will power and you follow this diet, it works. He was eating this every day and it was working for him. His friends were telling him he looked good, and it was going great, but he said he was hungry all the time."" The current U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines recommend a variety of foods that both fulfill our daily nutritional needs and keeps people interested in eating and enjoying the food they eat every day. TIME.com: Weight loss apps -- don't waste your money . Don't be too strict, be realistic . Yorke-Davies gave Taft a list of allowed foods and a list of forbidden foods, which contemporary doctors know isn't the most effective way to encourage better eating habits. ""I don't think that's the healthiest way to approach eating a healthy diet. People treating themselves occasionally might be a good thing, and it keeps things in perspective,"" says Rimm. There are certainly foods that you should avoid, such as high fat red meats and sugared beverages, but being too strict can also backfire. People need to be realistic about whether they can restrict their diet, especially in social situations. Taft often complained that it was too hard for him to refuse foods at events like political dinners. ""Going on a diet and thinking you can do it in a vacuum is very hard,"" says Rimm. Sometimes you need to make exceptions, especially if your job demands it. Imagine if President Obama refused a meal during a meeting -- or if any politician refused the regional fare on an official visit. Being realistic about a diet means not cutting out any foods but eating a diversity of foods in moderation. TIME.com: When good celebrities promote bad foods . Eat breakfast . ""The one thing that was done right is that breakfast was included. People choose to skip breakfast to save on calories but that doesn't tend to work in the long-term,"" says Rimm. Eat fruits and vegetables . Although Taft's veggies may not have been prepared with the same range of tastes and seasonings available today, produce was still an important part of his diet plan. Talk to someone . The most successful diet plans and diet programs usually involve some communication between the patient and either other dieters or health care personnel who support their weight loss efforts and help them to stay motivated and track their progress. For instance, Weight Watchers offers users both the ability to track their eating and exercise, as well as attend support groups to discuss victories and challenges. ""That seems to be something that helped Taft, and kept him from quitting sooner,"" says Rimm, of the weekly letters he wrote to Yorke-Davies. ""It's amazing to us in this day and age of instantaneous communication that there would be days between the correspondence between Taft and Yorke-Davies, but that was still enough."" You have to exercise . Yorke-Davies urged Taft to get some exercise every day, and Taft tried to comply, generally by going on a horse back ride. But given how much Taft continued to struggle with getting slimmer, he was likely still taking in more calories than he was burning off. TIME.com: Finding your fitness limit . ""Most diets don't work unless you do some sort of activity,"" says Rimm. Taft wasn't the only commander in chief to confront weight issues, but his revealing correspondence should be reassuring to anyone today who is trying to lose weight. There is no magic formula for shedding pounds; even presidents, it seems, have to watch what they eat and exercise regularly to avoid obesity.

"(CNN) -- In the weeks since an oil rig exploded and later sank into the Gulf of Mexico, President Obama has dealt with the tragedy with his signature cool, calm and collected approach. But with the oil still gushing in what is now the worst spill in U.S. history and the environmental devastation coming ashore, the president is becoming a target of the anger that was originally directed only at BP. ""One time, go off!"" director Spike Lee urged on CNN's ""AC 360°."" ""If there's any one time to go off, this is it, because this is a disaster."" Lee's sentiment echoes the frustration of people who want to see Obama get loud, take charge and inspire them like he did during his presidential run. Recalling then-candidate Obama's ability to rouse crowds into chants of ""Yes, we can,"" presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said, ""There was a feeling he was going to be one of these presidents that moved us with words the way John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan did in recent decades."" Instead, Obama has presented himself as the unflappable president, with the engineer-like approach of Jimmy Carter and the legislative astuteness of Lyndon Johnson, Brinkley said. ""But in a time of great crisis, people aren't looking for Johnson or Carter. They are looking for powerful rhetorical leadership -- words that move the country in a positive direction,"" he said. Gloria Borger: We got the president we elected . The president has visited the region twice since the oil spill, most recently the Friday before Memorial Day weekend. Obama brought the tragedy to a more personal level, telling the public that he grew up in a place where the ocean is sacred, so he understands the emotional connection -- but it was only a brief aside in an otherwise straightforward address. It was hardly the outpouring that came from Louisiana Democrat Charlie Melancon, who broke into tears last week at a Capitol Hill hearing about the oil spill. ""Our culture is threatened. Our coastal economy is threatened. And everything that I know and love is at risk,"" Melancon, who represents many of the affected Louisiana shoreline areas, told his Capitol Hill colleagues. Unable to finish reading his prepared statement, Melancon submitted it for the congressional record and then walked out of the hearing room as other lawmakers sought to comfort him. And it was hardly the advocacy that's come from Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, also of Louisiana. In a column on CNN.com, Ruben Navarrette wrote that due to Obama's lackluster response, ""Bobby has Barack on the ropes and he is coming across as more passionate and more presidential."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was pushed Tuesday to back up his claim that Obama is enraged by the situation. ""I've seen rage from him. I have,"" Gibbs said at the daily briefing. Asked to describe it, Gibbs pointed to the president's ""clenched jaw"" and his call to ""plug the damn hole."" The president has been actively engaged in the crisis -- firing the head of the Minerals Management Service, extending the moratorium on further offshore drilling and increasing the federal presence in the region. But instead of a galvanizing cry of outrage at the failed efforts to cap the undersea gusher, Obama's made the ""let's not panic"" appeal, Brinkley said. ""With each BP failure, I think the American people have wanted to feel that the president is not just in the saddle but is leading the charge, and he's fallen short in this regard,"" he said. Despite the pummeling he's received from pundits, it's not too late for Obama to take charge of the narrative, Brinkley said, suggesting that the White House set up a command center in the Gulf to provide a clearinghouse for ideas and that Obama take on a more integral part of the catastrophe by spending more time in the area, meeting with fishermen and locals instead of just dropping by. The White House has started to take a more aggressive approach, with Attorney General Eric Holder's announcement Tuesday that the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into the oil spill. The Obama administration also will no longer do joint briefings with BP on the spill, and instead will have former Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen handle the daily briefings on his own, senior administration officials told CNN on Tuesday. The change is an effort to control the message, release accurate information about the oil spill and speak in one voice to deliver the daily message on latest developments, officials said. Obama needs to build on the momentum with a primetime address and a heartfelt message to the American people, Brinkley said. ""There is a craving for a different kind of crisis leadership from President Obama largely because he's so capable of it as we saw on the campaign trail in 2008,"" he said. ""When he lets go and talks from the heart, he's one of the most effective political figures in modern times."" CNN's Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report.","Obama has been criticized for seeming disconnected from the tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico .

"London (CNN) -- Pakistani schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai added her voice Tuesday to calls for an end to female genital mutilation, a procedure affecting millions of women and girls worldwide. A global ""Girl Summit"" is aimed at eradicating the practice, as well as child, early and forced marriage, within a generation. It's being held in London, hosted by the UK government along with U.N. children's agency UNICEF. UNICEF estimates that at least 125 million women and girls around the world have been subjected to FGM, the ""partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."" As many as 30 million girls under the age of 15 may still be at risk, UNICEF says, although the practice appears to be declining. FGM is concentrated in 29 countries, mostly in Africa, according to the agency. Generally done without anesthetic, it ""can have lifelong health consequences including chronic infection, severe pain during urination, menstruation, sexual intercourse, and childbirth, and psychological trauma,"" campaign group Equality Now states on its website. ""No one knows how many girls die from FGM."" According to UNICEF, ""social acceptance"" is the most frequently cited reason for supporting the continuation of the practice. The summit -- the first of its kind and attended by representatives of governments, grass-roots organizations, campaigners and survivors from around the world -- aims to change people's ways of thinking. Malala said via Twitter: ""We should not be followers of traditions that go against human rights ... we are human beings and we make traditions."" Alimatu Dimonekene, who underwent the procedure at the age of 16 in Sierra Leone and now campaigns against FGM, told the summit that while she was cut, her daughters never would be. In a video produced ahead of the conference with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, a UK children's charity, she told of the day her life was changed forever. ""I was 16. It was a nice warm day, normal day. There was no idea it was going to happen,"" she said. A room was already prepared for what is known in Sierra Leone as ""the cutting,"" she said. A friend of her mother's sat on her chest to try to keep her quiet, Dimonekene said, as she struggled against others who were pulling off her clothes and underwear. ""She came in with a knife and little blades in her hands,"" Dimonekene said of the woman who carried out the procedure, who had been hired by her grandmother. ""And a cloth was put in my mouth so I couldn't scream."" She and a friend who was also cut were left alone in the room. ""For the next four days we were just crying, no one cleaned us up, we were still bleeding."" The pain was just getting worse but she was unable to tell anyone, Dimonekene said. ""Physically, emotionally, it affected me terribly."" Prime Minister David Cameron announced new UK government measures Tuesday to tackle the problem, a day after a major study revealed that an estimated 137,000 women are affected or at risk of FGM in England and Wales. The UK measures include legislation that will mean parents can be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughters being cut, as well as extra guidance for police and funding for support for survivors. ""I'll make reporting FGM mandatory for doctors, teachers and social workers. Let's end this abhorrent practice once and for all,"" Cameron said via Twitter. The new study, by City University London and campaign group Equality Now, is based on an examination of 2011 United Kingdom census data, in an effort to determine how many women and girls have moved to the country from places where the practice of mutilation is common. The last major report on the problem in England and Wales, in 2007, estimated that there were 66,000 women affected in the country and 24,000 at risk. The practice is illegal in the UK, but many girls are taken back to their parents' countries of origin for the procedure to be carried out. Experts tie the practice to specific ethnic groups rather than a particular religion or country and say there's a variety of justifications, including diminishing or controlling female sexual desire and ensuring a girl's ""marriageability.""

"(CNN) -- At first glance, it seems the graffiti revolution that descended on the Middle East in the wake of the Arab Spring has largely bypassed Dubai. The city's public transport -- usually an irresistible canvas for taggers -- remains remarkably glistening. The walls of the city's myriad new builds are unmarred by aerosol sketches. Head indoors, however, and you're likely to find a different story. Club nights often feature live graffiti demos by local artists; restaurants tap writers to mark up their walls; brands commission the city's street artists to emblazon their brand on a variety of spaces. ""Dubai is bonkers for it at the minute,"" says Sya One, a local street artist who, along with his wife Steffi Bow, has become the go-to writer for many local and global corporations. This summer, Adidas recruited the pair to collaborate in their Unite All Originals campaign. ""We get contacted to do projects all the time, though we've not once advertised,"" says Bow, who reasons that the trend is born out of Dubai's MTV-loving youth culture. The duo, who operate as The Graffiti Lovers, grew up tagging around London. They argue that the corporate slant of their work is necessitated both by their compulsion to do graffiti and Dubai's inhospitable street art environment. Dubai's Waste Management Department says the penalty is a fine, which doubles every time a perpetrator is caught. If a enough of a writer's tags are identified around the city, that could add up to a hefty sum. ""Dubai is so clean. When I first got here, graffiti was the first thing I wanted to do,"" admits One. ""But it's not worth doing anything illegal in Dubai, because it's not worth the hassle. You'd get away with it in the UK, but here, it's such a small scene, [the police] would soon find out who it was."" Though One says the restrictions of painting corporate murals ""does my head in,"" Bow thinks it has a positive side. ""It gives us a platform to show Dubai what graffiti is all about; it's not just vandalism,"" she says. Read more: The dangers Arab cartoonists face . In their free time, One and Bow work towards championing the city's legitimized graffiti scene. Bow offers workshops to school children, and the pair has set up a wall in their back yard, where local and visiting street artists are invited to scrawl whatever they like. Dubai's galleries have also started courting the world's street artists in hopes of lending Dubai a little extra color. Taksheel, a local arts organization, recently invited Barcelona graffiti writer Ruben Sanchez over as part of a one-year residency. Sanchez also says he'd rather work within Dubai's legal framework than incur the wrath of the authorities. ""Of course, I've had the temptation,"" he says. ""You need that rush."" Sanchez's Cubist-meets-Arabia murals have cropped up around the city, though he says he's sought approval from both the local government and individual property owners. ""The first time I asked for permission it felt weird,"" he admits. ""I never used to ask permission. I would just paint and maybe say sorry afterward."" While Sanchez doesn't object to the Graffiti Lovers' corporate approach, he maintains it's not for him. ""I understand why they do it -- artists have to pay the bills. I respect it, but personally, I just don't feel comfortable doing that kind of thing."" The handful of the city's unsanctioned street artists feel even more conflicted about corporate sponsorship of graffiti. ""I wish people would stop relying on brands and companies to sponsor their intentions, and just get out there and do their own thing independently, without any interference,"" says 8, aka Queen Sheba, an anonymous stencil artist whose work has started appearing in one of the city's residential neighborhoods. Sheba is one of a small handful of writers who make up Dubai's landscape without seeking permission first. Perhaps the city's most notable unsanctioned street artist, however, is Arcadia Blank, whose style is to drop socially pointed text on Dubai's temporary architecture. Read more: Sex, lies and lithographs: An Iranian epic for the masses . ""The price of Arab oil should never be dearer than the price of Arab blood,"" reads one of Blank's posters, while his scrawl on a piece of scaffolding in the midst of the city beseeches onlookers to, ""please colonize me gently."" Though Blank declined to comment, one can assume the use of temporary space is to avoid possibly messy legal repercussions. For the most part, his work has drawn positive feedback from many of the city's other artists. ""I really like his stuff,"" concedes Sanchez. ""He's been writing his pretty intense codes all over the city for years."" ""He is the street artist who has inspired me most,"" says Sheba. ""I have great respect for his work, which is very interesting to say the least.""","In Dubai, no product launch or 'it' opening is complete without a live graffiti demo.
Corporations are also clamoring to hire local street artists to give their brand 'edge'.
Fines for graffiti double every time a perpetrator is caught.
Many street artists operate either legally, or quasi-legally."
"New York (CNN) -- It has been more than two weeks since Superstorm Sandy hit the Northeast, yet many still remain without power. Two residents of New York's Long Island are going to court declaring, in effect, they've had enough. A lawsuit filed Tuesday by the two residents charges the area's main electricity providers -- Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) and its partner National Grid -- committed ""gross negligence, breach of contract, and fraud,"" according to attorney Ken Mollins, who is representing the plaintiffs. Although the suit, which does not seeks specific damages but calls on the court to award ""a sum to be determined at trial,"" was filed by two individuals, Mollins entered the claim as a class-action, which would allow other residents to join as plaintiffs. ""This has the potential to be the biggest class-action lawsuit ever with possibly 1 million individuals joining,"" Mollins said. Red Cross donations top $130 million for Sandy relief . As of Tuesday night over 13,000 customers still remained in the dark, according to LIPA's Storm Center. Mollins is seeking accountability from the utility companies and believes they did not properly prepare for Sandy. ""In the week before the storm they did nothing to prepare,"" said Mollins. ""They took no evasive action whatsoever."" In response to inquiries from CNN about the suit, LIPA spokesman Mark Gross said, ""At this time we are focusing on completing restoration for our customers."" National Grid, a multinational company based in the United Kingdom, responded with a statement saying its workers are focusing on completing restoration and that they ""continue to work with local officials and relief agencies to provide ongoing support to those communities and to be there for our customers."" CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan who has experience in class-action lawsuits, does not believe this will be an easy win for Long Island residents because they will have to prove that the utility companies were negligent in planning for the storm. Callan believes LIPA can easily state that the catastrophic event exceeded everybody's expectations. ""Ultimately, it's Mother Nature that bears the responsibility."" Volunteers feed the still-powerless after Sandy . Long Island residents, meanwhile, echo the plaintiffs' attorney in criticizing the power companies. ""LIPA had horrible, horrible communication,"" said Susan Parker, who was out of power for two full weeks. Parker, however, doesn't believe she will participate in the class-action lawsuit. ""I feel very lucky that all I lost was my power, I just keep thinking priorities and what some other people have lost,"" she said. Long Island resident Mitch Gerson also believes LIPA failed to appropriately communicate with customers. ""There's absolutely no question in my mind that LIPA did a terrible job."" Gerson said. He and his family were displaced from their home for over 12 days, he said, adding that the difficulties from that situation will be a factor in deciding whether he and his family will join the lawsuit. The lawsuit, which was filed in state court, came the same day that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bluntly criticized LIPA and called for its overhaul at a press conference. ""LIPA has been beyond repair for a long, long time,"" Cuomo said on Tuesday, ""I believe it needs to be overhauled and you need a new system."" In the midst of heavy criticism for the company, the chief operating officer of Long Island Power Authority, Mike Hervey, announced his resignation on Tuesday, effective at the end of 2012, according to a statement from LIPA.","More than 13,000 customers are still without power on Long Island, a utility says .

"(CNN) -- Two more goals from Lionel Messi, taking him to 50 goals in all competitions in a remarkable season, saw Barcelona win 2-0 at Racing Santander on Sunday to close the gap on Spanish leaders Real Madrid back to 10 points. Fresh from bagging an astonishing five goals in the 7-1 Champions League rout of Bayer Leverkusen in midweek, the Argentine maestro again proved the catalyst for another Barcelona win as the defending Spanish champions kept within range of Jose Mourinho's side, who beat Real Betis 3-2 on Saturday. Racing appointed Alvaro Cervera as their new coach last weekend in an attempt to arrest a slide that has seen them drop into the relegation zone after going eight matches without a victory. Messi hits record five in Barcelona rout . However, they always looked second best against a Barca side, who went ahead in the 29th minute when Messi slid home to score from close range after being set up by Cesc Fabregas on the right. And Fabregas also played a hand in the second goal -- the former Arsenal midfielder earning a 56th minute penalty after being fouled by Domingo Cisma, with Messi making no mistake from the spot. Barca wasted further chances to extend their advantage, but Messi missed a one-on-one opportunity for his hat-trick, while Juan Cuenca struck the post. Of his 50 goals this season, Messi has scored 30 in the Primera Liga, meaning he still trails Cristiano Ronaldo by two goals in the Spanish golden boot standings. Pep Guardiola's side are now a massive 24 points clear of third-placed Valencia, who squandered a two-goal lead before being held 2-2 by Real Mallorca. Valencia, who have won just one of their last four matches, went ahead through Tino Costa's deflected shot and doubled their advantage early in the second half when a mistake from Mallorca goalkeeper Dudu Aouate allowed Aritz Aduriz to score. But Emilio Nsue and Victor Casadesus turned things around for the visitors and Valencia ended the match with 10 men after Costa was dismissed for a two-footed challenge. Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid and Espanyol kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. Nigeria international Kalu Uche scored a hat-trick as Espanyol crushed Rayo Vallecano 5-1, while Atletico beat Granada 2-0. Atletico and Espanyol lie eighth and ninth in the table respectively, a point behind seventh-placed Athletico Bilbao -- who slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Osasuna. Bilbao failed to kick on from Thursday's impressive 3-2 Europa League victory at Manchester United. Osasuna took the lead when Ander Iturraspe headed a free-kick into his own goal after nine minutes and Raul Garcia doubled the lead before Spain striker Fernando Llorente pulled a goal back for the visitors.","Two more goals from Lionel Messi saw Barcelona defeat Racing Santander 2-0 .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- The police investigation into the killing of Reeva Steenkamp by Oscar Pistorius sounded like a catalog of bumbling, bad judgment, poor memory and petty theft in court on Friday, and it was the commanding officer on the scene the night of the killing who was testifying. Former police Col. G.S. van Rensburg was on the stand all day, first for the prosecution and then being cross-examined by the defense. He described finding a police ballistics expert handling Pistorius' gun without wearing gloves and reprimanding the officer, who apologized and put on gloves. And he said he was ""furious"" when at least one of the Olympic athlete's valuable wristwatches disappeared from his bedroom as police investigated the crime scene. He ""body searched"" his fellow officers, their bags and their vehicles but was unable to find the watch, which was worth several thousand dollars. He also said he had ordered the bathroom door through which Pistorius shot Steenkamp removed from the house, placed in a body bag and taken to his office, explaining, ""The door is the most valuable evidence because the deceased was behind the door."" Earlier in the week, the defense attacked police handling of the door, implying that the evidence was unreliable because it was contaminated. Van Rensburg resigned from the force in December after three decades, under fire for his handling of the door. Asked what he now did for a living, he choked up and said, ""I am now coaching sports, and sports is my life."" Golden boy turned defendant . He's the 13th witness to testify for the prosecution in the murder trial of Pistorius, once South Africa's golden boy for the stellar track success that made him the first double amputee runner to compete in the Olympics. The sprinter admits that he killed Steenkamp, his girlfriend of about four months, on Valentine's Day 2013 but says it was a terrible accident, not premeditated murder. He shot her through the locked bathroom door in his house, saying he thought she was an intruder, and then broke the door down with a cricket bat to get to her when he realized his mistake. She was 29. Pistorius, 27, is pleading not guilty to murder and three other weapons charges. On Friday, his lawyer Barry Roux ripped into van Rensburg's chronology of events on the night of the killing, presenting witness statements from three police officers whose accounts differed from van Rensburg's. The former officer was so startled by the statement of police Sgt. Ntome Sebetha that he stared at Roux and said, ""Amazing."" Later, Roux rattled van Rensburg so severely, pointing out clear differences between two pictures that the former officer said were the same, that van Rensburg refused to answer a question about how many keys were in another photograph. ""It's not a trick question,"" Roux said. ""There's one key there."" Gruesome images . The former police colonel first took the stand Thursday and said paramedics were there when he arrived at Pistorius' address about 3:55 a.m., but Steenkamp was dead. As he testified, the prosecution showed more than 100 police photographs taken at Pistorius' house after the killing, including the sprinter's 9 mm handgun, still cocked and ready to fire, on a bloody towel or bathmat on a blood-spattered floor. Both prosecution and defense accidentally displayed photos of Steenkamp's dead body and mortal wounds Thursday, prompting the man who killed her to be violently sick. Pistorius threw up after both defense and prosecution lawyers scrolled through evidence photos on monitors to find the ones they wanted to discuss, flashing past the gruesome images as they did so. There's a monitor directly in front of Pistorius as he sits in the stand, on trial for murder. On Friday, the court was shown a photo of a toilet covered in blood, but only van Rensburg saw photos of Steenkamp's body and closeups of her injuries. Those gruesome pictures were not displayed on courtroom monitors. Even so, Pistorius kept his head down, shielding his eyes with one hand, while prosecutor Gerrie Nel talked the former police officer quickly through the sheaf of photos on the witness stand. Air rifle, bat kept by bedroom door . On Thursday, the prosecution talked van Rensburg through police photographs of the athlete's house taken on that night. They showed some small spots of blood on chairs in the downstairs sitting room and a trail of blood that led upstairs. Pistorius appeared calm and took notes as the police photographs of the gun were shown. A black cell phone lay on the floor next to it. Another image showed a bloodstained towel in the bathroom, as well as a cricket bat and bullet cartridge on the bathroom floor, next to large bloodstains. The photos also indicated that Pistorius kept an air rifle and baseball bat by the bedroom door. Other police photos included one of a magazine with bullets and pouch taken from the right-hand bedside drawer and a closeup of the magazine with a hollow-point bullet, the kind that killed Steenkamp. Some of the photographs appeared consistent with Pistorius' version of events that night. One showed a fan by the right-hand side of the bed, which may gel with Pistorius' account that he went out to get the fan from the balcony before hearing noises he thought were made by an intruder. Gun at his bedside . The case against Pistorius is largely circumstantial, Nel said in his opening statement last week. Pistorius and Steenkamp were the only people in his house when he killed her. Nel has been building a picture of what happened through the testimony of experts, neighbors who heard screaming and bangs that night, current and former friends of Pistorius' and a security guard who sped to the scene because of reports of gunshots. Many prosecution witnesses' accounts are consistent with Pistorius' version of events: that he got up in the night, went out to his balcony to get a fan, came back inside and heard noises in the bathroom that he thought came from an intruder. He said he took the gun and fired while calling for Steenkamp to call police. When she didn't answer, he realized it could have been her in the bathroom, he said. Neighbors said they heard a woman screaming before the shots were fired. But the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was Steenkamp screaming in fear for her life was in fact Pistorius when he realized what he had done. Pistorius and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting, allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. The trial is expected to take at least another week.","Defense assails former officer's credibility as he testifies against Pistorius .

"(CNN) -- The C-Suite. Near mythical in status. The Valhalla you reach in corporate life when you've made it. So, how do you get there? The tried and tested route of hard work and influence gets you a long way certainly. Stellar performance gets you noticed. A powerful network, an influential sponsor can give you a turbo boost on your way up. But though they will take you far, when it comes to the C-Suite, what gets you here -- as they say -- won't take you there. So, what is the difference that makes the difference when it comes to getting to the top? In interviews with 268 senior executives, the Center for Talent Innovation researched what marked out their people as destined for the top. They isolated three key qualities for success in corporate life: gravitas, communication and appearance. Gravitas mattered most, with 67% of those surveyed naming it as the crucial quality. Gravitas marks you out as having what it takes to lead. And if you want to understand how gravitas works, and to harness it in your life, the best place to start is the ancient world. Gravitas is a Roman word which translates dignity, impressiveness, seriousness, influence, weight and presence. And what the Romans understood but the modern world seems to have forgotten is that, to borrow from Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, it's possible for all of us to learn to ""carry yourself with authority."" In my book ""Gravitas: Communicate With Confidence, Influence and Authority (Random House) 2014,"" I explore what the ancient world has to teach us in the modern age about unlocking our innate gravitas. And if I were to share the absolute essential aspect of gravitas to success in leadership it would be your ability, as ""pilot of the plane,"" to handle turbulence. Stability is the essence of gravitas. Stable equilibrium is defined in physics as, ""A state in which the body tends to return to its original position after being disturbed."" This inner emotional ballast is also key when it comes to gravitas. The Sanskrit word ""guru"" means ""weighty one,"" implying someone who cannot easily be knocked over. This stability -- emotionally, psychologically, physically -- is key to your gravitas. I learned most about this principle from a coach called Yoda (his nickname because of the wisdom he exudes). Yoda transforms the people he works with -- from having jerky, twitchy faces and voices and the knee-jerk reactions of people trying to cope with unsustainable workloads and stressful demands, they take on a far more grounded, centered presence; they seem wiser, more resourceful; and they get results -- big time. So, of course, I asked Yoda his secret. What became clear was that Yoda was teaching his clients that you have to be aware of and able to lead yourself before you effectively lead others. Yoda told me a story about one of the young leaders at managing director (MD) level. The MD was focused and ambitious and had started to do the mindfulness practice Yoda had suggested for him. At the beginning of each day he'd spend 10 minutes becoming calm and centered. It paid off. One day he found himself confronted directly by the chairman in a board meeting. Yoda watched as three times the chairman attacked the young MD's ideas. Each time the MD calmly and confidently held his ground, swinging the discussion round to his point of view. The chair, disarmed by the MD's calm, graceful and focused response to his attack, started to listen. He agreed to the MD's recommendations. Later that day the MD got a call from the CEO of the organization, who'd watched this exchange of views in the board meeting: ""We've got 10 new jobs going in the management restructure, which one do you want?"" By staying present and steady the MD had communicated his ideas without creating an argument and without caving in. He'd held his ground and found his stability even as the political terrain shifted. He had emanated gravitas. Others noticed and his life changed as a result. Leadership of the self starts with knowing yourself. As Yoda told me, self-awareness is key: ""It helps you find a deep and compassionate center in yourself where you're not dislodged or anxious because of what's going on around you. You've got an internal source -- your capacity, your own intelligence. When you learn to rest into that ... it expresses itself through your voice and your own consciousness."" As the Romans understood very well, your ability to manage yourself is a reflection of your leadership of a wider sphere. If you can be trusted to stand firm under pressure it suggests you might be able to manage others. And as the ancient world understood, calming the body is as key as educating the mind. In modern times you'd do well to learn from them if you want to make your way to the C-Suite. READ THIS: How to channel anger, lust and greed . READ THIS: Five ways to resign in style .

"(CNN) -- Not even on Valentine's Day am I much of a romantic. I hardly ever think to buy flowers for my wife or plan fun getaways, and I rarely remember our anniversary. To be fair, neither does she. We're usually reminded of our anniversary only when her mother's congratulatory card arrives with a little check tucked inside. Oh yeah, we think. It's that time of year again. How many years has it been? Which anniversary is this? Paper? Copper? Sometimes I have to take off my wedding ring and look at the date, which is etched inside. In the card my mother-in-law will have written: ""Spend this on a nice dinner out for the two of you!"" ""How sweet of her,"" Cathi will say. ""She's so nice to do this every year,"" I'll say. And then we'll deposit the check in our mutual checking account and promise ourselves a nice dinner out, which usually fails to materialize. Maybe a portion of that check will go toward the electric bill, which powers our air conditioner, which keeps us cool and comfortable in the hot summer months. That's kind of romantic, right? Not really. What can I say? Romance just isn't in our DNA. And yet I spend my days reading other people's love stories. For the past 10 years I've edited a column in The New York Times called ""Modern Love,"" in which strangers write personal essays spilling the details of their love lives for a mass audience. A lot of their stories aren't very romantic, either, but many of them are: tales of swooning singletons traveling great distances for love, or planning elaborate proposals, or pouring their hearts out in ways that expose them to crushing rejection. Stories like that make me think I should be more romantic. But at this point, Cathi and I have been married almost 22 years. Our patterns are kind of established. We love each other and support each other's work and aspirations. We're good parents together. We're really good at making each other laugh. At dinner parties, we'd still rather sit next to each other than be broken up and forced to talk to other people. Isn't that enough? I know what you're thinking. This guy is hopeless! And not in the sense of being a hopeless romantic! Some say romance is dying in this age of commercialized and computerized matchmaking. They say romance is being killed by a world of constant communication. How can you miss someone when you can FaceTime with him or her 24/7? Where is the mystery when you can follow each other's Twitter feed and Facebook posts at work during the day or when away on a business trip? I've even heard of husbands and wives using ""Find My iPhone"" to locate their spouses if they're not answering calls or texts, as if the thing was invented to serve as a GPS tracking device. And after our laptop locates the signal, we think: Oh, she's just at CVS. Oh, he's just walking the dog down by the river. Not a lot of mystery there. Nothing to wonder about. If absence makes the heart grow fonder, what does continual presence do? Make the heart grow bored? With Cathi and me, technology has nothing to do with our unromantic affliction. Our love has sidestepped romantic traditions from the beginning. We got engaged on a ferry boat in San Francisco Bay. That's romantic, right? Well, not for us. We had departed from Fisherman's Wharf, bound for Sausalito, when Cathi said, ""So are we getting married, or what?"" ""Yeah, we should,"" I said. And that was it. We had become engaged. Even though I hadn't proposed. Hadn't knelt. Hadn't pulled a hidden ring box from my pocket or sock and presented it to her with a big, goofy smile. Hadn't memorized or delivered any heartfelt lines. I don't even think we kissed. By then we had been together for almost two years. We were both 29, nearing the end of our graduate school days, and obviously had to figure out what was next for us. Our marriage and family clock was ticking, and our parents' expectations were mounting. I wanted to marry Cathi and assumed we would get married, and yet I hadn't taken a single step in that direction. Why hadn't I? I wish I could claim some standard excuse like cold feet or commitment issues or a laundry list of doubts, but it wouldn't be true. I wasn't worried about Cathi specifically or about marriage generally. I expected it would all work out fine. I wasn't concerned about joining her family or her joining mine. I was simply procrastinating because I didn't want to face the work and stress that proposing and then planning a wedding would require. As we steamed past Alcatraz Island (no prison symbolism intended), Cathi asked if I had any thoughts about a ring. ""No,"" I said. ""But I'll ask my mother."" Oof. In the end, though, my mother delivered. She had a family heirloom kind of ring with a little diamond chip that we got sized for Cathi's finger, and that made it official. Some months later, during our pre-wedding planning, we went to a strip mall in West Orange, New Jersey, and ordered matching gold bands. As we walked out, I felt a little misty eyed, and I don't think it was just because of the pollution. Some months later we walked down the aisle. We said our vows. We kissed. We danced. We celebrated. And later that night we strode into our fancy hotel room, where I pulled from my pockets the cash and checks people had given us, and I scattered the loot all over the bed. No one had told me that people tend to stuff money into the groom's pockets at weddings, and I have to say it felt really romantic to lie in all that cash together on a king-size hotel bed. We'd done it. We had turned our love into marriage. It was the start of everything. It's a date that will be etched forever in -- my ring.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine opened an investigation into a terrorist threat after Friday's hijack attempt by a Ukrainian man on a Turkish airliner, the country's chief of investigations, Maksym Lenko, told reporters Saturday. The suspect said there was ""a bomb on board,"" Turkish officials said, and he tried to divert the plane to Sochi, Russia -- the site of the Winter Olympics. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said no explosives or guns were found on board. The man, who was not named by Ukrainian authorities, is from the Ukrainian city of Kharkov, where he bought a plane ticket and boarded the Pegasus Airlines flight that left for Istanbul on Friday afternoon with 110 passengers on board, Lenko said. According to Lenko, witnesses said the man tried to enter the cockpit and demanded the plane change route to Sochi, where ""there are (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (Ukrainian President Viktor) Yanukovych, whose hands got blood on them."" Witnesses said the other demand was to ""free hostages in Ukraine,"" Lenko said. The pilots tricked him by turning the plane twice, and the suspect calmed down once he thought his demand was being met, Lenko said. The plane then landed safely. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said no one was injured and the suspect voluntarily turned himself in to police, but the Istanbul governor had a different story. Gov. Huseyin Avni Mutlu said special forces boarded the plane during the evacuation of passengers and used force to take the suspect into custody. ""We had to use force because we were trying to persuade him and he wasn't persuaded,"" Mutlu said. ""Without using guns, force was used. He has a light injury."" The suspect had a carry-on bag with some electronics, the governor said, and may have been under the influence of ""substances."" ""He thought for a while he was going to Sochi, but after a while he realized he was in Istanbul,"" he said. The suspect was not able to enter the cockpit, and no bomb was found on him, he said. Airlines warned of possible toothpaste tube bombs . Ukrainian Embassy officials in Istanbul were expected to meet the suspect who was taken into custody by Turkish authorities after the plane safely landed in Istanbul, Lenko said. Ukrainian investigators are also trying to determine the suspect's motive for the hijacking attempt, whether he was drunk and why he chose that particular flight.","Ukraine has opened an investigation into a hijack attempt .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- When you see people at the office using such Internet sites as Facebook and MySpace, you might suspect those workers are slacking off. A social-networking site for the world of spying officially launches for the U.S. intelligence community this month. But that's not the case at the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency, where bosses are encouraging their staff members to use a new social-networking site designed for the super-secret world of spying. ""It's every bit Facebook and YouTube for spies, but it's much, much more,"" said Michael Wertheimer, assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analysis. The program is called A-Space, and it's a social-networking site for analysts within the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies. Instead of posting thoughts about the new Avenged Sevenfold album or Jessica Alba movie, CIA analysts could use A-Space to share information and opinion about al Qaeda movements in the Middle East or Russian naval maneuvers in the Black Sea. The new A-Space site has been undergoing testing for months and launches officially for the nation's entire intelligence community September 22. ""It's a place where not only spies can meet but share data they've never been able to share before,"" Wertheimer said. ""This is going to give them for the first time a chance to think out loud, think in public amongst their peers, under the protection of an A-Space umbrella."" Wertheimer demonstrated the program to CNN to show how analysts will use it to collaborate. ""One perfect example is if Osama bin Laden comes out with a new video. How is that video obtained? Where are the very sensitive secret sources we may have to put into a context that's not apparent to the rest of the world?"" Wertheimer asked. ""In the past, whoever captured that video or captured information about the video kept it in-house. It's highly classified, because it has so very short a shelf life. That information is considered critical to our understanding."" The goal of A-Space, like intelligence analysis in general, is to protect the United States by assessing all the information available to the spy agencies. Missing crucial data can have enormous implications, such as an FBI agent who sent an e-mail before September 11, 2001, warning of people learning to fly airplanes but not learning to land them. ""There was the question, 'Was that a dot that failed to connect?' Well, that person did this via e-mail,"" Wertheimer said. ""A-Space is the kind of place where you can log that observation and know that your fellow analysts can see that."" Even though Facebook, MySpace and other social-networking sites that inspired A-Space are predominantly the domain of young people, there apparently is no such generational divide on A-Space. ""We have found that participation in A-Space crosses every conceivable age line and experience line. People are excited, no matter what age group,"" Wertheimer said. Of course, the material on A-Space is highly classified, so it won't be available for the public. Only intelligence personnel with the proper security clearance, and a reason to be examining particular information, can access the site. The creators of A-Space do not want it to be used by some future double agent such as Jonathan Pollard or Robert Hanssen to steal America's 21st-century secrets. ""We're building [a] mechanism to alert that behavior. We call that, for lack of a better term, the MasterCard, where someone is using their credit card in a way they've never used it before, and it alerts so that maybe that credit card has been stolen,"" Wertheimer said. ""Same thing here. We're going to actually do patterns on the way people use A-Space."" Yes, analysts can collect friends on A-Space the way people can on Facebook. But nobody outside the intelligence community will ever know -- because they're secret. CNN's Barbara Starr and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","U.S. intelligence agencies are urging staffers to use a new social-networking site .

"(CNN) -- More than 50 vehicles -- including a bus carrying Boy Scouts -- collided in a massive pileup on a snow-swept New Hampshire interstate Sunday, closing the highway in one direction for five hours, authorities and witnesses said. Cars and buses are crunched together after a major pileup on Interstate 93 on Sunday. There were no fatalities and no apparent life-threatening injuries, although rescue personnel were working to extricate people from crushed vehicles on Interstate 93 near Derry, according to Lt. Chris Aucoin of the New Hampshire State Police. Stephanie Hasenauer was traveling with her son on a bus taking about 30 Boy Scouts on a ski trip. She said the bus came upon an auto accident at about 9 a.m. and stopped. Then, she said, ""at least 30 or 40 cars all piled up behind us.""  Watch the aftermath of the massive pileup » . ""It was unbelievable. There were cars, buses, 18-wheelers, plow trucks,"" Hasenauer told CNN. ""Most people [in wrecked vehicles] couldn't get out of their doors -- they were climbing out the windows,"" she said. ""One guy who was further back, his car went under [an] 18-wheeler and couldn't get out. The first thing the firefighters did when they got there was try to save him."" Hasenauer said the bus was bumped by at least two cars but there were no injuries on the bus. People in other vehicles were not so lucky. ""The worst thing I saw was this one family -- there was a man in his 40s, he had a lot of cuts, he had blood on his face and head,"" Hasenauer said. ""We saw a lot of blood on the road and snow.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's competition watchdog has ordered airport operator BAA to sell three of its seven airports, including two in London. BAA must sell Gatwick Airport first. BAA must sell Gatwick and Stansted airports in London and either Edinburgh or Glasgow airports in Scotland within two years, the Competition Commission said Thursday. In publishing its decision Thursday, the commission said the sale of the airports will encourage competition ""where today there is no competition at all."" BAA owns seven airports in the United Kingdom, including London's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. The Competition Commission says there are competition problems at all seven airports, with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines. Finding new owners for the three airports will result in lower prices and improved customer service, said Christopher Clarke, chairman of the study. All three must have separate buyers, the commission said. ""The precise pace and the precise ways in which the benefits from such competition will emerge may be uncertain, but we are confident that the benefits will build over time, driven by the momentum of the development of competition, and will be significant,"" Clarke said. In London, for instance, BAA's ownership of three airports prevents them from building more capacity and keeps prices high, the commission said. ""The intensity of price competition may initially be limited by current capacity constraints and price controls, but these constraints are themselves at least in part the result of common ownership,"" the commission said. BAA said it acknowledged the need to change but did not agree with all of the commission's findings. ""We believe the commission's analysis is flawed and its remedies may be impractical in current economic conditions,"" BAA said in a statement, adding it needs more time to consider the report before responding further. Carrier Virgin Atlantic, a longtime critic of BAA's ownership of the airports, welcomed the commission's decision. ""It will undoubtedly benefit consumers,"" said airline spokesman Paul Charles. ""Better airport facilities in the UK and lower prices will be the result. ... The important next step is to ensure that there is adequate oversight of the divestment process."" BAA must sell the airports in sequence, beginning with Gatwick -- which went up for sale in September -- then Stansted and then either Edinburgh or Glasgow, the commission said. The Competition Commission is an independent public group that investigates mergers, markets and regulated industries. The Office of Fair Trading, a government department, asked the commission to look into airport competition in March 2007. The once-state owned BAA, which used to be known as the British Airports Authority, was privatized in 1986 and floated on the stock market in 1987. It is now owned by Spanish property group Ferrovial.","UK airport operator BAA told to sell 3 of its 7 airports, including two in London .

"(CNN) -- A California man accused of running a ""revenge porn"" website told CNN affiliate KFMB that he hasn't done anything criminal, but that he understands why people are upset and is done with the business. ""I just don't want to be involved in that kind of website anymore,"" Kevin Bollaert told KFMB. ""I want to do good things with my life."" Bollaert, 27, of San Diego, is accused of creating one website that allowed people to post explicit images of people without their permission, and creating another one soliciting payments to get the photographs taken down. Authorities on Tuesday charged Bollaert with 31 felony counts of conspiracy, identity theft and extortion, the state attorney general's office said. Court documents allege that in December 2012, Bollaert created the website ugotposted.com, which allowed for the posting of sexually explicit photographs of people without their permission. ""This website published intimate photos of unsuspecting victims and turned their public humiliation and betrayal into a commodity with the potential to devastate lives,"" Attorney General Kamala D. Harris said. The sexually explicit material, primarily of women, was routinely posted by angry former boyfriends and ex-husbands, authorities said. It contained their real names and links to their Facebook profiles. Prosecutors allege Bollaert also created a second website, changemyreputation.com, that charged up to $350 to remove the content, the documents said. Bollaert made tens of thousands of dollars through the website, prosecutors allege. Neither website was operational Wednesday morning. A 20-year-old Reno, Nevada, woman whose nude pictures appeared on the site told KFMB that she didn't know how the photos got there, but that it was devastating. ""You should have seen me. I was a wreck. I was bawling my eyes out,"" the woman said. ""That's me, that's my personal nakedness, and everyone can see it now."" Bollaert denied doing anything illegal. ""I don't feel like I've committed any crime,"" he said, adding that he knows why there's an uproar. ""I understand that a lot of people would be upset by what would happen and be hurt,"" Bollaert said. KFMB reported that court documents contained pleas to the website from women who said the postings resulted in nearly around-the-clock harassment from creepy men. ""I have gone to the police, I've had a restraining order put in place because of this site, (and) my phone has been going off EVERY 2 MINUTES with strange men sending inappropriate things to me,"" one woman, who said she was a minor when the photographs were posted, wrote to the website, according to the court documents cited by KFMB. ""It's disgusting. Also, I've had to ... have a sexual harassment charge put in place in court because of this. I don't know what gets you off about ruining people's lives, but I was underage in the photos posted of me so, yes, you are showing child pornography,"" she wrote.

"(CNN) -- Think Paris, and the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Élysées and haute couture come to mind. But the City of Light also is rich in African-American history. Keeping this history alive are tour companies that share it, up close and personal, with visitors to France. From legendary entertainer Josephine Baker to internationally acclaimed artist Henry Ossawa Tanner to World War I's ragtime-and-jazz-playing ""Harlem Hellfighters,"" Paris has embraced African-American culture like few other places. Because of that legendary embrace -- one that black folks in the States had heard about since the 1800s -- Paris loomed large in their imaginations. To many who didn't always feel welcome in their native country, the city sounded like a place where they could emotionally exhale. ""It's always been about freedom for us,"" says Marcus Bruce, the Benjamin E. Mays Professor of Religious Studies at Bates College and author of ""Henry Ossawa Tanner: A Spiritual Biography."" He's now researching a book on African-Americans at the worldwide Paris Exposition of 1900 and exploring their Parisian lives in the 19th and 20th centuries. Legendary Harlem-born author James Baldwin, who left for Paris in 1948, said ""African-Americans discover in Paris the terms by which they can define themselves. It's the freedom to work beyond the assumptions of what we can and can't do as African-Americans. It's a different rhythm and pace. We can imagine ourselves in new ways in that space."" 10 fabulous free finds in Paris . That's where these treks through African-American history come in. Walking the Spirit Tours . Julia Browne launched Walking the Spirit Tours in 1994, and it became the first company to focus specifically on black American history in Paris. Back then, she says, ""I'd contact travel agents in the States and they would say, 'Why would people want to do that?'"" Times have changed for Browne, who is based near Toronto and frequently travels to France to lead tours. For example, Browne's ""Writers, Artists & Intellectuals"" tour traipses through the lively Latin Quarter and chic Saint-Germain-des-Pres. Her guests get to peek inside the Parisian café where Richard Wright wrote and see the urban landscapes that inspired Boston-born painter Lois Mailou Jones. ""The Entertainers"" tour strolls still-vibrant Montmartre, the quartier where both Josephine Baker and Ada ""Bricktop"" Smith once owned clubs. Snapshots: City of Light -- and love . While 85% of Walking the Spirit tour-goers are African-American, ""We do a lot of school groups from Switzerland, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey and more and more French schools and organizations. It's professors in European universities who are teaching black studies,"" says Browne. ""For African-Americans or black Europeans, it creates a tremendous sense of pride and belonging. ""Paris is not just a foreign city,"" says Browne, a certified France specialist who also offers black history tours elsewhere in France. Browne has hired a 20-something Walking the Spirit tour guide who moved to Paris from the States to pursue a singing career, and her experience in the city ""brings it up to date. People enjoy hearing the real, on-the-ground stories from her."" A new DVD vividly captures much of what Browne's tours bring to life. In ""When African Americans Came to Paris,"" Browne, award-winning documentarian Joanne Burke, and writer/cameraman David Burke feature six short videos that offer a fascinating, early 20th century look at black Americans in Paris. Walking the Spirit Tours operate year-round, with prices ranging from $60 to $70 per adult, with children up to age 15 half-price. Black Paris Tours . Oakland, California, native and former broadcast journalist Ricki Stevenson fulfilled a lifelong dream of moving to the City of Light, and in 1997 launched Black Paris Tours. Her talk show host roots are obvious as she recounts the experiences of now legendary black American expatriates for guests. With the historic Arc de Triomphe on the famed boulevard Champs-Élysées as the backdrop for her tour's start, Stevenson uses laminated photos and sketches as props that help bring this brand of American history to light. ""I can do five tours in one week and they won't be the same. It really depends on the people,"" says Stevenson, who like Browne frequently gets university groups from around the world. Her tours also have attracted American celebrities and politicians, including R&B star Brian McKnight and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. ""It really depends on the level of interest, the level of understanding. I've had professors of African-American history on the same day, and it was just magic."" As she's done for years, Stevenson punctuates her historical soundtrack with a primer on Parisian protocol: ""How to be polite, what to expect, so that they get into being French for a minute."" She advises her guests to always greet store owners and clerks with a friendly bonjour or bonsoir when entering and au revoir when leaving; to keep their voices low when on trains and buses and in restaurants. ""They may come as tourists, but I want them to leave as travelers who don't just pick up souvenirs. I try to make that correlation so they understand where they are, what the culture is. ""Having been a travel reporter for six years and traveling all over the world, I want to see where people go to shop. Take me to the 'hood. I want to see us (black Parisians) as much as possible."" Since spring 2012, one of Black Paris Tours' four guides functions as a ""nightlife coordinator"" for guests who want to experience Paris after dark. This French-speaking guide arranges evenings on the town for guests, handles plans for dining, entertainment and transportation -- and will accompany them on these adventures. Black Paris Tours operate Monday-Friday except during late December and January. Adult tour prices range from €70 (about $94) for a two-thirds day tour to €100 (about $134) for a full-day walking-bus tour (doesn't include €10 lunch). Children from age 5 to 15 are €30 each. Discounts are available for groups of eight or more. Entrée to Black Paris . When Houston native Dr. Monique Y. Wells began leading tours in Paris more than 10 years ago, most of her guests were university study-abroad groups. She still gets them, but Entrée to Black Paris now has expanded to offer 12 different African-American history walks, including ""Black History in and Around the Luxembourg Garden"" and ""Montparnasse -- The Artists' World."" Wells' company specializes in private, guided tours, and her most popular is ""Black Paris After World War II,"" which Wells says offers ""a lot of talk about the entire African-American diaspora experience."" ""It's important for African-Americans to see there are other race struggles going on in the world,"" says Wells, whose e-book ""Black Paris Profiles,"" shares the stories of 24 black American and Afro-Caribbean folks who reinvented their lives here. ""And for people who are not black and taking the tours -- if they are Americans -- to see just how much the African-American presence has brought to Paris. The Paris they know would not be the same, and it's important for them to understand that."" Wells mentions jazz, first introduced to France by black Americans. Not only has this music led to a French-grown jazz culture, but ""so much art from the 20th century has been influenced by jazz."" Culinary contributions also figure into Entrée's year-round tours. ""When I moved here, you could not find sweet potatoes on mainstream menus,"" says Wells, a co-author of ""Food for the Soul: A Texas Expatriate Nurtures Her Culinary Roots in Paris."" Now, she says, this African-American Southern food staple is everywhere -- and served thinly sliced and fried as a bite-sized hors d'oeuvre or soup garnish. Passionate about helping tourists explore French culture through food, Wells this month will start joining Jacksonville, Florida-based Chef Amadeus for ""The Southern Passion Lounge in Paris,"" an Internet radio show. Broadcast the third Thursday of each month at 1 p.m. ET, they'll transport listeners to Parisian eateries through food, wine and music -- and also will spotlight French restaurants and chefs in the States. The newest Entrée to Black Paris offering takes guests to the western Parisian suburbs for the ""Josephine Baker Tour in Le Vésinet."" They'll see Le Beau Chêne, the mansion Baker owned and called home for 18 years, have lunch at a nearby American-owned bed and breakfast and learn about Baker's life over dessert. Wells and husband Tom Reeves also operate Discover Paris!, a service offering everything from gourmet food tours to self-guided downloadable walks to presentations on ""Black Paris and the Myth of a Colorblind France."" Entrée to Black Paris' prices range from $25-$30 for self-guided walking tours to $325 for private, guided walking tours for between one and 15 people (no per-person charge). Activities such as museum art walks and the ""Josephine Baker Tour in Le Vésinet"" are group-only; contact info@parisinsights.com for prices.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- The United States may have been behind the killing of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old Iranian woman whose fatal videotaped shooting Saturday made her a symbol of opposition to the June 12 presidential election results, the country's ambassador to Mexico said Thursday. Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, was shot to death in Tehran on Saturday. ""This death of Neda is very suspicious,"" Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri said. ""My question is, how is it that this Miss Neda is shot from behind, got shot in front of several cameras, and is shot in an area where no significant demonstration was behind held?"" He suggested that the CIA or another intelligence service may have been responsible. ""Well, if the CIA wants to kill some people and attribute that to the government elements, then choosing women is an appropriate choice, because the death of a woman draws more sympathy,"" Ghadiri said. In response, CIA spokesman George Little said, ""Any suggestion that the CIA was responsible for the death of this young woman is wrong, absurd and offensive."" Though the video appeared to show that she had been shot in the chest, Ghadiri said that the bullet was found in her head and that it was not of a type used in Iran. ""These are the methods that terrorists, the CIA and spy agencies employ,"" he said. ""Naturally, they would like to see blood spilled in these demonstrations, so that they can use it against the Islamic Republic of Iran. This is of the common methods that the CIA employs in various countries."" But, he added, ""I am not saying that now the CIA has done this. There are different groups. It could be the [work of another] intelligence service; it could be the CIA; it could be the terrorists. Anyway, there are people who employ these types of methods."" Asked about his government's imposition of restrictions on reporting by international journalists, Ghadiri blamed the reporters themselves. ""Some of the reporters and mass media do not reflect the truth,"" he said. For example, he said, international news organizations have lavished coverage on demonstrations by supporters of Mir Hossein Moussavi, whom the government has said lost to the incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by a landslide. But those same news organizations have not shown ""many, many demonstrations in favor of the winner,"" he said. Further, he said, members of the international news media have failed to report on people setting banks and buses afire or attacking other people. ""The only things they show are the reactions of the police,"" he said. Because of restrictions on reporting in Iran, CNN has been unable to confirm many of the reports and claims relating to protests. Ghadiri said it is only fair that security forces protect the lives and property of the Iranian people. ""If in America supporters of Mr. McCain had gotten out on the street and tried to burn the banks during the last election, do you think the police would just sit idly by and be a spectator?"" he asked, referring to the GOP presidential candidate who lost the presidential vote in November to Barack Obama. Ghadiri called on backers of Moussavi to ""accept the majority's victory."" Ahmadinejad's overwhelming victory was no surprise, Ghadiri said, noting that a poll published in the United States three weeks before the June 12 elections showed Ahmadinejad with a commanding lead. ""Why don't you show that?"" he asked. Ghadiri also addressed questions about the rapid reporting of the election results, which the opposition has cited as evidence that the ballots were not properly counted. ""It wasn't said that only four people counted the 40 million votes,"" he said. ""There were tens of thousands of people in Iran who counted these votes. They declared that this is very simple.""","Ambassador to Mexico says CIA or other intelligence service may be to blame .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Sarah Palin touched on a host of topics -- including Reaganomics, China and human rights, Tibet, the Asian and U.S. economies, family and moose in Alaska -- as she delivered a speech to investors Wednesday in Hong Kong, according to audience members. Sarah Palin's speech at CLSA Investors' Forum appeared to be largely well received. The former Republican vice presidential candidate was the keynote speaker at the 16th CLSA Investors' Forum, in what was billed as her first speech outside North America. She recently stepped down as Alaska's governor. Her 90-minute address, which was closed to the media, was heard by 1,100 people, according to CLSA head of communications Simone Wheeler. Those who attended her speech said she did well, though some could be seen leaving early on. A few of those people said they were heading to other forum offerings. Most people declined to speak with the media about the speech. Would you pay to see Sarah Palin give speech? Soundoff below . ""I can't say I was actually impressed,"" said Mel Goode, a business developer from New York who lives in Hong Kong. ""She speaks well -- a broad spectrum of what her beliefs are, family views. ""She didn't get (into) anything too harsh ... just kept it, five children, my husband's here, we believe in what Asia's doing, America has a way to go to get itself back together, Reaganism.""  Watch more about Palin's trip » . One area she touched on was human rights, calling on Beijing to be more attentive to the issue in Tibet and countries such as Myanmar and North Korea, he added. Read about the secrecy surrounding Palin's speech . Rajesh Kothari, a fund manager, noted that Palin's ""address was more geared towards politics and very focused on China."" ""She did speak about the political implications of China's rise on Asia and the region, and China with America,"" he said. ""I was quite impressed by her knowledge. It seemed like she did her homework now, this time around."" Palin also spoke about Alaska, the need for less government and fewer regulations, fiscal responsibility and ""how the U.S. and Asia can be better partners on the global stage,"" said Jasbeena Layman, a fund manager in the United States. ""I think she is very well spoken,"" she said. Palin's political ambitions are unclear, though she has recently attacked U.S. President Barack Obama's health care initiative. During the 2008 presidential campaign, she was lampooned by critics and comedians for suggesting that she had foreign policy experience because she was then governor of Alaska and ""you can actually see Russia"" from part of the state.  Watch CNN's Jessica Yellin report on Palin's speech » . Goode said it appeared Palin had ""learned quite a bit"" from the vice presidential campaign spotlight. ""I am sure she's taken enough criticism where, at this point, she would definitely try to learn a little bit in her mistakes,"" he said. He said she shied from discussing U.S. politics, though she did say it had been 10 months since Obama took office and Americans were questioning whether he had made significant headway. Past CLSA keynote speakers include former U.S. President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, rocker and activist Bob Geldof, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, Wheeler said, noting that CLSA does not disclose whether or how much it pays speakers. ""What we look to do is invite our keynote speakers who we feel are opinion makers, who are newsworthy and who we feel our clients -- a very broad international client base -- would be interested in hearing from,"" Wheeler said Monday, noting that CLSA was a politically neutral, independent brokerage. Chad Tendler, who works in the financial industry, said Palin's speech tried ""to tick a lot of boxes,"" touching on domestic and foreign policy, as well as issues that resonate with investors. He said she spoke about the U.S. relationship with China and recent issues, such as a tariff dispute between the two nations involving the sale of tires. He said her speech was ""very well scripted,"" but a question-and-answer session afterward ""brought out a bit more color about her as a person"" and reminded everyone of ""the candidate who we all saw campaigning for vice president."" She talked about her family, her interests and even Alaskan moose, he said. ""She said on her way to the airport in Anchorage, there was a moose in the town,"" he said. ""As she arrived in Hong Kong, coming in from the airport, she was surprised -- not surprised -- but, very different from the rural setting to an urban setting."" Wheeler said Palin would be in Hong Kong only for the speech, adding that it was a short trip. Chinese-language media did not give much coverage to her appearance, and some residents and visitors were surprised to learn she was in town.","Sarah Palin speaks before about 1,000 investors at conference in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- While the country's been debating Woody Allen and Dylan Farrow, I've been thinking about Alaska, where a staggering 59% of women are subjected to sexual or intimate partner violence, including threats of violence, in their lives. Farrow expanded recently on the allegation that Allen, maker of the films ""Manhattan"" and ""Annie Hall,"" sexually assaulted her as a young girl. She stared at a toy train set while it happened, she wrote in a blog post for the New York Times. Toy trains still haunt her. Allen denies the allegations. The truth in that long-debated case may never be known, and I don't want to parse the details, since plenty of others have. But this much I can say for certain: If a survivor comes to you with a story of sexual abuse, you should start from a place of belief and compassion. Not doing so can ruin a person's life. Related: The rapist next door . And it can perpetuate a cycle of violence I saw all too clearly on a two-week trip to Alaska, in December, as part of CNN's Change the List project. Readers of this column voted for me to cover rape in the U.S. state where that crime is most frequent. Progress has been made to reduce rape rates nationwide, but Alaska still has the highest reported rape rate in the country, according to 2012 FBI crime estimates. The rate is three times the national average. (You can read more about the trip at CNN.com/Change.) In one Alaska town, I spent several days with a rapist who was sexually abused as a child. When he came forward to tell his parents about it his dad punished him, pulled his ears, and told him never to speak of it again. Related map: Reported rape by state . He didn't. Not until he served jail time for abusing his stepdaughter. ""I've got to be a man,"" he thought. ""And carry this with me alone."" Another offender told me he hid his own abuse for six decades. For rape and sexual violence to end, victims have to break their painful silence and, perhaps more importantly for everyone reading this, the rest of us have to be ready to listen. Too often, friends and law enforcement officers are inclined to blame the victim or question them with unfair harshness. As women's rights advocates have told me, rape and sex abuse victims are extremely traumatized by these crimes. That may affect the way they remember events -- the timeline may appear in clouded fragments -- and they way they react to questions that would be innocuous in other situations. Related: The lawless 'end of the land' The safe way to have these conversations isn't immediately obvious. You should never ask a rape victim, for example, what she was wearing when the assault occurred. Was he or she drinking? That question, too, can be damaging in the aftermath of an assault. It implies the victim's actions may have instigated the rape. No matter the intention, it implies someone other than the rapist is to blame. The most important thing, according to groups like the Rape Abuse & Incest National Network, is to ""listen,"" ""be there,"" and ""don't be judgmental."" Exercising this sensitivity can help ensure more rapes are prosecuted, too. Currently, according to RAINN's founder and president, Scott Berkowitz, only 40% of rapes in the United States are reported to authorities, and only 3% result in jail time. All of us can encourage survivors to come forward safely. Many of you took the brave step of sharing your stories as part of a project we're calling ""We are the 59%."" In solidarity with that percentage of Alaska women who suffer from intimate partner or sexual violence, CNN iReport asked readers to share their stories of survival -- in hopes that would be healing and might encourage others to speak out. The results were raw and powerful: . ""I laid there pretending to be asleep, too terrified to do anything."" ""It was a well-kept family secret."" ""I hoped that by cooperating it would be over quickly."" I spent an afternoon reading many of the responses (You can see a selection of them here). One of the most common and jarring themes: Survivors often aren't believed. They have to turn to each other for support. ""When the night seems endless and hope so hard to hold: Please, don't give up. You are not alone,"" wrote Robin, a 50-year-old in New Mexico. If someone tells you about their experience with sexual violence or abuse, please take time to listen -- and to remind them they absolutely are not alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John D. Sutter.","John Sutter asks readers to share stories of surviving rape and sexual violence .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Three men were convicted and sentenced Tuesday in Russia for masterminding and carrying out an acid attack on the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director, Sergei Filin. Star dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko was given six years in prison for masterminding the attack, while accomplice Yuri Zarutsky was sentenced to 10 years and driver Andrei Lipatov got four years, a reporter for the official Russian Legal Information Agency (RAPSI) who was in court told CNN. Prosecutors at the Moscow court had asked for Dmitrichenko to be given nine years in prison, RAPSI reported earlier. Filin was walking to his Moscow apartment in January when a masked assailant tossed sulfuric acid onto his face, leaving him severely burned and nearly blinded. He has spent much of the past year in Germany, where doctors have been working to save his sight. Curtain falls on Russian ballet director after tumultuous year . The case, which has been closely watched in Russia and elsewhere, has exposed the tensions and intrigues simmering below the surface at the world-renowned ballet company.

"COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- The South Carolina Democratic Party voted Thursday to keep funnyman Stephen Colbert's name off the Democratic Primary ballot, according to the party's executive director. Stephen Colbert's name won't be on the South Carolina Democratic primary ballot. The party's executive council met Thursday afternoon in Columbia to decide which candidates met the criteria to be placed on the ballot, and Colbert didn't make the cut, executive director Joe Werner said. Colbert has said he will not file for the Republican party ballot because of the $35,000 fee, so the move likely ends his bid to officially run for president in South Carolina. The host of Comedy Central's ""The Colbert Report"" filed his papers Thursday morning. To get on the ballot, a candidate must demonstrate two requirements: that he or she is viable nationally and has spent time campaigning in the state. Carol Fowler, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party and a member of the executive council, suggested Wednesday that Colbert did not meet the standard of national viability. ""He does not appear to be campaigning to win if he is only running in one state,"" she said. One of Colbert's opponents on the executive council, Charleston Democratic party chairman Waring Howe, defended the decision. ""Stephen Colbert clearly didn't qualify under our rules, and it would have been a mistake and wrong to violate our rules,"" he said. Meanwhile, long shots Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel did make the cut. Colbert, the mock conservative pundit whose show regularly features real politicians and political commentators, announced he was running as a Democrat and Republican on October 16.

"(CNN) -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal got involved in the ""Duck Dynasty"" controversy Thursday by tweeting his response to A&E's decision to suspend Phil Robertson for his inflammatory remarks in a recent GQ interview. ""I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment,"" he wrote, adding, ""it is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended."" The truth is it is a messed up situation when a governor rumored to have his sights on the presidency doesn't understand the breadth of the First Amendment. The Federal Communications Commission did not send officials into the office of Nancy Dubuc, president of A&E Networks. The FBI did not threaten to put Robertson away, and the Internal Revenue Service didn't freeze his bank accounts. This is what the First Amendment protects us from -- laws being made that restrict freedom of religion, the press and/or speech. It does not protect us from how society responds to the expression of one's religion, the press or speech. Robertson's boss punished him for his remarks. The government didn't. Now for those out of the loop, Robertson -- a 67-year-old Louisiana native and a star of ""Duck Dynasty"" who holds a master's in education -- said, ""I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person,"" and the black people he worked with ""were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues."" He also compared homosexuality to bestiality and quoted a Bible verse that essentially said anyone who is an adulterer -- which according to Matthew 5:32, includes ""anyone who marries a divorced woman"" -- is going to hell. There's a lot to chew on in the interview. (To his credit, Robertson issued somewhat of a mea culpa which, in part, read, ""We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other."") But the interview had a lot for some to be offended by, especially given the number of black, gay and divorced people there are in the United States. And while conservatives such as Sarah Palin want to drape Robertson's remarks with the banner of Christianity, the truth is not everyone who identifies as a Christian subscribes to anti-gay beliefs. Just as not everyone who identifies as a Christian believes black people were happier before the civil rights movement or that marrying a divorced woman is adultery. This variation in religious expression in general and Christian denomination in particular are also protected by the First Amendment. Not that it really matters. Robertson didn't falsely yell fire in a crowded theater -- which Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. said was not protected by the First Amendment back in 1919 -- so he is legally free to say whatever he wants to GQ about anyone he wants. But that does not mean he is protected from how people react to what he says. People like his bosses. Or those who make decisions about advertising. Or viewers. This is where Jindal -- as well as those who believe Robertson's suspension violates his constitutional right to free speech -- get it wrong. You can say some stupid stuff -- whether it's Paula Deen dropping the N-word, Alec Baldwin dropping the F-word, Jesse Jackson using a derogatory word for Jewish people as he talks about New York City -- or Bobby Knight infamously saying, ""'I think that if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.'' -- and the First Amendment will keep you from going to jail. But it is not a get-out-of-jail-free card in the eyes of society. And if you don't believe me -- try walking into your boss' office and call him or her a big fat idiot with ugly children. Then see if ""freedom of speech"" helps you keep your job.

"(CNN) -- ""Dancing with the Stars"" is down from 13 competitors to 12 after season 19's first elimination on Tuesday. The unlucky star going home was Olympic athlete Lolo Jones, who was part of one of the worst-performing teams during the season premiere on Monday night. Thanks to missed cues, her cha-cha with pro partner Keo Motsepe scored a 22 and put her in danger of being sent home. In the end, it was fashion designer Betsey Johnson, who was in last place on Monday, who gets to dance another week. When her elimination was announced, Jones, who had been openly frustrated about her performance, said she ""wouldn't have it any other way."" ""I know Betsey (Johnson) had a malfunction ... and that was a disadvantage for her,"" Jones said Tuesday. ""I'm glad she's staying, and she deserves to stay."" On Facebook, Jones shared with fans how disappointed she was with her ""Dancing"" routine and her apprehension about the criticism she felt was sure to come in light of past struggles at Olympic games. ""When I was dancing last night and messed up I had flashbacks of the three Olympics ... that people constantly tease me about,"" Jones said. ""I thought oh no here it comes again. People are going to ridicule me. I'm so tired of feeling embarrassed."" But the tough moment also taught Jones, who is a devout Christian, something about her faith.

"(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy, which New York Mayor Bloomberg called ""a storm of unprecedented proportions,"" will likely not set records for most costly or most deadly. Still, the mayor tweeted Tuesday that Sandy is ""maybe the worst #NYC has ever experienced."" The hurricane-turned-cyclone can claim several historical titles. Sandy's strength, as indicated by barometric pressure just before landfall, set a record. The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. When hurricane hunter aircraft measured its central pressure at 940 millibars -- 27.76 inches -- Monday afternoon, it was the lowest barometric reading ever recorded for an Atlantic storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The previous record holder was the 1938 ""Long Island Express"" Hurricane, which dropped as low as 946 millibars. Sandy's strength and angle of approach combined to produce a record storm surge of water into New York City. The surge level at Battery Park topped 13.88 feet at 9:24 p.m. Monday, surpassing the 10.02 feet record water level set by Hurricane Donna in 1960. Sandy's impact: State by state . New York Harbor's surf also reached a record level when a buoy measured a 32.5-foot wave Monday. That wave was 6.5 feet taller than a 25-foot wave churned up by Hurricane Irene in 2011. As Sandy approached the Northeast, forecasters were fond of pointing out that if the hurricane were a country, the area it covered would make it the 20th largest in the world -- roughly twice the size of Texas. But with tropical-force winds reaching out 580 miles, Sandy still was just the second-largest Atlantic storm on record. Hurricane Olga, another late-in-the-year storm, set the record in 2001, with tropical-force winds extending 600 miles, according to the National Hurricane Center. Transit systems struggling to restart . Sandy's power cut electricity service to a record number of people in the Northeastern United States, according to utility company numbers. There were 7.5 million businesses and households without electric power in 15 states and the District of Columbia by late Tuesday morning, according to numbers compiled by CNN from local power providers. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said 2.4 million households in his state were in the dark Tuesday, twice the number left powerless in Hurricane Irene's wake last year. ""This is the largest storm-related outage in our history,"" John Miksad, Con Edison senior vice president for electric operations, said in a company Twitter message Tuesday. Sandy changes lives forever . It will take time before we know how expensive Sandy will prove, but early estimates would not make it the costliest on record. Eqecat, which provides loss estimates to the insurance industry, calculated Tuesday that the total cost of property damage and lost business could run between $10 billion to $20 billion. Another estimate, by Kinetic Analysis Corp. research director Chuck Watson, put the Sandy's overall economic impact at $20 billion to $25 billion. Flood damage to New York's subway tunnels and potential electrical system damage is a major wild card, Watson said. Is Sandy a taste of things to come? Sandy is not expected to come near the $108 billion in damages the National Hurricane Center estimated was done to the Gulf Coast states by Katrina in 2005. With new ways for people to experience and share the storm available, new measures of impact are rising. For example, the smartphone photo-sharing app Instagram registered a record number of image uploads Monday ""at a rate of nearly 10 each second -- with the hashtags #hurricanesandy, #sandy and #frankenstorm,"" the company said.

"(CNN) -- As Crimea held a bogus referendum on independence under the watchful eye of Russian occupation force on March 16, I confess that my mind and heart were elsewhere. I have never experienced war or the threat of annihilation. But now, thanks to the Internet, like thousands of other Ukrainian-Americans I am living at the edge of an existential abyss. The violence—the war—that threatens Ukraine does not threaten me. I am in New York and Ukraine is thousands of miles away. But war will threaten my friends, colleagues and family in Ukraine. We Ukrainian-Americans must now live with the very real possibility that their lives could be extinguished if Russian President Vladimir Putin chooses to do so. Indeed, Ukraine could even disappear as a state, if he chooses to make it disappear. The Internet has inserted the reality and possibility of mass death into our lives. We watch events unfold in real time. And we watch these events unfold all day, every day. There is no respite. There is no pause. Ukrainians in Ukraine must live with the tangible threat of physical annihilation. We must live with the virtual threat. Their fears are palpable. The consequences for them of war and violence are real: destruction and death. The consequences for us are virtual: We are witnesses to tragedy and mass killings. We watch, our eyes glued to our computer screens, and we imagine the horror. Our empathy is not abstract: Our friends, colleagues and relatives are real people. Neither is our feeling of impotence abstract: It gnaws at our insides and reminds us that we, too, are dying, albeit spiritually. For three months, starting in late November, when the mass pro-democracy demonstrations began in downtown Kiev, and ending on February 21, when Ukraine's version of Papa Doc Duvalier, Viktor Yanukovych, fled and people power triumphed, we had been witnessing daily regime violence punctuated by a few killings in January and mass killings just before the regime collapsed. Every morning, turning on my computer, I wondered whether this was the day the criminal Yanukovych regime would crack down, as it continually threatened to do. If all that happened that night was a disappearance or two, a few savage beatings and fire-bombings of cars, we Ukrainian-Americans breathed a sigh of relief. You see, we had actually gotten used to daily terror. We, like the demonstrators in Ukraine, could live with that. After all, they had been living with the violence and predations of the Yanukovych regime since 2010. What we feared above all was mass violence. And then it happened. On Tuesday, February 18, about 16 demonstrators and 10 police officers were killed. We were shocked and mourned their deaths, while hoping and expecting the violence to ebb. On Wednesday, February 19, nothing happened and our hopes appeared to be justified. On Thursday, February 20, the regime ordered snipers to shoot randomly at demonstrators. Scores died. And, thanks to the Internet, we saw them being mowed down. The violence had come home. The criminal regime had insinuated itself into our lives. After Yanukovych fled and a democratic government assumed power, we rejoiced. Finally, we thought, Ukraine would be able to become ""normal"" -- free, democratic, liberal and Western. We were euphoric. The death of the country had been averted. Except that, exactly one week later, on Friday, February 28, that euphoria was replaced with the deepest of fears. Vladimir Putin's Russia invaded and occupied Crimea. That was bad enough. Far worse was yet to come. On Saturday, March 1, Putin claimed to have the right to ""defend"" ""Russian citizens"" anywhere in Ukraine, thereby giving himself carte blanche to invade any part of Ukraine he chooses. Which province would be next? On Tuesday, March 4, our existential angst got worse. At a revealing press conference, Putin claimed he had the right to go to war with Ukraine in defense of ""Ukrainian citizens."" Putin also said if he made the decision to go to war, ""women and children"" would act as a shield for Russian troops. Many Ukrainians in Ukraine now believe that a Russian invasion of mainland Ukraine is inevitable. If it happens, war will break out and thousands will die. It's hard to believe that Putin will stop with Crimea. Putin's former economic adviser Andrei Illarionov, who resigned in protest after a bloody hostage crisis, believes Russian armies will march on Kiev. Putin's ideological mentor, Aleksandr Dugin, insists that Russia's goals go beyond Ukraine into Europe -- a reunification of the Slavic peoples. Meanwhile, Russian troops and tanks are massing on Ukraine's borders. Terrified realists that we have become, we suspect the worst: that they will soon be attacking a country that dared say no to Putin. As the clouds of a massive land war appear to approach Ukraine, we watch our screens with horror and hope against hope that Russian bombs will not begin to fall on our friends, colleagues, and family in Ukraine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alexander Motyl .","Alexander Motyl: Crimea vote a joke: Many believe war with Russia inevitable .
He says when Yanukovych was overthrown, Ukrainian-Americans were euphoric .

"(CNN) -- Why was it that, while others in your class were happy to study law or go into finance, you wanted to be a popstar? Or maybe you were the rebel: an unruly and disruptive influence the teachers disliked. That said, you could have been the procrastinator -- somehow never getting started -- or the dreamy idler living in an invented parallel universe. Their commonality? All are signs you are a High-FF: someone with a high fear of failure as I call them in ""What's Stopping You?"" my book on understanding, accepting and navigating the insecurities that drive career failure. Fear of failure was first uncovered in the 1960s by psychologists such as John Atkinson. Working at Stanford University, Atkinson conducted a series of experiments on children -- setting them reward-based tasks in order to test their motivation. He noticed they divided into two camps: those focused on winning the reward, who approached the task with what he called a ""need for achievement,"" and those focused on their seemingly inevitable failure, who had what Atkinson termed a ""fear of failure"" based on their desire to avoid the public humiliation of failure. See also: Is happiness the secret of success? In one experiment the children played a game of hoop-the-peg, with greater rewards offered for greater distances. The ""need for achievement"" kids stood a challenging but realistic distance from the peg -- adding concentration if they failed. Those with fear of failure, meanwhile, stood either right on top of the peg or so far back that failure was almost certain. Of course, those choosing the impossible distance effectively disguised their fear of failure, not least because everyone failed at such a distance. Yet that was the better response. Many of the fear of failure kids became disruptive -- intonating that they didn't care for the game with some even trying to halt the entire process. Norman Feather (an Australian psychologist) undertook similar experiments and came to similar conclusions, although also found he could manipulate the response by telling the children the task was ""very difficult."" This encouraged the High-FF kids to continue -- the humiliation of failure having been lowered. And 1970s experiments by Carol Dweck and Ellen Leggett concluded that children were either ""mastery oriented,"" meaning they were focused on acquiring new skills (and were unconcerned by temporary setbacks), or ""ego oriented,"" which meant their main concern was to not lose face. The impact of fear of failure . From here, it's easy to see how such a divide can impact our career progression: indeed, our entire lives. High-FFs keep their ambitions either low or -- as a mask for their insecurities -- extraordinarily high (knowing that failing to become a TV star will be kindly judged). It's the challenging but achievable career choices (such as joining the professions) that are avoided by High-FFs. See also: ambition could make you rich, but not happy . So is there a way out? Not from our fears. Mainstream psychologists deride those -- such as hypnotists and acupuncturists -- that claim they can instantly cure our fears and phobias, stating they simply inject alien personality traits into us. These will eventually be revealed as such, producing an inevitable reckoning. Yet we can learn to accept our fears as part of us, and then navigate their destructive consequences. To do this, however, we need a plan. So here are my seven steps to overcoming (but not curing) fear of failure. 1. Discover your true values. If those popstar goals are a mask you'll need to go back to square one and calculate what really motivates you. This requires you to establish the values and principles that underline your existence. It's these that should drive your goal setting, not your insecurities. 2. Establish your goals. With your values written down, visualise yourself 10-years' hence. Every detail should be imagined: house, car, partner, office, dog (or cat). Importantly, also focus on the details of your career. What will you do day-to-day, where and with whom? Then ensure it dovetails with your values -- otherwise it will almost certainly fail. 3. Work out the milestones. The 10-year horizon is long-enough to make anything possible: including professional exams. Yet you have to ensure the path you take is the right one. So visualize yourself in five years' time. What has to be in place to ensure the 10-year goals are achievable? Then do the same for two years -- thinking about the needs for the five-year horizon. Then one year. Then six months. Then three months, one month and one week. And what can you do tomorrow to make sure the one-week goal is conquered? 4. Develop a strategy and tactics. Of course, goals fail without strong execution, while ""busyness"" can lead us in the wrong direction. We need a strategy -- a plan that ensures our actions lead us towards our objectives. So undertake a SWOT analysis: looking at your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats. This should help a strategy emerge because we can execute tactics on our strengths while developing skills to overcome our weaknesses. Meanwhile, we can pursue the opportunities (if goal-focused) and plan to navigate the threats. 5. Execute efficiently. According to Stephen Covey, all activities fall into four boxes: urgent and important, urgent and unimportant, not urgent and important, and not urgent and unimportant. We spend our time on urgent-box activities neglecting the not-urgent-and-important box that is vital for achieving our long-term goals. Yet if we start here, our activities become driven by our goals allowing us to control urgent-and-unimportant activities (otherwise called interruptions) and potentially reframing our not-urgent-and-unimportant activities as refreshing moments where we can enjoy our progress. 6. Deal with people. For High-FFs, other people are a problem. Too often, we become reactive and defensive, or potentially manipulated by people leveraging off our insecurities. Yet dealing with difficult people is possible once we have ""developed our compassion"" -- i.e. we've stopped seeing the world from our own perspective and, instead, seen it from theirs. If done genuinely, we can then forge win-win strategies that turn potential enemies and barriers to our progress into allies that can help us achieve our goals. 7. Find your unique gift. Still struggling? Just maybe you haven't found your unique gift. Everyone has a special talent or insight that they should first discover and then offer to others. Mine was a curiosity regarding my condition (as a High-FF) and a background in writing. I combined the two to write ""What's Stopping You?"" What's yours?

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- As it entered its second week, the Oscar Pistorius murder trial turned into an episode of ""CSI,"" replete with gory autopsy details and photographs of the crime scene. Even the bathroom door through which he shot his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, was reassembled and put up in court. Drama from the trial came from a police expert swinging Pistorius' cricket bat at the door in court to try to determine whether he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he did it. It came as well from detailed descriptions of the damage hollow-tip bullets do to human flesh. And then, of course, there was the effect of the evidence on Pistorius himself, who spent hours vomiting as he was forced to relive seeing Steenkamp's mortal wounds. The sprinter admits that he killed Steenkamp, his 29-year-old girlfriend of about four months, on Valentine's Day 2013 but says it was a terrible accident, not premeditated murder. Pistorius, 27, is pleading not guilty to murder and three other weapons charges. Prosecution and defense battled all week over the meaning of four types of evidence. One: The autopsy . Steenkamp died of multiple gunshot wounds, including one that passed through her brain from above her right eye to the base of her skull, pathologist Gert Saayman testified. That wound was probably almost instantly fatal, he said, but either of the two other bullets that hit her in the hip and the right arm could have been fatal on their own, he said. She also had a wound between the fingers of one hand, he explained. The angle of the bullet that fractured her skull suggested she might not have been standing when she was hit, Saayman said. The bullets that hit her were hollow-tipped, designed to cause maximum tissue damage, he testified. Steenkamp was wearing Nike shorts and a black sleeveless top when she died, Saayman said. There's no dispute that Pistorius fired the bullets that killed Steenkamp through his bathroom door, so the most important area of debate from the autopsy was the state of food in her stomach. Saayman said it suggested she had eaten about two hours before she died, which contradicts Pistorius' version of events that they had been asleep in bed for hours before the killing. Pistorius' defense lawyer, Barry Roux, fought tooth and nail to cast doubt on Saayman's finding about the stomach contents, but Saayman gave no ground. Two: The door . The actual door through which Pistorius fired the bullets into Steenkamp was on display in court for much of the week, a mock-up of the toilet room behind it. Four bullet holes and several other marks in the wood were clearly visible. Prosecution and defense disagree on whether Pistorius put his legs on before or after bashing the door with a cricket bat to get to his girlfriend. Police forensic analyst J.G. Vermeulen testified that the angle of the bat marks in the door indicated Pistorius was still on the stumps of his legs at that point, demonstrating in court the angle of the swing. But the defense disputed his version, with two lawyers from the Pistorius team taking their own swings at the door during a break, then making Vermeulen swing on the door from his knees. Vermeulen insisted that the stances the defense made him adopt were ""unnatural,"" to which Roux responded: ""Unnatural for you."" There was also discussion of another mark in the door that Vermeulen said was not from a cricket bat. The defense says it's where Pistorius kicked the door with his prosthetic leg before going for his bat. Vermeulen said that was a possibility but refused to accept it was the only explanation. He said he had not tested the mark because his assignment had been only to check the cricket bat marks. There was also discussion about footprints that appeared on the door in some photos but are not there now. Vermeulen said they were consistent with police shoes. Roux used their disappearance to suggest the door had been handled sloppily by police -- stepping on it when it was on the floor and later wiping the marks off -- to cast doubt on its reliability as evidence. Three: Police photos of the house . The court saw more than 150 photos of Pistorius' house taken by police in the hours and days after Steenkamp was killed, showing shocking images including a blood-spattered toilet and the Olympian's gun, still cocked, on a blood-stained floor. The position of several key objects could help determine whether Pistorius is telling the truth about the events leading up to Steenkamp's death. Attention focuses on the position of spent bullet cartridges on the floor, two iPhones and the fan that Pistorius says he went out onto his balcony to get before the heard the noise which he thought was a burglar. The photos also show the trail of blood from the bathroom to the lower floor from when Pistorius carried Steenkamp's body down the stairs. Four: Phone records . Pistorius and several of his neighbors made calls to security in the minutes after the shooting. The record of the calls between about 3:15 and 3:22 a.m. have helped establish a timeline of events, even as witnesses dispute who called whom and when. Ex-police commander's testimony aids defense .","Gory autopsy details and photographs of the crime scene shown at the trial .

"(CNN) -- Last February, tens of thousands of moviegoers stormed cinemas around the United States to watch ""Chronicle,"" turning the superhero thriller into a surprise hit that topped the U.S. box office on Super Bowl weekend. The film, which follows the adventures of three American teenage boys who acquire superpowers, made $22 million that weekend alone -- traditionally considered one of the slowest weekends for the U.S. movie industry. Although set in Seattle, ""Chronicle's"" producers decided to shoot in South Africa, lured by the country's low production costs and growing reputation as an attractive destination for international filmmaking. The move paid off as the film, with production costs of just $12 million, turned out to be a big winner for 20th Century Fox. ""Chronicle"" exceeded industry expectations by piling up an impressive $126 million in global cinema ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo. ""Fox was totally stunned by it,"" says Nico Dekker, chief executive of Cape Town Film Studios, the South African facility where ""Chronicle"" was primarily shot. ""The $12 million film is looking like a $30 million or a $40 million film on the screen,"" he adds. Watch video: Cape Town takes on Hollywood . Over the years, South Africa's varied landscapes have been a favorite set location for Hollywood productions. Worldwide hits shot at least partly in the country include ""Blood Diamond,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, ""Lord of War,"" featuring Nicolas Cage, and ""Invictus,"" Clint Eastwood's take on South Africa's victory at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Read: 3D animation puts South Africa film in the picture . But while the country's stunning beaches, jagged mountains and lush vineyards have long served as a backdrop for films, as well as TV adverts, Cape Town Film Studios is now aiming to make South Africa a major destination for both location filming and top-quality studio productions. The multi-million dollar complex, the first of its kind in South Africa, boasts four soundstages, several offices, a cinema, as well as pre- and post-production services. Less than two years after it first began operations, the vast studios have already attracted an impressive roster of blockbuster films. Apart from ""Chronicle"" they were used for action movie ""Safe House,"" starring Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, the 3D comic-book adventure ""Dredd,"" and TV drama ""Mary and Martha,"" starring Hilary Swank. Dekker says the studios are a huge step for South Africa's movie industry and will help the country to build its reputation as an emerging force in global filmmaking. ""It creates a home, a base, where national and international filmmakers can meet,"" says Dekker, ""Where you can bring the latest technology together; where you can bring films like 'Dredd,' which was our first film of 3D transfer movies -- so you can now suddenly shoot stuff that we can only dream from."" Read: Gangster movie Kenya's first Oscar contender . In a country like South Africa, hit by massive unemployment and sluggish economic growth, a thriving film industry could hold a tremendous economic opportunity. Earlier this year, the South African government recognized this potential by announcing a series of incentives aimed at attracting large-budget productions to help create jobs, generate revenues and encourage tourism. The measures included an uncapped 20% rebate for foreign productions shot on location in South Africa, as well as a 22.5% break if they are also post-produced in the country. Michael Auret, managing director of South African production firm Spier Films, says the incentives have already made a big difference. ""We already have three productions for January -- up from maybe one or two productions a year the previous years -- and we've got more lined up,"" he says. ""All the production companies in South Africa have experienced an increase in films that they are doing and television programs but also increased inquiries from people who want to come and shoot here."" Auret cites the weakness of the rand against the dollar, the low cost of crews compared to other popular shooting destinations such as Australia, and the diversity of locations as South Africa's competitive advantages. ""We have both summer and winter rain in two different parts of the country,"" he explains. ""You can shoot the Mediterranean climate around Cape Town and you can shoot the tropical climate in Johannesburg -- it's desert, as well as jungles, as well as beaches, it's urban centers where they shot 'Dredd.' ""So there's very few films that can't be made here -- other than possibly a film shot completely in snow, in the Arctic or something."" Read: The film school in Kenya's biggest slum . Cape Town Film Studios, which is backed by national and local government as well as private shareholders, has also been chosen for the movie ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" the long-awaited biopic of former South African leader Nelson Mandela. The film, which is expected to be released next year starring Idris Elba, is South Africa's biggest-budgeted film, says Dekker. This is, he says, a testament that the studios can help boost local productions and enable Africans to start telling their stories to the world. ""We, ourselves, Africans, we need to almost free ourselves,"" says Dekker. ""We need to grow and to understand that the world out there is waiting for us. We've got everything now -- we've got great crews, good stories, we've got a great studio. ""We just need now to start making commercial film ... the 'Chronicles' of the world, ourselves -- that is maybe the next frontier for us.""","Cape Town Film Studios has lured some of Hollywood's biggest names to South Africa .

"(CNN) -- ""There's only one method of manipulation that has stood the test of time,"" begins the press release issued by Carrot Dating, a new dating app developed by MIT grad Brandon Wade. ""Bribery."" In fact, it's this alleged truism -- which, by the way, isn't true at all given that highly effective methods of manipulation such as lying, rationalization, denial and guilt are still very much going strong -- that inspired Carrot Dating, ""the world's first bribe-for-a-date app."" This app lets users entice potential partners into romantic outings by offering them gifts such as ""plastic surgery or a tank of gas,"" because ""messaging may get her interested, but bribery will get you a date."" Good god. It's pretty clear the founders of this app, not to mention the author of the press release, are actively courting outrage -- a quote from the founder reads, goadingly, ""Women like presents like dog like treats."" But the fact that this level of misogyny is being monetized and marketed and put into practice is disturbing. Someone, after all, gave this guy the funds to build the app and its companion website; Wade told reporters Carrot already has 30,000 users of both genders signed up. And misogynistic it is: Although women can bribe men to go out with them, too, taglines that include ""Dangle Your Carrot!"" imply which scenario Carrot Dating is aiming at. Perhaps Wade is just trying to be cheeky. This isn't, after all, the first time he's been called a misogynist or sought to monetize sexism. Carrot is just the latest in a fleet of dating sites Wade has founded. They include SeekingArrangements.com, a ""sugar daddy dating"" site that pairs young women with rich, older men; WhatsYourPrice.com, where men bid on dates with women; and MissTravel.com, which links up ""attractive"" women with ""generous"" men who want a travel companion. All three have been accused of promoting prostitution, or at least a prostitutory ethos, and that's become something of a go-to for Wade. He gets bolder, not to mention richer, with every launch and with every piece of corresponding publicity, even if it's negative -- and unsurprisingly, most of it is. Such misogyny, even if employed as part of a marketing strategy or a business shtick, has considerable effects, none of which should be taken lightly. Misogyny is a serious form of bullying directed explicitly at women. Over time, it affects the way women think about themselves. By casting men as the chasers and women as the chased, the values and actions encouraged by Carrot Dating promote sexism, violence against women and other gender imbalances that men and women have worked for years to counter. A 2007 study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology even found that vicarious exposure to misogyny, just simply witnessing such hostility against others, can create lower well-being among those not directly harassed. Carrot Dating claims to be performing a service; that is, motivating people to go on dates with those they otherwise might reject, thereby removing some of the existing barriers to romance and ""opening minds."" Wade says Carrot Dating is entirely modern, set to even the playing field in a world where, he says, women have the upper hand and their pick of men. But his app seeks to do this by validating the notion that it's normal to expect something from a date other than, say, good conversation or pleasant company; that going on a date should only happen if there's something material in it for you. Not exactly a recipe for true love. But, then, Carrot Dating isn't really about opening people's minds and expanding their options. Or about true love. It's about stirring up controversy, with hapless Carrot Dating users. At the same time, what he's stirring up is not victimless controversy. At its core, Carrot reinforces the notion that women can, and should, be bought -- the same attitude, by the way, that has made human trafficking a $34 billion business. The upside: One could argue that sites such as Carrot Dating satisfy a certain, very specific demographic and serve to connect only like-minded singles. The site may be crass, superficial and self-loathing, but then again so are many people. Why not let them mate? Or at least meet. The more of these people who date each other using sites such as Carrot, the fewer of them remain among those who might be looking for more in a partner than a free haircut or a new nose. Those who are attracted to Carrot Dating, or sites like it, know what they're getting. As for everyone else, well, at least they know what they're not.

"(CNN) -- If I had to sum up our week in Norway with one thought, it would be ""boiler suit"". We were there to film our segment for Earth's Frontiers on oil and we quickly realized that there's not much to see in the oil and gas industry that doesn't require some hard-core protective clothing. We went offshore to an oil rig in the North Sea to see how in Norway they manage to produce the greenest barrel of oil in the world. For every barrel of oil produced, 8kg of carbon dioxide is emitted. That's sixty percent less than the global average. When you visit an oil rig you see that it is an entire world in itself. At Statoil's Oseberg A platform, 90 miles west of Bergen, they have three course meals, a cinema, and even a weekly body pump aerobics class. It's definitely a perk of the job when you find yourself transported to another world, learning about things you left behind at school. I remember studying the oil cycle in chemistry, and learning about it from my father, who used to work in the industry. But back to the boiler suits... there's one suit to travel to the platform, there's another layer of safety gear to add when you take the smaller helicopter, and there's an entirely different outfit to walk around the platform in general. Accessories come in a range of fluorescent pinks, oranges and yellows. (Think headphones, ear plugs, walkie-talkies, belts, glasses, rubber hoods, shoes). Radiant in bright orange, the CNN crew flew around the rig to get some aerial shots of the platform. If you've never been in a helicopter before, it's quite a peculiar feeling when you lift off the helipad vertically. Andrew Waller, the cameraman, was actually harnessed to the roof of the helicopter because he was hanging out of the open door with a very heavy camera, trying to film the rig below for our opening sequence. It was quite impressive. As far as the eye could see there were oil and gas platforms, stretching out across the horizon. Some were in Norwegian waters, some in British waters. It really gave me a sense of the size and power of the petroleum industry. After we'd landed, the platform manager took a sample of the oil which was being processed at the rig and showed it to us. I realized it was the first time I'd ever seen oil in its true form. So many things we are surrounded by each day are made from oil, but most of us never get close to the stuff. Oil is a commodity that really influences world markets and geopolitics. It was funny to see it in a little plastic container. We get a third of the world's energy from oil, and even optimistic forecasts say it will play a significant part in meeting future energy demands. But the environmentalists we spoke to were all united in calling for an end to the world's, and Norway's, addiction to oil. In Norway they have a great attitude towards the environment. There were little notes on our beds in fifth-floor hotel rooms with encouragements to use the stairs; the napkin dispensers in restaurants are emblazoned with ""just take one""; and there were recycling bins on every street corner. I was left wondering how this environmental awareness translates into the big business of oil and gas exports. And also whether I'd be able to sneak at least one of the boiler suits home as a colorful memento of our trip. What part do you think oil has in our future energy mix? Will it be big business as usual or can the industry do more to clean itself up?  Share your thoughts in the Sound off box below .","CNN traveled to Norway to report on the oil industry .

"(EW.com ) -- Another ""Harry Potter"" star is coming to Broadway. Rupert Grint, best known for playing Ron Weasley in the blockbuster ""Harry Potter"" film franchise, will make his Broadway debut this fall in Terrence McNally's starry comedy It's Only a Play. Grint joins an A-list cast that includes Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, Megan Mullally, F. Murrary Abraham and newcomer Micah Stock. Jack O'Brien will direct the limited 17-week engagement, which opens at Broadway's Schoenfeld Theatre on October 9. The British star will play Frank Finger, the wunderkind director of a new play by an anxious writer (Broderick) whose career is on the line as he eagerly awaits the reviews on opening night. As the show roars onward, the playwright passes the time with his TV star best friend (Lane), his producer (Mullally), the show's leading lady (Channing), an infamous critic (Abraham), and a fresh-faced coat check attendant (Stock). The play first premiered in New York in 1986 at the Manhattan Theatre Club; the 2014 production is a newly revised adaptation by McNally, the four-time Tony-winning scribe whose recent premiere Mothers and Sons marked his 50th year on Broadway. On the theater acting front, Grint followed up the smashing success of the ""Potter"" films with his West End stage debut in the revival of Jez Butterworth's Mojo (alongside Skyfall's Ben Whishaw and Downton Abbey's Brendan Coyle). Grint's ""Potter"" co-star Daniel Radcliffe recently returned to Broadway in The Cripple of Inishmaan, but their stints on the New York stage won't overlap (Radcliffe's engagement ends this July).

"(CNN) -- The president of Sudan, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on allegations of war crimes and genocide, arrived Wednesday in Chad, Sudanese state-run Shorooq TV reported. Chad is legally obliged to arrest Omar al-Bashir and hand him over to the International Criminal Court, a court representative told CNN. The court has issued two warrants for al-Bashir's arrest for his alleged role in a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur, in western Sudan. The original warrant was the first one the court had ever issued against a serving head of state. It included five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also included two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. The International Criminal Court issued its second arrest warrant al-Bashir just last week. The court added three new counts of genocide to the already existing charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The new charges are in addition to the earlier ones, not instead of them, the court said. Amnesty International Wednesday called on Chad to arrest the Sudanese leader. ""Chad should not shield President al-Bashir from international justice,"" the rights group's senior legal advisor Christopher Hall said. ""His visit to Chad is an opportunity to enforce the arrest warrant and send a message that justice will prevail."" United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said through a spokesman that it was up to countries that are party to the court ""to live up to their obligations as they see fit."" ""Of course he said repeatedly that... there are charges that have been put forward by the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court and these charges are very serious,"" Ban's spokesman, Martin Nesirky, said Wednesday. Al-Bashir was re-elected president of Sudan this year in controversial but historic elections. The president has appeared to thumb his nose at the charges, appearing in public dancing and singing at a rally in Khartoum after the original arrest warrant last year. His information minister dismissed the ICC as a ""white man's tribunal."" Adding genocide to the list of charges against al-Bashir could affect the length of his sentence if he is ever tried and convicted. The African Union this year urged the court to delay war crimes proceedings against Sudan's president, saying a decision allowing genocide charges harms efforts to bring peace to Darfur. ""The African Union has always emphasized its commitment to justice and its total rejection of impunity,"" it said in a statement in February. ""At the same time, the AU reiterates that the search for justice should be pursued in a manner not detrimental to the search for peace. The latest decision by the ICC (International Criminal Court) runs in the opposite direction."" Judges at the ICC had cleared the way a day earlier for al-Bashir to be charged with genocide. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo had the genocide charge on his original arrest warrant for al-Bashir, but the pretrial judges left it off when they approved the warrant in March 2009. Moreno-Ocampo appealed in July, saying that the judges' standard of proof for adding the genocide charge was too high. The appellate court agreed with Moreno-Ocampo and ruled in his favor. Al-Bashir has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague in the Netherlands, the court says. It is not clear whether he has been in a country that is a party to the court since the arrest warrant was issued. The genocide charge could further isolate Sudan, but it could also mobilize African nations around the country. Leaders from several African countries have said the ICC has been unfair to Africa, and they have threatened to pull out of the court. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. Sudan denies that the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the U.N., Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. CNN's Amir Ahmed and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says charges against Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir are very serious .

"(CNN) -- When Americans hand out Halloween candy next week they may inadvertently be contributing to the destruction of orangutan habitat thousands of miles away. But don't feel guilty. Instead, do something about it. Many types of Halloween candy -- and lots of other packaged foods in the United States -- contain palm oil, much of which is farmed in Malaysia and Indonesia, where orangutans live. Wild forests that support the endangered orangutan are being chopped down and burned to grow geometric rows of trees that ultimately produce oil. The use of palm oil in processed foods is way, way up in part because it doesn't contain trans fat, which the United States says must be labeled on food packaging because of its unhealthiness. The U.S. imports about 10 times as much palm oil now as it did in the mid-1990s. It's not that the oil is evil. It's that production methods need to change. ""Orangutans are just so compelling,"" said Laurel Sutherlin, a spokesman for the Rainforest Action Network, which recently released a report called ""Conflict Palm Oil."" The report links irresponsible palm oil production to modern slavery and climate change -- in addition to the destruction of orangutan habitat. ""They're as closely related to us as chimpanzees. They, in a very, very real way, are being threatened with extinction, and palm oil is the single biggest threat they face."" One way to help is simply to tell snack food and candy companies that you care about orangutans and about the rain forest in southeast Asia. The Rainforest Action Network has made that easy. The group, which recently got some buzz on blogs for posting a staged video of an orangutan called Strawberry (not her real name) communicating in sign language and via video chat with a hearing-impaired girl, has started an online campaign called ""Last Stand of the Orangutan."" The group is asking people to upload photos of their palms (gotta love a homonym) to a website. It's hoping to collect 60,600 images -- or one human hand for every orangutan in the wild. They're going to deliver the images to companies that produce products from palm oil, Sutherlin told me. ""We really realized that the scale of the problem is so extreme and so large that we really wanted to help jump-start a national conversation about palm oil,"" he said, ""and reach out beyond the choir."" Rainforest Action has a list of ways to get involved on its website. The most interesting, to me, is an effort to slap stickers that say ""Warning! This snack food may cause orangutan extinction"" on products in grocery stores. To similar effect, other groups are trying to encourage consumers to buy Halloween candy that either doesn't contain palm oil or contains only palm oil that is certified as sustainable by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. The El Paso Zoo in Texas -- which, despite its sizable distance from Indonesia, has an exhibit that features orangutans -- created a list of candies that do and don't contain palm oil and published it on its website. The list, which I did not confirm independently, says Skittles, Snickers and Milky Way, all made by Mars, contain ""non-sustainable"" palm oil. ""Mars is committed to working with the broader community towards 100% traceable sources of palm oil that are free of deforestation, expansion on carbon-rich peatlands, and the violation of human and labor rights,"" the company said in an e-mail. Mars added that it will use 100% sustainable-certified palm oil by the end of the year. Industry groups and others say palm oil can be grown sustainably, is healthier than alternatives and can be grown on relatively smaller plots of land. Some animal and forest advocates say that's not enough. The only way to pressure candy makers to make their supply chains transparent and to stop clearing rain forest for palm oil plantation is to boycott all the candies and snack foods that contain palm oil, said Steve Marshall, the El Paso Zoo's director. ""The issue has been identified. There is an industry that is doing this -- and this industry is being supported by consumers simply because of ignorance,"" he told me. ""They just don't know any better. We're trying to do the dolphin-safe tuna thing."" Maybe candy is the new tuna. But figuring out how to avoid palm oil, which shows up in many products, is more difficult than picking a dolphin-safe tuna brand. Technology makes it a bit easier. The El Paso Zoo sponsored a new app -- called Palm Oil Guide & Scanner, and available for free on Android and Apple iOS -- that lets consumers scan product bar codes to determine if a particular candy contains palm oil. The app, like the zoo, says consumers should not buy products that contain the oil, whether it is certified as sustainable or not. The sustainability label is not enough to ensure orangutan habitat is not being harmed, according to Marshall. The app seems like a useful tool, especially considering the nuances involved. Palm oil can morph into more than a dozen names in the ingredients lists on the backs of product. Palmate, sodium lauryl sulphate and PKO (palm kernel oil). All are versions of ""palm oil,"" according to advocates. Meanwhile, many candy brands sell some products that contain palm oil and others that don't. It's a mess to get up to speed. And it would be expecting a miracle to think even a savvy shopper could remember it all. The Rainforest Action Network says a boycott goes too far. The important thing is that companies make their supply chains transparent and root out problems. The group asks citizens to send e-mails to food companies urging them to ""demand responsible palm oil from (their) suppliers and eliminate conflict palm oil contamination of (their) products."" Whatever your view, there's no need to skip the sweets on Halloween. But -- whether it's through a boycott or uploading a photo -- use this holiday to spread the word about the connection we all have to an endangered species. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","John Sutter: Halloween candy is contributing to orangutan habitat destruction .

"(CNN) -- Decisive, confident, disciplined, straight-forward and intelligent. These are just a few of the mostly glowing words the U.S. State Department apparently had for Margaret Thatcher in 1975, according to an alleged cable that WikiLeaks published Monday. Dated February 16, 1975, the cable attempts to explain this new rising star on Britain's political scene. At the time, Thatcher had just won control of the country's conservative party. She became prime minister in 1979 -- the only woman to hold the job. Thatcher died Monday at age 87. The cable is available along with a trove of others searchable on a massive database that WikiLeaks claims contains other U.S. documents. Several years ago, WikiLeaks became famous worldwide for publishing sensitive U.S. documents related to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. CNN cannot authenticate material on the database or the Thatcher cable itself. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell would not comment on it Monday. As it appears in digital form on WikiLeaks' site, the cable says Thatcher ""blazed into national prominence almost literally from out of nowhere"" and that her ascent was remarkable because she then had ""narrow range of prior experience."" But Thatcher had captivated the public, the cable suggests, and was the ""focus of intensive media and popular interest."" ""There is general agreement among friends and critics alike that she is an effective and forceful parliamentary performer,"" the cable reads. ""She has a quick, if not profound, mind and works hard to master the most complicated brief. She fights her corner with skill and toughness, but can be flexible when pressed. ""In dealing with the media or with subordinates, she tends to be crisp and a trifle patronizing. With colleagues, she is honest and straight-forward, if not excessively considerate of their vanities."" Read the full cable . The cable goes on to remark that Thatcher abides by the ""courage of her convictions, and once she has reached a decision to act, is unlikely to be deflected by any but the most persuasive arguments."" She was, the cable adds, ""the personification of a British middle class dream come true."" ""The daughter of a grocer, she had by dint her own abilities and application won through, securing scholarships to good schools, making a success of her chosen career, and marrying advantageously."" The British leader had ""conventional and somewhat forced charm, and above all her plummy voice stamp her as the quintessential suburban matron, and frighteningly English to boot."" The cable predicts what the future holds for Thatcher. ""If she is ever to become Britain's first woman prime minister, she must ... humanize her public image and broaden the base of her party's appeal,"" it says. ""The odds are against her, but after her stunning organizational coup d'etat this past month, few are prepared to say she can't do it.""

"(CNN) -- Optimism is all the rage. The enthusiastic cheer of motivational speakers has now received a seal of approval from scientists. So, apparently it's confirmed: Optimism is good for you. But before we rush full speed down the rah-rah route, let us pause for a moment and see exactly which road we take. We shouldn't confuse the power of positive thinking with the dangerous delusion of wishful thinking. They end at very different destinations. It's a lesson for countries, politicians, business people and all of us. Optimism by itself can be dangerous. It must always travel in the company of action, common sense, resourcefulness and considered risk-taking. ""It's all good,"" that irritating, relatively new expression, seems to always come after a description of just how not good it all is; a desperate effort to make the truth go away. It's the new version of ""don't worry, be happy."" In reality, a little worrying can lead to action, which is the principal way optimism bears fruit. One of the most inspiring and even charming traits of the U.S. is its founding and enduring spirit of optimism. No doubt, it's a little less visible now, replaced by cynicism. But America was built on a philosophical foundation of not sitting back and accepting unacceptable outcomes, instead standing up to build a better world. That's the right kind of optimism. It's the one that leads to sensible risk-taking. It acknowledges that you don't always win, that when things don't turn out well, you try a different approach and then another until you find a solution, until you reach a new continent, until you write the right constitution, until you invent the right machine. iReporter: DNC chair says she's 'pretty happy' with economy -- I'm appalled . It's the opposite of defeatism. And it's very different from denial or wishful thinking. Optimism without thoughtful and determined action can lead to disaster. It's true for individuals, it's true for business, and it's true for nations. History is full of examples. The poster boy for off-the-rails, disastrous optimism is Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who met with Hitler in 1938 and handed him a big chunk of Czechoslovakia in exchange for the Fuhrer's word. He didn't ask the Czech people what they thought, but he was giddy with excitement when he got off the plane from Munich waving a piece of paper he and ""Herr Hitler"" had signed. ""I believe it is peace for our time,"" he immortally declared. When appeasement was inevitably followed by a most horrific, brutal war, we saw a different kind of optimism, the kind that rolls up its sleeves, defies the odds and makes its own luck. Franklin Roosevelt, who presided over a country with a third-rate army, ordered an industrial transformation of the American economy on a scale that seemed simply out of reach, with the focused, urgent aim of defeating the Nazis. He declared, ""Let no man say it cannot be done. It must be done."" Many muttered that it couldn't. But the country got to work. Everyone made sacrifices. Everyone pitched in. The U.S. met production goals that were almost inconceivably ambitious. And it turned the tide of war. The first case (Chamberlain) was optimism supported by wishful thinking, as useful as buying a lottery ticket to fend off bankruptcy. The second (FDR) was optimism propelled by determined action and smart planning. This is the one that works. Optimism can take the distasteful tone of arrogance, or it can sound like the sunny chirps of the brainwashed. Either one of these can lead to disaster. It's only the optimism that reasons, that considers courses of action and different potential outcomes, that pushes ahead, which truly leads to greatness. Naked optimism is the currency of casinos in Las Vegas. It's the attitude of overgrown children raised on large servings of phony self-esteem. It's the view of the world -- or of one's own talents -- that ignores the fact that everyone gets it wrong sometimes; that no matter how smart you are, there are always events that will remain out of your control, that there are always things you do not know, and there are always some people who are smarter than you. It's this kind of arrogance passing for self-confident optimism that gave us the economic mess we have had for the past five years. It's the optimism that falsely promised home prices could only go up, so we should borrow as much as possible, regardless of income; a confidence that boasted that complicated financial ideas and convoluted market hedging made for bulletproof Wall Street portfolios. We know where all that optimism took us. The ones who predicted disaster, the ones who saw a major collapse coming, were the ones who got it right. They were the ones who became superstars. Yes, sometimes the pessimists are right. But the optimists can learn from them. The action-oriented optimists, the ones who don't see life as a casino but as a place where one has to make the right decisions to obtain the desired outcomes -- to make the world a better place or our lives more worth living -- see disasters as occasions to learn, to find out what we should have done differently, to come up with new strategies. Scientists tell us that scans show our brains are wired for optimism. We register positive lessons more than negative ones. And that's partly, they say, because optimism is good for our health. Perhaps that's true. But science goes on, and scientists often change their minds. What is true now and always will be is that things don't always go the way we want. People don't always do what we would like. And life, like history, politics, the economy and the stock market, is full of surprises, including some very painful ones. So, we can't simply sit back and wait optimistically for everything to work out. We need to do our part to make the stories have happy endings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Scientists tell us optimism is good for us. Let's not be delusional .

"(CNN) -- Days of violent unrest in the Thai capital have left dozens dead and hundreds injured, as security forces clashed with anti-government protesters, with the demonstrators finally surrendering on Wednesday evening. Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday, as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks. The chaotic day left at least five people dead, as Bangkok residents endured an edgy and unsettled night. Wednesday's violent clashes cap a months-long standoff between Thai authorities and protesters opposed to the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. The protesters -- known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) -- support Thaksin Shinawatra, who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006, before he was ousted in a bloodless coup. What has happened up till now? The latest violence follows a government pledge to hold an election in November in an attempt to halt the protests. However, amid ongoing anger over a crackdown by security forces last month and a refusal by the protesters to comply with a deadline to vacate the district of Bangkok -- until Wednesday -- authorities say the election date is now under threat. Prime Minister Abhisit declared a state of emergency April 7, hours after anti-government demonstrators (known as ""Red Shirts"" for the clothes they wear) stormed the country's parliament. Following protests that have paralyzed parts of Bangkok for months, the army surged on Wednesday into Lumpini Park, with armored personnel carriers crushing bamboo and tire barricades, while protesters hurled M79 grenades at soldiers. Witnesses reported a dozen buildings -- including a bank, a police station, a local television station and Thailand's biggest shopping mall -- set ablaze. At least five people, including an Italian journalist, were listed as killed by the Police Hospital in Bangkok. Another 64 -- two journalists among them -- were wounded. What happens next? Thailand's prime minister sought to calm public fears with a televised address in which he expressed confidence that peace would soon be restored. ""I would like to give moral support to officers who are doing their duties now and would like to reassure you,"" Prime Minister Abhisit told citizens. ""And I am confident that we can overcome all the problems and bring the country to a long-lasting peace."" He said that the government had regained full control and that Red Shirt leaders had fled or had been taken into police custody. Seven anti-government protest leaders had been taken into custody, while several others fled, authorities said. The prime minister's office issued a statement Wednesday blaming the crackdown on failed talks between the two sides. ""Negotiations failed because core (opposition) leaders are not able to make decisions by themselves,"" the statement said, alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters. ""(We) ask core leaders to stop the rally and surrender."" On Wednesday, it seemed that the time for talking had passed. How long have protests being going on? Thailand has been embroiled in political chaos for years, and many Thai citizens are growing weary with the instability. Ever since Thaksin Shinawatra came to power in 2001, there were protesters opposing his allegedly corrupt and autocratic rule. Those protesters donned yellow shirts (the color of the king) and occupied the two main airports in Bangkok, until finally the pro-Thaksin government was brought down by a court ruling. In revenge Thaksin's supporters copied the yellow-shirt tactics with a variation, and took to the streets in red shirts. But the rift is largely between the Red Shirts and the so-called ""multi-colored shirts"" (who support Abhisit, the current prime minister). The multi-colored shirts, generally middle-class city dwellers, are displeased with the disruption caused by the protests. They are not pro- or anti-government. They simply want the government to shut down the Reds to end the violence and interruptions to daily life. Why do the sides identify themselves by colors? It's an easy way for them to create an identity. It all started with the Yellow Shirts wearing a color associated with Monday, the day of the week that Thailand's revered king was born on. That was designed to show their allegiance to the king and more broadly the traditional elite which has dominated Thai politics for years. Thaksin's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the Yellow Shirts. Why are they arguing? Essentially this is a classic power struggle. It's easy to portray this as simply rich against poor, but it is much more complicated than that, as illustrated by the fact that the Reds' leader is in fact a multi-billionaire. Thaksin rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor. His radical approach ruffled a lot of feathers among the elite, who felt he was becoming too big for his boots and feared his policies would erode their position. The ""civil society"" also become concerned over allegations of corruption and Thaksin's brutal war on drugs, which saw summary executions. He was also criticized for his heavy handed response to violence in the Muslim-dominated south. Finally, the army ousted Thaksin in a coup, which had the backing of the aristocratic elite and much of the middle class, who were becoming uneasy with the cult of personality growing around the leader. That set the stage for an embittered power struggle between Thaksin loyalists and those loyal to the army, aristocracy and their traditional Democrat Party. From his self-imposed exile abroad to avoid a trial on corruption charges, Thaksin released a statement Wednesday saying that he was not the leader of the United Front for Democracy, the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition, and that their movement calling for new elections is not on his behalf. ""They did not demand anything for me or on my behalf. I am not UDD,"" he said. Thaksin also accused the Thai government of defaming him by saying he was the mastermind behind the violence in the country's ongoing political crisis. So who is Thaksin? Visionary leader or venal despot: Opinions vary, like the color of the shirts his supporters and detractors wear. If you sport red, you think Thaksin was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits; if you wear yellow, you view him as opponents of the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos saw that leader: greedy and dangerous. What is not in dispute is that Thaksin won two elections, was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full-term in office and is still hugely popular. But critics say he bought his support and was only in politics to help himself. As a businessman, Thaksin made billions of dollars from his communications company, Shin Corporation. In 2008 he was found guilty and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for a land deal that enabled his wife to buy a valuable city plot for a fraction of its true value. Thaksin also faces other corruption charges. More than $2 billion in Thaksin's family assets are currently frozen in Thailand, but there is speculation he has a great deal more money elsewhere. What are the wider implications of the protests? If the divisions in Thailand can't be healed, it could lead to a deteriorating security situation which would have wider implications for the region. Thailand's relations with Cambodia are especially frosty, since Thaksin was appointed economic adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen. The worst case scenario would see Cambodia drawn into the dispute, with Thaksin using the country as a political base, adding to the already considerable tensions on the border. Is Thailand safe for visitors? Many western embassies have shut their doors and are warning their citizens against travel to Bangkok, as violence in the city continues. ""Due to escalating violence in central Bangkok, including gunfire near the U.S. Embassy, demonstrations in Chiang Mai, and other incidents throughout Thailand, U.S. citizens should defer all travel to Bangkok and defer all non-essential travel to the rest of Thailand,"" the U.S. State Department has warned. As well as advising against travel to Bangkok, the United Kingdom's Foreign Office warned of protests and violent incidents in popular tourist destinations such as Pattaya, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Ayutthaya. But Bangkok's main Suvarnabhumi airport is operating normally, according to its Web site.","November election date -- a government concession -- under threat .

"(CNN) -- America was rightly shocked by the brutal, videotaped murder of American journalist James Foley. But we should not have been surprised. The Islamic State, as the jihadist group calls itself, has murdered, raped and savaged its way across borders in the Mideast and into the headlines as the latest terrorist foe from the region. Foley's murder not only gives terrorist stature to ISIS but also, if it draws U.S. ground troops into the fight, will have given ISIS a recruiting bonanza. So the U.S. response requires, not just a set of airstrikes in revenge, but serious strategic calculation. The U.S. must build a coordinated regional response -- diplomatic, economic and military -- with ground troops from our regional allies and friends, and with possible U.S. support with intelligence, logistics and airstrikes. But we cannot fight this war for our Islamic friends in the region. Despite its pretensions, ISIS is not yet a state. It was initially a group of fighters funded, armed and assisted by groups or governments opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But its call for a caliphate governed by extremist interpretations of Sharia law precisely echoes Saudi Wahhabi teaching, and is magnetic to disaffected, vulnerable young people. Thus far ISIS has perhaps 20,000 to 40,000 fighters or more, some heavy equipment, cash, oil, and a stunned, subdued population numbering perhaps a few million now suffering under extreme Sharia law. It is not, at this point, an existential military threat to an alerted Baghdad, backed by Iran (and the U.S.), or the Kurds, supported by U.S. airpower. While it has challenged al-Assad's forces in Syria, it is more focused on carving out its territory in northern Syria, destabilizing Lebanon, and probably preparing for bolder moves against other states in the region, such as Jordan. Who is the ISIS? ISIS fighters, including perhaps a few thousand alienated young people from Europe, the Caucasus, or North America, do pose a terrorist threat far beyond the territory occupied by ISIS. Governments are anxiously screening travelers and seeking to block, intern, or otherwise isolate these potential terrorists when they depart Syria. This is difficult, but our homeland security is far stronger than it was a decade ago. The U.S., at least, should be able to handle this very serious threat . But if ISIS is allowed to consolidate its gains, build its forces, spread its tentacles of terror and subversion, then it will pose a serious threat to Lebanon, Jordan and the principal Sunni states in the region, particularly Saudi Arabia. Map: Where is ISIS? Saudi Arabia must recognize that it will eventually become the primary target of ISIS. It controls the most holy sites of Islam, and by its adherence to, promotion and export of extremist interpretations of Islam, Saudi Arabia is uniquely vulnerable to the ISIS's moral suasion. Massive purchases of Western arms will help only if the Saudi armed forces and populace remain loyal to the Saudi government. For Saudi Arabia, this time, there's no safety in underwriting the services of others from outside the region. Ultimately, it will have to be the Saudi people themselves, their ruling family and their clergy who rally to defeat the threat of ISIS. Make no mistake: The latent threat is that ISIS could seize control in Saudi Arabia, with all its oil, revenues, and modern weaponry. Therefore, coordinated action against ISIS is urgent. But because ISIS's motive force is primarily religious, and because the U.S. armed forces are neither linguistically nor culturally best adapted for a sustained fight in the region, we should be wary of committing major land forces. Opinion: How U.S. can help Syria drive out ISIS . The U.S. has learned the hard way that Western armies inflame extremists and serve as recruiting magnets for terrorists. Instead, other nations, and particularly Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states, must put their soldiers forward, and bear the brunt of the fighting. The U.S. can use diplomacy and economic assistance, and it can strike using airpower, or special forces, to reinforce the efforts of our allies, but we cannot fight a religious war as proxies for our Islamic friends in the region. 5 key questions in the fight against ISIS . The Mideast is approaching its moment of truth, particularly for Saudi Arabia. Having exported and promoted extremist Sunni religious ideology, Saudi Arabia must face up to the threat posed by its own, even more extremist progeny. It must summon the courage to take a firm stand now, before ISIS becomes even stronger. For the U.S. there is nothing to be gained by delay. We must work urgently, behind the scenes, to shape an effective regional response, in coordination with our friends and allies, now.","Wesley Clark: U.S. must respond to ISIS threat, but with coordinated regional response .
He says U.S. can support Islamic friends in region threatened by ISIS, but can't fight their war .
He says ISIS has sights on states like Jordan, Lebanon; it could well seize Saudi Arabia .
Clark: U.S. involvement only helps recruit jihadists. Mideast nations facing their moment of truth ."
"NEWTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- For Laura Geraghty, April 1, 2009, started out just as any other day. It was sunny but cool, she remembers. Laura Geraghty was shocked 21 times before she came back from cardiac arrest with tales of the afterlife. The mother of two, also a grandmother, was at her job, driving a school bus for the Newton Public School District in suburban Boston, Massachusetts. Her passengers, special-needs children, were wheelchair-bound. Seemingly in good health and in good spirits, Geraghty was finishing up her late-morning run, transporting a student and teacher back to Newton South High School, when she realized she was in trouble. As she was pulling into the school parking lot, she began having sharp stomach pains. She was able to park her bus, but she kept feeling worse. The pain ""went right up my arm and into my chest, and I said, 'Uh-oh, I'm having a heart attack,' "" she said. The teacher ran from the bus to get help. Newton South's nurse, Gail Kramer, and CPR instructor Michelle Coppola arrived moments later with the school's new automated external defibrillator. Geraghty, barely conscious, was fading fast. She was weak and having trouble breathing. And then she went into full cardiac arrest. ""Her eyes were wide, and all of a sudden she stopped talking to us,"" Coppola said. ""I grabbed the two pads, stuck them on her, started it up, and I'd say within 20 seconds, she had her first shock."" Coppola and Kramer performed CPR while they waited for paramedics.  See an expert give a quick lesson in CPR » . At that point, Geraghty says, her body died. She remembers watching the scene unfold -- as if from above. ""I floated right out of my body. My body was here, and I just floated away. I looked back at it once, and it was there."" Geraghty says she saw deceased loved ones, her mother and her ex-husband. ""It was very peaceful and light and beautiful. And I remember like, when you see someone you haven't seen in a while, you want to hug them, and I remember trying to reach out to my ex-husband, and he would not take my hand. And then they floated away."" Next, she says, she was overwhelmed by ""massive energy, powerful, very powerful energy."" ""When that was happening, there were pictures of my son and my daughter and my granddaughter, and every second, their pictures flashed in my mind, and then I came back."" What Geraghty had was a near-death experience, fairly common in people who go into sudden cardiac arrest. Geraghty was down for 57 minutes. No blood pressure, no pulse, no oxygen, no blood flow. She was shocked 21 times before she finally came back with tales of the afterlife. According to the Near Death Experience Research Foundation, nearly 800 near-death experiences happen every day in the United States. Dr. Kevin Nelson, a neurologist in Lexington, Kentucky, studies near-death experiences and says they're not imagined. The explanation, he says, lies in the brain itself. ""These are real experiences. And they're experiences that happen at a time of medical crisis and danger,"" Nelson said. Humans have a lot of reflexes that help keep us alive, part of the ""fight or flight"" response that arises when we're confronted with danger. Nelson thinks that near-death experiences are part of the dream mechanism and that the person having the experience is in a REM, or ""rapid eye movement,"" state. ""Part of our 'fight or flight' reflexes to keep us alive includes the switch into the REM state of consciousness,"" he said. During REM sleep, there is increased brain activity and visual stimulation. Intense dreaming occurs as a result. And the bright light so many people claim to see? ""The activation of the visual system caused by REM is causing the bright lights,"" Nelson said. And the tunnel people speak of, he says, is lack of blood flow to the eye. ""The eye, the retina of the eye, is one of the most exquisitely sensitive tissues to a loss of blood flow. So when blood flow does not reach the eye, vision fails, and darkness ensues from the periphery to the center. And that is very likely causing the tunnel effect."" Nelson is doing studies now to prove that the same effect results from fainting. ""The most common cause of near-death experience in my research group is fainting. Upwards of 100 million Americans have fainted. That means probably tens of millions of Americans have had these unusual experiences."" But Geraghty says this was no dream. ""I know I went someplace else. I know I went someplace else other than here."" Dr. Bill O'Callahan, the emergency room doctor who shocked her back to life, agrees. ""Cynics out there would say and agnostics would say that's phenomenon that comes from a dying brain. I think that's hogwash. I firmly believe that people experience these events."" Cheating Death: Back from the dead . Bob Schriever, co-founder of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association, was refereeing a high school football game seven years ago when he went into cardiac arrest, died and was revived. He, too, questions the dream explanation. ""Why are so many people dreaming the same thing? How can so many people, and there's hundreds of thousands of people who have experienced this, how can we all be dreaming the same thing and describe the exact same thing?"" Schriever says these experiences are so profound that only someone who has gone through them can truly understand. Seven years later, he is still consumed with his own near-death experience. ""I think about that every morning when I wake up, first thing, during the day, I don't know how many times and every night before I fall asleep. I think about that. People do not understand or appreciate what we go through."" Scientist uses poison gas to suspend life . For Geraghty, it's a daily struggle to put the pieces back together again. ""I've been someplace that not everybody can go, and there's not a lot of people you can sit down and have that conversation with,"" Geraghty said. ""My own daughter tells me, 'It's freaky, Mom.' I've literally lost friends over this the minute they hear it."" Tweet your own experience and you could win a copy of ""Cheating Death"" Geraghty says she became depressed once she left the hospital because her perspective on her entire life changed. She still gets depressed, she says, and is on medication. ""I actually went to my doctor and said to her, 'I think I'm losing my mind. This can't be really happening,' you know, and she said it's OK, it's very hard to understand when you've been through an experience like that."" Geraghty has joined the cardiac arrest group, hoping that connecting with others who understand what she's been through will allow her to come to terms with what happened to her that cool spring day six months ago. And allow her to heal and move on.","Woman whose heart stopped describes ""floating,"" seeing dead loved ones .

"(HLNtv.com) -- ""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson is ruffling feathers again, this time for comments he made years ago about how girls should marry when they're still teenagers. ""They got to where they're getting hard to find, mainly because these boys are waiting 'til they get to be about 20 years old before they marry 'em,"" Robertson says in a video clip that resurfaced Monday. ""Look, you wait 'til they get to be 20 years old, the only picking that's going to take place is your pocket. You got to marry these girls when they are about 15 or 16. They'll pick your ducks."" In the video, Robertson is recounting an anecdote at a speaking engagement. He describes the story as ""river rat counseling"" he was giving to a ""boy"" of unknown age and -- referring specifically to marrying teenage girls -- also advises the crowd to ""check with Mom and Dad about that, of course."" Robertson is four years older than his wife, Kay, whom he married when she was 16 years old, according to A&E's website. The reality show patriarch was speaking at a Georgia Sportsmen Ministry event when he recounted this advice, according to the video's description. The clip was originally posted in 2009 by YouTube user wakemakerducks, which is also the name of Robertson's company. It was posted again to YouTube on Monday. In the newly resurfaced footage, Robertson also lists other qualities he advised the boy to look for in a future wife. ""Make sure that she can cook a meal. You need to eat some meals that she cooks, check that out. Make sure she carries her Bible. That'll save you a lot of trouble down the road,"" he said. The resurfaced footage comes on the heels of controversy caused by comments regarding homosexuality that Robertson, 67, made to GQ magazine this month. ""It seems like, to me, a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man's anus,"" Robertson told GQ when opening up about topics he said he couldn't discuss on the show. ""That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical."" Robertson went on to explain to the magazine how he thinks that the line between right and wrong has been blurred and that ""sin becomes fine."" He then expanded on what, in his opinion, is ""sinful."" ""Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there,"" he said. ""Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."" A&E quickly suspended Robertson from filming future episodes of the hit show after he made those comments. Nine days later, the network reversed its decision.

"(CNN) -- The lyrics to the ""Friends"" theme song ""I'll Be There For You"" proved to be more than just words this week when actor David Schwimmer helped cops solve an alleged stabbing near his building. Schwimmer -- best known for his starring role as Ross Geller on the 10-year hit NBC show -- invited cops into his New York City townhouse Monday to view his surveillance video of a bloody brawl that took place in the adjacent apartment building, according to Sgt. Tom Antonetti of the NYPD. The dispute began at 5:48 a.m. on the first floor of an East Village apartment building involving three individuals regarding the theft of a computer, police said. The disagreement became physical and one of the individuals involved suffered stab wounds to the face, police said. The victim was treated at Bellevue Hospital, they said. The alleged stabber was arrested by police, but the third individual fled the scene, Antonetti said. Robert Rainey, 21, of Newark was charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and robbery, Antonetti said. Rainey also allegedly smashed a brick through the building's lobby window, said Antonetti. Police said that prior to viewing Schwimmer's footage, they only had the stories of those involved to rely on for evidence. It is unclear to what extent Schwimmer's video helped solve the case though. ""I am sure it contributed in some form or fashion to the investigation,"" Antonetti told CNN. Representatives for the actor did not immediately return calls to CNN.","Actor David Schwimmer shows police surveillance footage; helps in stabbing case .

"(CNN) -- In August 1974, editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association contacted the doctor who had developed a new method to save someone from choking -- then a major cause of death in the United States. His new technique was saving lives across the country, and they wanted to tell him they were publishing a story about it, and were going to name the procedure after him. Dr. Henry Heimlich says the editors told him they were considering the ""Heimlich Method"" or the ""Heimlich Maneuver."" ""I thought 'maneuver' sounded more appropriate,"" he says. On Tuesday, Heimlich, 94, released his autobiography, ""Heimlich's Maneuvers.'' In the story about his 70 years in public health, the sometimes controversial thoracic surgeon recounts his early experiments testing the Heimlich Maneuver on dogs, his life as a surgeon and researcher, and his time in the U.S. Navy stationed in China during World War II. ""Many people think I came up with the maneuver by accident,"" Heimlich says. ""You know, I happened to fall against someone who was choking, that kind of thing. I first seriously considered the problem of choking when I read about the thousands of people who die each year. So I set about researching a better way, thinking, perhaps I could make use of air trapped in the chest to propel the object out of the trachea."" Heimlich began experimenting on anesthetized dogs and tried to push the air out using different methods. He found when he pushed just below the rib cage, the object he had placed in the dog's throat shot out of its mouth every time. A maneuver was born. And that is mostly what the world knows about Heimlich. But in his autobiography, the doctor details other inventions and medical theories he is proud to have been a part of. In the early 1950s, Heimlich started looking at how to help patients who had lost their ability to swallow due to a damaged esophagus. He began replacing the damaged esophagus with a part of the patient's stomach. ""People who hadn't swallowed for decades -- who would feed themselves through a tube in the stomach -- were able to, for the first time, sit down with their family or go to a restaurant and eat normally,"" Heimlich said. During the Vietnam War, Heimlich invented a chest drain valve that allowed air and fluid to escape from the chest so that the patient's lung filled with air, helping many wounded soldiers on the battlefield waiting for care. Then in the 1980s, Heimlich invented the micro-trach transtracheal catheter, which allows people with serious lung conditions to receive oxygen more easily. ""I would like people to appreciate that ever since I decided to be a doctor I've wanted to help people,"" Heimlich says. ""I have seen people dying needlessly when in most cases, a simple technique was the solution."" But some of Heimlich's ideas have caused controversy in medical circles. Heimlich has argued his maneuver can be used for resuscitating drowning victims and for both acute and preventive treatment of asthma. The American Red Cross does not support using the maneuver for drowning. (Even for someone who's choking, the agency's first-aid procedure recommends first doing five back slaps and then five Heimlich abdominal thrusts.) Other experts have noted cases where performing the Heimlich Maneuver on a drowning victim did additional damage. As for asthma, medical experts have long questioned the maneuver's effectiveness as a treatment. In an article published in Modern Medicine in 1997, doctors noted that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation; while the Heimlich Maneuver may help clear mucous plugs that form in the lungs, it won't treat the inflammation that causes an attack. Only medication can do that. In China, Heimlich teamed up with local doctors to test another one of his theories: that malaria can be used to treat chronic Lyme disease, cancer and HIV. Put simply, Heimlich believes purposefully injecting patients with the deadly disease and letting it go untreated for a few weeks will strengthen patients' immune systems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opposes malarial therapy, and many medical experts have criticized Heimlich's testing methods, including his testing on human patients. Heimlich's son, Peter Heimlich, writes a blog, on which he has spent years trying to draw attention to his father's ""wide-ranging, unseen history of fraud."" Calling it a ""family issue,"" Heimlich doesn't talk about his son, but says there is evidence to back up all his ideas. Peter Heimlich has disputed his father's account that JAMA named the medical procedure after him. In response CNN contacted JAMA, but the journal was unable to verify or discount either Heimlich's claim. Henry Heimlich says there have been cases where individuals used the Heimlich Maneuver to save a drowning victim or stop an asthma attack, and stands by his own studies that he says show malaria therapy has promise in improving the lives of HIV/AIDS patients. ""All I am saying is that, before dismissing my ideas, let's at least study them to evaluate their efficacy."" What isn't up for debate is that choking can be deadly, and the Heimlich Maneuver has saved many lives. Heimlich estimates it has saved the lives of more than 50,000 people. ""There's been a lot of attention paid to the Heimlich Maneuver because it's so effective, but what I think makes it truly innovative is the fact that it's accessible to everyone. Anyone can save the life of a choking person -- even a child can perform the Heimlich Maneuver."" ""Heimlich's Maneuvers'' was published by Prometheus Books.","""Many people think I came up with the maneuver by accident,"" says Dr. Henry Heimlich .
In fact, the maneuver was developed after testing and experimenting on dogs .

"(CNN) -- Do not call Billy Bob Thornton an actor when you are interviewing him about his music. Billy Bob Thornton's interview on a Canadian radio show is garnering lots of attention. A Canadian radio host learned that lesson when Thornton and his electric hillbilly band -- the Boxmasters -- visited his Toronto, Ontario, studio Wednesday morning. When Jian Ghomeshi introduced the trio on his CBC show, he noted that its singer-songwriter-drummer was also an ""Oscar-winning screenwriter-actor-director."" Thornton's publicist, Arnold Robinson, disputes suggestions that what followed was a breakdown by the actor -- hmmm, musician. He ""simply elected not to engage with the interviewer because of the direction of the interview from the outset,"" Robinson told CNN. Thornton took the reference to his movie career as an insult to his musical endeavor. The radio interview, which also was recorded on video, may leave the audience wondering whether this was a controlled performance by Thornton or a public breakdown that revealed true anger over a perceived insult of his music.  Watch the interview with the actor-musician head south » . In their first exchange, Thornton stonewalled his questioner: . Ghomeshi: Billy Bob, you guys formed only in the last couple years, right? Thornton: I don't know what you're talking about. Ghomeshi: How so? Thornton: I don't know what you mean by that. Ghomeshi: When did the band form? Thornton: I'm not sure what that means. Guitarist J.D. Andrew briefly rescued Ghomeshi by confirming the group came together two years ago. The Boxmasters are on tour opening for Willie Nelson, which prompted Ghomeshi's next question directed at Thornton. Ghomeshi: What do you learn from Willie Nelson, Billy Bob? Thornton: I've never met him . Ghomeshi: (laughing) Are you being ironic, or are you being serious? Thornton: I don't really know him. Ghomeshi: You've never met Willie Nelson? Thornton: I said hello to him once. He's a nice guy. Thornton's band mates talked about how their music was a mix of Southern hillbilly influences and the 1960s British rock invasion. Ghomeshi tried to draw Thornton into the conversation again. Ghomeshi: And that was true for you, Billy Bob, growing up it was sort of a combo of Stones and Monkees and Buck Owens? Thornton: I just liked baseball when I was a kid. Ghomeshi: And you almost became a professional baseball player, right? Thornton: I don't know. Maybe. Ghomeshi: But you didn't love music when you were a kid? Thornton: I subscribed to a magazine called Famous Monsters in Filmland, which the publisher was a guy named Forrest J. Ackerman, who passed away recently. The interviewer then asked Thornton if he remembered what music he listened to as a kid, but he rambled on about a monster model contest the magazine sponsored. Thornton said he entered but did not win. The tension came to a head when Ghomeshi asked Thornton if his bizarre answers were a reaction to his brief reference to his movie career. Ghomeshi: You would prefer me to only do this interview not mentioning at all, just to clarify, at all that you've ever done anything in terms of acting, screenwriting. Thornton: That's correct. Ghomeshi: Part of the attention that you are getting is because of the great career you've had in other ways. What I'm explaining is I'm not trying to be insulting to your musical. ... Thornton: What I'm explaining is that we said do not talk about s**t like that. And we also said that we didn't want to hear anything about how this is my first love. You wouldn't say that to Tom Petty, would you? ""I understand music is your first love."" Well, my first love was a chick named Lisa Cone. You know what I mean? The two men then declared a truce so they could finally talk about the music Thornton called ""cosmic cowboy music."" No matter how good of a singer and drummer Thornton may be, his ability to create memorable characters is remarkable, as evidenced by his Oscar-nominated role of Karl, the mentally impaired convict in ""Sling Blade.""

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who spilled U.S. surveillance secrets to the world, is a ""free man"" biding his time in a Moscow airport, Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters Tuesday. Putin said Snowden -- who flew to Moscow from Hong Kong on Sunday -- is in the ""transit area"" of Sheremetyevo International Airport, the zone between arrival gates and Russia's passport control checkpoints. While he said Russia won't hand Snowden over to the United States, he seemed eager to have the focus of international intrigue off his hands. ""The sooner he selects his final destination point, the better both for us and for himself,"" Putin said from Finland of Snowden, who is wanted by U.S. officials on espionage charges for disclosing classified details of U.S. surveillance programs. Putin's comments end, for now at least, the international pastime of ""Where's Snowden?"" There have been rumors for days that the former NSA contractor had perhaps duped the world into thinking he was in Moscow to throw pursuers off his trail as he seeks a safe haven from U.S. prosecution. Kristinn Hrafnsson -- a spokesman for WikiLeaks, an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information and has one of its members with Snowden in Russia -- told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday only that Snowden ""is in a safe place and is comfortable and possibly simply relaxing after a very stressful week."" Read more: Dozens of journalists heading for Cuba ... without Snowden . Noting the United States and Russia do not have an extradition agreement, Putin said Snowden can't be turned over to U.S. authorities and has committed no crimes on Russian soil. But he also said Russian security forces have not been ""working with"" Snowden and expressed hope that the incident would not ""affect the cordial nature of our relations with the U.S."" Hrafnsson offered a similar story, saying there's been ""no cooperation or coordination with the Russian authority"" before or since Snowden arrived in Moscow. A senior Obama administration official called Putin's comments ""potentially positive"" while reiterating hopes that Snowden would be expelled from Russia and returned to the United States. U.S. officials believe Russian authorities have a ""clear legal basis to expel Mr. Snowden, based on the status of his travel documents and the pending charges against him,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking to reporters while traveling in Saudi Arabia, said the United States isn't looking to Russia to enforce U.S. law, only to ""allow him to be subject to the laws of our land and our Constitution."" ""We are not looking for confrontation, we're not ordering anybody,"" Kerry said. ""We're simply requesting under a very normal procedure for the transfer of somebody, just as we transferred to Russia seven people in the last two years that they requested, that we did without any clamor, without any rancor, without any argument and according to our sense of the appropriateness of meeting their request."" Snowden left Hong Kong on Sunday after a couple of weeks spent doling out details of classified U.S. intelligence programs to journalists. With his passport revoked by U.S. officials, Snowden traveled out of the semiautonomous Chinese territory on refugee papers issued by Ecuador, one of the countries from which he is seeking asylum. International tiff . His travels have sparked international dust-ups, with U.S. officials accusing China of making a ""deliberate choice"" to let Snowden go free and criticizing Russia for failing to hand him over in a spirit of international cooperation. Measured tones mask Washington's fury with Hong Kong over Snowden . On Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman rejected the U.S. claims as ""unreasonable,"" according to the official Xinhua news service. ""The accusation that the U.S. side made against the Central Government of China fell short of proof. The Chinese side will absolutely not accept it,"" spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung, Hong Kong's justice secretary, likewise denied that authorities there intentionally let Snowden leave before acting on U.S. requests. ""All along, we acted fully in accordance with the law and any suggestion that we have been deliberately letting Mr. Snowden go away or to do any other thing to obstruct the normal operation is totally untrue,"" Yuen said Tuesday. Authorities in Hong Kong were seeking answers from U.S. authorities around when Snowden left, the justice secretary added. Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying said Monday that authorities acted independently from Beijing ""to follow procedural fairness and procedural justice."" In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the U.S. complaints ""absolutely groundless and unacceptable."" ""I want to say, right away, that we have nothing to do with Mr. Snowden or his movements around the world,"" Lavrov said. The White House is eager to avoid a repeat of what happened in Hong Kong, where authorities let Snowden leave despite a U.S. request for his arrest and extradition. Washington has described that move as a ""serious setback"" to building trust between the United States and China. Lawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as Snowden lands in Russia . But the Obama administration doesn't have much leverage with Moscow, said Matthew Rojansky, an expert on U.S. and Russian national security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""We really need Russian cooperation, I think, much more in most areas than the Russians need us,"" he said. 4 options for the U.S. to get Snowden back . U.S. diplomatic headache . Washington is also telling other countries where Snowden might end up -- notably Ecuador, which says it's analyzing an asylum request from Snowden -- that they should hand him over if he lands on their soil. They note that his U.S. passport has been revoked. ""The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States,"" Carney said. One rumored destination is Venezuela, whose leaders have been frequently at odds with Washington in recent years. According to the AVN state news agency, President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday his country has not received a formal request for political asylum from Snowden. But if it did, the government would consider it on humanitarian grounds, the agency reports. In its quest to get Snowden, the United States has limited options. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now ""is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter."" ""In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around,"" Toobin said. ""But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules."" The leak controversy . Snowden has acknowledged he leaked classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and The Washington Post. The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of people overseas residents. The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties. Snowden worked as a Hawaii-based computer network administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor, before he fled to Hong Kong last month with laptops full of confidential information. The South China Morning Post newspaper published a story Monday quoting Snowden as saying he took the job to gather evidence on U.S. surveillance programs. He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government. Carney questioned Snowden's assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency, saying his argument ""is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- China, Russia, Ecuador."" ""His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States, not to advance Internet freedom and free speech,"" Carney told reporters. Snowden's search . Snowden is seeking asylum from Ecuador, Iceland and other, unspecified countries, a WikiLeaks attorney said Monday. Interactive: En route with Snowden . Ecuador has already given WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange freedom if he can find a way out of the country's embassy in London. In his aslyum request read by Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo, Snowden compared himself to Pvt. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks. He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement, and he predicted a similar ""cruel and unusual"" fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands. Snowden has come under some criticism for seeking out help from nations with questionable histories on free speech and press freedom. For instance, The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa's government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms, calling its policies increasingly repressive. Snowden isn't looking for ""political nirvana,"" said Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for the Guardian who broke his revelations. ""He's searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate, and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen,"" Greenwald told CNN's ""The Lead."" Some have speculated Snowden has ""doomsday insurance"" in the form of even more top-secret U.S. documents that will go public if he's ever detained by U.S. authorities. Hrafnsson, the WikiLeaks spokesman, said he didn't know about Snowden's specific plans, but did suggest more secrets may be revealed. ""This is simply information that should be out in the public,"" he said. ""There is more to come."" CNN's Greg Botelho, Phil Black, Matt Smith, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jill Dougherty, Carol Cratty, Nic Robertson and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Snowden is safe and ""possibly simply relaxing,"" WikiLeaks spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Internet shoppers could be one step closer to having to pay sales taxes on online purchases. In a vote on Monday, the U.S. Senate passed the Marketplace Fairness Act, which will require all online retailers to collect sales taxes for the states where they ship goods. The legislation still needs to pass the Republican-controlled House before it can become a law. White House spokesman Jay Carney has said that President Obama supports the bill. Why is there no online sales tax now? Until now, online shoppers have enjoyed buying items from e-commerce sites mostly sales-tax free. That's because older laws require stores to collect sales tax only on goods shipped to states where they have a physical presence, such as a distribution center or a physical store. The primary reason for not requiring sales taxes for products sold across state lines is that it was just too complicated. Having to juggle the various sales tax laws and amounts for all 45 states that have sales tax was seen as a burden on businesses. States that collect sales tax often have different rates depending on the type of goods being sold. Alcohol might have a higher sales tax rate while some goods like groceries dental equipment can be tax free. Within a state, cities and counties can charge additional taxes. What's changed? The most recent Supreme Court ruling that addressed the issue was in 1992, when Internet commerce was non-existent and computer software not as advanced. Advocates for the online sales tax argue that current technology makes it possible to simplify and automate the task of collecting sales taxes for various states. Under the Marketplace Fairness Act, state governments that want to collect the tax will have to provide companies with free software for calculating taxes and set up one state entity to receive the payment. Wait, aren't we required to pay sales tax already? In most states with sales taxes, people who buy goods online (or over the phone or through the mail) from another state are subject to a Use Tax. They are supposed to keep track of everything they purchase and pay sales taxes when they file their tax return. Many consumers either ignore or are not aware of these requirements, and states say it is difficult to enforce. Because people are already technically required to pay for unpaid sales tax, proponents of the bill argue that it isn't a new tax at all but a more efficient way of enforcing existing tax laws. Who wants this tax? The bill's supporters include big box retailers like Target, the National Retail Federation, e-commerce powerhouse Amazon, small brick and mortar business, a mix of Republicans and Democrats and President Obama. Proponents say it will level the playing field for online and physical stores. Large retailers like Target have physical stores in most states and are already required to collect sales taxes for online sales. They argue that online-only retailers have an unfair advantage. Until recently, Amazon was firmly against the online sales tax. But as the retailer has grown it's become interested in expanding its physical operations into more states, paving the way for faster and same-day delivery of goods. Now the company is a big supporter of the law, which will help it stay competitive against other online-only retailers as it moves into more states. Who's against it? Online marketplace eBay is leading the charge against the tax, which could impact its many sellers who do more than $1 million in out-of-state business annually. In a letter to eBay sellers, CEO John Donahoe suggested the law should exempt any business with fewer than 50 employees or that make less than $10 million a year on out-of-state sales. Conservatives and anti-tax activists are also against the law and claim it will hurt online businesses. Smaller businesses that make more than the $1 million threshold claim it could still be costly to integrate a new accounting system, even with the proposed simplifications. How much money will this bring in? There were $225.5 billion in online sales in 2012, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. States lost out on a combined $23 billion in uncollected sales tax revenue, according to estimates from the National Conference of State Legislators. What about states with no sales tax? Five states currently have no statewide sales tax: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. People who live in a state without sales tax won't be charged on goods they have shipped to their home state. However, businesses based in these states will have to collect sales taxes for items shipped to other places where there are sales taxes. How much will I pay? People in states that do have sales tax will pay the same amount of sales tax as you would buying an item in person at a local store. Sales tax rates are complicated and vary according to the type of product. To find out how much something will cost under this new law, choose a location and tax category on Tax Cloud's interactive map. It will be possible to avoid sales taxes by buying from small out-of-state retailers making less than $1 million a year and not reporting use taxes when you file taxes. When will it go into effect? You don't need to start stockpiling goods from your favorite online stores just yet. There are still a few hurdles before states can start collecting sales tax on online purchases. The earliest it could go into effect is October 1, 2013. After the vote on Monday, the bill will have to pass the House where it could face more resistance that it did in the Senate. If it does become a law, individual states will still have to meet some requirements before they can compel companies to pay state sales tax. They must simplify their tax processes and creating a single entity for collecting state taxes. Twenty two states have already begun the process as part of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, which is a move by states to simplify their tax laws and regulations.","The Senate on Monday approved an online sales tax .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by outed spy Valerie Plame and her husband against Vice President Dick Cheney and other top Bush administration officials. A judge threw out the lawsuit from ex-spy Valerie Plame and husband Joseph Wilson. Plame had accused members of the Bush administration of leaking her identity. To knowingly disclose classified information to unauthorized recipients is a crime, and Plame's position was classified. U.S. District Judge John Bates said the lawsuit raises ""important questions relating to the propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials."" But in a 41-page decision, he found Plame and her husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, failed to show the case belongs in federal court. Plame's identity as a CIA operative was exposed in July 2003 after Wilson publicly challenged a key argument in the Bush administration's case for the invasion of Iraq. The couple argued the disclosure destroyed her career and was done to retaliate against Wilson, who said the administration had ""twisted"" the evidence used to justify the invasion.  CIA leak timeline » . Bates, a Bush appointee, agreed with defense arguments that federal law protects Cheney and the other top administration officials from being sued for actions taken as part of their official duties. The way the defendants handled criticism from Joseph Wilson ""may have been highly unsavory,"" the judge wrote, but ""there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism ... by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level executive branch officials."" Valerie Plame's exposure ignited a criminal probe that led to I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby's conviction in March on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to federal agents investigating the leak. President Bush commuted Libby's 30-month prison term earlier this month, calling it ""excessive,"" but let the verdicts stand. Melanie Sloan, the Wilsons' lawyer, said the couple plans to appeal Thursday's ruling. ""While we are obviously very disappointed by today's decision, we have always expected that this case would ultimately be decided by a higher court. ... We disagree with the court's holding and intend to pursue this case vigorously to protect all Americans from vindictive government officials who abuse their power for their own political ends,"" she said in a statement. Joseph Wilson said the decision was ""just the first step in what we have always known would be a long legal battle."" ""This case is not just about what top government officials did to Valerie and me,"" he said in a statement issued to reporters. ""We brought this suit because we strongly believe that politicizing intelligence ultimately serves only to undermine the security of our nation."" Lea Ann McBride, Cheney's spokeswoman, said ""the vice president is pleased that the court has dismissed the lawsuit."" The Libby defense team declined to comment. Libby, with his appeal still pending, has deferred to defense attorney Ted Wells to speak for the Libby family. Barbara Comstock, a spokeswoman, told CNN ""there will be no statement."" In addition to Libby and Cheney, the lawsuit also named former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Karl Rove, Bush's top political adviser. During the course of the leak probe, Rove and Armitage were found to have been the two ""senior administration officials"" columnist and former CNN contributor Robert Novak cited in identifying Plame as a CIA operative. Both cooperated with special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation, and neither was charged with a crime.

"Washington (CNN) -- The state dinner is Washington's top fete. And over the years, the Obama administration has weathered the party crashing Salahis â€” an incident which launched congressional scrutiny of White House security -- and a dinner-canceling snub from the Brazilian President last year after learning the United States was spying on her government. This White House has preferred to pare the pageantry in favor of quieter dinners with other world leaders. After all, state affairs, like the one set for Tuesday night for French President Francois Hollande, are glitzy and require huge guest lists and stodgier protocols. In fact, the Obamas have hosted just six state dinners, which is about the same number as George W. Bush. Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush threw more than 20, and Ronald Reagan hosted 35. Nonetheless, the state dinner, a tradition formalized under Ulysses S. Grant, is still a highly coveted social soiree. Here's the scoop: . Getting the details right: The White House social secretaries, State Department chief of protocol, first lady's office and others all work together to ensure that everything from culturally appropriate menus are prepared and customs honored. During the Obama's first state dinner for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh guests ate red lentil soup with fresh cheese and a choice of entrees -- roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chick peas and okra for vegetarians, or green curry prawns, among other items. Tables were adorned with magnolia branches -- from species native to both India and the United States. Of course, this is also the party that Michaele and Tareq Salahi managed to attend without an invitation, so sometimes details slip through the cracks. The attire: State dinners are black tie affairs complete with tuxedos and designer gowns. New York-based designer Naeem Khan created a one of a kind strapless gold and silver gown which first lady Michelle Obama donned during the administration's first state dinner. For her first state dinner former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy wore ""wore a Grecian-style gown of pale yellow silk organza touched with brilliants,"" according to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. Not all of the attendees are fans of formal attire. Nikita Khrushchev, then-leader of the former Soviet Union, famously refused to wear tie and tails to the state dinner thrown in his honor by President Dwight Eisenhower. ""My husband would just as soon dress that way, too, if I'd let him,"" Mamie Eisenhower reportedly said. The setting: Well, the State Dining Room at the White House, of course. Tables are adorned with fine linen, china from presidencies past are often used, and the room is lit by gilded candelabras and chandeliers. Often, as in tonight's fete, dinners are hosted in a large white tent on the South Lawn of the White House. The event is sort of the wonk world's red carpet event and guests stream past a sea of cameras. The movie, ""The Butler,"" a loosely factual account of the life Eugene Allen, a butler at the White House for 34 years and through eight administrations, shows Allen and his wife attending a state dinner hosted by the Reagans for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Scoring an invite: If you have to ask, you're probably not on the list. The list is culled from recommendations from the President and first lady, top government officials, the Pentagon, members of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the State Department. Hollywood stars and community and business leaders are also often asked to attend. According to the White House website on state dinners, ""Behind the festive exterior of the social scene, the important business of government goes on -- information is gathered -- opinions exchanged -- powerful connections made and appearances upheld. For these reasons White House invitations are the most important and the most sought after in the nation's social whirl."" A seat at the table: In the 1960s, Mrs. Kennedy dispensed with the long banquet tables of her predecessors in favor of round tables designed to give all guests an equal opportunity to rub elbows. It is a tradition that subsequent administrations have kept. The music: During the Obama administration state dinner guests have enjoyed music from such artists as BeyoncÃ©, Rodrigo y Gabriela, John Legend and British folk-rockers Mumford & Sons. On Tuesday night, Mary J. Blige will entertain.","White House state dinners have a storied history .

"(CNN) -- At least 55 people have drowned or are missing after a boat capsized off the Somali coast on Tuesday evening, the United Nations Refugee Agency said Thursday in a statement. Ethiopians and Somalis were on the boat. Twenty-three of the 55 victims have been recovered, the agency said. The dead include more than a dozen women and a boy believed to be about 4. The incident marks the largest loss of life in the Gulf of Aden since February 2011, when 57 Somali refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa drowned while attempting to reach Yemen. Five survivors told refugee agency representatives that the boat was overcrowded and started having trouble soon after leaving the port of Bosasso in northern Somalia on Tuesday. It's capsized 15 minutes into its journey. At least 100,000 people have crossed the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden this year, despite warnings from U.N. and aid agencies about the risks of those kind of trips. Before Tuesday's incident, 95 people had drowned or gone missing this year in the waters between Somalia and Yemen.","United Nations Refugee Agency says 55 people are drowned or missing .

"(CNN) -- At Thursday's Capitol Hill confirmation hearing, Chuck Hagel will finally get to answer his critics. The decorated Vietnam veteran and two-term Republican senator from Nebraska is President Obama's choice to be the next secretary of defense. But the bipartisan pick hasn't brought the two parties together. Instead, a cadre of conservative activists have been trying to drum up opposition to Hagel ever since his name was first floated in what has amounted to a pre-emptive attack on not just his policies but, too often, his character. It's time for a reality check. The anti-Hagel campaign has accused him of being everything from ""out of the mainstream"" to anti-Israel to anti-Semitic to anti-gay -- serious charges, if true. Politics: Five things Hagel may be asked . But let's be honest: Hagel's cardinal sin among neo-conservatives was his outspoken opposition to Bush-era foreign policy in Iraq and his decision to break Republican ranks and not support the 2007 Iraq surge. Good people can disagree on policy and personnel; my wife and I disagree on the Hagel nomination. A confirmation hearing can usefully clear up any sincere questions. But a look at the facts, armed with a sense of perspective, suggests that it might be Hagel's most vociferous critics who are outside the historic mainstream, not Hagel himself. Hagel's unvarnished independence is well-known in Washington, but his opposition to the quagmire of the Iraq war is not idiosyncratic. It is philosophically consistent with being a small government conservative and a Vietnam veteran, suspicious of calls to war by people who won't have to serve in the combat zone. He still carries shrapnel in his chest from being wounded in Vietnam. After his war service, he said, ""I made myself a promise that if I ever got out of that place and was ever in a position to do something about war -- so horrible, so filled with suffering -- I would do whatever I could to stop it. I have never forgotten that promise."" This doesn't mean Hagel is some kind of pacifist. But as the first enlisted man to serve in combat to be nominated for secretary of defense, he does have a grunt's-eye view of war and a commitment to making it a last resort, consistent with our national interest -- hence his reasonable regrets about the invasion of Iraq and his caution about charging into a war with Iran. Politics: McCain moves from backer to skeptic on Hagel . ""We blundered into Iraq because of flawed intelligence, flawed assumptions, flawed judgments, and ideologically driven motives,"" he wrote in his 2008 memoir, ""America: Our Next Chapter: Tough Questions, Straight Answers."" ""We must not repeat these errors with Iran and the best way to avoid them is to maintain an effective dialogue. Preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon is in the interest of both the United States and the world community."" He also repeatedly calls Iran a state sponsor of terrorism. As part of the effort to contain Iran's ambitions, Hagel believes that multilateral sanctions are more effective than unilateral sanctions, a belief largely borne out by experience. This policy disagreement is worthy of debate, but it is far from a disqualification. In 2012, Hagel co-wrote an opinion piece with a bipartisan group of former congressmen and military leaders on stopping Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. It said, ""our position is fully consistent with the policy of presidents for more than a decade of keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force, thereby increasing pressure on Iran while working toward a political solution."" This policy is common sense, consistent with that of both President Bush and Obama, and entirely within the mainstream. And yet, the accusation that Hagel is out of the mainstream on Iran and Israel percolates because it is in the talking points. An early broadside came from The Weekly Standard, which published an anonymous e-mail, allegedly from a Senate aide, reading, ""Send us Hagel and we will make sure every American knows he is an anti-Semite."" This is a serious accusation and a transparent attempt to intimidate. Anti-Semitism is a rightfully toxic charge. Israel is America's closest ally in the world, along with the UK. But in a recent interview with his hometown paper in Lincoln, Nebraska, Hagel said that his record demonstrates ""unequivocal, total support for Israel."" In his memoir, Hagel devotes an entire chapter to ""The Holy Land: Israel and The Arabs,"" full of calls for negotiated peace with statements like this: ""There is one important given that is not negotiable: A comprehensive solution should not include any compromise regarding Israel's Jewish identity, which must be assured. The Israeli people must be free to live in peace and security."" For what it's worth, five former ambassadors to Israel have endorsed Hagel's nomination, and former Israeli Consul Gen. Alon Pinkas has clarified that Hagel is ""not anti-Israel."" Politics: Why some conservatives are still going after Hagel . The anti-gay charge has been pushed by the Log Cabin Republicans as well as some liberal groups for Hagel's opposition to Bill Clinton's 1998 nomination of the openly gay James Hormel to serve as ambassador of Luxembourg. At the time, Hagel questioned the wisdom of having an ""openly, aggressively gay"" ambassador -- a statement that reflects the unevolved times on this issue. Hagel has since apologized. Christopher Barron of the gay conservative group GOProud questioned the RNC's aggressive promotion of this line of attack, tweeting, ""The RNC website uses the Hagel is anti-gay smear, anyone told them to take a look at the GOP platform recently?"" The final reality check relates to the conservative senators who have criticized their former colleague. In 2006, John McCain said he'd be ""honored to have Chuck with me in any capacity. He'd make a great secretary of state."" But after Hagel was nominated by Obama, McCain questioned Hagel's ""overall attitude toward the United States and the world."" Republican leader Mitch McConnell also broadly praised Hagel as recently as 2009, saying, ""Chuck has earned the respect of his colleagues and risen to national prominence as a clear voice on foreign policy and national security."" This generous perspective is unlikely to be recollected by conservatives during the confirmation hearings. Since his nomination, Hagel has been diligently working the corridors of Congress, trying to address concerns directly. He's also met with leaders of organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to address the accusations behind closed doors. Consider the attacks on Hagel against the backdrop of facts, with a sense of perspective. And then look at the staunch defenders of Hagel's nomination: Republican Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Republican Secretary of State Colin Powell, Reagan's respected Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci and the first President Bush's national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. The bottom line: Chuck Hagel is squarely in the Main Street Republican tradition. That he is being relentlessly attacked by some neoconservatives reflects how much their ""you're either with us or against us"" attitude has strayed out of the historic mainstream. Listen: Hagel's other war . Policy differences can and should be debated, but stooping to personal smears smacks of desperation. It is doubly ironic because Hagel's appointment by a Democratic president is designed to help re-center American foreign policy, reminding us all of some forgotten Cold War era wisdom articulated by Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg during the Truman administration: ""Partisan politics ought to end at the water's edge."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Critics targeted Hagel since he was nominated for secretary of defense .

"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (CNN) -- To feel the vibrancy of Ho Chi Minh City, all you have to do is step out onto a bustling city street. Step to it: Walking through the city's streets is the best way to see it. Negotiating the roads, chock full of motorbikes and an increasing number of cars, can be daunting. But copy the fearless locals -- they don't break stride and never retreat -- and put your fate in the hands, or throttle, of the city's drivers who seems masterful at avoiding each other. A good place to kick off a visit is on one of the main drags, Le Loi, a street that runs through the heart of the city. Near one end is the picturesque Opera House, as well as the majestic City Hall or ""People's Committee Building"" (this is still a communist country of course). You shouldn't have to do too much motorbike dodging down Lei Loi and after just a 15 minute stroll from City Hall is the famed Cho Ben Thanh Market. However give yourself more time to stop into galleries or buy a classic piece of communist propaganda along the way. The hundreds of stalls at Cho Ben Thanh offer a mix of traditional culture and tourist kitsch. You can sit with the locals and sip a solid jolt of Vietnamese coffee then move on to shopping for touristy T-shirts and ""authentic chopsticks"". Many of the stalls feature signs saying the prices are fixed. But if you're prepared to drive a hard bargain, or buy in bulk, that idea can be amended. It's also worth a return trip later on in the evening when the market closes and street side restaurants spring up, offering great meals at cheap prices. If you're looking to get away from the strip of Western hotels in the city center, hail a cab and head over to Cholon, or Ho Chi Minh City's Chinatown. In the late 18th century, this enclave was actually a separate city from old Saigon but the two were united in the early 1930's. Today Cholon is home to the Binh Tay Market, which the locals call ""Cho Lon."" Just don't confuse it with Ben Thanh, or you'll be right back where you started. The area is filled with plenty of local color and is a photographer's dream. Despite mass consumption of bottled water and the finest sunscreen, you'll need to find a way to beat the heat in Ho Chi Minh City. One of the best ways is to make regular stops at any restaurant or café for a refreshing lime soda. A bowl of the traditional Pho (pronounced ""fuh"") is also a must. It's said that this simple dish -- consisting of noodles, beef and broth -- was created at food stalls in Hanoi nearly a century ago. But even in Ho Chi Minh you need to walk only a few feet before coming across a food joint claiming to serve the city's best Pho. In a place with stifling heat and the motorbike madness, an afternoon rest is a wise move, especially if you want to partake in the nightlife. Another dose of Vietnamese coffee will surely have you revived in no time. Or, if you're in need of some pampering, try a foot massage at any of the countless establishments -- to play it safe and avoid ""additional services"" get a suggestion from any hotel concierge. Is Ho Chi Minh City the most exciting city in Asia for a short break? Have you say in the ""Sound Off"" box below. If you're keen to try to play foreign correspondent -- or at least see where they gathered during the days of the Vietnam War - look no further than the Rex Hotel on Nguyen Hue Boulevard. The drinks are wildly overpriced and the crowd seems to be on the ""5 Asian Cities in 7 Days"" tour, but its large rooftop does offer a great bird's eye view of the lively streets below. The nearby Temple Club on Ton That Thiep Street offers a quieter setting for a cocktail. Diners also give great reviews for the food. Afterwards, stroll over to Vasco's on Hai Ba Trung Street. The French colonial style building features bands playing away upstairs with large lounges on the veranda, while downstairs you can settle in for a more mellow night. If your 24 hours in Ho Chi Minh City happens to turn into 36 or 48, arrange a day trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels, about 70 kilometers Northwest of the city. The Viet Cong built this maze of passageways, which served as supply lines, during the Vietnam War. The narrow tunnels snake underground for a staggering 200 kilometers. Not only can you take a stroll, or crawl, through a few parts of it, you'll also be served a unique dose of communist propaganda. Most trips to Cu Chi also include a stop at the very colorful and unique Cao Dai Temple in Tay Ninh. If these options don't hit the mark, you can always accept an offer from one of the countless ""moto drivers."" They'll have you on the back of their bike and whizzing through the streets in no time. Just hold on tight. And maybe close your eyes.","The city is buzzing with motorbikes, so be quick to get up to speed .

"(CNN) -- Peruvian President Alan Garcia said Saturday that ""dark political interests"" were responsible for the recent deadly outbreak of violence in the southern department of Puno. ""What they are looking to do is pressure the next government of President (Ollanta) Humala,"" the outgoing president told reporters. ""There are dark political interests here that are demanding power."" Humala, elected this month, is scheduled to take office on July 28. Garcia spoke the same day the Peruvian government agreed to put an end to a private mining project in Puno, following the deaths of five protesters in clashes with police on Friday. The decision followed more than 10 hours of talks between government ministers and indigenous Aymara leaders as the two sides tried to put an end to an indefinite strike that has gripped Puno for a month. The protests are against mining and drilling concessions in the region. On Saturday, a repeal of a 2007 decree that gave permission for the silver mine in Puno was officially repealed. As a result, operations at the Santa Ana mine, owned by the Canadian Bear Creek Mining Corporation, were canceled. Also, the deal gives local indigenous communities the power to approve or deny any mining or drilling operations in the area. ""If the communities don't want mining, it can't be forced,"" said Fernando Gala, vice minister of mines. The agreement could also affect existing concessions in Puno, he said. The move comes after five people were killed and 25 injured in clashes with police as protesters tried to take over Manco Capac International Airport in the Puno city of Juliaca. ""Sadly, these are human lives and we have to sympathize with what happened,"" said Cabinet chief Rosario Fernandez. She called for residents of Puno and two other areas where violent protests have taken hold -- Huancavelica and Huancayo -- to restore calm and assume an attitude of ""democracy and dialogue."" While she regretted the deaths of the protesters in Puno, she said the government would act as needed to restore peace. The mining of metals is one of Peru's leading industries, and a major revenue source for Peruvian departments with such natural resources. According to the mine ministry, Puno receives 700 million soles ($250 million) annually from the government, of which about 40% is from mining royalties. The canceling of the Santa Ana mine could cost Puno some 25 million soles ($9 million) in royalties, Gala said.","NEW: The violence unfolds a month before a new president is to be sworn in .

"(CNN) -- Moments after the explosion, as he lay in a canal in rural Afghanistan, Cpl. Todd Nicely screamed twice at the top of his lungs. He was hurt so badly, his right leg blown away, his left one barely hanging on, but then he thought of two things. His wife and his men. He didn't think of dying. He wanted to concentrate on getting home, and before that, he didn't want his squad's last image to be its leader wailing in pain. ""I just [told myself] keep breathing, keep breathing. If you do that you'll make it back to your wife,"" he said recently by phone. ""I knew I was injured. It was whether I could bring myself to remain calm and not freak out and cause my vitals to go crazy."" What Nicely, who had stepped on the pressure plate of a roadside bomb, didn't realize at the time was that he had lost more than his legs. His arms also would need to be amputated. In another war, another time, Nicely would have died on the battlefield. Truth be told, there's a strong chance his heart did stop at some point on that day in March 2011. But thanks to modern body armor and a helicopter that arrived in just six minutes -- as well as quick reactions by his fellow Marines -- Nicely lived and became just the second quadruple amputee to survive battlefield injury wounds. They are a small group, the quadruple amputee combat vets -- just five of them. There are also 40 triple amputees. When they come home, they have their own set of issues, but many face the problems of every wounded vet. They start their new lives together. ""When you are out on the battlefield, you don't realize how many amputees there are because you are not there and you don't see them,"" Nicely said. ""But when you are in the hospital and see all the amputations. ... But it's like one big support group. It doesn't matter whether you are a quad or missing one leg, it doesn't matter, everybody is in it together and it's like one big family in there."" For many wounded service members, the process of moving from military life back to civilian life can be confusing and fraught with delays. For Nicely, it was the frustrating wait for his discharge paperwork. For many injured troops, it can be getting their benefits straightened out. ""Despite the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs' best efforts, oftentimes the transition feels like you've been thrown off a cliff,"" said Jonathan Pruden, who as an Army captain lost a leg in Iraq in 2003 and now works for the Wounded Warrior Project. Organizations step up . On September 11, 2001, an off-duty New York City firefighter named Stephen Siller found the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel blocked to traffic during the chaos after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Siller, who was headed to play golf that morning, instead returned to his firehouse to grab his 60 pounds of gear, put it on and run the three miles to the burning towers, where he was killed. Stiller's brother Frank created the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. Last year, he heard the story of Brendan Marrocco, a 22-year-old soldier from his Staten Island neighborhood, who was the first quadruple amputee wounded in war. ""We know that we've been at war because of what happened on 9/11, so we knew that we had to take care of our military,"" Siller said. Siller went to visit Marrocco at Washington's Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he promised the Army specialist his organization would help with one of the soldier's greatest needs, a home with smart technology. Siller's organization worked with other groups, including a foundation headed by actor Gary Sinise, to raise more than $800,000 for the home, which has special features like stoves and sinks that move up and down, elevators, heated outdoor wheelchair ramps (to melt snow) and appliances that Marrocco controls by computer. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation has agreed to build homes for the other quadruple amputees and -- it hopes -- for triple amputees. The foundation plans to build 11 houses this year. YouTube: Watch as Todd Nicely visits his future home . ""When you meet these kids they are so inspiring,"" Siller said. ""They are incredible. Their spirit, the way they work so hard to get back to living every day in what is their new normal."" Nicely said his new home, being built in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, will lift a big burden. ""Having to rely on my wife to do a lot of things for me kinda takes a toll,"" he said. ""When you're not able to do things for yourself it kind of sets you back a little bit, so getting in there and getting to run at everything with a full head of speed is going to be pretty nice."" Other organizations, like the Veterans of Foreign Wars, also help wounded service members face obstacles. The VFW helps veterans file disability claims. Dawn Jirak, VFW assistant director for veterans' health policy, said agents from the organization scour medical records to find everything a veteran should claim. They also explain to vets what conditions cannot be claimed as related to their time in the military. The agents also explain what to look for in the future. ""There are certain presumptive conditions for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan that may pop up in one year or five,"" Jirak said. ""But if no one tells them, they won't know."" More than 624,000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have filed disability claims, Military Times reported in January. More than two-thirds of all applications for benefits take the VA more than 125 days to process. Pruden, the former Army captain who is an alumni manager for the Wounded Warrior Project, is concerned that as wars end, Department of Defense funds for the severely wounded will dry up and the VA will struggle to fill the void. ""Our big concern is that the VA is not prepared to fill those shoes either in research or long-term rehab care,"" Pruden said. ""Additional funding, additional staffing and ongoing oversight from Congress are important."" The next steps . Nicely, who now walks with prosthetic legs, plans to go back to college soon, after he and his wife, Crystal, move into their new home. He thinks he'll end up working for Tunnels to Towers one day when it opens an office in St. Louis. He wants to raise public awareness on the plight of this new kind of veteran, the triple or quadruple amputee, and help them get homes that work for them, he said. He also wants to counsel other wounded troops. Recently he met with Army Staff Sgt. Travis Mills, who lost his four limbs in a similar way. Nicely wanted to actually walk into a room at Walter Reed and show Mills something important. ""There's life after the hospital bed,"" he said. ""You just have to put in the time and energy.""","More troops surviving bad wounds thanks to battlefield medicine, body armor .

"(CNN) -- There is, perhaps, no greater living symbol of the untamed, pioneer spirit of the American West than the wild mustang. In the Great Basin of the United States -- a vast, empty, desert plain that stretches across most of Nevada and includes parts of Utah, Idaho, Oregon and California -- it's estimated that 40,000 mustangs still roam free. They're regarded by many as part of the national heritage and a treasure for people the world over to enjoy. ""They're sensual,"" says Madeleine Pickens, owner of Nevada's new Mustang Monument: Wild Horse Eco Resort. ""When you come across a wild bunch, it's euphoria."" Her new resort provides a sanctuary for some of these horses while also offering a deluxe stay for those interested in discovering a little more about this American icon. History of the Mustang . Though some dispute the claim, scholars generally believe that mustangs were introduced to the New World by the Spanish in 1493, having been brought over by Columbus on his second voyage to the Americas. When Native Americans first saw them, they called them ""big dogs."" But soon they became an essential component of the life of America's first people and are still considered sacred by many tribes. In the 19th century, horses of all types, of course, played an essential role in the westward expansion and modernization of America. Future uncertain . Wild horses are protected under federal law. But protection policies aren't popular with everyone who lives and works in the West. Ranchers view mustangs as a threat to their livelihood. ""They're feral,"" says a former mustanger -- the term used for cowboys charged with controlling their numbers. ""Without a natural predator, their presence is unsustainable and bad for the environment."" Charged with maintaining the ecological balance of public grazing land, the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has found itself in the middle of disputes related to mustangs and wild horses. (Often used generically to describe any wild horse, ""mustang"" is derived from the Spanish term ""mustengo,"" which means ""ownerless beast"" or ""stray horse."") In April, according to The Salt Lake Tribune, Iron County officials in Utah drafted a letter to the BLM in effect telling the government that if it didn't remove wild horses from their land, local residents would do the job themselves. In June, a suit brought against the federal government by the Nevada Association of Counties and Nevada Farm Bureau Federation demanded that the BLM accelerate roundups of mustangs there, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. In Nevada, the BLM agreed with ranchers that wild herds threaten the range, but also said it doesn't have the resources to conduct the popular roundups. Roundups . Roundups of free roaming horses destined for short term holding pens -- or worse, illegal poaching for sale to slaughterhouses -- have become regular occurrences. Animal rights groups argue that many of these ""gatherings"" are unnecessarily cruel, leaving many animals wounded or dead. They contend that the level that has been set for a sustainable number of wild horses on the land, and reports of their negative impact on the environment, have been skewed in the favor of opposing human interest groups. Although the BLM adopts a portion of roundup animals to new homes, costs for keeping them are escalating. In 2013, $46.2 million was spent keeping roughly 50,000 wild horses in short- and long-term holding pens. Seed of a solution . Mustang Monument: Wild Horse Eco-Resort is a new boutique, luxury ranch that may offer a partial solution. The brainchild of billionaire businesswoman, philanthropist and former wife of oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens, Madeleine Pickens, the new ranch is designed to provide a sanctuary for up to a thousand wild horses and a chance for tourists to connect with this iconic symbol of America. By eliminating expensive holding pens, Pickens says that her ranch alone can save taxpayers as much as $2.5 million a year, while allowing the horses to roam free. Mustang Monument . Each of the resort's 10 reclaimed wood cottages and 10 live-in teepees have been designed with luxuriously rustic interiors, double beds and artisan bric-a-brac -- if Pottery Barn and Vogue were to elope West, this is where they'd honeymoon. Meals are served in an enormous hand-painted teepee, there's a saloon with saddle bar stools, high-end gambling tables and a porch for cocktails with a perfect view of the grazing herd. ""It's good for your soul,"" resident cowboy Clay Naninni says. ""Just to watch them run."" Six hundred wild horses roam in a 4,000-acre enclave at the front of the ranch. Experienced riders can saddle up and head out with resident cowboys, Clay Nannini and Marcus Morrison, for a high adrenalin gallop into the herd that feels, according to Clay, ""like riding into thunder."" For others, there are gentle trots and 4x4 wild horse safaris in search of nearby free-roaming bands, old gold mining settlements and luxurious picnics in mountain valleys. The highlight: rattling down to a private meadow in an old wagon to serve breakfast to the herd. Being surrounded by 600 wild, staring eyes and stamping hooves is a rare thrill. Other guest experiences . Mustangs may be the ranch's raison d'etre, but there's more than horses here. Hiking, abseiling, gambling tables, lasso lessons, an in-teepee spa and more are on offer. Former Navy Seal and director of operations, Monty Heath, can also take you out on a high-powered ATV. When an ex-special forces operative insists on doing the driving, you know he's not going skimp on screams. Two brothers from the local Lumbee tribe are on hand to teach Native American crafts -- from learning how to make beaded jewelry to creating medicine wheels, dream catchers and more. Each night there's storytelling by the fire and performances of sacred dance and traditional falsetto singing. ""Horses are sacred to our people,"" the Native singers say. ""We treat them as human beings."" Things to do: The Ruby Mountains . The Ruby Mountains may be Nevada's best kept secret. The 80-mile range is right on the doorstep of the ranch and offers some of the finest outdoor opportunities in the state. Lamoille Canyon is one of the most popular locations and is filled with fast flowing rivers, beaver dams and idyllic fishing and camping spots. The 35-mile Ruby Crest Trail is a great way to see some of the best parts of the range and usually takes about three days to hike. Things to do: Great Basin National Park . Great Basin National Park -- a 77,000-acre wilderness of glacier moraines, sagebrush meadows and forests of spruce, aspen and juniper -- is located three hours south of the ranch. You can hike to the 13,000-foot summit of Wheeler Peak, find pristine alpine lakes and descend deep into the Lehman Caves, a mesmerizing underground complex of stalactites and stalagmites. The park is most famously home to an ancient grove of bristlecone pines, the oldest living organism on Earth, whose roots were already in the ground when the Great Pyramids of Egypt were being built.

"New York (CNN) -- Five-year-old Anthony Smith didn't think superheroes wore hearing aids, until he became one. His mother, Christina D'Allesandro, says the epic journey began in May, when her superhero-fanatic son, who is deaf in one ear and partially deaf in the other, refused to wear his blue hearing aid because ""superheroes don't wear hearing aids"" either. Desperate, she decided to consult the experts. She found a general e-mail address on the Marvel Comics website and sent a message ""into the ethers,"" asking if there were any hearing-impaired superheroes. A few weeks later, the mother of two was shocked to get an overwhelming response from Marvel, including comic book art that honored her son. ""When he first saw the comic book cover, he said, 'Oh my God, it's me,' "" she told CNN. ""He was very excited."" ""We decided to make him an honorary Avenger,"" a member of the Marvel Comics superhero crime-fighting team, said Bill Rosemann, a Marvel editor. Two artists, Manny Mederos and Nelson Ribeiro, sent the D'Allesandro family comic book covers featuring their very own versions of honorary Avenger Blue Ear, inspired by Anthony, whose blue earpiece gives him the power to hear a pin drop from the other side of a state. One cover features a younger Anthony and his buddy Hawkeye ready to fight crime. The other shows an older version of Blue Ear perched on a rooftop, tapping into his superpower and listening to a faraway call for help. On Tuesday, the young New Hampshire boy is being welcomed as a special guest at an event at the Center for Hearing and Communication clinic in New York City, where he will get to meet a fellow crime-fighting partner in the Marvel universe, Iron Man. ""The reason why it was so easy for us to respond to this is because our characters, which were invented around the '60s, all have real challenges."" Rosemann said. He talked about how all the characters ""became superheroes despite of -- or because of -- the challenges they face."" Under his elastic Spidey skin is a skinny Peter Parker, who constantly gets picked on at school, Rosemann said. As a boy, superhero Daredevil was blinded in an accident that also gave him a radar sense. And Iron Man first created armor to fix his heart, and he then developed the armor into his famous suit. ""We link challenges with their superpowers,"" Rosemann said. ""Our mantra is what (Marvel Comics chief) Stan Lee said: With great power there must come great responsibility. Our guys thought, 'If I have the ability to draw, I am going to use it to help someone like Anthony feel comfortable about his hearing aid.' "" Rosemann and his team collaborated with Phonak, the maker of Anthony's hearing aid, and came up with a poster to be distributed in doctors' offices across the country in an effort to destigmatize kids with hearing aids. The poster, to be unveiled at Tuesday's special event, features none other than fearless Iron Man, whose message is that kids who use hearing aids are just like him because ""they are using technology to be their best self."" ""It will be an Iron Man and Blue Ear team-up,"" Rosemann said about the event. Closer to home, all the attention has brought excitement and meaning for Anthony and his mother. ""In this house, we are looking forward to meeting Iron Man,"" D'Allesandro said. ""He is a big Avengers fan."" The experience has given Anthony the confidence and the ability to talk about his disability, she said. ""He goes up to kids and says, 'Hey, I have a little ear and a blue ear. Do you want to play?' "" People have reached out to her, and she says her family is grateful that this experience has connected her and her son to a wonderful network of families with special needs children. When asked if there is a comic book series on the horizon featuring Blue Ear, Rosemann said, ""There is nothing planned right now, but with so many people responding to Blue Ear, you never know what's next ..."" ""People should just stay tuned.""","Marvel Comics artists make Anthony Smith, 5, an honorary Avenger .

"(CNN) -- Researchers around the world are being asked to help stop the largest known Ebola outbreak in history. An emergency research ""all call"" was issued Thursday by Wellcome Trust and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development amid rising cases of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in the west African countries of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Money for Ebola research will be made available from a $10.8 million initiative funded by the trust and the government department. Wellcome Trust is also making an additional five-year commitment for $66.5 million to ""develop the next generation of African health researchers,"" it said in a statement. This money will go toward sub-Saharan scientists who are studying neglected tropical diseases, HIV, tuberculosis and other diseases, according to a press release. Experts are being asked to submit their proposals for treatments, details on Ebola and how it spreads, along with strategies on how to prevent its transmission. These proposals will be reviewed immediately, the statement said, so that research can start as soon as possible. ""We are launching an emergency call for research to strengthen what we know about Ebola and how it spreads,"" International Development Secretary Justine Greening said in a statement. ""This will help us better equip those working on the ground so they can tackle the outbreak as effectively as possible and prevent more people contracting this terrible disease."" Wellcome Trust Director Dr Jeremy Farrar says the gravity of the Ebola epidemic demands an ""urgent response."" ""We believe rapid research into humanitarian interventions and therapeutics can have an impact on treatment and containment during the present outbreak. What we learn could also change the way we approach future outbreaks, providing us with tested tools and techniques that were not available to public health authorities this time,"" he said. In an opinion piece published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, Oxford University epidemiologist Oliver Brady said ""tens of thousands of doses of experimental drugs are needed to fight"" the deadly Ebola outbreak happening in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. As of Wednesday, the number of deaths from Ebola had reached 1,350, according to the World Health Organization. Brady and two of his colleagues pooled available data to estimate how many doses would be required to fight the epidemic, identifying key risk groups that require help and looking at probable levels of exposure. They found ""up to 30,000 people so far would have required experimental drugs and vaccines"" in the current outbreak. They concluded that the demand for medicine to treat people with Ebola and prevent further transmission is likely to be higher than most experts realize. Brady warned that both production and distribution must be scaled up to allow for equitable roll-out of any experimental drugs. Currently there is no approved or scientifically proven drugs to treat Ebola, and no vaccine. Treatment consists of giving fluids, monitoring vital signs and responding to acute medical crisis. Finding that treatment is key in preventing future outbreaks and the spread of the disease, experts say. Already several experimental drugs are in development. One, ZMapp was given to Americans Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly when they were seriously ill. Both seem to be doing well in a hospital in Atlanta. More recently, the drug was given to three health care workers in Liberia who are also recovering. But researchers say there still isn't enough evidence to say whether the drug will be effective in other patients. There is continuing pressure on drug companies and researchers to produce a treatment that could work for the masses. The immediate need has put the U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval process to the test and challenged them to be more lenient. The Ebola therapy drug TKM-Ebola has already been tested for safety in small clinical trials, but until now wasn't approved by the FDA for use in patients. A shipment of 800 to 1,000 doses of the vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV, were delivered to health officials in Liberia, as a donation from the Public Health Agency of Canada last week. It's unclear if anyone in West Africa has received the vaccine. The Canadian agency said its stockpile is gone. Mapp Biopharmaceuticals,which produces ZMapp, said it has also sent its entire stock of the experimental drug overseas.

"Washington (CNN) -- Back in home districts for a week and eager to tout some accomplishments in Washington, many members of Congress are praising a newly passed bill they say protects the military. But in reality the measure to reverse most military retirement cuts is the legislative equivalent of a cocaine hit: a feel-good high that obscures current problems, makes future issues worse (for the Pentagon and taxpayers) and sends one of the best signals yet that Congress is nowhere near making the tough decisions needed to avoid the financial storm set to crash on the federal budget in just a few years. ""It's what we ridicule all the time,"" an unhappy Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, told me as he left the final vote on the military bill Wednesday. Flake was one of just three senators who voted no, despite a chorus of criticism with the way the bill was funded. CNNMoney: Senate votes to restore military pensions . The measure rolls back a gradual 1% cut in military pensions. (It rolls back that cut for anyone who joined the military before this year.) It pays for that by tacking on one more year of across-the-board, or sequester, cuts to Medicare 10 years from now. The money may not exist . ""Spend now, pay later, "" Flake concluded. ""It never happens."" Among the hefty issues with the bill is that it pays to end a problem now with money that won't arrive for a decade. In some ways, it is like buying a house today based on income you expect to get 10 years from now. Homeowners couldn't do that, but lawmakers can because they operate in 10-year budget windows. That allows them to access money on paper now that won't be tangible for years to come. But that practice can be risky. ""We don't know what the future will look like,"" explained Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""We don't know if the (budget assumptions) are correct; we don't know who will be in Congress; we don't know who will be president."" Goldwein and the committee feel so strongly, the think tank included the idea of paying for short-term costs with money 10 years ahead in a chartbook it released last week of eight budget gimmicks. Above all, we don't know if future Congresses will rethink the sequester cuts. And based on the past two years of cuts, parts of which have already been reversed, it would be stunning if lawmakers ahead left the sequester intact all the way until 2024. Seeing it as 'fuzzy math' but voting yes anyway . There is some irony when you look at fiscal crusaders and this bill. In the House, 199 Republicans voted against the debt ceiling suspension, which would not have directly changed the amount of government spending, only whether the government could pay for that spending. Senate passes debt-ceiling bill in blow to tea party . But of those 199 anti-debt purists, only 16 voted no for the military retirement bill, even though some thought it could actually lead to increased spending because of its risky assumptions. That military retirement bill, however, had a distinct advantage: It was short-term benefit for American troops and their families, a group with undeniable political support. Some stalwart conservatives faced a tough decision. The night before the House vote on the military retirement bill, Arizona conservative Matt Salmon railed against the idea of paying for it with Medicare cuts in 10 years. ""If you believe we're ever going to really do that,"" Salmon said surrounded by a crowd of lawmakers and reporters, ""I think it's fuzzy math to be honest with you. I think any (savings) that you push over two years out, you can't really guarantee any of that. It's a concept only."" He didn't trust the fund to be there in 10 years. But the next morning, Salmon voted for the measure anyway. His office posted a prominent release trumpeting his debt ceiling vote, but mentioned nothing about his decision on the military COLA. His spokeswoman did not respond to CNN's requests for an explanation of his vote. This will hurt the military . The Pentagon faces a major money problem. Health and retirement costs are skyrocketing, which have led to a jump in personnel costs of more than 50% between 2001 and 2012 alone, according to the Pentagon, and are forecast to keep skyrocketing in coming decades. Those increasing costs mean less money for things like equipment and training. So, by reversing the cost-of-living adjustment to retirees, some believe Congress just hurts troop readiness. ""Compensation costs are hollowing out the Pentagon's budget,"" House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan wrote in a statement, ""They are taking resources away from training and modernization â€” and putting our troops at risk. This bill takes away over $6 billion from military readiness."" Ryan was one of the 16 Republicans to vote against both the military pay ""fix"" and the debt ceiling bill. His budget agreement with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, in December created the military pension cut, so he is directly tied to the policy. But he insisted that he is open to reforming that cut, just not in this manner. ""Rather than making the tough choices, (this bill) sidesteps them,"" he wrote. Why do Republicans opposes unemployment benefits? So why did everyone vote for it? ""I voted yes,"" Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said. ""I didn't think the military COLA in isolation should have been included in the budget package to begin with... We can't single out the finest among us for that type of reform."" When asked what he makes of other Republicans who believe the money to pay for the fix is based on ""fuzzy math,"" the tea party conservative nodded, ""I understand the viewpoint, no doubt about it."" ""Obviously i would have preferred my pay-for,"" said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, who proposed saving money by blocking illegal immigrants from obtaining a child tax credit. That didn't win out, and she voted yes for the bill with 2024 Medicare cuts instead. ""I'm just glad that we're moving forward to at least grandfather those who have sacrificed so much for the country,"" she said minutes after the vote. It was a question of priority, sure. Congress decided that fixing the military retirement pay was the priority. But that is not the only question. Just as prominent a question as the country faces a soaring debt forecast is how to pay for it. Congress cannot make any remotely tough choices . ""We're going to have to make serious and substantial cuts across government, this is pretty small,"" Flake told me as he rode the elevator down from the Senate vote. ""If we can't do this, then we stand no chance of addressing our debt and deficit in a meaningful way."" The U.S. deficit at the moment could easily inspire false hope and make someone like Flake sound like a death-rattler. The deficit is plummeting -- still a healthy $500 billion, but down by half from its $1-trilion-plus heights. But under current policy, that positive trend won't last to see the next president. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecasts that federal deficits will start climbing again in 2016 and will be back at the $1 trillion level in eight years. What's worse, the deficit continues to grow as a share of GDP, sucking more and more potential life out of the economy. But rather than face the tough financial issues involved (entitlement costs, including health care and retirement, especially), Congress decided to reverse one of the few hard decisions it's made lately and pay for the military retirement reversal with debatable funding. ""What they did here was they reversed the hardest and the most structurally significant choice in the Murray-Ryan budget agreement,"" Goldwein said. ""That was the only real entitlement reform in the Murray-Ryan bill, and it was relatively modest. They took that tough choice and replaced it with a completely not tough choice."" Goldwein says the committee has moved from pushing for deficit reforms worth trillions of dollars to hoping that lawmakers just pay for the bills they pass with honest money (no gimmicks). Which is why passage of the military COLA bill, no matter how well-intentioned for military retirees, is a blaring siren of greater problems. A Congress well-schooled in the deficit chose an easy, risky way out of what was, relative to the coming fiscal issues, a modest problem. What military families may gain for the next few years they could easily lose in either readiness or in much larger taxpayer problems ahead. ""We're in a bad place right now, I think,"" Goldwein said.","Congress sends strong signal it can't make tough decisions on spending .

"(CNN) -- The National Basketball Association's strategy for forcing the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers by Donald Sterling hinges on a document the owner signed when he bought the team in 1981 that lays out reasons ownership could be terminated, a source familiar with the situation said Wednesday. Sterling has been banned for life from the team's day-to-day operations and facilities and was fined $2.5 million last week for racist comments that were recorded and posted online late last month. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 NBA owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers. The matter is with the Advisory/Finance Committee, which met Wednesday on a conference call. Members discussed the ""termination of Mr. Sterling's ownership of the team,"" the NBA said in a news release. The committee will meet again next week, the statement said. If the case proceeds to a full vote, 75% of the owners would have to approve the forced sale. The source told CNN that on several occasions since 1981 Sterling has signed other agreements with the NBA -- some within the past decade -- that contained moral clauses. Sterling's comments, the source explained, puts the 80-year-old owner in violation of Article 13(d) of the NBA constitution, which states that an owner can lose the team if he fails or refuses to ""fulfill its contractual obligations to the Association, its Members, Players, or any other third party in such a way as to affect the Association or its Members adversly."" It is unclear what percentage of the team Sterling owns. A family trust owns the Clippers, and his wife, Shelly Sterling, has indicated that she is a co-owner and wants to keep the team. Donald Sterling, a lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, has not spoken publicly since the celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a 10-minute audio recording in which he chastises a woman for posting pictures on Instagram in which she poses with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. On Tuesday, one of Sterling's longtime friends, former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, said the remarks were not surprising. But he had no admiration for the woman who recorded them, V. Stiviano. ""I've been a friend of that guy's for 30 years,"" Lasorda said while getting an honorary degree from Northwood University in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""It doesn't surprise me that he said those things. And he shouldn't have said it. He just hurt himself by talking too much and doing things he shouldn't be doing."" As for Stiviano? ""And I don't wish that girl any bad luck,"" he said, ""but I hope she gets hit with a car."" Stiviano, through attorney Mac E. Nehoray, has denied leaking the recordings, another of which was posted by the sports website Deadspin.

"(CNN) -- A powerful earthquake struck early Monday in western Iran, injuring at least 250 people in a region near the border with Iraq. Local authorities said they fear the quake may have caused widespread destruction in rural areas. The 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit at a depth of around 10 kilometers (6 miles) in an area 36 kilometers southeast of the Iranian city of Abdanan, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was followed by a series of aftershocks. The quake injured at least 250 people in the province of Ilam, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported, citing local disaster management authorities. The tremors cut off water, electricity and phone lines in Abdanan. There were no immediate reports of any deaths. Ilam Governor Majid Asghari told IRNA that authorities expected to find severe destruction in rural areas close to the epicenter, which was roughly 40 kilometers from the Iraqi border and not far from Iranian oil exploration and production facilities. IRNA reported that eight villages were particularly hard hit, with around half the homes in them destroyed. Two weaker earthquakes, of magnitudes 4.8 and 5.0, had hit Ilam on Sunday, the USGS said.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Russia asserted its diplomatic and military muscle Saturday as tensions remained high ahead of a vote on secession in Crimea. About 60 Russian troops in six helicopters and three armored vehicles reportedly crossed into Ukraine's Kherson region and were in the town of Strilkove, on a strip of land just northeast of Crimea. The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said the Russian troops were on the ground and the Ukrainian guards had taken defensive positions. The region is key to neighboring Crimea, because it gets electricity, freshwater and natural gas from there. The Russians said they were in Kherson to prevent a possible terrorist attack on oil assets in the area, according to the Ukrainian border guards. CNN team in Crimea: This is a McMoment to remember . Ukraine's foreign ministry termed the move a ""military invasion"" and called on Russia to withdraw its forces. Also Saturday, Russia wielded it's veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council against a U.S. draft resolution that declared Sunday's Crimea referendum invalid. Thirteen of the 15 Security Council members backed the resolution, while China abstained. ""The reason only one country voted 'no' today is that the world believes that international borders are more than mere suggestions,"" said U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power after the vote. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin argued that Crimean citizens had a right to self-determination. What happens next in Crimea? Blue white and red Russian flags dominate the streets of the coastal Crimean town of Sevastopol, where concerts on the main square have been celebrating the return to the ""motherland"" this past week. ""Everybody believes the results are already rigged,"" said CNN iReporter Maia Mikhaluk from Kiev. ""People are concerned what is going to happen after the referendum,"" she said. ""People are concerned that the Russian army will use force, guns to push (the) Ukrainian army from Crimea."" The referendum will present Crimean residents with the choice of whether to secede from Ukraine and join Russia or effectively become independent. Ukraine's acting foreign minister, Andrii Deshchytsia, repeated Saturday the interim government's position that the referendum is illegitimate and will not be recognized by Kiev or the international community. Ukraine is engaged in a ""diplomatic war"" with Russia, he said, but is looking for a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Crimea. It will not respond to Russian ""provocations,"" he said. Russia -- which the West and Ukraine insist has the majority ethnic Russian Crimean peninsula under its effective military control -- has come under concerted international pressure to halt its activities there and talk to the interim government in Kiev. But, so far, it has refused to budge. Moscow has repeatedly denied direct involvement in Crimea, saying that the well-armed men in uniforms without identifying insignia are not Russian troops. Protests for both sides . In the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk, thousands of pro-Russia demonstrators rallied beneath a towering statue of Soviet revolutionary Vladimir Lenin in the city's main square. They waved Russian flags and red flags emblazoned with the iconic image of Argentinian Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. There was not a single Ukraine flag to be seen, according to a CNN team on the ground. ""They are frightened,"" said local journalist Denis Kazansky of pro-Ukraine protesters. ""They will not come out and demonstrate."" A man was fatally stabbed and at least 10 others were injured in clashes in Donetsk on Thursday. Russia blamed ""right-wing radical groups"" for the violence, while Ukrainian authorities suggested it was linked to Russian citizens who want to escalate tensions in Ukraine. Many people living in Ukraine's eastern region, along the Ukraine-Russia border, identify more with Russia than with Ukraine. Saturday, protesters also took to the streets in the Russian capital, Moscow. State news agency Itar-Tass, citing Moscow police, said some 15,000 turned out for a rally in support of the referendum in Crimea, while about 3,000 marched in protest against attempts to reunite Crimea with Russia. The Black Sea peninsula was part of Russia until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in 1954. Ukraine was then part of the Soviet Union. But Russia maintains its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. Opinion: Can West make Putin blink? Lavrov: No ""common vision"" Despite U.S. warnings of ""costs"" for Russia if the vote goes ahead, Moscow has refused to budge on the crisis. Lengthy talks between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in London on Friday resulted in little more than an acknowledgment of the gap between them. As Lavrov said, ""We don't have a common vision."" Meanwhile, thousands of Russian troops continued a large-scale military drill near the Ukraine border. On the same day, armored trucks toting long-range guns and other military equipment rumbled through northern Crimea. At least one of the vehicles seen by CNN had Russian license plates. Already, eight Ukrainian military units in Crimea have been taken over, 22 others are blocked, and 49 of 56 border patrol stations are in similar straits, Ukraine's foreign ministry said. Kiev's new Western-leaning government, which came to power following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, has insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity, including Crimea, must be respected. Moscow has insisted it has the right to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine, who it claims are threatened by radical nationalists and ""fascists."" Opinion: Europe must check the Putin doctrine . Dispute continues . Estonia's defense minister, Urmas Reinsalu, said Friday that Ukraine is on the verge of a full-scale military conflict unless Russian President Vladimir Putin's hand is forced. ""It is clear that we are at a crossroads,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""If positions continue to harden and rhetoric continues to sharpen, there is great risk of a dangerous downward spiral."" Russia so far has refused to engage in direct talks with Ukraine's new leaders, although Lavrov said some communication continues with the interim government in Kiev. Moscow has also denied any direct involvement in Crimea, saying what's happening in the Black Sea peninsula is an internal matter. Russia has a major naval base in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, and thousands of its troops are stationed there. Map: Why the EU and U.S. are out of step on Russia sanctions . Sanctions warning . European nations and the United States have announced some targeted punishments against Russia in addition to offers of billions in aid to Ukraine's fledgling government. Russia has seen steep declines in its stock market and the value of the ruble in recent days. The State Department has cautioned Americans about traveling to Russia given ""the possibility of violence or anti-U.S. actions directed against U.S. citizens or U.S. interests."" Kerry warned Friday that the ""consequences"" will be far more stringent should Putin sign off on the ""back-door annexation"" of Crimea. Lawmakers in Moscow are due to vote next Friday on accepting Crimea into the Russian Federation should there be a ""yes"" vote in the referendum. At the same time, Kerry opened the door for less strident measures should Russia opt not to take in Crimea -- whatever the referendum says -- and instead go along with greater autonomy.

"(CNN) -- Last weekend, suspected Islamic jihadists killed at least 40 students at a Northern Nigerian agricultural college, many while they slept. The Council on Foreign Relations Nigeria Security Tracker shows that jihadist-related attacks in Nigeria are increasing. Most of the victims in this violence are Muslim, but some are Christian. While no group has claimed responsibility for Sunday's massacre, the Nigerian media assigns responsibility to Boko Haram, and the operation has the hallmarks of the group's previous massacres. What is Boko Haram? It remains shrouded in mystery. Boko is the Hausa word for ""book,"" and commonly refers to Western education. Haram is the Arabic word for ""forbidden."" Hostile to democracy, modern science, and Western education as non-Islamic, it is highly diffuse. For some adherents, religious, even apocalyptic, themes appear to be paramount. They are looking toward the creation of God's kingdom on earth through violence against those they see as Islam's enemies, rather than the achievement of a political program. But, political opportunists and criminals also operate under the label of ""Boko Haram."" The movement's umbrella appears to be a shared Islamic vocabulary of protest, a hatred of the secular government in Abuja and of a corrupt Nigerian political economy -- and a disposition toward violence. It is especially murderous toward members of the Islamic establishment that have ""sold out"" to Abuja. It does not appear to have an overarching political structure, and Abubakar Shekau, the leader of perhaps its largest element, does not exercise universal command or control over many of its elements. Does this pose a threat to U.S. or other Western interests? Should ties between the United States and the Abuja government strengthen under the guise of a common ""war on terror,"" American interests -- though limited in Northern Nigeria -- could become a Boko Haram target, not least because ""the friend of my enemy is my enemy."" Thus far, Boko Haram has shown little interest in the world outside of Nigeria and the Sahel. But the situation in Nigeria is dynamic, and it is possible that closer ties will develop between al-Qaeda and elements of Boko Haram. The group was founded by Malam Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic preacher who was murdered by police in 2009 in a public episode that went viral on the internet. But, even with respect to Yusuf's core disciples, there is remarkably little hard information about their structure and leadership. After Yusuf's murder, leadership fell to his deputy, Abubakar Shekau. He normally communicates through videos, and has not been seen in person since Yusuf's death. His latest video appeared in September 2013. The revolt's foot soldiers likely are drawn from unemployed youth in Northern Nigeria, a region of profound poverty. Many of them attended Islamic schools where they learned little other than to memorize the Quran. Often they are children of peasants, rootless if not homeless, in a big city. They can bond through a common radical Islamic sensibility, inchoate rage, and the prospect of earning a little money as terrorists. Up until 2012, Boko Haram attacks appeared to be largely funded by bank robberies. One commentator credibly estimated that there had been several dozen since 2011. Boko Haram has successfully looted weapons from government arsenals. What is new is Boko Haram's use of suicide bombers. Suicide is anathema to West African culture, and had been unknown as a weapon of terror in Nigeria. West African borders are porous, and travel between Nigeria and areas where al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- the Salafi-jihadist militant group -- operates is easy. Yet, while there is evidence of communication between different groups in the region, there continues to be little sign that al-Qaeda's influence has been transformative. Instead of the international jihad, Boko Haram continues to be focused primarily on internal Nigerian issues. It shows little interest in southern Nigeria, let alone Europe or the United States. Still, Nigeria's federal government is addressing Boko Haram as an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist movement. On May 14 President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in the three northern states of Yobe, Adamawa, and Borno, where Boko Haram normally concentrates. But the heavy security presence, especially during the state of emergency in these areas, is dysfunctional. There is a downward spiral, with soldiers resorting to brutality on an increasingly hostile population. On the other hand, soldiers and police are primary targets of Boko Haram, and their casualty levels are high. An endgame is hard to foresee. In the past, millenarian Islamic movements have burned themselves out, often under military pressure. There are few signs this process is under way. And the military appears incapable of controlling it. If Boko Haram is not going away, it is also unlikely to be able to overthrow the Nigerian state. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Campbell.","John Campbell: Islamist Boko Haram suspected in slaughter of Nigerian students .
He says the Nigeria-focused group opposes democracy, science, Western education.

"(CNN) -- There's a reason why Malaysian officials are so confident it was Flight 370 that sent signals to a satellite many hours after the plane disappeared from radar March 8. That's because CNN has learned signals from commercial aircraft to Inmarsat satellites always include a code confirming the identity of the plane. An Inmarsat official, while declining to discuss specifics of Flight 370, tells CNN the satellite system is highly reliable, that each signal to an aircraft is met by a return signal and that those signals always contains a code verifying the identity of the aircraft. It is ""virtually impossible"" to change an aircraft's identifying code or to confuse one aircraft with another, the Inmarsat official said. Further, after a satellite link is established at the beginning of a plane's flight, it makes automatic, periodic checks until the end of the flight -- helping investigators determine the duration of the flight, if not its location. That could explain why Malaysian authorities now say they have a ""high degree of confidence"" that Flight 370 continued flying well after it disappeared from civilian radar screens. Map it: What happened to Flight 370? Government officials now believe the plane continued flying until at least 8:11 a.m. -- almost seven hours after disappearing from radar at 1:21 a.m. Malaysian officials, citing ""satellite information"" but giving scant details, this weekend refocused the search for the missing Boeing 777, moving attention to massive arcs on both sides of the equator. Malaysian authorities believe someone disabled several communications systems, perhaps to conceal the plane's location. One of those systems was a digital data system known as ACARS, which uses the satellite to relay messages to the ground. But while it is possible for someone in the cockpit to turn off ACARS, the system's powered antenna remained on, receiving and responding to hourly checks from a ground station, via the satellite. Inmarsat technicians continue to help, the company said. ""Our experts have been pulled into the investigation. We've had people in Kuala Lumpur,"" said Inmarsat subject expert David Coiley. ""We are putting everything into this to assist the investigation as best we can, because it seems there's no other data set."" How Inmarsat works . Inmarsat, which is prohibited from discussing details of the Malaysia Flight 370 investigation, was able to provide CNN with a detailed explanation about how its system works. The London-based satellite communications company owns and operates 10 satellites, all in geostationary orbit some 22,200 miles above the equator. Since a single satellite can see one-third of the Earth, multiple satellites are needed to provide seamless coverage and provide redundancy and reliability, the company said. Among other services, Inmarsat provides satellite communications for the ACARS, the acronym for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System. It's a digital datalink for short messages between an aircraft and an airline operations center, air traffic controllers and others. ACARS can be used to send messages and data of all types, including text messages from pilots to dispatchers, or automatically generated data on the health of the plane. When a plane is over land, ACARS messages typically are sent via VHF radio. But when a plane is in remote regions, or over water and out of range of VHF radio, the signal is seamlessly switched to satellite. ""The pilot doesn't have to do anything,"" Coiley said. At its most fundamental, the satellite is a simple relay, transferring signals from ground stations to the aircraft, and back again, not unlike a cell phone tower, Coiley said. 'Handshakes' help determine location . When an aircraft powers up, the airplane automatically sends a signal logging onto the communications network. Thereafter, the ground station sends ""polling signals"" to the satellite, which relays them to the aircraft. When the aircraft responds, it is known as a ""handshake."" The information relayed during the handshake is very limited, but it contains a unique identifying code to identify the aircraft. The purpose of the hourly ""handshakes"" is to allow the satellite to know the approximate location of the aircraft so that it can efficiently relay any messages. For this, the satellite needs to know the angle of the aircraft from the satellite. An aircraft directly under the satellite would be at a 90 degree angle to the satellite; an aircraft at the poles would be at 0 degrees. In the case of Malaysia Airlines 370, authorities have said, the last message sent was at 40 degrees. Accident investigators, with the help of satellite experts, have used that information to determine the possible location of the plane. ""We're trying to get up to speed on what that means and how to interpret it,"" one U.S. official told reporters. ""It's sort of a new technology for us."" ""We have never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information,"" the official said. A completed handshake also suggests the plane was operational because the plane needs electrical power to send the return signal. A plane's return signal is an acknowledgment that, ""Yes, I'm still here,"" Coiley said. In the case of Flight 370, the ""last successful handshake occurred somewhere along that circle,"" the U.S. official said. ""A lot of that semicircle is over land; a lot of it is over water,"" he said. ""We are trying to figure out how we can use that information to give us an idea of what the last known location of the airplane might have been.""","London-based satellite communications company Inmarsat talks to CNN .

"New York (CNN) -- This year, as for the past 12 years or more, parishioners from St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church have marched under their church banner in New York's colorful Gay Pride parade. But this year, there was a difference. Their banner was blank, missing the name of the church. New York's Archbishop Timothy Dolan asked the church's pastor to keep St. Francis' name out of the picture. The parish was told that the archdiocese's spiritual leader was concerned the church might be seen as endorsing some elements of the gay pride march that may advocate a promiscuous lifestyle. ""Our people are not endorsing that at all,"" said the church's pastor, the Rev. Joe Costantino. Members of the gay ministries of St. Francis Xavier say they view the parade as an opportunity to welcome gay Catholics back into the fold. They hand out welcome brochures to reach out to anyone watching the march. ""Perhaps some people come to St. Francis because they don't feel judged,"" said Stephanie Samoy, a self-proclaimed lesbian who has been active in the parish for several years. ""I don't know if it's the Holy Spirit, but there's love...the presence of the savior,"" said Samoy. For years, Samoy and other parishioners have taken their spirit to the streets, proud to advertise their church. ""It's empowering, it's refreshing, it's a mission, and people need to know there's a place they can come home to,"" said Samoy. She said when parishioners heard about keeping their church's name under wraps in the march, many in the church's gay ministries weren't happy. ""I was like, hell no,"" said Samoy. Then, she said the LGBT-- lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender -- ministries together decided to march with a blank banner and continue to distribute their brochures. ""We are honoring his request,"" she said of the archbishop. But they also wore T-shirts on which they printed the St. Francis Xavier name. A compromise, Samoy said, that they and their pastor accept. ""For me, the blank banner stands for, 'We've been silenced.' For me, that's also very powerful and we can -- I can -- live with that this year."" A spokesman for Archbishop Dolan told CNN he had no comment.","Parishioners of St. Francis Xavier have marched in Gay Pride parade for years .

"Washington (CNN) -- A December 22 briefing, prepared by the top U.S. intelligence official in Afghanistan and obtained by CNN, maps out the strategy and strength of the Taliban and their allies in Afghanistan, and concludes that the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan is increasingly effective. The briefing, which warns that the ""situation is serious,"" was prepared by Maj. Gen. Michael Flynn last month. His assessment is that the Taliban's ""organizational capabilities and operational reach are qualitatively and geographically expanding"" and the group is capable of much greater frequency of attacks and varied locations of attacks. According to the unclassified briefing, the insurgency can now sustain itself indefinitely because of three factors: . • The increased availability of bomb-making technology and material; . • The Taliban's access to two major funding streams, one from the opium trade and the other from overseas donations from Muslim countries, which reach the Taliban by courier or through a system of informal banks known as ""hawalas"" that operate across much of the Islamic world; and . • The Taliban's continuing ability to recruit foot soldiers based on the perception that they ""retain the religious high-ground,"" and factors such as poverty and tribal friction. A chart in Flynn's briefing notes that security incidents -- which include improvised-explosive attacks, ambushes, mortar and missile assaults -- routinely hit 500 a week in the second half of 2009. That compares with a weekly average of no more than 40 five years ago. Even in the generally slower winter fighting season, incidents have not fallen below 300 a week. The 23-page briefing predicts that ""Security incidents [are] projected to be higher in 2010."" Those incidents are already up by 300 percent since 2007 and by 60 percent since 2008, according to the briefing. One section of the briefing is based on findings from the interrogations of captured insurgents. Those insurgents said the Taliban saw 2009 as the most successful year of the war, because violence had expanded and because the Afghan presidential election on August 20 was marred by low turnout and fraud. Detainees also told interrogators that the Taliban see al Qaeda as a handicap -- a view that is spreading as the Taliban try to present themselves as a nationalist group seeking to liberate Afghanistan from foreign forces. The Flynn briefing also says, however, that al Qaeda ""provides facilitation, training and some funding"" to the Taliban and predicts that ""perceived insurgent success will draw foreign fighters"" into Afghanistan. A map of insurgent groups operating in Afghanistan -- part of the briefing -- shows that an Uzbek militant group, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, already has a presence in five provinces in northern and southern Afghanistan. The briefing also says the Taliban maintain a ""mutually supportive relationship"" with Chechen and central Asian fighters and will seek to ""manage"" their relationship with al Qaeda so as not to alienate the Afghan population, but still ""encourage support from the global jihadi network."" Among the Taliban's motivations, according to interrogations of the captured insurgents: . • The United States is seen as desiring a permanent presence in Afghanistan; . • Promised infrastructure projects are either incomplete or ineffective; . • The government of President Hamid Karzai is seen as corrupt or ineffective; and . • Crime and corruption are pervasive amongst security forces. Detainees also said Taliban leaders strategically aim to portray their insurgency to Afghans as fair and uncorrupted. Part of that strategy is a ""code of conduct"" that Taliban leaders published in mid-July 2009. It advises foot soldiers to ""keep good relationships"" with locals and warns them against mistreating civilians, forcing people to pay donations, searching homes, kidnapping people for money and using child soldiers. Afghanistan in depth:  Afghanistan Crossroads blog . A U.N. report released this month shows that the new Taliban code has not translated into the insurgents killing fewer civilians. The United Nations found that the Taliban killed 1,630 civilians in 2009, representing a 40 percent increase over the previous year. According to the Flynn briefing, the Taliban have largely re-created the command structure they had before the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in fall 2001. The new structure consists of the ""inner shura"" (inner council), an 18-member group headed by Taliban leader Mullah Omar that arrives at decisions based on consensus, but ""within Omar's guidance."" Those decisions are then communicated to regional shuras of up to 20 members, then to provincial shuras and the Taliban's ""shadow [provincial] governors."" The Flynn briefing suggests that the Taliban are effectively creating a parallel government, in competition with the Kabul government. One measure of that, the briefing says: Eleven provinces had a Taliban shadow governor in 2005. The number was 33 by 2009. Can Taliban deliver justice better than Karzai government? The Taliban's strategy in 2010, as described by Flynn, includes expanding into the north and west of Afghanistan, where the Taliban traditionally have had scant support; continuing aggressive operations during winter, when warfare has traditionally eased in Afghanistan; and increasing Taliban influence around the key cities of Kabul and Kandahar. The Taliban's overall strategy is not to defeat international forces in Afghanistan, but to ""outlast international will to remain in Afghanistan."" That is to be achieved partly with more improvised-explosive attacks. Improvised explosives caused 80 percent of U.S. casualties last summer, according to senior U.S. Marine officers in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. The explosives do for the Taliban what surface-to-air missiles once did for the Afghan mujahedeen fighting the Soviets -- somewhat equalize the fight against a superpower, Flynn says. The number of casualties from improvised-explosive attacks in Afghanistan has risen from 326 in 2005 to 6,037 in 2009, according to the briefing. The size of the insurgents' explosives has dramatically increased, according to Flynn. In May 2008, most weighed less than 25 pounds. As of December, more than three-quarters weighed more than 25 pounds. In the past, the report says, improvised explosives were made mainly from military ordnance, such as shells. They are increasingly made from homemade explosives. About 85 percent of improvised explosives in Afghanistan are made with ammonium nitrate, a common fertilizer -- the same ingredient used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. On Friday, Karzai banned the use, production, storage or sale of ammonium nitrate. The Flynn briefing also outlined Taliban weaknesses, including disagreements among local Taliban leaders, the group's dependence on marginalized ethnic Pashtuns, and over-reliance on ""external support,"" an apparent reference to Taliban havens in Pakistan. The briefing concludes that the United States and its allies have a key advantage -- the Taliban have not yet reached the level of a popular movement. A senior U.S. military official in Afghanistan called CNN's account of the report accurate. The official also cited what he called ""fundamental positive change"": significantly fewer civilian deaths caused by U.S. and NATO forces, improved counter-insurgency efforts, and more effective partnering with Afghan security forces.","""Situation is serious,"" warns intelligence briefing on Taliban in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago Uganda was the ""Pearl of Africa,"" a newly independent republic with a thriving economy, a functioning democracy and splendid national parks. It was the place to take a safari holiday -- floating down the crocodile-flanked Nile, fishing on Lake Victoria, wandering among the elephant herds of Queen Elizabeth National Park or listening to the roar of mighty Murchison Falls. With films like ""African Queen"" shot on location there, Uganda was also a Hollywood darling. Then all hell broke loose. Four decades of violence, political turmoil and economic collapse that started with the bloodthirsty reign of Idi Amin (the self-proclaimed President for Life, Conqueror of the British Empire and Last King of Scotland) and ended with the religious psychopath Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army. And it wasn't just the people who suffered: Uganda's animal populations declined precipitously during the troubles as the various ragtag guerrilla groups feasted on wild game. Yet Uganda is bouncing back. Having banished the last of the warlords and kick started its economy, the country is drawing tourists again, a rising star in the safari world. It's a trickle at present -- the high-end travelers and backpackers who are always the early adopters -- and there are very real concerns about the country's recently imposed anti-gay laws, which threaten life imprisonment for ""violators."" But safari operators say they're already gearing up for more visitors in years to come. According to the tourist board, almost 1.2 million tourists came to Uganda last year [2013], an increase of 50% over five years. ""Uganda sadly underwent much turmoil and upheaval from the 1970s onwards,"" says Roni Madhvani, director of the Madhvani Group, which includes Premier Safaris and several of the nation's top wildlife lodges. Expelled from the country as a child during Idi Amin's purge of Asian-Ugandans, Madhvani and his family had to rebuild their business from the ground up when they returned in the 1980s. ""We have had peace and stability for over a decade and the country has indeed emerged from this past void in terms of tourism to become an interesting and discerning destination. ""The offering compared to the neighboring countries is unique, individual and nebulous -- and that in itself is perhaps part of the explanation of the recent increasing interest."" Incredible variety . What Uganda lacks in volume (it's about the same size as Oregon or Cambodia) it more than makes up with variety, an incredible array of landscapes that range from the snowcapped Mountains of the Moon and the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest to the semi-desert northeast and water-spangled lake district. With more than 1.6 million people, Kampala is one of the fastest growing cities on the continent. Nearby Entebbe, set on a peninsula stretching into Lake Victoria, is about as laid back as it gets in Africa. Despite 40 years as a food source for rebel groups, Uganda's wildlife has made a miraculous recovery. Queen Elizabeth National Park nurtures healthy populations of elephant, lion, hippo and other large mammals, and is a major stop on the migratory bird route up the Great Rift Valley. Home to 13 different primate species, Kibale National Park is one of the best places in Africa to see chimpanzees in the wild. Murchison Falls National Park is flush with hippo, crocodile and other animals that live in or near the water. The holy grail of Uganda wildlife watching is Bwindi Forest, where roughly half of the world's mountain gorillas reside. Living up to its ""impenetrable"" tag, the forest can only be accessed on foot, often up and over steep mountain ranges. ""Bwindi's gorilla population is around 400 and growing,"" says Dr Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka, founder of Conservation Through Public Health, which promotes the coexistence of gorillas, humans and other wildlife in Africa. ""This is thanks to increased protection, the elimination of almost all poaching and the fact that we have been able to show local communities how saving the gorillas is beneficial to local health and the local economy."" Get intimate with gorillas . Premier Safaris and other outfitters have pioneered a number of ""up close and personal"" animal encounters during which visitors can tag along on scientific field trips or accompany experts into the bush. Dr Gladys, for instance, leads a four-day ""intimate gorilla experience"" that includes finding gorilla nests, collecting their dung and then analyzing that dung in a field laboratory. In Queen Elizabeth National Park, tourists can spend the day tracking lions with a researcher from the Uganda Carnivore Program, learning how telemetry works and venturing off road into parts of the park vehicles are normally verboten. Urban Uganda has its own attractions. Entebbe is renowned for its popular weekend beach clubs, like a little slice of the Caribbean on the shores of Lake Victoria. Kampala's sights range from the recently rebuilt royal tombs to a humungous mosque built by Libyan strongman Moammer Gadhafi and the ghoulish torture chamber of Idi Amin on the grounds of Lubiri Palace. The capital is also known for its vibrant nightlife, which runs a gamut from down and dirty dance clubs to sophisticated jazz venues. Uganda has also become an adventure sports hub. Several outfitters offer whitewater rafting and kayaking trips down the Nile, past snoozing crocodiles and snorting hippos. Nile High Bungee in Jinja offers an adrenalin-packed plunge (44 meters) into the world's longest river. You can also board surf down rapids, whoosh down rivers on jetboats and organize sports fishing trips to catch the river monster of central Africa -- Nile perch that can grow up to 200 kilograms. Investment opportunities . Investment in Uganda has soared in recent years. Last year, the country rose into the ranks of the top 10 African nations for foreign direct investment. South Africa is one of the largest sources of new investment. Britain, France and China are other leading investors, and through its recent purchase of Protea Hotels, the US-based Marriott Corp now has prime hotel properties in Kampala and Entebbe. Travel infrastructure has also improved markedly. As late as 2006, there were no international airlines serving Entebbe Airport, the nation's aviation gateway. Now the lakeside terminal hosts 17 international carriers, including direct flights from Amsterdam on KLM, London on British Airways and Dubai on Emirates Air. Passenger traffic through Entebbe is increasing at an average of more than 10% per annum. Uganda isn't quite back to being the ""Pearl of Africa"" but it's definitely headed in the right direction. ""Uganda lost a whole generation of tourism talent and workers during the civil wars,"" says Stephen Asiimwe, who took over a CEO of Tourism Uganda earlier this year [2014]. ""That mayhem cost us everything in terms of human capital. But we are a resilient people. We have suffered and we are now back on our feet."" Asiimwe feels the public and private sectors need to join forces in developing skilled workers in the tourism sector. And he says that Uganda needs to think outside the box when it comes to creating new experiences and attractions. Among his ideas are island resorts and sailing regattas on Lake Victoria, encouraging domestic tourism so that Ugandans discover their own country, and promoting Kampala with its myriad music clubs as the nightlife capital of East Africa. There are also socio-political challenges to overcome. Foremost is a series of laws banning homosexual behavior. Rubber stamped by the Ugandan Parliament last December, the latest regulation calls for severe punishment (including life in prison) for violators. Virgin boss Richard Branson is among those who have called for a travel boycott of Uganda in the wake of the new legislation. And in June [2014], the U.S. government announced limited sanctions against Uganda because of the law. The jury is still out on whether or not the anti-homosexuality laws are actively impacting LGBT rights in Uganda. ""It certainly hasn't affected me,"" says a Kampala businessman who lives with his gay partner. ""And I don't think it's had much impact on the gay community as a whole."" He still admits to anxiety about how the laws might be applied in future. ""But for now, that's been my experience in Uganda.""

He traveled through Africa in 2013.","After four decades of violence and political turmoil, Uganda is drawing tourists again .

"(CNN) -- After seven months of an aerial bombing campaign that helped depose Moammar Gadhafi, NATO said Friday it was ending its mission in Libya next week. The expected announcement from the alliance came a day after the United Nations Security Council rescinded its March mandate for military intervention. ""Today, we confirmed the decision taken by the North Atlantic Council a week ago,"" said NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. ""Our operation for Libya will end on October 31. Until then, together with our partners, we will continue to monitor the situation. And if needed, we will continue to respond to threats to civilians. ""Libyans have now liberated their country. And they have transformed the region,"" Rasmussen said. ""This is their victory."" Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said NATO's mission puts Libya on a path to freedom. But she tempered her remarks with a word of caution. ""We're very concerned that, as we move forward, that the authorities make maximum effort to swiftly form an inclusive government that incorporates all aspects of Libyan society, and in which the rights of all Libyan people are fully and thoroughly respected, regardless of their gender, their religion, their region of origin,"" Rice said after the Security Council vote Thursday. ""But for the United States, and, I think, for the United Nations Security Council, this closes what I think history will judge to be a proud chapter in the Security Council's history."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague described the Security Council passage of Resolution 2016 as ""another significant milestone towards a peaceful, democratic future for Libya. Ending the no-fly zone and the civilian protection provisions demonstrates that Libya has entered a new era."" Meanwhile, Gadhafi's relatives plan to file a war crimes complaint with the International Criminal Court against NATO, a lawyer representing the family said Thursday. Members of the family believe NATO's actions led to Gadhafi's death last week, Marcel Ceccaldi said. ""All of the events that have taken place since February 2011 and the murder of Gadhafi, all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the International Criminal Court,"" Ceccaldi said. The ICC had issued a warrant for Gadhafi's arrest, accusing him of crimes against humanity. It still has warrants out for the arrest of Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law and intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Sanussi. Questions have been raised about how Gadhafi was killed. Amateur videos showed him alive when captured by the opposition. He died from a shot in the head, officials said, but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear. Ceccaldi said the Gadhafi family's complaint will be filed in the coming days. ""Now we will wait and see if the ICC is a judicial system which is independent and impartial,"" he added. NATO's Libya campaign began in March, after the Security Council adopted Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone in the country's airspace and authorized member states to take measures to protect civilians. Meanwhile, U.S. officials announced plans to transport 30 seriously wounded Libyan fighters Saturday to U.S. hospitals in Boston and Germany. The National Transitional Council requested the treatment because their wounds can't be treated in Libya, officials said.","NEW: NATO ends its Libya mission Monday .

"(CNN) -- Gather 'round, students: ""How to Get Away with Murder's"" Viola Davis is teaching a lesson in how to win a TV show. The Oscar nominee stars in ABC's much-anticipated new drama from the house of Shonda Rhimes, and it debuted Thursday to critical applause and solid ratings. The third show in ABC's new Thursday night block devoted to Rhimes' programming -- ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Scandal"" and ""How to Get Away with Murder"" air one after another, beginning at 8 p.m. -- ""Murder"" was the strongest of them all in terms of number of viewers. ""Grey's"" was watched by 9.8 million at 8 p.m. and had a 3.0 rating in the adult demographic, while ""Scandal"" returned to its 9 p.m. time slot with 11.9 million watching and a strong 3.8 rating in the key demo. ""How to Get Away with Murder,"" meanwhile, debuted to an audience of 14 million and had a 3.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic. ""Murder,"" which is executive produced by Rhimes and created by ""Grey's Anatomy"" writer/producer Peter Nowalk, sees Davis play Annalise Keating, a smooth criminal defense attorney and professor who's as alluring as she is mysterious. Keating shares the screen with a crew of eager law students working to win her approval. As their prof, she offers them a chance to intern with her firm if they perform well on an assignment. But the group of students we meet in ""How to Get Away with Murder"" wind up facing a much bigger test when there's a dead body involved. After catching the pilot episode, most critics agree that the students may be an integral part of the story -- which, despite not being created by Rhimes, certainly has her trademarks -- but it's Davis viewers will come back for. ""While the show has certain Rhimes' accents -- a strong female lead, a large and diverse ensemble, a willingness to pile on complications -- it is very different from any of the series she has written,"" says the Los Angeles Times. ""Annalise wears neither a white hat nor her heart on her sleeve ... (and) seems more than capable of being both Sherlock and Moriarty. Backward, in heels."" For HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, the pilot runs into trouble when it focuses too much time on the students and their deadly mystery. ""The characters involved are so much less compelling than Annalise that it feels like a magic trick gone awry -- sleight of hand that keeps pulling your attention from the one person who makes the show work,"" Sepinwall writes. ""Viola Davis is a star, and it's long overdue that she got to frontline a show like this. It'd be a shame if that show winds up underusing her because it didn't trust that she'd be enough through the sheer brute force of her personality."" The A.V. Club, which was also frustrated by a lack of Davis screen time, believes that the series has promise. "" 'How To Get Away With Murder' faces some of the same issues many Shondaland properties have faced: a weakness for melodramatic plotting that sacrifices emotional complexity for clichÃ©s and mere complication,"" the review says. ""But it has excellent bones, grounded in an outstanding pedigree and Rhimes' demonstrated ability to keep an audience hooked from scandal to scandal. It's not perfect, but it's never boring."" After Thursday's premiere, viewers seemed to agree, with many tweeting that they've found their new favorite show. Did you watch? Did you agree that the pilot needed more Davis and less focus on the students? Let us know what you thought in the comments.","ABC's ""How to Get Away with Murder"" has received mostly positive reviews .

"(CNN) -- He is merciless toward opponents, secretive to the point of being a recluse and a true believer in the cause of global jihad. And from his hideout somewhere in southern Somalia, Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, the emir of Al-Shabaab, has planned numerous terror attacks, including the deadliest in Kenya since the U.S. Embassy bombing in 1998. Zubayr, who is also known as Ahmed Abdi Godane, already has a price on his head. In 2012, the U.S. State Department authorized a reward of up to $7 million for information on his whereabouts. But he has 15 years on his terror resume, and according to information provided by a well-placed source in Mogadishu who has extensive knowledge of Al-Shabaab, he ""is ruthlessly eliminating real and imagined rivals"" within the group. U.S. manned and unmanned aircraft set out on Monday to end his campaign of terror, though the fate of Zubayr or a deputy, Abu Abdalla, was still unclear a day later. U.S. attacks Al-Shabaab leader in Somalia . Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the attack was directed at the Al-Shabaab leader and that ""we certainly believe that we hit what we were aiming at."" But he didn't say who, if anyone, died in the attack. Zubayr's vision has been to transform Al-Shabaab from an insurgent outfit focused on Somalia into a terrorist group capable of devastating attacks beyond Somalia. He has already directed at least two: suicide bombings against bars in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010, and last year's Westgate mall siege in Nairobi, Kenya. After the Uganda attacks, which killed more than 70 people, Zubayr warned: ""What happened in Kampala was just the beginning."" One key suspect in the Kampala attacks, known as Jabir, allegedly was an explosives instructor and answered directly to Zubayr. Jabir is known to have visited Uganda at least four times before the July 2010 attack. The source in Mogadishu told CNN last year: ""Zubayr is creating Al-Shabaab 2.0."" For Zubayr, the struggle has always been a global confrontation with ""disbelievers"" rather than just about Somalia. He also vowed that his group would launch a direct attack against the United States. Zubayr is 37, according to most accounts, and originally from Somaliland, now a vaguely autonomous part of northern Somalia. He is slim to the point of wispy, as shown in the few photographs of him, and prefers recording audio messages to appearing in public. As a teenager, he studied at a Pakistani madrasa, thanks to a grant from a wealthy Saudi, and he returned home with militant beliefs. He was thought to have been involved in the abduction and killings of foreign aid workers in Somaliland, including the death of Italian aid worker Annalena Tonelli in 2003. Among his close associates in Al-Shabaab's early days was Aden Ayrow, a towering force in the group and a ruthless and mercurial pro-al Qaeda hard-liner. After Ayrow's death in May 2008 in a U.S. strike, Zubayr asserted his leadership of Al-Shabaab and immediately pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2009, he once refused to discuss a military offensive against government forces in Mogadishu with Al-Shabaab's allies until one of them apologized for remarks he had made critical of bin Laden. But bin Laden was wary of an al Qaeda merger with Al-Shabaab. About a year before his death, he wrote to Zubayr that enemies would ""escalate their anger and mobilize against you. This is what happened to the brothers in Iraq or Algeria."" Bin Laden's deputy at that time, Ayman al-Zawahiri, took a different view. A letter dated December 2010, which was recovered from bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and was thought by researchers to have been written by al-Zawahiri, was critical of bin Laden's decision to rebuff entreaties by the Somali militant group. ""I see it to be very essential for al Qaeda to confirm and declare its linkage with its branches. ... Please reconsider your opinion not to declare the accession of the brothers of Somalia,"" the author wrote. In February 2012, Zubayr formally declared Al-Shabaab an affiliate of al Qaeda with a long message to al-Zawahiri in which he said: ""We will go with you as loyal soldiers until doom and injustice disappear from Islam."" Zubayr has always rejected any negotiations with Somalia's transitional federal government. According to another U.S. diplomatic cable unearthed by WikiLeaks, Zubayr rejected an initiative in 2009 by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi to mediate in Somalia, telling him that once a true Islamic government was established in Somalia, he would move on to other countries, including Libya. He opposes elections, saying, ""The reality is that democracy is something Allah made unlawful, and someone else cannot make it lawful."" As Al-Shabaab came under greater pressure from the African Union force stationed in Mogadishu, Zubayr turned to suicide bombings against civilians. In December 2009, an Al-Shabaab bomber killed 23 people at a university graduation ceremony in Mogadishu. Some factions inside Al-Shabaab disowned the attack, but Zubayr was unmoved. As a northerner, unlike other Al-Shabaab commanders, he did not belong to a clan in the areas controlled by the group and was therefore less concerned about civilian casualties. According to a confidential U.N. assessment, Zubayr demanded more suicide attacks to supplement conventional fighting. At least two such suicide attacks have come this year: a May attack on a restaurant popular with foreigners in the city of Djibouti and failed attacks on a presidential compound in Mogadishu. Zubayr's rejection of negotiations, poor management of military campaigns and the clan system soon led to dissent in Al-Shabaab. According to diplomatic cables in 2009, Zubayr wanted to declare an Islamic caliphate in areas controlled by Al-Shabaab, which included much of central and southern Somalia. Others in Al-Shabaab's leadership disagreed, saying the group had to gain greater public support before such a move. But fearful of assassination, they kept their counsel. The imposition of brutal Taliban-like law eventually alienated large sections of the population in southern and central Somalia. One prominent Al-Shabaab member, the American Omar Hammami, said in a video in 2012 that other elements in the group were trying to kill him. He followed up with a series of tweets attacking Zubayr. ""Abu Zubayr has gone mad. He's starting a civil war,"" he tweeted. Zubayr responded by ordering the killing of Hammami, who was wounded by a gunshot in April 2013. His intelligence wing caught up with Hammami months later and killed him, just days after he told the Voice of America that Zubayr had ""turned Al-Shabaab into an organization that oppresses Muslims in an effort to win control of Somalia."" Even longtime supporters and friends, such as Ibrahim al Afghani, turned against Zubayr, and paid with their lives. Al Afghani was killed in a shootout in June 2013 in the southern town of Barowe. The Mogadishu source told CNN that prominent figures in Al-Shabaab -- including Sheikh Mukhtar Robow and Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys -- now fear for their lives. Zubayr's purge accelerated during the summer of 2013, leading Aweys to negotiate his surrender to authorities, apparently for his own protection. After a Kenyan-led military operation pushed Al-Shabaab out of population centers in 2011, pro-al Qaeda hawks within the group gained the upper hand. The loss of the port city of Kismayo, the source of much of Al-Shabaab's income, weakened arguments that the group had too much to lose by embracing al Qaeda's global jihad. One reason Zubayr has emerged triumphant in these internal battles is that he controls Al-Shabaab's intelligence wing, known as Amniyat, a ruthless entity organized in cells and commanded by Mahad Mohamed Ali, also known as ""Karate."" Counterterrorism analysts say that as other units in the group have been weakened, Zubayr has come to rely heavily on Amniyat, which he sees as the kernel for Al-Shabaab's transformation into a regional al Qaeda affiliate. Zubayr's reliance on force in an organization that has long worked as a loose collective has made him a legion of enemies inside Somalia, and even led to criticism on some jihadist forums sympathetic to al Qaeda. After the Westgate attack, Kenyan and Western intelligence agencies stepped up efforts to end Zubayr's reign of terror, but it remains unclear if this week's airstrike against him succeeded.

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William called for global action Wednesday to stop the illegal wildlife trade that's devastating populations of some of the world's most magnificent wild animals -- including elephants, rhinos and tigers. The prince spoke at a meeting of United for Wildlife, a body bringing together his royal foundation and the world's leading wildlife charities, in London. The conference is part of a week of events aimed at galvanizing efforts to halt the slaughter of endangered animals for their bones, hides or tusks -- much in demand in parts of Asia. On Thursday, William and his father, Prince Charles, will be among the high-profile global guests due to attend the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade, hosted by the UK government. Prince Charles, UK Prime Minister David Cameron and the Presidents of Botswana and Gabon are all expected to speak at the event. William pledged Wednesday that United for Wildlife, of which he's president, would use its global leverage to make a difference at a time when the trade takes the lives of 100 elephants a day. ""The forces that are currently destroying some of the world's endangered species are sophisticated and powerful,"" the Duke of Cambridge said. ""But this week, we are seeing the creation of an equally powerful alliance, coming together to help fight them. ""The commitments set out today will begin to address the challenges of protection, enforcement and demand reduction. We will use our combined resources to ensure they succeed."" The organization plans to use ""smart"" technology such as GPS trackers and drones to protect animals at risk. It also intends to work with governments and local bodies to send out the message that no one should trade or buy rhino horn, ivory, tiger or pangolin parts and products. United for Wildlife will also bolster efforts to bring those involved in the illegal wildlife trade to justice and to support local communities whose livelihoods are affected by the trade, it said. Estimate: Rhino killed every 11 hours . The call to action comes in the face of horrifying statistics. More than 10% of the total African elephant population has been slaughtered for ivory in two years, according to the Zoological Society of London, which calls it ""a death toll the species simply cannot sustain."" Since the turn of this century, more than 1,000 tigers have been poached -- a huge number considering there are thought to be no more than 3,500 left in the wild. The rate of rhino poaching in Africa reportedly increased by 43% between 2011 and 2012 and is still going up. Since 2013, a rhino is estimated to have been killed every 11 hours by poachers, the Zoological Society of London says. U.S. President Barack Obama signed off Tuesday on a ""National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking,"" which sets out ways to stem the illegal trade. Its stated priorities are to strengthen enforcement, reduce demand for illegally trafficked wildlife and work more closely with international partners. ""Wildlife trafficking is both a critical conservation concern and a threat to global security with significant effects on the national interests of the United States and the interests of our partners around the world,"" the document says. It acknowledges the United States is ""among the world's major markets for wildlife and wildlife products, both legal and illegal"" but also points to demand for ivory and rhino horn in Asia, ""from a rapidly expanding wealthy class that views these commodities as luxury goods that enhance social status."" 'If we fail, it will be too late' William and Charles released an unusual joint video message Sunday that urged people worldwide to take a stand. But William, who has been a patron since 2005 of the wildlife conservation charity Tusk Trust, faced criticism Saturday in UK newspaper The Sun for reportedly going on a boar hunting trip to Spain with his brother, Prince Harry. Wild boar are legally hunted in the country, but the timing of the trip raised questions, it said. ""Prince William has gone shooting -- a day before launching a campaign to stop wildlife being killed,"" the popular tabloid said. In the joint video, recorded in November, Charles said it was time to treat the effort to stop the illegal wildlife trade ""like a battle, because it is precisely that."" He pointed to the sophisticated weaponry used by poachers and the threat that such criminal activity poses to economic and social stability in the countries affected. William said that he and his father were optimistic the ""tide can be reversed."" ""We have to be the generation that stopped the illegal wildlife trade, and secured the future of these magnificent animals, and their habitats, for if we fail, it will be too late,"" the younger prince adds. William, whose wife Catherine gave birth to their son George last summer, said that since becoming a father, he has become ""even more devoted to protecting the resources of the Earth for not only my own son but also the other children of his generation to enjoy."" The video, which was recorded in November, ends with the pair saying the phrase ""Let's unite for wildlife!"" in Arabic, Vietnamese, Swahili, Spanish and Mandarin. The aim is to be understood by as many people as possible living in the countries most affected by the illegal wildlife trade.

"(CNN) -- Midway through his presidency, George W. Bush was asked by the journalist John Dickerson to name his biggest mistake since 9/11 and what he'd learned from it. Here's what he said: . ""Hmmm... I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I could plan for it. Uhhh...(six-second pause) ""John, I'm sure historians will look back and say, gosh, he could've done it better this way or that way. Uhhh...(five second pause). You know, I just -- uhhh - I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with answer, but it hadn't yet. ..."" Bush then babbled about how he would not have done anything differently in Afghanistan, how Saddam Hussein was a bad guy and how he was confident the truth would come out about weapons of mass destruction (Well, he was right about that.). After filling air and killing time with that nonsense, he tried to return to Dickerson's question. But Bush's eyes looked like a slot machine that had just hit BAR-APPLE-LEMON. He said: . ""I hope -- I don't want to sound like I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't -- heh, heh -- you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one."" (You can see it for yourself here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haQzdW7hg4A ) One of the biggest reasons Barack Obama is president -- and a Nobel Peace Prize winner -- is that he's not George W. Bush. This week he proved that again. Whereas Bush couldn't name a single mistake -- not, say, letting Osama bin Laden escape from Tora Bora, or refusing to allow weapons inspectors to ascertain that Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction, or backing economic policies that took the greatest budget surplus in American history and turned it into the biggest deficit in history -- Obama has stepped up. His statement on Tuesday was close, but no cigar. Refreshingly he acknowledged screw-ups and pledged to get to the bottom of the mistakes and correct them. He said, ""The system has failed in a potentially disastrous way. ... The intelligence community failed to connect those dots."" That was a good start, but it didn't go far enough for me -- nor, apparently, for our president. Because on Thursday he took full responsibility. ""Ultimately,"" he said, ""the buck stops with me. As president, I have a solemn responsibility to protect our nation and our people, and when the system fails, it is my responsibility."" Hallelujah! The president also released a report detailing the failures that allowed a man to very nearly kill 300 people on Christmas Day, he has ordered the government to enhance screening and detection, to increase the use of federal air marshals and to improve the dissemination and integration of intelligence. In short, our president is taking his responsibility to protect us more seriously than his political instinct to protect his own backside. What a change, what a relief, what a difference. In taking responsibility, Barack Obama did the right thing for our country and his presidency. He also showed that a skinny, thoughtful community organizer has a lot more guts than a blustering Ivy Leaguer posing as a cowboy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala recalls that George W. Bush couldn't name his biggest mistake .

"(CNN) -- American energy production is skyrocketing, and pundits are promising everything from millions of jobs to energy independence. All of this could be put in jeopardy, though, if we don't get serious about the accompanying risks and make sure that oil and gas development is done right. The United States is now the world's largest producer of natural gas. Meanwhile U.S. oil production increased last year by over 300 million barrels -- its biggest jump since the industry began in 1859. There's good reason to believe that these changes have created hundreds of thousands of jobs. Meanwhile increased production of cleaner burning natural gas has helped cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest level in more than a decade. And while claims of looming ""energy independence"" are wildly over the top, there's no question that the oil and gas boom is making the country more secure in the world. These changes are driven by a technique known as ""fracking,"" short for hydraulic fracturing, which is being used to produce oil and gas trapped in dense shale rock. Photos: Taking from the land: Oiling on Indian reservations . Drillers dig down thousands of feet underground, take a sharp turn, and then bore thousands of feet further sideways. Then they pump a mix of water, sand, and chemicals into the new L-shaped well, and detonate explosives to create tiny cracks in the surrounding shale. Oil and gas flows through those cracks and eventually up to the surface where it can be collected, shipped, and sold. The practice has raised alarm in many of the communities where it's used. People fear that their water will be contaminated by the chemicals that are used in fracking. They worry about earthquakes that have been reported near some places where disposal of water from fracking occurs. And they often bristle at how a sudden surge of workers and wealth transforms their neighborhoods overnight. These concerns have led to a moratorium on fracking in New York State, and efforts to pass similar restrictions by state and local governments elsewhere, from Colorado to Texas. People are right to insist that fracking is done safely, but they're wrong if they conclude that it can't be. The key is to drill down on the biggest problems and require drillers to address them. The first risk has to do with water. The problem isn't so much what's pumped underground -- it's borderline impossible for fracking chemicals to seep up from thousands of feet beneath the earth and into water supplies -- but what comes back out. Opinion: The myth of energy independence . When oil and gas are produced, they're accompanied by ""flowback water"", which contains a mix of toxic chemicals found underground. If drillers cut corners and don't dispose of that water right, it can contaminate local water supplies. Rules need to be in place -- and enforced aggressively -- to ensure that doesn't happen. The second danger has to do with air. Some drillers power their operations using diesel; others let gas seep out from their equipment. Both practices lead to local air pollution. And while the emissions from a single well might not be big, the impact of dozens of wells operating in the same area can be bad. These problems can be fixed -- diesel generators can be replaced with equipment that uses clean-burning gas, and leaks can be plugged -- but the rules need to be right. Perhaps the toughest challenge, though, is fitting fracking into communities that aren't used to intense industrial development. It's no surprise that concerns about fracking began to really rise in 2009, when the practice migrated from states like Texas and Louisiana, where oil and gas development is commonplace, to Pennsylvania, where oil production peaked in 1891. If local authorities do things like make sure roads are maintained, help workers get training so that they can join the oil and gas business if they want to, and protect people on pensions who often struggle with rising living costs in boom towns, everyone can win. If they don't, though, the intense fights that result between winners and losers from energy production can be paralyzing. Opinion: Don't let America get 'fracked' A lot of enthusiasts for oil and gas are hostile to new rules. They say that companies are already doing the right thing and warn that extra costs could kill the industry. It's true that many companies are ahead of the curve when it comes to social and environmental responsibility; some are even working actively with local and environmental groups to ensure that they pursue development right. But the dangers don't come from the good guys -- they come from the laggards who screw things up. Reining them in can't be done just through voluntary steps. That makes it a relief that, while dumb regulation could indeed be crushing, smart rules would not. (By one estimate, a suite of twenty-two tough requirements, including greater disclosure of fracking fluids and tighter standards for cementing wells, would add at most 7% to the cost of a well.) The biggest risk for fracking, and to all the benefits it brings, isn't that drillers will have to spend a bit more to make sure that oil and gas production proceeds safely. It's that they won't -- and that the resulting backlash when things inevitably go wrong will deal the U.S. power surge a far more severe blow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Levi.","U.S. energy production has surged, largely due to fracking for natural gas .

"(CNN) -- 1914 was a good year for poster design. You'd be forgiven for not knowing it was then that five of the world's top poster designers were born: Tom Eckersley, Abram Games, FHK Henrion, Josef Müller-Brockmann and Paul Rand. Though they were from different backgrounds and worked separately, the five are largely responsible for bringing modernist design and typeface sensibilities to the world of poster design from the 1940s on. ""It was a sort of Golden Age of the poster,"" says legendary letterpress designer Alan Kitching. While their names have all but slipped from public memory, a new project from Kitching and Monotype, one of the world's leading typeface design companies, is shining a new light on their revolutionary poster work, 100 years after their birth. The results: a series of posters fusing each designer's style with Kitching's, and ""Alan Kitching and Monotype: Celebrating the centenary of five pioneers of the poster,"" an exhibition at the London College of Communication for the London Design Festival, that will showcase Kitching's work alongside posters from each designers' estate. The artist at work . I meet Kitching at his workshop near the London College of Communication. The smell of ink and metal hits you at the door, growing stronger as you move closer to the intimidating printing press in the back. Prints of his work—eye-popping text images in rainbow hues—hang from the walls, the ceiling, a drying line. The hundreds of typeface alphabets he's made and amassed over the years (the largest collection in Europe), from indecipherably small metal nubs to wooden letters the size of a man's forearm, are filed away in stacked tiers, and leaned against walls. His only computer is a first-generation MacBook he uses to check emails. Over the last 50 years, Kitching has built a reputation as one of the world's most acclaimed letterpress designers. And like the designers he's commemorating, he's inspired by the beauty of type. ""The printed word is still powerful,"" he says. ""I wanted to take letterpress technology and move it somewhere else from when it used to be useful."" This dedication to type as art is evident in the prints he created for the collaboration. The colorful posters meld Kitching's penchant for monograms (""I like that idea of monograms: two letters interacting to make a third image,"") with each designer's spirit. Their influences resonate like a baseline: Games' initials feature the bold font made famous by his posters for the Auxiliary Territorial Service (the women's branch of the British army) during World War II; Rand's feature the colorful simplicity that he would later bring to children's books. Posters, now and then . Kitching is quick to distinguish his posters from those being commemorated. While he has done functional posters, most of his have been designed as prints, strictly things of beauty. But earlier in the 20th-century, when the designers were first breaking ground in graphic design, posters were society's primary form of communication. ""There were no other means of getting your message out there then. It was just posters,"" he says. In a time before the ubiquity of photography (let alone Photoshop), good design was paramount. It was all about the ""interpretation of an idea in a graphic way."" For these artists, this interpretation was realized through geometric shapes, meaningful text and inventive use of color. The diversity of their work proved these principles could be applied for almost any cause, from Eckersley's simple-but-effective posters for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, to Rand and Henrion's branding work for IBM and KLM respectively; from Games' provocative war propaganda to Müller-Brockmann's geometric orchestra adverts. ""There's nothing between the message and the image. At a glance, you've got it. You didn't need a lot of words. The image is the message,"" Kitching says. ""That's what they were masters of: condensing down a problem to a single cool item with bang."" The public generally responded positively (Games' Guinness posters were universal favorites), but each designer received their share of push-back. One of Games' ATS recruitment posters was recalled after only a few weeks because authorities thought the glamorous woman shown sent the wrong message about the war effort, and another depicting a young boy in poverty was banned by Winston Churchill himself for being too negative. The others' posters were derided for being too strange, too modern, and too ugly. ""A lot of people didn't recognize the things they did,"" Kitching explains. ""They thought they were too advanced, too modern because they were working ahead of their time, really."" Yet somehow their legacy survives. The end of an era . Much has changed since Eckersley, Games, Henrion, Müller-Brockmann, and Rand elevated the poster to high art. Changing technology has rendered their methods obsolete, and posters have had to become more brash and stylized to keep the public's attention. ""A lot of things today have very fleeting life. It's ephemeral. It comes out quickly and it certainly doesn't last that long,"" Kitching says. But the appeal of these modernist designs, now decades old, remains. Posters that were quite common during their time now sell for exorbitant prices at auction. And to Kitching and other designers, they are a vestige of another time when a handful of great designers ruled supreme. ""They were regarded as the high professional designers of the world,"" Kitching says. ""Even now, people look back at them and say, 'That was a great time to be doing posters.'"" Alan Kitching will be speaking about the designers at Five Lives in Posters: A Panel Discussion at the London College of Communication on September 18, 2014.

"(CNN) -- As Germany's switchover from nuclear power to renewable energy gathers pace, concerns are mounting over the cost to the country's prosperity and its already squeezed consumers. Politicians in Europe's largest economy want renewable power to contribute 35% of the country's electricity consumption by 2020 and 80% by 2050 as part of its clean energy drive. The country's ""energiewende"" -- translated as energy transformation -- is part of the government's plan to move away from nuclear power and fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, following Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011. Michael Limburg, vice-president of the European Institute for Climate and Energy, told CNN that the government's energy targets are ""completely unfeasible."" ""Of course, it's possible to erect tens of thousands of windmills but only at an extreme cost and waste of natural space,"" he said. ""And still it would not be able to deliver electricity when it is needed."" The government is investing heavily in onshore and offshore wind farms and solar technology in an effort to reduce 40% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Last year Chancellor Angela Merkel, who this week won her third term as Germany's leader, proposed to construct offshore wind farms in the North Sea, a plan that would cost 200 billion euros ($270 billion), according to the DIW economic institute in Berlin. As part of the energy drive, Merkel also pledged to permanently shut down the country's 17 nuclear reactors, which fuel 18% of the country's power needs. Under Germany's Atomic Energy Act, the last nuclear power plant will be disconnected by 2022. Limburg told CNN the rapid transition to renewables is economically ""insane,"" arguing that wind farms will cost at least 13 times more than traditional coal plants. He added: ""Offshore wind is somewhat better in performance, cost and usability but still you have to spend six times as much as what you have to spend for a conventional power plant."" Paying the cost of renewable energy . Germans are already facing some of the highest energy bills in Europe. According to the Institute for Energy Research, this year German electricity rates will increase by over 10% due to a surcharge for using more renewable energy and a further 30 to 50% price increase is expected in the next ten years. Blackouts are another problem facing Germany's energy industry. With the bulk of wind turbines located in the east of the country, regional electricity grids face the threat of overloading, while the reliability of regular wind and solar power in northern Europe is also a concern. Claudia Kemfert, professor of energy economics at the German Institute for Economic Research, told CNN Germany's continued use of coal and fossil fuels to power its industrial hubs is making investors nervous. She said: ""Politicians give the wrong signals. They say 'well, on the one hand, we would like to have the energy transition, on the other hand...' what they do or what they propose is the opposite."" But Kemfert added that Germany is not in danger of an energy crisis and that a boom in renewables will have long term economic advantages. She said: ""North (Sea) wind farms can provide 25% of electricity production. Onshore wind could produce a higher share. Offshore wind energy is important for North Germany as already a lot of jobs have been created."" Germany is one of six European countries to invest in wind farms including the UK, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium. And Stefan Bourgeois, head of regulatory affairs at the European Wind Energy Association, told CNN the sooner the continent moves away from ""dirty fuels,"" such as coal, the better. He said: ""The costs of offshore are ahead of us, that is true... but the quicker everyone goes offshore the quicker the economies of scale and the costs come down.""","German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to permanently shut down the country's 17 nuclear reactors by 2022 .

"Rustenburg, South Africa (CNN) -- More South African mine workers gathered Wednesday, signaling growing instability and labor woes in the nation's platinum industry days after police killed dozens of protesters. Mine workers rallied at Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine, which is owned by local tribe Royal Bafokeng. ""The situation is stable, is being monitored and management is preparing for engagement,"" said Mzila Nthenjane, a company executive. He declined to provide additional details, saying the company will release more information after officials tend to the situation. At nearby Anglo American Platinum mine, a group of workers gave management until Friday to respond to a list of demands. ""We encourage our workers to utilize existing channels in place to address any upcoming issues,"" said Mpumi Sithole, a company spokeswoman. She did not specify what the demands were, but she said workers have not made any threats to go on strike. Both companies operate mines near the Lonmin facility, where clashes between police and mine workers left 34 people dead August 16. Lonmin is the world's third-largest platinum producer. In the Lonmin protests, thousands of rock drillers, who earn up to $500 a month, demanded an increase to $1,500 a month. Lonmin rejected the demand and called the strike illegal. Negotiations between strikers and the company broke down after a week of rising tensions, leading to a standoff as police fenced in machete-armed protesters with barbed wire, according to authorities. Protesters moved toward police, forcing authorities to drive them back with tear gas and rubber bullets, officials said. Officers used live ammunition when protesters defied their orders to stop attacking, said police Commissioner Riah Phiyega. At least 34 people died in a hail of gunfire; 78 others were wounded. In the days preceding the shootings, 10 people were hacked to death, including two police officers. Authorities did everything in their power to avoid the fatal clash with miners, the South African minister of police said. ""The events ... were not (a) sudden eruption but a culmination of events that were building over months and months,"" Nathi Mthethwa said. Rivalry between two unions that wield significant power and influence also intensified the Lonmin protests. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. The mine has reopened, and some workers have resumed working, according to Lonmin. A memorial service is scheduled for Thursday at the spot where miners and police clashed.","Mine workers gather at Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine .

"(CNN) -- Angola's ruling party held a big lead Saturday as the southern African nation posted preliminary results in its benchmark national election. With almost 70% of the vote counted, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) had almost 75% of the vote. Friday's election was only Angola's third since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Under the terms of a constitution approved in 2010, the leader of the party that wins Friday's parliamentary vote will automatically become Angola's president. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has held power since 1979, had been widely expected to retain the top spot as the head of the MPLA. After independence, Angola suffered through 27 years of civil war. Friday's election were widely viewed as an indicator of the country's progress after a decade of peace. Elections in 1992 were abandoned midway and led to an outbreak of further violence. The MPLA won the 2008 parliamentary vote with a landslide 82%. It appeared from early results that the MPLA was headed for another comfortable victory. The main opposition party and a former civil war enemy of the MPLA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), is among the nine political parties and coalitions contesting the election for 220 members of the National Assembly. UNITA won about 18% of the vote in the preliminary results. Seven other parties split up the rest of the vote. UNITA has alleged fraud in previous elections and again voiced concerns about apparent irregularities in election campaigning this time around. But on Saturday, spokesman Alcides Sakala said the party would recognize the election results, the official Angola News Agency reported. They include the scheduling of the vote only three days after a public holiday for the president's birthday, questions about voter rolls, and ""what seems like a concerted effort by certain security forces to tell people in rural areas that if they do not vote for the ruling party, the country will be back to war,"" said Domingos Jardo Muekalia, UNITA's deputy secretary for external relations, speaking at the Chatham House think tank in London. In 1992 and 2008, there were ""substantial irregularities -- some intentional such as manipulation, fraud and intimidation and others resulting from inexperience,"" he said. Human Rights Watch also accused the government of ""numerous incidents of political violence, intimidation of protesters, and crackdowns on peaceful demonstrations,"" in a report issued on August 1. ""The human rights environment in Angola is not conducive for free, fair and peaceful elections,"" said Leslie Lefkow, deputy Africa director for the rights monitoring group. ""The Angolan government needs to stop trying to stifle peaceful protests, gag the independent press or use the state media for partisan purposes if these elections are to be meaningful,"" Lefkow said. Angola, sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer, pumps out more than 1.9 million barrels per day and boasts an expanding investment portfolio in its former colonial power, Portugal, and in other parts of Africa. But despite big spending on infrastructure and social programs since the end of its brutal civil war in 2002, corruption, poor governance and economic inequality remain serious issues for much of the country's population of about 18 million. Angola ranked 168th out of 183 countries on Transparency International's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index, and was 148th out of 187 countries in the U.N.'s Human Development Index. A number of small but consistent demonstrations have taken place in Angola since last year, revealing a growing frustration with the economic hardship that many still face in the country. Over the last few months, civil war veterans have taken to the streets to demand overdue subsidy payments, and disgruntled youths and civil rights activists have staged rallies to voice their concerns about the lack of jobs and opportunities. The protracted civil war killed up to 1.5 million people, according to the CIA World Factbook. About 4 million people were internally displaced, more than half of them children, the United Nations said. After peace was established, the country faced the challenge of reestablishing civil institutions, rebuilding damaged infrastructure, clearing land mines and demobilizing large numbers of former fighters.

"(CNN) -- The Internet has erupted with outrage over the Copenhagen's Zoo's killing of a healthy young giraffe deemed surplus. Zoos are wholly artificial situations and their animals depend utterly on humans to decide their lives and their fate. That's obvious. Less obvious is that ""wild"" animals the world over now live in de-natured habitats, where humans also largely decide their lives and fate. Here where I live on Long Island, New York, townships of the posh East End are asking federal sharpshooters to kill thousands of deer over the next several years. Needless to say, there's been controversy. What does it mean to defend nature in a place like this? When people say there are ""too many"" deer, I ask, ""Too many for what?"" If the deer ate every grape in every vineyard and every potted plant on every doorstep, I wouldn't want anyone to kill them. We've put homes and farms onto their world, and I think it cruel of us to want to finish the job by killing what survives. You don't deserve to eat someone's lunch (or take a life) just because you've spread your blanket over their picnic. I have no patience for people who want to kill deer because they don't like the way deer fences look. I keep deer off my vegetables with flexible plastic bird netting; it's been 100% effective (and it's nearly invisible). I don't like to see taxpayers subsidizing farmers by killing deer at public expense, rather than farmers erecting fences. I'd rather subsidize fences; we subsidize enough bullets. But for me as an ecologist, those aren't the issues. The question is: What else is happening to remaining land and wildlife when we've killed all the predators of a large nibbling creature? I called Marguerite Wolffsohn, a naturalist whom I've known since we were just kids fresh out of college doing temporary nature-center gigs and looking for jobs. She found a job with the East Hampton's town planning department. (East Hampton canceled its intended participation in the deer kill this year because it had insufficient time for procedural requirements.) Better than anyone I know, Marguerite works thoughtfully within the totality of the East End deer proposal, the deer controversy, deer lovers and detesters, and—lest they get left out—the deer themselves. ""People against the plan to shoot deer feel that killing deer is killing nature,"" she said, ""but actually, the deer are killing nature."" Wildflowers, forests and other forest wildlife have all suffered, she says. ""The huge showy lupine displays of 20 years ago have disappeared. Pink lady's slipper orchids: They're another good example, practically gone."" The forested areas of the East End now have very little undergrowth—deer have eaten it. Wolffsohn's husband, John, a former park ranger and a keenly observing naturalist, added, ""I defy you to find a single hickory, sassafras, beech or oak seedling around here."" And along with the demise of the forest understory went the birds who made a living there. ""We don't hear hermit thrushes and wood thrushes in the woods behind our house anymore, and very few towhees,"" Wolffsohn says, ""And I wouldn't be surprised if the disappearance of whip-poor-wills here over the last 30 years""—they nest on the ground, in shady areas—""is partly deer-related."" Bobwhite quail, common in our youth and also ground-nesting, have also all but disappeared. Wolffsohn explains that by munching away the forest understory, deer set the stage for an explosion of invasive non-native plants. Garlic mustard is one. ""Deer won't eat it and its toxins inhibit other plants, so it just takes over,"" she says. ""Japanese barberry is another."" Some birds do eat barberries. Mockingbirds, for instance, rely partly on barberries for winter survival. But the other thing to which barberry bushes give a winter-survival boost is ticks. Barberry bushes create conditions of moisture favorable to ticks. And high densities of deer directly promote high densities of ticks because deer are suitable hosts for the same ticks that spread very nasty diseases like Lyme and babesiosis to humans. So, too many deer for what? Too many for forests and for other creatures and for human health. Ironically, for decades from the mid-1900s through the 1960s, wildlife management was largely focused on reversing the near-extinction of white-tailed deer. For centuries after Europeans arrived here, deer were shot relentlessly for their value in meat and skin. It's no coincidence that a dollar is called ""a buck."" Natives had of course hunted them for millennia but never with the thorough efficiency of Europeans. As weapons improved and farms spread, deer vanished from most of their former range. So did their main predators, wolves. U.S. government agents exterminated wolves south of Canada. Wildlife managers scrambled to prevent deer extinction while promoting recreational hunting, in part by ruthlessly suppressing wolves and other four-legged hunters. Without predators, the deer slowly but increasingly did their part, fruitfully multiplying. Then suburbs gave them refuge from human hunters. People had missed deer so much that lawns sprouted statues of deer ""families""—proud buck, doe, spotted bambino. Suburbanites were thrilled to glimpse real live ones. For a few years it was a good time to be a deer. Deer deserve no blame for anything. Deer are innocents in a world we've put out-of-round. We first shot them to pieces and then set them up to explode without check. We provided incidental safe haven in our neighborhoods and now despise them there. None of the problems people have with deer are the deer's fault. I pity them for the dilemma we've placed them—and ourselves—in. There are too many deer because there are too many people. Deer do need population control. That, we have in common. But unlike with humans, you can't give fawns the opportunity to go to school and welcome each doe into the workforce and empower them to reduce their lifetime family size to an average of two. But perhaps there's a kinder and gentler way: letting sharpshooters administer birth control hormones rather than bullets? ""That doesn't work,"" Marguerite says. She e-mailed me the state's deer management document, which says, ""Based on considerable research on fertility control for deer ... this strategy has not proven to be a viable, stand-alone option for managing free-ranging deer populations."" If you want to bring deer densities down, you have to kill them. For millions of years, that was the arrangement wrought by the interacting forces of wolves and other creatures, landscapes and deer themselves. A creature evolved to have two children per year is reliant on predators to keep its world balanced. Without predators in a world of our making, the current density of deer is a problem. And not just for us. There is no pain-free alternative for the deer themselves. Without being killed by predators or bullets, deer build to densities that suffer high rates of traffic collision and the misery of high winter starvation. In parts of the West, wolves are returning, with very beneficial re-balancing effects on lands and wildlife. Even there, many people detest wolves with a hatred that is cultural and mainly irrational, largely out of sync with, and wholly out of proportion to, reality. Giving wolves back their job of managing deer, so difficult out West where there's room, is wholly impossible here. For now, it looks like we're stuck with having to deal lethally with innocents in a problem we've created. It's grim that only the deer will get the shifted blame, take the rap and suffer the consequences. All too human. Copenhagen's giraffe was deemed ""surplus"" by the zoo—not enough room, they insisted, for a responsibility of their own creation. Marius the giraffe paid full price in full innocence. But almost anywhere you look now there is less and less room on an ark having trouble floating in a rising sea of us. And so often, we blame the victims. They say the most intelligent animals are those who recognize themselves in a mirror. We should try it sometime.

"(CNN) -- Every parent loves his or her child; it's the prime directive of the species. Twenty years ago, when my wife was pregnant with our first baby, Hillary Clinton told me that having a child is like taking your heart out of your body and letting it walk around. For some parents, however, their beloved child takes their heart on a long, wild ride that careers from joyous and generous to dark and dangerous. So it was with John Schwartz and Jeanne Mixon. Joseph, their third child, was a precocious reader, a super-sensitive old soul, fiercely defiant when he believed the teacher was too autocratic, hyper-quick on the trigger. Or, as his father put it, a squirrelly kid. He's also gay. Fabulously gay. From early childhood he preferred feather boas to football; pink shoes to playing soccer. No problem; his parents are enlightened, intelligent, educated, urbane and progressive. Their community in suburban New Jersey was welcoming and inclusive. Their rabbi is gay. iReport: Who's at your Thanksgiving table? And yet shortly after he came out of the closet at age 13, Joe attempted suicide. In his new book, ""Oddly Normal,"" Joseph's dad takes his readers through his family's years-long high-wire act: counselors and psychiatrists who tried to medicate their son; teachers who ranged from saintly to Nurse Ratched-like; thoughtful, caring professionals who struggled with a kid who didn't quite fit in the ""normal"" category, but whose peccadilloes and challenges also didn't fit within any of the prefab boxes. Joseph does not have Asperger's syndrome; he is not austic; he's not ADD or ADHD. He's just squirrelly. And gay. My take: 5 ways to raise thankful children . A national reporter for the New York Times, Schwartz mixes his family's personal journey with solid reporting on controversies like whether we are over-medicating our children, whether gay teens really are more prone to suicide, nature versus nurture and more. He writes like the pro he is, but this is not some dispassionate account of the social science of the suburbs. This is open-soul surgery without anesthetic. I have known and liked Schwartz and Mixon since college. They are smart and strong and loving. They need all of those attributes as they butt heads with educrats, shrinks and teachers as they fight for their bright, witty handful of a boy. Somehow -- maybe it's the journalistic training -- Schwartz is not harshly judgmental, even to Mr. Fourth Grade, a teacher who, he says, was especially harmful to Joseph. The only time his sense of fairness and perspective abandons him is when he turns his truth-beam on himself: Why didn't he act on the warning signs that were obvious in hindsight? Because, of course, they were not obvious then, camouflaged by routine and shrouded in fog. Every parent feels that way. Few can express it as fearlessly as Schwartz. ""Oddly Normal"" has a happy ending. Joseph himself provides a coda that will bring tears to your eyes. Schwartz's memoir is brave and beautiful, surprising and inspiring, a testament to parents' endless determination to help their children, and the bottomless capacity for love. It is by no means a How-To guide for raising a gay kid. It should be taken to heart by every parent. Living: Navigating family and dinner table etiquette landmines . As Schwartz writes, ""You don't have to be gay to understand that your own child might feel isolated, different. Alone on the planet. It's our job to love our little Martians whatever it is that makes them different."" As families gather for Thanksgiving, secrets and regrets are invariably on the menu. But so is love and acceptance -- especially in the best families, like the Schwartzes. Sure Uncle Walter will bloviate about his golf game, Aunt Claire will make catty comments about your weight, the cousins from California will be over-served. But I for one will thank God for family: the folks who fight for you when you're vulnerable, forgive you when you're wrong, and always, always love you -- even if you're a little squirrelly.

"(CNN) -- Could a massive passenger jet slip past radar, cross international borders and land undetected? That's a key question investigators are weighing as they continue the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished March 8 on a flight between Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Beijing. Radar does have some blind spots, and it's possible to fly at lower altitudes to avoid being spotted, analysts told CNN. But experts are divided over whether that could be what happened to the missing Boeing 777. Jeffrey Beatty, a security consultant and former FBI special agent, says someone could have planned a route that avoided radar detection. ""It certainly is possible to fly through the mountains in that part of the world and not be visible on radar. Also, an experienced pilot, anyone who wanted to go in that direction, could certainly plot out all the known radar locations, and you can easily determine, where are the radar blind spots?"" he said. ""It's the type of things the Americans did when they went into Pakistan to go after Osama bin Laden."" On Monday, the Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times reported that the plane may have flown low to the ground -- 5,000 feet or less -- and used mountainous terrain as cover to evade radar detection. The newspaper cited unnamed sources for its reporting, which CNN could not immediately confirm. And a senior Indian military official told CNN on Monday that military radar near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands isn't as closely watched as other radar systems. That leaves open the possibility that Indian radar systems may not have picked up the airplane at the time of its last known Malaysian radar contact, near the tiny island of Palau Perak in the Strait of Malacca. U.S. officials have said they don't think it's likely the plane flew north over land as it veered off course. If it had, they've said, radar somewhere would have detected it. Landing the plane somewhere also seems unlikely, since that would require a large runway, refueling capability and the ability to fix the plane, the officials have said. Malaysian officials said Monday that they were not aware of the Malaysian newspaper's report. ""It does not come from us,"" said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya. Analysts interviewed by CNN said that it would be extremely difficult to fly such a large aircraft so close to the ground over a long period of time, and that it's not even clear that doing so would keep the plane off radar scopes. ""Five-thousand isn't really low enough to evade the radar, and that's kind of where general aviation flies all the time anyway, and we're visible to radar,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""It just seems really highly improbable, unless we've been overestimating a lot of other countries' radar system capabilities,"" said Daniel Rose, an aviation and maritime attorney. Buck Sexton, a former CIA officer who's now national security editor for TheBlaze.com, said radar would have detected the plane if it flew over land. ""This is a bus in the sky. It's a lot harder to get under the radar with this kind of thing than I think most people realize,"" he said. ""So really, while the search I know has extended to this vast area stretching up into (the nations and central or south Asia), clearly there really should be much more of a search over open water, because this is not getting past people's radars."" It wouldn't be easy to avoid radar detection, experts say, but it could be done. ""Anything like this is possible,"" radar expert Greg Charvat told CNN's Piers Morgan Live. ""But to do it, you'd have to have very detailed information of the type of radars, their disposition, their heights and their waveforms to pull that off."" Different countries would likely be using different radar systems, he said, but it's unclear how advanced the technology is in many countries. ""It took a great deal of skill to do this,"" CNN aviation analyst Jim Tilmon said. ""I think somebody was at the controls who understood the value of altitude control to eliminate the possibility of being spotted and tracked on radar."" Whoever was in control in the cockpit, he said, ""really had the ability to map out a route that was given the very best chance of not being detected."" One other possibility, he said: the plane could have shadowed another plane so closely that it slipped by radar detection. Other analysts say that would require so much skill that it would be nearly impossible to pull off without getting caught. There's another possible wrinkle, experts say. Some countries may be hesitant to reveal what they've seen on radar. ""They want to protect their own capabilities,"" Beatty said. ""Their intelligence services are not going to want to publicize exactly what their capabilities are."" Here are other developments in the search and investigation, as search crews from 26 nations continue scouring vast swaths of ocean and land for any trace of the airliner: . Timeline clarification . Ahmad Jauhari said Monday that it wasn't clear whether the final words from the cockpit came before or after the plane's data-reporting system was shut down. Earlier, Malaysian authorities had said the message ""All right, good night"" came after the system had been disabled. The voice message came from the plane's copilot at 1:19 a.m. Saturday, March 8, Ahmad Jauhari said. The data system sent its last transmission at 1:07 a.m. and was shut down sometime between then and 1:37 a.m. that day, Ahmad Jauhari said. Grief counselor: Families holding on to hope . As authorities keep searching for the plane, the loved ones of the 239 passengers and crew members who were on board are left in limbo. Helping them has been difficult, grief counselor Paul Yin told CNN's ""AC360."" ""Grief counseling, or any kind of recovery from this, has to have a starting point. And the starting point is having a verdict of what happened,"" he said. ""Without a starting point, every day people's emotions go up and down, from hope to despair."" He heard some family members cheer when they learned that hijacking was possibly what caused the plane's disappearance. ""Because that means they could still be alive,"" he said. ""They're trying to hold onto any little bit of hope."" Chinese response . China said Monday that it had deployed 10 ships, 21 satellites and multiple aircraft to aid in the search. Premier Li Keqiang spoke with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to ask for more information to help speed the search along, according to a statement posted on the Chinese government website. A top Malaysian official denied the allegation that his country had held back information about the missing flight. ""Our priority has always been to find the aircraft. We would not withhold any information that could help,"" Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Haishammuddin Tun Hussein told reporters. ""But we also have a responsibility not to release information until it has been verified by the international investigations team."" U.S. Navy pulls out destroyer . The USS Kidd and its helicopters have stopped combing the Andaman Sea and are no longer part of search efforts for the missing plane, the Navy said. The move is partially because Australians are taking over the majority of the searching in that area, U.S. officials said. A U.S. P-8 aircraft will move to Perth, Australia, to be based there for searching. Fewer U.S. assets will be involved in the search for the missing plane, but U.S. officials said the P-8 will be able to cover a wider range of ocean more quickly than the ship could. ""This is actually much more effective for the overall search,"" Cmdr. William Marks of the U.S. 7th Fleet told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Monday. ""The real challenge is this huge expanse of water. I keep saying, if you superimposed a map of the U.S. on here, it'd be like trying to find someone anywhere between New York and California. so that's the challenge here,"" he said. ""We have amazing, dedicated air crews. it's just a matter of how much area we can search.""

"(CNN) -- Women age 60 and older have a 1 in 6 chance of getting Alzheimer's disease in their lifetime, and are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's compared with breast cancer, according to a report from the Alzheimer's Association. Men, by comparison, have a 1 in 11 chance of getting Alzheimer's, according to the 2014 Facts and Figures report. Age is the greatest risk factor for gender differences among Alzheimer's patients, but it's not the only reason. Researchers are also looking at genetic and hormonal differences, according to Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer's Association. The disease affects more than 5 million Americans, two-thirds of them women. The new details about this disease and its impact on women come from a survey of more than 3,000 women commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association. Overwhelming burden, cost of Alzheimer's to triple . Carol Moore, 75, is all too familiar with this gender disparity. She says she never worried about breast cancer because she was vigilant about her health, but thought her forgetfulness was just part of getting older. In 2012 she underwent a battery of screening tests for part of an Alzheimer's study. Much to her surprise, she was diagnosed with the disease. ""I was hoping against hope there was nothing wrong with me, but there was,"" she says, recalling her fear when the neurologist showed her the MRI of her brain and pointed out the deterioration. Women are also disproportionately affected when it comes to caring for people with Alzheimer's. Sixty percent of caregivers are women and the care they give is more intense physically and emotionally, according to the annual report. Graphic: Every 67 seconds, someone in the U.S. develops Alzheimer's . Women are more likely to provide round-the-clock care, including feeding, clothing and diapering, says Carrillo. The average length of time an Alzheimer's patient requires 24-hour care is four to seven years, but could be as long as 20 years. The cost of Alzheimer's care is estimated to be $214 billion for this year alone. ""We wish we had expensive treatments to brag about, but we don't, so it's important to highlight that research funding and research commitments are critical for us to change that balance,"" Carrillo says. In the future, she says, she hopes she'll be talking about the cost of treatments rather than the cost of care. Mortality rates for other diseases, like breast cancer, are dropping, but the rate of Alzheimer's deaths is on the rise. Alzheimer's toll may rank with cancer, heart disease . The impact on women disproportionately extends to the workplace as well, where 20% of women, as compared with 3% of men, switch from full-time to part-time work because of their responsibilities as caregivers. Additionally, women are more likely to take a leave of absence from work or stop working altogether. They also report feeling more isolated and depressed than their male counterparts. Another surprise from the report, although not specific to women: 24% of women and men mistakenly believe they are only at risk for Alzheimer's disease if they have a family member with it. The cultural breakdown is surprising as well, as 33% of Hispanics held this mistaken belief and nearly half of Asians did. ""Anyone with a brain is at risk,"" says Angela Geiger, chief strategy officer for the Alzheimer's Association. ""You can do everything 'right' and still not prevent Alzheimer's,"" according to the association's website. Risk factors for Alzheimer's include genetics and aging, which are out of your control. However, adopting what the association calls ""healthy brain life habits"" may help delay or prevent the appearance of the disease. Those habits include staying mentally, socially and physically active and adopting a ""brain-healthy diet"" low in fat and cholesterol. Women can also reduce some risk factors by watching their numbers, Carrillo says. That includes blood sugar levels if diabetic, blood pressure and cholesterol. The association is launching a new initiative in conjunction with the report, asking 1 million women to go to the association's website and share why their brain matters and how they will use it to stop Alzheimer's disease. In the meantime, Moore, who lives in suburban Atlanta, is taking medication to slow the progression of the disease. She lives alone, still drives and stays active by exercising and attending monthly group meetings with other Alzheimer's patients. She feels she'd be more social if she could, but she says she can't keep up the way she used to. ""I remind myself you just really have to do one thing at a time,"" she says. ""Needless to say, it's a frustration."" Blood test predicts Alzheimer's disease .","Women over 60 have a 1 in 6 chance of getting Alzheimer's disease .

"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden was right to call attention to New York's LaGuardia Airport. From the dilapidated state of LaGuardia's Central Terminal Building to the minimal public transport links and outdated air traffic control system, the metro area's airports are in desperate need of modernization. But now it's time for Biden and other leaders to put their money where their rhetoric is. The Federal Government and local politicians must step up and take sustained action. And the goal should be to fix the problem, not point fingers. Despite its outdated condition, LaGuardia serves 25 million passengers a year. As the closest airport to Manhattan, it is coveted by airlines. Moreover, New York City's three major airports serve more than 110 million people a year, account for 500,000 jobs and contribute $63 billion to our regional economy, according to a November 2013 study from Global Gateway Alliance and Partnership for New York City. And they are the largest global gateway to the world for international travelers, with U.S. Customs data showing that John F. Kennedy International Airport handles the most international visitors and Newark International Airport the fifth most. As such, the airports serve as a symbol for the entire United States. Airports are responsible for the first and last impressions visitors have, and in New York, some 54 million tourists visited last year. They are fundamentally vital to our economy, tourism industry and our global reputation. As the vice president pointed out, New York's airports are a symbol of underinvestment in infrastructure throughout the country. When the Beatles landed in New York 50 years ago last week, our airports were a symbol of the modern, efficient and forward-looking transportation infrastructure in the United States. Now, they are the embodiment of our falling behind the rest of the world. Cities all over the world have recognized the significance of their airports and have invested in state-of-the-art technology and infrastructure. Our own Global Gateway Alliance survey showed that airports from Singapore to Paris are providing innovative amenities such as 40 foot slides, ice skating rinks and on airport baby strollers to ensure that passengers have the best possible experience. The same survey showed LaGuardia and New York area airports at the bottom of the list of passenger amenities. The bottom line is we to have to invest in our airports to avoid losing out to national and international competitors and to provide a better quality of life for those millions of passengers. At LaGuardia, here's how: . -- 21st century terminals: LaGuardia's Central Terminal Building, built in 1964, is a prime example of an outdated terminal desperately in need of redevelopment, which is why it's so important for the Port Authority to deliver on the promise of a modern, efficient and innovative terminal. There are also significant space constraints with only two short runways and limited parking, which are challenges that need to be addressed. -- Better passenger amenities: Frequently voted the worst airport in the U.S. by passengers, LaGuardia is definitely not known for its amenities. All of the New York area airports would benefit from providing what are now basic services, such as free Wi-Fi, which would help business travelers, and leave visitors with a better impression of their time in New York. -- Improved transportation links: Public transportation access to all of New York's airports is behind other world class cities, which have one seat train rides directly from the city center to the airport. Options for getting to LaGuardia via public transportation are very limited, but a Bus Rapid Transit system, with dedicated lanes and just a few stops to the airport, would help remedy that. This service would remove the threat of traffic delays normally associated with buses and provide a convenient and reliable direct ride to the airport. Reviving long dormant plans for a direct subway extension to LaGuardia are also worth exploring. -- Bring NextGen to New York first: LaGuardia, along with JFK and Newark, is the most delayed airport traffic control system in the country. Every day, our airspace contributes to one half to three quarters of all delays around the country. The solution is NextGen, the new satellite-based air traffic control system. Replacing the old 1960s radar technology means fewer delays on the ground and in the air. But the FAA has to step up and make it happen in New York. Right now, the federal government is years behind in developing NextGen, and the FAA wants to roll it out in smaller markets first, despite the tremendous impact the New York airspace has on national delays. It's past time to stop ignoring our airports and to move them to the front of the priorities line. That's how LaGuardia will go from Third World to world class. The opinions expressed are solely those of the authors.","Vice President Biden compared LaGuardia Airport to being in a Third World country .

"(CNN) -- Saying that ""the darkest corners of the Internet"" pose a real threat to children, British Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday rolled out a plan that would, by default, block pornography on most computers, smartphones and tablets. British wireless and Internet providers have agreed to put adult-content filters on phones, public Wi-Fi networks and home computers in the coming months. By the end of the year, the filters will become the default setting for anyone setting up broadband Internet service at home, Cameron said. ""I'm not making this speech because I want to (moralize) or scare-monger, but because I feel profoundly as a politician, and as a father, that the time for action has come,"" Cameron said. ""This is, quite simply, about how we protect our children and their innocence."" All of those filters could be deactivated by those who can ""prove"" they are 18 or older, Cameron said. The plan is the result of a monthslong effort by Cameron to restrict access to Internet porn. He has called Google and other search companies into meetings, demanding they do more to hide porn from children, and appointed Parliament member Claire Perry as a special adviser targeting the issues. The plan will require no action from Parliament because service providers and other Web companies are participating voluntarily. Some already provide service with porn filters as their default settings. Not surprisingly, Web freedom advocates and other critics were quick to decry the plan. For one, many say effective Web filters simply don't exist. ""As a technological feat, it would be utterly impossible,"" columnist Andy Dawson wrote in the Daily Mirror, a nationwide tabloid frequently critical of Cameron's Conservative Party. ""His porn shield speech today, and the proposals that are in it are the deranged ravings of someone who has decided that something must be done, has decided what it is, but doesn't (realize) that it isn't actually feasible. He's got just as much chance of banning (gray) clouds while giving us all access to the nice white, fluffy ones."" Critics say that automated filtering technology inevitably allows offensive material through accidentally as well as creating ""false positives"" that block inoffensive content. Others, such as BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, say default-on filters can create a false sense of security among parents, who could become more lax in monitoring their children's online behavior. The Internet service providers that have signed off on the plan provide service to roughly nine out of 10 households in Great Britain. In his speech, Cameron cited a two-pronged problem: the online exploitation of children through child pornography and the easy access children have to otherwise legal pornography at an early age. ""In one we're talking about illegal material, the other legal material that is being viewed by those who are underage,"" he said. ""But both these challenges have something in common. They are about how our collective lack of action on the Internet has led to harmful -- and in some cases truly dreadful -- consequences for children."" The prime minister announced an effort to expand and streamline currently fragmented child-porn databases and a new interpretation of law that will make porn depicting rape illegal. He also announced a new ""Family Friendly Wi-Fi"" label that will allow hotels, restaurants and other businesses to advertise that the Web access they provide has porn filters enabled. Two recent British murder trials in which the defendants were each said to have viewed images of child sexual abuse online have heightened public concern over the issue. One case was that of April Jones, a 5-year-old girl whose disappearance last year in a remote part of Wales sparked a huge search. Mark Bridger was found guilty of her murder in May, but her body has still not been found. The other was the murder of a 12-year-old girl, Tia Sharp, by her grandmother's partner. Cameron said he had met with the parents of those two girls on Friday. ""Protecting the most vulnerable in our society, protecting innocence, protecting childhood itself -- that is what is at stake,"" Cameron said. ""And I will do whatever it takes to keep our children safe.""","British Prime Minister David Cameron is cracking down on Internet porn .

"(CNN) -- Could the days of trying to cram all your professional accomplishments onto a single sheet of paper be a thing of the past? Some job experts say we're already there. With news that Facebook might be joining the ranks of online-employment brokers, it's looking more and more like the old-fashioned resume might be growing obsolete. Facebook plans to launch its own jobs board, working with some existing sites to let users search listings, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. Yes, that's right: People may be looking for jobs on the same site where photos of their youthful indiscretions could turn off potential employers. It's not certain whether such a Facebook feature will pan out (Facebook isn't commenting, and the Journal cites unnamed sources). But in many ways, we're already in a post-resume era. What hiring manager is going to make a decision based on an e-mail attachment when they can browse your LinkedIn and Facebook profiles, read the gory details in your blog and hit Google to find out more about you -- good or bad -- all in one sitting? And paper resumes? Forget it. Between desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones, some hiring experts say there's little reason to peruse a dead-tree summary of someone's career anymore. ""I don't ever have anybody come in and hand me a paper resume,"" said Gretchen Gunn, a principal at MGD Services, a staffing firm in Stockton, New Jersey. ""Ten years ago, your fax machine was loaded when you came in in the morning. Not anymore."" Gunn blogged about the trend in January, writing that when someone hands her a paper resume at a job fair, she hands it back and asks for an e-mail. Why? ""Because that paper resume has little chance of leaving my roll-along briefcase, which houses my laptop, iPad and other electronics,"" she wrote. ""Our entire recruiting process is now online."" Technically, Rachael King, who works on community engagement in San Francisco for software company Adobe, submitted a resume for her job. But it was just one digital blip that was ""pinned"" on a Pinterest board she created. Other pins included a listing of her public speaking engagements, links to news articles in which she'd appeared, her blog and even an article on how to build a resume on Pinterest. She dubbed it her ""Living Resume,"" what she called ""an ongoing collection of decidedly cool things I've done in my career, side gigs, and other projects."" Some companies, especially those in the tech world, are going even further, saying they're no longer interested at all in an applicant's tried-and-true laundry list of jobs, education, awards and activities. Hiring managers often can gain a better sense of a person's judgment, personality and communication skills by perusing their Twitter feeds or Tumblr posts, they say. Union Square Ventures, a New York venture-capitalist firm that invests heavily in tech start-ups, hired two analysts last month after a search that started last fall. But instead of soliciting resumes when the positions were announced, the firm asked for a glimpse at applicants' ""Web presence."" ""This could be anything from a Twitter account to a blog or Tumblr to a project you hacked together -- whatever represents you best,"" Union Square's Christina Cacioppo wrote on the company's site at the time. ""We expect your Web presence to represent who you are, not who you think an employer wishes you were, so please don't waste time sanitizing your Web presence before sending us there. We get it."" Applicants also were asked to create two Web videos of themselves, one saying why they wanted the job and the other answering the question:'""Which Web or mobile services most inspire you?"" Gunn doesn't think most employers are going to go that far, at least not in the near future. But she already uses many of the tools Union Square did to augment what a job applicant provides on their own. ""We look at Facebook; we look at LinkedIn,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military did major damage to the site of one of the wonders of the ancient world while converting it into a base, the United Nations said in a new report. An U.S. soldier looks over the ancient city of Babylon in Iraq in 2004. The site of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon was converted into Camp Alpha shortly after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. The troops and their contractors caused ""major damage"" by digging, cutting, scraping and leveling while they were revamping the site to meet military standards, the U.N. cultural agency, UNESCO, said in a report. ""Key structures that were damaged include the Ishtar Gate and the Processional Way,"" the report added. The Ishtar Gate, an entrance to the northern part of the city, is decorated with animals that portray the symbol of the god of the city of Babylon. ""Damage to the gate includes smashed bricks on nine of the bodies of the animals adorning the gate,"" according to the report. A military official said she had not seen the U.N. report, but added that one of the reasons troops set up a base at the site was to safeguard it. ""Coalition forces first occupied the Babylon site in April 2003 during the ground campaign of Operation Iraqi Freedom with a purpose, among others, of protecting the ruins from looting after the provincial museums in Babylon and Kufa were robbed of their entire contents,"" said Lt. Col. Tamara Parker, a spokeswoman. ""U.S. forces respect historical sites in Iraq,"" she added. The United Nations lists additional damage to the site, including trenches used as firing positions and barbed wire secured to various spots. The stakes used to set up the barbed wire damaged walls, according to the report. Babylon, an hour's drive south of Baghdad, dates to ancient Mesopotamia. The city on the banks of the Euphrates River was the home of Hammurabi and later Nebuchadnezzar, who built the famous gardens for his wife. Alexander the Great wished to make Babylon his capital, but died before realizing his plan. During colonial times, archaeologists hauled off Babylon's artifacts to Europe. Some of those artifacts can be seen in a museum in Berlin, Germany. The site was occupied by Camp Alpha from September 2003 till December 2004, the report said. The United States has agreed to pay $800,000 to help rehabilitate the Babylon site, an Iraqi official said. ""We were very disappointed when multinational forces took over these ancient sites as bases although they knew how important these sites are to Iraqis and to the entire world,"" said Abdulzahra al-Talaqani, spokesman for the ministry of tourism. Plans are under way to clean up the area in August with the help of hundreds of volunteers, according to al-Talaqani. The U.N. report noted that U.S. troops were not solely responsible for ruining the 4,000-year-old city. Before their arrival, local residents had contributed to the damage, mostly through development, the report said. ""The features of the western side of the city of Babylon disappeared many years ago due to encroachment by agriculture and development on the archaeological zone,"" the report said.","U.N. report claims U.S. troops damaged city of Babylon during Iraq invasion .

"(CNN) -- Nine civilians died in an attack on a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital, a government official said Friday. The dead were a mix of Afghans and foreigners, children and adults, according to Gen Mohammad Ayoub Salangi the deputy interior minister. Six people were also injured. The incident began when four teenagers entered the Serena Hotel in central Kabul on Thursday and started shooting randomly, police said. Afghan security forces killed the four gunmen, who police said were all under 18 and were ""government opponents."" Police said they believe the gunmen entered the hotel by smuggling small pistols in their shoes, then hid in the bathroom for several hours before launching their attack. The hotel also was the site of a shooting, in January 2008, that killed seven people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. This is latest attack to claim the lives of foreigners in the Afghan capital. Earlier this month, gunmen shot and killed a Swedish journalist in broad daylight. In January, a bomb and gun attack by the Taliban on a restaurant in Kabul killed 21 people, most of them foreigners. Earlier, in eastern Afghanistan, Taliban militants stormed a police station in Jalalabad, and a deadly gunbattle ensued, the country's Interior Ministry said. At least 11 people were killed and 22 were injured at the station, and at least six attackers were killed, according to a doctor at the hospital. This came as the militant group threatened to carry out attacks before next month's presidential election. Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed the action to CNN. He said fighters will ""continue to attack the pro-U.S. Afghan establishment."" Canada pulls out of Kabul as NATO winds down Afghan operations .

"(CNN) -- Here's what you need to know about Pauly Shore: You can't make any joke about him that he hasn't made about himself, because he loves to play the victim. ""It's like a roast. Or Rodney Dangerfield with 'No Repsect,' "" he says. ""I giggle when I put myself down. It's just funny to me."" After his glory days of chilling major as the Weasel on MTV and his foray into mainstream movies with stoner comedies like ""Encino Man"" and ""Bio-Dome,"" Shore's career stalled. It was when the offers dried up that Shore took matters into his own hands and created a new character: self-deprecating former star. He threw himself into stand-up and began creating starring roles for himself once again with independent films that he wrote, directed and produced. ""You've got two choices,"" he says. ""You can either make a s--tload of money -- not me personally, but someone in the business who's very box office-friendly -- being cast in other people's stuff or do what I'm doing and not make any money but be 100% in control of it and make it exactly how I want it to be."" His latest project is a comedy special, ""Vegas is My Oyster,"" airing on Showtime now. ""Oyster"" is a throwback to old-time variety shows, and in it, Shore plays the emcee and straight man trying to corral wildcards like Andy Dick and Tom Green during the AVN Awards weekend in Las Vegas. Former Charlie Sheen goddess Bree Olson, Ron Jeremy, Dave Navarro, Bobby Lee and Amber Lancaster also make appearances. ""It's quite a feat to try and pull off a show with all these people, getting them there, having them show up that night sober and looking good,"" Shore said. But after contemplating every painstaking detail, down to which scalloped curtain to hang on stage, he's proud of his work. ""It's shot well; it's sexy; it's no-holds-barred and edgy. My main goal is to do something entertaining, and we're pushing the envelope on this particular show. I loved having the porno awards be the backdrop."" Shore is no stranger to a fast lifestyle. His comedian father, Sammy, was Elvis Presley's opening act and founded The Comedy Store in Los Angeles. His mother, Mitzi, has been running the club since 1973. From an early age, Shore was around lady-loving, hard-partying legends like Sam Kinison and Richard Pryor. Back in his MTV days, he romped with ""Lisa Lisa,"" and he's been a frequent guest at the Playboy mansion. ""I think I'm living a lot of guys' dreams. For sure,"" he says. ""But I am a guilt-free person,"" he continues. ""Unlike Tiger Woods or Arnold Schwarzenegger or any of these guys that live the unfaithful, cheating lie, or even women who live that lie, I'm not that person. I was when I was younger, but I chose the wrong girls to date. Now I still choose those girls, but I also know that it's not going anywhere. I don't promise them anything; they don't promise me anything. It's very light. I have enough drama in my own life. Plus, I like having different girlfriends in different places that I travel."" If Shore, 43, were to settle down, he says a Sharon Osbourne type is his ideal. ""At the end of the day, I think, don't quote me on this -- and you can even say don't quote me -- that's probably the type of girl that I would wind up with. She loves him and protects him but also manages him and cares for him. I think if Ozzy didn't have Sharon, he would be dead by now."" Until that love comes along for him, Shore will be on the road. ""Remember that (Life cereal) commercial, 'I know, let's get Mikey to do it!' I'm like the Mikey of comedians,"" he says. ""I go to markets that no one would ever go to. Those are my fans. People always ask me, who are your fans? My fans are people that live in Jackson, Michigan, and also (the) TSA. They love me.""","His latest project is a comedy special, ""Vegas is My Oyster,"" airing on Showtime .

"(CNN) -- Cheers in Moscow. Fear in Kiev. And jeers from the West. When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region Tuesday and signed a formal decree, he made a major European crisis almost irreversible. His nation's lawmakers wept and gave him a standing ovation in parliament as he barraged the West for what he described as its numerous betrayals. But in Western capitals, there was no applause. Governments imposed sanctions on Russian leaders and warned that's just the beginning. Here's the rationalization for Putin's decision, and the reasoning for the West's derision. POINT . Crimea rightfully belongs to Russia . Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. At the time, no one thought the Soviet Union would collapse, Putin said. It did. And Crimea was handed over ""like a sack of potatoes,"" Ukraine's Kyiv Post said. Now the people have spoken, and they want to be a part of Russia, Putin said, referring to a hastily-called weekend referendum on separating from Ukraine. ""In our hearts, we know Crimea has always been an inalienable part of Russia,"" he said. COUNTERPOINT . No, it doesn't . Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk called the annexation ""a robbery on an international scale,"" one that his nation will never accept. President Barack Obama and other European allies have accused Moscow of violating Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. Crimea, which has an ethnic Russian majority, has long been a semiautonomous region within Ukraine. It had its own Parliament, but Ukraine had veto power over its actions. ""One country has come and temporarily stolen part of the territory of an independent country,"" Yatsenyuk said. --- . POINT . Russia had no choice but to act . Ukraine's new government, backed by the United States and European powers, prepared ""to seize the state through terror and murders,"" Putin said. What was Russia to do? he asked. ""The main executors of this were nationalists, Russia-phobes and anti-Semites,"" he said. ""Those people define what is happening today in Ukraine."" COUNTERPOINT . Russia saw a chance and pounced . International observers said Moscow saw its chance to annex a strategic territory and took it. The region is pretty significant: It still hosts the home port of Russia's Black Sea fleet. Putin is ""mimicking the fascists of the last century"" by annexing Crimea, Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said. And he has goals, some analysts say. ""His project for his third term as President is to gather in as many of his neighbors as he can to form a new Eurasian Union,"" said Angela Stent, a professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. ""Ukraine is the key to that project. And Crimea is the key to Ukraine."" --- . POINT . The annexation's legal . The Russian leader accused the West of ""double standards"" in its response to the Crimean crisis, citing Kosovo's split from Serbia. In 1999, NATO conducted a two-month bombing campaign to separate Kosovo's Albanian population from the rest of Serbia. The United States supported the breakaway. ""It's absolutely in favor of their own interests -- black today, white tomorrow,"" Putin said. He said anyone who would allow Kosovo to split from Serbia and not Crimea from Ukraine would be showing ""absolute cynicism."" COUNTERPOINT . The annexation's illegal . The United States said Russia's justifications for taking Crimea amount to an attack on Ukraine's sovereignty. ""President Putin today gave a speech rewriting history, and it only further put him on the wrong side of history,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. Preceding the 1999 NATO campaign, ethnic Albanians were being slaughtered. Crimea's ethnic Russians were not facing the same prospect. ---- . POINT . The rest of Ukraine's safe . Even though there are Russian troops and vehicles along the border, Putin says there are no plans to take any more territories from Ukraine. COUNTERPOINT . The rest of Ukraine's under threat . Ukraine stands at ""the beginning of a very dangerous conflict, and we should do our best to stop this process,"" said Petro Poroshenko, a former foreign minister and a leading potential candidate for President. ""Several weeks ago, we had a guarantee that nothing (would) happen with the Crimea,"" he told CNN's Christian Amanpour. ""Now under attack can be any country in the European Union, including other parts of Ukraine."" --- . POINT . Russia will pay . U.S., Australian and EU officials imposed sanctions on more than two dozen Russian and Crimean officials. They include visa bans and frozen assets. ""President Putin should be in no doubt that Russia will face more serious consequences, and I will push European leaders to agree further EU measures when we meet on Thursday,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Russia faces more than just sanctions. ""We're talking about Russia putting itself on a path that undermines long-term confidence and creates obstacles for its full participation in the global economy,"" he said. ""That path that they've placed themselves on does nothing to help the next generation of Russians compete and succeed in a world that will be led by the most dynamic and open economies."" But Stent said maintaining warm ties with the United States is not a priority for Putin. Russia's granting of NSA leaker Edward Snowden asylum clearly shows that. ""Guaranteeing and expanding the Russian presence in Crimea is much more important,"" she said. COUNTERPOINT . Sanctions won't hurt . Russia's taking the threats lightly. Vladislav Surkov, a Putin aide named in the sanctions, called it ""a great honor"" to be singled out for American punishment. ""We wait for sanctions,"" deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin posted on Twitter. The message included a smiley face and a picture of a black bear, vodka and a rifle. Biographer Alexander Korobko said a country that can produce almost anything has no fear for sanctions. ""It is absolutely not in the U.S. interest to impose sanctions on Russia, because who will take American astronauts to space if not us Russians?"" Korobko asked. And the sanctions are a good indicator of how far this battle will go -- or rather not go. ""The so-called smart sanctions ... in response to events in Crimea were an anti-climax and a confirmation of a total lack of any desire on the part of the West to take the fight with Russia any further,"" said Alexander Nekrassov, a former Kremlin adviser. ---- . POINT . This means war . After a member of its military was killed and more captured when masked gunmen seized their base near the Crimean regional capital, Simferopol, Ukraine's defense ministry authorized its forces to open fire. It warned that the crisis was shifting from political to military, and blamed it on Russia. COUNTERPOINT . No one wants war . ""If there were an armed conflict, neither the United States nor NATO would get militarily involved,"" Stent said. ""And the result could be the dismemberment of Ukraine and its division into two states on either side of a new East-West divide."" Instead, the West should offer Ukraine's interim government financial support and encourage it ""not to let itself be provoked into a war with Russia as Georgia was in 2008."" --- . POINT . This will isolate Russia . It's not yet evident whether the sanctions will turn Russia into a pariah nation, but the U.S. has issued warnings to Moscow. ""Russia military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russia economy,"" President Barack Obama said. COUNTERPOINT . Putin's popularity soars . Though condemned by the West, the Russian leader was at the height of his popularity hours after the annexation. Crowds gathered at the capital to sing and dance. ""Vladimir, Vladimir, we love you!"" one woman said. ""We bow to you."" To some Russians, it symbolized a defeat against the West.","Russian President Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region .
Admonition, sanctions pour in from the West ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton is talking tough about Russia these days, for reasons both pragmatic and political. The overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, if she decides to run, Clinton already faces GOP criticism for allegedly being soft on Moscow as President Barack Obama's secretary of state until last year. A recent Republican National Committee statement mocked the ""reset"" button she offered to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2009 in what was a symbolic effort by the Obama administration to move past Russia's military backing for two breakaway regions in Georgia. Now Russia's attempted annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from neighboring Ukraine, another former Soviet territory, has again put Washington-Moscow relations in the spotlight. Using generally stronger and more provocative language than the administration she once represented, Clinton seeks to buff her own foreign policy credentials and those of her party without straying too far from the official government messaging and tactics. ""She has to walk a very fine line"" ""She has to walk a very fine line,"" Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller said of the former first lady and U.S. senator. The goal is to maintain her credibility as a former secretary of state, and the Democratic Party's credibility on security and defense issues, as the nation heads toward congressional elections in November and the presidential vote two years later, Schiller told CNN. ""She sees it as important not just for her but for the Democratic Party as a whole,"" Schiller said. Otherwise, ""you go from the party that killed Osama bin Laden to the party that can't stop Vladimir Putin."" Hillary Clinton: It's up to Putin whether there's 'another Cold War' On Tuesday, Clinton used a speech in Montreal to describe the conflict between Russia and Western allies over Crimea as a ""clash of values,"" adding that Putin would determine if another Cold War ensued. ""I hope there is not another Cold War,"" Clinton said in response to a question. ""Obviously, nobody wants to see that. I think that is primarily up to Putin."" She also called the Crimea situation an effort by Putin to ""rewrite the boundaries of post-World War II Europe."" ""If he is allowed to get away with that, I think you will see a lot of other countries either directly facing Russian aggression or suborned with their political system so that they are so intimidated that in effect they are transformed into vassals, not sovereign democracies,"" Clinton warned. ""There is a lot at stake here."" Much at stake . She called on the Obama administration to ""do a better job of supporting"" the interim Ukraine government, and pushed for easing Europe's energy dependence on Russia, saying: ""The Russians can only intimidate you if you are dependent on them."" Earlier this month, Clinton compared Putin's actions in Crimea to the tactics of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, when Germany began taking over neighboring countries. That remark drew media attention and some criticism, with Clinton clarifying her point the next day. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry also have criticized Putin, using careful language to insist that Russia's moves in Crimea violated international law and would never gain international acceptance. Romney slams Obama, Clinton for foreign policy 'failure' Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has played the role of administration attack dog by traveling to Poland, Lithuania and Estonia this week to label the Russian move in Crimea a ""land grab"" and pledge NATO support for former Soviet satellites now part of the alliance. Biden has hinted he might run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, and Schiller said Clinton's public posture on the Ukraine crisis takes a possible Biden challenge into consideration. Biden on her mind . ""On the off chance Joe Biden decides he wants to run, she's taking every opportunity to one-up him on foreign policy credentials,"" Schiller said. At the same time, Clinton wants to avoid launching any kind of ""real challenge"" to Obama on the issue, she added, saying ""you look like a turncoat and it reduces your credibility."" At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney rejected any political calculations in the U.S. response to Putin and Russia when asked about Republican claims the issue could hurt Clinton in 2016. ""That's a superficial way of looking at things,"" Carney said, adding that ""our obligation is to be very clear-eyed about what our national security interests are, what our obligations are to our allies and partners, and to pursue those."" Noting a ""temptation to see everything through the lens of the next election cycle,"" Carney said ""that's pretty flaccid thinking."" Hillary Clinton must once again win over some in Jewish community . CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.","Hillary Clinton talks tough about Russia's moves to annex Crimea from Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- Maj. Kurt Chew-Een Lee, the first Asian-American U.S. Marine Corps officer, rose through the ranks beginning his career from World War II to the Vietnam War. During the Korean War, he became commander of a machine gun platoon, to the shock of his men who had never before seen a person of Chinese ancestry. Some even questioned his loyalty as U.S. forces were battling Chinese forces, which had joined the conflict on the side of North Koreans. In a November 1950 clash, Lee and his men were outnumbered in a surprise attack by Chinese forces. His actions there and in another clash would earn him a bevy of military honors, including the second highest military decoration, the Navy Cross. Lee, at age 88, died in Washington, D.C., believed from what appears to be a heart attack Monday, according to close friend, Jamie Stevenson. Long after his retirement from military service, Lee was always fit and a natty-dresser like a true Marine, Stevenson said. Well into his 80s, he still fit into his uniform from 1953, she said. Lee was born in Sacramento, California, a son of Chinese immigrants. Eager to fight in World War II, Lee joined the U.S. Marines in 1944. ""People said that's the worst branch of the service. They're the first in, last one out. He was like, 'That's where I want to be.'"" Stevenson recalled Lee telling her. Instead, he was based at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego as a language instructor. When the Korean War started in 1950, Lee got his chance at the battlefield. He had arrived in Inchon, Korea that September along with UN troops, in an effort to retake the Korean peninsula from Communist forces. By November 1950, the Chinese army entered the war on the side of the Communists in North Korea. Inside his unit, Lee faced racial slurs like ""Chinese laundry"" or ""The Chinaman."" But the source of his discrimination proved to be crucial in saving the lives of his fellow Marines. Lee's unit came under sudden attack on November 2, 1950, his company had their first encounter with the Chinese forces. Heavily outnumbered by the Chinese forces and their firepower, Lee's unit was stuck until the gunfire stopped. ""It was eerie,"" said Lee, describing the battle scene to a Smithsonian Channel's documentary ""Uncommon Courage: Breakout at Chosin."" ""The Marines didn't know where the enemy was."" Lee struck out solo, trying to provoke enemy fire so his men could determine where the Chinese forces were hiding. He went out alone firing sporadic shots to make it seem like the Marines were advancing. The Chinese began returning fire, exposing their position. When Lee reached the outpost where the Chinese forces were hiding, he employed a ruse no one in his unit could've done. ""Don't shoot!"" he yelled. ""I'm Chinese."" Hearing Chinese confused them and the temporary distraction proved crucial as the Marines launched a counterattack. Looking back on his war experience, Lee told the Washington Post in 2010, ""Certainly, I was never afraid. Perhaps the Chinese are all fatalists. I never expected to survive the war. So I was adamant that my death be honorable, be spectacular."" He earned a Navy Cross for his actions. ""I have told (Lee) many times, thank God we had him,"" said Ronald Burbridge who served as a rifleman in Lee's unit in the Smithsonian documentary. Although injured, Lee returned to the battlefield. He led a mission to rescue a company of Marines overwhelmed by Chinese forces. On December 1, Lee guided his Marines in the frigid cold and through rocky hills to rescue them in the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. He was awarded the Silver Star for his action. His citation read that ""he contributed materially to the success of the epic night march of his battalion which resulted in the relief of the isolated Marine unit and the securing of vital ground."" ""His exploits in Korea were numerous. He was very successful in holding open a pass to allow our people to escape from the Chosin Reservoir, which is probably one of the greatest feats of military maneuvering in Korea,"" said his friend, Jim Kunkle, 91, who served in World War II. But he was not a boastful man, friends say. When asked what he was most proud of, Lee didn't talk about breaking down racial barriers or his experience in the Korean War, said Stevenson. ""What he'd say is, 'I am most proud of being able to train future generations of Marines.'"" Stevenson said. Lee went on to serve in the Vietnam War and received a Purple Heart with gold star. Lee had a sense of humor and always shared his opinion, Stevenson said. Living in Washington, D.C., he and Stevenson would drive around to various grocery stores searching for his favorite Chinese mooncakes with lotus seed and double yolk -- which he savored.

"(OPRAH.com) -- Physical attraction may be as old as time, but new studies are beginning to uncover the science behind sex appeal. Unexpected factors -- like biochemical odors, face shape and voice pitch -- just might have more to do with your choice of mate than anyone ever expected. Biostatistics expert Kendra Schmid explains why actress Halle Berry scored very high on facial attractiveness. Karl Grammer and Elizabeth Oberzaucher are leading the research on the human scent's influence on sexual attraction. They've found that when women are ovulating, they produce copulins, a scent that attracts men. The researchers believe when a man gets a whiff of copulins, his testosterone levels rise. As a result, he secretes androstenone, an odor that repels women who aren't ovulating. ""Bars and nightclubs across the world are the battlefield for this invisible biochemical war,"" Oprah Winfrey says. Sex therapist Dr. Laura Berman says attraction has a lot more to do with science and evolution than people might think. ""We are innately all puppies in heat,"" she says. ""We are capable of discerning 10,000 different scents consciously. But then there's a whole realm of unconscious scents that we're not even aware that we're smelling."" Oprah.com: Get Dr. Berman's 5 steps to better sex . These odors let people know when a woman is fertile and when a man's testosterone levels are high, Berman says. As a result, individuals can tell when someone else is most ripe for reproduction. ""It's all about survival of the species,"" she says. One common complaint Berman hears among women with relationship problems is that they love their partner, but they're not in love with him. ""There is a difference between love and chemistry,"" Berman says. ""Take a really good whiff of him without cologne when he's relatively clean. If that smell turns you on, that's a really good cue of chemistry."" Oprah.com: Can the chemistry come later? In one recent study, Berman says, researchers had women smell men's T-shirts. The women were most attracted to the shirts of men with a different major histocompatability complex (MHC) from them. MHC is a collection of genes that are related to immune systems. ""We unconsciously want to mate with someone who has a different immune system than ours because that helps with the survival of our offspring,"" Berman says. The T-shirt study also found that women taking hormonal contraception were attracted to men who had similar MHC as they did. ""If you're on the pill, your body is being tricked into think you're pregnant, so you're not ovulating,"" Berman says. ""The bad news there is that they have looked at these couples who have similar MHC, and not only do they have higher levels of infidelity and higher levels of marital discord, but they also have higher infertility issues."" Another unexpected factor that has been found to directly affect attraction is voice pitch. Gordon Gallup, Ph.D., a professor at the State University of New York at Albany, says that women with higher estrogen levels have higher voices, which makes them more desirable to men. ""When females are midcycle, when they're the most fertile, the most likely to conceive, their voices are rated as being significantly more attractive,"" he says. It's hard to pinpoint what distinguishes a gorgeous face from an average one, but some researchers are getting pretty close. Psychologist Lisa DeBruine, Ph.D., of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland says she's found that women's faces get more attractive to men when they are ovulating. ""We're not entirely clear why there's this difference, but we think that the women might look healthier, have a bit of a healthier glow when they are ovulating."" Symmetry is another factor that determines a face's attractiveness. Kendra Schmid, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, says there is a formula for the ""perfect"" face. She uses 29 different measurements to determine someone's appeal on a scale of 1 to 10. To start, Schmid says the ratio of the length of the face to the width of the face should be 1.6, also known as the golden ratio.""The face should also be divided into three equal pieces vertically,"" she says. ""The forehead, then [the bottom of the forehead to] the nose and then from the nose to the chin."" Who's face is the most ""perfect,"" according to Schmid's measurements? No big surprise here! ""Brad Pitt's is the highest that I've ever used the [formula] on,"" she says. ""He was a 9.3 [out of 10]."" Brad's partner, Angelina Jolie, didn't fare too badly either. ""Angelina was a 7.67, and that's pretty high,"" Schmid says. ""Most people rate about 4 to 6. ... The thing that is probably lowering her score is the thing that she's most famous for -- her full lips."" Schmid says that ideally the width of a mouth should be twice the height of the lips. Other celebrities Schmid tested were Halle Berry, who scored a 7.36, and Hugh Jackman, a 6.45. ""There's never been anyone who was a perfect 10,"" Schmid says. ""If you're out there, we're looking for you!"" Not everything that goes into finding a partner is biological. Researchers have also found that if a woman looks at the face of a man whom she knows nothing about, she will give it a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 that's different than if she is shown the same face and a corresponding income. When a man makes a lot of money, a woman will rate him higher on an attractiveness scale than she would that same man with a smaller income. Oprah.com: What do women really want? Berman says this isn't a case of women being gold diggers. ""It goes back again to evolution. When we were having babies who were very dependent on us, we couldn't hunt and take care of ourselves, so we were looking for the man who had the most social status, who was the best hunter, who was going to bring home the biggest chunk of meat for our babies,"" she says. ""It's the same thing today."" Smell, voice pitch and face symmetry might be unconscious detectors of attractiveness, but if you're trying to consciously assess the future of a relationship, Berman says there's one surefire way. ""You really learn a lot from a kiss. ... Sixty-six percent of women say they would dump a guy after a bad first kiss,"" she says. ""It's not only because you're getting that good whiff of him so you're seeing if you like the way he smells. All your senses are engaged, and you get a sense of his sensuality, his connection, whether he's a take-charge kind of guy or more of a stepping back kind."" When it comes to relationships, Berman says kissing frequency is a direct indicator of happiness. ""It turns out that couples who kiss and cuddle regularly are eight times less likely to be stressed and depressed than couples who don't get that,"" she says. ""You have to have a minimum of a 10-second kiss every day."" From The Oprah Winfrey Show . Subscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price.

"Simferopol, Crimea (CNN) -- A deadline Ukraine's acting President gave Crimea's separatist leaders to release hostages came and went without apparent incident Wednesday, after pro-Russian activists stormed the former Soviet state's navy headquarters in the region. Amid signs the uneasy standoff between pro-Russian and Ukrainian forces could ignite into bloody conflict -- a day after Moscow claimed Crimea as its own -- almost 300 armed pro-Russian supporters took over the naval base in Sevastopol, said Marina Kanalyuk, assistant to the commander of Ukraine's navy fleet. ""They are everywhere here, they surround us, they threaten us,"" she said, adding that she was sure that Russian security forces were involved. Kanalyuk said the 70 or so Ukrainian naval officers at the headquarters had tried to stop the armed men from entering and were negotiating with them. She said that the armed men had replaced Ukrainian flags with Russian standards but that no shots had been fired. Ukrainian navy chief Sergey Gaiduk was taken away. Russia's official ITAR-Tass news agency, citing the local Kryminform news agency, reported Gaiduk had been passed to the Sevastopol prosecutor's office to be questioned about whether he'd passed on orders from Kiev for Ukrainian soldiers to use their weapons. Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov issued a 9 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) deadline for Crimea to release all hostages and stop all provocations, a statement on the presidential website said. That deadline passed with no apparent consequences. It had warned that if all hostages, including Gaiduk, were not released by then, authorities would take action of ""technical and technological character,"" likely meaning turning off utilities. Meanwhile in Kiev, officials unveiled a series of new measures against Russia and the ""self-proclaimed"" authorities in Crimea. In a televised briefing, Andriy Porubiy, secretary of the national defense and security council, said the measures included a full-scale visa system for Russians and that if the United Nations designates Crimea a ""demilitarized zone,"" Ukraine was prepared to evacuate its military personnel and family members. Ukraine has facilities ready to accommodate 25,000 evacuees. The country has decided to leave the Commonwealth of Independent States, an organization made up of republics of the former Soviet Union, Porubiy said. Kiev also will estimate the damages caused by the annexation. NATO: 'Business as usual is not an option' The incident at the navy headquarters comes a day after one member of the Ukrainian military was killed, another wounded and more captured when masked gunmen seized their base near the Crimean regional capital, Simferopol. After that fatality -- the first Ukrainian military death since the Crimean crisis erupted about two weeks ago -- Ukraine's Defense Ministry authorized its forces to open fire in self-defense. On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Crimea, after voters in the semi-autonomous territory approved a hastily called weekend referendum on separating from Ukraine. Speaking in Washington, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned of the organization's fear that Russia may move into eastern Ukraine. ""I see Crimea as an element in, in a greater pattern, in a more long-term Russian, or at least Putin, strategy. So, of course, our major concern now is whether he will go beyond Crimea, whether Russia will intervene in the eastern parts (of Ukraine),"" he said. ""No one wants to turn away from our cooperation with Russia, but no one can ignore that Russia has violated the very principles upon which that cooperation is built. So business as usual is not an option,"" Rasmussen said. Elsewhere, the head of Ukraine's state TV reportedly was assaulted by at least three lawmakers from Ukraine's far-right Svoboda party and forced to resign. In a video posted online, the MPs could be seen arguing with to Oleksandr Panteleymonov, asking him why the station aired a concert from Moscow live. He was then roughed up. Speaking to CNN by phone from hospital where he said he was being checked for injuries, Panteleymonov called the incident a ""quarrel"" and confirmed he had to sign a paper. The U.S. embassy in Kiev condemned the incident. U.N. chief to visit Russia, Ukraine . As diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continue, the United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon would visit Russia and Ukraine this week ""as part of his diplomatic efforts to encourage all parties to resolve the current crisis peacefully."" He will meet Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Thursday and Turchynov and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Friday in Kiev. Speaking at the United Nations on Wednesday, Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev called upon ""the entire civilized world not to recognize the illegitimately declared independence of Crimea and its violent dismembering from the territory of our country."" He expressed reservations about the referendum, saying that Russian citizens were able to vote and journalists were banned. ""The declaration of independence by the Crimean Republic is a direct consequence of the application of the use of force and threats against Ukraine by the Russian Federation,"" Sergeyev said. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power echoed his comments, stressing that what happened in Crimea cannot be recognized as valid, nor can it be repeated in other parts of Ukraine. ""A thief can steal property, but that does not confer the right of ownership on the thief,"" she said. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, dispatched to reassure NATO allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, met Wednesday with the presidents of Lithuania and Latvia in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius. He stressed the United States was committed to the defense of its NATO allies and had stern words for Moscow's response to the political upheaval in Ukraine. ""Russia has chosen to respond with military aggression, a referendum rejected by virtually the entire world, illegal efforts to annex Crimea and now reports of armed attacks against Ukrainian military personnel and installations in Crimea,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear: We stand resolutely with our Baltic allies in support of the Ukrainian people and against Russian aggression."" U.S. officials are keeping a close eye on the growing number of heavily equipped Russian forces near the Ukraine border because of concern the troops could move into Ukraine with little or no warning. One U.S. official with access to the latest intelligence said the estimate is that in recent days, Russia has assembled up to 20,000 forces in ""motorized"" units. They are so close to the border that the United States would not have enough time to predict what they might do, but would only see it as it was happening, the official said. One theory the U.S. is considering is that the Russians may plan to establish a ""land bridge"" into Crimea, the official said. He described it as moving forces to an area they can control, so they have assured access in the future. Also Wednesday, Ukraine's deputy premier, Vitaly Yarema, and acting Defense Minister Ihor Tenuyh took off from Kiev, planning to fly to Crimea to ""resolve all problematic issues,"" but Crimean authorities would not allow them to land, the statement on the Ukrainian presidential website said. Escalation fear . Yatsenyuk warned Tuesday the crisis was shifting ""from political to the military form, and the blame is on the Russian military."" The weekend's contested referendum has been condemned by the interim Kiev government, the United States and the European Union. But Russia remains steadfastly defiant. For Ukrainians, 'it's hard to not be concerned' Russia's Constitutional Court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the agreement between the Russian Federation and Crimea on its accession to Russia was lawful, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. The step clears the way for the country's lawmakers to vote on ratifying the accession agreement, as well as draft amendments to the Russian Constitution, it said. The State Duma, or lower house, will hold a special session Thursday to ratify the treaty, ITAR-Tass reported. Putin made it clear Tuesday, in a speech greeted by enthusiastic applause by Russian lawmakers, that Moscow has no intention of relinquishing its grip on Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula with historical ties to Russia. ""In our hearts, we know Crimea has always been an inalienable part of Russia,"" he said. Of those who cast a ballot, 96.7% voted in favor of Crimea leaving Ukraine and joining Russia, according to the Crimean Electoral Commission. But the ballot questions offered no real option for any residents who wanted to remain part of Ukraine. Putin said Russia had to act because Ukraine's new government, backed by Washington and European powers, was prepared ""to seize the state through terror and murders."" But Yatsenyuk called it ""a robbery on an international scale,"" one that Kiev will never accept. Members of the Russian parliament and the new Crimean legislature met Wednesday morning in Moscow to discuss the details of how the region will join Russia. Russia's annexation of Crimea opportune or opportunistic? Rising tensions . Crimean lawmakers have said they now see Ukrainian soldiers as an occupying force and have given them a certain amount of time to leave the peninsula. The Ukrainian troops have been encircled by pro-Russian forces in their bases for days. They have also come under pressure from pro-Russian crowds who gather outside and call on those still loyal to Kiev to surrender or defect to Russia's military. CNN teams on the ground have seen Russian forces also show up to reinforce that message. Putin has denied Russia's military has been used in Crimea, despite what has been stated by international observers and the government of Kiev. The pro-Russian forces seen in Crimea are Crimean ""self-defense"" forces, he said. Putin said the 22,000 Russian troops in Crimea did not enter during the current crisis, but ""were already there,"" in accordance with previous international negotiations. Russian forces were allowed in Crimea under a treaty that allowed the Black Sea fleet to be based in the port of Sevastopol, but their movements within Crimea are supposed to be agreed upon with Kiev. U.S. and EU officials have imposed sanctions on more than two dozen Russian and Crimean officials and urged Russia to avoid escalating the crisis, but Moscow has ignored those calls. Putin may be under international pressure over Russia's actions in Crimea, but public opinion is firmly behind him at home. Cheering crowds celebrated the announcement that Crimea was now part of Russia at some 80 rallies across the country, from Vladivostok to Moscow's Red Square.

"(CNN) -- Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are looking for a man who assaulted five other young British girls on vacation in Portugal, London's Metropolitan Police said Wednesday. Madeleine was 3 when she disappeared while she was on vacation in the Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz with her family in June 2007. Her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide. Officers are investigating 12 potentially linked crimes at resorts near where the toddler vanished. The man, whom witnesses describe as being tanned with short, dark, unkempt hair, is suspected of breaking in to 12 vacation homes where British families were staying in the Algarve between 2004 and 2010. In four of the incidents, girls between 7 and 10 years of age were sexually assaulted in their beds. On one of these occasions, he assaulted two girls in the same villa, police said. These attacks happened between 2004 and 2006. ""Whilst not identical, there are many similar aspects to each of the incidents in that in most cases there were no signs of forced entry to the property, nothing was taken, and the intruder appeared in the early hours of the morning,"" between 2 and 5 a.m., police said in a statement . ""The suspect may have been in the villa or looking round the villa for some time before committing the offenses or being disturbed either by a parent coming in, or the child waking up. He remained calm, even when disturbed."" Mystery . Of the 12 offenses, there were four in Carvoeiro, six in the Vale da Parra, Praia da Gale district, and two in Praia da Luz. On two occasions, the noise of a bin collection lorry could be heard nearby. The man is said to have spoken in English with a foreign accent, and his voice was described as slow, or possibly slurred. ""These matters are very serious. It's very important primarily for us to understand and identify who this offender is,"" Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said. ""Firstly, because clearly nobody has been prosecuted for these horrible offenses against these young people. And secondly, once we have identified this offender, we need to be able to prove or disprove whether these offenses and that offender is connected to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann."" Last October, new police sketches were released of potential suspects in the case, and UK police appeared in a television appeal for information. The program prompted a flurry of tips, and police in Portugal announced they would reopen the case. Since then, the Portuguese investigation has run in parallel with the British one. Detectives have previously said they were investigating a spike in break-ins in the area in the weeks before Madeleine disappeared, two of them in the same block where her family was staying. Mystery has surrounded Madeleine's disappearance for the past six years. Neither her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, nor the detectives investigating her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from Leicestershire, England. CNN's Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Officers probing 12 potentially linked crimes at resorts near where Madeleine vanished .

"(CNN) -- Aurora Ogg wakes up every day and goes to work with one mission: connecting people in her community with the Republican Party, so that in November they can be proud to cast a ballot for our candidates. Aurora is the Asian Coalition regional director in Colorado. She's been on the ground since September of last year, earlier than field staffers like her are usually hired. And she wasn't alone. Following the release of the Growth and Opportunity Project report -- a comprehensive post-2012 election review I commissioned -- the Republican National Committee committed to building a permanent, year-round ground game. We immediately began locating and hiring field staff all across the country. Aurora has the full support of the RNC and our resources. Thanks to our multimillion-dollar investment in technology, and the private sector talent we've brought on board, she has at her fingertips a suite of tools that allow her to identify voters we need to target in her community. The data she's plugged into is the best in politics. We've collected data from commercial and political organizations to make sure that we have the most current information needed to contact voters effectively. We've invested in new predictive analytics that are revolutionizing how our campaigns understand what matters to each individual voter. Not only are we making the data better, we are improving how other Republicans can access our data and provide data back to us. Our new voter relationship management tool, GOP Beacon, makes it easier for people to download and see the data. Our new connecting tool, or application programming interface, allows other committees, candidates and vendors to receive our data automatically and send data back to us in real time. To ensure we recruit the best talent to develop the best tools, we launched a startup-style initiative within the RNC called Para Bellum Labs, and we opened a field office in Silicon Valley. In addition to all these data resources, field staffers like Aurora are given a communications playbook with media lists, information on important surrogates, suggested events to attend and messaging on key issues, as well as access to media training, research and social media help. This isn't just one person's story. It's the story of our field staffers across the country -- state directors, data directors, and Hispanic, black, and Asian-American engagement staffers. The RNC has also hired staff dedicated to engaging better with women, youth, people of faith and conservative allies and groups. We have hundreds of staff fanned out, especially in critical midterm states, supporting our candidates and growing our party. Today, 91% of our political staff is in the field. They support whole teams of precinct captains. We've recruited more than 12,000 captains nationwide. Those captains have teams of volunteers whose job it is to maintain lasting relationships with sets of people in their communities. They're listening to their concerns and making sure they hear about the issues they care about. This is all done alongside our state parties and sister committees. That's why we've invested millions in our state parties to date. In addition to our on-the-ground work, we're looking ahead and changing the 2016 presidential primary process so that we have better debates, handpicked moderators and an earlier convention. We have two overarching goals: holding a primary that is more informative and engaging for voters, and having a nominee who enters the general election in a position of strength. It's been one year since I announced the first actions we'd take in response to the Growth and Opportunity Project. Today, I can report that we've fundamentally reshaped the way we do business. The power of our new tools and new strategy was on display last week, when we helped David Jolly win an important special election in Florida's 13th Congressional District. That victory has Democrats worried about November. Of course, this is just a snapshot. And it's also just the beginning. There's much more ahead, including an ad campaign we're launching this week -- a six-figure ad buy in 14 Senate target states. This campaign is about answering the question, ""Why should I be a Republican?"" People have told us that we need to better communicate what it is Republicans stand for. But instead of the RNC telling people, we asked Republicans to tell the RNC -- and the rest of the country -- what they stand for. Why are they Republicans? And that's what you'll see in these ads. We hope this campaign will help us have that important and ongoing conversation. As for me, I'm a Republican because I believe all Americans, regardless of where they come from, regardless of where they're going, should have the chance to create their own American Dreams. That's a message we're taking to every American, to every community. And thanks to the actions we've taken in the last year, we're better equipped than ever before to do that. We're going to keep working to earn every voter's trust, and we're going keep fighting to earn every American's vote. We're guided by the principle that no voter should be taken for granted; no voter should be overlooked.

"(CNN) -- Until authorities know what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, they'll look for clues in the histories of everyone on board. The cruel reality is that every one of the 239 people on board is both a possible victim and a possible suspect -- until proved otherwise. Already, some passengers and the pilots have fallen under increased scrutiny, and more are likely to come into focus as the search for answers continues. ""You have to look at everybody that got onto that plane,"" Bill Gavin, former assistant director of the FBI in New York, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Monday. ""You can start peeling the onion there by eliminating some of the people immediately -- you know, like children, and maybe very elderly people, or infirmed people. You might be able to eliminate those folks. ""But, by the same token, you really have to look through the whole category of people that are on the plane,"" he said. Here's what we have so far about some of the people investigators want to know more about: . Pilot: Zaharie Ahmad Shah . Malaysia's Prime Minister has said that somebody deliberately steered the plane off course. That means the pilots have become one obvious area of focus. On Saturday, Malaysian police searched Zaharie Ahmad Shah's home. The 53-year-old pilot and father of three lives in an upscale, gated community in Shah Alam, outside Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian police said Sunday they were still investigating a flight simulator seized from that house. It's somewhat common among aviation enthusiasts to use online flight simulator programs to replicate various situations. An initial search of the personal computers and e-mails of the pilots found nothing to indicate that a sudden deviation in the Boeing 777's route was preplanned, U.S. officials said on Tuesday, after being briefed by Malaysian authorities. U.S. officials reviewed cockpit conversations between the flight and air traffic controllers and again said they saw nothing suspicious or anything that would explain why the jetliner deviated from its course. The pilot's political beliefs are also being questioned. Zaharie is a public supporter of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. Just hours before the flight took off, a court ordered Anwar to prison on charges of sodomy, a sentence the opposition leader says is a political vendetta. Despite the timing of the decision, there is no evidence to tie the plane's disappearance to the pilot or his politics. ""He likely was upset at the verdict that had just been announced several hours before he boarded the aircraft, but to down an airline because of that I think at this point is pure conjecture. Again, I would take any of these accusations with a huge grain of salt,"" the RAND Corporation's Seth Jones told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Peter Chong, a friend of Zaharie's, similarly said it's unfair to imply the pilot had anything to do with what happened to the plane. He said he'd been to Zaharie's house and tried out the flight simulator. ""It's a reflection of his love for people,"" Chong said, ""because he wants to share the joy of flying with his friends."" Zaharie joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and has more than 18,000 flying hours. Who were the pilots? Co-pilot: Fariq Ab Hamid . Fariq Ab Hamid, 27, started at the airline in 2007 and has 2,763 flying hours. Two vans were loaded with small bags, similar to shopping bags, at the home of the co-pilot, according to a CNN crew that observed activities at the residence. It was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home, and police made no comment about their activities there. U.S. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that ""those in the cockpit"" -- the captain and co-pilot -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking has told CNN. The official emphasized that no final conclusions have been drawn and that all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date. Acting Malaysian Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein has told reporters the pilots didn't request to work together. Passenger: Mohammed Khairul Amri Selamat . The 29-year-old Malaysian civil aviation engineer works for a private jet charter company. Although police are investigating all passengers and crew, he is likely to be of particular interest because of his aviation knowledge. ""I am confident that he is not involved,"" his father said Monday. ""They're welcome to investigate me and my family."" The bottom line, investigators say, is that whoever flew the plane off course for hours appeared to know what they were doing. They are looking into the backgrounds of the passengers to see whether any of them were trained pilots. ""There are still a few countries who have yet to respond to our request for a background check,"" said Khalid Abu Bakar, inspector general of the Royal Malaysian Police Force. ""But there are a few ... foreign intelligence agencies who have cleared all the(ir) passengers."" Passengers: Pouri Nourmohammadi and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza . In the first few days after the plane went missing, investigators focused intensely on two passengers who boarded the plane using stolen passports. Authorities have since identified them as Nourmohammadi, 18, and Reza, 29, both Iranians. The men entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports, according to Interpol. Malaysian police believe Nourmohammadi was trying to emigrate to Germany using a stolen Austrian passport. His mother contacted police after her son didn't arrive in Frankfurt as expected. Malaysian investigators say neither of the men has any apparent connection to terrorist organizations. Stolen passports don't necessarily indicate terrorism. In fact, passengers flew without having their travel documents checked against Interpol's lost-and-stolen passport database more than a billion times in 2013, according to the international police organization. Terrorist link? While investigators continue their search, one possibility that has been talked about is that an act of terrorism downed the airliner. There has been speculation that Uyghur Muslim separatists in China's far western Xinjiang province might have been involved in the plane's disappearance. The Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group who live in Xinjiang, an area the size of Iran that is rich in natural resources, including oil. One of the two long corridors where authorities say the plane was last detected stretched over Xinjiang, and unconfirmed reports have suggested the possibility that Uyghurs might be connected to the case. Chinese authorities have accused separatists from Xinjiang of carrying out a terrorist attack this month in which eight attackers armed with long knives stormed a train station in Kunming, a city in southwestern China, killing 29 people and wounding more than 140. However, on Tuesday, China said it found no evidence that any of its citizens on board the missing plane were involved in hijacking or terrorism. Background checks on all passengers from the Chinese mainland on the plane have found nothing to support such suspicions, said Huang Huikang, the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia, according to the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua. Authorities have said they are investigating all 239 people who were on board the flight. According to the airline, 153 of the 227 passengers came from mainland China or Hong Kong. By effectively ruling out suspicions for most of the passengers, Chinese authorities appear to have significantly shortened the list of possible suspects in the investigation.

"(CNN) -- For a Tyrannosaurus rex looking for a snack, nothing might have tasted quite like the ""chicken from hell."" That's one way Matt Lamanna describes Anzu wyliei, the species of dinosaur that he and fellow paleontologists unveiled Wednesday. It's not the only way, though. Feathered demon also works, which is why Anzu -- derived from Sumerian mythology -- was chosen as a name. Or you could characterize it, as Lamanna also told CNN, as a 600-pound cross between an ostrich and a velociraptor. And it's ""pretty damn close"" to looking like the 6-foot-tall turkey a child famously referred to in the movie ""Jurassic Park,"" except a lot stranger and meaner looking. ""You might think this was a really, really weird-looking bird,"" Lamanna said. ""... But, in fact, this was a very bird-like dinosaur ... with a really long bony tail, very large hands and really sharp claws."" Lamanna, from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, detailed the finding Wednesday with fellow scientists from the University of Utah, the Smithsonian Institution in the scientific journal PLOS One. This study came about not from one excavation but from three dating to Cretaceous period and from a rock formation known as Hell Creek in North and South Dakota. The ""chicken from hell"" moniker aside, what makes Anzu wylie especially exciting to paleontologists is that it's the largest species of egg-stealing oviraptors yet found in North America, said Emma Schachner, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Utah. It's also ""the first largely complete skeleton I think anyone has found of these guys,"" she said. Lamanna's predecessor at Carnegie -- Hans-Dieter Sues, now with the Smithsonian -- had acquired two fossils that were dug up in the late 1990s in South Dakota by commercial fossil hunters. Lamanna said that he and Sues decided to work together to figure out what they had. Their breakthrough came at a 2005 conference in Canada, where it became ""abundantly clear"" that a presentation from Schachner and colleague Tyler Lyson detailed the same species. Collectively, they pieced together 75% to 80% of the skeleton, which is a very large percentage in paleontology circles, according to Lamanna. Rather than race to publish their finding first, the four scientists teamed up and by doing so, ""learned more ... than we would all have learned independently,"" said Lamanna. What they learned was that the 11Â½-foot-long, roughly 10-foot-tall Anzu wyliei had a bird-like beak and apparent feathers, with a large crest atop its skull and less of a tail than a T. rex. It munched on vegetation, small animals and perhaps eggs. A replication of its skeleton is on display inside Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum. That's a very different environment from the lush, warm, humid, almost bayou-like conditions that it enjoyed roughly 66 million years ago in what's now a very different North and South Dakota. Not that it was an easy life. Schachner noted that one specimen appeared to have a broken rib, while another had a busted toe. And those injuries are nothing compared with Anzu wyliei's likely efforts dodging the so-called King of the Dinosaurs. ""It probably spent a lot of its life,"" Lamanna pointed out, ""on the lookout for T. rex."" Itsy bitsy dinosaur had a famously big cousin . Biggest predator ever to stalk Europe: 4-inch teeth and 33 feet long . Check out a mutant blend of a triceratops and a giant parrot .","Anzu wyliei lived near the end of the dinosaur era alongside T. rex .

"(CNN) -- They're familiar characters in the debate over controversial Halloween costumes: suicide bombers, geishas, gangsta rappers, rednecks and sexy nurses. Such costumes regularly draw allegations of racism, sexism or insensitivity. But where do fully-clothed folk legends fit in? American Apparel featured characters on both ends of the spectrum this month in its annual do-it-yourself Halloween costume guide. Below a collection of pin-up girl costumes -- including a model donning a breast-baring serape -- was ""La Llorona,"" the ghostly weeping woman who kidnaps wandering children, according to folklore in parts of Latin America. True, she was wearing a lace bustier under a shawl, but the layers upon layers make her appear more like the haunted bag lady than a sexy spirit. It's the folk legend's cultural significance -- and the lack of skin, save an inch of midriff -- that, for some, make this costume more acceptable than sexy señoritas or Mexican tequila guy. Halloween costumes inspired by Internet memes . ""One is mythology, and the other is a stereotype that comes with a lot of baggage,"" said feminist blogger Veronica Arreola, assistant director of the Center for Research on Women and Gender at University of Illinois at Chicago. It's like dressing up as the Greek goddess Athena and paying tribute to a specific character instead of impersonating a stereotype that doesn't represent the culture as a whole, she said. ""La Llorona is a folk tale, our bogeyman, our witch from our culture. That as a costume is better than the idea of someone dressing up in a sombrero or poncho and deciding 'I'm Mexican today!'"" Arreola said. ""We're a culture, not a costume"" returns . It's an argument similar to the one an Ohio University student group made last year in its ""We're a culture, not a costume"" campaign that spoke out against dressing up as racial and ethnic stereotypes. The campaign went viral, generating memes often more offensive than the original images and sparking debate over the line between distasteful and playful. The response prompted the group, Students Teaching About Racism in Society, to refresh its campaign this year. In response to criticism that the campaign did not incorporate a ""Caucasian stereotype,"" the group added a new image of an ""Appalachian costume"" representing ""hick"" stereotypes, said Ohio University senior and STARS President Keith Hawkins. ""[We] decided to continue with the posters because we agreed that they were not only successful last year but actually made a difference on campus and in the global community,"" he said. ""We were told by many professors that students wanted to talk about it, and this is exactly what we were looking to do. So we hoped we could put out another strong campaign this year that will continue the message of racial awareness and inclusively."" Hawkins says the line between playful and offensive falls at the point where the costume plays on negative and derogatory stereotypes of a marginalized culture. ""When the costume portrays a hero or legend in general, I would say it is not offensive,"" he said. ""It is the act of either using the hero or legend (or constructing a separate costume) that over-exaggerates negative stereotypes that often stigmatize marginalized cultures that makes the costume offensive."" Natural part of the ""assimilation process"" In other words, it's the way the character is depicted that makes the differences. Like the cartoonish skulls and decorations that traditionally adorn altars on Day of the Dead, the appropriation of La Llorona as a costume is a sign of mainstream America absorbing aspects of Latino culture, said Marisa Treviño, founder and publisher of Latina Lista. ""I think it's a natural progression of the whole assimilation process,"" Treviño said. However, that she appears in the American Apparel ad alongside women in hot pants, tube tops and garter belts shows that the tendency to exploit female sexuality for the sake of costumes still prevails, both women agreed. In some ways, sexism in Latin America's mass media bears some blame for perceptions of Latinas as buxom sex objects, Treviño said. ""Spanish-language media bring in programs from Central and South America on a daily basis that portrays Latinas in this very sexy, provocative way. For people channel-surfing who are not familiar with the Latino community, those images stay in their mind,"" she said. It's not just a concern for Latinos, Arreola said. It's something that all women should think about before they decide to dress as a sexy anything: geisha or farmer's daughter. ""There are costumes that take both of those problems and push them together and we need to deal with them,"" she said. ""It's getting outrageous."" How are you celebrating Halloween?

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Lawrence gives everything her all -- even lip-syncing. The Oscar winning actress gave a showstopping performance in 2013's ""American Hustle,"" but there's one scene that we're just now getting to fully appreciate. In the David O. Russell dramedy, Lawrence plays Rosalyn Rosenfeld, a '70s housewife with a penchant for belting out the era's hits while scrubbing down her home. In the movie, Lawrence sings along to Wings' ""Live and Let Die"" with such fervor it left us wishing she had a second career as a cover band frontwoman. But it gets even better: it turns out Lawrence also filmed a scene with Santana's 1969 track ""Evil Ways"" as the song of choice. The sequence didn't make it into the final film, but the DVD/Blu-ray, released on March 18, includes extended outtakes like this one: . Clearly, we've been approaching housecleaning in the wrong way. It seems it's best done with solo dancing and the most sincere lip-syncing this side of a pop star's concert. Lawrence may have lost out on a best supporting actress Oscar for her ""American Hustle"" role -- that went to Lupita Nyong'o for ""12 Years A Slave"" -- but she's won the Internet with this performance.","Jennifer Lawrence gives a powerful performance in ""American Hustle""

"(CNN) -- There are happy songs -- and then there is ""Happy."" The bouncy tune by singer/composer/producer/rapper Pharrell Williams has occupied the No. 1 spot on the charts for more than a month. It's spurred countless covers -- including one by Academy Award-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow, reprising her guest star role in the 100th episode of ""Glee."" There is even a YouTube version of ""Happy"" that has gone completely to the dogs. What is it about this song, which is so infectiously enjoyable that Meryl Streep had to shimmy to it when Williams performed at the Oscars? Is it the catchy melody? Is it the insistent nature of such lyrics as ""Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth""? Is it that extra bounce you feel when the back up singers airily croon ""Because I'm happppppyyyy""? Or is it the joy of watching Williams and several other folks dance, bounce and lip-sync along with the song in the music video? Yes. Simply put, the song is all those things, even as it has managed to seemingly capture the rush of happiness in its lyrics and melody. Not a bad trick for a tune that slowly grew from a single on last summer's ""Despicable Me 2"" soundtrack to such popularity that Robert Morast, a writer for the Virginian-Pilot, recently entered into a debate of whether it should be considered for the official state song of Virginia. ""Pharrell's hit track is a jolt of mood-lifting music,"" wrote Morast, who was more partial to the Carter Family's ""Can the Circle Be Unbroken."" ""And while it's fine to be happy, the best art is crafted with a range of emotional perspectives."" Even with its slow build, ""Happy"" caught ears from the beginning. Upon release it was quickly dubbed ""an instant contender for 2013's Song of the Summer"" by Rolling Stone. Since then, it's topped the charts in more than a dozen countries besides the United States, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Poland. Violinist Lindsey Stirling, who's worked with John Legend and mixes classically styled music with electronic dub-step beats, asks simply, how ""can you not love ('Happy')?"" ""I was with a friend, and when ('Happy') came on, her baby started kicking and trying to dance,"" Stirling said. ""We were laughing hysterically and saying 'Even babies love this song.' "" She said she believes the reason ""Happy"" is so beloved is because of its uplifting message. ""I get so excited when something this positive goes this big,"" said Stirling, whose album ""Shatter Me"" will be released at the end of April. ""It's spreading good feelings and isn't at all controversial. It's just something that is making people really happy."" Williams has partnered with the United Nations Foundation in celebration of Thursday's International Day of Happiness, encouraging fans to donate to the organization and submit content to his 24Hoursof Happiness.com site. Visitors were asked to tag their submissions, be they dancing, singing or just ""being happy"" with the #HappyDay. At noon Thursday, in each time zone around the world, Williams will highlight some of the best. ""Happy"" is also one of the lead singles on Williams new album ""Girl,"" which has already shot to No. 1 in almost 80 countries and on streaming music giant Spotify. The singer is overwhelmed by the goodwill. ""This is probably the most I've ever been humbled in my entire life,"" Williams told the Los Angeles Times about his song and the reaction to it. ""Because it's something bigger than me, bigger than anything I've ever done."" No doubt that makes him happy.","Fans across the world seem to be in love with the infectious ""Happy""

"(CNN) -- I am probably neither the first nor last critic to say this, but Michel Hazanavicius' ""The Artist"" is a flawless film. There is literally nothing wrong with it. I don't have a single nit to pick, minor flaw to point out or little bit that annoyed me. It is pure magic from the first frame to the last. It is proof that to be moving, engaging, enthralling and fun, movies have no need for sex or violence, color or even spoken dialog, for that matter. That's not to say I don't love many films with all those things, but ""The Artist"" has distilled cinema to something it so rarely achieves: pure joy in art. This is not art for art's sake, this is art for enjoyment's sake. It's not an ""important"" film that we all need to see because it's great art (although it is both important and art) it is a film that everyone should see because it's joyous. It's stunningly beautiful. It's a throwback to some of the things that brought people into the cinema in the first place. The chance to escape their lives and live someone else's for a time. The story is relatively simple and takes plot elements from ""Singing in the Rain,"" ""Citizen Kane"" and ""A Star is Born"" as well as the best of Hollywood melodrama. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a matinee idol, a star of the (silent) silver screen. Along with his faithful Jack Russell terrier (Uggie), Valentin stars in action adventures and is revered by men and women alike. It's the age old story: Men want to be him and women want to be with him. At the premiere of his latest blockbuster, as George is mugging for the cameras and signing autographs, he runs into Peppy Miller (a luminous Bérénice Bejo), an aspiring actor. They meet cute when she is caught in the throng of autograph seekers (she is one herself) and suddenly finds herself on the other side of the policemen holding back the crowd and standing right next to her idol. Taking advantage of the situation, Peppy begins to mug, planting one on her idol's cheek, landing the pair on the cover of Variety and setting the plot in motion, a variation on the old ""boy meets girl"" standard. While George is reveling in his box office glory and Peppy is hoping to make the most of her instant fame, George's wife, Doris (Penelope Ann Miller), is stewing in jealousy and resentment. And while the photo in Variety is completely innocent, one gets the feeling her fears may not be completely groundless. Peppy lands a gig as an extra in George's next film and the obvious attraction between the two begins to manifest itself. Peppy is a starstruck aspiring actress just beginning her career in show business and George is a veteran movie star and ladies man at the top of his game. You also get the feeling he's been in this situation before. Things are going well for George. Despite the unrest at home, he's got a new film, he's got a new crush and all is right in his world, until the head of the studio, Al Zimmer (John Goodman), begins to embrace the talkies. While Al is convinced that the advent of sound is the future of film, George is convinced the public will stick with him, so he bets on the continued popularity of the silent film. Thus, his career begins to wane, just as Peppy's beings to wax. The end of the silent era (and his marriage) and the crash of the stock market send George into a spiral of booze and self-loathing, with only his faithful dog and chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell) sticking by him. Bitter over the demise of his career, George even lashes out at what he sees as the symbol of that decline, Peppy. ""The Artist"" isn't actually a silent film per se, as it has a score and well, I won't spoil it for you, but Hazanavicius' use of sound is ingenious. However, for all intents and purposes, it is silent. For the actors, there was very little difference, as they still speak their lines, we just don't hear them, but for the audience, the change is immeasurable. Instead of watching their faces almost exclusively, we find our eyes drifting across the screen and noticing things that perhaps we might not have noticed otherwise. A subtle cue of body language, the placing of objects within the frame, how the music moves the action along, all of these and more come alive when we're not tied to watching the actors speak. Hazanavicius has a deft hand at directing and a delightful sense of whimsey. The film is peppered with sight gags in the best of classic Hollywood tradition, and both Dujardin and Bejo prove more than up for the task. A brief pantomime between Bejo and one of George's suit jackets is worth the price of admission alone -- and keep your eye on the dog! Hazanavicius and his backers took a huge risk in making the film. They funded a black and white, silent film with two unknown (in the United States) leads and a handful of supporting Hollywood talent. However, when Dujardin picked up the best actor prize at Cannes and reviews started to pour in, they knew they had a winner on their hands. A pure and open love letter to the cinema, ""The Artist"" contains many nods and winks to the history of this art form and clever viewers will pick up on a few cues. It is, as I have mentioned, a comedy, a melodrama and a romance, but above all, it fulfills the promise of what cinema can be at its best. It takes us on a journey up to the peaks and down in the valleys, through love, loss, heartbreak and despair and right back around again to love. ""The Artist"" is rated PG-13, although it's on the tame end of the scale. A bird is flipped, there are a few moments of characters in jeopardy and quite a bit of smoking, if that sort of thing bothers you.","""The Artist"" is a film everyone should see because it's joyous .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 800 people have died in a recent malaria outbreak in northern Cameroon, one described by public health officials as ""a severe and sudden epidemic."" Doctors treating more than 12,000 victims of the disease say those who died in the past three weeks were mostly young children and pregnant women. Heavy rains have flooded the region around Maroua, giving mosquitoes ideal breeding conditions. ""This is a severe and sudden epidemic. I see no end in sight,"" Dr. Amos Ekane, a malaria specialist treating more than 2,000 victims in Maroua, told CNN. Wednesday, a panel of Cameroonian journalists on state radio criticized the government for not spreading the news about the outbreak and not requesting international aid. According to the Public Health Ministry, more than 12,000 people are seriously ill and have been admitted to hospitals. But there are fewer than 10 treatment centers are available to help those who've contracted the mosquito-borne illness, and thousands of children and women are forced to sleep in the open or in overcrowded rooms without mosquito nets. ""Three of my children have died here. Here is my wife lying helplessly with drips tied to this tree,"" Abubakar Ardo Miro told CNN, pointing out the conditions at the overcrowded Maroua regional hospital. ""Only a few qualified physicians are available in the regional government hospital to handle malaria cases. This cannot yield a favorable result,"" Ekane warned. The Cameroon Medical Council -- a body governing the medical core in the West African nation -- estimates a ratio of one doctor to every 40,000 patients. Less than 1,000 physicians currently work in the country, the council says, and toil under poor conditions and low wages. ""This is really a mess to the Cameroon government,"" Tataw Eric Tano, a newspaper publisher in Cameroo, told CNN by phone. The government footed the bill to transport thousands of voters to parliamentary and municipal elections earlier this month, he said, but is not transporting dying patients to other areas with less-crowded hospitals. Observers have criticized President Paul Biya of ignoring the mounting malaria death toll as he focuses on lavish preparations to celebrate his 31 years in the presidency November 6. ""Even the propaganda state radio CRTV is talking against this,"" said political analyst Prince Tanda. Health experts blame the upsurge of malaria cases on the poor use of malaria nets that were distributed free of charge among nearly 9 million Cameroonians in 2010. But a dwindling economy and the scarcity of food has forced some families to use the nets for other purposes. ""There is no reason for me to sleep under this net while my children need food to eat,"" Elias Mbengono, a local fisherman, told CNN as he demonstrated how he could use the nets to catch fish for his family. Climate change researcher Kevin Enongene said recent heavy rains and flooding in Northern Cameroon have transformed villages into mosquito breeding grounds. Lake Chad continues to spill water over its banks and no levee has been created to stop the flood, Enongene said. ""This should be taken seriously,"" he added. Public health experts are now targeting the heads of families in a daily campaign to stave off the malaria epidemic in Maroua. ""Sleep under the mosquito bed net. Do not use them as fishing nets,"" one campaign banner read. But state public health officials are raising fears that the death toll could reach the thousands in the next few weeks if international support is not received soon. More than 660,000 people around the world died from malaria in 2010, according to the World Health Organization.","Hundreds of thousands of people die every year from malaria, WHO says .

"MUNICH, Germany (CNN) -- Juliane Koepcke is not someone you'd expect to attract attention. Plainly dressed and wearing prescription glasses, Koepcke sits behind her desk at the Zoological Center in Munich, Germany, where she's a librarian. Juliane Koepcke fell more than 3kms after the plane in which she was traveling broke up in midair. Yet this unassuming middle aged woman has one of the most exciting and unbelievable stories of tragedy and survival to tell. It was Christmas Eve, 1971, when Koepcke, then aged 17, and her mother boarded a Lockheed Electra turboprop for a flight from Lima, Peru, to Pucallpa in the Amazonian rainforest. Her parents, both famous zoologists, ran a research station in the jungle studying wildlife. The airline, LANSA, had already lost two aircraft in previous crashes. ""We knew the airline had a bad reputation,"" Koepcke told CNN, ""but we desperately wanted to be with my father for Christmas, so we figured it would be alright."" The flight was supposed to last for less than an hour and for the first 25 minutes everything was fine, Koepcke recalled. ""Then we flew into heavy clouds and the plane started shaking. My mother was very nervous. Then to the right we saw a bright flash and the plane went into a nose dive. My mother said, 'This is it!'"" An accident investigation later found that one of the fuel tanks of the Lockheed Electra had been hit by a bolt of lightning which had torn the right wing off. ""We were headed straight down. Christmas presents were flying around the cabin and I could hear people screaming.""  Watch Koepcke tell her dramatic survivor's story » . As the plane broke into pieces in midair, Koepcke was thrust out into the open air: . ""Suddenly there was this amazing silence. The plane was gone. I must have been unconscious and then came to in midair. I was flying, spinning through the air and I could see the forest spinning beneath me."" Then Koepcke lost consciousness again. She fell more than three kilometers (two miles) into the jungle canopy but miraculously survived with only minor injuries. Ninety-one other people aboard Flight 508 died. Koepcke says she is not a spiritual person and has tried to find logical explanations for why she survived. ""Maybe it was the fact that I was still attached to a whole row of seats,"" she says. ""It was rotating much like the helicopter and that might have slowed the fall. Also, the place I landed had very thick foliage and that might have lessened the impact."" In any case she survived with only minor injuries. Her collarbone was broken, her right eye swollen shut, she was suffering concussion and had large gashes on her arms and legs. ""I didn't wake up until nine o'clock the next morning. I know this because my watch was still working. So I must have been unconscious the whole afternoon and the night. When I came to I was alone, just me ... and my row of seats."" Her ordeal was far from over. Rescue planes and search crews were unable to locate the crash site and Koepcke was stranded in the jungle alone. But she had spent years on the research station with her parents and her father had taught her how to survive in the rainforest -- she knew how to cope in that environment. """"He said if you find a creek, follow it because that will lead to a stream and a stream will lead to a bigger river and that's where you'll find help."" The day after the crash she found a creek and started to wade down stream, but it was tough going. The only food she had was some candy she had found at the crash site and her wounds were quickly infested with parasites. ""I had a cut on my arm and after a few days I could feel there was something in it. I took a look and a fly had laid her eggs in the hole. It was full of maggots. I was afraid I would lose my arm. Later, after I was rescued it was treated and more than 50 maggots were found inside. I still wonder how so many maggots could have fitted into that little hole, it was no bigger than a one euro coin."" As she travelled downstream, Koepcke discovered more wreckage from the plane -- and found some of the crash victims. ""I found another row of seats with three dead women still strapped in. They had landed head-first and the impact must have been so hard that they were buried almost two feet into the ground. ""I was horrified -- I didn't want to touch them but I wanted to make sure that my mother wasn't one of them. So I took a stick and knocked a shoe off one of the bodies. The toe nails had nail polish on them and I knew it could not have been my mother because she never used nail polish."" Juliane continued through the rainforest, wading through jungle streams infested with crocodiles, piranhas and devil rays. ""Sometimes I would see a crocodile on the bank and it would start into the water towards me, but I was not afraid. I knew crocodiles don't tend to attack humans."" After 10 days, starved and exhausted, Koepke finally came upon a small boat and a hut on the river. She stayed there, hoping to be rescued. The next day a group of Peruvian lumberjacks found her and brought her to the next town. She became known as the miracle girl and was hounded by Peruvian media, receiving hundreds of letters from people she had never met before. ""It was so strange,"" she says, smiling. ""Some of the letters were simply addressed 'Juliane -- Peru' but they still all found their way to me."" The events of 1971 still haunt Koepcke and she says the memories are especially clear when she is confronted with airline disasters like last month's Air France crash off the coast of Brazil. ""It just horrifies me. I only hope it all went quickly for those on board.""","German girl, 17, was only survivor of 1971 plane crash in Peruvian rainforest .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- A woman wailed as security guards dragged her out of the briefing room used to provide updates on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. She is the mother of one of the passengers, and her protest is but one sign that patience is fraying among the relatives of the missing. The families of the passengers have been mostly out of the spotlight as Malaysian authorities spearhead a mission to find the plane. But as day 12 rolled around with no answers, the frustration became evident. Not knowing the fate of their loved ones weighs heavily on the family members, who are desperate for answers. Three women, relatives of the passengers, staged a protest at the Kuala Lumpur hotel where the world's media is staying. Their efforts were cut short by security guards who removed them through a crush of reporters, dragging one as she screamed. Anger as relatives confront officials . ""I don't care what your government does,"" one woman shouted, referring to the Malaysians. ""I just want my son back."" The flashes from dozens of cameras lit up her face as she spoke. The woman identified herself as the mother of Li Le, a 36-year-old Chinese national aboard the missing plane. ""My son,"" she said, weeping. ""I just want my son back."" Another woman, wearing a blue shirt, white baseball cap, sunglasses and a face mask, raised her right arm as she demanded more information from the Malaysian government. ""We need media from the entire world (to) help us find our lost families and find the MH370 plane,"" the woman said. ""We have no information at all. ... They only say 'keep searching' -- from South China Sea to Malacca Strait to Andaman Sea."" Why no phone calls from the plane? She and the other families waiting in Kuala Lumpur said they aren't satisfied with ""the Malaysian government's inaction."" ""What we need is to know the truth, to know where the plane is,"" she shouted. ""We have had enough. Malaysian government are liars."" Guards then escorted the women out, apparently against their will. The screams of Li Le's mother were piercing as she was dragged through a sea of reporters. The other two women were led out by guards. All three were taken to a room in the hotel, and Malaysian authorities blocked the door. Afterward, Malaysia's acting defense and transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein expressed ""regret"" about the incident, which he promised to look into. ""One can only imagine the anguish they are going through,"" Hussein said in a statement. ""Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing."" How do passenger jets change flight paths? Relatives wait in Beijing . The agony of the wait was felt not just in Kuala Lumpur. Families in Beijing -- the scheduled destination for Flight 370 -- also gather daily for a briefing with officials. Ye Lun, whose brother-in-law is on the missing plane, says every day is the same. He and his group leave the hotel in the morning for a daily briefing, and that's it. They go back to the hotel to watch the news on television. The deepening mystery has taken its toll on the families. Ye's sister -- the wife of one of the passengers -- has become very unstable, he said. ""Every morning, she feels that she's got hope when she comes to the briefing. Then they simply say those blurry things again,"" Ye said. ""Then she loses hope again."" He continued: ""It's like this every single day. She always hopes that a miracle will happen, but it doesn't. I don't know when this miracle will happen. How many days have we got left, I don't know."" Ye's brother-in-law is a veteran of the Malaysia Airlines' Kuala Lumpur-Beijing route, a silver-level frequent flier. The airline's handling of the situation is so unpopular that the families in Beijing are talking about potential lawsuits. Ye asked for an envoy from the airline to confer with the families to explain the details of the situation. ""The longer the wait, the bigger the mental shadow we have,"" he said. That's not to say relatives are giving up. For proof, all one needs to do is look at a board inside a conference room of Beijing's Lido Hotel -- inscribed with heart-wrenching messages such as, ""Little Ling, why don't you call home?"" and ""We're waiting for you to come home for dinner."" One reads: ""Dear Dad, please come back safe. I just want to see your face, hold your hands and hear your teachings."" Experts answer your questions . Air France flight unity . In a show of solidarity, some families of the victims of Air France Flight 447, which also went missing before its wreckage was found, wrote an open letter to the families of Flight 370 passengers. The letter expressed dismay about the vague and sometimes contradictory statements from the Malaysian government, and it suggested that families turn to their home governments to pressure the Malaysians for details. The letter was written by a group of relatives of Flight 447 victims who lived in Germany. The president of the group, Dr. Bernd Gans, said it is necessary for the families of Flight 370 to stick together and to pressure officials ""to make sure they are getting answers."" Gans lost a daughter in the Air France tragedy, and he said coping with the incident becomes easier over time. ""Yes, in the first moment you are completely paralyzed, but life goes on, it's necessary,"" he said. For now, the Flight 370 families are in limbo -- frustrated by the lack of clear information, while fending off their worst fears and clinging to hope. It's all consuming, said Peter Weeks, whose brother and ""best friend"" Paul, originally from New Zealand, was on Flight 370. ""You spend 24 hours a day thinking about it, really -- every waking moment and even in the few moments of sleep,"" Weeks told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. ""The first thing I do is go straight on the Internet in the morning and see if there's any update. And every day ... there's no solid information about anything."" Sarah Bajc, the partner of American Philip Wood, initially thought the plane had been commandeered or hijacked. As time elapsed, that theory has gained followers. ""All my friends were starting to think that perhaps I was just in denial, and I was even starting to doubt myself a little bit,"" Bajc told CNN'. ""So when all of this new evidence started to come out, it gave me confidence that I wasn't so crazy after all."" She is no aviation expert, but she has intuition, and it tells her that the passengers, including Wood, are still alive. Whoever is holding the passengers hostage in this scenario can achieve their goal without hurting anyone, she said. There is no evidence that this is the case, but it is her message to any possible captors. ""Miracles do happen,"" she said. ""They happen every day.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Bales of cocaine have been washing up on the beaches of Cornwall. Frank Partridge and the bale of cocaine he found while out beach-combing with his dog. The latest was found on Pentreath beach, on the Lizard Peninsula, Britain's southernmost point. Frank Partridge, 57, a semi-retired electrical engineer, regularly takes his dogs beach-combing. On Monday afternoon, at low tide, he found more than the usual driftwood. ""The dogs went up to the parcel first,"" said Frank. ""I went up and saw what it was. I'd heard rumors of a lot of drugs washed up on Cornish beaches. I looked at it and thought I wouldn't leave it there because, sure as eggs are eggs, by the time I got back it wouldn't be there."" On February 7, suitcase-sized packages wrapped in sacking were found on Bude beach, in north Cornwall. The following day, more packages were found at Helston on Cornwall's southern coast. Police have confirmed the parcels contained a total of 50 kilos of cocaine, with an estimated street value of £2.5 million ($4.96 million). Another two consignments were recovered last weekend. On Saturday, a parcel was found at Portscatho, a fishing village further along the coast from Pentreath. A fishing boat hauled in a parcel off the Lizard peninsula on Sunday. The results of the forensic analysis are not yet available, but police have said that the bales are similar in appearance to those seized earlier. Frank's haul attracted attention immediately. ""When I brought it back, I put it outside the cottage. A man came up with a camera. We took some family snaps beside it. ""The police asked me if I could keep this one quiet. Well, it's impossible in a Cornish village."" Rumors circulating in Pentreath as to the possible origins center around a Liberian container vessel which found herself in thirty foot seas off Cornwall, at the beginning of February. The ship was forced to call for assistance from Falmouth Coastguard, after the Master was seriously injured and her Del Monte deck cargo was swept overboard. ""Some people in the village reckon that the drugs were hidden among the bananas in the containers,"" said Frank. Investigating police say there is not yet any idea as to the origins of the drugs. They ask that anyone finding similar packages should not touch them but should call the police as a matter of urgency.

That was where the most recent ""pay for Facebook"" story originated, and it's where this doozy comes from, too. National Report is a satire site, though it's sometimes hard to tell if you just breeze through the headline and first few sentences of a story. We all know The Onion is fake news. (Well, almost all of us, anyway). But sites such as National Report and The Daily Currant aren't so well-known or, for that matter, nearly as funny. In fact, the more cynical among us may think these sites are intentionally trying to drive traffic by pushing out seemingly real stories about hot topics. You know ... like how a controversial government policy addresses an unprecedented and frightening, if isolated, disease outbreak. NBA, NFL, Congress ... or none of the above? If you like football and you hate Congress, well, welcome to 97% of the population of the United States. (Full disclosure: We made up that statistic.) But if you responded to the NFL's recent off-the-field troubles by sharing a post that shows that our lawmakers are bigger lawbreakers than our football stars, you fell for a fake. The good people at Snopes, the Web's BS meter since 1995, are all over this one, as is PolitiFact. The so-called statistics -- 36 members of Congress have been accused of spousal abuse, three have been in jail for assault, 84 were arrested for drunk driving in a single year -- change from version to version. But these figures all go back to a 1999 online article that provided no source for its statistics and named none of the supposedly corrupt members of Congress. Under scrutiny, it was later retracted. Sorry, Pluto's still not a planet . But some smart people say it should be. So there's that. Space geeks everywhere were saddened in 2006 when Pluto lost its status as our solar system's ninth planet. So you can forgive them, perhaps for jumping the gun on social media when news appeared to hit recently that the tiny, chilly chunk of rock has been restored to its rightful place. Call this one a combination of enthusiasm, confusion and exaggeration. What actually happened was that the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics held a September 18 debate on whether Pluto should be restored to its full glory and four days later released the results of a vote by the audience. Pluto won. But in reporting that event, which has no official influence, many blogs and news sites appeared to go a bit too far, at least with their headlines. ""The People Have Voted: Pluto is a Planet!"" Time blared. ""Pluto Is a Planet Again, According to Harvard Astronomers,"" another blog announced. So you can see how some of us who grew up with ""Interplanet Janet"" rushed to the incorrect conclusion that we have ""nine planets large and small"" again. Don't microwave your iPhone .

"(CNN) -- Russia said it does not plan to use the International Space Station beyond 2020, casting a shadow on U.S. plans to continue cooperation with the country and extend the life of the orbiting laboratory until at least 2024. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin told reporters Tuesday that Russia is looking to redirect its attention to other projects after 2020. His comments come as tensions mount over U.S. sanctions on Russia for its role in the crisis in Ukraine. NASA released a statement saying that the U.S. space agency ""has not received any official notification from the Government of Russia on any changes in our space cooperation at this point."" NASA added that cooperation in space has been a hallmark of U.S.-Russian relations, even during the Cold War, and it pointed to the past 13 years of continuous human presence on the orbiting outpost. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki echoed that the United States and Russia have a long history of cooperation in space and that the United States hopes it will continue. At present, the U.S. space program relies on the Russian program. Ever since NASA retired its aging shuttle fleet in 2011, the only way for astronauts to reach the space station is aboard a Russian Soyuz craft. Private industry has filled a gap by ferrying cargo in low-Earth orbit, and NASA has awarded cargo resupply contracts to the California-based SpaceX and the Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corporation. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Rogozin's statements. Orbital spokesman Barron Beneski told CNN that the company did not have an immediate reaction to the Russian reports, and he noted that the company's contract calls for the delivery of cargo to the space station through 2016. The United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada are the principal entities involved in the operation of the International Space Station. The history of human spaceflight .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- President Raúl Castro has moved quickly since taking the reins of power from his ailing brother, Fidel, last year to boost food production by putting more land into the hands of profit-earning farmers. Government officials hope that, with more land into production, the nation would need to import less food. Just east of the capital, Jose Luis Silva grows cabbage, corn and plantains on a small plot, one that he would like to see expanded. ""I'd work it, and I'd work it well,"" he said. ""It would solve their problem, and it would solve mine."" When he says ""their problem,"" he is referring to Cuba's disastrous state-run agriculture industry. Cuba imports about 80 percent of the food it rations to the public. Additionally, state-run television reports that half of the country's state-owned land is either unused or underused. A thorny bush called marabu fills many of the unused fields and has become a symbol for the failure of agriculture. Last year, Raúl Castro himself bitterly joked about how much of it he could see along the highway. Now, changes are under way. Farmers can buy tools like machetes, hoes and metal sharpeners rather than requesting them through a long, bureaucratic process. The president of Cuba's Small Farmers' Association says a more important change is occurring: The Communist government has begun to allow for-profit farmers to work large amounts of land.  Watch changes in the way Cuba runs farms » . Phil Peters, a public policy analyst for the Lexington Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank based in Arlington, Virginia, says that change represents an admission that past policies have failed. ""When Raúl Castro gave his first major speech to the Cuban people last July, he ridiculed the bureaucracy that shackles the agriculture sector,"" he said. ""And he ridiculed the lack of productivity, and he didn't mince many words. So, yeah, they are admitting that large parts of the agriculture sector aren't working and they've got to shake it up."" Farmers like Silva just hope these changes will mean a chance to earn a better living. But the government's recognition that those working for profit are the most productive could mean other reforms are on the way.

"(CNN) -- When the Economist Intelligence Unit released its most recent Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, the spotlight, as ever, fell on the world's most expensive cities. Tokyo came in on top of the pile of places that drain the color from your wallet, while Osaka and Sydney were second and third. World's most expensive cities . But what about the other end of the spectrum -- how about a holiday where you can live it up without hemorrhaging cash? The world's cheapest city is Tehran, Iran, followed by Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Both have rich heritages, but Iran and Saudi Arabia are better known for generating controversial headlines than attracting tourists. In third place, however, Panama City popped up. The Central American country is best known for hats and a canal -- now we've got a reason to make sure our passport is up to date! Over the past decade, Panama has enjoyed the fastest growing economy in Latin America. As a result, new hotels and restaurants have sprouted across the capital. Healthy competition is keeping standards high, and Panama City has a plethora of top-quality, luxury experiences for cut prices. Logistics . Before stepping foot outside the airport, you've started saving. All tourists arriving at Tocumen International Airport are given travel insurance for 30 days. It is granted by the Panamanian Tourism Authority; the government has provided the service since it signed an $8 million deal with Assicurazioni Generali. Next up: cash. The Panamanian balboa is linked with the dollar and the two currencies are interchangeable, so there's no paying a commission for changing currency. As for airport transfers, a standard taxi to the city center costs $25. You could arrive in style with a Panama Luxury Limousine for $88.50. The same service would cost $145 in Rio de Janeiro, or $427 in Tokyo. More cents can be saved (and you can do your bit for the environment) by avoiding bottled water. Tap water in Panama City is safe to drink, not a given in the region. Hotels . Waldorf Astoria Panama . Latin America's first Waldorf Astoria hotel opened in March 2013. Book early and rooms start from $159. Located on Calle Uruguay, aka ""restaurant row,"" the 248 rooms have metallic, glass and crystal decor designed by Miami-based Ba-Haus/KNF. A stay here certainly doesn't feel like skimping. The outdoor swimming pool is covered in gold tiles, there's a swanky spa and each guest is given a personal concierge. Overseen by head chef Kalych Padro Alvarado, four restaurants include a sushi bar and a French brasserie. Waldorf Astoria Panama, 47th and Uruguay Streets; rooms from $159; +507 294 8000 . Casa del Horno . Founded in 1501, Panama was a Spanish colony for three centuries. Known as Casco Viejo, the historic part of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Casa del Horno (Oven House) sits on a colorful cobbled street in Casco Viejo. Surrounded by churches and plazas, it's one of many colonial buildings to be renovated in recent years, making Casco Viejo feel like Cartagena in neighboring Colombia. Built in the 1850s, the eight-room hotel was originally a bakery. Stone walls remain, alongside art deco wooden furniture and all the modern fixtures, including LCD TVs and iPod docks. The hotel's cafe and restaurant are reached via the pavement, avoiding the clinical feel that can befall hotel restaurants. Casa del Horno, Avenue B and Eighth Street; +507 212 0052; rooms from $250 for two-person suite . Tantalo Hotel . The year-old Tantalo Hotel has 12 rooms, each designed by a different Panamanian artist. Designs range from gentle and flowery to seductive, with red-and-black walls and silver ceiling studs. Downstairs, a ""living wall"" is made from 900 lush plants. The restaurant dishes up Panama-style tapas, such as octopus with lemongrass and ginger. Cocktails, wine and several dishes to share will cost around $30 a head. Each month, paintings in the communal areas change. ""The idea is for the fourth floor to be like an art gallery that you can wander around with a drink,"" says assistant manager Catalina Bermudez. The big, buzzing rooftop bar has panoramic views and hosts events including a monthly Cuban music evening. Tantalo, Avenue B and Eighth Street; +507 262 4030; rooms from $120 . Canal House . Canal House is a creaky 19th-century mansion in Casco Viejo, and checking in feels like staying with a stately aunt. With just three suites set around a large wooden staircase, this high-end guesthouse is owned by two sisters and loved for its quirky charm and homemade cooking. It was called ""the finest accommodation that exists in Panama,"" by Panama 980 magazine. Canal House, Calle 5a Este; +507 228-1907; rooms from $195, suites from $320 . Dining and nightlife . Restaurante Angel (Via Argentina No. 6868, El Cangrejo; +507 263 6411) is the city's special occasion Spanish restaurant. You'll get impeccably prepared seafood, beef, lamb and rabbit in an elegant setting with crisp service for around $20-25 per person, not including drinks. There's big food and big atmosphere for reasonable prices at Las Bovedas (Plaza Francia; +507 228 8058), a French restaurant set in the arched vaults of a 300-year-old fort in Casco Viejo. Fresh seafood, steaks, snails (it's a signature dish) and great service are the hallmarks at this dressy classic. Panamanian food is a mix of European, Asian and African tastes. The best way to experience the fusion is at Maito (Calle 50, Coco del Mar; +507 391 4657). It's not often you order plantain hash with fried ceviche and come out smiling. Then there's the ropa vieja main of shredded beef with a goat cheese sauce. Panamanian chef Mario CastrellÃ³n trained in Barcelona and returned to his hometown with a mission to start a ""new gastronomy"" inspired by the canal -- the idea being that the waterway literally brings these different influences to the city. For the indecisive gourmand, Manolo Caracol (Avenida Central and Calle 3, +507 228 4640) serves a set nine-course tasting menu for $36 per person. Busy and smart, yet relaxed, the open kitchen churns out seafood, meat and vegetable dishes made with local ingredients, the majority of which come straight from chef Caracol's farm. Highlights include seafood bisque, corn tortilla with chorizo, and coconut fish curry with yuca tortillas. Not exactly luxury but tasty and cheap all the same, Mercado del Marisco seafood market (Avenida Balboa and Calle Eloy Alfaro) is a great place to wander. When Anthony Bourdain came to Panama, this was his first stop. Here you'll find rows of al fresco stalls selling ceviche for $1.25 a cup. There's also an upstairs restaurant with a larger menu with hearty fish stews and filleted sea bass. New Casco Viejo coffeehouse Bajareque sells the world's most expensive coffee, Geisha, for a reasonable $6.50 a cup. Panama is the world's only producer of this rare coffee, which typically retails for $172.50 per kilo. Fitting for its name, Geisha coffee mainly sells in Japan and costs $50 a cup at Tokyo coffee shops like Horiguchi Coffee. The primary nightlife spots are Calle Uruguay and Casco Viejo, both of which are lined with places to sample Panama's four national beers, Panama, Balboa, Suarana and Atlas, for a couple of dollars. In Casco Viejo, Habana Panama (Calle Eloy Alfaro y Calle 12 Este; +507 212 0152), isn't just the hottest dance spot in the city, it's an atmospheric salsa hall that recalls the elegance of old Cuba and Ricky Ricardo style. Live bands typically don't hit the stage until midnight. For a typical $10 cover you'll find fewer better shows (or more fun) anywhere. Then there's Barlovento (Calle 10 A; +507 6613 4345), a tropical-style rooftop bar where the beautifuls hang. With views over Casco Viejo (rather than the Panama City skyline over at TÃ¡ntalo) and a DJ playing a mix of electronic music and Latin beats, the place is pumping on the weekends. Again there's a $10 cover charge (if you're male that is; women enter free) but you'd easily pay a $25 cover for the same deal in Mexico City. Attractions . Panama Viejo . The oldest section of the city, Panama Viejo was burned to the ground in the late 17th century by British pirate (or privateer, depending who you ask) Sir Henry Morgan. The crumbling remains of towers, forts and houses run along the coast waiting to be explored. The visitors center has a model showing the city before Morgan showed up. Panama Viejo; +507 226 8915; $3 for museum, $4 for ruins, $6 for both; open Tuesday-Sunday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Panama Canal . The Panama Canal took 250,000 people more than 10 years to build (not counting the original failed French-led effort), transports 40 boats each day (taking eight to 10 hours per transit) and costs an average of $85,000 per vessel. Luckily, tours are a little less, and a partial transit with Canal & Bay Tours costs $135 per person, including breakfast, lunch and transfer though two sets of locks. The Panama Canal celebrates its centenary in 2014, and to mark the occasion it's undergoing a $5.25 billion modernization and expansion. Progress is best viewed from above. Air Charter Panama arranges one-hour helicopter tours covering the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the canal from $749 for three passengers in a Robinson R44.","Panama City is the Americas' most affordable capital city, but luxury standards often prevail .

"(Health.com)  -- Erase extra flab with these super-effective tricks. IN THE GYM . 1. Catch the running bug. You'll continue to burn fat after your jog: People who run for at least four hours a week melt more calories than non-runners, even when they're not running, a Yale University School of Medicine study reports. 2. Crank it up early. Working out harder during the first half of your workout and taking it easier during the second burns up to 23 percent more fat than doing the opposite, according to a study from The College of New Jersey. 3 & 4. Go hard -- and make it quick. Staying at 80 percent of your max heart rate for 40 minutes can amp your metabolism for 19 hours afterward, research published in Obesity notes. And doing a shorter workout at 75 percent of your max aerobic capacity will give you a greater metabolic boost than sweating longer at 50 percent, a Colorado State University reveals. Health.com: 10-minute ab workout . 5 to 7. Lift dumbbells ... slowly. More muscle equals mega metabolism boost. Strength training can help you trim major fat, research reveals -- and doing super-slow (versus normal speed) reps increases strength by 50 percent. Plus, using dumbbells activates more muscle fibers than using machines, explains Gregory Haff, Ph.D., an associate professor in the exercise physiology department at West Virginia University. 8. Speed up, slow down. Alternating bouts of high-intensity and low-intensity cardio has been shown to torch pounds. 9. Put on weight (literally). Wearing a weighted vest (about 10 percent of your body weight) while walking can boost your calorie burn by 8 percent. 10. Download Rihanna, not Brahms. Listening to up-tempo songs actually makes you run faster and harder than listening to slower-paced music, British scientists say. 11. Let kettlebells ring. Not only does working out with kettlebells build muscle, but doing it for 20 minutes burns as many calories as running at a 6-minute-mile pace for the same amount of time. Health.com: Get gorgeous arms . 12. Keep it up. As few as 80 minutes a week of aerobic or weight training helps keep you from regaining belly fat after losing weight, according to researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 13. Add poles. Use Nordic poles while you walk, and you'll burn 20 percent more calories, says research from The Cooper Institute in Dallas. 14 & 15. Lift first, nix the rest. Doing strength training before cardio can torch more fat than cardio alone. And if you do one move after another without pausing, ""you'll see more gains in strength and muscle mass,"" says Dr. Pierre Manfroy, M.D., consultant for the book ""100 Ways to Supercharge Your Metabolism."" 16. Add pounds. Lift heavier weights for fewer reps to make your workout more intense -- and burn more fat -- Manfroy says. 17. Try aromatherapy. Exercisers who inhaled strawberry and buttered-popcorn scents torched more calories than those who sniffed neutral odors, according to research from the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. Health.com: Aromatherapy massages: touch and scents can vaporize stress . 18. Box yourself in. Wii boxing knocks out nearly twice as many calories as some other games, like Wii golf. 19. Kick it. Playing soccer not only torches more fat and builds more muscle than jogging, but it feels less tiring, Danish research reveals. 20. Stay in shape. Fit people have more fat-burning metabolites in their blood than couch potatoes do, scientists say. IN THE KITCHEN . 22. Get more protein. Eating a protein-packed breakfast and lunch helps you burn more post-meal fat than if you eat lower-protein meals, according to Australian research. 23 & 24. Guzzle green tea -- or coffee. Downing five 5-ounce cups of green tea a day boosts metabolism, says Lyssie Lakatos, R.D., author of ""Fire Up Your Metabolism."" Two cups of coffee will also do the trick, one study shows. Health.com: Is coffee healthier than you think? 25. Have an omelet. Eating two eggs for breakfast while dieting will help you trim more weight and body fat than if you ate the same amount of calories noshing on a bagel, scientists say. 26. Stay above 1,200 calories... ""The average person's body goes into starvation mode if she eats fewer than 1,200 calories a day,"" says Eric Berg, author of ""The 7 Principles of Fat Burning."" ""That's stress, and stress creates more belly fat."" 27. ... and cut calories gradually. If you diet, don't trim more than 250 calories a day. Cutting calories too quickly slows your metabolism down, Dr. Manfroy says. 28 to 33. Munch on these. Almonds, cherries, yogurt, grapefruit, whole grains, and spicy foods have all been shown to torch fat. Health.com: 7 foods that fight fat . 34. Fuel up right. Eating a low-glycemic-index breakfast (such as muesli and peaches) will help you burn more fat during a subsequent workout than eating a high-glycemic-index meal (like waffles), researchers from the University of Nottingham reveal. 35. Think before you drink. Sipping as few as 90 calories' worth of vodka can slow your metabolism by 73 percent, one study shows. 36. Graze. Women who go without eating for long periods are more likely to have higher body-fat percentages than women who nosh more regularly, one study notes. 37. Dine like a Greek. Eating a diet rich in monounsaturated fat (think olive oil, avocados) can help trim both weight and fat, research published in the British Journal of Nutrition shows. 38. Stop gorging. Your body can only handle so much food at a time, so stick to 600 calories or less per meal to maximize fat-burning, says Leslie Cooper, co-author of ""Flip the Switch: Proven Strategies to Fuel Your Metabolism and Burn Fat 24 Hours a Day."" 39. Skip juice. Reaching for an apple instead of apple juice is not only better calorie-wise, but it'll also do a better job of boosting your metabolism, Dr. Manfroy explains. Health.com: The best ways to boost your metabolism . IN YOUR LIFE . 41 & 42. Get C and D. Vitamin C can help you burn more fat, and D may help you lose fat, research notes. Aim for 400 to 500 mg of C and 800 mg of D a day. 43 & 44. Walk more (in denim). Researchers found that fitness-friendly offices (think treadmill desks, mobile headsets) helped people trim pounds and fat, as did wearing jeans to work, since dressing casual encourages you to move more. Wear comfy clothes when you can, pace while on the phone, and stand while chatting with co-workers. 45. Add fish oil (And work out). Taking 6 grams of fish oil per day and hitting the gym three times a week can help nix body fat, an Australian study reveals. 46. Work the day shift. Keeping nontraditional hours lowers levels of hormones that trigger satiety, increases blood glucose and insulin levels, and raises levels of the stress hormone cortisol (which can drive you to eat more), scientists say. 47. Nix the boob tube. Cut your TV time in half, and you'll burn more calories each day, research from the University of Vermont suggests. Health.com: Too much TV linked to earlier death . 48. Go mental. People who visualized themselves training a specific muscle boosted the strength in that muscle group, researchers found. 49. Eat a smaller dinner. Your body may not digest food -- and burn fat -- as efficiently if you down a huge meal right before bedtime, especially because your metabolism is slower while you sleep, Dr. Manfroy says. 50. Jump-start your morning. Wake up your metabolism -- and get fat-burning started -- by doing some sort of exercise within the first few hours of being awake, Cooper suggests. 51. Get your snooze on. Sleep for a solid 81D 2 hours instead of 51D 2, according to research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, and you'll lose more fat. Sweet dreams!

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has issued a posthumous apology for the ""appalling"" treatment of Alan Turing, the British code-breaker who was chemically castrated for being gay. A portrait of Alan Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery's ""Gay Icons"" exhibition. The apology came after more than 30,000 people signed an online petition on the UK Government Web site calling for the government to recognize the ""tragic consequences of prejudice that ended this man's life and career."" Turing was just 41 years old when he committed suicide, two years after undergoing a court-ordered chemical castration. He had been found guilty of gross indecency for having a homosexual relationship. The punishment in 1952 was either a prison sentence or chemical castration. Turing chose the latter. In a statement on the British Government Web site, Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged Turing's ""outstanding"" contribution during World War II. ""He truly was one of those individuals we can point to whose unique contribution helped to turn the tide of war,"" he wrote, adding, ""The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely."" Turing is considered one of Britain's greatest mathematicians, a genius who is credited with inventing the Bombe, a code-breaking machine that deciphered messages encoded by German Enigma machines during World War II. He went on to develop the Turing machine, a theory that automatic computation cannot solve all mathematical problems, which is considered the basis of modern computing. Last month, the curious lack of public recognition for Turing's contribution to the war effort and computing in general motivated computer programmer John Graham-Cumming to campaign on his behalf. The author of the ""Geek Atlas,"" a travel guide for technology enthusiasts, started an online petition, and soon attracted high-profile signatories including scientist Richard Dawkins, actor Stephen Fry, author Ian McEwan and philosopher A.C. Grayling. ""I was surprised by both the number of people who signed and the fast response from the government,"" Graham-Cumming told CNN. He said the Prime Minister had called him personally to relay news of the apology. Stories about calls for a British apology were carried in newspapers in France, Switzerland, Spain, Austria, Portugal Poland and the Czech Republic. Supporters set up an international petition which attracted more than 10,000 signatures.","Online petition calling for apology for Alan Turing elicits response from UK PM .

"(CNN) -- Just as the sun peeked over the horizon, Brian Fuchs arrived at work. Eight floors up, he opened a Diet Coke, looked out his office window at the frozen Nebraska plains and smiled. Maybe the rest of America is tired of this winter's punishing snows, but Fuchs and his colleagues are thrilled. ""Yeah, realistically we do like seeing that snow accumulation,"" he says, ""because that water will go into the water cycle. There is a lot of moisture going into lakes and reservoirs and that is a good thing."" Fuchs is with the National Drought Mitigation Center based in Lincoln. For the past decade, the center staff has watched dry conditions hurt farming, tourism and even city water supplies, so they can see good in this winter's storms, and even in the catastrophic floods that ravaged Colorado in September. Last year at this time, well over half the country was in drought. ""Now, it's 37.6%,"" Fuchs says, ""so we've had some improvement over that time."" Whether a big snowfall is seen as lovely, treacherous or both depends, like beauty, on the beholder. Certainly, millions of Americans who have been pounded by storms are not pleased. Schools have lost days of education, airlines have lost millions of dollars, cars have been wrecked, houses plunged into darkness, and the entire industry of Valentine's Day has been thrown into a heart stopping tailspin. I can't even guess how many young lovers in the East were scrambling to find flowers and chocolates after being snowed in for the critical days before the holiday. It could be worse, of course. Modern meteorology gives us better warning about bad weather than mankind has ever known. Sure, the Al Roker- Bill de Blasio dustup suggests there is still room for disagreement about forecasts. But back in 1888, when the U.S. Weather Bureau was in its infancy, an unexpected blizzard on the Great Plains left more than 200 people dead, many of them children who were trying to get home from rural schools. It was a national tragedy, unimaginable today. Yet greatness grows beneath the drifts, too. At the same time as that disaster in the West, some of Europe's greatest impressionist painters were enthralled with winter scenes. Monet, Renoir, Gaugin, Pissarro, Sisley and many others stood in the freezing cold to capture landscapes of snow and ice. Although the whites, blues and grays of the winter scenes are often overlooked even by art enthusiasts, who tend to favor the bold colors of spring and summer, the artists themselves were fascinated by the delicate interplay of light on the luminous, frozen surfaces. Well before the impressionists took off, acclaimed painter Frederic Edwin Church, from Connecticut, unveiled a winter masterpiece. ""The Icebergs"" is huge, powerful and cools the Dallas Museum of Art even on the steamiest days. The Russians, of course, would love to have more snow at Sochi, where soaring temperatures have threatened to turn ski slopes into mudslides. But in Moscow, at the famed Tretyakov Gallery, one of the world's most treasured paintings is a winter scene. No one knows the identity of the beautiful young woman riding in a sleigh in Ivan Kramskoi's ""Portrait of an Unknown Woman,"" but it captures something of the rare spirit of people around the world who find beauty and contentedness living in cold climes. Brutal snow and cold have informed many of the arts, and sometimes in ways that produce visceral reactions. Read Jack London's short story, ""To Build a Fire,"" about a man freezing to death in the Yukon, and chances are you'll start to shiver. Recall the frosted face of Jack Nicholson at the end of ""The Shining,"" and the cold fairly seeps into your bones. Science also enjoys the cold. Core samples of ice from the poles tell us volumes about climate change, natural history and perhaps even the origins of the Earth itself. Tiny bubbles, sealed in the ice, allow us to sample the air of the ancients. Mammoths and men alike, frozen in time, have been preserved in remarkable ways, giving us glimpses of life on Earth long, long ago. In the early 1990s, a German couple hiking around the Alps found the head and shoulders of a frozen man poking up from the ice. Turns out he was something of a time traveler. Researchers concluded he died during the Bronze Age, some 3,000 years before Christ. Yet the perpetual winter of the mountains preserved him so well, scientists knew he ate venison not long before dying, and they could even tell the color of his eyes. Brown. Greatness has come in from the cold. Polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship, The Endurance, was crushed by Antarctic ice in the early 1900s. His expedition was a failure. But the daring journey he and his men made in an open boat to escape the savage cold made him into a hero. Like I said, as hard as this winter has been, it's all in how you see it. So, with much of the West still hurting for water, maybe it's not surprising that back in Lincoln, Brian Fuchs and his pals look at reports of blizzards blanketing much of the nation and say, ""From our perspective here, we wish we'd seen a little bit more.""

"(CNN) -- Vladimir Putin's gala address before Russian parliamentarians and officials Tuesday surprised no one when he announced Russia's annexation of Crimea. The interesting part was his distorted view of Russian history, and his proclamation that a bizarre kind of simultaneously aggrieved and aggressive hyper-nationalism is now Russia's official ideology. In discussing Ukraine, however, Putin seemed to go out of his way to suggest he had no aggressive intentions and was not planning to divide the rest of the country. Listening to Putin, one could easily forget that Russia is and for many centuries has been the largest country in the world and that it acquired its territories by imperialist expansion often accompanied by genocide and ethnic cleansing. Instead, Putin prefers to see Russia as having been permanently on the defensive, a victim of both Western and Communist machinations: ""In a word, we have all the reasons to believe that the notorious policy of containing Russia, which was pursued in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, is continuing to this day. ""They are constantly trying to drive us into some corner, because we have an independent position, because we defend it, and because we call things by their names and are not hypocrites,"" he said. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, according to Putin, it was the turn of the Bolsheviks to aggrieve Russia. Putin conveniently ignores that the vast majority of Bolsheviks were Russian and that the party Lenin founded was institutionally Russian as well. No matter. Putin says: ""The Bolsheviks, for a number of reasons -- may God judge them -- added large sections of the historical South of Russia to the Republic of Ukraine. This was done with no consideration for the ethnic makeup of the population, and today these areas form the southeast of Ukraine. Then, in 1954, a decision was made to transfer Crimean Region to Ukraine. ... What matters now is that this decision was made in clear violation of the constitutional norms that were in place even then."" Once again, Putin's historical myopia is breathtaking: Nikita Khrushchev's decision to grant Crimea to Ukraine was as constitutional as anything any Soviet Communist leader did in the entire period of the USSR's existence. The Soviet Union rested on illegality and the systemic violation of human and civil rights. If Khrushchev was wrong, then that's only because the USSR was wrong and should never have been created in the first place. Unsurprisingly, there is no room in this narrative for the nation that Russian imperialism almost managed to annihilate -- the Crimean Tatars. Russia conquered the Crimean Tatar khanate in 1783. Afterward, the Russian authorities forced the Tatars out of their ancestral homeland and replaced them with settlers from Russia. Tens of thousands of Tatars died or were killed; some two-thirds had to leave the Crimea. In 1944, the ethnic cleansing was completed when Stalin expelled the entire Crimean Tatar population -- about 200,000 people -- to Uzbekistan and some other Soviet regions. About half died on the way. It was only in the late 1980s that they began returning to their homeland to find that their land and their homes had been occupied by Russian settlers. Instead, Putin primarily explains why Crimea matters to Russia: ""The graves of Russian soldiers whose bravery brought Crimea into the Russian empire are also in Crimea. This is also Sevastopol -- a legendary city with an outstanding history, a fortress that serves as the birthplace of Russia's Black Sea Fleet ... symbolizing Russian military glory and outstanding valor."" And what of the Crimean Tatars? Here's Putin: ""True, there was a time when Crimean Tatars were treated unfairly, just as a number of other peoples in the USSR. There is only one thing I can say here: Millions of people of various ethnicities suffered during those repressions, and primarily Russians."" The mendacity is astounding. The Crimean Tatars were not just ""treated unfairly"" by some vague force. They were subjected to genocide by a Russian totalitarian empire. Russians also ""suffered,"" but the brunt of the suffering fell, as Yale historian Timothy Snyder describes in ""Bloodlands,"" on Poles and Ukrainians. Despite all this victimization, Putin's speech loudly asserts that Russia is back: It's mad as hell and it won't take being humiliated anymore. This Russia, the new Russia, is both victim and bully: . ""Today it is imperative to end the hysterics and to renounce the rhetoric of the 'Cold War,' and to recognize an obvious thing: Russia is an independent and active participant in international life, and it has, like other countries, its national interests, which must be acknowledged and respected."" And then, remarkably, Putin adopts a conciliatory tone with respect to Ukraine. Naturally, he first denounces the new democratic government as illegitimate and in the thrall of imaginary fascists and asserts Russia's obligation to help defend Russians and Russian speakers from their supposed assaults and predations. Here's the soft and fuzzy Putin: . ""I appeal to the people of Ukraine. I sincerely want you to understand us: Under no conditions do we wish to bring you harm, to insult your national feelings. We have always respected the territorial integrity of the Ukrainian state. ... ""Don't believe those who terrify you with Russia, who shout that other regions will follow Crimea. ... We want Ukraine to be a strong, sovereign and self-sufficient state. ... We want peace and amity to come to the land of Ukraine, and together with other countries we are ready to provide full cooperation and support to that end. But I repeat: Only the citizens of Ukraine are able to bring order to their own home."" If these words were sincere, then they may mark a significant departure from the war-mongering rhetoric Putin employed at his March 4 press conference, where he stated he ""wasn't worried"" by war with Ukraine. Indeed, if sincere, Putin has clearly stated that he will not invade the rest of Ukraine and attempt to annex some of its southeastern provinces. Is Putin being truthful, or is the speech a smoke screen for further aggression? We don't know, of course, but now that Putin has gone on record as having nothing but peaceful intentions toward Ukraine, the international community would do well to remind him of that whenever the temptation to rattle sabers on Ukraine's borders and foment trouble in Ukraine's southeast proves too strong for him to resist.

"(Mental Floss) -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's memoir, ""A Journey,"" is sparking all sorts of picketing and protesting around the U.K., so we thought it might be a good time to take a look at a few presidential memoirs from this side of the pond. Here are a few things you might not have known about former presidents' literary output. Best choice of (possible) ghostwriter . Ulysses S. Grant should have been on sound financial footing when he finished his second term in 1877. He was arguably the world's most famous war hero, and he had been in the White House for eight years. In reality, though, his finances were anything but stable. Following a two-year trip around the world and a disastrous investment with a swindling banking partner, Grant found himself on the verge of bankruptcy; he even had to sell his Civil War mementos to pay off debts. He still had access to that great presidential cash cow, the memoir, though. Mark Twain approached Grant about publishing the war hero's memoirs with a plum deal that would give Grant 75 percent of the profits as royalties. Cash-strapped Grant had little choice but to accept Twain's offer, and the Civil War-focused ""Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant"" hit stores in 1885. Mental Floss: 8 U.S. presidents with statues abroad . Grant's memoirs were an instant runaway hit. Twain's company made the clever choice of employing former Union soldiers in full uniform as salesmen, and the book became one of the best sellers of the 19th century. Today, the book is considered by many to be the best presidential memoir ever written, but there's some controversy over who actually did the bulk of the writing. Twain always claimed that he had only made slight edits to Grant's text, but the prose was so strong that many suspected Twain himself had ghostwritten the book. Sadly, Grant didn't get to see the success of his book; he died shortly after its completion. But his widow Julia banked over $400,000 in royalties from the memoir. Worst financial windfall . While today's presidents are financially set for life from publishing and consulting gigs when they leave the Oval Office, just 57 years ago that wasn't the case. When Harry Truman's term ended in 1953, he didn't have any savings to speak of, and he felt taking a corporate job would cheapen the presidency. His only income was a $112-a-month pension from his days in the Army. Mental Floss: 13 unique presidential gifts . Truman decided that the best way to drum up some cash was to sell his memoirs, for which he got a $670,000 advance. By the time he paid taxes and his assistants, though, Truman only netted a few grand on the two-volume work. Eventually his financial straits grew so dire that Congress passed the Former Presidents Act in 1958 to guarantee annual pensions of $25,000 to former presidents. Best use of revisionist history . History has judged James Buchanan pretty harshly; most scholars rank him among the worst presidents we've ever had. You know who was a bit more sympathetic in his appraisal of the failed Buchanan administration, though? James Buchanan. In 1866 Buchanan published the first-ever presidential memoir, the magnificently titled ""Mr. Buchanan's Administration on the Eve of Rebellion."" Mental Floss: Elvis visits the White House . In his book, Buchanan tried to set the record straight about his presidency. By the time Buchanan's memoir came out, the Civil War had ended and Abraham Lincoln had become a national icon, so Buchanan attempted to liken his own policies to Honest Abe's. Sure, Buchanan had opposed abolitionists and was considered to be a doughface -- a Northerner with Southern sympathies -- but in his mind, he was just like Lincoln and felt history would someday set the record straight. Unfortunately for Mr. Buchanan, it didn't. Most honest use of a ghostwriter . Ronald Reagan was quick with a quip, and he dropped one of his best one-liners at the release of his 1990 memoir ""An American Life."" Publisher Simon & Schuster held a press conference for the release of the book, which Reagan had supposedly penned ""with the editorial assistance of Robert Lindsey."" In truth, it sounds like Lindsey may have received only the slightest assistance from Reagan. The Gipper joked at the press conference, ""I hear it's a terrific book! One of these days I'm going to read it myself."" Mental Floss: See Nancy Reagan and Mr. T celebrate Christmas . Worst sales loss at the hands of a spouse . Poor Gerald Ford just couldn't win any respect. When his memoir ""A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford"" came out in 1979, his wife, Betty, also had a memoir on the stands, ""The Times of My Life."" Betty gave her husband a T-shirt that read ""Bet My Book Outsells Yours"" for his birthday. To make the crummy gift even worse, she was right. At least Ford was in good company; Nancy Reagan's memoirs also outsold her husband's. Quickest read . Calvin Coolidge earned the nickname ""Silent Cal"" for being famously taciturn, and his memoirs weren't uncharacteristically verbose. Coolidge takes the prize for the shortest presidential memoir -- ""The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge"" comes in at a tight-lipped 247 pages. Biggest advance . Bill Clinton got an astounding $15 million advance from Knopf for his 900-page behemoth of a memoir ""My Life."" When Clinton signed the deal, publishing analysts figured the book would have to sell upwards of 800,000 hardcover copies just to break even, but Knopf aggressively ordered a presidential-record-breaking first run of 1.5 million copies. Mental Floss: Where are they now? Famous photo edition . To give you a sense of perspective, Richard Nixon's memoirs sold 330,000 and were considered a huge hit; to justify this advance, Bubba was going to have to really move some books. But as of 2008, Clinton had not just surpassed that monstrous advance; he had pocketed nearly $30 million from sales of ""My Life"" and his follow-up, ""Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World."" Hilary wasn't doing so badly for herself in the publishing game, either. Her book ""Living History"" made her more than $10 million. Longest takedown of FDR . Like Buchanan, Herbert Hoover doesn't get much love from historians, but he certainly stood up for himself. After leaving office in 1933 after what's generally agreed was a fairly disastrous stint, Hoover needed 18 years to crank out the first tome of his mammoth three-volume memoir. His main goal? Explaining why his presidency wasn't really a failure and bashing the policies of his successor, Franklin Roosevelt. Mental Floss: Oh, the places your ashes will go! Among Hoover's most memorable smears of FDR: ""The effort to crossbreed some features of Fascism and Socialism with our American free system speedily developed in the Roosevelt administration.""

"(CNN) -- A lot of us were rooting for Jimmy Fallon on Monday night. Given the contentious recent history of the host chair -- Leno to O'Brien to Leno -- he was standing on a media trapdoor, with critics just waiting to pull the lever. Early reviews say he not only survived one of the highest-pressure debuts ever -- he killed it. If nothing else, a big debut buys you time. But does victimless humor -- the kind that does not slice, dice and julienne its subjects -- have legs in a culture that likes its entertainment with a serrated edge? It's a question that applies across demographics -- from the prized millennials, who have grown up on the discord of reality television; to the baby boomers, who are decades into acerbic late night as we know it -- and will have to adjust to bits like slow rolling the news. It's a tough neighborhood, with Jimmy a little like Bambi walking the streets of a war zone. Or, as Stephen Colbert jokingly (but not inaccurately) said on Monday night: ""Welcome to 11:30, bitch."" One of Fallon's established competitors, David Letterman, in a recent monologue said that Rosie O'Donnell met her fiancÃ©e when her car broke down and Rosie ""pulls up behind her in her tow truck."" (Pause for nervous laughter at the lesbian joke.) Rosie, predictably, was not amused, firing back to Dave: ""I don't remember making fun of you when you had sex with all your interns."" Jimmy's humor can be topical, but almost always with a softer touch: Hillary Clinton saying she doesn't know if she'll run for president is like him saying ""I still don't know if I'll have a beer on St. Patrick's Day."" Somehow, I don't think there will be any fights with Rosie. And in a broader context, it's a tough entertainment media in general. Look no further than reality television, populated by macho slimeballs, back-biting boyfriend stealers and assorted high achievers in the low art of interpersonal nastiness. There is a whole new genre allowing us to make fun of rural America. No, Mama June, we're not laughing with you. There is even research that the mean-spirited swamp that is reality TV is starting to seep into the culture in general. Researchers at Iowa State University showed 250 women three scenes: one violent, one frightening and one showing gossip -- including a woman who ostracized a friend. All got a response, but the highest mental arousal was category three, which the researchers termed ""relational aggression."" In other words, watching people be mean to each other may ""prime the brain"" to be mean ourselves. Jimmy's (we're all friends just joking around) humor might be up against something even bigger -- right in his demographic sweet spot. A University of Michigan Institute of Social Research study looked at 72 studies of empathy among college students over 30 years. They found that empathy -- the ability to identify with others and relate to their feelings -- has dropped an incredible 40% since 2000. Among the reasons: the technology-driven isolation, a generational sense of entitlement and social media's ability to call attention to ourselves. Also responsible is the winning-is-everything sports culture and huge paydays for those who climb to the top of their fields. All told, if there were a sequel today to Dr. Thomas Harris' classic ""I'm OK, You're OK"", it might be: ""I'm OK, You're Pathetic."" Can Jimmy save the world from mean humor? Doubtful; there is a big market for cynical, biting and demeaning. But let's hope that his first show says there is also room for just plain funny. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Critics were waiting to see Fallon fall on his face, but he scored big .

"(CNN) -- You've spent weeks, months, maybe years, planning this day. From the moment that one (or both) of you said ""Yes!"" it's been a whirlwind of wardrobe fittings, seating charts, cake tastings, envelope stuffings, raised glasses and perhaps a teary meltdown or two. Now all that stands between you and your soon-to-be lawfully wedded spouse (who is looking more gorgeous today than ever) is a few yards of aisle. And all of a sudden, that seems like the longest walk of your lifetime. Even those of us who are hazy on some details of our wedding day recall exactly how we got to our beloved's side, and who accompanied us there. Whether it's expressed in a beloved song, an unconventional companion or creative transportation, the long trip down the aisle is an opportunity to make your wedding day unique. For many people in the Western world, Richard Wagner's ""Bridal March"" from the 1850 opera ""Lohengrin"" is the music by which the great stride occurs. Those getting married in the Roman Catholic Church (which doesn't cotton to the inclusion of secular music in a religious ceremony) aren't presented with a suite of approved music, but according to a quote often attributed to St. Augustine of Hippo, ""He who sings prays twice."" Accordingly, the happy couple is asked to consider a few criteria from Catholic catechism in making their song selections: three principal criteria: beauty that is expressive of prayer, participation of the assembled (everybody sing along!), and solemnity befitting the occasion. That considerably slims down the songbook, but hey -- there's always the reception. For the rest of us, the world is our jukebox, and that can be a daunting decision. It's a moment that sets a tone for the ceremony, the crowd and possibly even the marriage itself. A video from the wedding procession of Jill Peterson and Kevin Heinz went viral in 2009 and has been viewed more than 84 million times on YouTube since. The ""JK Wedding Entrance Dance"" -- which was later recreated by characters in an episode of the sitcom ""The Office"" -- involved members of the wedding party dancing down the aisle, followed by the tumbling groom, and eventually the beaming, bobbing bride. Sales of their processional song, ""Forever"" skyrocketed as the video's popularity soared -- but the perception of the artist, Chris Brown, came crashing back down to Earth as allegations of abuse against his on-again-off-again girlfriend Rihanna surfaced. Heinz and Peterson took action and set up an initiative for donations and ad dollars to be contributed to the Sheila Wellstone Foundation, which works to end domestic violence. According to an update on the couples' website, as of August 1, 2013, $47,641 had been raised for the cause. But it's a rare couple that undergoes that sort of musical scrutiny. For most, song choice is a deeply personal decision, based on shared experiences, values, the ceremony's aesthetics and old favorites -- and it's plain old fun to engage in. For Sandy Fong-Navalta, that song was ""All I Ask of You"" from Andrew Lloyd Weber's ""Phantom of the Opera,"" strummed by a harpist as her 10-year-old niece, Sumiko, accompanied her on the walk. Fong-Navalta explained, ""My father died in 1989 and the thought of getting married and walking down the aisle alone always terrified me. I swore to myself I would never, ever get married. But, when I met the love of my life in 2005, my fears were replaced with love and trust."" The song still brings tears to her eyes whenever she hears it, Fong-Navalta said. ""Say you need me with you now and always. Promise me that all you say is true. Love me, that's all I ask of you. Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime. Let me lead you from your solitude. Say you need me with you here beside you, anywhere you go, let me go, too. That's all I ask of you. ..."" Tiffany Barry found a more raucous reflection of her path to the altar in the Nine Inch Nails song ""La Mer."" She explained, ""Because of a nasty divorce between our parents, my brother and I really raised each other growing up. Because of this, I felt it fitting that my brother, two years younger, escorted me to the aisle where I then walked by myself to my waiting husband."" The song, which is in a more melodic style than bandleader Trent Reznor's usual industrial style, featured lyrics (which translate from the French to ""when the day comes, I will become the sky and the sea, and the sea will come to kiss me, for I am going home, and nothing can stop me"") that Barry felt were ""a perfect marriage of music and meaning"" and embodied her feelings toward her husband, who was raised near the sea. ""Through marriage we were becoming one and creating our home,"" she said. Rea Frey looked to her second aisle walk as a chance to right the past. At age 22, she had almost vomited and fled the scene. ""My father gripped my arm and said, 'We can make a run for it,'"" she said, ""But the music started playing, the bills were paid and everyone was already there. So, I made my way towards my groom."" Five years later, things hit a sour note and the divorced Frey vowed not to get married -- or spend so much money -- ever again. That was before she met Alex. She walked down the aisle solo that time, after knowing her now-husband for just a few months. ""I am an adult and I didn't feel like I was being given away,"" Frey said. ""I wanted that moment to be onIy about us, just as our marriage would be. I chose to walk down the aisle to 'Hallelujah' (the Jason Castro version of the Leonard Cohen version), which is my absolute favorite song."" Key lyrics: ""I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you. And even though it all went wrong, I'll stand before the lord of song. With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah."" Wedding decorator Preston Bailey has gussied up the nuptials of hundreds of celebrities and hifalutin couples around the globe, but his own -- at age 64 to partner Theo Bleckmann -- was the first same-sex ceremony he'd crafted. And it had to stand out. At midnight on February 13, 2013, Bailey rang in Valentine's Day by rolling down the aisle hidden inside a 10-foot, Reem Acra-designed sculpture as Bleckmann sang ""You Make Me Feel So Young"" and then ""Now We Are Free"" from the movie ""Gladiator"" played. The structure featured a body double of Bailey at the top wearing a voluminous wedding gown. ""When my guests first saw my body double rolling down the aisle wearing a 10 foot dress, they thought it was me, completely losing my mind,"" Bailey said. ""As the structure got closer to the altar, I opened the bottom of the dress and casually walked out, bouquet in hand. The room went wild. This entrance set the tone for an evening of fun and laughter. I couldn't have wanted anything more for the night,"" he recalled. (No doubt this was amplified and encouraged by the presence of officiant Joan Rivers.) For my now-husband and me, the march was an opportunity to explore the songs that were touchstones for us both -- and a chance for our friends to participate. Our pick: the instrumental Dream Academy version of ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want."" While the words would not be sung aloud, we both (along with most of our guests) knew what they were: ""Good times for a change. ... So for once in my life, let me get what I want."" He took his place at the altar to the tune originally recorded by The Smiths, and I walked in (with my Irish wolfhound, Mordred, at my side so my dad could tend to my disabled mother) to a duo of musician friends singing The Magnetic Fields' ""The Book of Love."" Key lyrics: ""The book of love has music in it. In fact, that's where music comes from. Some of it is just transcendental. Some of it is just really dumb. ... But I, I love it when you give me things. And you, you ought to give me wedding rings.""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The Thai government on Sunday extended a curfew in the capital and nearly a third of the country's provinces for at least two more nights, but shortened the hours when residents are required to stay off the streets. In his weekly television address, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said officials would extend the curfew, which had been scheduled to end Sunday morning. He said the curfew would stretch from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. -- starting two hours later and ending an hour earlier than it had for the past three nights. He said officials would review whether a curfew remained necessary in the coming days. In his address, Abhisit repeated his push for national reconciliation. He said an independent fact-finding committee would review events that took place during the protests and officials would conduct a national survey to determine peoples' needs and wishes. Timeline of Thailand's political crisis . ""Everything is calm and returning to normalcy,"" he said, according to the Thai News Agency. Crews are cleaning up Bangkok's streets and government agencies and schools will reopen Monday, Abhisit said. More than 1,000 businesses have registered for assistance after sustaining damages as protests, riots and clashes between anti-government demonstrators and troops rocked Bangkok's main shopping district, he said. Officials imposed a curfew in Bangkok on Wednesday after government troops surged into Lumpini Park, where anti-government Red Shirt demonstrators had amassed. What were the protests about? After hours of intense street battles, five anti-government protest leaders were taken into custody. At least three more turned themselves in Thursday. Red Shirt leaders called off the protest, but some did not heed the call as smaller riots erupted in the city. More than 30 buildings -- including a bank, a police station, a local television station and Thailand's biggest shopping mall -- were set ablaze. At least 50 people have been killed in clashes in the past several weeks and nearly 400 people injured, government officials said. The Red Shirt opposition members support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. They had been protesting for weeks, demanding that Abhisit dissolve parliament and call new elections.","NEW: Thai government to extend curfew in Bangkok for two more nights .

"Washington (CNN) -- Meet the Koch Sisters. Karen and Joyce Koch aren't actually related. One is a teacher from Michigan, the other a retired social worker from New Jersey. But the Kochs are the faces of a new AFL-CIO campaign designed to contrast the ""shared values"" of organized labor against those of the Koch brothers, the conservative business titans behind millions of dollars' worth of secretive campaign spending this election year. The ""Koch Sisters"" effort is launching Thursday with television ads starring the two women airing on national cable television, an official at the labor federation said. ""We are not related to the Koch brothers, those right-wing billionaires,"" the two women say in one of the ads set to air. ""We are just two average women who have raised families and worked hard all our lives."" Democrats boost Begich after controversial ad . The women don't make an overt pitch to voters, other than directing viewers to an AFL-CIO website that accuses the Koch brothers of using ""their wealth to subvert democracy and enact a self-serving agenda at the expense of working families."" The ads also seem designed to put a female-friendly face on organized labor in a year when Democrats are working feverishly to exploit their advantage over Republicans among women voters. The campaign will include targeted Web ads and social media in Michigan and Kentucky, two states with robust union populations that have competitive Senate races this year, as well as future television ad buys.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A long line snaked around the perimeter of a large hotel conference room as people waited eagerly to meet a former Texas congressman who they view as an icon in the modern libertarian movement. Ron Paul had finished delivering a nearly hour-long speech to a gathering of Florida libertarians on Friday night, and he was now signing copies of books, t-shirts, posters and even a few paintings. Paul might have retired from Congress last year, but he hasn't gone away quietly. The eclectic group of activists who backed the Texas Republican in his back-to-back presidential runs still support him even as it appears many of them are ready to turn to his son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, if he follows in his dad's footsteps and runs for president in 2016. Rand Paul, who was elected in 2010, has quickly become a national figure in his own right due to his willingness to buck traditional GOP ideology, and a strong following among young, libertarian minded voters and self-described ""tea party"" activists. Rand Paul's appeal among the grassroots has helped rank him, according to early polling, as a top contender for the Republican presidential nomination if he runs. And unlike his father, Rand Paul is more closely aligned with the GOP establishment. But as Rand Paul's star continues to rise, where does he stand among Ron Paul's most ardent supporters? While a few attendees at the conference argued Rand Paul is too moderate, many say he strikes the right balance that the movement needs — a pragmatic choice to its principled core. Or as Chris Sankey, a 29-year-old from Tampa, put it: ""Rand is running the company, and Ron's chairman of the board."" Walking a fine line . It's clear many Ron Paul supporters don't view Rand as a replacement for his father. In their eyes, Ron is still the trailblazing legend that sparked a libertarian resurgence. Rand Paul: Will his star continue to rise? To the movement, ""he's the intellectual godfather,"" said conference attendee Glen Chancy, 44, of Apopka. But in multiple conversations, conference attendees said they thought that Rand Paul's plan is to spread the so-called liberty message in a more strategic way than his father's vocal and largely-purist method. In Ron Paul's 2008 and 2012 presidential bids, he unabashedly called for an end to the Federal Reserve and other huge areas of government that many Americans consider necessary. The son's tactical approach has some Ron Paul supporters concerned that he will compromise his libertarian positions. In the past year, Rand Paul has taken heat for his stance on NSA leaker Edward Snowden, who is praised as a hero by many in the libertarian movement, including Paul's father. But Rand Paul says Snowden still broke the law and should serve time in prison, even though he credits the ex-agency contractor for disclosing important information. Rand Paul addressed the Florida summit Sunday morning live via video link. The event was hosted by Campaign for Liberty, an organization founded by Ron Paul in 2008. During Rand Paul's brief video session to the conference — a vastly smaller audience than the crowd that turned out for his father's speech Friday night — Rand Paul was asked by an attendee what he thinks should be an appropriate sentence for Snowden. While the senator has previously said Snowden deserves ""a few years"" in prison, he said Sunday he has ""mixed emotions"" and he doesn't know what kind of penalty Snowden should get. But he argued whistleblowers should have more protections under the law and joked that Snowden and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper should share the same prison cell. Browse through the vast web of blogs and websites that fall under the libertarian umbrella, and you'll find a number of opinions that say Rand Paul's position on Snowden should come as no surprise, claiming the senator has always been a weak representation of libertarian views. Some attendees at the conference noted the Snowden issue was a point of contention but said they can overlook it, in part due to Rand Paul's aggressive push against the Obama administration over the very data collection programs that Snowden exposed. ""You see Rand Paul compromise a lot more with Republicans and Democrats than you would with Ron Paul,"" said Andy August, another conference attendee. ""But it's politics. You got to play the field a little bit, and he's willing to play that ball and he's willing to get our issues and our ideas out into the mainstream. That's what's important."" 'Line in the sand' Foreign policy is also an arena in which Rand Paul has created concern among some of his father's supporters. Ron Paul is a strict non-interventionist. He decries foreign aid, including to Israel, and wants to rid the world of U.S. military bases overseas. Rand Paul takes another step towards White House run . ""The last thing in the world we need is to be involved in the internal affairs of the other nations,"" the former congressman said in his speech Friday. As seen in Rand Paul's position on the recent unrest in Ukraine and Russia's annexation of Crimea, the senator isn't as staunchly opposed to getting involved in other parts of the world. While he voted against a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine, he still favors technical and security assistance to the country. Last month, he argued that President Barack Obama was failing to project Ronald Reagan's ""peace through strength"" policy, and he called for the United States to be even more aggressive on its diplomatic efforts relating to Russia. ""It is our role as a global leader to be the strongest nation in opposing Russia's latest aggression,"" he wrote in an opinion piece. It's his evolving stance on foreign policy that Ron Paul supporters—at least the ones at this conference—most fear will drive Rand Paul too far to the left. But Republican pundits say it will also be his biggest hurdle to cross in terms of attracting potential donors to a presidential campaign. ""If Rand Paul is serious about running for president, he's going to have to make peace with 'national security Republicans,' the big donors that care about national security,"" said Republican strategist John Feehery, adding he'll need to ""distinguish himself from his father"" in that regard. Sankey, the conference attendee who also runs a t-shirt company called The Liberty Outfitters, said if Rand Paul trends more mainstream on foreign policy, that shift could become a deal breaker with Ron Paul supporters. ""The liberty movement has to ask itself where is the line in the sand when it comes to being principled and winning,"" he said. 'Playing the field' But Rand Paul's differences with his dad aren't the first things on the minds of Ron Paul supporters when they think about the senator. Many are excited that he's adopted an ambassadorial role and appears to be somewhat effective at attracting more Republicans with his libertarian-leaning views. He's been climbing in the 2016 horse race polls in recent months. In March, he did what his father never did and took the top spot in a CNN/ORC International survey. He's boosting his profile with an aggressive travel schedule, headlining GOP events across the country and making appearances in liberal hotspots, like the University of California at Berkeley. Among 2016 chatter, his name increasingly comes up as a potentially viable candidate, not simply a figurehead for libertarian ideas, as his father was often portrayed in his two White House bids. Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights . Jeff Frazee, executive director of Young Americans for Liberty, told CNN last month that he disagreed that Rand Paul's recent outreach will put him at risk of compromising his views. Rather, he said the senator is simply translating libertarian views in a way that's more appealing to other voters. ""He is the son of Ron Paul. He has Ron Paul's DNA in him, and I think it's kind of engrained all the way down to who he is,"" Frazee said. Cory Massimino, an 18-year-old student at Seminole State College, disagrees. He thinks Rand Paul is a lot more moderate than his father, but he added that's not necessarily a bad thing. For many libertarians, he said, they see Rand Paul as the movement's best chance of permeating Washington with their views, even if he's not a pure libertarian. ""I try to remember to not let the perfect get in the way of the good,"" he said.","Ron Paul might have retired from Congress last year, but he hasn't gone away quietly .

"Kiev (CNN) -- Russia's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a treaty Thursday to annex the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting tougher sanctions from the United States. Russia responded with its own sanctions against a list of U.S. officials and lawmakers. After Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had presented the treaty and urged lawmakers to accept the region as a part of the Russian Federation, the document was approved on a vote of 443 to 1. Speaking ""on behalf"" of Putin, Lavrov had told the State Duma that folding Crimea into Russia was needed to protect ethnic Russians there. ""I am certain that passing the document will become a turning point in the destiny of multi-ethnic nations of Crimea and Russia, who are related with close ties of the historical unity,"" Lavrov said. The political crisis has been the biggest blow to Russia's relations with the West since the Cold War. Approval of the treaty in the State Duma was in no doubt as Russia has stood defiant despite Western leaders denouncing Moscow's actions as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and a breach of international law. European Union leaders said Thursday they will sign a political association agreement with Ukraine and add 12 more people to the list of individuals targeted for sanctions, including Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin. EU member states also are threatening possible tougher targeted measures, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters. ""We make clear that failure to settle the crisis peacefully, and any steps by Russia to destabilize Ukraine, will have far reaching consequences,"" he said. ""And by that we mean consequences on relations in a broad range of economic areas."" U.S. and EU officials had already imposed sanctions on more than two dozen Russian and Crimean officials, and urged Russia to avoid escalating the crisis -- a call Moscow has ignored. But U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday announced more sanctions on individuals and one bank in response to Russia's annexation moves. He also signed a new executive order that authorizes possible further sanctions on what he called ""key sectors"" of the Russian economy if Moscow does not act to deescalate the situation. ""This is not our preferred outcome. These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy,"" he said. ""However Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community."" Russia must respect ""basic principles"" of sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said, adding that the United States should also provide financial support for Ukraine's government and people. ""We want the Ukrainian people to determine their own destiny and have good relations with the United States, Russia, Europe -- anyone they choose,"" he said, calling for continued diplomatic efforts. Sanctions lists . The new U.S. sanctions target 20 officials, including senior Russians and ""cronies"" who hold significant influence in the Russian system, as well as one bank that holds ""significant"" resources, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. That bank was listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as Bank Rossiya. The individuals named by the Treasury include major Putin allies, both in the Kremlin and in business. Among the 16 government officials listed are Putin's chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov; the speaker of the State Duma, Sergey Naryshkin; and Viktor Ozerov, chairman of the Security and Defense Committee of the Russia parliament's upper house. Four others were named as members of the government's inner circle. They are financier Yuri Kovalchuk, labeled Putin's personal banker by a senior U.S. administration official; magnate Gennady Timchenko, whose activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin, according to the Treasury; and businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg. Besides Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin, The expanded EU sanctions target list includes two advisors to President Putin, Sergey Glazyev and Vladislav Surkov, as well as the chairwoman of the Russian Senate Valentina Matvienko. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the new round of U.S. sanctions would be ""significantly more powerful than the first one."" The latest round ""hits significant economic interests that are fairly close to the ruling circles in Moscow. It will be noticed,"" he said. Russia responded with sanctions against nine U.S. officials and lawmakers, including speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives John Boehner, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid and Sens. John McCain, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, according to a list published by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said the lawmaker was ""proud to be included on a list of those willing to stand against Putin's aggression."" McCain responded, ""I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off, my Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea."" The U.S. Treasury said Bank Rossiya is controlled by Yuri Kovalchuk and is the 17th-largest bank in Russia. It has $10 billion in assets and handles the accounts of some top government officials, the Treasury said, adding that the bank has relationships with banks in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. The bank also provides services to the oil, gas and energy sectors, it said. ""As a result of Treasury's action, any assets of the persons designated today that are within U.S. jurisdiction must be frozen,"" the Treasury said. British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters at the EU Heads of State or Government summit there would likely be more asset freezes and travel bans. Finland's Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade Alexander Stubb told CNN more names would be added Thursday. ""There will probably be over 10 new names on the list and then of course people are going to argue, are these people good to be on the list, bad to be on the list are they to be taken seriously and so on, but there will be more names,"" Stubb said. Lavrov told lawmakers that sanctions ""have never brought any positive results"" and that there were no legal grounds for them. Kiev defiant . Russia's defense minister assured U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in phone call Thursday that Russian troops on the Ukraine border do not intend to cross the border or take aggressive action, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. Hagel made it clear in the lengthy and sometimes ""direct"" talk with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu that the Russians bear responsibility for what happens in Crimea, including the recent violence, since they are in control there, Kirby said. While Russia insists its actions are legitimate, Ukraine's parliament said Thursday that Kiev will never stop fighting for Crimea, even if the country's new leaders have discussed evacuating military personnel from the region. In a declaration published online, the Kiev parliament said ""Crimea was, is and will be part of Ukraine."" ""The Ukrainian people will never, under no circumstances, stop fighting for the liberation of Crimea from the occupants, no matter how hard and long it is."" Putin announced the annexation of Crimea after voters in the semi-autonomous territory approved a hastily called weekend referendum on separating from Ukraine. Kiev officials unveiled new measures against Russia and the ""self-proclaimed"" authorities in Crimea. In a televised briefing, Andriy Porubiy, secretary of the national defense and security council, said that if the United Nations designates Crimea a ""demilitarized zone,"" Ukraine is prepared to evacuate its military personnel and family members. Ukraine has facilities ready to accommodate 25,000 evacuees. A statement on the Ukrainian presidential website said former Presidents Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma had asked Turchynov to redeploy soldiers who are still in Crimea to the mainland. The call was ""to protect and save lives of Ukrainian servicemen who bear service in difficult and dangerous conditions in Crimea,"" the statement said. Porubiy had also said the measures included a full-scale visa system for Russians. Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Kiev was in no hurry to impose a visa regime on Russia, since it could negatively affect Ukrainians living in the predominantly Russian-speaking east of the country. Yatsenyuk is in Brussels to sign the political part of an association agreement with the European Union. Lavrov said the intention to introduce visa regulations was ""surprising and regrettable."" As diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continue, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon traveled to Russia Thursday, where he met Putin and Lavrov. He will then head to Kiev where he will meet acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov and Yatsenyuk on Friday. Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Ban as saying during a meeting with Putin that he was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation involving Ukraine and Russia. Navy chief released . Ukraine's navy commander, detained when supporters of Russia took over the naval headquarters in Crimea, was released, the presidential website said Thursday. Amid signs the uneasy standoff between pro-Russian and Ukrainian forces could ignite into bloody conflict, about 300 armed men stormed the naval base in Sevastopol on Wednesday. They took away Ukrainian navy chief Sergey Gaiduk. Turchynov issued a 9 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) deadline for Crimea to release all hostages and stop all provocations. Kiev's new leaders had warned that if all hostages, including Gaiduk, were not released by then, authorities would take action of ""technical and technological character,"" probably meaning turning off utilities. A statement on the presidential site said Gaiduk and several other hostages had been freed. They were released during the night and were on their way to Kiev Thursday. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu had asked authorities in Crimea to free Gaiduk and allow him safe passage out of the region. The incident at the navy headquarters came a day after one member of the Ukrainian military was killed when masked gunmen seized their base near the Crimean regional capital, Simferopol. After that fatality -- the first Ukrainian military death since the Crimean crisis erupted about three weeks ago -- Ukraine's Defense Ministry authorized its forces to open fire in self-defense.

"Edinburgh, Scotland (CNN) -- Politicians made their final pleas to Scottish voters Wednesday, the last day of campaigning before they head to the ballot box to vote on independence. Opinion polls put the two sides neck-and-neck ahead of Thursday's historic referendum, which could see Scotland split from the United Kingdom. Voters will be asked the yes/no question: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" The latest poll of polls, released Wednesday by ScotCen, an independent research center, shows ""no"" at 52% and ""yes"" at 48%, with ""don't know"" voters excluded. It is consistent with results over the past week or so, which have indicated the race is too close to call. Polls suggest around 8% of voters remain undecided, making their votes crucial to deciding the outcome of the referendum. As the vote nears, emotions are running high on both sides, dividing families and polarizing communities. The leader of the pro-independence campaign, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond told ""Yes Scotland"" campaigners in Perth on Wednesday evening that they have run the ""greatest campaign in Scottish democratic history."" ""We meet on the eve of the most exciting day in Scottish democracy. And we meet here not to celebrate, not to presume, not to preempt,"" he said, acknowledging that polls were still placing the ""no"" vote in the lead. ""We are the underdogs in this campaign, as we always have been,"" Salmond said. ""We know that the Westminster establishment will fling the kitchen sink and half the living room and probably most of the bedroom at us before the close of polls at 10 o'clock tomorrow night. And therefore it behooves each and every one of us, recognizing that underdog status, to campaign with our utmost ... to persuade our fellow citizens that independence is the right road forward for Scotland."" ""This is our opportunity of a lifetime,"" he told the cheering crowd. Gordon Brown: This is everyone's country . But former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, himself a Scot, called on his fellow countrymen and women to vote ""no"" to independence with confidence. Speaking in Glasgow, he said, ""This is everyone's flag, everyone's country, everyone's culture, everyone's street and let us tell the people of Scotland that we who vote 'no' love our Scotland and love our country."" Scotland's many past and present achievements, Brown said, ""happen not outside the union but inside the union. They happen not in spite of the union but because of the union."" There were chaotic scenes as Labour Party leader Ed Miliband met with members of the public on Tuesday, forcing him to cut short a meet and greet. The issue of spending on social welfare and health care, through the National Health Service, has been central to campaigning. Questions over the economy, North Sea oil reserves and taxation have also been key. Each side has argued that it is the best equipped to create more jobs for Scotland. In a rare show of unity, the leaders of the UK's three main political parties penned a vow on Tuesday -- published on the front page of the Scottish Daily Record newspaper -- to transfer more powers to Scotland if it rejects independence. Cameron: My name's not on ballot . Prime Minister David Cameron will face tough questions over the effectiveness of the pro-union ""Better Together"" campaign if Scotland opts to leave, with critics accusing the main parties in Westminster of complacency over the vote. They have also questioned the promise of more powers for Scotland if it stays, warning that England and Wales should not lose out. Fallout from the referendum could play into the next UK general election, scheduled for May 2015. Asked by a reporter whether he would quit if Scotland chooses independence, Cameron said, ""My name is not on the ballot paper; what's on the ballot paper is, does Scotland want to stay in the United Kingdom or does Scotland want to separate itself from the United Kingdom? ""That's the only question that should be decided on Thursday night. The question about my future will be decided at the British general election coming soon."" In an interview with the Times of London, Cameron also defended the way the referendum has been handled by his Conservative-led coalition government. He said he had been right to offer only the option of independence or continued union on the ballot paper, rather than including a third option of further devolved powers for Scotland. He suggested that Scottish independence might actually be closer today if he had said no to a vote, rather than offering a ""proper, legal, fair and decisive referendum."" Scotland to leave UK? 8 things to know . John Major: Scottish people 'fed a load of pap' Former Prime Minister John Major also made an impassioned plea for Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom, telling CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the Scottish people have been hoodwinked. ""The Scottish nation have frankly, and I don't say this lightly, have been fed a load of pap by the Scottish nationalists in the belief that everything will be alright on the night,"" he said. ""Well it won't. There are very serious problems that Scotland will face if they go down this route."" Many questions remain unanswered about what will happen if Scotland votes to go it alone, including its future membership in the European Union and NATO and over the United Kingdom's future defense capabilities. In an open letter published in UK tabloid The Sun on Wednesday, 14 former UK defense chiefs warned against breaking up the union. ""At risk is the most successful alliance in history and one which has seen men and women from all parts of the country play their part in securing the liberties we now enjoy,"" they wrote. ""The division of the UK may or may not be politically or economically sensible, but in military terms we are clear: it will weaken us all."" In his own open letter to Scottish voters, Salmond urged them to look past what he called the ""increasingly desperate and absurd scare stories"" of the pro-union ""no"" campaign, and think of Scotland's future. ""Make this decision with a clear head and a clear conscience,"" he wrote. ""Know that by voting 'Yes', what we take into our hands is a responsibility like no other -- the responsibility to work together to make Scotland the nation it can be."" Opinion: Why the UK needs Scotland . Largest ever electorate . The Scottish National Party, headed by Salmond, has said it wants to remove the UK nuclear submarine fleet from Scottish waters as soon as possible. More than 4.2 million people have registered to vote, the largest electorate ever in Scotland. Any registered voter aged 16 or over who is a resident in Scotland is entitled to cast a ballot. Voters do not have to be British citizens; Commonwealth, Irish and EU citizens who live in Scotland and are registered to vote there can do so. If Scotland decides to leave the United Kingdom, it leaves behind England, Wales and Northern Ireland. CNN's Max Foster reported from Scotland and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.

"London (CNN) -- Turn down any rundown street in any one of the ""mini-Mogadishus"" that now pepper Britain's cities, and you'll see young men congregating outside what look like shuttered shop fronts. But look closer. There are no signs and no distinguishing features to help those who don't know what lies on the other side of these battered doorways. The chances are you will have stumbled over a marfish -- the cafes British Somalis come to chew the vegetable stimulant, khat. Although khat is legal in the UK, marfishes are closed off to outsiders. One marfish we attempted to enter had a surveillance camera overlooking the locked doorway -- we were repeatedly refused entry. See high-res gallery of years of chaos in Somalia . In the past, journalists have been attacked for attempting to report on the goings-on inside the cafes. For years, marfishes are been believed to be at the center of criminal activity, and now, CNN has learned, they may also be a recruiting ground for Islamic militants. Abubakr Awale is an anti-khat campaigner in the UK, and knows only too well the paranoia and isolation khat addiction engenders in the young men in the marfishes. Seven years ago he was one of them. ""Young people become vulnerable, not clearly thinking and the paranoia kicks in and that's when they start to hate the British public -- especially the police,"" Awale told us. ""They are thinking everybody is out to get them and that's exactly the kind of individuals the likes of Al-Shabaab are targeting."" The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) estimates that Britons now make up a quarter of foreign fighters in Somalia, and says Al-Shabaab is stepping up its effort to make the most of this fertile recruiting ground. ""They are moving forward, changing their techniques,"" Awale says, ""so it's no longer the Masjids and in the Madrasas they are targeting. There have been some cases here in the UK where the young people have been taken away from marfishes back to Somalia. There are now young people in the marfishes as we speak who are missing and we don't know where they are."" The families of many of these young men were too afraid to speak to us but CNN has confirmed that as recently as last month two young men aged 18 and 20 have been reported missing in London. Both were khat addicts and both their families are convinced they have been recruited to fight by Al-Shabaab. And that -- as one relative told us -- is effectively a death sentence. Fertile territory for Al-Shabaab in chaos of Somalia . The British-Somali community is one of the UK's oldest immigrant communities, tracing their roots to seamen who traveled to the UK in the 19th century. But they have also had one of the most difficult experiences of integration. According to the British government's own figures, British-Somalis have the highest unemployment rates of any immigrant community, only 50 percent have any educational qualifications, with only 3 percent gaining higher education qualifications. Unemployment especially feeds into the cycle of depression, addiction and alienation that extremists prey on. It is not just in the marfishes that young Somalis are being targeted for radicalization; the internet is now a treasure trove for radicals and Al-Shabaab boasts of having dozens of recruiters online at all hours in pro-jihad internet forums, even tailoring their videos in English to their target audience. Even those families who know their children are safely at home are not immune from extremists. One Somali mother we interviewed, whose son was recruited by Al-Shabaab online, told us her experience is an all too common one in the British Somali community. ""My son was a good outgoing boy, active, loved by many people. He started changing by becoming addicted to the internet, [he went on] many different sites like YouTube and Facebook. I started noticing a change in him, he started saying: 'Mum, take me abroad to study Islam.' I supported him as any mother would. I took him to Nairobi. After weeks staying in the school he disappeared; little did I know he had already been planning this."" She asked that we not identify her: she says although she was able to convince him to leave Somalia she still lives in fear that either the British authorities or the militant group itself will one day come after him. She told us she hopes other parents will be able to guard their children from what happened to hers. But it's not just her experience that is a common one, the fear she lives with is also shared by many of the British-Somalis we spoke to. Only a handful would allow us to film them and most were suspicious of how their stories would be used. Even those who had no direct experience or involvement with extremism were terrified that on any given night they might get a knock on the door from a police officer accusing them of terrorism or -- worse still -- an e-mail or a voicemail threat from Al-Shabaab for being ""un-Islamic"" or a ""traitor."" To an outsider like me, none of these fears seem founded, but for Somalis in the UK much of what they thought they'd left behind in their war-ravaged homeland appears to have followed them here. And as the world finally moves to act cohesively on Somalia, many of them no longer believe that anywhere is truly safe.","Analysts believe Britons now make up quarter of foreign fighters in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- Peruvian authorities have charged Joran van der Sloot with murder in the death of a Peruvian woman. Van der Sloot was arrested in June of last year, but was not formally charged until Thursday. Prosecutors are asking for a 30-year prison sentence and a restitution payment of $73,000 to the family of Stephany Flores. They also charged van der Sloot with theft. Charged alongside van der Sloot were three Peruvian drivers who allegedly helped him flee into Chile. Prosecutors want five-year prison sentences for them and fines of about $1,800. Flores was found dead in van der Sloot's Lima hotel room in May 2010. Police say van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Earlier this month, Flores' family urged prosecutors to file charges, warning that van der Sloot could be released by December unless the case goes ahead. Under Peruvian law, if a suspect's trial doesn't begin within 18 months of his arrest, he is set free. Investigators delivered their case file to prosecutors in June for a decision on charges. No date has been set for trial. But the Lima-based court said Thursday, in a news release, that a hearing on the case has been scheduled for the morning of September 12. At the hearing, prosecutors will present the charges and van der Sloot's lawyers will be given the chance to respond. The defendant has received a notice to appear for the proceeding, to which journalists and TV cameras will be allowed access, the court said. Van der Sloot's attorney said that the defense was expecting the charges to be filed, given the high-profile nature of the case. ""We think 30 years is too much for this crime since it was an isolated incident without any further acts of violence,"" Luis Jimenez Navarro said. ""We have had cases in Peru under similar circumstances that have gotten less than 25 years."" Van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which remains unsolved. In Session's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","NEW: Van der Sloot has been told to appear at a hearing on the case September 12 .
